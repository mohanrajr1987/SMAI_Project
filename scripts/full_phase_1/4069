Positive 4069 pIm doing an example of a message queue. When I look at the documentation, QueueConnection is an interface, but its being instantiated in sample code. How is this possible I know it extends the Connection interface. All explanations would be nice to help further my knowledge p
Positive 4069 pWhat would be an appropriate REST compatible approach that would allow a client to call a RESTful service in order to convert a large document to a target format p  pI was thinking about something similar to this p  ol liClient makes a codePOSTcode on codeconversionrequestcode resource with conversion configuration target type, secure key, notification resource URL in the form a hrefhttphosttobenotifiednotificationstatusid relnofollowhttphosttobenotifiednotificationstatusida that will return a request id. The conversion request would be added to an internal queue and can be modified  deleted by the client as long as the conversion is not started.li liOnce conversion is started the codeconversionrequestidcode is deleted by the serverli liOnce conversion is done the server creates a codeconversionresultidcode same id as above in 1 resource then does a PUT on the notification status resource to set it to ready and providing the key which will inform the client of the completion of its request li liWhen ready the client makes a codeGETcode on codeconversionresultidcode resource to obtain the converted documentli liIf the client went offline for any reason, he can try to retrieve the result as in 4. If the document is not ready, the client just has to wait for the notification to be sent.li ol  pHowever...p  ol liIs it a valid approach li lishould I forget about using REST and should I rather think about using SOAP and have a blocking call, knowing that I would prefer avoiding blocking calls or JMS all approaches have their proscons, and one big cons against JMS in my context is that it would require the setup of queues for all clients which may be refused note thats why I also added SOAP and JMS tags to this questionli liAny idea of how to improve the approach and what are the questions I should think about before going any further li ol  pThanks in advance for your help p  pMichelp

Positive 4069 pWe developed an Java application in which multiple Java JMS clients connect to a server, both with Websphere MQ 7.0.1.9. Each client has consumer with selector on application specific client id eg. JMSCorrelationID05014133431 on shared queues, in which server set application specific client id on messages by setJMSCorrelationID  sent to a particular client. Application specifi client ids are unique. It works fine most of the time. However, we just found some messages with client A sessionId are consumed by client B surprisingly. I checked the logs and confirmed that each client only create consumer with selector on its sessionId. In my understanding, consumer with only consume messages that match the selector criteria. One thing to note is that I used read ahead feature as our application use non persistent messages. This happened very rarely, say once a month. Any idea why this happen Any syntax error in JMSCorrelationID05014133431, should it must start with letter instead of digit Any hints are appreciated. Thanks in advance.p

Positive 4069 pI am creating a hosted system where multiple customers can send messages. I am receiving thoses messages on a JMS queue.p  pNow, all processing is done in a similar way and I want my process to poll all incoming queues for messages and handle them. Is there a way in WSO2 ESB to subscribe to multiple queuesp  pIf not possible, the workaround would be to create a seperate listener process for each queue and have this post the message to a central processing queue. But that seems to be a less clean solution and I think it will scale worse than listening to multiple queues.p  pAny ideas on thisp

Positive 4069 pIve learned a respectable amount about networking protocols in Grad School and in professional experience and sent HTTP requests programmatically using AJAX and such.p  pThe project on which I work professionally uses JMS to communicate and Im curious about how it works.p  pWhen using REST for instance one makes an HTTP request with parameters in either the URI or the message header in order to invoke a service and further describe its needs.p  pA mentor of mine at work and I were discussing how JMS works and Im struggling to understand at an application level how messages are actually sent. As far as I understand JMS in general I realize there are many implementations of JMS it is a specification for how to format data being sent.p  pIs the message itself still sent via HTTPS Could it be SMTPp  pWithout going strongexcruciatinglystrong deep I would like to understand how one would, at a code level, send a JMS message from one service to anotherp  pAm I even thinking about this correctly Can it be done any number of different ways Is there a convention thats used in the industryp  pIf someone could shed some light on JMS for me I would appreciate it.p  pThanksp

Positive 4069 pI am trying to implement a process consisting of several webservicecalls, initiated by a JMSmessage read by Springintegration. Since there are no transactions across these WScalls, I would like to keep track of how far my process has gone, so that steps that are already carried out are skipped when retrying message processing. p  pExample stepsp  ol liRetrieve A get A.idli liCreate new B for A using A.id, getting B.idli liCreate new C for B using B.id, getting C.idli ol  pNow, if the first attempt fails in step 3, I already have a created a B, and know its id. So if I want to retry the message, it will skip the second step, and not leave me with an incomplete B.p  pSo, to the question Is it possible to decorate a JMSmessage read by Springintegration with additional header properties upon message processing failures If so, how could I do thisp  pThe way it works at the momentp  ol liMessage is readli liSome exception is thrownli liMessage processing halts, and ActiveMQ places the message on DLQli ol  pHow I would like it to workp  ol liMessage is readli liSome exception is thrownli liThe exception is handled, with the result of this handling being an extra header property added to the original messageli liActiveMQ places the message on DLQli ol  pOne thing that might achieve this is the followingp  ol liRead the messageli liStart processing, wrapped in trycatchli liOn exception, get the extra information from the exception, create a new message based on the original one, add extra info to header and send it directly to the DLQli liSwallow the exception so the original message dissappearsli ol  pThis feels kinda hackish though, hopefully there is a more elegant solution.p

Positive 4069 pI have a problem by using Apache Camel in combination with Oracle Advanced Queues and JMS.p  pIts about an application to distribute messages. Messages are received and  enqueued in Oracle Advanced Queues with the help of Camel. Then they are consumed with Camel and forwarded to the target system. For the case that the message delivery fails, there is an retry count defined in the Advanced Queue, so that the message delivery is repeated.p  pIf Camel now dequeue a message and sends it to a target system that is not available, either a HttpOperationFailedException or NoSuchEndpointException is thrown. These are caught and there is a rollback performed.p  pAt this point, the expectation is that the message delivery will be retried as often as defined in the Retry Count and then moved to an exception queue. However, what is happening is that the next message in the queue is send.p  pBecause the contents of the messages are partially dependent on each other, they must be processed sequentially.p  pI think that there is an misconfiguration in the usage of the JMS Library, but Im not sure and have found nothing I could influence this behavior.p  pThe used JMS library is Oracle AqApi v 11.2.0.3.p  pHere is the code for the Camel routep  precodefromjmscamelcomponentmyComponent.AQjmsMessageTypeText.routeIddeliveryToTarget         .transacted                         .setExchangePatternExchangePattern.InOut                                 .setHeaderExchange.HTTPQUERY, constantthrowExceptionOnFailurefalse         .setHeaderExchange.CONTENTTYPE, constantapplicationxml charsetUTF8         .doTry             .recipientListheaderendpointTarget             .endDoTry             .processResponseProzessor.getInstance             .logMessage was delivererd.         .doCatchHttpOperationFailedException.class, NoSuchEndpointException.class                 .processResponseProzessor.getInstance             .logError occured.             .rollback         .end codepre  pHere is the JmsComponent configurationp  precodeJmsComponent jmsComponent  new JmsComponentscc jmsComponent.setConnectionFactoryconnectionFactory jmsComponent.setTransactionManagertm jmsComponent.setMaxConcurrentConsumers1             jmsComponent.setMaxMessagesPerTask1                   jmsComponent.setIncludeSentJMSMessageIDtrue codepre  pThank you in advance for your help p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI think, Ive found the reason for the described behavior.

Positive 4069 pMessage driven beans are wonderful Java EE technology pieces that allow you to handle and process data concurrently, one message  one task  one thread. However sometimes there is need to keep the state of previous messages so that after collecting few or dozens of messages whole set of these messages might be processed together inside the single the same thread. The point is MDB after receiving message should avoid next steps, somehow informs that for example next 4 messages in the JMS queue should be saved somewhere, and after that after receiving 5th message these 5 messages should be used fo some calculation together. The question is what kind of technology should be used to handle this scenario Singleton bean IMDG for example JBOSS Cache, Infinispan What is the best practisep  pEDIT  Unfortunatelly almost always two JMS messages are handled by two different instances of Message Driven Bean and each instance of MDB uses different instance of any session bean stateful or stateless.p  precode    MessageDrivenactivationConfig  ...     public class SomeMDB implements MessageListener         EJB AnyService service      codepre  pIn that such of case, even if AnyService is a stateful bean, each message has its own instance of SomeMDB and instance of AnyService. Correct me if I am wrong.p
Positive 4069 pI am using Java EE JMS Queue. I am sending objects into the queue and then receive them with a MDB. When reading the message body with getBody into an object I get the following exceptionp  precodejavax.jms.MessageFormatException Body not assignable to class ... codepre  pThe object is quite big so its hard to spot where the actual problem could be. It comes from a REST endpoint. Is there any way to get a more descriptive error out of this that would tell why exactly it is not assignable I also tried to go into debug mode and see what kind of Message object arrives into the MDB but it is serialized as far as I can see so its not really useful.p

Negative 4069 pI have a process which has a notify method which receives as a parameter the base class of the message type. Id like to do different processing based on the derived type of message. Does this mean I need to add a method called process or something similar to the message type, and invoke it using polymorphism Is it better to add a notify for each specific message typep  pMore details The language is C. I thought notify would be a good idea here, so that I would only need one method to be notified of the various message types. The controller inherits from a listener class which specifies a pure vitual notifyMsgBaseClass method. I still like that idea, since I dont have to add a notify for each new message type. But in the controller code itself, I dont see any way to distinguish between the message type other than something like dynamic cast, or adding a message type to the message. p  pedit I think Im going to go with the Visitor pattern. It allows me to keep just one method for the notify, and I can avoid a switch statement in my code. A visitor interface will specify the various methods needed by the listener to process the various derived message types. This will require only one message to be added to the Message base class, a pure virtual acceptMyMessageTypeVisitor v.  The derived message classes will implement it using v.visitthisp  pI emthinkem this oughta work.p
Negative 4069 pPython is so dynamic that its not always clear whats going on in a large program, and looking at a tiny bit of source code does not  always help. To make matters worse, editors tend to have poor support for navigating to the definitions of tokens or import statements in a Python file.p  pOne way to compensate might be to write a special profiler that, instead of timing the program, would record the runtime types and paths of objects of the program and expose this data to the editor.p  pThis might be implemented with sys.settrace which sets a callback for each line of code and is how pdb is implemented, or by using the ast module and an import hook to instrument the code, or is there a better strategy How would you write something like this without making it impossibly slow, and without runnning afoul of extreme dynamism e.g side affects on property accessp

Negative 4069 blockquote   pstrongNotestrong Although my particular context is ObjectiveC, my question actually transcends programming language choice. Also, I tagged it as subjective since someone is bound to complain otherwise, but I personally think its almost entirely objective. Also, Im aware of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions376090nsdictionarywithorderedkeysthis related SO questiona, but since this was a bigger issue, I thought it better to make this a separate question. Please dont criticize the question without reading and understanding it fully. Thanksp blockquote  pMost of us are familiar with the a hrefhttpwww.itl.nist.govdiv897sqgdadsHTMLdictionary.html relnofollowstrongdictionarystrong abstract data typea that stores keyvalue associations, whether we call it a map, dictionary, associative array, hash, etc. depending on our language of choice. A simple definition of a dictionary can be summarized by three propertiesp  ol liValues are accessed by key as opposed to by index, like an array.li liEach key is associated with a value.li liEach key must be unique.li ol  pAny other properties are arguably conveniences or specializations for a particular purpose. For example, some languages especially scripting languages such as PHP and Python blur the line between dictionaries and arrays and do provide ordering for dictionaries. As useful as this can be, such additions are not a fundamental characteristics of a dictionary. In a pure sense, the actual implementation details of a dictionary are irrelevant.p  pFor my question, the most important observation is that strongthe order in which keys are enumerated is not definedstrong  a dictionary may provide keys in whatever order it finds most convenient, and it is up to the client to organize them as desired.p  pIve a hrefhttpdysart.cs.byu.eduCHDataStructuresinterface5Fc5Fh5Flockable5Fdictionary.html relnofollowcreated custom dictionariesa that impose specific key orderings, including emnatural sorted orderem based on object comparisons and eminsertion orderem. Its obvious to name the former some variant on strongSortedDictionarystrong which Ive actually already implemented, but the latter is more problematic. Ive seen a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavase6docsapijavautilLinkedHashMap.html relnofollowLinkedHashMapa and a hrefhttpcommons.apache.orgcollectionsapi3.1orgapachecommonscollectionsmapLinkedMap.html relnofollowLinkedMapa Java, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.specialized.ordereddictionary.aspx relnofollowOrderedDictionarya .NET, a hrefhttpcodeendeavor.comgsdocsnetguttersharkutilcollectionsOrderedDictionary.html relnofollowOrderedDictionarya Flash, a hrefhttpwww.python.orgdevpepspep0372 relnofollowOrderedDicta Python, and a hrefhttpcocoawithlove.com200812ordereddictionarysubclassingcocoa.html relnofollowOrderedDictionarya ObjectiveC. Some of these are more mature, some are more proofofconcept.p  pstrongLinkedHashMapstrong is named according to implementation in the tradition of Java collections  linked because it uses a doublylinked list to track insertion order, and hash because it subclasses HashMap. Besides the fact that user shouldnt need to worry about that, the class name doesnt really even indicate what it does. Using strongorderedstrong seems like the consensus among existing code, but web searches on this topic also revealed understandable confusion between ordered and sorted, and I feel the same. The .NET implementation even has a comment about the apparent misnomer, and suggests that it should be IndexedDictionary instead, owing to the fact that you can retrieve and insert objects at a specific point in the ordering.p  p

Negative 4069 pI have an Asp.net MVC partial view that is used for searching. It does an Ajax call to retrieve results. Once the results are retrieved and displayed in the result pane, the user can click on a link in any of the result rows to select one of the search results. When the user clicks on a link to select one of the search results, it will make an Ajax post request to update some state. Once this Ajax call is complete, I need to redirect to another page, but the destination page depends on which page the user is on. This search partial view will be hosted in multiple pages and the redirect location will be different for each of the host pages. I cannot think of a way to do this that makes sense and doesnt couple the partial view to the hosting page or vice versa excessively. p  pI guess the other option might be to redirect to another page once the selection Ajax call is complete this is ultimately the goal, but wont a redirect result within an Ajax call get swallowedp  pOr is there a way to have a button or link on each row instead that causes a post request to occur that could return a redirect result, with the destination based on the calling pagep
Negative 4069 pIm mostly new to Visual Studio, so I apologize if this is a basic problem.  I have a solution which contains a number of projects.  In project A, I have a preexisting set of files that I added a new class to.  Project B uses the functionality coded in that new class in Project A.  Project A is built first, and a .lib file is generated, and that .lib file is linked into Project B.  However, when I go to create the .lib file for Project B I get a link error, referencing the new functionality in Project A that I added.  Using dumpbin command with the .lib file generated from Project A, I notice that the symbols for the functions that I added arent there.  However, the .obj file created after compiling the new class in Project A does contains those symbols.  Any idea why those symbols arent then present in Project As .lib filep

Negative 4069 pToday I have a WCF question, though it probably pertains to other Networking models in .NET as well.p  pI have a WCF service that exposes a SendMessage OperationContract, which is OneWay  true.

Negative 4069 pIm trying to design a simple cache that follows the following rulesp  ol liEntries have a unique keyli liWhen the number of entries in the cache exceeds a certain limit, the older items are evicted to keep the cache from getting too large.li liEach entrys data is immutable until the entry is removed from the cache.li liA reader can access an entry in the cache and the entry must be valid for the lifetime of the reader.li liEach reader can be on its own thread, and all readers access the same cache instance.li ol  pThread safety with this cache is important, since we dont want readers holding a reference to an entry, only to have it evicted by another thread somewhere else.p  pHence, my current implementation just copies out the whole entry when reading from the cache. This is fine for smaller objects, but once objects get too large theres too much copying going on. Its also not so great with large numbers of readers that are accessing the same cached entry.p  pSince the data is immutable, it would be great if every reader to the same message could just hold a reference instead of a copy, but in some thread safe manner so it wouldnt get evicted.p  pA previous implementation used reference counting to achieve this...but its very tricky with threads, and I went with this simpler approach.p  pAre there any other patternsideas I could use to improve this designp

This schema can also be modified at any time. This application will be installed at the customer location, and will need to function even when they change their field structure.p  pIn order to insert or update a record, I first call their Project.GetSchema method, which returns the XSD file based on the current set of fields, and then I can call the Project.AddProject method, passing in an XML file containing the project data.p  pstrongMy question isstrong Whats the best way to generate the XML from the XSD file at runtime I need to be able to check for the existence of fields, and fill them out only if they exist for instance, if the customer deleted or renamed some fields. p  pI really dont want to have the application attempting to recompile classes on the fly using xsd.exe.

Negative 4069 pWe have two websites for the same client main www site and another for the ecommerce site which sits on a seperate server that use shared portion of code various featuresstylesjavascript etc.. We currently manage this by having the shared code as seperate projects in the same repos in SVN and using svnexternals to pull the branch of each of these into the two website projects.p  pWe have just created two release branches, one each for the two sites. Everything gets commited to trunk for each of the sites as normal when working and when ready for live we merge it into the release branch for that site. Works a treat except today we modified the some of the shared code and noticed that the release branch pulled it in straight away when we did an update on the release branch. This is not what we wanted p  pSo any ideas how we can iron out this problem. We used externals to DRY up the sharing of the code but is there another way Notice that in this question httpstackoverflow.comquestions245337howcanibranchinsvnandhaveitbranchmysvnexternalfoldersaswell they mention externals are bad and we should be using a different build process but no mention of what that should be.p  pWe have CruiseControl.net running our builds and are keen to get this nut cracked. Has anyone any ideas on a better processp  pCheersp  pPetep  pUPDATE Weve since moved to using Mercurial Fogcreeks Kiln for our source control. Mercurial also has the idea of subrepos so we followed that route with our project there too. However it comes at a cost, branching is made really difficult as is tagging and simply keeping everything up to date. Our latest method is to bring both projects into one repos including all the shared repos too. This gives us one mega project which slows clone time check out in SVN but we do that so rarely that the gains of not having to deal with subrepos makes it well worth while. We now use feature switchingtoggling rather than branching which also simplifies our development greatly.p

Negative 4069 pIn my company we have developped some applications. We have to create an API for one application say application A, so that the others can use it an its data.p  pThe question is  we already have developped PHP classes for the model of Application A, if we want to create an API, should we br  reuse these classes too much functionnalities for an API, too heavy...br  create one PHP class, with some basic functions, that takes in input and returns only raw values like strings, array... NOT complex classesbr  create another set of PHP classes, simpler, and designed only to be used by an external application so only to get data easilyp  pUsually, an API is the 2nd solution to be used as well with PHP than as a web service for example, but i find it too bad that we made a complex and usefull class modelisation, then we tear it apart just to have functions, strings and array. The 3rd one seems to me to be the compromise, but a collegue of mine insist that this is not an API. Too bad...p  pWhat do you think p

Negative 4069 pLets say I have these kind of requirementsp  pUser A in Role AA needs to be able to update all entities of type A1.p  pUser B in Role BB needs to be able to update only the entities of type A1 with the primary identifier of 2, which Ill call A12, and can not update any other entities of type A1, but can add or delete any number of child entities of type B2 to entity A12.p  pUser C in Role CC needs to be able to edit most but not all of the properties of these children B2 entities belonging to entity A12, nor can members of Role CC add or remove B2 entities from A12.p  pUser D is in Role BB and Role CC, and as a result of the combined memberships, has the permissions derived from a union of the two sets of permissions in this case, because Role CC permissions are a proper subset of Role BB, this means User D can do everything allowed for Role BB.p  pAnd so on.

Negative 4069 pI have an application that stores database IDs in session while editing several pages of data. When the user opens multiple tabs or windows, data is being overwritten because the IDs are getting crossed up. I completely understand the problem, and was going to fix this by taking the IDs out of storage and passing them around in query string however, I thought URL routing might be a better solution. For example, I could have a URL of ...Invoice123.p  pMy biggest concern is that there are multiple IDs I need at one time. For example, an invoice might have a list of line items, so Id have to use a URL with ...Invoice123LineItem456.

Negative 4069 pI keep making attempts at properly using HTML5 but I feel like its still not even close to anything semantically valuable.p  pMy attemptsp  ul lia hrefhttpgist.github.com546669 relnofollowHTML5 Article node Architectureali lia hrefhttpviatropos.combloghtml5blogpostarchitecture relnofollowHTML5 Blog Page Architectureali ul  pBut theres such subtleties in every single tagp  pMy question is, what specific software emout there on the webem is actually doing things like processing our HTML DOM, calculating and comparing elements to say oh, this is a codeltheadergtcode, and its just after codeltsectiongtcode, and it has codelttimegtcode in it, so the codelttimegtcode tag must be metadata in relation to the codeltheadergtcode..., and saying The content within the codelttimegtcode tag not only is the published time, but also relates to the authors birthday, so it must be a special post say because there was also a codeltcitegtcode or codeltaddress classvcardgtcode tag in there too.p  pI mean, what benefit am I ever going to get in using HTML5 if I dont know the algorithms that are interpreting it  If I just stuck with the basic codediv, ol, ul, li, p, a, h[16]code tags, I could do everything with half the number of DOM elements.p  pLooking forward to some specific algorithms that I can use to shape how I structure the DOM from here on out.p  pIm at the point where I dont even think we should be using HTML5 tags at all.  For example, on the iPhone especially, the goal should be to minimize dom elements to decrease load time.  Plus, if the iPhone site is a mirror of the traditional browser version, the search engines wont even see the iPhone site ideally.  So theres no real point in making the DOM semantic.  So if I can use 12 the amount of codeltdivgtcode tags to achieve the same layout as if I used a somewhat semantic HTML5 rendition, and thats a good thing for the iPhone, why dont I do that for the regular browser too  Thats where Im coming from.p  pArticles like a hrefhttpwww.searchenginejournal.comhowmuchdoessemantichtmlstructurematterforseo7991 relnofollowthisa are basically saying its pointless to worry about semantic HTML.p

Why is this happening edit tommieb75 I cant give much detail, the results do not seem to have a pattern. The list is used as a generalized way to draw stuff to the screen, and having the function instead of the direct setting makes odd problems in rendering and random, but produce no compiler errors at all. gdb shows some integers as being larger than an integer, thats the only pattern I find. masterlist is a global array of another struct. The data needs to be converted to the struct in this example. No compiler warnings or errors at all. I can turn in more sensitive warnings maybe, but I always get reported of any general error I can think. I am going to try the selected solution, that should suffice. Anyway similar functions returning structs are used in my code and all work perfectly except for this case with an array of structs.p

I really need to get it into the slider and working.p  pHeres an example of my script that creates the two chartsp  precodegoogle.loadvisualization, 1, packages[geomap, corechart]   Set a callback to run when the API is loaded. google.setOnLoadCallbackdrawExistMap google.setOnLoadCallbackdrawTrussChart   Callback that creates and populates a data table function drawExistMap  var data  new google.visualization.DataTable  do a bunch of stuff here to populate the table and create the chart  Create the table visualization object and call the draw method on it. var container  document.getElementByIdexistMap var geomap  new google.visualization.GeoMapcontainer geomap.drawdata, options    drawTrussChart creates pie chart showing truss types of returned bridges function drawTrussChart  do more stuff similar to the above ...... var chart  new google.visualization.PieChartdocument.getElementByIdTTChartdiv chart.drawdata, options   The slider on my page looks like lt AnythingSlider 1 gt ltul idslider1gt     ltligtltdiv idexistMapgtltdivgtltligt     ltligtltdiv idTTChartdivgtltdivgtltligt ltulgt codepre  pAgain, if I move div TTChartdiv out of the slider and put it elsewhere on the page, the chart displays just fine.p  pIve tried placing other content in the last slide theres actually four slides, not just these two.  If its an image or text or something like that, it shows up in that slide.  but if its the chart.. it wont go.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong  Ive experimented wthis a bit and thrown as many as 3 charts into the slider.  Its ONLY when a chart div is in the LAST tab li tag that it doesnt display.  So, lets say I have 5 tabsslides and I place the 3 charts in the middle three tabs, they all display  But if one of those charts is in the last tab, it doesnt show up.  Unfortunately, my needs are that this stupid thing is in the last slide so now Im not sure what I can do.p

Negative 4069 pI was trying to solve this issue recently, but i dont really know how. I have an application that allows users to register and create profilesas many as they want. For every profile they can create campaignsas many as they want per profile and for each campaign they can add linksthere is a limited number for the links but its big anyway. Each link can have its own keywords more than 1 keyword. p  pThe obvious thing that came to my mind was to have a table for users, one for profiles, one for campaigns, one for links and one for keywords. But think of this, some users may use the same keywords and i dont want to repeat that information over the database n times. I dont know if this is possible in mysql but i would like to have a field in the links table which will refer to the ids of the keywords in the keywords table. something like an array of ids. I would like this implementation to be flexible, allowing me to easily retrieve the keywords, update the array of keywords and perform certain computations count the number of keywords for example. Can you recommend a possible solution on how to implement thisp  pJust to state again Im using mySQL and php. Thank you.p

Negative 4069 pIs there any nice way to configure a ListBox WinForms so that it is possible to select multiple items by clickdrag, or by shiftclick, but that only a consecutive range of items can be selected  Essentially, Id like to make the selection behavior of the ListBox be from a user perspective rather like that of a TextBox, but with the restriction that only entire lines may be selected.p  pRight now Im using a UserDrawVariable ListBox as an event log, but the scrolling behavior of the UserDrawVariable Listbox is somewhat wonky.  Id like to change it to a UserDrawFixed ListBox, using multiple items for things which are supposed to be taller have an ItemExtension type for later items which would hold a reference to the first item, which would expose its draw routine to them.  The only way I can think of to have the selection behavior work reasonably, though, would be to track the beginning and end of the selection range, and draw as highlighted any items which are at least partially selected.  Using individual item selection flags would seem wonky if a user clicks on the top half of a twopart item and then controlclicks the bottom half clicking either half should highlight the item, and the controlclick should unhighlight it, but since the clicks would be registered on separate items I dont think that would happen.p  pPerhaps ListBox really isnt the right control.  Id be open to suggestions for some better opensource control with an unrestricted license I cant opensource my application.p

Negative 4069 pI am making a music player for fun, and have run into a issue thinking about how to structure the data. My first thought was a tree structure where Genre was the root and each genre holds a list of artists, each artist holds a list of albums, each album holds a list of song titles. The problem with this is that albums get split up because some songs on an album have a genre of rock and another song on the same album might have a genre called metal.p  pAny thoughts on a better approachp

Negative 4069 pI work in a safetycritical industry, and our software projects generally have safety requirements imposed things that we have to demonstrate that the software does to a high degree of certainty.  Often these are negatives, such as  shall not corrupt  more frequently than 1 in .  I should add that these requirements come from statistical system safety requirements.p  pOne source of corruption is clearly coding errors, and I would like to use the Haskell type system to exclude at least some classes of these errors.  Something like thisp  pFirst, here is our critical data item that must not be corrupted.p  precodenewtype Critical  Critical String codepre  pNow I want to store this item in some other structures.p  precodedata Foo  Foo Integer Critical data Bar  Bar String Critical codepre  pNow I want to write a conversion function from Foo to Bar which is guaranteed not to mess with the Critical data.p  precodegoodConvert, badConvert  Foo gt Bar  goodConvert Foo n c  Bar show n c  badConvert Foo n Critical s  Bar show n Critical  Bzzt    s codepre  pI want goodConvert to type check, but badConvert to fail type checking.p  pObviously I can carefully not import the Critical constructor into the module that does conversion.  But it would be much better if I could express this property in the type, because then I can compose up functions that are guaranteed to preserve this property.p  pIve tried adding phantom types and forall in various places, but that doesnt help.p  pOne thing that would work would be to not export the Critical constructor, and then havep  precodemkCritical  String gt IO Critical codepre  pSince the only place that these Critical data items get created is in the input functions, this makes some sense.  But Id prefer a more elegant and general solution.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pIn the comments FUZxxl suggested a look at a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgtracghcwikiSafeHaskellSafe Haskella.  This looks like the best solution.  Rather than adding a no corruption modifier at the type level as I originally wanted, it looks like you can do it at the module level, like thisp  p1 Create a module Critical that exports all the features of the Critical data type, including its constructor.  Mark this module as unsafe by putting  LANGUAGE Unsafe  in the header.p  p2 Create a module SafeCritical that reexports everything except the constructor and any other functions that might be used to corrupt a critical value.  Mark this module as trustworthy.p  p3 Mark any modules that are required to handle Critical values without corruption as safe.  Then use this to demonstrate that any function imported as safe cannot cause corruption to a Critical value.p  pThis will leave a smaller minority of code, such as input code that parses Critical values, requiring further verification.  We cant eliminate this code, but reducing the amount that needs detailed verification is still a significant win.p  pThe method is based on the fact that a function cannot invent a new value unless a function returns it.  If a function only gets one Critical value as in the convert function above then that is the only one it can return.p  pA harder variation of the problem comes when a function has two or more Critical values of the same type it has to guarantee not to mix them up.  For instance,p  precodeswapFooBar  Foo, Bar gt Bar, Foo swapFooBar Foo n c1, Bar s c2  Bar s c1, Foo n c2 codepre  pHowever this can be handled by giving the same treatment to the containing data structures.p

There are several reasons why this is useful, the most important I think are p  ul liA small device may seem large enough for a usual old school web page to not break its layouts meant for desktop screens.li liIt is used to get the HTML render engine render more than the currently visible part of the page, thus enabling smooth scrolling and zooming.li ul  pHowever, this breaks several standardized behavour expectations I think.p  ul liIn particular, the page is not aware of its visible area, thus JS powered things like popups or notifications dont work correctly anymore. li liIt seems to break ondemand loading of embedded ressources like thumbnails, video objects, endless lists if the user move the element into view.li liIt also introduces erratic behavour with layout adpating JS, for example onresize Handlers adpating the pages layout could easily change the pages size, thus resizing the viewport maybe even repeat triggering the onresize event.li ul  pShould I consider this as yetbrokenbutsomedayfixed behavour and stick to small workarounds in every broken page, or should I drop any expectaions on onresize, window.innerWidth etc. and go back to more static layouts not relying on the idea of a viewport anymorep

Negative 4069 pI am using an iOS 5 storyboardbased project. When presenting a modal view controller I have selected to use the horizontal flip transition. During the transition the background is black, which is not particularly aesthetic given the design of my app. How can I change the background colour during the transitionp  pOn nonstoryboard projects I was able to change the background colour of the MainWindow.xib, but since this file is no longer present in storyboard projects this cannot be done. Additionally, as the entry point of the storyboard is a UINavigationController there doesnt seem to be any property for a background colour I doubt that would make a difference anyway, since the background colour I need to change is associated with the window and not the main view controller, since that view controller is essentially being flipped to display the modal view controller.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4069 pIm facing a requirement to create a static method on my base class,  but dont like that I have to declare type arguments, so Im wondering if Im going about this the right way.p  pBasically, Im assigning delegates that Ill associate with properties on the class.  I could easily put the method on the inherited classes, like sop  precodepublic class Foo      public string Property1  get set    public class InheritsFoo  Foo       public void AssignDelltTValgt         ExpressionltFuncltInheritsFoo, TValgtgt expr,          ActionltInheritsFoo, TValgt action             codepre  pOr, in an extension class, I could do thisp  precodepublic static void AssignDelltT, TValgt     this T source,      ExpressionltT, TValgtgt expression,      ActionltT, TValgt action      where T  Foo    codepre  pBoth of these would enable me to use codeAssignDelcode in an instantiated classp  precodevar foo  new InheritsFoo foo.AssignDelx gt x.Property1, handler codepre  pBut I have a requirement to make codeAssignDelcode static. This makes the extension way of doing it useless. It still works in codeInheritsFoocode, but I really want to move this to the base class. If I try, the generics argument cant be inferred, and I have to change the usage of the methodp  precodeInheritsFoo.AssignDelltInheritsFoo, stringgtx gt x.Property1, handler codepre  pIs there a way out here, another way of doing this I havent thought ofp  pEDIT to address the issue in the comments about whether or not the extension method wouldshould work... I went to the url referenced by Mark M.  Turns out that if I write it as such...p  precodeInheritsFoo foo  null foo.AssignDelx gt x.Property1, handler codepre  pThat compiles dont know if it will run, though.  Still, dont think that qualifies as using a static method, since foo is still considered an instance  A null instance, but an instance nonetheless.p

Negative 4069 pIve seen from some sources that although you can make an exe or mac equivalent app using py2exe or py2app, you can only make the one your system is. Makes sense when I think about it. p  pBut my problem is sometimes I want to write python scripts and send them to my Windowsusing friends to test and play with. But Windows doesnt come with python installed, and I dont want to make them have to install Python. p  pIs there any way to use a MAC to create a pythonmade file that can be opened without python or any installation ON WINDOWSp  pIf theres not I suppose I could try using the emulated Windows on my system to make it an exe, but Id rather not boot that every time I need to change something.p

Negative 4069 pI am opening a directory with opendir which returns dir  and want to keep and reuse the dir constantly in my object.  I had originaly opened the directory in my constructor and stored the pointer as a private variable, this obviously failed since as soon as the constructor ended the pointer was out of scope and the memory freed.p  pMy question is, how do I keep the directory reference so that my class can keep using it over and over without reopening it each time  Ive tried copying it to a DIR type, but I get a complaint that DIR is not fully defined.  I doubt even if I could figure out where DIR is defined it will have a copy constructor anyways.  There must be another way to keep it in scopep

Negative 4069 pDoes anyone know how if the HDR logic is in the camera application or in the camera driver for android phones   For example on the samsung galaxy you can enable HDR mode on the default camera app to get greater dynamic range captured on your photos.  Is that done by the camera app, or done by the camera driverAPIp  pFor example can I write a camera app that can capture in HDR mode as well   I noticed in the camera settings if you flatten the settings that there is a hidden setting called hdrmode.  I tried to set this but when i took a picture it reported an error.p  pAlternatively, is there a way to capture a burst of photos very rapidly each with a different exposure value so HDR can be postprocessed  I also saw a hidden setting something like picturespershutter that appears to allow burst capture.   But it dooesnt seem to have a way to do exposure bracketing as would be necessary to process HDR.p  pLets say for this example if this is dependent on specific phone that we are working with a Galaxy S3.p

Negative 4069 pRecently I had a problem when I upload an app, the App Uploader told me I used a private property called contentId which is a private property in Core Data managed object, what I did is to create a protocol that has a contentId property and make one of my core data managed object subclass implements that protocol, and in the getter of contentId it returns its object id, I dont know if I use contentId directly in managed object subclass, whether or not it warns me at that time, but I wonder is there a way to make sure my classes do not use private properties, before trying to upload and let the app uploader tells me, as sometimes it is not possible to make change at the final step. Thanksp

Negative 4069 pIm working on a Bison file for a mathematical expression parser. Up to now its mostly fine, but Im facing a problem with implicit multiplications.p  pYou see, Id like to support expressions like code2x sin4x cos4xcode. It should parse like code2  x  sin4  x  cos4  xcode. Nothing too bad here, but consider the following set of rulesp  precodeexpr       snip        expr        negate expression        expr  expr   subtract expressions        expr expr       multiply expressions   codepre  pHaving that implicit multiplication rule creates an ambiguity with the subtraction rule is codex  logxcode the subtraction of codelogxcode to codexcode or the multiplication of codexcode by codelogxcodep  pId be ready to settle for an easy solution, like its a multiplication unless its subtracting, but I dont know how to tell that to Bison.p
Negative 4069 pIm really at a loss as to how this happened. I have an app that uses ARC. Most of the my view controllers register for NSNotifications. All registrations are done on the main thread.p  pWhen a memory warning occurs, the navigation controller used for each nonvisible tab is nild and is consequently deallocated. In this case, one navigation controller and its view controller were deallocated, and the view controller crashed the app during its dealloc method.p  pSpecifically, it was removing itself from all NSNotificationCenter notifications.p  pThe dealloc method also ran in the main thread, so I dont see how this could be a threading issue.p  pThe crashed line is code[SearchTabViewController dealloc] SearchTabViewController.m44codep  pThat line in the code is code[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserverself]codep  pThe actual crash reason appears to be codeobjcmsgSendcode referencing a deallocated object. p  pThe problem with that is that there are only 2 messages being sent here, the codedefaultCentercode message to the codeNSNotificationCentercode class which can never be an invalid reference because its a class and the coderemoveObservercode message to the default center object also can never be deallocated because its a singleton. p  pThe only other object referenced is self, which cant be deallocated yet because were still in the dealloc method for that object... Basically this crash shouldnt have happened.p  pIs there something Im missing here Relevant part of the crash log belowp  hr  precodeException Type  SIGSEGV Exception Codes SEGVACCERR at 0xe0000008 Crashed Thread  0  Thread 0 Crashed 0   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x000035b0 objcmsgSend  16 1   Anghami Beta                        0x000c7473 [SearchTabViewController dealloc] SearchTabViewController.m44 2   CoreFoundation                      0x00003311 CFRelease  101 3   CoreFoundation                      0x0000d95d [NSArrayM dealloc]  141 4   Anghami Beta                        0x0033e73f [EX2NavigationController .cxxdestruct] EX2NavigationController.m51 5   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x00007f3d objectcxxDestructFromClassobjcobject, objcclass  57 6   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x000050d3 objcdestructInstance  35 7   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x000053a7 objectdispose  15 8   UIKit                               0x000cec89 [UIViewController dealloc]  1181 9   CoreFoundation                      0x00003311 CFRelease  101 10  CoreFoundation                      0x0000da13 [NSArrayI dealloc]  79 11  libobjc.A.dylib                     0x00005489 anonymous namespaceAutoreleasePoolPagepopvoid  169 12  CoreFoundation                      0x00005441 CFAutoreleasePoolPop  17 13  CoreFoundation                      0x00095f41 CFRunLoopRun  1297 14  CoreFoundation                      0x00008ebd CFRunLoopRunSpecific  357 15  CoreFoundation                      0x00008d49 CFRunLoopRunInMode  105 16  GraphicsServices                    0x000052eb GSEventRunModal  75 17  UIKit                               0x00057301 UIApplicationMain  1121 18  Anghami Beta                        0x0000334d main main.m17 codepre

Negative 4069 pDoes linuxUbuntu OS creates a table, which keeps the entry of every file with its absolute address that is stored on the hard drivep  pJust curious to know, because I am planning to make a file searcher program.p  pI know there are terminal commands like find etc, but as I will program in C I was thinking if there any such thing Ubuntu OS does, if so, how can I access that tablep  pUpdatep  pAs some people mentioned there is no such thing, then If I want to make a file searcher program, I would have to search each and every folder of every directory, starting program root directory. The resultant program will be very sluggish and will perform poorly So is there a better way Or my way is goodp

Negative 4069 pWorking on my first Web Pages project using C and Webmatrix. So for thing have been going pretty well but have now run into an issue that has me stumped. What I am doing is posting a form to this page which contains a message and I am then saving the message to the DB and will later also get the email part going. p  pIve posted the code below, its actually longer than need be to illustrate the problem but thought Id post it all nonetheless. WebMatrix was already highlighting an issue at hand before I tried running it when I saw that the penultimate closing curly brackets was highlighted yellow. When running the code and the post values are all OK I get the error CS1513  expected. I initially thought I had by mistake added an extra closing curly bracket, but after checking and double checking and then slowly rebuilding up the code line by line to identify after which line it started going wrong, I have now come to the conclusion that without any of the nested if and foreach statements within the ifIsPost ampamp WebSecurity.IsAuthenticated if statement that it then works although obviously not with the desired logic.p  pIve checked around and Ive found plenty of C code examples where this is done.

Negative 4069 pIm very amateur when it comes to OOP, self taught using python.p  pMy main concern is that of breaking concepts or entities into objects.p  pFor instance, I have just written some code that controls a traffic light system attached to my raspberry pi. p  pThe system contains p  ul liA car set off traffic lights red, yellow, green. li liA button to request a crossing.li liAnd a green and red light to tell pedestrians when to crossli ul  pNow i ended up modelling my code as one entire class. Where methods inside the object call other methods in the object. E.g. when the object is initialized, the initialize method calls a wait for button press method, when the button press is detected that method then calls a run through light sequence method.p  pIs this bad practice Should each conceptentity be a separate classobject, e.g. traffic light object, button object, pedestrian light objectp  pSorry for the openness of the question.p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 4069 pIve come to a point in my development where its about time I test the app on an actual device and so I a trying to do that on my old HTC Hero.p  pIve followed the instructions on the developers website for android at this link a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicsfirstapprunningapp.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicsfirstapprunningapp.htmla  and everytime I go to Run the app it tells me there is No active compatible AVDs or devices found. Relaunch this configuration after connecting a device or starting an AVD.p  pWhen I look at the setup of the app its configured for Android 2.1 api 7 and the HTC Hero is Android 2.1 update1. I have gone into settingsApplicationsDevelopment on the phone and set it to allow debugging through USB.p  pTherefore I am really struggling to find out how to fix this.p
Negative 4069 pI have an java script array created as p  precodevar ar  new Array ar[0]  foo ar[1]  bar codepre  pI need to know what is best way to post it to server using ajax jquery Do i need to serialize it before postp

Negative 4069 pIve set up a system with a TaskExecutor and Taskscheduler that runs tasks on a cronlike schedule, but also allows tasks to be started on demand.p  pOne particular problem I havent been able to solve how can I get information from the executor and scheduler as to which specific task is running right now. Is there a standard way to do this Should I be looking at a specific subclass or implementation We are on Spring 3.2 and I tried ThreadPoolTaskExecutor but found it was deprecated. It did have one method getActiveCount that seemed to go some way towards what I wanted to achieve though not entirely at all.p  pRight now, Ive put in place a system that takes a snapshot of an ORM object state, waits half a minute and takes another snapshot.

Negative 4069 pI want to have an app where a user typically a power user can enter a boolean expression. I want to be able to execute the boolean expression in both .NET and in SQL. p  pThe expressions themselves arent that hard, they are things like p  ul licountry is united statesli licountry is one of united states, canada, mexicoli licountry is united states AND age is 20li licountry is united states OR age is 20 and country is one of united states, canadali ul  pI need to be able to support basic things like in, equals, greaterless than, between, contains, startswith, etc. I want to be able to compile into C and run it against an object of type codedynamiccode, and also be able to compile the expression into SQL. I would be plugging the result into a where clause of a very specific query. p  pI do not want to use Nhibernate or EntityFramework, I want to be able to execute the SQL directly. p  pstrongUPDATEstrong  I already know that I want to execute it using ADO.NET. Sorry if I didnt state it clearly. I just want to know what a good approach would be to store a boolean expression that can be executed both in C and SQL. I dont care about stored procedures and parameterization the latter is obvious and trivial once Im able to generate a query. The users entering the expressions are internal to my company, mostly developers and power users. p  pSo Im thinking along the lines of using things like Expression Trees, Abstract Syntax Trees, LINQ, etc, to accomplish this. I dont want to use an ORM, but I want to do something very similar to what the ORMs do in their LINQ expressions to convert lambas into the code for the codeWHEREcode clause. p  pstrongUPDATE2strong  The way were thinking of doing this so far is having the expressions entered as C and stored as strings in a database. When we want to execute in a .NET context wed compile into a lambda or Expression and maybe wrape it in an object that as an interface with a method to represent the boolean expression codeinterface IDynamicFilter  bool PassesFilterltSomePocoTypegtpoco code. Or we could drop the POCOs into an IEnumerable and run a LINQ .Where with the lambdaexpression passed in to pull out the objects that match the filters. p  pFor the SQL, this is the part Im more fuzzy on. We want to replicate what the ORMs do  visit an Expresssion tree and render it into an SQL string. We dont need to support the full set of SQL. We only have to support pretty simple operators like grouping with parentheses, ANDORNOT, innot in, GTLTEQNEQbetween. We also want to support some basic maths operations codea  b gt ccode. p

Negative 4069 pWe have a VM in a VMWare cluster running Jenkins 1.477, 1.480.3, and 1.508 to do builds for commits to our SVN repository Collabnet SVN 1.7.53150.92.  The repository is accessed via an SSL connection.  For security reasons neither computer the build server or the SVN server have access to the internet.  When a Jenkins build begins the start of the SVN update the console for the job pauses on Updating a hrefhttpsvcfs01.redactedaddress.comsvnMTCMTrunk relnofollowhttpsvcfs01.redactedaddress.comsvnMTCMTrunka for 30  90 seconds.  Once the update begins it is fairly fast.p  pTo rule Jenkins out as the culprit, I reproduced the same issue by doing a checkout from the build server using TortoiseSVN.  The same delay occurs with Tortoise, and once files begin to transfer the transfer rate ranges from 50  70 KBs which is great.  p  pWe use Kaspersky, and have ruled it out as an issue, because the problem does not occur on programmers PCs that have Kaspersky.  We also tried excluding both servers just to be 100 sure.  p  pFor awhile I was convinced this was an issue with certificate revocation checking because I saw with WireShark an attempted HTTP GET from a hrefhttpctldl.windowsupdate.commsdownloadupdatev3statictrustedrendisallowedcertstl.cabdca976bb02bdc2e3 relnofollowhttpctldl.windowsupdate.commsdownloadupdatev3statictrustedrendisallowedcertstl.cabdca976bb02bdc2e3a .  Using the steps in a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb2677070 relnofollowthis KB articlea I disabled certificate revocation checks on both the the Jenkins server and the SVN server though I doubt the latter mattered.  Once I made this change I no longer so attempted connections to the windowsupdate server but instead saw an HTTP GET from a hrefhttpcrl.globalsign.comgsgsorganizationvalg2.crl relnofollowhttpcrl.globalsign.comgsgsorganizationvalg2.crla .   I stumbled across a hrefhttpwww.pagehouse.comblog200904howtodisablecrlchecking.html relnofollowthis article on disabling CRL checkinga.  I followed the steps there for both server and no longer see HTTP GETs to foreign internet addresses.  p  pWhen the Jenkins server has access to the internet the handshake takes 5 seconds in Tortoise as opposed to 90 seconds when the firewall prevents access.  Despite the fast handshake for Tortoise the speed for Jenkins is the same as when the firewall was in place  p  pI did some research on Jenkins I also updated Jenkins from version 1.477 to 1.508 and found a hrefhttpwiki.svnkit.comSVNKitFAQQI.27mencounteringperformanceissuesrefreshingaworkingcopyaccessedthroughasymboliclink. relnofollowan article about SVNKit having problems with symbolic linksa.  As far as I can tell, no symbolic links are being used.p  pWhat I am seeing with WireShark is that there is some initial activity creation of an encrypted connection between the Jenkins server and SVN server.  After the initial activity 30 seconds passes and then there is more activity application data is sent.  After the application data there is another 30 second delay, and then more application data is sent, the encrypted connection is reset, and the update begins. p  pI talked to the networking group about what Chris and Barmar wrote and the networking group saidp  blockquote   pOur DNS servers already have a reverse 168.192 look up zone and it is populated with   quite a few servers.

Negative 4069 pI have a ton of scripts I need to execute, each on a separate machine. Im trying to use Jenkins to do this. I have a Python script that can execute a single test and handles time limits and collection of test results, and a handful of Jenkins jobs that run this Python script with different args. When I run this script from the command line, it works fine. But when I run the script via Jenkins with the exact same arguments the test times out. The script handles killing the test, so control is returned all the way back to Jenkins and everything is cleaned up. How can I debug this The Python script is using subprocess.popen to launch the test.p  pAs a side note, Im open to suggestions for how to do this better, with or without Jenkins and my Python script.

Negative 4069 pIn the OS X OpenCL CPU runtime, the documentation a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationPerformanceConceptualOpenCLMacProgGuidePerformancePerformance.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40008312CH113SW7 relnofollowherea indicates that Work items are scheduled in different tasks submitted to Grand Central Dispatch.  That would seem to indicate that workgroups are essentially a noop, and you should shoot for number of work items  number of hardware threads with number of workgroups being irrelevant.  However, on other implementations, there are lowcost switches between items in the same workgroup via essentially coroutines setjmp and longjmp, which would make it much less expensive to schedule more workitems since you avoid a full OSmanaged thread context switch between items, which in turn would make it easier to reuse code between CPU and GPU targets.  According to Heterogeneous Computing with OpenCL, AMDs CPU runtime does this, and I vaguely recall some documentation indicating the same is true for Intels CPU runtime.p  pCan anyone confirm the behavior of workgroups in the OS X CPU runtimep

I call all three panels in a main method call.p  precode MyObject1 mo1  new MyObject1  contains a textfield and a button  MyObject2 mo2  new MyObject2  contains a textarea holding a long paragraph  MyObject3 mo3  new MyObject3 codepre  pHow can I get mo1 to call methods on mo2 changing the text of the text areap  pThanks for all the suggestions guys I am gonna go ahead and accept the first answer. It solved my problem.p  pstrongUpdatestrong One of these panels was a combination of another two panels in my program, which was hindering my ability to pass an instance of an object to a certain class.

Negative 4069 pTrying to implement a system whereby a developer would create a cshtml Razor view as per usual e.g. a series of Html.EditorFortt.MyProperty calls interspersed with markup etc. but based on certain headers coming through in the request to differ the response.p  pAs an examplep  pStandard user navigates to the action by typing the route into a browser, gets the standard, expected HTML result.p  pNonhuman system visits the same URL as the user, but includes an HTTP header to identify itself, gets a custom output.  Custom output in this case is JSON representation of the fields defined with the EditorFor calls.p  pIve gotten reasonably far with this by just creating a new helper called CustomEditorFor that dumps out the JSON if hte headers present or defers to HtmlHelper.EditorFor if its not, but that gives me some limitations  I need each of the fields to be comma separated and wrapped up as a JSON collection but the info available to the helper doesnt appear to give me any context of whether its firstlast etc. in the view.p  pIm looking into where I need to override to do this relatively cleanly.  So far its looking like Ill need a custom implementation of IView or more likely subclassing RazorView and a custom implementation of a ViewEngine were already subclassing RazorViewEngine to handle paths etc. so thats not a problem and its looking like, to get the absolute ideal result, I may also need to create a subclass of either WebViewPage or WebPageBase to be able to affect whats shown or not shown to the response etc.p  pI do have a couple of limitations herep  ol liI cant use a separate view file for thisli liI cant put the bits for the JSON in the view file because of 1.  It needs to render to HTML properly by default and only to JSON where the correct headers are presentli ol  pHas anyone done anything along these lines  Am I on the right path  Is there a simpler way to do this  Feels incredibly overengineered but I cant see any other way to do this cleanly at the moment.p

Negative 4069 pIm currently working on building a simple CMS, and I want to rewrite specific slugs like setup, and admin to their respective pages, while allowing the htaccess to rewrite all the rest of the requests to my serving page.p  pHere is what I have in my .htaccess right nowp  precodeOptions FollowSymlinks MultiViews RewriteEngine on RewriteBase    Rewrite the setup slug to the setup page RewriteCond REQUESTURI setup RewriteRule setup setup.php [L,R301]   Rewrite all other URLs to the keyhole that translates them RewriteRule . keyhole.phpslug1 [L,QSA] codepre  pCurrently, the redirect works for all other URLs. It captures each of them and then sends them on to keyhole.php. However, when I try to access codehttplocalhostbasiccmssetupcode it redirects me to codehttplocalhostvarwwwbasiccmssetup.phpcode.p  pAlso, which I thought was strange, if I try to go to codehttplocalhostbasiccmssetup.phpcode then it takes me to codehttplocalhostsetup.phpcode.p  pAlso, when I uncomment the RewriteBase I still have the same problem, and then it breaks my other allencompassing rewrite line.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI took the information provided from the answer given, and have a new .htaccess filep  precodeOptions FollowSymlinks MultiViews RewriteEngine on RewriteBase    Rewrite the setup slug to the setup page RewriteCond REQUESTURI setup RewriteRule setup setup.php [L]   Rewrite all URLs to the keyhole that translates them RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . basiccmskeyhole.phpslug1 [L,QSA] codepre  pHowever, while I no longer get strange redirects off the setup redirect, it doesnt seem to take setup to setup.php still.

Im wondering if it has something to do with my newly established RewriteBase...p  pstrongFinal Editstrongp  pOkay, after chewing on it a bit longer, I figured out where I went wrong. It was the condition that I messed up, because I had added the RewriteBase to the equation. So, for the record, here is the working .htaccess that allows me to redirect all slugs to keyhole.php, EXCEPT the setup slug, which will go directly to setup.phpp  precodeOptions FollowSymlinks MultiViews RewriteEngine on RewriteBase    Rewrite the setup slug to the setup page RewriteCond REQUESTURI basiccmssetup RewriteRule . basiccmssetup.php [L]   Rewrite all URLs to the keyhole that translates them RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . basiccmskeyhole.phpslug1 [L,QSA] codepre  pObviously, since Im building on a local Apache instance, and I havent set up a virtual host, this htaccess file will be trimmed a little when I move it to a real URL, so it doesnt include the basiccms parts of the paths, since that directory will inevitably by the root directory on a live web server.p

Negative 4069 pIm an engineer by profession, and my work requires some cost estimating. p  pWhat I want to do is buld a cost estimating program where I drag a module from a library, say a water filter, drag an ozonator, and drag a chlorine contact tank, and then connect them. p  pwhat I want to do is for this program to ask for a few design parameters for the modules I add, and then calculate a cost. p  pIdeally I want the application to contact a sever and ask for current costs for thingsp  pand super duper ideally, I would like to be able to add the ability to track water quality paramers across each module. What I mean by this is say Im intrested in pH, and I know how pH changes with an ozonator, I want it to take pH information from before the ozonator, and spit out a number after the ozonator, based equations on how pH changes with ozonation..p  pThis would require water quality paramters to be embedded in the connections etc. p  pI think it would be fun to make it an ipad app, so I was thinking objective C, but the primary use would probably be a windows machine, also would it be easy to make it look for cost data on a server alternitavely, if it could be a web application that could be accesed from the company website securely, that would work too.p  plastly if it could generate a drawing based on the modules you drag, with dimensions, maybe render it in 3d would be double plus good, but thats not within the current scopep  pso, I ask, What language should I learn to do thisp  pyour help is greatly appreciatedp
Negative 4069 pThis is a question about the best way to structure an app that has both serverside and clientside needs. Forgive the length  I am trying to be as clear as possible with my vague question.p  pFor a standalone nonwebconnected art project, Im creating a simple browserbased app. It could best be compared to a showy semicomplicated calculator.p  pI want the app to take advantage of the browser presentation abilities and run in a single nonreloading page. While I have lots of experience writing serverside apps in perl, PHP, and Python, I am newer to clientside programming, and neophyte at JavaScript. p  pThe app will be doing a fair bit of math, a fair bit of IO control on the Raspberry Pi, and lots of display control.p  pMy original thought and comfort zone was to write it in Python with some JS hooks, but I might need to rethink that. Id prefer to separate the logic layer from the presentation layer, but given the whole thing happens on a single non reloading html page, it seems like JavaScript is my most reasonable choice.p  pIll be running this on a Raspberry Pi and I need to access the GPIO ports for both input and output. I understand that JavaScript will not be able to do IO directly, and so I need to turn to something that will be doing AJAXish type calls to receive and sent IO, something like nodejs or socket.io. p  pMy principle question is this  Is there a clear best practice in choosing between these two approaches p  ol lipWriting the main logic of the app in clientside JavaScript and using serverside scripting to do IO, orpli lipWriting the logic of the app in a serverside language such as Python with calls to clientside Javascript to manage the presentation layerpli ol  pBoth approaches require an intermediary between the clientside and serverside scripting. What would be the simplest platform or library to do this that will serve without being either total overkill or totally overwhelming for a learnerp

So if a javascript or jquery function is called on click, it would not alert. if the item is a link to another site, it would not alert. but if nothing happens on the click event of an item inside a specified container, then it would alert.p

Negative 4069 pI have a storyboarded app with a chain of tableviews followed by a detail view. Kind of the classic iPhone app. There are 4 tabs and each one leads to a navigation controller.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGIyZX.png altStoryboardp  pThe issue is I really want to avoid unnecessary glue code since the app is basically finished. If it was possible to connect the Search and Favorites bottom two off the tab bar controller as Root View Controllers to the same UIViewController I would be done. However, this wont work since a view controller can only be the root view controller to one tab. So as you can see Ive instituted two dummy UIViewControllers that forward you to the UIViewController in the middle. Now, unfortunately, I have to write code to make that central view controller a fake root view controller to disable the appearance of the back button, and prevent popping to the blank root when you doubletap the tab bar.p  pHas anyone got a more elegant solutionp

Negative 4069 pIm using TastyPie and Django to build out my backend for an application that will have browser and mobile native iOS clients.p  pI have been through the TastyPie and Django docs, can authenticate successfully either using the TastyPie resources I set up, or using Djangos built in views. I see a lot of examples on including the CSRF token on the page and grabbing it with your JavaScript, and that works, but I dont understand now to actually determine whether a user is logged in on initial page load from JavaScript. p  pExamplep  pIf I want to serve static HTML from a separate, fast web server, and cache my application JavaScript, and only interact with Django through TastyPie views, how do I determine if the user is logged in and know to render a login form or the app views using JavaScript, and after logout, is there any session information I need to remove from the client browserp  pIf I were to serve up HTML through Djangos template engine, I could render the login form through there appropriately, but that seems not ideal if I want to truly decouple my JavaScript app from Django and behave like a mobile client.p  pEdit I am using Backbone.js, but I dont think that should matter.p  pUPDATEp  pI think I figured it out reading through Djangos CSRF documentation again.p  pIf your view is not rendering a template containing the csrftoken template tag, Django might not set the CSRF token cookie. This is common in cases where forms are dynamically added to the page. To address this case, Django provides a view decorator which forces setting of the cookie ensurecsrfcookie.p  pIf I do not want to render Django templates, this reads like I can still use the cookie and pull that into my Backbone or jQuery AJAX methods. Im not sure if TastyPie ensures the cookie will be sent or how to tie into it.p  pIf I use AJAX to logout, will the cookie automatically be removed or does it become invalid Are these CSRF tokens unique to each user session Ill have to test some things tomorrow with it. Is it possible to use Django decorators on TastyPie viewsp

What method would be best for data like this Id like to have smallest possible output but also it shouldt take more than 10 sec to decompress this string its about up to 10 000 000 signs when saving 2 digits per float.p  pData contains records of sound waveform for visualization on archaic browsers not supporting Web Audio API. Waveform is recorded at 20 fps on Chrome user client, compressed and stored in server db. Then send back to IE or ff after request to draw visualization  so I need lossy compression  it can be really lossy to achieve size able to be send with song metadata request. I hope compression on wav  mp3 64k level would be possible like 2001 or something noone will recognise that waveform is not perfect on visualization, I thought maybe about saving theese floats as 09aZ it gives 36 instead of 100 steps but reduces record of one frequency to 1 sign. but what next, what compression to use on this string with 0Z signs to achieve best compression would lzma be suitable for string like this compression  decompression would run on web worker so it doesnt need to be really instant  decompression like 10 sec, compression doesnt matter  rather less than one song so about 2 minp

Negative 4069 pI have set up three Dev, Test and Prod Thinktecture IdentityServers IdSrv in IIS. I am using these as an IdP for ADFS 2.0. I have it working correctly for one IdSrv but I am having difficulties adding the other two. The problem is that ADFS wants each IdSrv to use a different signing certificate but I do not seem to be able to do this. I have made three self signed certs and using MMCManage Private Keys I have assigned permissions to each IDSrv App Pool to each Certificate. However when I try to go to the Metadata page I get a Keyset does not exist error. It appears that only one Certificate is being assigned the others are ignored. I tried assigning a different IP address to each IdSrv but that did not help.p  pHas anyone done this Is this possible or will each IdSrv need to be on its own server I really do not like that solution for many reasons. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated p

Negative 4069 pIm working in a WEB project based on ASP.NET and C. Its not a new project, Im just fixing some bugs and making some updates. p  pThe website works like, if youre not logged in and write a url depending on the website, it redirects you to the login page. Then, if you login successfully, it redirects you to the opening page. p  pFor instance, lets say opening.aspx is the opening page and vendors.aspx is another page in the website. If you write ....projectnamevendors.aspx to the browser, youre redirected to ....projectnamelogin.aspx, then after your login youre redirected to ....projectnameopening.aspxp  pNow, my aim is to redirect the user to the url he wrote, in this example ....projectnamevendors.aspx after the successful login. I wrote the code to take the previous page and after the login redirect the user to that page. However, I cannot detect the page which the user tried to enter at the first time. Im not sure if the project sends the user to the login page with some codes written by the previous programmers or if this is an automatic stuff of asp.net about the default page. While debugging, I always see the requested page as the login page even though I write some other page url to the browser. p  pWhat Im looking for is the place where the requested page is changed into login page instead of the url I wrote. Is this an automatic stuff or should I look for it in the code If I should look for it in the code, where to look p  pNote The project is based on 3Tier architecture, with WEB, BUS, DAL and COM layers and WEB pages use user controls in every page instead of login and default.p

I have a div, with a background image, and then text in a span over the top of that, with size set in em. As you can see, when the score is relatively low, it fits and looks perfect. However, if the score gets too big, it just goes over the edge of the span. Id love it if there was a way for the text to be its current size for most of the time... except if it reached the width limits, and then it would scale down, but keeping its vertical and horizontal alignment.p  pIs this possible Cheers p

Negative 4069 pI am working on a class for creating easy in game menus. I am able to draw the rectangles for buttons and draw the textures. But when I try the hover select feature the rectangle appears to be some place other than the texture. I programmed it so when the mouse hovers over one of the button rectangles the buttons texture changes. lt This feature doesnt work. It only works when I hover over a certain place on the screen.

Negative 4069 pIm creating an SSRS report using the SQL query below as a single Dataset for the report.  As you can see I have different Where clauses, these would be used depending upon which Parameter dropdown is selected when running the report.  If I only needed to pass a single value to a single where I could just use the selected value of the dropdown.  However, it seems like I need to pass a dummy value from the dropdown and then based on that selection, do a filter Switch statement and determine which where clause to use.  Can I pass a SQL string to my dataset based upon which dropdown is selected  What other ways can I accomplish thisp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT     cip.CaseID    ,cip.ProsNum AS FileNum    ,cip.CaseInvPersLastName  ,   cip.CaseInvPersFirstName AS Attorney    ,c.CaseStatusCode    ,c.CaseStatusDesc    ,dbo.ConvertTimeToClientTimeZonece.EventDT AS OpenDate    ,cip2.CaseInvPersLastName AS Respondent    ,j.Dispo    ,cd.Description AS DispoDesc FROM jw50Case c INNER JOIN jw50CaseInvPers cip     ON cip.CaseID  c.CaseID AND cip.InvolveTypeCode  CP007 AND cip.CaseInvPersActive  1 INNER JOIN jw50CaseInvPers cip2     ON cip2.CaseID  c.CaseID AND cip2.InvolveTypeCode  CP001 AND cip2.CaseInvPersActive  1 INNER JOIN jw50CaseEvent ce     ON ce.EventID  SELECT TOP 1 EventID FROM jw50CaseEvent WHERE CaseID  cip.CaseID ORDER BY EventDT LEFT JOIN devJudgement j     ON j.CaseID  cip.CaseID LEFT JOIN devCountDispo cd     ON cd.Code  j.Dispo   Sent to screening WHERE c.CaseStatusCode  CS007   Closed WHERE c.caseStatusCode  CS006 AND j.Dispo IN CD002,CD003 AND c.CaseTypeCode  TY001   Closed  Info Only WHERE c.caseStatusCode  CS006 AND j.Dispo IN CD001 AND c.CaseTypeCode  TY001   Reopened WHERE c.caseStatusCode  CS008 AND c.CaseTypeCode  TY001   Under appeal WHERE c.caseStatusCode  CS009 AND c.CaseTypeCode  TY001      AND ce.EventDT gt startDate AND ce.EventDT lt endDate  1  Order BY cip.ProsNum codepre  pPlease provide any assistance.

Negative 4069 pI understand that CSS style sheets are cached in browser.  My question is, why  CSS is usually only kilobytes, so what is the benefit of caching something that small when it can prove so bothersome to update  My only guess is that browsers like CSS to be loaded before HTML so unstyled elements are not flashed.p

Im not sure if Im just not wording the question right or its a simple solution that I just cant seem to see.p  pMy issue is that in my routeProvider I have added a property called access in each route to determine if a user has to be logged in or not to view a page using a variable called isFree that is set to true or false.p  pExamplep  precoderouteProvider .when,    controller homeController,   templateUrl partialshome.html,   access  isFree true   codepre  pThen I have a block of code in a .run function that watches for route changes and checks if the page requires the user to be signed in and if they are already signed in. If the pages isFree is set to true then it should let the page load, otherwise it checks to see if the user is signed in, and if not it redirects back to the home page.p  precode.run[rootScope, location, functionroot, location  root.onrouteChangeSuccess, functionscope, curRoute, prevRoute     if curRoute.access.isFree ampamp loggedIn       location.path      codepre  pThe issue I am having is not that this code does not work. The problem is that when you first load to the home page which isFree is set to true the console gives an error that isFree is not defined. The homepage itself still loads and the site works properly after that first error. However, I do not want that error to pop up in the first place. As far as I can figure out when I link directly to the homepage for the first time it trys to check the isFree property before its even been loaded, but I have yet to solve my problem. If anyone knows what I can do to fix this small issue it would be appreciated.p

Negative 4069 pI am writing an online assessment form. On this form the user has to select a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7 people who will provide an assessment on them.

Negative 4069 pIn my CIS 220 Java Application 2 class, we have just went over the use of objects and classes with constructors and such. The whole goal of this assignment is to utilize a class and its methods to get the user employee data. I feel Ive more or less finished the whole thing, but there is one last part. The data must be validated, as explained in this screenshot link a hrefhttppuu.sh7vzeI.jpg relnofollowhttppuu.sh7vzeI.jpgap  pI would assume employee ID needs to be 9 characters long as a string.

Negative 4069 pMe and a partner were assigned a project where we had to create a GUI that implements a grid of JLabels that can be clicked to create the walls of a maze, and implement a solver class to solve said maze via the click of a solve button. We have the solver and GUI working together, but what weve been having trouble with has been trying to update the GUI after it has been solved. We know its solving the maze correctly because we have it printing an array of the solution but cant for the life of us figure out how to update the GUI to highlight the path of the solver the solve button is clicked.

Negative 4069 pThe a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma22795437586086change in behavior for the codeTemplate.foo.renderedcode callbacka in Meteor 0.8.0 means that we dont get to automatically use the rendered callback as a way to manipulate the DOM whenever the contents of the template change. One way to achieve this is by using reactive helpers as in a hrefhttpsgithub.comavitalmeteoruinewrenderedcallbackhttpsgithub.comavitalmeteoruinewrenderedcallbacka. The reactive helpers should theoretically help performance by only being triggered when relevant items change. p  pHowever, there is now a new problem the helper no longer has access to the template instance, like the coderenderedcode callback used to. This means that anything used to maintain state on the template instance cannot be done by helpers.p  pIs there a way to access both the template instances state as well as use reactive helpers to trigger DOM updates in Blazep

Negative 4069 pHere is what Id like to do  Id like to have a bluetooth dongle with a button that when pressed, takes my phone out of whatever state it is in and starts google voice search. That is, if the phone is off screen off it will turn on assume no PINpattern lock. Then, it will start google voice search just as if I was to pronounce OK google. The way I was thinking of solving this was to have the BT dongle show up as either BT keyboard or BT hands free, and send the right code to the Android phone to trigger the operation. I could not, however, find such code. The next tier solution is to have some listener app running in the background, listening the BT keyboard codes, and triggering google search via some intent. Any comments to put me on the right track here Thanks.p
Negative 4069 pI am using mysql as database for face recognition application. I am storing images into the database in the training phase and at the testing phase I will select all these images back and compare with the incoming image.

Negative 4069 pI have a table, with two columns, A and B. The set A, B is unique, but B alone is not.

Negative 4069 pstrongExplanations to the two questions I asked are at the end of this post.strongp  pI am trying to get a simple Wordcount program to run so I play around and see what does what.p  pI currently have an implementation which seems to run perfectly fine to the very end.  Then after my last line in Main which is just println saying so I get output which looks like a summary of the Hadoop job with a single exception.  p  pIn my Mapper and Reducer functions I also have a line which simply outputs arbitrary text to the screen just so I know it hits the line, but through out run time I never see either of these lines get hit.  I believe this is causing the IOException mentioned above.p  pI have 2 questionsp  ol liWhy would the classes I set to be my codesetMapperClasscode, codesetCombinerClasscode and codesetReducerClasscode not get executed li liWhat does the output after the line I hit the end of Main mean  Are these displayed as part of my Java application or is it a system message from the Hadoop installation from a job being processed  Since it is making references to the Hadoop API I use in my code I would assume it is part of my Java Application.  If this is true, why is it executed after the last line of my main functionli ol  pIve saved the output of running the job to a filep  precodeEnter the Code to run the particular program.

I had just assumed those line were not being executed.  Now I know where to look for any output during a job.  However following the directions on the question you linked to did not display any jobs for me to look at.  Maybe because I have not had any jobs fully completed though.  pli lipIve switched from codejob.submitcode to codejob.waitForCompletiontruecode but still am getting the output after it. I dont know if this indicates something else is wrong or not, but figured Id document it.pli lipIve added the lines you suggested These set the output of the Map class onlyp  precodejob.setMapOutputKeyClassText.class  job.setMapOutputValueClassIntWritable.class codepreli ol  pand leftremoved the lines These set the output of both the Map and Reduce classesp  precode    job.setOutputKeyClassText.class     job.setOutputValueClassIntWritable.class codepre  pI am still getting the same Exception.  From reading about it online, it seems the error has to do with the output types of the Map class not matching the input types of the Reduce class.  It seems pretty explicit in my code that these two values match.  The only thing that has me confused is where is it getting LongWritable from  I do not have that anywhere in my code.  After looking at this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11319727hadooptypemismatchinkeyfrommapexpectedvaluetextreceivedvaluelongwritanswer11320535Hadoop type mismatch in key from map expected value Text received value LongWritablea this was the same case, but the solution was to specify the Mapper and Reducer Classes which I am already doing.  The other thing I notice in my code is the input key of my Mapper class is of type Object.  Could this have any significance The error says it is a mismatch in the key FROM Map though.p  pIve also went ahead and updated my coderesults.p  pThank you for your help so far, Ive already picked up a lot of information based off of your response as it is.p  pstrongEXPLANATIONSstrongp  ol liThe Mapper and Reducer function were being executed, but any output is not displayed directly to the screen.  You have to view the hadoop logs in the browser to see them.li liThe extra output is something hadoop does to give you a bit of information about how the job executed if at all.  li liAny of the additional questions I asked of Alexey were out of the scope of the original question, but with determination I figured them out and learned to a much greater degree.  Thank you Alexey.li ol

Negative 4069 pI am trying to make a web page that allows the user to submit information about an object using input boxes and a save button. So far I have found it relatively easy to get the page to work for names, numbers etc. using basic types like strings, integers, booleans and doubles. I can enter this basic information into the input boxes and get the information to save into the database by hitting the save button. p  pHowever, the last input field that I need to get working is the Location field.

Negative 4069 pI am a bit unclear about how to secure or protect bearer tokens when using pure JavaScript applications.p  pI know when user request token to the server it can come with a validity of 14 days or 24 hours. but once the user has token there is no neat assured way of securing this from XSS or CSRF attacks am I missing something. p  pNow lets say user is logged into the web application and the browser has this token which is valid for 14 days. If the user is accessing another web application which is trying to do XSS or CSRF then the token is exposed to the third party application and this application can make calls to the my application using this token p  pI have tried to search online but nothing concrete or something which is easy to understand coming up for pure js apps and how to protect the token. Or there isnt a good way to do it in js atm. and you just hope and pray that the attack will not take place within the validity of token i.e. 14 days  p  pAny thoughts or inputs are welcome to this.p  pThanksp  pEdit It prob. goes without saying but we are assuming the use of SSL certificate.p

Negative 4069 pLets say you have something like thisp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt   using namespace std  vectorltintgt test      vector ltintgt x1000     for int i  0 i lt 1000 i              x[i]  12345          return x   int mainint argc, const char  argv[]      vectorltintgt a  test     return 0  codepre  pwhere within a function you create a vector and fill it with some elements in this case I chose 12345 but they wont necessarily all be the same.p  pI have read that the elements of the vector are stored on the heap whereas the reference and header data are stored on the stack. In the above code, when codexcode is returned a copyconstructor must be called, and this takes On time to copy all the elements into a new vector.p  pHowever, is it possible to take advantage of the fact that all the elements already exist on the heap in order to just return something like a pointer to those elements and later just create a vector that uses that pointer in order to point to those exact same elements  thus avoiding the need to make a copy all the elements of a vector p

Negative 4069 pI am currently exploring of using Entity framework for the windows based forms application Im developing that does data mining  for a dataset of more than 1 million rows my datasources are from oracle, sql server, sqlite. What the application will do is I parse these information to the users local client, and I utilize linq to objects in mining useful information. The said application shall only read information to the source database as its output is written in an excel file.p  pGiven the significant ease of using the Entity Framework in terms of reducing the development time this is the first time I will be using an ORM, and coding the necessary dataaccess objects takes about 80 of my time based on the previous projects Ive done before, I would like to ask if its worth it to use EntityFramework to the application Im working in How much would be the performance drop as compared to using DataReaders when reading tables for over 1 Million rowsp  pAlso, given that Im new to this technology, I would much appreciate it if you could refer me to useful tutorials and best practices.p

Negative 4069 pOk, so I wrote a PHP script thats set to scrape data from an HTML table data being pulled from an awful bit of proprietary data collection software and throw it into a database after its finished scraping.. The table will sometimes have around 100,000 or more records to it, so itll take a fair amount of time to accomplish this, despite the servers healthy specs. The script works just fine with a small data set, but when I try to test it with a more realistic, large data set, the script will run for 15 minutes and then return a 500 error to the browser without any error being logged. I removed the time limit on both PHP AND CGI set cgi to 3hrs instead of 15mins, restarted the servers and all associated services, but its STILL timing out after 15 minutes exactly... I have no idea what Im missing here, does anyone have an idea what the problem could be Thanks in advancep

Negative 4069 pI recently created a website with laravel 4. I used XAMP to test my website on localhost and to make it easier I created a virtual host in the vhosts file which points to the public folder of my Laravel app. The website is working perfectly.p  pNow I rented a webspace at One.com hoster.

Negative 4069 pLets have a large codeControlcode whose codeSizecode is given externally and cannot be altered. This codeControlcode is contained in codePanelcode. There is very useful feature codePanel.Autoscroll  truecode, which enables comfortable scrolling of the large codeControlcode with zero work.p  pThere is one problem The codeControlcode needs to handle the codeMouseWheelcode and it gets the events as expected  it is focused on mouse enter.

Negative 4069 pWe have finally converted our VS 2008 .NET MVC solution to VS 2012 yay, but uncovered a troubling problem.  The web application runs out of memory.  After many hours of investigation, we have uncovered thisp  pA custom attribute for our controllers is used to verify that the user has the role in question in order to access the feature.  It looks like thisp  precode[ScreenAccessAuthorizeRoles  RoleName.Access, Prefs] public class SampleController  SampleBaseController codepre  pWe use an override method to concatenate the role to other possible role names for our system.  It looks like thisp  precodepublic class ScreenAccessAuthorize  AuthorizeAttribute      protected override void HandleUnauthorizedRequestAuthorizationContext filterContext              ...           protected override bool AuthorizeCoreHttpContextBase httpContext              string r  Admin,  Roles  .Admin,  Roles  .Access,  Roles         Roles  r         return base.AuthorizeCorehttpContext       codepre  pThere were no problems with this code in the VS 2008 project targeting 3.5 Framework, but for some reason, the VS 2012 project targeting 4.5 Framework runs out of memory in the override function.p  pThe first time the Attribute is run, in 2012 the value for Roles is RoleName.Access and the value for r is Admin,RoleName.Admin,RoleName.Access,RoleName.Access, but subsequent calls to the attribute override method seem to concatenate the Roles value until the app is out of memory.p  pFurther investigating in 2012 revealed that if we change controllers, by visiting a different page, the Roles value seems to reset, but if we continuously select features that call methods within the same controller, the value for Roles will grow until we have run out of memory.  Is this some strange kind of caching in MVC4  Why isnt the value for Roles reset in the attributep  precode[ScreenAccessAuthorizeRoles  RoleName.Access,Prefs] codepre  pWe see that Roles is a property of System.Web.Mvc which has a different version number from MVC3 to MVC4, which is the only difference that we know of.p  pCan anybody think of why we are having this problemp  pPlease let me know if you need any more of an explanation.p

If this is a concern for you and you want to use the system library instead, abort this installation process and reinstall nokogiri as follows      gem install nokogiri  usesystemlibraries  If you are using Bundler, tell it to use the option      bundle config build.nokogiri usesystemlibraries     bundle install  However, note that nokogiri does not necessarily support all versions of libxml2.  For example, libxml22.9.0 and higher are currently known to be broken and thus unsupported by nokogiri, due to compatibility problems and XPath optimization bugs. codepre

Negative 4069 pI am having a very confusing issue with my URL resolution in connectrest.  I have a series of URLS all starting with ships for various API endpoints.  ships is the most generic and simply returns a summary of all ships in the database.  Then there is shipsidid which allows the client to specify a specific ship by id.  And shipsnamename to specify a specific ship by name.p  pNow the problem im having though is that when I make a call to the more generic ships, it is matching both ships AND shipsidid.  If I comment out the ID endpoint then it will match the NAME one instead.  In other words, it matches the base one, then rolls over into the more specific ones.  This is with the generic one first in the code.p  pIf I instead move the generic ships route to later in the code, then calling ships will instead immediately match the more specific shipsidid or shipsnamename whichever is first.p  pI cant for the life of me figure out why ships would match with shipsid or shipsname.  p  pMy code is below.p  precoderest.get  path  ships, unprotected true , functionreq, content, callback     console.logLooking for all ships     Ship.find, functionerr, ships         if err              var error  new ErrorAn internal database error occured             error.statusCode  500             return callbackerror, result  err                  return callbacknull, ships.mapfunctionele              return                  id  ele.id,                 name  ele.name,                 displayName  ele.displayname,                 shipManufactor  ele.shipManufacturer,                 enabledInSSB  ele.enabledInSSB,                 deprecated  ele.deprecated                              rest.get  path  shipsidshipid, unprotected  true , functionreq, content, callback     console.logLooking for ship ID   req.params.shipid     Ship.findByIdreq.params.id, functionerr, ship         if err              if err.name  CastError                  var error  new ErrorUnable to parse given ID  Check that the given ID is properly formatted and the correct number of characters                 error.statusCode  500                 return callbackerror, result  err                          var error  new ErrorAn internal database error occured             error.statusCode  500             return callbackerror, result  err                  if ship  null              var error  new ErrorDocument not found             error.statusCode  404             return callbackerror                  else              callbacknull, ship                 rest.get path  shipsnamename, unprotected  true , functionreq, content, callback     if req.params.name  undefined          Ship.findname  req.params.name.toLowerCase, functionerr, ships             if err                  var error  new ErrorAn internal database error occured                 error.statusCode  500                 return callbackerror, result  err                          if ships.length  0                  var error  new ErrorDocument not found                 error.statusCode  404                 return callbackerror                          else                  callbacknull, ships                             codepre

When I switch from chai.assert to the expect. syntax, the test magically gets registered. But then, when I change it from expect10.to.equal10 to 1510 it would still pass, meaning that the change in the variables doesnt get registered...p  pIs this a know issue, anything I am doing wrong This is the code I am running after playing around and trying different thingsp  precodeif typeof MochaWeb  undefined   MochaWeb.testOnlyfunction     var expectrequirechai.expect     describea group of tests, function       itshould respect equality, function         expect5.to.equal5              itshould respect equality again, function         expect10.to.equal10                 itshould respect equality again2, function           expect15.to.equal15               itshould respect equality again3, function         expect10.to.equal20               itshould not be equal, function           expect12.to.not.equal15                 codepre  pshould respect equality again2 fails, because it tries to assert if 10 is 15 which are the variables I had before and should not be equal fails because of a syntax error that I made in an earlier version. should expect equality again3 actually passes, because I asserted if 20 equals20 in an earlier version.p  pstrongEDITstrong Ok, the behaviour is getting weirder and weirder. I delete the codevar expect  requirechai.expectcode part and changed all the assertions back to the codeassert.code syntax. Now I am getting an error on all tests, saying that expect is not defined.

I divided by 3 thinking that would make count correct till I realized if only a 14 occurred in a list that was also counted so the count would be off.p  pNote that index is different in each list and sometimes another element occurs in between the elements I want to identify.  ie, the elements are not always together as 11,14,15. sometimes there is another element in between.p  pI considered trying to delete all numbers except 11,14,15 then delete all list less than 3 elements long but somehow that does not seem to be the way to do it.p  pAny help is appreciated. p
Negative 4069 pI have to implement debugger detection technique under linux. So the main idea is, my piece of code creates second thread via syscall clone.

Negative 4069 pI am working on a car service reservation system and there are three different vehicle options. I am trying to code it to where if there are a certain number of passengers listed, the vehicle automatically switches to something that accommodates more people and disables the first vehicle.p  pI have accomplished this but there are problems. Im using arrays and functions to define the amount of passengers. I am then using a variable that adds the values these functions spit out to create a total number of passengers. Then I have set up an if statement to say if the value is greater than four, change to this radio input and disable the first one.p  pThe problem occurs when this happens I am no longer able to select the third vehicle option and I dont know why.p  pI also attempted to set the total passenger value to where if it is less than five, the first vehicle is automatically selected. This did not work either.p  pUltimately I would like it to act in such a way that if over 14 passengers are selected, the user receives an error this is working fine. If less than 5 passengers are selected, the first vehicle is selected. If over 4 passengers are selected, the second vehicle is selected and the third is still an option. If more than 8 passengers are selected, both the first and third vehicle are disabled.p  pHopefully my code is not overly ill formatted. I am fairly new to Javascript and have been piecing tutorials together. Here is a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcthbg27h6 relnofollowjsfiddlea of the part of the form that is not working.p  pHere is the Javascript codep  precodevar adultsteenagers2  new Array adultsteenagers2[1]

Negative 4069 pIve created a custom DSL with Xtext which is useful to describe hierarchies fixed height of 2 in this example. Want I want to do now is to generate a simple Java Swing App that can display such an hierarchy using a JTree. I did this by extending the code generation example from Xtext, using Xtend. Everything works fine, but could be done better.p  pThe part of my template which is quite ugly so farp  precodedef compileLevel a      DefaultMutableTreeNode a.name  new DefaultMutableTreeNodea.name     FOR ba.sublevels       DefaultMutableTreeNode b.name  new DefaultMutableTreeNodeb.name       a.name.addb.name     ENDFOR  codepre  pAs you can see, I use the names of the entities defined by users of the DSL as variable names for the code generation, which is bad. If a user chooses a name that is not a valid variable name in Java, the application wont compile later on.p  pThe reason I did this is because when creating the JTree and its Nodes, I need unique variable names. The generated code looks something like thisp  precodeDefaultMutableTreeNode a  new DefaultMutableTreeNodea DefaultMutableTreeNode a1  new DefaultMutableTreeNodea1 a.adda1 DefaultMutableTreeNode a2  new DefaultMutableTreeNodea2 a.adda2 DefaultMutableTreeNode a3  new DefaultMutableTreeNodea2 a.adda3 ... codepre  pSince everything is in the same scope, the variable names need to be different  a, a1, a2 and a3 this case. But how could I create valid unique variable names instead of using the input from users which could be invalid Any help is appreciated, thanks. p

Negative 4069 pTheres a known issue with IE 91011 where if you have an SVG file where the codeltsvggtcode element specifies a width and height, and then you scale the SVG image using the codewidthcode and codeheightcode attributes of an codeltimggtcode tag, IE doesnt properly scale the image.p  pIve run into this issue.  I have a series of SVG flag icons.  For the US flag icon, the SVG object is written asp  precodeltsvg xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg xmlnsxlinkhttpwww.w3.org1999xlink height480 width640gt  lt elements to draw flag .. gt  ltsvggt codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9pt8ze73 relnofollowAnd heres the full source for the SVG.ap  pI insert the SVG into an HTML document with an codeltimggtcode tag, and downscale it to 20x15p  pp  pOn Chrome 39, the SVG is rendered properly like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfNFvi.png altenter image description herep  pBut on IE10, it renders as followsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comORtMb.png altenter image description herep  pSo, what seems to be happening here is that even though IE10 sizes the codeltimggtcode element to 20x15, it doesnt downscale the SVG  so we end up seeing just the topleft corner of the flag icon, which appears as a plain blue box.p  pOkay... so this seems to be a known issue with a hrefhttpsgist.github.comlarrybotha7881691 relnofollowstrongdocumented solutionsstronga.  One solution is to simply remove all the codewidthcode and codeheightcode attributes in the SVG file.  This seems a bit dangerous as I dont want to screw up the actual designs.  Its also a bit cumbersome to do if you have a lot of SVG files  requiring more scripts to process the files.p  pA nicer solution is to use CSS to specifically target SVG elements in IE10, which apparently is possible using a vendor specific media queryp  precodemedia screen and mshighcontrast active, mshighcontrast none    img[src.svg]      width 100      codepre  pOkay, but I dont understand this solution.  When I try the above, IE10 simply expands the size of the SVG to fill the entire parent container, which isnt what I want.  Okay, so maybe I can force IE to scale the SVG by setting the SVG width to 100, but then constraining the size of the parent container.  So I wrapped the codeltimggtcode in a DIV with a width and height of 20x15.  But... that just resulted in the same problem as before the container DIV is fixed at 20x15, but the SVG doesnt shrink  so all we end up with is the topleft blue corner of the flag as beforep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comORtMb.png altenter image description herep  p... so, Im probably just not understanding something about this solution.  How can I get IE1011 to scale the flag icon down to 20x15p

Negative 4069 pI am trying to understand the different behaviors of these two smoothing functions when given apparently equivalent inputs.  My understanding was that codelocpolycode just takes a fixed bandwidth argument, while codelocfitcode can also include a varying part in its smoothing parameter a nearestneighbors fraction, codenncode.

To be specifiec, I am fine with requiring them to run a command like codepython setup.py configurecode once they downloadcheckout my code which does emlocalem modifications to the project like populating codeipythonnotebookconfig.pycode files in all directories containing notebooks, but am not happy installing extensions, or modifying their personal global codecustom.jscode file.p  pMy stumbling block here is that I dont know how to add contributions from a local codecustom.jscode file to the notebook chain, and suspect that this might violate a security policy.p  pThe best solution would not require any action on my collaborators part.pli lipI want my notebooks to work on a hrefhttpnbviewer.orghttpnbviewer.orga, and for people to be able to download the notebook and produce a PDF.  I emthinkem this rules out the possibility of using codecustom.jscode hacks and a distributed code.stycode file, but am not certain.pli lipI would prefer to be able to simply start a new notebook and then start writing without having to insert a bunch of boilerplate code at the start of each notebook, though would be amenable to having a simple way of automating this process using an notebook extension or some hooks in codepythonnotebookconfig.pycode.pli ol  h2Referencesh2  pThe following posts address some of these issues, but fall short on most frontsp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17028342usepackage and making macros in ipython notebookali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19741672Physics braket symbols in IPythona specifically a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma19741901088938this answera notes related difficultiesli lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21122210How do I get MathJax to enable the mhchem extension in ipython notebookali ul  pDiscussions about potential problems with the a hrefhttpjohnmacfarlane.netpandocpandoca production of LaTeX files from IPython notebooksp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16205426Getting some problems with pandoc and mathjaxali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23129840newcommand environment when convert from markdown to pandocali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26464819Pandoc IPython notebook loses some Mathjaxali ul  pGeneral discussion of math in notebooksp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13208286How to write LaTeX in IPython Notebookali ul

Negative 4069 pI have a set of C files for a web application that Ive inherited from a developer whos no longer around. Ive created a solution in Visual Studio 2010 and added the existing files and subfolders to the solution from source control. One of the subfolders I created is called AppCode and mimics a subfolder that existed in our source control program. Inside this subfolder are a few C classes. These classes are referenced in code behind files at the root e.g., ActionPage.aspx.cs , but none of the code behind files can find the classes in AppCode. I get the usual error message, The type or namespace ErrorLogger [one of the classes] could not be found are you missing a directive or an assembly reference The AppCode subfolder doesnt look like a regular folder.

In my head it seems like I should be able to do this with one of the apply family.  But nothing I try works.p  pIs there a more Rish way of writing this.  Or should I just leave well enough alone.   p

Negative 4069 pI made a web crawler in C. It starts from one URL, finds all URLs in that URL and then visits all other URLs, and so on...p  pI add the URLs to a string array with a predefined size and a Dictionary so I can check if the URL has already been crawled I use Dictionarys ContainsKey method because its faster than a linear array search.p  pIt is very fast when it starts working, but over time it gets painfully slow. The reason for this is that the Dictionarys Contains method takes a lot of time when the Dictionary is very big 100K URLs, for example, and that means my web crawler is slowing down quickly over time.p  pWhat can I do about this I have to check if a URL has been added already, and a Dictionary lookup is the fastest way, but even this way gets slow after the Dictionary gets large enough.p

However, this will cause the timestamp to be updated if strongat least one of the other columnsstrong are updated id, family, color. p  pInstead I would like to specify that the descriptionlastupdatetime will get the CURRENTTIMESTAMP if strongonly the description columnstrong is updated. It should ignore updates on the rest of the columns.p  pI have looked through the MySQL manual, other questions on stackoverflow and of course used google extensively but found nothing.p  pSo in other words is there some way to strongspecify a certain columnstrong with ON UPDATE Is it even possible or am I moving in the wrong directionp

Negative 4069 pIt seems like there should be more information on this, but I cant seem to find the right words to search by.p  pBasically, I have a C application that prints off a filled out form. I take user input and draw them over a image of the form then print it off. This application works perfectly for all but one of the workstations that use it.p  pThe text on the form doesnt print in the correct location, rather it seems to be offset by and additional .25 on the x and y axis while the image of the form prints of perfectly. All workstations print to the same shared printer and use the same application.p  pIm not sure what settings would cause the printer to print the text in a different location.p  pIs there a way to configure my application or the users workstation so I wont need to created a personalized version of the application for that workstationp  pThank you for help.p

Negative 4069 pI have a list of units with rankings assigned to them and a graph to display their daily rankings rankings change daily. Obviously, a ranking of 1 is better than a ranking of 500, which means if a unit rises on the ranking list, it should be preferably an increase on a graph and when a unit falls on the ranking list, it should be a decrease on the graph. The xaxis labels the date of the ranking.p  pIm currently using Angular Fusion Charts for my graph, and I have not found a way to invert the yaxis such that it starts from 500 and as it goes up, it decreases to 1. Ive though of ranking them in terms of percentile, but I dont want to do this and normalize all the data into 100 and also I didnt really get it. Are there any other graphing or data techniques for graphing something where smaller values are greater than larger values in an intuitive way Or a way to make the yaxis decreasing as it goes upp

Negative 4069 pSo I have a 2d map array printed out. I have 0s set as a space and 1 set as a wall. I have variables such as traps and health as well as the player.

Right now it increments every time I move.

Negative 4069 pI am using SFML.NET 2.2 just upgraded from 2.1 which also had the same issue and I got some weird behavior when rendering lots of stuff to the screen. It might also be somewhat related to using several views, I dont really know.p  pI did search for a solution, but was only finding others having problems with Vsync or clearing twice etc. I checked and I am fully sure that I dont clear the screen twice and I do not have Vsync enabled at the same time as setting framerate limit.p  pI am making a game, and when just the map is being drawn everything is fine. If i then enable weather particles everything is still fine. If i turn off the weather and toggles the map editor gui it is still fine. But if i have both the weather and editor gui at the same time, each with lots of rendering going on, there is some strange flickering on the screen. It looks like scewed and stretched letters or boxes that flies within the area of some view.p  pI cant post images yetp  pPlease help me, I dont know why this is happening but it is really disturbing and makes the game notsofunny to play and edit.p

Negative 4069 phope you are having a nice day. I am currently developing a website, in which pretty much all of my measurements font size, padding, margin, width, height, etc are made with the viewport units vw and vh.p  pI use these units because they are the best to make the page look like what I want on different screen resolutions, unlike pixel sizes.p  pWhat I was wondering if its possible, is to after the page loads, get the nonrelative value of all those measurements for example, if I say 1vw, and my screen is 1000px, the nonrelative value should be 10px and replace the relative values on my css3 sheet with those. This may sound ridiculous, but my point with this is to allow the user to zoom in and out of the page, and have things actually zoom in or out. currently, no matter what kind of zooming the user does, the page stays the same except for a repeating image I have.p  pI would like to do this in javascript, since its the language I know the most for clientside scripts in html, due to my java origins.p  pAlternatively, maybe there is a feature I dont know that simply ignores the relative values when zooming in if so, please let me know.p

Negative 4069 pSo for my digital logic course, we were asked to design a combinational circuit with 3 inputs, and an output that generates the square of the binary input. I assume she means the inputs are 3 bit binary numbers 07. In describing the solution, she mentioned 3 general steps of 1. Finding truth table, 2. deriving the function  and 3. Simplifyingp  pI understand perfectly how to do this when the output is a single function combine the instances of a true function, simplify etc. In our only relevant example, we input BCD numbers 09 and output their excess3 equivalent, then simplified a kmap for each of the 4 output variables a map for W, the leftmost bit, X the secondtoleft bit, etc.. Not sure what to do from here tho. Thanks for the helpp

Negative 4069 pIm getting started in multithreaded programming so please excuse me if the following seems obvious. I am adding multithreading to an image processing program and the speedup isnt exactly the one I expected.p  pIm currently getting a speedup of 4x times on a 4 physical processor cpu with hyperthreading 8, so Id like to know if this kind of speedup is expected. The only thing I can think of is that it may make sense if both hyperthreads of a single physical CPU have to share some sort of memory bus.p  pBeing new to multithreading its not entirely clear to me if this would be considered an IO bound program considering that all memory is allocated in RAM I understand that the virtual memory manager of my OS will be the one deciding to page inout this supposed memory amount from the heap My machine has 16Gb of RAM in case it helps deciding if pagingswapping can be an issue.p  pIve written a test program showcasing the serial case and two parallel cases using QThreadPool and tbbparallelforp  pThe current program as you can see has no real operations other than setting a supposed image from black to white and its done on purpose to know what the baseline is before any real operations are applied to the image.p  pIm attaching the program in hope that someone can explain me if my quest for a roughly 8x speedup is a lost cause in this kind of processing algorithm. Note that Im not interested in other kinds of optimizations such as SIMD as my real concern is not just to make it faster, but to make it faster using purely multithreading, without getting into SSE nor processor cache level optimizations.p  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltsystime.hgt  include ltvectorgt include ltQThreadPoolgt include usrlocalincludetbbtbb.h  define LOGx stdcout ltlt x ltlt stdendl  struct col4      unsigned char r, g, b, a   class QTileTask  public QRunnable  public     void run              foruint32t y  myStart y lt myEnd y                      int rowStart  y  mwidth             foruint32t x  mxStart x lt mxEnd x                              int index  rowStart  x                 mpData[index].r  255                 mpData[index].g  255                 mpData[index].b  255                 mpData[index].a  255                                 col4          mpData     uint32t       mxStart     uint32t       myStart     uint32t       mxEnd     uint32t       myEnd     uint32t       mwidth   struct TBBTileTask      void operator              foruint32t y  myStart y lt myEnd y                      int rowStart  y  mwidth             foruint32t x  mxStart x lt mxEnd x                              int index  rowStart  x                 mpData[index].r  255                 mpData[index].g  255                 mpData[index].b  255                 mpData[index].a  255                                 col4          mpData     uint32t       mxStart     uint32t       myStart     uint32t       mxEnd     uint32t       myEnd     uint32t       mwidth   struct TBBCaller      TBBCallerstdvectorltTBBTileTaskgtamp t          mtaskst           TBBCallerTBBCalleramp e, tbbsplit          mtaskse.mtasks           void operatorconst tbbblockedrangeltsizetgtamp r const              for sizet ir.beginir.endi             mtasks[i]           stdvectorltTBBTileTaskgtamp mtasks   inline double getcurrenttime void       timeval t     gettimeofdayampt, NULL     return staticcastltdoublegtt.tvsecstaticcastltdoublegtt.tvusec  1000000.0   char getCmdOptionchar  begin, char  end, const stdstring amp option      char  itr  stdfindbegin, end, option     if itr  end ampamp itr  end              return itr          return 0   bool cmdOptionExistschar begin, char end, const stdstringamp option      return stdfindbegin, end, option  end   void baselineSerialcol4 pData, int resolution      double t  getcurrenttime     forint y  0 y lt resolution y              int rowStart  y  resolution         forint x  0 x lt resolution x                      int index  rowStart  x             pData[index].r  255             pData[index].g  255             pData[index].b  255             pData[index].a  255                   LOGgetcurrenttime  t  1000 ltlt  ms.

Also, if you comment out codewillchange transformcode in Chrome line 25, youll see the same behavior as Firefox, which I believe is due to a hrefhttpsgithub.comoperasoftwaredevoperapull330 relnofollowChrome triggering a stacking contexta.

Oriol explained how adding codetransform rotate0code forces the creation of a containing box on Firefox, but it also removes the fixedinrelationtotheviewport effect in Chrome.

Negative 4069 pI am trying to use the StringTokenizer to set a comma as the delimiter with lines from a file, each consisting of a zipcode and city e.x. 01221, Washington, DC, but I dont want the second comma to be a delimiter since it is part of the city name.  I have 2 classes in which I read in the zip code and city name, but Im not sure how to correctly use the tokenizer to set the zip code and city apart.  I want to return 1 array of each the zip code and city from each class so I dont want to combine them into one class.

Negative 4069 pSituation  I have learnt many algorithms like  Sliding window protocol, leaky bucket, and token bucket code. Now, I want to write these algorithms. I know basic kernel programming  C, C, and python. p  pDesire  I want to write this algorithm and change some parts to improve the throughput. Also, I want my code to be available for others. Basically, I dont want just bookish knowledge. I want to implement what I have learnt in the real sense.p  pQuestion   1. Do I need to implement this algorithm only in Linux Kernel p  ol start2 lipIf so, what example I can pickup to implement. I can write only loadable module. What example is a good example related to loadable module to implement leaky bucketpli lipIf 1 and 2 are not valid, then can I write this algorithm in python. But, how python will work on the lower level. As per my understanding, python will work on the application layer. However, I want to write a code, which will run in the L2, or L3 of TCPIP. Does it make sense if I write program on application layer Since, there will be a performance hit, if I write such algorithm on the application layer. Am I correct here pli ol
