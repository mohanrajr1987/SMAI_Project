Positive 62083 pIve got a BuildingAudit class in my EF code first. This audit is associated with a Building. Each building can only ever have one active audit.

The revision always comes back as 1, even when my query includes a check for revision is equal to something other than 1. I dont understand.

Positive 62083 pMany times I have a general purpose entity that other entities contain a collection of.  I dont want to have a new collection entity for each parent entity type that needs it but would like to reuse a single general purpose entity.  For performance reasons, I also dont want to explicitly define manytomany relationships as in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma258710281170116this answera. The simplest example would be a collection of strings.p  precodepublic class MyString      public Guid Id  get set      public string Value  get set    public class MyEntity      public Guid Id  get set      public virtual ListltMyStringgt  get set    public class MyOtherString      public Guid Id  get set      public string Value  get set    public class MyOtherEntity      public Guid Id  get set      public virtual ListltMyOtherStringgt  get set   codepre  pId really like to combine codeMyStringcode and codeMyOtherStringcode into a single entityp  precodepublic class GeneralPurposeString      public Guid Id  get set      public string Value  get set    public class MyEntity      public Guid Id  get set      public virtual ListltGeneralPurposeStringgt  get set    public class MyOtherEntity      public Guid Id  get set      public virtual ListltGeneralPurposeStringgt  get set   codepre  pExcept now Im going to have an additional foreign key in codeGeneralPurposeStringcode for every entity that contains a collection of codeGeneralPurposeStringcode.p  pWhat I would like would be a way to have an additional parent category column on the codeGeneralPurposeStringcode table but not the entity that would specify which entity the item belongs to.  I use codeGuidcode for primary keys, so the tables could look something like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE [GeneralPurposeString]      [Id] uniqueidentifier NOT NULL           CONSTRAINT PKGeneralPurposeString PRIMARY KEY,     [ParentEntityCategory] uniqueidentifier NOT NULL,     [ParentEntityId] uniqueidentifier NOT NULL,     [Value] nvarcharMAX  codepre  pAnd some how in Code First to specify that codeMyEntitycode has a certain category, and that its collection of codeGeneralPurposeStringcode uses that category, and codeMyOtherEntitycode uses another category Guid for its collections of codeGeneralPurposeStringcode.p  pThe key would be that codeGeneralPurposeStringcode could be a collection in any other entity and that loading the parent entity and including the collection would automatically load without having to explicitly specify the category.  p  pThe purposes for all of this arep  ol liAllow .NET code to have codeGeneralPurposeStringcode code that wasnt replicated everywhere actual utility or business logic code.  This can probably also be accomplished through inheritance and explicit mapping but that would still leave multiple tables in the database see 2.li liHave only one table in the database for codeGeneralPurposeStringcode.  This is more of a tidiness issue.  Performance would possibly be better with multiple tables, but indexing on codeParentEntityCategorycodecodeParentEntityIdcode and covering codeValuecode should be good performance for lookups.li liNot have to explicitly code this relationship and the lookups everywhere its needed.li ol

Positive 62083 pWe are currently implementing an OData Service as an alternative to using our own rigid WebApi endpoint.  This sounds great on paper but we have been running into some major issues  most of them having to do with maintainability between updates of the OData endpoint.   p  pWe are using the EF Database First method to model our data.  This has issues because once you get the data modeled it doesnt annotate primary keys.  I would expect it to place [Key] attributes on properties but we are having to do this manuallyp  precodeusing System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations ... [Key] public long Id  get set  codepre  pThis seems like something the edmx template file could do automatically but apparently its not built in.  p  pTo make matters even more complicated, Updating the model is a pain.  We cant actually just right click on the designer diagram and use the Update Model functionality because its not reliable.  We tried to include a stored procedure into a Model we have already created and it didnt update.  So we have to redo the whole diagram every time we want to make a change.  Plus the code generated for the modeled stored procedure didnt have the return value we desired.  Meaning not only do we have to recreate the diagram every time we make a change and add the keys  but we have to update the stored procedure returns.  Thats just a nightmarep  pSo the real questions are  is there a better practice  Is using Code First the better solution  If so, what is the general flow for using Code First and exposing entities via OData  p  pWe are really trying to find a solution that makes OData worth the effort and havent been able to achieve any success without tons of headaches.  Any perspective on similar projects would be much appreciated.p

Negative 62083 pSo lets say I have two different functions.  One is a part of the BST  class, one is just a helper function that will call on that Class function.  I will list them out here.p  precodesieveBSTltTgt t, int n codepre  pthis function is called like this sievet,n the object is called BST t  p  pIm going to be using the class remove function within the sieve function to remove specific objects.  Im not sure what my prototype for this basic function should look like  Doing thisp  precodesieveBSTltintgt t, int n codepre  pWhat happens here is everything compiles just fine, but when t.remove function is called I see no actual results.  Im assuming because its just creating a copy or a whole other t object instead of passing the one from my main function.p  pIf I call the remove function t.removevalue in my main function where the original object was created it removes everything properly.  Once I start doing it through my sieve function I see no change when I re print it out from my main function.  So my main function looks something like thisp  precodeint main      int n,    i,    len     BSTltintgt t     cin gtgt n    vectorltintgt vn     srand1     for i  0 i lt n i       v[i]  rand  n     for i  0 i lt n i       t.insertv[i]        printstatt    t.inOrderprintdata       sievev,t,n    printstatt    t.inOrderprintdata    return 0  codepre  pSo my results end up being the same, even though my debug statements within the functions show its actually deleting something.

Negative 62083 pI want to be able to traverse the visual ui tree looking for an element with an ID bound to the visual elements Tag property.p  pIm wondering how i do this.  Controls dont have children to traverse.p  pI started using LogicalTreeHelper.GetChildren, which seems to work as intended, up until i hit a TreeView control... then  LogicalTreeHelper.GetChildren doesnt return any children. p  pNote the purpose is to find the visual UI element that corresponds to the data item.  That is, given an ID of the item, Go find the UI element displaying it.    p  pEdit  I am apparently am not explaining this well enough.  I am binding some data objects to a TreeView control and then wanting to select a specific item programaticly given that business objects ID.  I dont see why its so hard to travers the visual tree and find the element i want, as the data objects ID is in the Tag property of the appropriate visual element.  Im using Mole and I am able to find the UI element with the appropriate ID in its Tag.  I just cannot find the visual element in code.  LogicalTreeHelper does not traverse any items in the tree.  Neither does ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromItem retrieve anything for items in the tree view.p

Negative 62083 pIve had some success comparing strings using the PHP a hrefhttpus2.php.netlevenshteinlevenshteina function.p  pHowever, for two strings which contain substrings that have swapped positions, the algorithm counts those as whole new substrings.p  pFor examplep  precodelevenshteinThe quick brown fox, brown quick The fox  10 differences codepre  pare treated as having emless in commonem thanp  precodelevenshteinThe quick brown fox, The quiet swine flu  9 differences codepre  pId prefer an algorithm which saw that the emfirst twoem were more similar.p  pHow could I go about coming up with a comparison function that can identify substrings which have switched position as being distinct to editsp  pOne possible approach Ive thought of is to put all the words in the string into alphabetical order, before the comparison.  That takes the original order of the words completely out of the comparison.  A downside to this, however, is that changing just the first letter of a word can create a much bigger disruption than a changing a single letter should cause.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is to compare two facts about people which are free text strings, and decide how likely these facts are to indicate the same fact.  The facts might be the school someone attended, the name of their employer or publisher, for example.  Two records may have the same school spelled differently, words in a different order, extra words, etc, so the matching has to be somewhat fuzzy if we are to make a good guess that they refer to the same school.  Sofar it is working very well for spelling errors I am using a phoenetic algorithm similar to metaphone on top of this all but very poorly if you switch the order of words around which seem common in a school xxx college vs college of xxx.p
Negative 62083 pSo Im writing an application where one object has a bunch of delegate objects that it forwards messages to.

The only way Ive been able to do this is something likep  precodesendMessageaMessage   sel chunks kwords arglist msg  chunks  aMessage findTokens . kwords  Array newchunks size. arglist  Array newchunks size. 1 to chunks size do [i       kwords ati putchunks ati findTokens at1.     arglist ati putchunks ati findTokens at2]. sel  . kwords do[word  sel  sel,word,].  msg  Message selectorsel argumentsarglist. delegates do[del  del performmsg selector withmsg arguments]. codepre  pIt works, but there has to be a better way. This solution limits the arguments to being strings, and is just plain ugly. Does anyone know a cleaner, better way to forward messagesp  pBTW, Im using squeak, but an implementationindependent solution would be prefered p  pstrongEDITstrong I should add that the delegates are of the same class as the object, so I cant just override DoesNotUnderstand.p

Negative 62083 pI am a newcomer to WPF, attempting to build a project that follows the recommendations of Josh Smiths excellent article describing a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd419663.aspxThe ModelViewViewModel Design Patterna.p  pUsing Joshs sample code as a base, I have created a simple application that contains a number of workspaces, each represented by a tab in a TabControl. In my application, a workspace is a document editor that allows a hierarchical document to be manipulated via a TreeView control.p  pAlthough I have succeeded in opening multiple workspaces and viewing their document content in the bound TreeView control, I find that the TreeView forgets its state when switching between tabs. For example, if the TreeView in Tab1 is partially expanded, it will be shown as fully collapsed after switching to Tab2 and returning to Tab1. This behaviour appears to apply to all aspects of control state for all controls.p  pAfter some experimentation, I have realized that I can preserve state within a TabItem by explicitly binding each control state property to a dedicated property on the underlying ViewModel. However, this seems like a lot of additional work, when I simply want all my controls to remember their state when switching between workspaces.p  pI assume I am missing something simple, but I am not sure where to look for the answer. Any guidance would be much appreciated.p  pThanks, Timp  pUpdatep  pAs requested, I will attempt to post some code that demonstrates this problem. However, since the data that underlies the TreeView is complex, I will post a simplified example that exhibits the same symtoms. Here is the XAML from the main windowp  precodeltTabControl IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItemTrue ItemsSourceBinding PathDocsgt     ltTabControl.ItemTemplategt         ltDataTemplategt             ltContentPresenter ContentBinding PathName gt         ltDataTemplategt     ltTabControl.ItemTemplategt      ltTabControl.ContentTemplategt         ltDataTemplategt             ltviewDocumentView gt         ltDataTemplategt     ltTabControl.ContentTemplategt ltTabControlgt codepre  pThe above XAML correctly binds to an ObservableCollection of DocumentViewModel, whereby each member is presented via a DocumentView.p  pFor the simplicity of this example, I have removed the TreeView mentioned above from the DocumentView and replaced it with a TabControl containing 3 fixed tabsp  precodeltTabControlgt     ltTabItem HeaderA gt     ltTabItem HeaderB gt     ltTabItem HeaderC gt ltTabControlgt codepre  pIn this scenario, there is no binding between the DocumentView and the DocumentViewModel. When the code is run, the inner TabControl is unable to remember its selection when the outer TabControl is switched.p  pHowever, if I explicitly bind the inner TabControls SelectedIndex property ...p  precodeltTabControl SelectedIndexBinding PathSelectedDocumentIndexgt     ltTabItem HeaderA gt     ltTabItem HeaderB gt     ltTabItem HeaderC gt ltTabControlgt codepre  p... to a corresponding dummy property on the DocumentViewModel ...p  precodepublic int SelecteDocumentIndex  get set  codepre  p... the inner tab is able to remember its selection.p  pI understand that I can effectively solve my problem by applying this technique to every visual property of every control, but I am hoping there is a more elegant solution.p

If I understand correctly, this is just a convenient way to return the 32 bits of memory required to create two 16 bit samples. Eventually this data gets written to a buffer, and an audio unit picks it up down the road. Even though the data is written in UInt32sized chunks, it eventually is interpreted as pairs of 16bit samples.p  pWhat I need help with is splitting these UInt32 frames into left and right samples. Im assuming Ill want to convert each UInt32 into an SInt16, since an audio sample is a signed value. It seems to me that for efficiencys sake, I ought to be able to simply point to the same blocks in memory, and avoid any copying. p  pSo, in pseudocode, it would be something like thisp  precodeUInt32 myStereoFrame  getFramefromFilePlayer  SInt16 leftChannel  getFirst16BitsmyStereoFrame SInt16 rightChannel  getSecond16BitsmyStereoFrame codepre  pCan anyone help me turn my pseudo into real codep  pEditp  pMuch thanks to zneak for this answer, which works greatp  precodeSInt16 left  SInt16ampmyUInt32Chunk SInt16 right  left  1 codepre  pNow, to reassemble my SInt16s into a UInt32 assuming I dont want to just use my original variable, myStereoFrame, Ill need to do more or less the same in reverse line up my two SInt16s in contiguous memory slots and then cast that memory to a UInt32.p  pSo I make an arrayp  precodeSInt16 newFrameInMemory[2]  left, right codepre  pAnd then copy the entire length of that array into a UInt32p  precodeUInt32 newFrame32  newFrameInMemory codepre  pThat doesnt work though, but if I do this bit of ugliness  cast the array to a pointer, then dereference the pointer, it does work.p  precodeUInt32 newFrame32  UInt32ampnewFrameInMemory codepre  pIs there a prettier way to do thisp

The SSL handshake completes. The issue is that instead of sending a certificate message on my behalf in the handshake process, with the ASN.1 encoded certificate MyLocalCertificate, the SslStream sends an SSL alert number 41 no certificate and then carries on. I know this from packet sniffing. After the handshake is completed, the SslStream marks IsAuthenticated as true, IsMutuallyAuthenticated as false, and its LocalCertificate member is null.p  pI feel like Im probably missing something pretty obvious here, so any ideas would be appreciated. I am a novice with SSL, and this project is off the beaten path, so I am kind of at a loss.p  pP.S. 1 My ChooseLocalCertificate routine is called twice during the handshake, and returns a valid as far as I can tell, nonnull certificate both times.p  pP.S. 2 SSLInOutStream is my own class, not a NetworkStream.

If they say no I want to call codeCancelEditcode if yes I want to keep them on the current item so they can click the save button. How do I do thisp  pThe second part of my question is because my underlining data source is a codeListltViewgtcode will codeCancelEditcode even do anything View is just a class with codestring Namecode and a codeListltCustomColumngtcodep  pEdit Let me elaborate on what I am doing to maybe help explain what I am doing. I have a list of View, these elsewhere in the program will be enumerated to generate a codeDataGridViewcode. What this menu is for is adding new Views and changing the order of the columns in the view it never actually edits the the codeCustomColumncode just adding items and changing the order of the codelistltCustomColumngtcode. What I want to happen is if someone presses cancel or changes to a new view by using the combo box without saving it will undo any changes they made to the codeListltCustomColumngtcodep

This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2 for detailed information about  the directives.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.   The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections   1. Directives that control the operation of the Apache server process as a      whole the global environment.   2. Directives that define the parameters of the main or default server,      which responds to requests that arent handled by a virtual host.      These directives also provide default values for the settings      of all virtual hosts.   3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to      different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the      same Apache server process.   Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so varlogapache2foo.log  with ServerRoot set to  will be interpreted by the  server as varlogapache2foo.log.    Section 1 Global Environment   The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,  such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it  can find its configuration files.     ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.

Negative 62083 pI am reading Operating Systems Concept and I am on the 8th chapter However I could use some clarification, or reassurance that my understanding is correct. p  pLogical Addresses Logical addresses are generated by the CPU, according to the book. What exactly does this mean In an executegenerated address system.. I assume when code is compiled for a program, the program has emnoem idea where the code will be loaded in memory. All the compiler does is set up a general sketch of the program layout and how the image should be laid out, but doesnt assign any real addresses to it. When the program is executed the CPU takes this layout image that the compiler made and hands out some addresses logical ones to the ones generated from the code. p  pPhysical Addresses The physical addresses are not generated until after the CPU generates some set of logical addresses consisting of a base address and an offset. The logical addresses go through the MMU or another device and somewhere along the line the logical addresses are mapped to physical RAM addresses. p  pWhat then is the actual difference I can see one benefit. Using logical addresses gives more freedom to the applications. If the physical addresses were hard coded, then the program success would depend heavily on the physical computer machine, available RAM addresses etc. p  pDoesnt the use of logical addresses converted to physical address impose two steps instead of a one to one, and therefore more over head p  pWhere then do the logical addresses reside after generation They may exist in a register on the CPU while the CPU is servicing a process, but before and after, where do they go I understand this is implementation dependent. I assume they may be stored in some special register space or buffer on the CPU such as a TLB, correct If not, then the table may exist in the actual RAM itself, and the CPU only holds a pointeraddress to the base address of the table in RAM, correct p  pIt seems holding the addresses in RAM is counter productive to the purpose of logical memory addresses. I can only assume my understanding is incorrect. p

Negative 62083 pIve been puzzling over how best to architect an application Im due to begin work on shortly and nothing simple is coming to mind. Maybe someone else can see something that Im missing. p  pThe objective is pretty simple  construct an app in CWinForms to allow the user to specify a file to be loaded, then visualize that files contents in 3D, allow the user to tweak some properties, and then run a simulation.p  pThe tricky part is the backend. I have two files to load.p  pThe first isnt specified by the user, but rather comes emoutem of an older C application and is XML format and will be loaded automatically. The XML file describes its object structure  each class, its properties, and the corresponding min, max, and default values for those properties, as well as a text field documenting the property. This file is used to set updefine the classesproperties. This file continues to change on a fairly regular basis, so the objective here to is import these XML definitions so as not to link this new UI too closely with the older app.p  pThe second file contains the input that is relevant to the user. This file describes what objects will be used and the values relevant to a subset of the classesproperties  described in the first file.p  pThats it.p  pAs I said, Ive considered several ways of doing this, but they all seem archaic. One method Ive thought about this First, create a factorydispatcher that reads and constructs a class of type Loadable to represent those classes defined in the XML then create a generic Property to store the properties themselves and store them in a collection of some sort within the Loadable object. My thought is that this way, I can reference those Loadables later on when loading the users file or when pulling them up in a PropertyGrid for userediting.p  pThoughts Am I on crack Is there a simpler way to tackle this that Im not seeing through the trees Any comments would be welcome.p

Negative 62083 pOn most implementations of POSIX threads, some initialization is required in the newlycreated thread before it is in a consistent state able to run application code. This may involve unlocking locks in the thread structure, initializing the thread register in implementations that use one, initializing threadlocal data either compilerlevel TLS or POSIX threadspecific data, etc. I cant find a clear guarantee that all of this initialization will be finished before the thread can receive any signals the closest I can find is in 2.4.3p  blockquote   pThe following table defines a set of functions that shall be asyncsignalsafe.

Negative 62083 pTo be more specific, i have written a server with java NIO, and it works quiet well, after some testing i have found out that for some reason, in average a call to the SocketChannels write method takes 1ms, the read method on the other hand takes 0.22ms in average. p  pNow at first i was thinking that setting the sentreceive buffer values on Socket might help a bit, but after thinking about it, all the messages are very shorta few bytes and i send a message about every 2 seconds on a single connection.

Negative 62083 pIm replacing standard GlobalActions Power Down dialog in Android Platform 2.2.1. Ive face with one strange issue when I display a dialog which is intended to be a full screen its shown centered and have 13 width of screen aligned to the top. First I think that theissue is related to layout style. I tried a lot of tricks changed window flags and type, specify FILLPARENT layout params, etc.  Dialog always keeps same width. p  pAnother thing I observe is shutdown animation, which plays within exactly the same screen area instead of being full screen like. Similiar to dialog which has to be full screen.p  pAnd finally I see that when device goes from standby to on state, sometimes lock screen is displayed within the same screen area 13rd width of screen, centered but not full screen. p  pSo my guess that theres an issue somewhere inside the Window Manager or Window Service which sometimes calculate wrong window dimensions.p  pAre you familiar with this problem or have any clue where to dig intop  pThanksp

Negative 62083 pI am developing authentication system using Oauth protocol and as per the Oauth standard, Once  you send an authentication request to your server, In response you get some set of oauth parameters including signature, timestamp, nonce, etc. Now my question is, How do I write PHPUnit testcases to validate if expected parameters are in place please note that parameters can come in headers or in body or in querystring. After parameter validation, I also need to validate signature I received in response using my signature calculation method. p  pI am stuck at how do I mock response to validate parameters and then signature.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 62083 pIm working on a custom UITableViewCell subclass, where everything is drawn in code rather than using UILabels etc. This is part learning exercise and partly because drawing in code is much faster. I know that for a couple of labels it wouldnt make a huge difference, but eventually Ill want to generalise this to more complex cells.p  pCurrently Im struggling with the delete button animation how to animate the cell shrinking as the delete button slides in.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUbbcW.png altimagep  pFirstly, I am drawing in a custom subview of the cells contentView. Everything is drawn in that one subview.p  pI am setting the subviews size by catching layoutSubviews on the cell itself, and doingp  precode voidlayoutSubviews      [super layoutSubviews]     CGRect b  [self.contentView bounds]     [subcontentView setFrameb]      codepre  pIm doing this rather than just setting an autoresizing mask because it seemed more reliable in testing, but I can use the autoresizing mask approach in testing if needed.p  pNow, the default thing that happens when someone hits the minus is the view gets squished. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwnDTk.png altenter image description herep  pI can avoid that by, when setting up my cell, callingp  precodesubcontentView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeRedraw codepre  pThat gives me the correct end result my custom view redraws with the new size, and is laid out properly, like the first image I posted, but the animation of the transition is unpleasant it looks like the cell stretches and shrinks back to size.p  pI know why the animation is working like that Core Animation doesnt ask your view to redraw for each frame, it gets it to redraw for the end position of the animation and then interpolates to find the middle bits.p  pAnother solution is to dop  precodesubcontentView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeLeft codepre  pThat just draws the delete button over my cell, so it covers part of it.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyYIH6.png altenter image description herep  pIf I also implementp  precode void didTransitionToStateUITableViewCellStateMaskstate      [self setNeedsDisplay]  codepre  pthen once the delete button has slid in the cell jumps to the correct size. That way theres no nice slidey animation, but at least I get the correct result at the end.p  pI guess I could run my own animation in parallel with the delete button appearing, temporarily creating another view with a copy of the image of my view in the old size, setting mine to the new size, and fading between them  that way there would be a nice cross fade instead of a sharp jump. Anyone use such a techniquep  pNow, you might ask why I cant use the codecontentStretchcode property and give it a region to resize. The problem with that is Im making something to be reasonably generic, so its not always going to be possible. In this particular example itd work, but a more complex cell may not.p  pSo, my question after all of this background is what do you do in this situation Does anyone have the animating delete button working for custom drawn cells If not, whats the best compromisep
Negative 62083 pCurrently my team is using Jenkins to do automated builds that are triggered by SVN changes.p  pRecently, we decided we wanted to use Sonar. We dont want to have the sonarhudson integration occur for every single snapshot build. We just want it once a week or so. p  pOur team uses codeclean deploy Ucode instead of codeclean deploy sitedeploy Ucode so simply using the periodical build to trigger sonar wont be enough because it wont have the site information from the build such as the clover report.p  pMy question is, in one job, is it possible to associate a different goal to different build times Im probably not being terribly clear.

My simple question Is there a way to execute a find across both a DbSet AND the DbSet.Local without having to deal with them both. p  pFor example  I have standard repository implementation with AddUpdateRemoveFindById.

Negative 62083 pIve recently been trying to get my app working with the PHP SDK 3.0 and been having some trouble with it seeing that I am actually logged in. I have the example.php from the 3.1.1 download that doesnt acknowledge that Im logged in. The file withjssdk.php also doesnt acknowledge that Im logged in when you first run it. After it has been run, however both that file and the example.php will see that Im logged in. Once I log out, example.php doesnt work and withjssdk.php fails on the first run, but all subsequent runs both files and some other files Im testing this with will all authenticate correctly. When not working, all files give an OAuthException with the message An active access token must be used to query information about the current user. even when Im logged in. So my question is, is there something in the withjssdk.php that I can set in my other files Im guessing it has something to do with the oauthtrue in that file from what Ive read, although Im not a Facebook coding expert so Im not sure. And I have an iframe app, so I dont have the FB.init part in my application that worked incidentally until the change in the sdk.

Negative 62083 pI am writing a C WPF program which sends text messages to another programs window. I have a macro program as part of my keyboard drivers Logitech g15 which already does this, though it does not send keystrokes directly to the process, but to the currently focused window. It works well but i need to be able to send inputs from my program as well. There are other people using the process so the input text messages from my program needs to be fast enough so that my text does not interfere with their input. The problem is that when I try to do this with a c program I get too much delay. The macro program Logitech GSeries Profiler sends a command instantly. I have tried the following three commands for sending messages to process. Listed by order of slowest to fastestp  precodeSetForegroundWindowhWnd SendKeys.SendWaitEnterThis is a keystroke input.Enter codepre  pIt is probably in the name, but this performs the command so slowly that I can actually follow with my eyes the text as it is input letter by letter. I have tried using the SendKeys.Send method but I get an error saying SendKeys cannot run inside this application because the application is not handling Windows messages.p  precodePostMessageIntPtrhWnd, uintWMessages.WMKEYUP, intkey, intkey codepre  pPostMessage is a bit faster but still not fast enough for the purpose of my program. Besides the method returns before the message has been read by the process, which means two sequential PostMessage calls may not send sequential messages.p  precodeSendMessagehWnd, 0x100, int VKeys.VK2, int VKeys.VK2 codepre  pThis is faster than the PostMessage but not nearly as fast as the macro program from Logitech. Also, the receiving program handles the input strangely, apparently not treating it the same way it does genuine input from the keyboard.p  precodeSetForegroundWindowhWnd  const string text  This is a keystroke input. IInputElement  target  Keyboard.FocusedElement  IInputElement target  InputManager.Current.PrimaryKeyboardDevice.FocusedElement  var routedEvent  TextCompositionManager.TextInputEvent  target.RaiseEventnew TextCompositionEventArgsInputManager.Current.PrimaryKeyboardDevice, new TextCompositionInputManager.Current, target, text  RoutedEvent  routedEvent  codepre  pThis is the last thing I have tried. It seems instant with the way the text is sent to a process. However, I have only been able to send this to my own program since Keyboard.FocusedElement returns null when I have another program set as foreground window. If someone can tell me how to get an IInputElement of another window I would sure like to know. Alternatively, if someone has a suggestion for a better method of sending input, I would dearly like to hear it.p  pSpecs Windows 7, 64bit Visual Studio 2010, Framework 4p

Negative 62083 pWhen a codeGLKViewcode is resized, there are some behindthescenes operations that take place on the buffers and context of that codeGLKViewcode. During the time it takes to perform these behindthescenes operations, drawing to the codeGLKViewcode does not produce correct results.p  pIn my scenario, I have a codeGLKViewcode that has codesetNeedsDisplaycode enabled, so that anytime I need to update its contents on screen, I just call codesetNeedsDisplaycode on that  codeGLKViewcode. Im using codeGLKViewcode to draw images, so if I need to draw an image with a different size, I need to also change the size of the codeGLKViewcode.p  pThe problem When I change the size of the codeGLKViewcode and call codesetNeedsDisplaycode on that view, the result on screen is not correct. This is because the codeGLKViewcode is not done finishing the behindthescenes operations invoked by the new size change before it tries to draw the new image.p  pI found a workaround to this by calling codeperformSelectorselectorsetNeedsDisplay withObjectnil afterDelay0code instead of just codesetNeedsDisplaycode on the codeGLKViewcode. This basically forces the main thread to wait for all the behindthescenes openGL operations to be completed before calling codesetNeedsDisplaycode. Although this works ok, I am wondering if there is a better solution. For example, is there an openGL call to make the thread wait for all openGL operations to be completed before continuingp

Negative 62083 pThis is my first question so I will do my best to conform to the question guidelines. p  pI am developing an iPhone app that parses and XML feed to be displayed in a table. Parsing is not a problem but I am not sure of the best way to optimize loading times after initial run of the app. p  pHere is the different approaches that I am consideringp  ol lipParse the XML feed each time the application is loaded. emEasy way but possibly longer loading time each run of the app.empli lipGrab the feed and store it locally as .xml then parse locally. Then, each time the app is opened, make an http call to see if the feed has been changed. If not, parse locally. If so, download the new feed and parse locally. emThe initial loading time will be longer but could be cut down on later runs if the feed as not been updated. This option will be beneficial if the user has a bad signal but needs to see the data.em pli lipParse the feed and store it into a local sqlite db. Then, each time the app is opened, make an http call the see if the feed has been changed. If so, detect which objects have been addedremoved and alter local db accordingly. If not, load data from local db. emThis might be the best option but I am not sure how long finding the changes will take.empli ol  pMy feed is only about 100 or so items, each with roughly 20 fields. p  pInitial parsing timep  ul liRoughly 45sec with full bars.  li liRoughly 57sec with 3 bars.li ul  pAny insight as to which option would work best would be very much appreciated.p

I think you can do this by just adding an if, so that if the folder name contains a comma it will continue.p  pOtherwise, the surname will always be the last word in the folder name.p  pThanks for any help you can provide.p

Negative 62083 pIs there a way, presumably using templates, macros or a combination of the two, that I can generically apply a function to different classes of objects but have them respond in different ways if they do not have a specific functionp  pI specifically want to apply a function which will output the size of the object i.e. the number of objects in a collection if the object has that function but will output a simple replacement such as NA if the object doesnt. I.e.p  precodeNOOFELEMENTS mySTLMap  gt [ calls mySTLMap.size to give ] gt  10 NOOFELEMENTS myNoSizeObj  gt [ applies compile time logic to give ] gt NA codepre  pI expect that this might be something similar to a static assertion although Id clearly want to compile a different code path rather than fail at build stage.p

For example, this is an Module for BinaryProblems like code23code.p  precodepublic class BinaryConfiguration  Configuration      public Rangeltintgt Range1  get set      public Rangeltintgt Range2  get set      public ListltOperatorsgt Operators  get set       public BinaryConfigurationRangeltintgt range1, Rangeltintgt range2, ListltOperatorsgt operators              this.Range1  range1         this.Range2  range2         this.Operators  operators       public class BinaryProblem  Problem      public BinaryProblemdecimal x, decimal y, Operators op, decimal response              this.X  x         this.Y  y         this.Response  response           public decimal X  get private set      public decimal Y  get private set      public decimal Response  get private set    public enum Operators      Addition, Substract, Multiplication, Division  codepre  pAnd the most important part, here is a concrete factory. Look at this part I set the generic values. Why Because I supposed is the best way to implement the concrete values, I mean I dont have to cast any value right now.p  precodepublic class BinaryFactory  ProblemBaseFactoryltBinaryProblem, BinaryConfigurationgt      public BinaryFactoryBinaryConfiguration config  baseconfig        public override BinaryProblem CreateProblemBinaryConfiguration config              var x  GenerateValueInRangeconfig.Range1         var y  GenerateValueInRangeconfig.Range2          var index  Random.Nextconfig.Operators.Count         var op  config.Operators[index]          return new BinaryProblemx, y, op, x  y           private decimal GenerateValueInRangeRangeltintgt range              return Random.Nextrange.Min, range.Max       codepre  pAnd to implement it isp  precode        BinaryConfiguration configuration  new BinaryConfiguration ..          IProblemFactory factory  new BinaryFactoryconfiguration         var a  factory.CreateProblem codepre  pBut at this point, I guess this is not the best design.. because if I want to use a new Configuration, I should create another instance of it, and I supposed is not the best thing.p  pHow can I improve itp
Negative 62083 pI have a question about the way Views are loaded.

Negative 62083 pI made a mistake when I rebase to a recent commit.  I forgot to git fetch all first, then rebase, and Ive committed and pushed to the remote branch since. Now I did the rebase properly by fetching first, solved the conflicts, and pushed to the remote branch. Now, it seems all my recent commits are showing up twice. What I would like to do is to use git rebase interactive mode, pick all the commits that I want, then rebase properly to the commit sha code. Is this the way to do this and if I start git rebase i, which sha code should I use, the original branching point sha code or the most recent sha code Thanks,p  pDavidp

Negative 62083 pIve been thinking about creating a forum in PHP so I did a little research to see what the standard is for the tables that people create in the database. On most websites Ive looked up, they always choose to have one table for the threads and a second for the posts on the threads.p  pHaving a table for the threads seems perfectly rational to me, but one table to hold all the posts on all the threads seems like a little too much. Would it be better to create a table for each thread that will hold that threads posts instead sticking a few hundred thousand posts in one tablep

Negative 62083 pAfter almost 2 workdays of Googling and trying several different possibilities I found throughout the web, Im asking this question here, hoping that I might finally get an answer.p  h2First of all, heres strongwhat I want to dostrongh2  pIm developing a client and a server application with the purpose of exchanging a lot of emlargeem files between multiple clients on a single server. The client is developed in pure strongJavastrong JDK 1.6, while the web application is done in strongGrailsstrong 2.0.0.p  pAs the purpose of the client is to allow users to exchange a lot of large files usually about 2GB each, I have to implement it in a way, so that the uploads are strongresumablestrong, i.e. the users are able to stop and resume uploads at any time.p  h3Heres strongwhat I didstrong so farh3  pI actually managed to do what I wanted to do and stream large files to the server while still being able to pause and resume uploads using raw sockets. I would send a regular request to the server using Apaches HttpClient library to get the server to send me a port that was free for me to use, then open a ServerSocket on the server and connect to that particular socket from the client.p  h3Heres strongthe problem with thatstrongh3  pActually, there are at least two problems with thatp  ol liI open those ports myself, so I have to manage open and used ports myself. This is quite errorprone.li liI actually circumvent Grails ability to manage a huge amount of concurrent connections.li ol  h2Finally, heres strongwhat Im supposed to do now and the problemstrongh2  pAs the problems I mentioned above are unacceptable, I am now supposed to use Javas URLConnectionHttpURLConnection classes, while still sticking to Grails.p  pConnecting to the server and sending simple requests is no problem at all, everything worked fine. The problems started when I tried to use the streams the connections OutputStream in the client and the requests InputStream in the server. Opening the clients OutputStream and writing data to it is as easy as it gets. But reading from the requests InputStream seems impossible to me, as that stream is strongalways emptystrong, as it seems.p  h2Example Codeh2  pHeres an example of the strongserver sidestrong Groovy controllerp  precodedef test      InputStream inStream  request.inputStream      ifinStream  null          int read  0         byte[] buffer  new byte[4096]         long total  0          println Start reading          whileread  inStream.readbuffer  1              println Read   read   bytes from input stream buffer      lt this is NEVER called                          println Reading finished         println Read a total of   total   bytes    lt total will always be 0 zero      else          println Input Stream is null       lt This is NEVER called       codepre  pThis is what I did on the strongclient sidestrong Java classp  precodepublic void connect      final URL url  new URLmyserveraddress     final byte[] message  someMessage.getBytes         Any byte[]  will be a file one day     HttpURLConnection connection  url.openConnection     connection.setRequestMethodGET                      other methods  same result       Write message      DataOutputStream out  new DataOutputStreamconnection.getOutputStream     out.writeBytesmessage     out.flush     out.close       Actually connect     connection.connect                                    is this placed correctly       Get response     BufferedReader in  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderconnection.getInputStream      String line  null     whileline  in.readLine  null          System.out.printlnline                    Prints the whole server response as expected           in.close  codepre  pAs I mentioned, the problem is that coderequest.inputStreamcode always yields an empty InputStream, so I am never able to read anything from it of course. But as that is exactly what Im trying to do so I can stream the file to be uploaded to the server, read from the InputStream and save it to a file, this is rather disappointing.p  pI tried strongdifferent HTTP methodsstrong, strongdifferent data payloadsstrong, and also rearranged the code over and over again, but did not seem to be able to solve the problem.p  h2What I hope to findh2  pI hope to find a solution to my problem, of course. Anything is highly appreciated hints, code snippets, library suggestions and so on. Maybe Im even having it all wrong and need to go in a totally different direction.p  pSo, how can I implement resumable file uploads for rather large binary files from a Java client to a Grails web application without manually opening ports on the server sidep

Negative 62083 pI want to connect two clients via TCPIP sockets. The clients can discover each other using an intermediate server. Once the clients discover each other, there should not be any involvement of the server.p  pI made some study about this and found many people suggesting codeJXTAcode. But Id like to create the protocol myself from scratch because in future I might have to implement the same using WebSockets as well when my client is a Browser. Currently, my clients can be Desktop applications or mobile applications.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipHow will clients discover each other at the server If the server sends the global IP address of the clients to each other, will that information be enough to create a peertopeer connection What if the clients are on the same LAN network and the server is on  a different WANpli lipClient have dynamic IP address. Can their IP change all of a sudden even if it has an active socketpli lipIs peertopeer connection is reliable for transfer of noncontinuous data like in chat applicationpli ol  p[NOTE by peertopeer connection I mean establishing a clientserver TCPIP socket connection using Java by making one of the client as temporary socketserver]p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 62083 pIm having a somewhat edge case problem in a large MVC2 application.  Initially, I had a single main view, which would load partial views while loading, which would contain links.  I have a local working environment, which uses an empty virtual path setting in the project settings page, and a staging environment, which to better reflect the multiapplication production environment has an applicationspecific virtual path.  Everythign worked fine on both.  Recently, I have had reason to switch the partial view loading from on pageload to an asynch.  No other change was made.  The links continued to function locally, but when moved up to staging, neglected to add on the applicationspecific path setting, leading to all of them breaking.  I was able to find a workaround, based on using a significantly more thorough address, but I feel like there must be some sort of config setting somewhere that Im missing that would fix this.p  pTo be clearer as I realize that the preceding may be a bit unclear, this particular error occurs only if the following are all truep  ul liThe partial view containing the links must be put in place by an asych get call and jquery code.htmlcode function.  When it is loaded by MVC directly into the page, everything works fine.li liMust be on a server with virtual path set to something other than empty.  The problem here is somehow coming from not appending the string from the virtual path setting.  Indeed, if you manually enter the virtual path in the appropriate place to the links produced, they work fine.li liat least with respect to the partial view call, it must be in the form codePartialViewpartialViewName, dataObjectcode rather than codePartialViewAreasappNameViewscontrollerNamepartialViewName.ascx, dataObjectcode.  Swapping in the longer format does work.li ul  pAdmittedly, I could just figure out by trial and error some way to swap the longer name in for the inner links as well and have everything more or less work, but its not a terribly clean solution, Im likely to need to do the same thing again in the future elsewhere, and I feel like there must be a better answer out there.  It seems like for whatever reason, the codePartialViewcode call is failing to do some sort of link massaging that the codeViewcode call which is wrapped around everything in the original nonasynch version is handling automatically.  Does anyone know what I can do to tell the asynchronouslycalled codepartialViewcode to apply the same virtual path that the base codeViewcode isp

Negative 62083 pAs a little backstory, Im working on an application which pipes KML to googleearth based on packet data from a mesh network. Examplep  pUDP Packet  Django ORM to place organized data in DB  Django view to read the DB and return a KML representation of the packet data gps, connections, etc to Google Earth.p  pThe problem here being that the DB rows tell a story and doing a query, or a series of queries, isnt enough to paint a picture of this mesh network. I need to retain some internal python structures and classes to maintain a state of the network between requestsresponses.p  pHere is where I need help. Currently, to retain this state, I use Djangos low level cache API to store a class with unlimited timeout. And every request, I just retrieve that class from the cache, add to its structures, and save it back to the cache. This seems to be working, and pretty well actually but it doesnt feel right.p  pMaybe I should ditch Django and extend Pythons BaseHTTP class to handle my requestsresponsesp  pMaybe I should create a separate application to retain the state and Django pipes it request data through a socket p  pI just feel like Im misusing Django and being unsafe with crucial data.

Negative 62083 pIve ported some android code for zooming an imageview to mono for android, but I am having trouble with the scale detector focus point. I need to programmatically draw objects so I am overriding the ondraw method.p  pThe problem is that when I have a zoom scale of anything other than 1, if I pinch on one side of the drawn object, the drawn object jumps away from pinch focus point and you end up with a focus point other than what you started with if the zoom scale is greater than 1. If the zoom scale is less than 1, the drawn object jumps towards the pinch focus.p  pIve tried just about everything, but I must be getting too old and tired, because I just cant figure it out.p  pIn the ondraw, I am scaling then translating, then drawing the object at a fixed point.p  pAm I going about this in the right manner I cannot find anything on searches that involve drawing an object at a point on a canvas whilst implementing pinch zooming.p  pIf anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated.p  pCode is as follows...p  precodeclass clsTarget  ImageView, ImageView.IOnTouchListener      private ScaleGestureDetector mScaleDetector     private ScaleListener sListener     private static float mScaleFactor  0.6F     private static float scalePointX     private static float scalePointY      private static int INVALIDPOINTERID  1     private int mActivePointerId  INVALIDPOINTERID     private static float mPosX, mPosY, mLastTouchX, mLastTouchY      public clsTargetContext context          basecontext              this.SetOnTouchListenerthis          sListener  new ScaleListener         mScaleDetector  new ScaleGestureDetectorcontext, sListener         mScaleFactor  800F  floatMath.MinResources.DisplayMetrics.WidthPixels, Resources.DisplayMetrics.HeightPixels           protected override void OnDrawAndroid.Graphics.Canvas canvas              canvas.Save          canvas.ScalemScaleFactor, mScaleFactor, scalePointX, scalePointY         canvas.TranslatemPosX, mPosY          Paint p  new PaintPaintFlags.AntiAlias         p.Color  Color.Orange         p.SetStylePaint.Style.Fill         p.StrokeWidth  1F         canvas.DrawCircle400, 400, 200, p          canvas.Restore           public bool OnTouchView v, MotionEvent e              mScaleDetector.OnTouchEvente          switch e.Action amp MotionEventActions.Mask                      case MotionEventActions.Down                 float x  e.GetX  scalePointX  mScaleFactor                 float y  e.GetY  scalePointY  mScaleFactor                  mLastTouchX  x                 mLastTouchY  y                  mActivePointerId  e.GetPointerId0                 break              case MotionEventActions.Move                 int pointerIndex  e.FindPointerIndexmActivePointerId                  float x2  e.GetXpointerIndex  scalePointX  mScaleFactor                 float y2  e.GetYpointerIndex  scalePointY  mScaleFactor                  float dx  x2  mLastTouchX                 float dy  y2  mLastTouchY                  if mScaleDetector.IsInProgress                                      mPosX  dx                     mPosY  dy                      mLastTouchX  x2                     mLastTouchY  y2                                   this.Invalidate                  break              case MotionEventActions.Up                 mActivePointerId  INVALIDPOINTERID                 break              case MotionEventActions.Cancel                 mActivePointerId  INVALIDPOINTERID                 break              case MotionEventActions.PointerUp                 int pointerIndex2  inte.Action amp MotionEventActions.PointerIndexMask gtgt intMotionEventActions.PointerIndexShift                 int pointerID  e.GetPointerIdpointerIndex2                  if pointerID  mActivePointerId                                      int newPointerIndex  pointerIndex2  0  1  0                      mLastTouchX  e.GetXnewPointerIndex  scalePointX  mScaleFactor                     mLastTouchY  e.GetYnewPointerIndex  scalePointY  mScaleFactor                      mActivePointerId  e.GetPointerIdnewPointerIndex                                   break                   return true           private class ScaleListener  ScaleGestureDetector.SimpleOnScaleGestureListener              public override bool OnScaleScaleGestureDetector detector                      scalePointX  detector.FocusX             scalePointY  detector.FocusY              mScaleFactor  detector.ScaleFactor             mScaleFactor  Math.Max0.5f, Math.MinmScaleFactor, 7.0f              return true                codepre

Now I am having the codesetTimeoutcode splice the elements from the array, via the codeicode variable thats getting passed in to the selfexecuting function.  Oddly enough the uploads are capping at around 6 simultaneous uploads at a time now, that must be a server side issue, but Im noticing that as array elements are getting spliced, the codengrepeatcode in the template is acting bizarrely where it will splice emanem element, not necessarily the ones it should.  Ive also noticed that there are often entries that do not get spliced after the 2000 millisecond threshold is hit.p  pThis is reminiscent of the original problem where the variable codeicode is unreliable when referenced throughout the triggering of the event listeners  Now I am passing it in to the anonymous selfexecuting code.onloadcode function, and the splice is using it to determine what array element it should remove, but it isnt necessarily removing the correct one, and often leaving other elements in the array when it should be removing them.p

Negative 62083 pHow do you safely render JSON data in a django webappp  pOn the server in django I generate JSON data and then render that JSON data in a django template.

Feel free to modify this function to  your tastes and the needs of your application.   Similarly, we use an event to handle the display of 500 level errors  within the application. These errors are fired when there is an  uncaught exception thrown in the application.

The builtin before and after filters are called before and  after every request to your application, and you may even create  other filters that can be attached to individual routes.   Lets walk through an example...   First, define a filter         Routefilterfilter, function                    return Filtered           Next, attach the filter to a route         Routeget, arraybefore gt filter, function                    return Hello World            Routefilterbefore, function       Do stuff before every request to your application...

Negative 62083 pIve seen a number of posts regarding disabling the Nagle algorithm in WCF when working on Azure. Ive been wondering about if this is only applicable for Azure or if this should be a more generic best practice. p  pAs described on various sources, the Nagle algorithm basically batches small TCP requests into a single larger request. Batching occurs on a perconnection basis.p  pMost WCF transmissions that Ive seen in a professional context of are small blocks of data, sent by a single thread and mostly twoway. I understand that this is not really the ideal situation for the Nagle algorithm. p  pSo... Is my conclusion correct, that its best to simply strongalwaysstrong disable it when working with WCF or SOAP, regardless of the contextp

Negative 62083 pQuestion is in the titlep  p[ActionScript3.0] How to get color uint of pixel at coordinates Stage3D, Flare3Dp  pI am using Flare3D library to render 3D scene on an iPad2. I need to get color values at 768 different coordinates every time screen is redrawn. Previously, on simple stage 2D, I could just  draw it on 1x1 bitmaps translated to specified coordinates, now it does not work on stage3D. Plus, I am a bit worried weather it will kill the performance since I really need to do it as often as possible  actually every time screen is drawn. It would be really nice if that currently displayed screen was like a bitmap somewhere, so I could access it like simple array...but yeah, I am not holding my breathp

Negative 62083 pSo I am trying to figure out the ill documented NBandEQ that Apple added in iOS 5. I am able to get it to work great for anything under 16 bands but I want more  What happens is that if I make it a 15 band EQ everything works but if I go any number 16 and up I get a 10851 codekAudioUnitErrInvalidPropertyValuecode error when I am setting codekAUNBandEQPropertyNumberOfBandscode then the first 8 bands set up fine and the rest result in the 10878 codekAudioUnitErrInvalidParametercode error. So 15 bands can successfully be done but when I go to 16 all of a sudden only 8 can be done. There is codekAUNBandEQPropertyMaxNumberOfBandscode that I can read that I assumed would be the limit that the device in its current state could handle. Well it spits out erratic numbers everything from 12 digit numbers to 4 digit numbers. I think to myself does it not like the extreme frequencies I am giving it. I eliminated that possibility. Then I realized that the bandwidth of the bands may be overlapping and it doesnt like that. so I reduce the bandwidth from the default .5 to the min. .05 no help there ether. p  pI did realize that after all my messing around with the settings that was all silly because it starts complaining before I even get to those settings. It is already giving and error in the number of bands. p  pI am posting this question to see if any more experienced programers can see something in my code that is messing me up and point it out to me. I realize that not to many have venture into core audio much less NBandEQ but maybe I am messing up some basic C so please have a look. I will be very thankful. I am frustrated obviously. Also in posting this code even tho it is ugly test code maybe I can help others that come behind.

Negative 62083 pIm facing issue for a class where I need to convert and draw GPS coordinates dynamically into a JPanel.  I have this local library data in a file that I parse.

My code currently can draw and link the nodes properly from hardcoded coordinates instead of the GPS data.  I have found algorithms for converting the GPS lat and long to XY coordinates, but once the calculations happen, all the objects print on top of each other since the calculation leads to the same XY because of it being so close.  The process needs to be dynamic because I anticipate that the test files to be use will be using 42 locations.  What can I do for an equation that will give me XY coordinates that have enough  variety to make a decent graphic rendering instead of using random pointsp
Negative 62083 pI have a codenumpy.ndarraycode of dtype object containing exclusively other arrays of different length. I have C code, that does some computations with the nested arrays, but Im not sure how to grab the inner array and its size when iterating over it using the numpy CAPI. So currently it looks something like thisp  precodefrom scipy.weave import inline import numpy as np  arrs  np.zeros10, dtypeobject for i in xrange10     arrs[i]  np.arangeii  for arr in arrs     inlineccode, [arr, other, args] codepre  pI know, that its not an optimal structure, but neither would be sparse matrices I guess. codearrscode is quite lengthy, about 100k, so including this python loop into C would be a great speedup, as it would eliminate the overhead of calling inline all the time. But how do I get codearrcode in an iterated way from within Cp

Negative 62083 pI modified my paints method for loop that drew JPanels squares to where the everything that has to do with the newly added JPanels is not within the for loop as it used to be, but rather in its own method called addBlock...

Negative 62083 pThis is a rather general question, a result of my confusion about how to compile GDAL using different versions of Microsoft Visual C MSVC and its Cbindings. I understand that MSVC is a compiler and there are different versions MSVC 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012. I also understand that C is tied to the .NET framework, which is a software development framework that also comes in different versions .NET 1.0 to 5.0.p  pI want to compile GDAL because I want to use an extension not included in the SDK builds available a hrefhttpwww.gisinternals.comsdk relnofollowherea to be used by C via its Cbindings using VS 2012, which version of MSVC would I have to use I guess the answer is MSVC 2012 same .NET framework version, but why actually The GDAL build would create DLLs. Is the .NET framework not backwards compatible in the sense that I can use DLLs compiled with an older version of MSVC inside a Cproject that uses VS 2012p  pAny enlightenment appreciated.p

I am still left wondering how I prevent the issue all together. p  pemstrongUpdate 3emstrongp  pI tried Riskbreakers idea of switching to PNG. This did not work. I still see the lines. It also increased the background file substantially from 30k to almost 200k. I also tried a completely different background image thinking it may be the image itself but I still saw the error. I switched back to jpg for file size considerations. p  pHow do I solve this issue Is it an iOS issue or something in my code p  pThe site in question is a hrefhttpwww.lfrieling.com relnofollowhttpwww.lfrieling.coma. I only see this on my iPad Mini running iOS 6.1.3 latest as of this writing. I do not see this on my iPhone running same version of iOS. Also you see this on long pages more than other pages.

Negative 62083 pI have the following mixed effects model with two crossed random effects which I am using to model tree growthp  precodeModel lt lmer logGrowth  logSize  logCompetition  1  logSize  Treatment  1  Plot codepre  pI am using this model to predict new data, and was glad to see that the development version of stronglme4strong now comes with a codepredictcode function that allows both fixed and random effects to be used to generate predictions. However I also need to be able to estimate the uncertainty in the predictions I am making, which is a problem since codepredictcode in stronglme4strong doesnt generate SE for predictions. p  pI have tried to alternative approached. The first was to use codesimulatecode to generate a distribution of predicted values which I could then summarize into uncertainty estimates. However, I found that the output of codesimulatecode is clearly different from that of codepredictcode, regardless of how I treated the use.u argument relating to random effects. When I take the mean predicted value across 1000 or more simulations and compare it to the output of codepredictcode, it is clear that the two methods are producing different results.p  pThe second approach was to use the bootMer function as recommended in the help file for codepredictcode. From this I was able to obtain SE for the parameter estimates. However, Im not quite sure how to then translate these into uncertainty in the predictions i.e., how do I obtain SEs for the predicted values. Am I missing something obviousp  pAny helpadvice on the two approaches I have used would be much appreciated, as would any suggestions on alternatives I have not consideredp

I have both regular and codehdcode assets in my game. The problem is that the retina display devices look different than nonretina, as if the image had been scaled to 50. Consider the following screenshot, with the iPhone nonretina on left, and iPhone 5 retina on the rightp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comt10je.jpg altenter image description herep  pNotice how on the right screenshot, the assets have been scaled down by 50 strongdespite the factstrong that the codehdcode assets are 2x. For example, with the leaf icon there is codegreenicon.pngcode 50x50 px and codegreeniconhd.pngcode 100x100 px.

Negative 62083 pI am trying to write simple filtering, where the user can input the column to filter and the value.  The tricky part is dynamically choosing the column to filter.p  pIve found a couple solutions on the web and am not sure which to implement.  My preference is to lean toward performance instead of maintainability.  Any opinions would be greatly appreciated.p  pLets assume I have a table t, which has 5 VARCHAR columns c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5.p  h2Solution 1  The Easy Wayh2  pI could use Dynamic SQL.  Something on the lines ofp  precodeDECLARE sql VARCHARMAX  SELECT  FROM t WHERE   columnName      columnValue   EXEC sql codepre  pWhich would come out to something likep  precodeSELECT  FROM t WHERE c1  asdf  codepre  pI dont want to use this solution for the following two reasons.  Im mainly including this as a simple point of reference before going down the rabbit hole.p  ol liIt does not guard against SQL injection. li liEven if I were to parameterize the columnValue, I would have 5 different execution plans cached for each of the 5 columns since you cannot parameterize columnName.li ol  h2Solution 2  ORsh2  pCould use a series of ORs with only two parameters.  So lets sayp  precodecolumnName  c1 columnValue  asdf codepre  pThen the SQL would becomep  precodeSELECT  FROM t WHERE columnName  c1 AND c1  columnValue   OR columnName  c2 AND c2  columnValue   OR columnName  c3 AND c3  columnValue   OR columnName  c4 AND c4  columnValue   OR columnName  c5 AND c5  columnValue   OR columnName IS NULL AND 0  0  codepre  pI generally try to stay away using OR when possible.  I remember reading somewhere it suffers from performance issues, but Im no DBA and cant back that up.  Thoughtsp  h2Solution 3  COALESCEh2  pThis solution relies on having a parameter for each column.  So parameters would be something on the lines ofp  precodec1  asdf c2  NULL c3  NULL c4  NULL c5  NULL codepre  pSQL comes out top  precodeSELECT  FROM t WHERE c1  COALESCEc1, c1   AND c2  COALESCEc2, c2   AND c3  COALESCEc3, c3   AND c4  COALESCEc4, c4   AND c5  COALESCEc5, c5  codepre  pDoes anyone have an opinion on what method to implement  Im leaning towards COALESCE, but I have no hard numbers or experience on the matter.  Maybe there is a better way of doing thingsp

Negative 62083 pIm trying to learn async IO.br My program creates sockets and either accepts them with AcceptEx or connects them with connect.

Negative 62083 pI am trying to figure out how to do blending modes in WebGL. Until now, I used the native HTML5 Canvas drawing functions, with which you can just do, for instancep  precodevar ctx  new Document.getElementByIdcanvas.getContext2d ctx.globalCompositeOperation  lighter codepre  pNow, I am trying, for performance reasons, to port this to WebGL. However, I have trouble understanding the way I can influence the blending mode in WebGL.  As I understood it, a Vertex shader decides what pieces of different texturespolygons are visible, and the fragment shader is then called for each pixel of the visible part of these texturespolygons. However, if I have a blending mode such as lighter which takes the higher one of each of the components of the underlying colour and the new overlaying colour, I get confused about the role the vertex shader and the fragment shader have in this case.p  pEven further, in the Pixi.js library I am using to draw with WebGL right now I believe the vertex and fragment shaders are only called after all objects have been drawn to the framebuffer, in other words only after all objects are placed. The shaders this library uses can be found a hrefhttpsgithub.comGoodBoyDigitalpixi.jsblobmastersrcpixirendererswebglWebGLShaders.js relnofollowhereap  pCould someone explain how to properly use blending modes in WebGLp

Adding emdataTypejsonem instead causes the same thing. When I changed it to emdataTypejsonpem and had emxhrFields withCredentials true em present as well, I saw the routers login box popup all of a sudden So, it is clearly reaching the router. I dont want this obviously  the login should happen silently, but it is something nonetheless. I get this back now in the error message when I log in emreadyState4,status200,statusTextsuccessem. The login popup is transient naturally because once I have loggedin, it doesnt prompt me again. Still tinkering with it. If I get it to work, I will update.

Negative 62083 pPlease help me to resolve the following issue. Ive got a router which is used for ipsec tunnels crypto maps. It has public ip address.p  pNow I need to make from it DMVPN HUB. Also I need to create two tunnel intefaces for DMVPN clouds on one physical interface with public ip address. At the same time I need to keep crypto maps wich already exist. For every tunnel inteface I created crypto ipsec profile, crypto isakmp profile and crypto keyring. In configuration of crypto keyring I have the following string match identity address 0.0.0.0 After configuration I mentioned that problem with crypto maps occured. Ive seen that some crypto sessions show crypto sessions have reestablished to my Tunnel interface. Please let me know how to separate my crypto isakmp policies for crypto maps and crypto isakmp profiles for using dmvpn.p  pAlso I would be very obliged if you give me a link to an article where the same topology example is configured. The main questions is how to separete policies for crypto maps and crypto isakmp profiles.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 62083 pOk, this might have a very simple answer but for the life of me my I can not seem to find an answer I am signing up users from a text into a lights out box SimpleModal which AJAX loads a new page for an admin to sign up a user to a selected client list. p  pThis all works without any issues at all, so long as the model checks are correct. I have two checks, one makes sure the username is unique and that the password has at lest 8 characters, code below. But when one or both of these checks are not meet, then the user is taken to the AJAX URL and the message is then displayed. This is not what I need I need it to be taken back to the lights out box or set these messages as flash error message to be printed on to the screen.p  pOr should I remove these checks from the modal and get JQuery to check them insteadp  pAny ideas p  pAll help very welcome.....p  pModel Code p  precode public validate  array         username gt array             required gt array                 rule gt arrayisUnique,                 message gt Sorry but a unique username is required                      ,         password gt array             required gt array                 rule gt arrayminLength, 8,                 message gt Sorry but a password of 8 characters or more is required                       ... more check follow but these are the issues.... codepre  pCTP file p  precodethisgtlayout  ajax AddUserForm  thisgtFormgtcreateUser, arrayurl gt ADDUSERURLHERE AddUserForm . thisgtFormgtinputusername AddUserForm . thisgtFormgtinputpassword AddUserForm . thisgtFormgtinputrole, arrayoptions gt arrayadmin gt Admin, user gt User AddUserForm . thisgtFormgtinputdataid, arrayoptions gt arraydata, emptygttrue  AddUserForm . thisgtFormgtendSAVE NEW USER  echo  AddUserForm codepre

Negative 62083 pMaybe someone can point me in the right direction, here, cuz Ive been beating my head against a wall over this.  Major problems getting my head wrapped around Sprite Kit and UIKit interoperability.p  pMy game starts at a table view, which holds all of the players games in separate cells a la with Friends games.  When a cell is tapped, I load an SKView, which presents an SKScene containing all relevant game data downloaded from Parse.com beforehand.p  pThe problem is, I cant figure out how to get the scene to update, for lack of a better term, with all the current game data.  The presented scene just shows the background image and a few other images, as expected, but the sprites that should be on screen are not.  Instead, its the sprites that WERE on screen when I swiped out of the SKScene last.  I can log all the passed in game data into the console, so I know theres no problem there.  Also, when I perform some kind of action on the scenes sprites removing, refreshing, etc., it causes the scene and all its sprite to kind of wake up, and all the sprites that were supposed to be there show up.p  pA second, possibly related, problem is that, when I swipe from the SKScene back to the main table view, willMoveFromView does not get called.  This is where I do all the cleanup code for the sprites, background, buttons, etc.  Its only when I tap that same table view cell and go back into the same game scene that willMoveFromView gets called.  Shouldnt it get called upon swiping out of the SKSceneSKView  But, again, I run into the same updating problem where the scene is kind of frozen with the old datasprites.  Any ideas  Ive tried to include all relevant code, but I dont think youll find anything out of the ordinary.

Negative 62083 pI am trying to develop a fast algorithm in python for finding peaks in an image and then finding the centroid of those peaks. I have written the following code using the scipy.ndimage.label and ndimage.findobjects for locating the objects.

I would like to scale this up to larger 2000x2000 image, but then the time increases to almost 100 ms. So, Im wondering if there is a faster option.p  pHere is the code that I have so far, which works, but is slow. First I simulate my data using some gaussian peaks.

Negative 62083 pI have created a Forloop that create dinamycally some relative Layouts. I have an arrayList with some elements, called photosPathList. The size of this arrayList is used to define the max number of loops. This code that im writing is inside the onResume method of an activity in Android. There is one thing that im not understanding. If i log the i index inside the loop, it is increased correctly, and at each loop it take 1 value. But if i click on the relative layout listener, the i index has always the last loop position. So if i create 4 relative layouts and i click on the first one, the log inside the relative layout show to me the the number 3. This isnt correctly because it should show the 0 number.

Negative 62083 pI understand that codememmovecode and codememcpycode difference is that codememmovecode handles the memory overlap case. I have checked the implementation in libgcc and got this article a hrefhttpsoftware.intel.comenusarticlesmemcpyperformance relnofollow[memcpy performance]a from the intel website.p  pIn libgcc, the codememmovecode is similar to codememcpycode, both just go though one byte and byte, so the performance should be almost same even after optimization.p  pSomeone has measured this and got this article a hrefhttpvgable.comblog20080524memcopymemmoveandspeedoversafety relnofollowmemcopy, memmove, and Speed over Safetya. Even I dont think the codememmovecode can be faster than codememcpycode, but there should be no big difference at least on codeIntelcode platform.p  pSo in what platform and how, codememcpycode can be significantly faster than codememmovecode, if there is none, why providing two similiar functions instead of just codememmovecode, and lead to a lots of bug.p  pEdit Im not asking the difference of memmove and memcpy, I know memmove can handle overlap issue. The question is about is there really any platform where memcpy is faster than memmovep

Ive also tried looking at the left and right functions, but they require you to specify the integer location of where the split should occur, which is variable.p  pAny advice folks How can I split a string based on the first comma, with everything to the left in one field and everything to the right in another field, in MS Access 2010p

Negative 62083 pHow can I create a seekbar that has numbers above it.

The problem is that I couldnt get the numbers to sit directly above the notches on the seekbar.p  pAm I approaching this in the correct way or should I be creating a customview that extends Seekbar and adding the numbers by drawing them onto a canvas Could someone please give me a few pointers on how this problem can be solved.p  pHere is the code I have so far, the prpblem is, as stated above, no matter how I try to play around with the padding on both seekbar and my custom view, I cannot get the numbers to align perfectly with the seekbar notchesselected indexp  precode   public class SeekBarNumberIndicator extends LinearLayout         TextView[] mNumbers       public SeekBarNumberIndicatorContext context              supercontext          TODO Autogenerated constructor stub           public SeekBarNumberIndicatorContext context, AttributeSet attrs               supercontext, attrs         initViewcontext, attrs           SuppressLintNewApi     public SeekBarNumberIndicatorContext context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle              supercontext, attrs, defStyle          initViewcontext, attrs           protected void initViewContext context, AttributeSet attrs              super.setOrientationLinearLayout.HORIZONTAL          mNumbers  new TextView[11]         LinearLayout.LayoutParams lp  new LinearLayout.LayoutParams0, LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, 1          forint x  0 x lt 11 x             mNumbers[x]  new TextViewcontext             mNumbers[x].setLayoutParamslp             mNumbers[x].setTextColorColor.BLUE             mNumbers[x].setTextString.valueOfx             mNumbers[x].setGravityGravity.LEFT             mNumbers[x].setPadding10, 0, 0, 0              super.addViewmNumbers[x]                 codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI tried the link you posted, the same problem occurs, the sliding text view doesnt appear directly under the thumb, the offset gradually increases.

I know I can start adding some logic to the padding that increases by some exponential value but this seems hacky thanksp
Negative 62083 pI have a regular expression that is pieced together with a , aka OR operator, which is comprised of smaller subpatterns.  Im trying to determine which subpattern was matched, but the RegExp engine will only give me the entire expression.p  pExamplesp  pHere is my compiled approximate, pieced expression massively simplified for comprehensionp  precodesomestringwnotherstringdwlaststringw[af]g codepre  pHere is the input textp  precodelaststringeof codepre  pSo in my matches array, I see a few indexes with undefined values since there are a couple of attempted matches before that dont match the entire expression, but also I get my match eof.p  pThis is all great, gives me most of what I want.  What Im NOT getting that I need, is to know that the subpattern that was matched was laststringw, or at the least, to know that is was the third subpattern in the main expression.  I cant rely on the length of the match array, since each subpattern can have an indefinite number of match groups.p  pI tried regexp.lastIndex, but that property only gives me the last match within the subpattern, not the offset of the subpattern within the entire expression.p

Negative 62083 pI am creating a user map system that allows users to either select a new location or select a saved location from an sql file.  I want the map to load with a draggable marker that can be used to select a new position, with the latlng populating the relevant fields on the form. I also want the saved locations to populate a dropdown menu, allowing the users to select a location, the latlng and name will then populate the relevant fields and the draggable marker disappears from the map. When Select a new location  is selected from the dropdown menu, the saved locations markers disappear and the draggable marker should reappear. p  pThis is the code I have. I admit I am new to this, and have used the Google Maps Developer a lot, as well as searching online and have taken quite a while to get to this point.  This code does exactly what I want in Firefox and IE, but not in Chrome or Safari. In Chrome the saved locations appear in the dropdown menu but when I click on select a new location after I have loaded a saved location, the draggable marker does not reappear. In Safari, the saved locations are not even loaded.  I would appreciate any advice on how I can fix the errors with my code that could be causing this. I have tried debugging in Chrome 31.0.1650.57  and Safari 5.1.7 for windows, I get Cannot read property eme3em of undefined of the main.js and also Unexpected token lt  error404.000webhost.com Im

Im using ASP.net, so I cant use jQuery to move the elements between tabs on change as it would mess with .Net...p  pThe only way I was thinking was somehow possibly setting a super high zindex on the div I want to show across all tabs, however, I believe that that wont work if the tab it originates in is hidden.p  pHere is some code as an examplep  precode ltdiv classtabbablegt        ltul idapplicanttabs classnav navtabs tabpadding tabspace3 tabblue applicanttabsgt             ltli classactivegtlta hrefregistrationtab classregistrationtab datacolorc0504d datatoggletabgtRegistrationltagtltligt            ltligtlta hrefvalidationtab classvalidationtab datacolor9bbb59 datatoggletabgtValidationltagtltligt        ltulgt       ltdiv classtabcontent styleoverflowxhiddengt           ltdiv classtabpane in active formhorizontal idregistrationtabgt              ltdivgtcontent that is only shown in registration tabltdivgt              ltdivgtcontent that can be seen in all tabsltdivgt           ltdivgt           ltdiv classtabpane in formhorizontal idvalidationtabgt              ltdivgtcontent that is only shown in validation tabltdivgt           ltdivgt       ltdivgt   ltdivgt codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com54UCB.png altenter image description herep  pPlease let me know if you need any other clarification.p

Negative 62083 pIs there a way to specify attributes per element index in WebGL  Heres what I mean.  p  pI want to draw shapes with lines at the edges and fat dots at vertices.  So, heres the data structure I would have for a trianglep  pVertices code[0,0,0,  1,0,0,  0,1,0]code Edges code[0,1,  1,2,  2,0]codep  pThe vertices are an ARRAYBUFFER and edges are an ELEMENTARRAYBUFFER. So when I call codedrawElementscode on the edges using codeLINEScode, I get an outline of a triangle. Now, I can also bind color attributes to the vertices. Suppose I make them all redp  pColors code[1,0,0,  1,0,0,  1,0,0]codep  pIf I want to highlight a particular vertex, I just write the codebufferSubDatacode over the colors before I draw the fat dots for vertices and change it back before drawing the edges.  But what if I want to highlight an edge  I change the colors to code[1,1,1,  1,1,1,  1,0,0]code and wish for the best.  The edge 0,1 will be white, but the other two edges will be colored with a gradient red at vertex 2 and white at the other 0 or 1.p  pSo, can I specify that I want to use a particular color for the elements at indices 0 and 1 and a different color for elements at indices 2, 3, 4, and 5  And all that without doubling up on every vertex e.g. making each vertex data look like code[x,y,z, r,g,b]code and having two of them side by side in the buffer so that an edge can point to a regular or a highlighted version of the same vertex.p

Negative 62083 pIm trying to cache my tweets and show that based on my keyword save.

My first problem would be that Mongodb cannot sort the second level of document which in this case its codetweetscode and thatd make pagination much harder because I cannot use skip and limit. I will have to load the whole tweets and put that in the cache and paginate from that.p  pThe question is how should I model my problem to make it paginable out of Mongodb and not in the memory. Im assuming that doing it in Mongodb would be faster. Right now, Im in the early stage of my application so its easier to change the model than later. If you guys have any suggestions or opinion Im really appreciated. p

Negative 62083 pLets assume we have the following scenario, 2 entities users, images.br Users can like images, and also follow each other. So we have 2 relational tables, userlikes and follow where who liked what, and who follows who are keptp  pSo, we are represented by a user and want to perform a search to fetch images that are liked by our friends and are named cat.jpg.p  pIn sql something like that would look likep  precodeSElECT DISTINCTimages.id  FROM images  JOIN likes ON likes.imageid  images.id  JOIN    SELECT follow.followingid     FROM follow     WHERE follow.followerid  MYID as following   ON following.followingid  likes.userid  WHERE images.name  cat.jpg ORDER BY images.date DESC LIMIT 0, 20 codepre  pThe above query will return the 20 most recent unique ids of the images the users we are following liked and that are the images named cat.jpg. p  pMy question is... How can this procedure be optimizedp  pThe first thought that comes to my mind is caching, but if another user searches for cat.jpg she will be served different results because she will follow a different set of users. Therefore caching in this specific scenario seems costly since there can be a huge amount of possible searchkeywords and a huge set of usersfollowingusers combinations. Is it a viable solution If that user never again searches for cat.jpg then caching the response would simply be a waste of memory.p  pGenerally I ve seen people suggesting using Redis or even Memcached for storing peruser lists of updates or social feed entries, but in a search scenario something like this seems to fall short. No p  pAny suggestions, tips, or links with resources discussing similar issues and approaches, are greatly appreciatedp

Negative 62083 pIm having some issues trying to understand what a nonboolean search if that makes sense is. As far as Ive figured out, a boolean search allows the use of AND, OR and NOT in the query. But what about the nonboolean search Ive read somewhere that that means you can search substrings, not just complete words, but I wanted to make sure I fully understand what each of one means. Also, maybe an example would help, like, is Google boolean or nonboolean What about Oracle Text or Apahe Solrp
Negative 62083 pI have a simple 3 tier setup of an Apache server which sends requests to a Tomcat server, which queries a MySQL database to generate HTML results. Im finding that as soon as Tomcat is started, there are threads in the java process that are spinning away making futex calls. After a few dozens web requests, the threads trying to serve requests get caught in the same futex loops, and it stops answering all requests  they time out on the client side.p  pI have tried this in Tomcat 6 and Tomcat 7. I have tried it with Oracles Java 1.7.045 and OpenJDK 1.6.0. This VM is a 64 bit Redhat 6 system, and I have tried with their released 2.6.32358.23.2 kernel and their 2.6.32431.3.1 kernel, and all combinations are showing these system calls in strace, and eventually locking up.p  precodefutexan addr, FUTEXWAITBITSETPRIVATEFUTEXCLOCKREALTIME, 1, a timestamp, ffffffff   1 ETIMEDOUT Connection timed out futexan addr, FUTEXWAKEPRIVATE, 1  0 codepre  pThe JVM does this with the default memory, or even if I increase the available mem to 3GB of the 4GB on the machine. I ran with a GC logger, and GC printed a few minor collections, and was not doing one when the lockup occurred. This machine was created in Jan 2014, so is not in any leap second situations.p  pSo my questions would be  why is Java making all of these futex calls in a fast loop even when the JVM should be idle  are they normal should they be getting the timeout and is there a known fixp  pThank you for info insights.p

Negative 62083 pMy app has a section that is perfect for the codeMaster  Detailcode pattern.  I have implemented fragments in an effort to optimize for tablets.  Everything is going pretty smoothly, but I am curious what I should do if the user triggers the codeMaster  Detailcode which currently happens when the device is put into codelandscapecode from the codeDetailActivitycode.  p  pI tried switching to codelandscapecode on the codegmailcode app when on an email detail, and it does in fact transition to a codeMaster  Detailcode with the proper item in the codeListViewcode selected.p  pI could see this being simple if my codeListViewcode was backed by static data, but it is backed by codeSQLitecode data.  I thought about using a codepositioncode value that would be passed to the codeDetailActivitycode for use when constructing the codeListFragmentcode, but Im afraid that when my codeListFragmentcode is created and it requeries the database the data set may have changed, thus making the codepositioncode value stale.p

Negative 62083 pHi guys i know that there are many answers about JsonArrays but in this case is different , i found an android exmaple using JSON when i run it it works perefect, it has 3 classes , each of them makes a php request to a website, wich returns a json , then the program parses it and makes a list view , my problem is that , when i run the program it works well using the urls that came with the default project , but when i use the same phps in other server  for doing my own project it returns nothing and log cat says that it cannot be converted to JsonArrayp  pok... lets begin

I have made it so that a function I called disco fog is an option in that menu.  What I want to do is make disco fog toggleable.  So here is what I have tried so far.

Negative 62083 pIm looking for an efficient way to take a raw sql file and have it executed synchronously against a postgres database, akin to if you ran it through codepsqlcode.p  pI have an sql file which creates all databases, imports data, etc. I need to execute this using node.js but cannot find any module which does this automatically. For the node.js application itself, we use nodepostgres pg, knex.js and bookshelf.js. I assume though that pg is best for this.p  pOne alternative I can think of is to read the full file, split it by semicolons, replace newlines with spaces, trim any duplicate space, then feed it into pg one by one in a manner that theyre executed sequentially, not asynchronously. Im a little surprised if this is truly the most efficient way and also if no libraries exist yet to solve this. Im a little hesitant to jump into it seeing as SQL syntax can itself be a little challenging and I might accidentally mash it up.p  pSome clarifications in advancep  ul licodepsqlcode cannot be used as its not installed on the target machineli liIve chosen to develop and source control sql statements in sql native form, because its a lot easier for a DBA to use and manipulate itli ul

Negative 62083 pIm planning to create a website that lists a certain product  e.g. a pc mouse  where you can design your own given a set of parameters. In this case you can change the color of the mouse, the design of the mouse wheel, maybe a different look for the left and right buttons etc. The problem im running into is to implement it in a way that when for example, in a collection of mouse wheel designs, I click a certain mouse wheel design and the main mouse images mouse wheel will be changed to the selected mouse wheel. I really have no idea how to do this  js, html5 canvas . can anyone point me to a certain tool or maybe a technique on doing this ive been searching google for a while now and still havent have the slightest idea on how to do this.

The goal is to have a text area created for the sole purpose of receiving noteslog entries from the remainder of the javascript via node and socket.io.

When I scroll the table view, I want to see the tableview scrolling under the UINavigationbar navbars alpha is set to 0.96f and it works in all other places where navbar is provided by the navigation controller. p  pI assume I dont see it now because the top edge of the table view is equal to bottom edge of uinavigation bar so I think that is the reason that it is not going under the UINavigationBar. p  pSo, how can I make the UITableView go under UINavigationBar when scrolled p

Negative 62083 pNote This is not about how to make a folder or a symbolic linkalias to a volume using Objective C.p  pIm attempting to make a program that works similarly to how Mac OS creates a Finder sidebar and Desktop link to a volume when a external volume is mounted, but works for NTFS. Currently, to mount an NTFS volume as readwrite in Mac OS, you have to declare the volume as coderw,nobrowsecode when mounting coderwcode is for readwrite, and codenobrowsecode is for declaring the volume as private and not to hook into the various GUI functions that occur when a volume is mounted. It is not possible without altering the kext or codemountntfscode to mount the volume without declaring codenobrowsecode. p  pUnfortunately, codenobrowsecode marks the volumes as private and they dont show up in the Finder sidebar and on the Desktop by default when mounted. I would like to be able to replicate the functionality of a noncodenobrowsecode volume for a coderw,nobrowsecode mounted NTFS volume. I know I can create a symbolic link on the Desktop, but this isnt the same thing.p  pIs it possible to use Objective C and hook into Finder or some system level API like codeCoreFoundationcode to make it show the volume on the Desktop, or mark the volume as nonprivate after being mounted I assume no for the second one, since this is a kernel levelkext thing, but not sure about the first.p

Negative 62083 pMy application uses scripts. So far, Ive used C for the scripts and compiled them using the codeCodeDomProvidercode. However, Ive been thinking about switching to Lua using the codeNLuacode fork a fork of the codeLuaInterfacecode because its much easier to write scripts with plus Im familiar with the syntax.p  pHowever, Im facing a problem. Currently, I have an codeasynchronouscode method that returns a codeTaskltboolgtcode. It uses a codeTaskCompletionSourcecode object and returns its codeResultcode. That way, I can halt the execution of the script because it waits until the codeResultcode of the codeTaskCompletionSourcecode object has been set, and only then returns this codeResultcode.p  pNow, with Lua  its different. I obviously cant use the codeawaitcodeoperator because its a syntax of C 5.0, and you cant use that in Lua. So thats why Im asking if theres a workaround for this. I want to be able to achieve the same result as my old code which is posted beneath this post without having to use the codeawaitcodeoperator.

Negative 62083 pI am in the process of partitioning a very large  20 million rows table into logically partitioned tables which will result in older, less frequently viewed and updated, rows being split into multiple tables.  Essentially a manual approach to the Enterprise level feature of automated table partitioning.p  pWe have two tables, Product and Cost.  Currently all Product records record their Costs in a central table, resulting in millions of rows.  The plan is to segregate Cost into many tables Cost1, Cost2, Cost3, ... to reduce the number of rows in each table, and each Product record will know which table to gather its own costs from.p  pCurrently all INSERTs into this table are handled through a Stored Procedure lets call this InsertCosts.  Within the procedure, currently the Cost table is referenced.p  pWe have two options for how to proceedp  ol liDo we work out some dynamic SQL within a single stored procedure which will look at the Product we are inserting for, and run a SQL Exec string to insert the record The stored proc is 500 lines long, to add context to the complexity of the amount of work it may need to do.li liOr  do we allow the application to clone the stored proc many times, so we have InsertCosts1, InsertCosts2, InsertCosts3... and these are all fixed procedures.li ol  pMy gut instinct says that we should go with Option 2.  The risk, however, is whether this is a scalable solution We can revert back to option 1 fairly easily, and when it comes to creating the cloned Stored Procs this will also be simple for us to do so I dont any complexity of doing this to detract form the answer.p

I have already tried bindValue. Please, if you need any more info just comment below and ask.

Negative 62083 pIm trying to use the application.worksheetfunction.min and max and average.  I seem to keep getting the 1004 error.p  pMy workbook has multiple tabs.  Sheet1 and WindCalc.  Im attempting to get the MinMaxAvg from 2 columns on Windcalc and write the results into some intermediates and eventually write them into SHeet1  which is a summary of many itterations of WindCalc.p  pWith that in mind, some code snippetsp  precode at the top of the routine I initialize Sheet1 and WindCalc Set wb  ThisWorkbook wb.Activate  clear contents of the result sheet Set ws  SheetsSheet1 ws.Select ws.RangeA1XFD100000.Select Selection.Delete ShiftxlUp  iRow is used as the index of the row to write on iRow  1  Call Createtitlesws  Set wc  wb.SheetsWindCalc wc.Activate  ltsnipgt      Clean off WindCalc prior data     lRow  wc.RangeA amp Rows.Count.EndxlUp.Row  last row used on prior pass     If lRow lt 5 Then         lRow  6     End If     wc.RangeA5A amp lRow.Value  Null     wc.RangeC5C amp lRow.Value  Null     wc.RangeE5E amp lRow.Value  Null     wc.RangeG5G amp lRow.Value  Null     wc.RangeH5H amp lRow.Value  Null    That all works as I expect.    I end up with Columns A,C,E,G,and H empty and then write raw data into them.   an example of how the columns are populated     wscsv.RangeA1A amp rngEnd.Copy     wc.RangeA5A amp rngEnd  5.PasteSpecial   wscsv is a separate workbook holding raw data  I close it after populating the 5 columns  I have CalculationxlCalculationMamnual set while copying into WindCalc       Turn Calculations back On     Application.Calculation  xlCalculationAutomatic       close csv file     wbcsv.Close SaveChangesFalse        Output   and here is where Im stuck ...  rngEnd is usually in the 530 lines or so range.  There are no headers in the raw data and there are 5 lines of header information in   WindCalc  so rngEnd5 is my way of defining the range to evaluate      minWind  Application.WorksheetFunction.Minwc.RangeAA5, AA amp rngEnd  5     codepre  pMy applogies for the snippets.

Ive defined the JNDIRealm on my server.xml and enabled authentication on tomcat catalina options  but couldnt get the hawt to use this realm. I saw that hawt website presents that the default behavior on tomcat is using users data file tomcatusers.xml  and I succeed using it as described in website. But is there any way to work with JNDIRealm instead this default UserDatabaseRealm behaviorp  pAny help appreciated. Thx.p

Negative 62083 pSo the Question is pretty straightforward. In my project, I need to consume services which are made in JAVA and they are in WSDL format. I need to make an app, which should be available for all the platforms. Since its essentially fetching service data and displaying, I think this MultiDevice Hybrid App project in Visual Studio should be best thing to go. But Im not able to find how to add service reference in order to consume those services as I have been doing in other type of projects. Hence the Question Can we even add service Reference to this type of projectp

Negative 62083 pI want to know if it is possible to get photos and videos from instagram with a specific hashtag to post on a website Im developing. I searched other questions before and I and I got a partial answer. I was referred to the Instagram API endpoints but no other questions were answered about getting pictures and videos based on a specific hashtagtag. Im new to this so I may be missing some obvious things but Im willing to learn all I can about this. p
Negative 62083 pIm asked to make a simple Propeller using codeGLTRIANGLESTRIPcode. However, writing the structure wasnt hard, but making the lighting to work properly is causing me trouble as Im using codeGLTRIANGLESTRIPcode. Before I used codeGLPOLYGONcode and making lighting for shapes e.g. rectangles was very easy as I just specify codeglNormal3fcode once for each shape.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Based on some internet search, apparently I need to specify the normal vector for vortex not each shape.

Negative 62083 pI am trying to draw an image that is larger than the screen, and let the user scroll around it. The image is some graphs that are calculated by my code from some data. This is in Android using Java.p  pWhat I want is a View actually a SurfaceView that can be scrolled by the user. I have tried putting a SurfaceView inside a ScrollView but the whole image drawn by the SurfaceView is very large and so a there are performance issues as my app is drawing the whole SurfaceView when it should only need to do the part that is in the viewport and b my app crashes with dimensions too large... out of memory errors.p  pIt would be best for me if the View could implement scrolling vertical only and then pass the yvalue to my code so it could draw the visible part of my image in the viewport.p  pAlternatively I could capture the mouse events and calculate the yvalue myself.p  pDoes anyone have any code so that I can do thisp  pUpdate I should clarify, the image is drawn by my program code using Canvas.drawLine and the like. I can calculate which parts of the image fit within my viewport, provided I have the state of the scroll as a yvalue, and I can calculate the absolute ycoordinate of each point by subtracting scroll yvalue. What I need is something that works to find when the user scrolls the image and what the resulting yvalue is. A scrollbar would also be nice.p  pUpdate I am using SurfaceView so that I can update the image from another Thread and so improve user interface performance.p

Negative 62083 pHello Stackoverflow,p  pI was trying to connect to my MySQL database through Coda 2. I connected, created a database called database1 for example, then I tried to create a table called user, but I get this errorp  precodeMySQL said Table user is read only codepre  pI was surprised because it had worked previously with other databases long time ago. I went to my xampp files, xamppmysqldatadatabase1 and then I found out that user.ibd is there alone. So I first tried to change the properties of the files by disabling readonly. The problem is that when I  did that, close  the properties windows, and opened again I would get the readonly check box on. So I gave up on that. So I said ok, I will just create the database from my server instead. So I when to phpmyadmin, I see that database1 is created but there is no table called user. So I try to create a table and I get this errorp  precode1813  Tablespace for table database1.user exists. Please DISCARD the tablespace before IMPORT. codepre  pI then I found out I cannot even do much with phpmyadmin from my server. I tried reinstalling xampp, but it was impossible for me to remove the origianal because it was already in use. Please help me and thank youp  pEDIT I can apparently create databases but not tables. Just to clear that up.p

Negative 62083 pIm writing parallel code to enumerate over a large set of CSV files, each full of Historical Stock Data over 6500 Symbols and calculate whether each stock has reached its alltime high.    p  pIve implemented a Thread Pool and TThread descendant class to split up the list of symbols equally among Threads, which threads are then allocated to SEPARATE cores of my i7 machine.  I setup the threads to each have a copy of all the data they need when they are created before unsuspending them, so theres no locking needed or going on while the threads are processing.  Once all the threads have finished, I aggregate the result data of each thread into the main program.p  pIve currently tested my code using several of the multithreaded memory managers mentioned a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions6072269needmultithreadingmemorymanager60764076076407 titlehere on Stackoverflowhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions6072269needmultithreadingmemorymanager60764076076407a.  So far, SapMM seems to be the most efficient one without causing access violations.p  pThe problem is that adding more threads is not proportionately speeding up the time it takes to finish calculating all the highs.

I need to get to the bottom of why the multicore speedup is trailing off, rather than just dabble around the edges of the problem.

I tried to play around with negative codemarginleftcode and codemarginrightcode values for coderatingnumbercode, which seems to help a bit but still had trouble keeping the rating circle on the progress bar for really high progress .p  pIm looking for the CSS tweak to keep the rating circle on the progress bar for every rating cases.p  pjsfiddle for 95 a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net4pzm98b0 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net4pzm98b0ap  pjsfiddle for 50 a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netz1wtqebj relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netz1wtqebjap  precodeltdiv idprogressbargt     ltdiv idprogressgtltdivgt        ltdiv idratingnumbergt          9.5     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre    precodebody      backgroundcolor aaa     padding 40px   progressbar      width 100     height 20px     backgroundcolor white     mozborderradius 25px     webkitborderradius 25px     borderradius 25px     padding 3px     border 3px solid 666666     clear both   progress      background green     height 20px     width 0     maxwidth 100     float left     webkitanimation progress 2s 1 forwards     mozanimation progress 2s 1 forwards     msanimation progress 2s 1 forwards     animation progress 2s 1 forwards     webkitbordertoprightradius 8px     webkitborderbottomrightradius 8px     mozborderradiustopright 8px     mozborderradiusbottomright 8px     bordertoprightradius 8px     borderbottomrightradius 8px     webkitbordertopleftradius 20px     webkitborderbottomleftradius 20px     mozborderradiustopleft 20px     mozborderradiusbottomleft 20px     bordertopleftradius 20px     borderbottomleftradius 20px   ratingnumber     border 4px solid green     background white     padding 10px     float left     fontsize 28px     fontfamily Roboto Condensed, sansserif     fontweight bold     borderradius 50     position relative     left 30px     top 24px   webkitkeyframes progress       from       to  width 95    mozkeyframes progress       from       to  width 95    mskeyframes progress       from       to  width 95    keyframes progress       from       to  width 95   codepre

Negative 62083 pIm using clipper which is awesome to offset polygons. My problem happens when offsetting a polygon inwards generates more than a single polygon  Imagine the figure eight where the two circle are connected by a region with a certain width. Offsetting would result in two disconnected circlep  pThe output I would like is to still have a single polygon which might have thin areas with an offset less than the requested. My initial thought was to connect the resulting polygons using a straight line but this solution wont work for me since this line might cross the original polygon. I guess what I need is to somehow also use the skeleton of the polygon...p  pIs it possible using clipper  other librariesp

Negative 62083 pI am thinking about a Caret and Secure Shell, all Chrome based developer workflow. I work on a remote server via ssh but develop locally. I use an dynamic language R so my current workflow involves writing some text in Sublime, highlighting what I want interpreted, and hitting ctrlenter to send the text and execute it in a terminal widow which is sshd into the server. This way I can see results without an interruption in my R workflow. This is done with a script I edited from GitHub for Sublime and uses auto hot key. Is something similar possible using Caret or any other Chrome text editor and the Secure Shell app Maybe it could be done with message passing instead of AHKp

Negative 62083 pIm using Visual Studio 2013, C and working with a web service.p  pMy company has a web service .NET ASMX offering clients to integrate to our ERP. We have a list of available web methods, eg. codeValidateOrdercode, codeSaveOrdercode, codeGetCustomercode etc that the clients use to access and saveupdate data.p  pSince different clients have different data needs, and they pay for different levels of service, we want to limit which web methods each client has access to. My plan is to divide the web service into two or more ASMX pages, preferably one for each client, to differentiate between which web methods we expose to each client.p  pIve tried adding new ASMX pages where I remove some of the available web methods and relevant code in the .cs file. But it seems that the generated WSDL is the same, no matter which ASMX page I use. That is codehttpwebserviceservice.asmxwsdlcode and codehttpwebserviceservicelimited.asmxwsdlcode generate the same result.p  pIve also tried manually editing the WSDL to remove the unwanted web methods. emThis does actually work.em But it is very cumbersome and will require a lot of manual work every time web methods are addedchanged.p  pPreferably I would like to be able to create a new ASMX page, publish, and when the client accesses the new page they get an automated WSDL emfor that pageem instead of a WSDL for the whole web service. Also, this would partially avoid breaking the WSDL contract every time we make a change for one specific client, as we could have different contracts for each client.p  pIs there an automated way to get separate WSDL definitions for each ASMX page, depending on which web methods are availablep

Negative 62083 pI have spent a large amount of time trying to figure out how to generate a desired plot, and was wondering if any one can help. The plot is to illustrate an interaction between time and group on a binary response variable, which increases faster over time for group 2 than group 1.

After some testing i found that the problem was the regionParameter, if i left that out the geocoding api also found the administrative area Sachsen. Here is an example requestp  pa hrefhttpmaps.googleapis.commapsapigeocodejsonaddresssachsenampsensorfalseamplanguagedeampregionde relnofollowhttpmaps.googleapis.commapsapigeocodejsonaddresssachsenampsensorfalseamplanguagedeampregiondeap  pHere without region a hrefhttpmaps.googleapis.commapsapigeocodejsonaddresssachsenampsensorfalseamplanguagede relnofollowhttpmaps.googleapis.commapsapigeocodejsonaddresssachsenampsensorfalseamplanguagedeap  pBoth results are located in Germany de. So it seems like a bug, that the geocodingapi does not find any adminsitrative areas if a region is used in the request.p  pCan anyone confirm that problemp  pMany greetings, Sebastianp
Negative 62083 pmy target is an Android app for VoIP chat with PTT push to talk. Due to PTT one android device speaks, the other N Android devices listen, I need multicast address. I think that the right solution is RTP. For several reasons I cannot use SIP unfortunatly, all the code examples found on the WEB are done by SIP. In the following the code I written, but it doesnt work I tested with 2 devices one receiving and the other trasmitting but I cannot hear anything.  Why The problem is the multicast IP Ill really appreciate  first of all the solution to use my below code if it is not available, Ill appreciate any suggestion about other solutionsclassesetc... and example codes in order to get my target chat PTT not using SIPp  pMY CODE BELOW  Firts the class RTPVoIPManager, where are implemented the 2 methods for receiving and transmit.

Negative 62083 pI am running redisserver in a Docker container on Ubuntu 14.10 x64. If I access the redis database via phpRedisAdmin, do a few edits and then get them to be saved to disk, shutdown the container and then restart it everything is fine  the edited redis keys are present and correct.  However, if I edit keys and then shut down the container then restart it the edits do not stick.  p  pClearly, the dump.rdb file is not being saved automatically when the container is shutdown.  I imagine that I could fix this by putting in an etcinit.d script that is symlinked from etcrc6.d.  However, I am wondering  why does shutting down a redis container not perform an orderly shutdown of the running processes in the container  After all, when I reboot my server both the server amp the container run Ubuntu 14.10 I do not have to explicitly commit the redis db changes to disk.p

Negative 62083 pI have deployed a Dalvik virtual machine in a server. Now, I can execute code from console like this.p  precodepublic class Foo    public static void main String[] args       System.out.printlnSystem.currentTimeMillis         System.out.printlnHere we do smt       System.out.printlnSystem.currentTimeMillis           javac Foo.java   dx dex outputfoo.jar Foo.class   .rund.sh cp foo.jar Foo codepre  pI have wrapped this process into a service, in such a way that any client can push code for execution in the server using WebSockets.p  pCase 1 Everything is fine when requests are schedule to be push at the same time lets say concurrently or short inter arrival time. For instance, three requests reach the server, and the server schedules them for execution immediately.  The execution time of these three requests is around 3 seconds.p  pCase 2 The problem arises when the requests do not arrive at the same time long inter arrival time. For example, lets say the server is processing two requests, and then the next one arrives. In this case, the execution time increases significantly. The execution time of the first two requests increases to 10 seconds, and the third one up to 15 seconds.p  pI understand that in the second case, the resources of the server are busy when the last request arrives, but, I dont quite get, why the execution time degrades like that. Its the Dalvik machine too heavy but in that case, how can process case 1 so fastp  pAny insights about how to explain this behavior will be grateful, thanks.p

Negative 62083 pI am creating a program that will read a word from a text file in main.c, and send it over to list.c file to create a new node to store that word. The node will also store three ints first number of times this word appears in txt file 1, secondnumber of times this word appears in txt file 2, and dif absfirstsecond. After adding all the new words to the file and counting the number of times each word exists in each txt file, the main.c will call a method that will calculate the difference between first and second for each node. This is difference stored in dif for each node will be used to sort the linked nodes in decreasing order. p  pEX. word the, first 2888, second 2466, dif 422.           red,        39            12         27           .....p  pHowever, when main calls the sort method, a infinite loop occurs. This infinite loop comes from the inner loop of the sorting algorithm, where the current node is assigned the node from the currnext pointer.

Negative 62083 pIm trying to wrap my head around proper API design in flask. My original design was to build an API blueprint that was a thin layer to bridge the URL endpoint to the actual API logic like below.p  precodeapi.routepostsltintidgt def getpostid     return apiLogic.getpostid codepre  pI assumed this would be the best way to design the API because if I needed to query a post from jQuery on the client, I could use the codepostsltintidgtcode endpoint. Additionally, if I needed to render a page with a specific post from the backend, my backend code could directly call apiLogic.getpostid without having to do a http request to codepostsltintidgtcode essentially sending an HTTP request to itself.p  pHowever, I believe that since the API is a blueprint, I can not directly call codeapiLogic.getpostidcode in the backend and retain the blueprintbeforerequest authorization checks since Im not calling this function through the blueprint per se. p  pI could resolve this problem by not calling the functions directly and instead using an http request when my backend wants to get a post, but is that bad design What is the best way to structure an API in flask that can be used both by the client and the serverp

Negative 62083 pIm looking in to a kindof binpacking problem, but not quite the same. The problem asks to put emnem items into minimum number of bins without total weight exceeding capacity of bins. classical definitionp  pThe difference is Each item has a emweightem and strongemboundemstrong, and the capacity of the bin is dynamically determined by the minimum emboundem of items in that bin. p  pE.g., I have four items A[11,12], B[1,10], C[3,4], D[20,22] em[weight,bound]em. Now, if I put item A into a bin, call it b1, then the capacity of b1 become 12. Now I try to put item B into b1, but failed because the total weight is 111 12, and the capacity of b1 become 10, which is smaller than total weight. So, B is put into bin b2, whose capacity become 10. Now, put item C into b2, because the total weight is 13 4, and the capacity of b2 become 4.p  pI dont know whether this question has been solved in some areas with some name. Or it is a variant of binpacking that has been discussed somewhere. I dont know whether this is the right place to post the question, any helps are appreciatedp

Lavoie codepre  pIf it helps below is the code I used as my starting point.p  precodeSub test  Dim cel As Variant Dim myCell As Variant Dim myrng As Range Dim myRange As Range Dim CellValue As Long  Set myrng  RangeG2G amp RangeG amp Rows.Count.EndxlUp.Row Set myRange  RangeD2D amp RangeD amp Rows.Count.EndxlUp.Row  For Each cel In myrng     If Application.WorksheetFunction.CountIfmyrng, cel gt 1 Then         For Each myCell In myRange             If Application.WorksheetFunction.CountIfmyRange, myCell  1        Then                 myCell.Offset0, 3.Interior.ColorIndex  6             End If         Next myCell     End If Next cel  End Sub codepre  pI should add that my current solution now is to separate the loops where one highlights all the column G dups then the second loop unhighlights where column D is duped.p

Negative 62083 pI am having a bit of trouble implementing Json Paylaods from a JIRA webhook in MVC VB.net because of the fields strongIssueTypestrong and strongPrioritystrong in JIRA.  the only time when the JSON payload will successfully enter is when the strongIssueType  Bugstrong and strongpriority  majorstrong.  p  pI am think that the problem lies with mismatching IDs of these two fields.  I found out that when the priority is strongmajorstrong its ID is 3.  When the IssueType is strongBugstrong its ID is 1.  I think that because in my companys JIRA application only has certain options to choose from these two fields e.g The Priority field cant choose fatal as an option so that ID is never chosen.  p  pSo my question is how to I correctly match up these two fields in my application.  At the moment In my table the Priority Table is as followsp  precodeID  Name 2  Critical 3  Major 4  Minor codepre  pThe IssueType Table is as followsp  precodeID  Name 1  Bug 2  Query codepre  pI am deserializing the Json like thisp  precode Dim r As System.IO.StreamReader  New System.IO.StreamReaderHttpContext.Request.InputStream  Dim json As String  r.ReadToEnd  Dim iss As object  JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectOf object json System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceErrorjson  codepre  pThen I am reading the Data into my Database using Entity Framework like thisp  precode Dim newIssue As New IssueResultTable  newIssue.issueKey  issue.issue.key  newIssue.status  issue.issue.fields.status.name  newIssue.IssueType  issue.issue.fields.issuetype.id  newIssue.Priority  issue.issue.fields.priority.id   Using db As New GartanIssueTrackerEntities  db.IssueResultTables.AddnewIssue  db.SaveChanges  End Using  Catch ex As Exception   End Try codepre  pI then display this information in my View but it only works with the examples I said above.  What is the correctly way to order these fields in the database, should it matter Or can it be any order or does it have to be the exact same as the JIRA fields that also includes all the fields from JIRA not just ones my application uses e.g Do I have to add Fatal as ID 1 to my tablep

Everything works well  I can load and edit the column values, and save changes to sqlite.  All of this is accomplished with bindings via Interface Builder.  I now want to add a new color column to this table, representing a relationship to another entity, say entity Color. Each row will have an NSPopUpButton for this new column the popup button should have its values populated from a second NSArrayController linked to the Color entity. Thus, color is a manytoone relationship between Car and Color many Cars can reference a given Color, and Id like the values in the popup button to correspond to the name property from Color.p  pWhat Ive donep  ul lipIn the storyboard under the controller scene containing the Car table, Ive added a second NSArrayController, Colors Array Controllerp  p1 under Attributes Inspector  Mode  Entity Name, Entity Name  Color, Prepares Content checkbox selectedp  p2 under Bindings Inspector  Parameters  Managed Object Context  Bind To checked  selected Cars Controller  Model Key Path  contextpli lipIn the Cars table under NSTableCellView, added an NSPopUpButton.pli ul  pAt this point, everything builds and runs properly, except that all the columns in the table show the Item 1 default value from the popup button I can also see the other default values when I expand the popup.p  pNow, Ive tried the following in a futile attempt to load the popup with the correct valuesp  pStrategy 1p  pusing Interface Builder, selected the NSPopUpButton.

Negative 62083 pIm surprised this hasnt been asked already unless it has, and I just couldnt find it.p  pRight now, Im using codegetComponentAtint x, int ycode for when a point is over a specific codeJComponentcode, but I would also like something along the lines of codegetClosestComponentToint x, int ycode for when the other method returns the codeJPanelcode container.p  pMy thought was that Id have to essentially search each point around the given point until codegetComponentAtcode returned something other than the codeJPanelcode, but that seems pretty resourceconsuming and unnecessary.p  pAny other ideasp

Negative 62083 pI have a PHP function that needs to be executed 10 seconds after certain events.p  pThe Function can in turn create a new instance of the event, which would need to trigger the function again 10 seconds later.p  pOften the function wont create a new event, but it will be possible for chains in length up to 1000. 10,000 sec Thus  I dont think its reasonable to contain the whole chain within a single sleeplooping php process. is this incorrectp  pAt any given time, there could be up to 100 separate instances of these eventfunction chains all running simultaneously.p  pIve been doing lots of research on reactphp  systemdaemon  pcntl  fakeforking with exec and other potential solutions. Wondering what the best solution for this sort of problem could be.p  pIll also need some way to catch broken chains or timedout longprocesses, to try to restart them within the 10 second window.p  pThanks very much in advance.p
