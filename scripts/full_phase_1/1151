This may not be strictly correct as SQL server has some mechanism to optimize this process, something regarding chosing one smaller table as inner table to loop the outer table as I remember correctly for the codeONcode condition.

Negative 1151 pHow do large web sites which cannot be completely stateless achieve extreme scalability at the web tierp  pThere are sites like ebay and Amazon, which cannot be completely stateless, as they have a shopping cart or something like that. It isnt feasible to encode every item in the shopping cart into the URL, nor is it feasible to encode every item into a cookie and send it at every connection. So Amazon simply stores the sessionid into the cookie which is being sent. So I understand that the scalability of the web tier of ebay and Amazon should be much harder than the scalability of the google search engine, where everything can be encoded restful into the URL. p  pOn the other hand, both ebay as well as Amazon scaled absolutely massively. Rumor is that there are some 15000 J2EE Application Servers at ebay.p  pHow do these sites handle both extreme scalability and statefulness As the site is stateful, it isnt feasible to do a simple DNSBalancing. So one would assume that these companies have a hardware based load balancer like BigIP, Netscaler or something like that, which is the sole device behind the single IP adress of that site. This load balancer would decrypt the SSL if encoded, inspect the cookie and decide depending on the session id of that cookie which application server holds the session of that customer.p  pBut this just cant possibly work as no single loadbalancer could possibly handle the load of thousands of apoplication servers I would imagine that even these hardware load balancers do not scale to such a level.p  pAlso, the loadbalancing is being done transparantly for the user, i.e. the users are not forwarded to different addresses, but still all collectively stay at www.amazon.com the whole time.p  pSo my question is Is there some special trick with which one can achieve something like transparent sharding of the web tier not the database tier as done commonly As long as the cookie isnt inspected there is no way to know which application server is holding this session.p  pstrongEditstrong I realized that there is only a need for transparency, if there is a need for the site to be spidered and bookmarked. E.g. if the site is a mere web app, something like a plane or train ticket reservation system, there should be no problem with just redirecting the users to specific clusters of web servers behind different urls, e.g. a17.ticketreservation.com. In this specific case, it would be feasible to just use multiple clusters of application servers, each behind his own load balancer. Interestingly, I did not find a site which uses this kind of concept. strongEditstrong I found this concept a hrefhttphighscalability.comsaveloadbalancerusingclientsideloadbalancing relnofollowdiscusseda at a hrefhttphighscalability.com relnofollowhighscalability.coma, where the discussion refers to an article by Lei Zhu named stronga hrefhttpwww.digitalweb.comarticlesclientsideloadbalancing relnofollowClient Side Load Balancing for Web 2.0 Applicationsastrong. Lei Zhu uses cross scripting to do this client side load balancing transparently.p  pEven if there are drawbacks, like bookmarking, xss, etc, I do think that this sounds like a extremely good idea for certain special situations, namely almost contentfree web applications, which are not needed to be spidered or bookmarked e.g. ticket reservation systems or something like that. Then there is no need to do the load balancing transparently.p  pThere could be a simple redirect from the main site to the server, e.g. a redirect from www.ticketreservation.com to a17.ticketreservation.com. From there on the user stays at the server a17. a17 is not a server, but a cluster itself, by which redundancy could be achieved.p  pThe initial redirect server could itself be a cluster behind a load balancer. This way, a really high scalability could be achieved, as the primary load balancer behind www is only hit once at the beginning of each session.p  pOf course, the redirect to different urls looks extremely nasty, but with mere web applications which do not need to be spidered, deeplinked or deepbookmarked anyway, this should be only an optical problem for the userp  pThe redirectcluster could poll the load of the application clusters and adapt the redirects accordingly, thus achieving balancing and not mere load distribution.p

Negative 1151 pSorry, I thought this was an inheritance question it was an ArrayList question all alongp  pOk, my problem is more specific than I thought. So I have two families of classes.

Further subclasses, such as Hand, and PokerHand, have their own specific ways of dealing with the cards they store. p  pWhere it gets complicated is that Card also has subClasses, such as PokerCard, and that the subclasses of ZoneList and ZoneMap are meant to organize those. p  pSo in ZoneList I have codeprotected ArrayListltCardgt cardBoxcode and in PokerHand I expected to be able to declare codecardBox  new ArrayListltPokerCardgtcode since PokerCard is a Card. The error I am getting is that I apparently cant cast between Card and GangCard when it comes to ArrayLists... So I was trying to fix this by just redeclaring cardBox as codeprivate ArrayListltPokerCardgt cardBoxcode inside PokerHand, but that resulted in the hiding that was bugging up my program.p  pSO really, the question is about casting between ArrayLists Java tells me I cant, so any ideas on how I canp  pz.p

Negative 1151 pSo, my question is, can any of the ASP.NET Ajax controls from the a hrefhttpwww.asp.netAJAXAjaxControlToolkitSamplesDefault.aspx relnofollowControl Toolkita be used without their serverside controls and without an ASP.NET Ajax ScriptManager. p  pFor reference, I am asking in the context of an ASP.NET MVC application.p  pClearly, some of the controls dont make sense in this model because they do postbacks to the server in order to accomplish their work e.g. Autocomplete, CascadingDropDown, etc.p  pHowever, several of the controls would be interesting to use from nonASP.NET Web Forms applications.  For example, Id really like to use the a hrefhttpwww.asp.netAJAXAjaxControlToolkitSamplesCalendarCalendar.aspx relnofollowCalendara control in one of my projects.  But my curiosity is broader than just the Calendar control, so Id be interested if there is a general way to use these in pure client mode.p  pIf this is possible, can you point me at any examples or resources on how to do itp  pYes, I know there are alternatives like the calendar control in JQuery UI, but for consistency with other, nonMVC projects that already exist, Id prefer to use the Microsoft calendar control.p

Negative 1151 pI have some performance issues in my JavaScript, and Im not having much success instrumenting it.  One of the things Ive tried is using firebugs profile tool.  It reports that the top single call was to dojos log.  Unhelpfully, it reports a line number from the compressed script, so I cant tell whats causing the problem.

Is there a way to turn off dojo loggingp  pThe only visible logging is an entry that shows up every 1.5 seconds and that appears to be a keep alive for comet.

An entry in codeversionedentitycode can be identified by its foreign key and codeversioncode there can be many versions having same codefkBasicEntityIdcode. codeactiveversioncode is a number pointing to one of codeversionedentitycode entries and tells which version is active. Hope thats clear enough.p  pNow the problem I am solving is that I need quick access in Java like thisp  precodemy.BasicEntity basic  my.BasicEntityDAO.get my.VersionedEntity activeVersion  basic.getActiveVersionedEntity codepre  pThe current implementation is done in Java and simply iterates over all versioned entities of given basic entity and checks if its version matches with active version. Needless to say, this doesnt scale and results performance problems.p  pSo I went on to move this onto database level. Looks easy So I thought I went on and added following into Hibernate mapping of basicentityp  precodeltmanytoone nameactiveVersionedEntity notnullfalse insertfalse updatefalsegt   ltcolumn nameid uniquetrue notnulltruegt   ltcolumn nameactiveVersiongt ltmanytoonegt codepre  pThe double column is required here for codeversionedentitycode has composite key. Unfortunately, this doesnt work  JVM dies without a trace when a call to codebe.getActiveVersionedEntitycode is invoked on colleagues machine it throws StackOverflowError inside Hibernate. I suspect this happens because id is also an identifier, as I have very similar mapping for the same class where column is not an identifier and this works correctly.p  pI could probably do this with HQL, but that would require me to move this method into the DAO class which is particularly awkward as would require changes in API not an option. Using DAO call inside codemy.BasicEntitygetActiveVersionedEntitycode is another big nono I cant mix up different abstraction layers. Another way of solving this would be looking into Interceptorsevents, however this also probably one of those options which beat the purpose of the framework I shouldnt care about low level things like this, do I.p  pI am running Hibernate version 3.2.7GA  Spring 2.5.6. The documentation is unbelievably poor  I have looked at three different Hibernate books, online documentation, forums, etc.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 1151 pIve written several copy functions in search of a good memory strategy on PowerPC. Using the Altivec or fp registers with cache hints dcb doubles the performance over a simple byte copy loop for large data. Initially pleased with that, I threw in a regular memcpy to see how it compared... 10x faster than my best I have no intention of rewriting memcpy, but I do hope to learn from it and accelerate several simple image filters that spend most of their time moving pixels to and from memory.p  pShark analysis reveals that their inner loop uses dcbt to prefetch, with 4 vector reads, then 4 vector writes. After tweaking my best function to also haul 64 bytes per iteration, the performance advantage of memcpy is still embarrassing.

Negative 1151 pLong story short, I am trying to build a very bare bones UDP SKB just to get something onto the wire.  The scenario is as followsp  pI have a kernel module loading that among other things overrides the memory location of the standard udpsendmsg function in netipv4udp.c.  From here I would like to construct an skb to the point where I can simply put it onto the wire.  Normally, udpsendmsg simply does a little UDP bookkeeping, tacks on a UDP header and sends it down to the IP layer for routing, L3L2 headers etc.  Basically I am bringing some of that functionality up into the sendmsg function.  At this time, I am just allocating an skbp  precode    skb  allocskb1500, GFPKERNEL     skb has 1500 bytes of tail room only     skbreserveskb, 500     now has head and tail but no data space     data  skbputskb, 500     now we have an skb with 500 head, 500 data sec, 500 tail codepre  pAnd then after some route table seteup I am trying to add a udphdrp  precode    struct udphdr uh     skbgttransportheader  skbpushskb, sizeofstruct udphdr     uh  udphdrskb     uhgtsource  5555     uhgtdest  dport     uhgtlen   18     uhgtcheck  0 codepre  pand an iphdr only the basics filledp  precode    struct iphdr iph     skbgtnetworkheader  skbpushskb, sizeofstruct iphdr     iph  iphdrskb     iphgtversion  4     iphgtihl  5     iphgttos  inetgttos     iphgttotlen  htonsskbgtlen     iphgtprotocol  IPPROTOUDP     iphgtsaddr  saddr     iphgtdaddr  daddr     skbgtdst  dstcloneamprtgtu.dst codepre  pNote I got most of this stuff from a hrefhttpvger.kernel.orgdavemskbdata.html relnofollowthis pagea but they are using an older kernel pre 2.6.24 where the network and transport headers were unions and called nh and h respectively.

Negative 1151 pI have tried my best to answer this question myself through research but I am still a little bit worried about whether I am using the right thing. Basically I am using the DomDocument Library to build a jQuery like theme parser for my framework. Now with the web as it is today HTML is coming in different shapes and sizes e.g HTML 4, HTML 5, XHTML, XHTML 5 etc ... The issue that I am finding with DomDocument is that if you give it HTML code it will only work with it if it is standards compliant XHTML. I know it can convert it into XHTML and I can use the tidy library to make the code acceptable but my main worry is what if a developer using my framework has a theme that uses all the cooldebatable new HTML 5 features, as soon as he passes it to my framework it will either throw a tantrum or convert it down to XHTML which would suck.p  pSo my question is Is DomDocument the most convenient library for what I needp  porp  pIs there a way of getting it to work with all the different variants of HTMLp

Is it good programming practice to simply use one, or in this case two working methods to implement the restp  pMy implementation for those methods is as followsp  precode NSComparisonMethods Protocol Methods BOOLisEqualToFraction f     [self reduce]     [f reduce]     return self.numeratorf.numeratorampampself.denominatorf.denominator  BOOLisLessThanFraction f     return [self comparef]1  BOOLisLessThanOrEqualToFraction f     return  [self comparef]1  [self isEqualTof]   BOOLisGreaterThanFraction f     return  [self comparef]1   BOOLisGreaterThanOrEqualToFraction f     return  [self comparef]1  [self isEqualTof]   BOOLisNotEqualToFraction f     return [self isEqualTof]  codepre  pAnd my compare function is as followsp  precodeintcompareFraction f     int value  [self gcddenominator f.denominator]     if [self isEqualTof]          return 0      else if numerator  f.denominatorvaluegtf.numerator  denominatorvalue          return 1      else          return 1       codepre  pAll these functions are kind of redundant and I am sure there are different ways to implement them. I remember that back in the day professors used to make students do everything as if it were from scratch, but, doesnt that go against the reusing code mentality we all should havep
Negative 1151 pI want to develop an app thats able to print all of the data exchanged on a COM port both ways without blocking the port, so that others apps can use it normally.p  pAfter some research Ive found DataReceivedEvent, but I think that youve to be the owner of the port in order to use it. What I need its something like that, but for data received and sended, without owning the port.p  pIs there a wayp

Negative 1151 pMy starting point is the followingbr  I have a method, transform, which I overloaded to behave differently depending on the type of arguments that are passed in see  transformA a1, A a2 and transformA a1, B b  in my example belowbr  All these arguments implement the same interface, Xp  pI would like to apply that transform method on various objects all implementing the X interface.p  pWhat I came up with was to implement transformX x1, X x2, which checks for the instance of each object before applying the relevant variant of my transform.p  pThough it works, the code seems ugly and I am also concerned of the performance overhead for evaluating these various instanceof and casting.  Is that  transform the best I can do in Java or is there a more elegant andor efficient way of achieving the same behaviorp  pBelow is a trivial, working example printing out BA.

Negative 1151 pIve got a server side protocol that controls a telephony system, Ive already implemented a client library that communicates with it which is in production now, however there are some problems with the system I have at the moment, so I am considering rewriting it.p  pMy client library is currently written in Java but I am thinking of rewriting it in both C and Java to allow for different clients to have access to the same back end.p  pThe messages start with a keyword have a number of bytes of meta data and then some data. The messages are always terminated by an end of message character.p  pCommunication is duplex between the client and the server usually taking the form of a request from the Client which provokes several responses from the server, but can be notifications.  The messages are marked as being on ofp  pC Commandp  pP Pending server is still handling the requestp  pD Data data as a response to  p  pR Responsep  pB Busy Server is too busy to handle response at the momentp  pN Notificationp  pMy current architecture has each message being parsed and a thread spawned to handle it, however Im finding that some of the Notifications are processed out of order which is causing me some trouble as they have to be handled in the same order they arrive.p  pThe duplex messages tend to take the following message format Client  Server Command Server  Client Pending Optional Server  Client Data optional Server  Client Response 2nd entry in message data denotes whether this is an error or notp  pIve been using the protocol for over a year and Ive never seen the a busy message but that doesnt mean they dont happen.p  pThe server can also send notifications to the client, and there are a few Response messages that are auto triggered by events on the server so they are sent without a corresponding Command being issued.p  pSome Notification Messages will arrive as part of sequence of messages, which are related for examplep  pNotificationName  M00001  NotificationName  M00001  NotificationName  M00000p  pThe string M0000X means that either there is more data to come or that this is the end of the messages.p  pAt present the tcp client is fairly dumb it just spawns a thread that notifies an event on a subscriber that the message has been received, the event is specific to the message keyword and the type of message So data,Responses and Notifications are handled separately this works fairly effectively for Data and response messages, but falls over with the notification messages as they seem to arrive in rapid sequence and a race condition sometimes seems to cause the Message end to be processed before the ones that have the data are processed, leading to lost message data.p  pGiven this really badly written description of how the system works how would you go about writing the client side transport codep  pThe meta data does not have a message number, and I have not control over the underlying protocol as its provided by a vendor.p

The philosophical problem with that approach is replication, in that if I change a relationship in the database, then rerun propelgen THEN I also have to update my hydration functions to mirror that change in structure.  It seems like all the pieces should be there to allow for skipping that last step and remove the replication.p  pFor example, with the small specificcase hydration function above, All Im doing is calling the getWHATEVER helper functions based on the knowledge in my head that heroskill relates to both hero and skill, and when I get a hero I want to check heroskill and get the corresponding skill list.  Propel knows about these relations as well due to the Foreign Keys, and when using joinWith it is even aware of recursion sets recursive object refs to a string value of RECURSION, so the pieces are all in place for Propel to intelligently autohydrate these objects while gracefully resolvingignoring recursion, I just cant find the proper syntax to make that happen.  p  pie get an Object, resolve its FK relations, hydrate all child Objects rows in related tables by FK and exclude recursive Objects.p  pI guess what Im looking for is a way to completely abstract the datastore, take advantage of Propels class generation ability based on database schema.xml definitions and thus not have to custom write a bunch of helper functions that may be subject to change if data structure changes.   Thus allowing me to code in terms of Objects and not Database records, isnt that the whole point of an ORMp  pI hope that clarifies a bit, thanksp

A common test case to reproduce the crash is use the app, snap photos which triggers processing, launch sub activities, etc over and over again.  Back out of the app, fire up something resourcegraphics heavy, and then resume my app.p  pHere is some logcat output at the time of the crashp  precode0329 142002.109 ERRORdalvikvm6368 externalAllocPossible footprint 2756592  extAlloc 15831356  n 8640000 gt max 22409232 space for 3821284 0329 142002.109 ERRORdalvikvmheap6368 8640000byte external allocation too large for this process. 0329 142002.109 ERRORdalvikvm6368 Out of memory Heap Size3835KB, Allocated2835KB, Bitmap Size15460KB, Limit21884KB 0329 142002.109 ERRORdalvikvm6368 Trim info Footprint5383KB, Allowed Footprint5383KB, Trimmed1548KB 0329 142002.109 ERRORGraphicsJNI6368 VM wont let us allocate 8640000 bytes codepre  pMy activity is logging at every step, so this happens in Activity.onCreate in between calling super.onCreate and setting the context view to my xml layout.

It either has to do with my own app not cleaning up after itself enough, or the system not being able to reclaim memory fast enough for my app.  What I dont understand is why during setContentView is it attempting to allocate so much new memory.p  pHere is my surface callback code and a paraphrase of what goes on in the activityp  precodepublic void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.camerapreview       crash occurs here       ...other stuff      initControls   private void initControls             previewHolder  preview.getHolder     previewHolder.addCallbacksurfaceCallback     previewHolder.setTypeSurfaceHolder.SURFACETYPEPUSHBUFFERS       ...other stuff    SurfaceHolder.Callback surfaceCallback  new Callback       public void surfaceDestroyedSurfaceHolder holder          Log.dApplicationEx.LogTag, surfaceDestroyed         camera.stopPreview         camera.release         camera  null         isPreviewRunning  false           public void surfaceCreatedSurfaceHolder holder          Log.dApplicationEx.LogTag, surfaceCreated         camera  Camera.open          try                      camera.setPreviewDisplaypreviewHolder                  catchThrowable t                              public void surfaceChangedSurfaceHolder holder, int format, int width, int height              Log.dApplicationEx.LogTag, surfaceChanged         if isPreviewRunning                      Log.dApplicationEx.LogTag, preview is running, stop preview             camera.stopPreview             isPreviewRunning  false                  Camera.Parameters parameters  camera.getParameters         setPreviewAndPictureSizeparameters, width, height         parameters.setPictureFormatPixelFormat.JPEG         parameters.setJpegQuality85         camera.setParametersparameters         camera.startPreview         isPreviewRunning  true         Log.dApplicationEx.LogTag, end surfaceChanged        codepre

Negative 1151 pI would like to create custom VPN application based on OpenVPN for Android OS.

Negative 1151 pIm a big fan of speeding up my builds using make j8 replacing 8 with whatever my current computers number of cores is, of course, and compiling N files in parallel is usually very effective at reducing compile times... unless some of the compilation processes are sufficiently memoryintensive that the computer runs out of RAM, in which case all the various compile processes start swapping each other out, and everything slows to a crawl  thus defeating the purpose of doing a parallel compile in the first place.p  pNow, the obvious solution to this problem is buy more RAM  but since Im too cheap to do that, it occurs to me that it ought to be possible to have an implementation of make or equivalent that watches the systems available RAM, and when RAM gets down to near zero and the system starts swapping, make would automatically step in and send a SIGSTOP to one or more of the compile processes it had spawned.  That would allow the stopped processes to get fully swapped out, so that the other processes could finish their compile without further swapping then, when the other processes exit and more RAM becomes available, the make process would send a SIGCONT to the paused processes, allowing them to resume their own processing.  That way most swapping would be avoided, and I could safely compile on all cores.p  pIs anyone aware of a program that implements this logic  Or conversely, is there some good reason why such a program wouldntcouldnt workp

Negative 1151 pIve googled and read, and Im trying to find a correct way to do it, but every question I read on SO seems to have completely different answers.p  pHere is the gist of my problem.  files has the type signature of a seq of a triple astring, bstring,cInt64.  Being new to f Im still not fluent in expressing type signatures or for that matter understanding them.  a is a filename, b is an internal identifier, and c is a value representing the length size of the file.  baseconfig is a string from earlier in the code.p  precodeignorefiles      gt Seq.filter funx,y,z gt  y  baseconfig   used to filter only files we want     gt Seq.fold fun f n   gt          if fun ,,z gt z n gt 50L1024L1024L then             zipfilex.Addfun zstring, ,  gt z n             printfnAdding 50mb to zip             zipfilex.CommitUpdate             zipfilex.BeginUpdate             ,,0L         else             zipfilex.Addfun z, ,  gt z n             , , fun , , zInt64 gt z n  fun , , zInt64 gt z f      ,,0L      codepre  pWhat this chunk of code is supposed to do, is iterate through each file in codefilescode, add it to a zip archive but not really, it just goes on a list to be committed later, and when the files exceed 50MB, commit the currently pending files to the zip archive.  Adding a file is cheap, committing is expensive, so I try to mitigate the cost by batching it. p  pSo far the code kinda works... Except for the ObjectDisposedException I got when it approached 150MB of committed files.  But Im not sure this is the right way to do such an operation.  It feels like Im using codeSeq.foldcode in a unconventional way, but yet, I dont know of a better way to do it.p  pBonus question Is there a better way to snipe values out of tuples  fst and snd only work for 2 valued tuples, and I realize you can define your own functions instead of inline them like I did, but it seems there should be a better way.p  pUpdate  My previous attempts at fold, I couldnt understand why I couldnt just use an Int64 as an accumulator.  Turns out I was missing some critical parenthesis.  Little simpler version below.  Also eliminates all the crazy tuple extraction.p  precodeignorefoundoldfiles      gt Seq.filter fun x,y,z gt  y  baseconfig      gt Seq.fold fun a f,g,j   gt          zipfilex.Add f         if a gt 50L1024L1024L then             printfnAdding 50mb to zip             zipfilex.CommitUpdate             zipfilex.BeginUpdate             0L         else              a  j      0L      codepre  pstrikestrongUpdate 2strong  Im going to have to go with an imperative solution, F is somehow reentering this block of code, after the zip file is closed in the statement which follows it.  Which explains the ObjectDisposedException.  No idea how that works or why.strikep

Negative 1151 pRight. Ive spent over three hours today trying to understand why you cant call a bios ISR when in protected mode.

But I still dont get why cant you jsut create a single 4GB segment, map your IDT segments to the BIOS IVT, set everything in ring 0 and call them. Shouldnt that work p  pMost articles either say Remember you cant use BIOS interrupts in protected mode without exploring the subject or are extremely descriptive and cite traps, exceptions, pics remmaping, lack of rights and problems with segment registers as the reason behind it. p  pIt would be extremely helpful if someone could come up with a more humanfriendly explanation...

And fourth tab is like second tab but with other content.p  pIn every viewDidLoad Method I wrote something to console like [currentview] was loaded and currentview was replaced with an identifying name for the view which was loaded.br If I start my App on iPhone then the console shows me that without any user interaction the first tab and the third tab both UINavigationController both were loaded. In detail the third tab was loaded before the first tab.br If I start my App in iPad then only the first tab is loaded like it should have to be. Except for implementing NIB files targeted for iPad I use the same source code at the beginning of my App.p  pIn AppDelegateiPhone.m I only add the UITabBarController.view as a subview to window.

Negative 1151 pI have a very specific issue when using a UINavigationController within a UIPopoverController, involving interactions between the popover, the keyboard, and perhaps UITableView.  I will attempt to simplify this as much as possible from the actual situation, but it is still rather detailed.p  pTHE ISSUE I present a popover, which has a UINavigationController as its contentView, and at the root of the navigation controller is viewControllerA.  ViewControllerA contains a UITableView but no keyboard responders.  When user selects a tableCell on viewControllerA, viewControllerB is spawned and is pushed to the stack.  ViewControllerB contains UITextFields, so the keyboard appears and autoresizes the popover while in Landscape orientation.  After user response, viewControllerB is popped off the navigation stack revealing viewControllerA.  The keyboard disappears and the popover gets autoresized back to its proper height for viewControllerA.  However now several of viewControllerAs tableCells no longer respond to touch.p  pThis nonresponsive area seems to be exactly the height of the full popover when it is showing viewControllerB after the keyboard has forced it to resize.  But strangely it doesnt start from the top of the popover  it starts below the table header.  ViewControllerAs table can contain quite a few cells, and if I touch cells below this region, they still spawn viewControllerB.  Likewise if if touch the table header.p  pI know this is related to UIPopoverController because this is a universal app and these same view controllers are presented on the iPhone and in a separate location on the iPad not in popover and this issue only appears when in the popover.p  pI know this is keyboard related because 1 when the keyboard doesnt appear on viewControllerB and I pop back to viewControllerA, there is no issue and 2 when they keyboard does appear on viewControllerB, then I manually hide the keyboard via the keyboard button, and then pop back to viewControllerA after the keyboard is completely hidden and the popover has resized, there is no issue.p  pI know this is related to the keyboard auto resizing the popover controller because when the popover is presented when in the Portrait orientation, it does not get resized by the keyboard.  While the keyboard is still on screen I can pop back to viewControllerA and there is no issue.p  pIve tried what I think are all of the obvious things.p  p1 I have a base view controller class where I can change things for all of my view controllers.  In the base view controller, in viewWillAppearanimated, I set the contentSizeForViewInPopover propertyp  precodeif self.isPresentedInPopover     self.contentSizeForViewInPopover  CGSizeMake320.0, 480.0 codepre  p2 also in the base view controller, in viewWillDisappearanimated, I hide the keyboardp  precode voidhideKeyboard       hide keyboard     BOOL didResignFirstResponder  [self.view endEditingYES]  codepre  p3 In the view which presents the popover, I implement the UINavigationControllerDelegate method navigationControllerdidShowViewControlleranimated, where I set the popoverContentSize property of the UIPopoverControllerp  precode voidnavigationControllerUINavigationControllernavigationController didShowViewControllerUIViewControllerviewController animatedBOOLanimated      if navigationController  myPopover.contentViewController         my.popoverContentSize  CGSizeMake320.0, 480.0       also tried setting this after a delay  didnt work  codepre  pI have verified that all of these things are doing what they are supposed to do, but I still get the nonresponsive area.  What happens is the keyboard DOES hide while viewControllerB is still on the screen, but the popover does not resize until AFTER viewControllerA is already shown.  For this to work, what I think NEEDS to happen is the keyboard needs to hide AND it needs to resize the popover BEFORE it pops viewControllerB off the stack.p  pAfter days of battling this issue, I found a solution.  Its a bit lame though, so I was hoping someone could come up with something better.p  pThe only thing that worked for me was this.  Normally in the button action for popping viewControllerB, all I do is pop the viewController and log that the user tapped a button.  Now for viewControllerB only, if I detect it is being presented in a popover, I first immediately hide the keyboard.  Then I do the pop using a performSelectorwithObjectafterDelay.  The delay length doesnt much seem to matter, as it wont pop the viewController until the animation for hiding the keyboard is finished.p  precode voidactionFinishedWithThisControlleridsender      if self.isPresentedInPopover              [self hideKeyboard]         [super performSelectorselectorbackBarItemTapped withObjectsender afterDelay0.05]          else              [super backBarItemTappedsender]       codepre  pIt works and its fairly simple, but I hate forcing delays into the UI.  Maybe there some better way to do thisp  pUPDATE I am presenting the popover from a rectangle as the action did not come from a UIBarButtonItem.  The issue Im having isnt related to device rotation, but the information provided by titaniumdecoy is still useful.  It did occur to me to simply hide the popover and present it again, but viewControllerA, which is the one I would need to represent, is holding on to some user data that doesnt get saved until a Done button is tapped.  Essentially what is in the popover is a contact.  ViewControllerA shows the info for a single contact, and while it is in edit mode it can spawn an instance of viewControllerB for the user to edit some single piece of the contacts info.  Until the user taps a Done button to save the changes on viewControllerA, all of the info in that editing session is temporary.  Now that I am writing this out I realize that I dont like that behavior, so I may change the app to save each piece of data as the user enters it.  That seems more Applelike and also gives me the option to hide and represent the popover if I choose.  Guess I just needed to talk it out  thanksp

Negative 1151 pIm looking for a way to easily save the browsing history of the user that visited my website, after leaving the website that is. While saving this, I want to link pages together that were both visited during the session of the user. This way I can get the correlation between different pages. p  pThe reason I want to save the data at the end of the session is strongperformancestrong. I dont want the overhead of writing in tables emwith possible heavy indexingem with every pageload. Also saving at the end of the session emor after leaving the siteem has the advantage that search engine spiders emwho dont have statesessionem can be easily filtered out emthey will allways have no more than one page in session historyem.p  blockquote   pSidenote Im using the Yii framework in PHP 5.3 for my website.p blockquote  pI thought of a couple of solutions for my problemp  ol lipMake an ajax request in codeonbeforeunloadcode while user is leaving the site. p  pI check if the user stays on the site by setting a variable in each codeonclickcode event on an codeltagtcode that has a codehrefcode attribute that links to an internal page. The javascript method for this is unfortunately not foolproof, because of the browsers back and forward buttons emwhich do not set this variableem. Has the added benefit that the session data is normally available during this last ajax request.pli lipWrite my own Session Handlerp  pThis would be the more cumbersome solution. I havent used a custom session handler in Yii yet and I am a little unsure if I can for example easily load and process expired session data before it is deleted in the overridden a hrefhttpwww.yiiframework.comdocapi1.1CHttpSessiongcSessiondetail relnofollowgcSessiona function. Also this method could be fired when a new user enters the website, leaving him with the added loading time for processing multiple session histories at once emwhich I like to preventem.pli lipUse a scheduled task  cron yobp  pThis has the benefits of both but has the risk of using a lot of CPU resources. I also suspect that this would need a lot of extra handling. For this solution I would still want to use the Yii framework and if possible the same application context to execute the cron yob.pli ol  pI would really appreciate any information that can help me make a choice between the above solution. Maybe Ive overlooked a solution or a possibility I would really like to fire an event at a set timeout in PHP, while not making the user wait as with codesleepcode for example. All in all I believe asynchronous execution in PHP initiated from a single synchronous request is what Im looking for. Any suggestionsp

Negative 1151 pSo I have this really weird issue with certain xmlfiles and its really starting to annoy me. Eclipse is telling me some xmlfiles contain errors, but simply resaving the files by adding extra space or something fixes the error, whatever the error was. This happends every time I start eclipse.p  pIt says on the folder that theres error inside the folders that contain the xmlfiles giving errors, but the error icon on the file itself just shows for a split second after I expand the folder list. So I have to remember every time what names the xmlfiles with the problems had. p  pThe error that seems to pop up in most of these xmlfiles is Premature end of file. But like I said, simply resaving the file after adding an extra space or something, removes the error from the file, until I start eclipse the next time.p  pBut Ive also had other errors that are just a problem when eclipse starts. p  pIve tried cleaning the project several times, but it doesnt help.p  pDo someone have an idea what could cause this odd behaviourp

Negative 1151 pThis is a curious one.p  pI have an IBOutlet UIScrollView codeplayScrollViewcode whose height is exactly 13 of its contentSizes height. The app is in landscape. I call this code...p  precode[playScrollView scrollRectToVisibleCGRectMake0.0f, page  PLAYVIEWPAGEHEIGHT,                                               480.0, PLAYVIEWPAGEHEIGHT                            animatedanimated] codepre  p... the int codepagecode ranges from 0 to 2 to start on codepagecode 1 displaying the middle third then go up or down as needed when the user presses buttons.p  pThis works fine for iOS4 both device and simulator, and has been live on the app store for months with no problems. Even iOS5 devices are fine with existing builds, it was only when the app was recompiled for iOS5 that it stopped working correctly on iOS5 devices.p  pSince updating to XCode 4.2, This doesnt work for iOS5. It goes one codepagecode too low, showing the bottom page when it should show the middle. I can get the code to work for iOS5 device and simulator by changing codepagecode to codepage1code...p  precode[playScrollView scrollRectToVisibleCGRectMake0.0f, page1  PLAYVIEWPAGEHEIGHT,                                               480.0, PLAYVIEWPAGEHEIGHT                            animatedanimated] codepre  p...but of course this breaks iOS4, which works fine with the old code, but gets stuck one codepagecode too emhighem with this new code. iOS4 and iOS5 are exactly codePLAYVIEWPAGEHEIGHTcode outofstep 288 pixels, a third of the height of codeplayScrollViewcode. The same thing happens if I use codesetContentOffsetcode instead.p  pOne other curious thing, probably the key to this. If I dont do the scrollRectToVisible at all, then iOS4 sits at the top of playScrollView, wheras iOS5 shows the middle third, ie PLAYVIEWPAGEHEIGHT pixels down.p  pI emcouldem detect the iOS and use different code for each, but thats a horrible kludge. If its an iOS5 bug and they fix it in a future release, that would break the live app.p  pHas anyone any ideas, or noticed anything similar Thanks.p

Negative 1151 pI have had an app on the Android marketplace with inapp credit purchase ability for many months now. Our 1 issue is users who successfully complete their unmanaged purchase and are billed, but for whatever reason my client app is not recording it to our servers. This doesnt happen 100 of the time, most purchases are executed successfully, and we have very agressive retry logic if a successful purchase cant be uploaded to the server due to connectivity issues or whatever.p  pRecently we witnessed a scenario where an inapp purchase of an unmanaged item was made, but the onRequestPurchaseResponse method defined in the sample code a hrefhttpcode.google.compmarketbillingsourcebrowsesrccomexampledungeonsPurchaseObserver.java relnofollowPurchaseObserver.javaa, on which our code is based, was not actually called for over 60 seconds. p  pMy suspicion now is that in these cases where successful purchases are not uploaded to our servers, onRequestPurchaseResponse is either never called or the user exits the app before the notification happens because it is so delayed.p  pI now show a ProgressDialog every time onResume is called after the user returns from the Android Marketplace app, to prevent users from navigating away too quickly and thereby preventing us from recording the purchase. p  pCan anyone tell me if there are any known bugs involving either delayed or missing notifications from the Android Marketplace app after a successful purchase, and if so, what workarounds you have deployed p

Negative 1151 pNote Im aware about the disadvantages of using codeBinaryFormattercode in large files. But this is a homework for my friend  p  p.Net Framework 4I have created a simple codePersoncode class which should be serialized and written in a binary file.  p  ul liFor insertion, heres how it goes OpenCreate File, Seek end of the file, Add a serialized codePersoncode object, close the file. I dont want to serialize a codeListltPersongtcode and write it all at once.  li liFor Reading based on the codeindexcode parameter Open the file, seek the codeindexcode position based on object length, deserialize the object at codeindexcode, return the object.  li liDeletion just like reading the record at codeindexcode position, go to index position, delete it, save the file.  li ul  pIm not sure if using the codeBinaryFormattercode is the right way to do this. e.g for insert, Ive seen examples like  p  precodeFileStream fs  new FileStreamfileName, FileMode.Open BinaryFormatter formatter  new BinaryFormatter formatter.Serializefs, person fs.Close   codepre  pwhich causes all the data in file to be lost and the file will only contain the codepersoncode object. How can I do the Binary readwritedelete of objects in a sequential way in a file My guess for insertion was to use another stream, serialize the object into that stream. write the stream to a byte array and use that byte array to write to the end of my main file stream. But I couldnt think of a suitable way for insertdelete operations. Any better suited approach to use instead of codeBinaryFormattercode  p  pNote To be more clear, he told me the teacher wants them to calculate the amount of time for each operation.br Thank you.p

Negative 1151 pI have an application with a VideoView in it, I set a video to play in the VideoView.  At some point while the video is playing it will get paused. Then after it is paused for some time it will begin to play the video again, but seek forward to the point that the video would be at if it had not been paused. So for instancep  pVideo starts playingp  pVideo paused at 6 secondsp  pvideo stays paused for 10 secondsp  pVideo starts playing again lt at this point I want the video to start playing at the 16 second mark.p  pIn order to achieve this effect I have set up time stamps to do the required math so I know how long the video was paused for, and then when I start it up again, I call codemVideoView.seekTotimePlayed  timePausedcodep  pThis all works as intended on Toshiba Thrive, and Motorola Xoom. However on Acer Iconia A200 It seems that from the point that I call seekTo forward the VideoView will always return the same time when I call codegetCurrentPositioncode. To illustrate this I set up a runnable that fires roughly every 1000ms that logs the current position. Here is some of the output from thatp  precode  These are from before it is pausedresumed  you can see that the current time is functioning  as expected.  Current Position  0 Current Position  734 Current Position  1735 Current Position  2703 Current Position  3737 Current Position  4738 Current Position  5739 Current Position  6740 Current Position  7741 Current Position  8742 Current Position  9743     These are from the exact same runnable  after the video has been paused, and  started again after seekTo.  The position is no longer increasing.  Note that the video is playing correctly on the screen  while these logs happen.  Current Position  23410 Current Position  23410 Current Position  23410 Current Position  23410 codepre  p23410 is the exact time that I am passing in to seekTo, so it seems that after I make this call the VideoView will always return whatever I pass in to it, no matter if it is actually still playing and the position is advancing.p  pHas anyone else experienced this VideoViewMediaPlayer bug before I saw some things on the known issues group that were talking about MediaPlayer returning incorrect values for getCurrentPosition, but didnt find any where it would just stop increasing like this. Most of the ones that I did see, were also trying to play audio rather than video.p

Negative 1151 pMy table codeSectionscode SQL Server has codeIDcode as a primary key codeint, identitycode and codeSortIndexcode column int for sorting purposes.p  pThe database has a trigger which sets codeSortIndex  IDcode at each codeINSERTcode. Obviously I want to change the sorting index later, by swapping the values for two rows.p  pI access the data using Entity Framework, all with MVC3 web application.p  pThe problem is, Entity Framework doesnt update the value of codeSortIndexcode after I insert a new object into the table. It also caches all the data, so the following call to get all objects from this table will also give wrong codeSortIndexcode value for this object.p  pI tried changing codeStoreGeneratedPatterncode for this column in codeEDMXcode. This seems to be great and elegant but doesnt solve the problem.p  pIf I set to codeIdentitycode, it causes EF to properly update the value, but it becomes read only exception thrown when trying to change. Setting it to codeComputedcode is similar, but instead of exception being thrown the values are just not written to the DB.p  pI can recreate the EF object every time if I need to use it after inserting an object, just by doingp  precodeDatabaseEntities db  new DatabaseEntities codepre  pBut it seems like ugly workaround for me.p  pWhats a solution to this problemp  pObviously something, what doesnt require me to do some action after every codeinsertcode and take a risk that its forgotten and unnoticed is preferred. p

Negative 1151 pI have a resource in my project that collects some information from a user. Basically its a form that they fill out before they can access another area of the site.

The code works, but strongit just feels dirtystrong. Its essentially updating a record within the create method under the condition that its not a new record. Im also forced to have an update method in case an existing record comes back with a validation errorthe form helper will then switch the form over to sending to the update method.p  pSo to my point... is there a more appropriate way to push the updateattributes call in the create method to the update method Or better put, is there a better way to respect the RESTful methods in isolating the create and update functionalityp  pUPDATE I wanted to be a little more specific too. If the user has filled this form out before it will set a cookie so they dont have to fill it out again for seven days. However after seven days the cookie is expired and they see the form again. The controller doesnt know if the user is new or existing until they add user input into the form which is then compared based on the email address.p  pThanks in advance I definitely look forward to anyones thoughts on this.p

Negative 1151 pI am having some problems developing a PHP client that will consume Java RESTful services, created in NetBeans 7.1.1.p  pFor those who dont know When you create a Java RESTful webservice based on MySQL database entities, NetBeans will create, automatically, the entities class, and each entity facade, that can be known as a service provider.p  pI developed a web application using Java RESTful webservice server and the Java RESTful client that consumes the webservices through Jersey amp Servlets.p  pNow on to a planned PHP client I already googled a lot, and what I see is no interoperability or im the noob, which is one of the purposes of webservices. I know how to create a RESTful webservice in PHP, and communicate with a PHP client, and the same with Java, but what I want is create the Java RESTful webservices server, and a php client.p  pSorry if I said something wrong on the subject, and feel free to correct me.p  pIf anyone could help me, giving me some ideas, code examples, explaining the knowhow, I would appreciate a lot.p

Negative 1151 pThe task is not easy, as I need to create a PDF version of a page after clicking a button. It has a complicated dom structure, with many elements positioned absolutelyrelatively, and the data is dynamically loaded. I thought about using Phantom.js server for this task, as it enables generating PDFs but this introduces some problems p  ul liphantomjs can be either run from a console which is not possible here as generating PDFs must be available on both UNIX and WIN systems and only shell scripts can be run from the page or using its built in serverli liserver has a different domain as the server running the page, so same origin policy problems apear. I was thinking about using iframe with phantomjs server address as the src and my page html passed in arguments, but the arguments are too long and return 413 error. JSONP wont work, as it was built for GET requests and the same problem with too long arguments appears.li ul  pI also thought about generating it clientside but because of the complexity of the site it would probably take me many days to get proper representation of the page as all the positioning values need to be recalculated to pts, and it has to be a generic solution.p  pAny other ideas how to solve this p

I have an approach that I call Entity Generic that can be applied to any entity in my system  for example, Addresses and Phonesp  pA Customer can have 1 or more of each, along with a Store, Person, or anything really  so why add street, city, state, etc to every thing that needs it when you can just build an Address entity, that takes a Foreign Type and Key what I call EntityType and EntityId  then you have a reusable business object, supporting UI control, etc  so you build it once and reuse it everywhere.p  pThis is where the centralized approach I am pushing for here really comes in handy and I think makes the code much cleaner than having to pass the current data contexttransaction into every method.p  pTake for example that you have a Page for a customer, the Model includes the Customer data, Contact, Address and a few Phone Numbers main, fax, or cell, whateverp  pWhen getting a Customer Edit Model for the page, here is a bit of the code I have put together see how I use the

Next, I apply the matrix to the vector I created, and I add the result to the old position of the camera.p  pHowever, there seems to be a problem with this approach. At first it works just fine, but after a while, when I press Up it goes sideways instead of the way it should.p  h3Actual codeh3  pAs I stated above, I tried to use as little code as possible.

Negative 1151 pI am basically trying to read out all or most attribute values from a DICOM file, using the gdcm C library. I am having hard time to get out any nonstring values. The gdcm examples generally assume I know the groupelement numbers beforehand so I can use the Attribute template classes, but I have no need or interest in them, I just have to report all attribute names and values. Actually the values should go into an XML so I need a string representation. What I currently have is something likep  precodefor gdcmDataSetConstIterator it  ds.Begin itds.End it      const gdcmDataElementamp elem  it     if elem.GetVR  gdcmVRSQ          const gdcmTagamp tag  elem.GetTag         stdcout ltlt dict.GetDictEntrytag.GetKeyword ltlt           stdcout ltlt elem.GetValue ltlt n       codepre  pIt seems for numeric values like UL the output is something like Loaded4, presumably meaning that the library has loaded 4 bytes of data an unsigned long. This is not helpful at all, how to get the actual value I must be certainly overlooking something obvious.p  pFrom the examples it seems there is a gdcmStringFilter class which is able to do that, but it seems it wants to search each element by itself in the DICOM file, which would make the algorithm complexity quadratic, this is certainly something I would like to avoid.p  pTIA Paavop

If you add the variables a hrefhttpwaarneming.nlfotonew02639780.jpgw100amph100 relnofolloww100amph100a, the image is resized. Important to mention is that I need no cropping which doesnt happen in the example too, even though 100x100 is of course not the right ratio. The only thing to happen is what can be done with CSS and HTML too change height and width of a larger picture.

Negative 1151 pIm encountering a scipy function that seems to return a numpy array no matter whats passed to it.  In my application I need to be able to pass scalars and lists only, so the only problem is that when I pass a scalar to the function an array with one element is returned when I would expect a scalar. Should I ignore this behaviour, or hack up the function to ensure that when a scalar is passed a scalar is returnedp  pExample codep  precode usrbinenv python  import scipy import scipy.optimize from numpy import cos   This a some function we want to compute the inverse of def fx     y  x  2cosx     return y   Given y, this returns x such that fxy def finversey       This will be zero if fxy     def minimizethisx         return yfx       A guess for the solution is required     xguess  y     xoptimized  scipy.optimize.fsolveminimizethis, xguess  THE PROBLEM COMES FROM HERE     return xoptimized   If I call finverse with a list, a numpy array is returned print finverse[1.0, 2.0, 3.0] print type finverse[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]    If I call finverse with a tuple, a numpy array is returned print finverse1.0, 2.0, 3.0 print type finverse1.0, 2.0, 3.0    If I call finverse with a scalar, a numpy array is returned print finverse1.0 print type finverse1.0    This is the behaviour I expected scalar passed, scalar returned.

Negative 1151 pIm writing scripts that have to run on a number of different UNIXlike releases. These are written in python 2.x.p  pUnfortunately, some newer releases have taken to calling this flavor binary python2 instead of python. Thus, usrbinenv python doesnt work to look for the proper installed python interpreter. Either I get the version 3 interpreter bad or no interpreter at all worsep  pIs there a clever way to write a python script such that it will load with the python2 interpreter if installed, else the python interpreter if its installed Id have to use other mechanisms to detect when python is a python3, but as Im inside a pythonlike environment at that point, I can live with that.p  pI imagine I can write a ripple launcher, call it findpython2, and use that as the  interpreter for the script, but that means I have to install findpython2 in the search path, which is decidedly suboptimal these scripts are often called by absolute reference, so theyre not in the path.p

Negative 1151 pI am working on video frames using OpenCV. My question might be low leveled, but I want to clarify it first. p  pThere are plenty of pixel based methods available in openCV, but can I change them into frame based ones p  pTo me, it is similar, since the whole frame is also stored in one matrix, and I will read that matrix from the beginning to end to handle it. So for instance for finding average value, the only thing I should change is find the total average of whole pixels for one frame. p  pBut for one pixel, see several frames and decide that pixels average based on them.

Negative 1151 pThe GoF book states that product classes in builder pattern does not necessarily need to inherit from a base class.

The director would use the builder to build the object and return the complete object finally.p  pMy question is how would the director be designed if product classes would not share same base class In C this can be easily implemented with using generics but a design pattern does not depend on language features. Defining separate methods for each type of concrete product does not seem good idea as it will tightly couple the director with product class and any new product class will require a change in director class.p  pPlease let me know your thoughts.p

In FireFox though it works as intended, plays one doesnt loop. p  pIs this a bug in the GIFEncoder p  pAm i doing something wrong p  pAnd how do i solve thisp  pmy Codep  precodegif  new GIFEncoder                                frames,  frames array                             time,  elapsed time array                             1,  loops 0  infinite                             0,  disposal                             3, 2, 1,                             0, rgb of transparency                             url  source type          codepre  pGIFEncoder classp  precodeClass GIFEncoder      var GIF  GIF89a             GIF header 6 bytes        var VER  GIFEncoder V3.00   Encoder version                    var BUF  Array       var OFS  Array       var SIG   0     var LOP   0     var DIS   2     var COL  1     var IMG  1      var ERR  Array              ERR00gtDoes not supported function for only one image,             ERR01gtSource is not a GIF image,             ERR02gtUnintelligible flag ,             ERR03gtDoes not make animation from animated GIF source,                                GIFEncoder...               function GIFEncoder                                                          GIFsrc, GIFdly, GIFlop, GIFdis,                                                     GIFred, GIFgrn, GIFblu, GIFofs,                                                     GIFmod                                                           if   isarray  GIFsrc  ampamp  isarray  GIFdly                        printf   s s, thisgtVER, thisgtERR [ ERR00 ]                      exit     0                           if  isarray  GIFofs  ampamp count  GIFofs  gt 1                       thisgtSIG  1                     thisgtOFS  GIFofs                          thisgtLOP  GIFlop  false  false   GIFlop gt 1   GIFlop  0             thisgtDIS   GIFdis gt 1     GIFdis lt 3   GIFdis  3   2             thisgtCOL   GIFred gt 1 ampamp GIFgrn gt 1 ampamp GIFblu gt 1                                                GIFred   GIFgrn ltlt 8    GIFblu ltlt 16    1              for  i  0 i lt count  GIFsrc  i                       if  strToLower  GIFmod   url                               thisgtBUF [ ]  fread  fopen  GIFsrc [ i ], rb , filesize  GIFsrc [ i ]                                            else if  strToLower  GIFmod   bin                               thisgtBUF [ ]  GIFsrc [ i ]                                          else                              printf   s s  s , thisgtVER, thisgtERR [ ERR02 ], GIFmod                              exit     0                                           if  substr  thisgtBUF [ i ], 0, 6   GIF87a ampamp substr  thisgtBUF [ i ], 0, 6   GIF89a                               printf   s d s, thisgtVER, i, thisgtERR [ ERR01 ]                              exit     0                                           for  j   13  3   2 ltlt  ord  thisgtBUF [ i ]  10   amp 0x07   , k  TRUE k j                               switch  thisgtBUF [ i ]  j                                        case                                              if   substr  thisgtBUF [ i ],  j  3 , 8    NETSCAPE                                                       printf   s s  s source , thisgtVER, thisgtERR [ ERR03 ],  i  1                                                       exit     0                                                                                           break                                     case                                              k  FALSE                                             break                                                                            GIFEncoderGIFAddHeader               for  i  0 i lt count  thisgtBUF  i                       GIFEncoderGIFAddFrames  i, GIFdly [ i ]                           GIFEncoderGIFAddFooter                                 GIFAddHeader...               function GIFAddHeader                cmap  0              if  ord  thisgtBUF [ 0 ]  10   amp 0x80                       cmap  3   2 ltlt  ord  thisgtBUF [ 0 ]  10   amp 0x07                        thisgtGIF . substr  thisgtBUF [ 0 ], 6, 7                                thisgtGIF . substr  thisgtBUF [ 0 ], 13, cmap                            ifthisgtLOP  false                                                   thisgtGIF . 37713NETSCAPE2.031 .

Negative 1151 pI have a C application that requires .net version 4 in order to run.  I know how to create a basic installer using the Visual Stuido Installer Setup Project that comes with Visual Studio and that installs my application fine, however, I cant get it to check if .net version 4 is already installed in the client machine and if not install it.  Does anyone have any suggestions  Should I use a different approach besides this method Purchasing a license for InstallShield is not an option as that is too expensive.  Thanksp

Negative 1151 pI have a nice function that converts a simple, duh xml to an array, and to do so it uses the codeSimpleXmlIteratorcode class.p  pIt works quite well, but Id like to make it accept not only xml source strings or codeSimpleXmlIteratorcode objects, but codeSimpleXmlElementcodes too since I use them way more often that iterators that I use just in that function, actually.p  pWhat I did so far wasp  precodeiter  new SimpleXmlIteratorxmlgtasXML codepre  pbut to me its like passing through Tokyo to get from Paris to London.

Negative 1151 pI am working on what will be a freemium radio streaming app.  Essentially, the app will be free to download, and for no purchase, you can stream a max of 1 hour of live content per day, and have access to a limited archive selection to stream or download.  What I would like to do is set up inapp subscriptions so the user can pay by month or year, with option to autorenew. Doing this would remove time restriction and grant access to a larger archive selection. After the initial time of subscription has passed, and hasnt auto renewed, it would go back to its limited use.  I have never done subscriptions before, and want to make sure this is something that can be done, and that abides by Apples inapp purchasing rules. p

Each point has an index by which I differ objects points with value 3 refers only to a trajectory of object with index 3. Now I would like to draw a line that would connect the following in time axis points.p  pI found out that streamlinex, y, z, u, v, w, sx, sy, sz function would suit me perfectly. However I cant define the proper u, v, w matrix.

But the result of streamline is empty space. Could anyone give me some advice p

Negative 1151 pI have an android application that reads an XML file and presents some information to the user. The data structure is a simple ArrayList. The user goes through the list and they may make changes or they may not make changes just depending. When they are done they save. p  pEventually we want that data on the RDBMS but they may not have a data connection at that exact moment so I need to persist it. Even if they do have a data connection I would probably feel comfortable knowing I have the data structure serialized to the sd card.p  pSo step one is do I persist it in a binary state it is a very small data object or serialize it out to XML which is what I was thinking at first. That way it can be uploaded to a web service in its xml form.p  pIf I serialize it out to XML are there any libraries  example I can read up on.

Negative 1151 pIm working on developing a onlinejudge type system where maybe 100 or so untrusted executables will all be running simultaneously and evaluating the same input data.p  pId like each executable to be limited to an equal share of CPU, memory, disk space, etc. of a predefined resource pool. For example if the resource pool were set to 34 of the machines CPU, 3 GB of memory, 300 GB of disk, and 2 executables were running, each would get 38 of the CPU, 1.5 GB of memory, 150 GB of disk. If another were to join in, the resource would be readjusted into three equal slices. This is to prevent a malicious or buggy executable from stealing resources from others as well as to give everyone equal resources.p  pIdeally, Id also like the executables to not be constrained to a single language e.g. let users develop in whatever theyre comfortable  C, C, Java, Python, etc..p  pUsing a whole VM or something like OpenVZ seems like overkill. Are there lighter weight alternatives that essentially use a separate process for each executable while limiting its resources, disabling things like network access, process spawning, etc. Part of the reason Im looking for a light weight solution is that theres quite a bit of input data  would rather not have to copy it to each executable but let them read from shared memory.p

Negative 1151 pFor example, when you create a single page application using ASP.NET MVC and some Web API controllers using REST it tends to be a lot of request to the server because often the views depends on some complex data.

On the client side Im using Backbone.js and my controllers are handling one type each for codeGetcode, codeGetint idcode like REST should be implemented. In my case this is not an open API, its just my application who consumes it.

Negative 1151 pI am writing a StateManager for a game Im using C and SFML, but I tried to hide language specific elements because this is a question about any OOP language. I have a setup in which a StateManager updates the current active state. However, a State must be able to change the active state e.g. pressing Play in a menu starts a PlayingState, so I keep a reference to the StateManager in my State class.p  pHeres an UML diagram to make things more clear. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCiq1q.png altUML diagram StateManagerp  pAs you see, StateManager and State both reference eachother. How can I avoid spaghetticode Should I make the StateManager a singleton class While were at it, should the game class be a singleton class I could easily do this, but I dont really like other classes in my game being able to access the game class or statemanager class, even if I am the only programmer.p

Negative 1151 pI am attempting to create a WinForms application which allows the user to display and edit  data stored in a MSSQL database. The data being altered is hierarchical, and within a single level of the hierarchy the properties which may be altered are identical in other words the controls for a single level of the hierarchy are the same, but they may differ from other levels.p  pI am trying to create the application in such a way that there is only a single form with controls that update based on the hierarchical level of the item being viewed by the user. I realize this is possible by putting all the controls for all levels on a single form and updating their Visible property, but that method makes design of the form difficult due to clutter... Have any of you found a more elegantless ugly solutionp

So the 1 hour offset in the results could be caused by thatp  pstrongEDITstrong It turned out that the NULL values returned had nothing to do with the time at all.  In the above query all values for positionIDs between 1 and 37 were returned but only selected positionIDs were included into the pivot table.p  pOf those positionID values that were included none were available for the latest time stamp, BUT in the result set of positionID between 1 and 37 there were some positionIDs for which values were present for the 20130405 070000 time stamp, which created such a record in the DB and filled in NULL for positionIDs which didnt have values at that time stamp.p

Negative 1151 pThere is an opinion that when building rich browser applications JSheavy it should be treated as separate application not as a part of the backend app. I wonder how is build and deployment realized in such setupp  pSay I have java WAR file which exposes JSONbased API be it JAXRS or whatever  no views. Then I have static content for my frontend app js script html views, css styles, images etc. I could use dedicated build tool e.g. GruntJS for that project to minifypreprocess etc. p  pBut now Im kind of stuck. What should be result of such build Separate WAR with only static files created by Grunt What about the deployment Should I mix those WARs together into one fullblown app or deploy two separate e.g. codeexample.comcode serves static and those statics use codeapi.example.comcode to get data.p  pAnother question is about development. As a result Id like to have my js and css concatenated and minified, but its not so good for development debugging is hard etc.. Is there any trick to have separate source files in dev mode and concatenated only on prod buildp

Negative 1151 pSuppose you have a language where identifiers might begin with keywords.  For example, suppose case is a keyword, but caser is a valid identifier.  Suppose also that the lexer rules can only handle regular expressions.  Then it seems that I cant place keyword rules ahead of the identifier rule in the lexer, because this would parse caser as case followed by r. I also cant place keyword lexing rules after the identifier rule, since the identifier rule would match the keywords, and the keyword rules would never trigger.p  pSo, instead, I could make a keywordoridentifier rule in the lexer, and have the parser determine if a keywordoridentifier is a keyword or an identifier.  Is this what is normally donep  pI realize that use a different lexer that has lookahead is an answer kind of, but Im also interested in how this is done in a traditional DFAbased lexer, since my current lexer seems to work that way.p

Negative 1151 pI was reading a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2howtourllib2.html relnofollowcodeurllib2codea tutorial wherein it mentions that in order to access a page that requires authentication e.g. valid username and password, the server first sends an codeHTTPcode header with error code 401 and python client then sends a request with authentication details.p  pNow, the problem in my case is that there exist two different versions of a webpage, one that can be accessed without supplying any authentication details and one that is quite different when authentication details are supplied i.e. when the user is logged in the system. As an example think about url a hrefhttpgmail.com relnofollowwww.gmail.coma, when you are not logged in you get a login page, but if your browser remembers you from your last login then the result is your email account homepage with your inbox displayed.p  pI follow all the details to set up an codehandlercode for authentication and install an codeopenercode.

Negative 1151 pWe have prodcution software running on the feild , which has ixp23xx netowrk processor with XSCALE arm core running linux 2.6.24. We have seen occasional problem from the feild and sometimes reproduced in the lab, the console prints the below fault line Unhandled fault imprecise external abort 0x416 at 0x40019004. Further digging, we found that we have few page table entries, where virtual addresses are not mapped to valid physical address. thus access to those virtual addresses can cause the impricise aborts. The final solution would be to remove the wrong mapping and thus next time we should get segmentation fault which would precise and easy to catch. But removing wrong entries will take some time and we have to create the build with debugging information thus this option is for later time.p  pComing back to question,  As per the XSCALE data sheet, this fault can be made almost precise3 instr with stall untill complete by setting the Xbit  0, C bit 0 and B bit0. but i am not sure how exactly to do it in linux and is it going to help  basically this looks like disable the DCACHE. The code under arcarmmmprocxscale.S is all assembly and i am not sure how exactly to disable. There is one option in the Kernel Config i.e. CONFIGCPUDCACHEDISABLE , this seems to disable the DCACHE but will it be same as XCB bits equal to 0 below are the excerpt from data sheetp  pp  blockquote   pImprecise data aborts may create scenarios difficult for an abort   handler to recover. Both external data aborts and data cache parity   errors may result in corrupted targeted register data. Because these   faults are imprecise, it is possible corrupted data will have been   used before the Data Abort fault handler is invoked. Because of this,   software should treat imprecise data aborts as unrecoverable.Even   memory accesses marked as stall until complete see Section 3.2.2.4   can result in imprecise data aborts. For these types of accesses, the   fault is somewhat less imprecise than the general case it is   guaranteed to be raised within three instructions of the instruction   that caused it. In other words, if a stall until complete LD or ST   instruction triggers an imprecise fault, then that fault will be seen   by the program within three instructions. If the MMU is disabled all   data accesses will be noncacheable and nonbufferable. This is the   same behavior as when the MMU is enabled, and a data access uses a   descriptor with X, C, and B all set to 0. The X, C, and B bits   determine when the processor should place new data into the Data   Cache. The cache places data into the cache in lines also called   blocks. Thus, the basis for making a decision about placing new data   into the cache is a called a Line Allocation Policy. If the Line   Allocation Policy is readallocate, all load operations that miss the   cachep blockquote  pp
Negative 1151 pFor each location in the result matrix, instead of storing the dot product of the corresponding row and column in the argument matrices, I would like like to store the element wise product, which will be a vector extending into a third dimension.p  pOne idea would be to convert the argument matrices to vectors with vector entries, and then take their outer product, but Im not sure how to do this either.p  pEDITp  pI figured it out before I saw there was a reply.

Negative 1151 pI am looking at emSubCutem and emScaldiem to use in my projects. The examples provided in their respective emGetting Startedem documents seem very similar. Neither project seems to provide documentation beyond emGetting Startedem and scala docs.p  pCould somebody summarize the practical differences between these frameworks primarily in terms of features and maturitystability. I am looking into these packages because I need to be able to create and compose configuration dynamically at runtime. Runtime configuration is the main reason I am looking at these libraries instead of using implicits andor the layer cake pattern to do DIconfiguration, so run time configuration facilities are the most important to me. Also I do not think compiler plugins are an option for me, but both of these libraries can be used without their respective plugins with only a small increase in verbosity. I am on scala2.9.2 for the moment.p  pI am also interested in suggestions for doing runtime DIconfiguration directly in Scala, but converting my whole project to monadic style is also not an option for me.p

Negative 1151 pI have a bootstrap code.btncode that I want to toggle with the mouse click. The problem is that the response is way too slow on tablets, since the codeclickcode arrives 300 ms after the codetouchstartcode in mobile browsers. p  pI tried binding the logic in the codetouchstartcode event, effectively breaking the app for desktop browsers where there is no codetouchstartcode. I then thought of binding the same logic also to codeclickcode but then I get a repeated event in mobile browsers. Ive juggling around, trying to unbind from codeclickcode the first time I receive a codetouchstartcode, and so on, and managed to come up with a design so complicated that there is always some quirk here or there that I cannot solve. p  pFor instance, I cant get a text input to receive focus in the tablet if I do focus on codetouchstartcode then the codeclickcode event returns the focus to the button. I tried jQuery Mobiles codevmousedowncode, but I couldnt manage to have multitouch tapping more than one button at the same time only changed one of them. I dont want to reinvent a lot of wheels, and Im sure I must be missing something obvious, either on jQuery Mobile, or plain JavaScript. p  pIn concrete, I want an event like codevmousedowncode that works both on desktops and mobiles, only fires once on each, and allows multitouch. p

Negative 1151 pI am trying to insert double values to my database via EF 5. I generated EF entity model from db. There is a price column in the table which is float, and naturally EF generated a double type for the mapper class.  I read some string values from a file and convert it to double and save it to db. When I debug I can see that values are converted correctly. For example string value code120,53code is converted to double like code120.53code, just fine. But when I save my context it goes to db like code12053code.p  pWhat can cause such a problem Is there any setting in SQL Server has anything to do with thisp

Negative 1151 pIm working on a project translating old Windows 95 MFC code to C11.  I was wondering, if no mouse buttons are clicked during a move, what is the value of the UINT nFlags passed into the OnMouseMove functionp  pIm not very familiar with MFC and I dont have access to a Windows machine to do any tests myself, so my understanding about this functions behavior may be incorrect.  I know that if its left clicked, middle or right there are special system values that the OnMouseMove function will receive in the nFlags like MKLBUTTON, which is 0x0001.  I was wondering what the value for nFlags will be if nothing in particular has been clicked and the mouse has move, is it just 0x0000  Thank you very much, any help with this matter is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 1151 pI asked this question a couple months ago, but there has been no response so I thought I would try again. I have a block of SSJS that manipulates a number of values. There are some computed fields that are impacted by these changes and they do not display correctly. I have a refresh button on the XPage and it does a partial refresh after which everything works fine. I need to somehow trigger a partial refresh on the a specific item a panel in this case as the last step in the afterPageLoad in the SSJS.  Any ideasp  pThanksp

Negative 1151 pIm using a proprietary development environment that compiles code written in C, as well as the IEC 61131 languages. For the C compilation, it uses GCC 4.1.2 with these build options fPIC O0 g nostartfiles Wall trigraphs fnoasm The compilation is done by a program running on windows utilizing Cygwin.p  pMy issue is, IEC language preprocessor is not that useful doesnt support define at all and I want to use macros I dont see why the GCC preprocessor would really care what language it is processing my target language is Structured Text, so Im looking to see if anyone might know a way to get it to process files of different file types that then are not compiled further Im just looking for macro expansion before the file is run through the IEC compiler. Im very ignorant of compiler options and environments since Ive never had to deal with them, I just write C code and it magically compiles and transfers to my target system to run.p  pThe only things I can really do are add build options and execute a batch file before anything is executed. I think my best hope lies in using a batch file to process all files of a certain extension, but I dont even know what executable in the gnuinst folder to use, let alone what flags to use to run through the files.p

Why couldnt the VTBL in the case of multiple inheritance consist of all the virtual functions that the class can respond to just like in the case of single inheritance This should speed up the process since we dont have to look for the method implementation at run time throughout the whole inheritance hierarchy. p  pCan anyone clarify this for mep  pEdit When I refer to the dispatch algorithm for multiple inheritance Im referring to the following img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commHuZE.png altenter image description here Just to clarify notice how weve got to traverse the hierarchy to search for the implementation rather than just going to the current classs VTBL and calling jumping to the method.p

Negative 1151 pIm having trouble making a simple FB app. p  pI developed it on localhost and it worked perfectly. The whole idea is to have a desktop app which launches a facebook login page with a return url. Once the user succesfully logs in, he is sent to that return url to display a message that says Thanks for logging.p  pWhen I try it on localhost by setting my app domain and Site url on facebook to localhost it works flawlessly. But now that I moved the php to a webserver, my user var never gets populated. Yes, I updated the app domain and return url on facebook to point to my domain.p  pI started investigating and tracked down what I think could be the error. On the basefacebook.php theres this stronggetUserFromAvailableDatastrong method with the following portion of code The echos are mine btwp  precodeaccesstoken  thisgtgetAccessToken  echo Access Token .accesstoken.ltbrgt echo thisgtgetApplicationAccessToken.ltbrgt  if accesstoken ampamp accesstoken  thisgtgetApplicationAccessToken ampamp user ampamp persistedaccesstoken  accesstoken     echo This doesnt get printed at all.   user  thisgtgetUserFromAccessToken   if user          thisgtsetPersistentDatauserid, user    else          thisgtclearAllPersistentData      return user codepre  pAs you can see, theres a echo that never gets printed and I managed to find out that getAccessToken and getApplicationAccessToken return the exact same string, which is why my user comes empty.p  pSo my question would be Why does this work on localhost but not on my webserver What am I doing wrongp  pThanksp

Negative 1151 pI have a Multiplayer browser game, and I want to add animals to it. I would like the animals to be able to walk randomly in the map.

Im trying to do a system that spawns a few animals when the player enters a room, and then he can approach it and fight it. if he doesnt fight the animal, itll just stay there and move randomly untill there arent any players in the room. Every room will have its own animals, so if there are 2 players in the room theyll see the same animals. The animals posiition will be saved in MySQL, and using AJAX Im going to update the position of the animal. The only thing Javascript does is showing the animal to the player on the map.p  pWhat is the best way to do the AI And is it possible in PHP Im not talknig about the random movement specificly, I also mean the AI code for other things that the animal will do. I googled it and couldnt find what I needed.p  pP.S I built the game using PHP and JQuery. and of course CSS and HTMLp  pHelp is much appreciated p

Negative 1151 pIm working on a program to find the longest common substring between multiple strings. Ive lowered my approach down to either using suffix arrays or a suffix tree.

Negative 1151 pIn my database, I have the attributes startingdate, endingdate, daterange, numdays and a few others that are not of any importance for my question. I am trying to build a leave application system, allowing users to apply leave.p  pThe attributes startingdate and endingdate are rather self explanatory. numdays is the number of days from the startingdate to the endingdate. As for daterange it is all the dates from the starting date to the ending date, excluding the starting date. For example, if the starting date is 20140101 and the ending date is 20140103, the daterange would be 20140102 20140103. I need this for a php calendar to highlight the dates that the user had already applied leave on. p  pThe problem that I encountered is that I am not sure how to find the number of days a user had taken a leave this year. Lets say that a user applied leave on 20141230 to 20150102, the daterange would be 20141231 20150101 20150102. How do I find the number of days that are in 2014p  pSorry for the long question.p

Negative 1151 pI am using gcc to compile some code for an ARM CortexM4F microcontroller.  My application uses a large collection of data that I have conveniently written into a C file large arrays of ints and floats, circular linked lists pointing to those various arrays, various structs, that sort of thing.p  pWhen I compile this it adds up to about 500K of data, plus a few hundred K for the actual application.  gcc is putting all this data conveniently into the .data section ld then tries to build the elf putting the .data section into RAM and .text code section into FLASH.  The mcu I am using doesnt have 500K of RAM so it cannot build the ELF, but it does have 1M of FLASH.  I tried changing my linker script so that both .data and .text are put into FLASH which worked but there are some other bit of code that expect its data to go into RAM, so ultimately execution failed I cant make that sweeping change.p  pWhat I need is to tell gcc to put every single object in this C file into the .text section so it can go into FLASH with the rest of the nonmutable stuff, or at least some other section which I can then instruct my linker script what to do with so that it doesnt interfere with existing blobs that have no problem fitting in RAM.  I dont know how to do that.  Here is a very slimmed down example of what I havep  precode data.c  static char optionarray00[]       O0.40,     KFOO,     JARJAR,   static int widtharray00[]       0,     1,     1,   Window windowarray0[]                optionarray,         widtharray,     ,    main.c  extern Window windowarray0[] int main       Do stuff   codepre  pThe stuff in data.c, windowarray0 and everything or most everything, maybe the string arrays are going to .text it links to, is being put in .data which my linker script puts into RAM.  I want it all in a different section which I can then put into FLASH. There are thousands of these types of arrays in there, plus hundreds of structs and dozens of other bits of information.  Is this possible to change  As a test I replaced my windowarray0 with a char[500000] of random data and that compiled without complaint so I assume it put it all into .text as would be expected, I just dont know how to make it do so for arbitrary objects.

Negative 1151 pI have been given data to create spatial priors for GM WM and CSF for a project involving brain segmentation using the level set method.p  pI am currently stuck on how to remove the skull from Axial coronal and sagittal vies of the brain essentially i want to extract the brain and just have the GM, WM and CSF intact.p  pI have attempted using thresholding and coderegionpropscode in matlab but they leave a piece of the skull always and then remove some of the GM etc.p  pideally i would like to make it a built in part of my final piece of code. p  pThanks in advance for any advice or guidance on this. p  pThe image below is similar to the data I have, except in my case the skull is not perfectly connected. p  pHow would i extract the CSF and GM and WM from this i am confused as to how to threshold the image for each type of tissue to create a sort of statistical map. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comR3F96.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 1151 pIm still a new programmer, and I have a problem getting this piece of code to work that I got from a hrefhttpdeveloperparadize.blogspot.com201306jqueryfullcalendarintegrationwith.html relnofollowherea. It uses MySQL to store the data. I would like to understand all the various parts to this, but Im just now really starting to understand how ajax and jQuery work together.p  pIt for displaying data, it relies on events.php. I have run that separately, and it generates JSON that should work for display in the calendar, so I know the SQL works fine, but it wont display on the main page. The paths to the libraries, CSS, and so on have been changed, but the function to insert into the MySQL table works fine... So I can use this to insert dates, but once there, they dont show up on a refresh.p  pstrongEDIT SOLVED. A combination of three problems, as far as I can tell 1  Make sure the returned JSON does NOT have quotes around false. 2 Make sure you have jquery.min.map. this was found out by looking at the Chromes debugger, and 3 I could NOT use the files path... I just refer to it as events.php.strong Thanks to everyone that helpedp  pHeres the html below... and below THAT, the JSON. I have seen a couple other posts that never had solutions, so obviously, any help GREATLY appreciatedp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltlink hreffullcalendarfullcalendar.css

Negative 1151 pI am with a issue in a QT  C OpenGL project. The main problem is that I need to use a QText area to receive the number of cells in a array, but Im not succeding. The fact is that, as the array is created within the moment my project starts to run Id need to redifine its size, and then use it... Ive already tried using reallocto reallocate more memory to my array after using free, but when I try to do it my results are either a unexpected shut of the execution or a lot of crazy plots... What I really need to know is if I can pass the content in my TextArea to my Class CPontowhich contains the array and then build the array, or if I should use a CPontoreallocate like and then realloc or freecallocmalloc the array to start the thing... I know thats kind complex to understand, but Im not understanding my issue too, I thought that the freemalloccalloc would work...p

Negative 1151 pIm currently working on implementing Geokit into my project. I want to take the info that a user enters onto the create website, geocode the address, and create the entry with the new latitude and longitude created. However, lat or long wont be entered by the user because our geokit will do it for them. Overall, when the user presses the Create button, our controller should take all the info assuming its been validated geocode the given address, and use the generated lat and long to create the new entry. I have some general idea how to but not exactly sure if directly changing the controller is the right method to do so. Ive included my controller code for visual help.

Negative 1151 pIve got several github java projects. One of them Ive manually deployed to sonatypes repository so that it gets published in maven central.p  pThis has been a somewhat painful process in the sense that it seems to involve too many hoops to jump through and a lot of manual work and Id like to automate that.  So I actually stopped doing that because it was just too much work. Theres plenty of documentation that suggests this is possible and quite a bit that suggest that it somehow involves doing something with the strongemnexusstagingmavenpluginemstrong.  Unfortunately all of that documentation is in typical maven style skipping over the essential details that would allow me to figure out in a straightforward way the minimum amount of steps necessary that allow me to automatically publish release builds to the sonatype repository i.e. without me manually approving things. p  pSo, what is the blurb that needs to be present in my empomem assume a otherwise bog standard uncomplicated java project, including urls for the sonatype repository, all documentation Ive found seems to insist localhost8081 is it, and the required maven incantations to make it do a release preferably via the strongemmvn release pluginemstrong, have it sign the artifacts, and have it deploy the resulting artifacts to sonatype, approved and all ready to be synced to maven central, etc.p  pSo, Im sort of looking for  the maven replacement of a gem push in the ruby world, which gets the job done in a convenient one liner. Its a simple case of given a jar file approved by me, how do I get it to end up in maven central with the least amount of fuss. p  pId very much appreciate some examples of pom files already setup to do this that I can copy and adapt.p  h2Edith2  pHeres my working empomem filep    precodeltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 httpmaven.apache.orgxsdmaven4.0.0.xsdgt     ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt     ltgroupIdgtcom.jillesvangurpltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtjsonjltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt1.34SNAPSHOTltversiongt      ltnamegtJsonJltnamegt     ltdescriptiongtA framework for working with json in Java the proper way.

Negative 1151 pI am trying to use the iOS didEnterRegion method in my app. I have a tableView that passes the user to a profileViewController.

Negative 1151 pa hrefhttpsgithub.comangularuiuirouterwikiMultipleNamedViews relnofollowFrom the UIrouter Doca, it says that for each state, you can set up multiple view and provide a different template and controller for each.

Negative 1151 pHello everyone,               I am developing an application. Their is a cursor adapter which holds different view like image , number, date etc. I want to add a image inside this adapter. By clicking on this image we can perform different task  open another activity . But we can also click on our adapter. So what I want is an adapter which is click able , and inside this adapter I want an image button which is also click able but perform different operation. I tried to set the onclickListner of that image button inside cursor and inside bind view . But only image button remain click able  not adapter . Hope you got my problem. Need a serious solution. Thanks  p

Negative 1151 pIve been struggling to load big chunks of data into bigquery for a little while now. In Googles docs, I see the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comresourcesapilibrariesdocumentationbigqueryv2pythonlatestbigqueryv2.tabledata.htmlinsertAll relnofollowinsertAlla method, which seems to work fine, but gives me 413 Entity too large errors when I try to send anything over about 100k of data in JSON. a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.combigqueryloadingdataintobigquery relnofollowPer Googles docs, I should be able to send up to 1TB of uncompressed data in JSONa. What gives The example on the previous page has me building the request body manually instead of using insertAll, which is uglier and more error prone. Im also not sure what format the data should be in in that case. p  pSo, all of that said, what is the cleanproper way of loading lots of data into Bigquery An example with data would be great. If at all possible, Id really rather not build the request body myself.p

Negative 1151 pIm building a site for one of my very first clients using Wordpress SimplicityLite Theme. Id like to alter the theme somehow so as to hyperlink my images in the featuredboxes position Right below the slideshowshow to open up a page in the same window.  The problem is that the images are automatically generatedfetched by a PHP script that picks them up from the media gallery and so one script does it all for all the eight images.  I want to make each of these images as fetched by PHP link to its own page to add interactivity to my site but Ive tried several things but all in vain both in the style.css and the featuredbox.php files.  I think its because I cant find element to hyperlink since its autogenerated.  Below is a section of the PHP script in the featuredbox.php file that fetches the 8 images and places them in the featuredboxes positionsp  precodeltdiv idfeaturedboxsgt ltphp foreach range1,8 as fboxn  gt ltspan classfeaturedboxgt  ltimg classboximage srcltphp echo ofgetoptionfeaturedimage . fboxn,    gettemplatedirectoryuri . imagesfeaturedimage . fboxn . .png gtgt lth3gtltphp echo ofgetoptionfeaturedtitle . fboxn, Simplicity Theme for Small   Business gtlth3gt ltdiv classcontentversepgtltdivgtltbr gt ltpgtltphp echo ofgetoptionfeatureddescription . fboxn , The Color changing   options of Simplicity will give the WordPress Driven Site an attractive look.

Its partially working because it lets me specify a page to or any other resource to hyperlink to in the theme options. However, when I link to a resource, Im instead taken to that very media elementimage itself and not the hyperlink specified. Ive tried some other way of linking a particular image used to a page using the media id that the theme assigns the image used in the permalink but Ive failed to pull it off too. The permalink looks like this in the media library a hrefhttpwww..comattachmentid281 relnofollowhttpwww..comattachmentid281a . I was thinking of noting down these Ids and use them in the featuredbox.php file that fetches the images so that if it fetches the image and its Id is equivalent to the one specified, it automatically hyperlinks it to the page specified. Below is the current solution that Im at. However, its not fully working as noted abovep  ol lipAdding a Hyperlink Option for Simplicity Lite Add this hyperlink option into line 8990 of simplicityliteincoptions.phpp  poptions[]  array name  Hyperlink,  desc  Input the link for the Featured Areas.,  id  featuredhyperlink . fbsinumber, std  , type  text, p  pSave the file and youll see a new option in your theme options.

Negative 1151 pI am loading a 10GB file into memory and I find that even if I strip away any extra overhead and store the data in nothing but an array it still takes up 53 GB of ram. This seems crazy to me since I am converting some of the text data to longs which take up less room and convert the rest to char  which should take up the same amount of room as a text file. I have about 150M rows of data in the file I am trying to load. Is there any reason why this should take up so much ram when I load it the way I do belowp  pThere are three files here a fileLoader class and its header file and a main that simply runs them.  To answer some questions OS is UBUNTU 12.04 64bit This is on a machien with 64GB of RAM and an SSD hd that I have providing 64GB of swap space for RAM I am loading all of the data at once becuase of the need for speed. It is critical for the application. All sorting, indexing, and lots of the data intensive work runs on the GPU.  The other reason is that loading all of the data at once made it much simpler for me to write the code. I dont have to worry about indexed files, and mappings to locations in another file for example.p  pHere is the header filep  precodeifndef FILELOADERH define FILELOADERH include ltiostreamgt include

Negative 1151 pI am encountering an error when I try to use memcpy on a wchart string. Specifically, despite the length I am sending in to memcpy being correct for the length of the string I want to copy, only the first half of the characters in the string are copied over. This leaves me with bad data in the target string, since the latter half of the string is full of garbage characters left over from newing up the string.p  pScreenshot below shows the exact problem I am dealing withp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlz8xg.png altscreenshot of code with watches showing the values I get when my code runs The only thing I can think of is that this might be somehow related to me having my locale set to Japanese for nonUnicode applications, but the first thing I did was to change the locale back to English and the problem remains the same.

Negative 1151 pI am new to VBA and am currently still studying the most basic ideas of the language. I havent gotten that far in my VBA Code studies to write the code I need by hand, so, in the mean time, I have been using the VBA Editor to enter Property Values via the Properties Window. This has been proving far more difficult than I anticipated. My Goal is to create a drop down list for a VBA Form. I understand one of my options is to reference a range of cells in my excel worksheet by inputting it into the value field located right of the ControlSource Property. My attempts to input the desired range always comes up with the same errorp  pstrongCould not set the ControlSource Property. Invalid Property Value.strongp  pI have tried looking in the VBA Help files and even searched online. I havent had any luck finding the proper syntax to enter into this field.p  pI am assuming I may run into similar issues as I try to set other property values through the Property Window. Thus, I am diligently studying my VBA courses so I can simply write the raw code. But that takes time and I need this form to work as soon as possible.p  pIs there anyone out there that wouldnt mind lending me their brain for a moment I would be most grateful. Having this working would bring a lot of stress off of me.p  pThanks for readingp

Negative 1151 pSo, I wanted to get some advice on how to appropriately model a business logic domain.p  pWithout going into too much NDA information, Im trying to model a relatively large system that includes projects and people nothing too scary so far. Right now Im building it in Rails just to get something out the door quickly, but eventually Im going to switch it over to an Ember.jsJSON app not that that really matters for this question.p  pSo the system has a couple different types of people  there are users people who can actually log in to the system, and contacts information about people such as phone number, address, email, etc.. The only reason that these two are separated is they are logically different contact info is not needed for login, and not every contact will need login info or should be ABLE to login. One question right off the bat is whether it makes sense to keep these two entities separate, or if I should just make one broad, flat object with all the fields to model both logins and Im thinking of all the fields that Devise adds here and all the fields to do contact info.p  pAdditionally, there are projects. Projects have people as contacts in different capacities one project might have Fred as a lead or manager and Diana as a customer. Its possible although unlikely that another project might have Diana as a lead and Fred as another role. The point being that the roles that each contact plays in each project is fluid. There are a few roles that HAVE to be filled for a project to be valid well, not necessarily valid, but active.p  pFinally, for a twist, the app is multitenanted. So the system itself has multiple customers for lack of a better term who have their OWN customers, and all of the toplevel customer data must be kept strictly partitioned.p  pRight now, heres what Im doingp  ol liDarn near everything has a customerid field on it, so that I can scope all requests by my own customers.li liAs mentioned above, users people who can login and contacts humanuseful information ABOUT people are separate. One user must have one contact, but contacts do not have to be associated with users in Rails, Im associating this by saying User belongsto Contact. This is the first place where Im not 100 sure Im doing it right.li liProjects and contacts are joined manytomany through a join table so that a given project can have multiple contacts and vice versa. The join table includes a role property so that I can say what role a contact plays in a project. This... works, but it makes the SQL very clunky and I worry, slow. True, AREL manages most of the SQL for me, but still to get decent queries and avoid N1 issues, I have to do a lot of .joins.includes calls, which to me sounds like a leaky abstraction.li ol  pSo, Ill leave it at that, and end with what I started with anyone got any advice or tips on how to properly model this system Ill even take answers of dude, its a complex system but youre doing about the best you can do. p  pThanksp

The problems arep  ol liConstructor overloads cannot differ simply by explicit keyword, so we need an explicit constructor and implicit conversion operator or vice versa in the host class.li liExplicit constructor is better, because any constructor will call explicit constructors from initialization list even if is implicit itself.li liImplicit conversion operator cannot create objects of policy type because their destructor is protected.

OMP Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linke d into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause  incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenM P runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you  can set the environment variable KMPDUPLICATELIBOKTRUE to allow the program  to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrec t results.

Negative 1151 pFrom what Ive understood in the documentation, when i register a BroadcastReceiver using an intent filter in my manifest, the onReceive method will be called.

Is there a way to restrict the filtering by listening to the completed downloads that were enqueued by my application only If I try codeandroidexportedfalsecode it will not receive DownloadManager broadcasts, as they come from another application. If I filter the IDs my onReceive method is still called. What i want to achieve is avoiding that my receiver will receive ALL the events. Thank youp

And in other plist i store some datas likes high scores, statics, points that are needed to be refresh and saved with new values every time after a game over or when user buy new store accessories.p  pHow to handle for example a corrupt file because of a bad saving. I can make a copy every on the new plist every odd game played and have a files that can be reload and not losed but it seems to be a bad solution and stupid but i dont want to create an app where users can lost all the data because of a saved failure and start the game from the begining.p  pI read some links like this onea hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6544133savinggamescorelocallyoniosdeviceissecurityneededSaving game score locally on iOS device...is security neededa but i prefer to keep plist files than using NSUserDefaults because i have a lot of datas to save. p  pI think about a solution where the user can store a copy on the cloud of the plist like that  he delete the app it can have access to his preferences or if a failure saved to retrieve automatically a valid file but it seems weird and i never work on that kind of stuff.p  pI read more posts and i really need advices here and hope i dont duplicate a question.p

Negative 1151 pI am new to android application development and hence have serious troubles in getting my application running successfully. I guess most of my problems can be accounted due to lack of android platform concepts and usage of PC programming concepts on android p  pWhat I intend to do is to develop a UI based android application but I have a strong requirements that the application should behave like a daemon When I say daemon when the application starts, the UI should not be visible Based on certain wakeup event, the application show be woken up so that UI is visible to the user. Similarly based on certain sleep event, the application UI should be hidden. Something similar to the alarm application on android.p  pThe UI part was very easy for me because I used the Qt port for android and the application works like a charm. But this works like any normal application and does not include my requirement stated above. I tried looking Qt documentation and there is no provision to achieve this and in some forum, they have recommended to use android SDK methods to achieve this.p  pSince I am no Java expert, I read a lot about android development and managed to create an application which ,,somewhat satisfies the above requirement but I have few issues and I wanted to know if I have followed the right approach. So summarizing what I did below.p  ol liI subclassed android.app.Service and in my overriden onStartCommand, I am creating the worker thread that checks for the wakeup and sleep event. For discussion sake lets assume wakeup event is like every 60minutes and sleep event is like 5minutes after wakeup.li liWithin onStartCommand method, I am broadcasting an Intent expecting the activity that created my service to receive it step 6 below explains why I am doing thisli lipThe worker thread on satisfying a wakeup condition, starts my UI activity as followsp  pcodeIntent activityIntent  new IntentgetBaseContext, MyUIActivity.class activityIntent.addFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK getApplication.startActivityactivityIntentcodepli lipThe worker thread on satisfying a sleep condition, requests my UI activity to finish by broadcasting an Intent expecting the UI activity to receive it.pli liThe onStartCommand finally returns STARTNOTSTICKY.li liI have a main activity that registers an instance of BroadcastReceiver with an IntentFilter to receive the Intent after the service has been started from step 2 above. On receiving the Intent I call a finish to close the UI to daemonize my serviceli ol  pThe above setup works fine and I can see the service going in background with proper Toast messages and the UI also shows up when the wakeup condition is satisfied and the Qt widgets are displayed on screen perfectly. However, I have few issues in getting this setup work in a safe way. Below are the problems not sure if they are real problems or notp  pSometimes when I launch the app, I do not see the toast message that the service is started from the onStartCommand method but the logcat displays the following messagep  pcodeWActivityManager  628 Scheduling restart of crashed service org.example.myapp.MyService in 1000ms IActivityManager  628 START u0 flg0x10000000 cmporg.example.myapp.MyApplicationActivity has extras from pid 21764 WActivityManager  628 Permission Denial starting Intent  flg0x10000000 cmporg.example.myapp.MyApplicationActivity has extras  from null pid21764, uid2000 not exported from uid 10129codep  pWhen I try to start the application manually, it works finep  pSecindly, when I try to hide the UI activity by calling finish I think this is when I see the following messagep  pcodeIWindowState  628 WIN DEATH Window428ef138 u0 org.example.myapporg.example.myapp.MyApplicationActivity WActivityManager  628 Scheduling restart of crashed service org.example.myapp.MyService in 1000ms WWindowManager  628 Forceremoving child win Window41962f40 u0 SurfaceView from container Window428ef138 u0 org.example.myapporg.example.myapp.MyApplicationActivitycodep  pAfter this, the service is no longer activep  pFundamentally, my question is is this the right way of doing itp

Negative 1151 pI am trying to resize a UICollectionViewCell along only one axis without distorting its contents. p  pI have read answers for similar problems involving UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes  layoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPath and layoutAttributesForElementsInRect. I have also tried using initWithFrame and awakeFromNib in a UICollectionViewCell subclass. I have attempted to set UIViewContentMode to UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit or UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill in those methods, but that has had no effect.p  pSo far, I still get distorted text when I stretch along only one axis.p  pSo...p  pI have a UICollectionView with its cells defined in a xib. Currently the cell only contains a UILabel. The collection view uses UICollectionViewFlowLayout to do some minor customizationsp  precodeself.flowLayout  [[UICollectionViewFlowLayout alloc] init] [self.flowLayout setMinimumLineSpacing1.0f] [self.flowLayout setItemSizeCGSizeMakeself.cellSize.width, self.cellSize.height] [self.flowLayout setScrollDirectionUICollectionViewScrollDirectionVertical] [self.collectionView setCollectionViewLayoutself.flowLayout] codepre  pThe UICollectionView is embedded inside a UIScrollView, and fits exactly inside the scroll views dimensions.

Negative 1151 pId like to investigate the strong scaling of my parallel GPU code written with OpenACC. The concept of strong scaling with GPUs is  at least as far as I know  more murky than with CPUs. a hrefhttpbooks.google.chbooksiduQn1nnVoSzMCamppgPA64amplpgPA64ampdqstrongscalinggpuampsourceblampotsDVskav53OqampsigaVLEwxr5CQQnMHSZB5dLowVx0amphlenampsaXampeiZsxhVNbMHMHaOLbgeANampved0CEQQ6AEwBgvonepageampqstrong20scaling20gpuampffalse relnofollowThe only resource I found regarding strong scaling on GPUsa suggests fixing the problem size and increasing the number of GPUs. However, I believe there is some amount of strong scaling emwithinem GPUs, for example scaling over streaming multiprocessors in the Nvidia Kepler architecture.p  pThe intent of OpenACC and CUDA is to explicitly abstract away the hardware to the parallel programmer, constraining her to their threelevel programming model with gangs thread blocks, workers warps and vectors SIMT group of threads. It is my understanding that the CUDA model aims at offering scalability with respect to its thread blocks, which are independent and are mapped to SMXs. I therefore see two ways to investigate strong scaling with the GPUp  ol liFix the problem size, and set the thread block size and number of threads per block to an arbitrary constant number. Scale the number of thread blocks grid size.li liGiven additional knowledge on the underlying hardware e.g. CUDA compute capability, max warpsmultiprocessor, max thread blocksmultiprocessor, etc., set the thread block size and number of threads per block such that a block occupies an entire and single SMX. Therefore, scaling over thread blocks is equivalent to scaling over SMXs.li ol  pMy questions are is my train of thought regarding strong scaling on the GPU correctrelevant If so, is there a way to do 2 above within OpenACCp

Negative 1151 pIm working on a Android project and got a problem with the twopane layout list  detail.p  pCurrent statep  ul liWorking twopane layout like in GMailApp for screens with larger width than 600dp and landscape orientation.li liSwitching from twopane to singlepane layout worksli liWorking singlepane layout for devices with smaller width than 600dp in any orientation.li ul  pProblemp  pIf the userdevice screen width larger than 600dp is in portraitmode and selects a list item the detail view popups up which is correct. If the user now changes orientation to landscape the layout should change to twopane layout with the list and the selected detail view.

Negative 1151 pSocial Networks nowadays allow a user to set privacy settings for each post. For example in Facebook a user can set privacy setting of a status update to just me, friends, public etc. How would one design such a system in Neo4j no documentation on something like thisp  pOne way would be to set a property for each post. But this doesnt look scalable as this feature cannot be extended to something like share with group 1 Assuming users are allowed to create their own groups or circles in google.

The fact that the crash does not occur on development builds gives me hope that there is a workaround for the issue for release builds.p  pIs there some kind of processing done to remove codeltxliffggtcode tags from strings during a development build that does not get run during a release build Or is there something else going onp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI just discovered that if I run a release build twice, the crash does not occur.

Negative 1151 pIm trying to figure out an issue on a client website that has arisen in the past month or so, since the latest updates to both iOS and OSX. When users of Mac or iOS Safari are directed to any page in the site via a link in the EDM, they get caught in a constant loop of the page being refreshed. It also seems to leak memory between the refreshes, as Activity Monitor shows the Safari Web Content process for the site quickly grow in memory usage got to 4 GB in two minutes or so before I killed it.p  pThe issue can only be reproduced on the Safari browser. Chrome on Mac seems unaffected. Safari for Windows displays the refresh issue but does not seem to start hoarding memory, although the CPU usage of the WebKit2WebProcess.ee process sits at a rather high value continuously until the window is closed. I tried removing the utm parameters added to the EDM links one by one until I could confirm that the problem was caused by just utmsource on its own, then found that I should have expected that as its apparently the main tag GA looks for. More interesting is the fact that removing GA did not resolve the issue  I commented out the code creating the script tag for what its worth, the script in use was not the normal www.googleanalytics.comga.js but rather the DFP one from stats.g.doubleclick.netdc.js.p  pWhat does resolve the issue is not loading GPT  commenting the following codep  precodevar googletag  googletag       googletag.cmd  googletag.cmd  []     function          var gads  document.createElementscript         gads.async  true         gads.type  textjavascript         var useSSL  https  document.location.protocol         gads.src  useSSL  https  http  www.googletagservices.comtagjsgpt.js         var node document.getElementsByTagNamescript[0]         node.parentNode.insertBeforegads, node      codepre  pSo I am fairly sure that GPT is detecting the utmsource parameter and trying to do ...something... which on Safari fails for ...Some Reason... Unfortunately the GPT code is obfuscated and I am not likely to find my problem just reading it, so I was hoping there is maybe some method to get the call stack at the moment before the page is refreshed in Safaris developer console that I am not aware of, or some other debugging technique I havent thought of. Maybe someone else has even encountered this problemp  pAs far as I was aware the only script that cared about these parameters was Google Analytics, so I am also open to hearing I am heading down the garden path.p  pEDIT I tried uncommenting the GPT script tag and then commenting the one place on the page that we push a command to it with codegoogletag.cmd.pushcode in case our usage of it was causing the problems we essentially just define then publish 8 slots in the pushed cmd, then enable ad services. Commenting this command did not resolve the issue, it appears to be related to having loaded GPT at all.p

Negative 1151 pIm new to VBA and have been reading all about user defined functions and macros. Im hoping someone could help me out with a project. p  pI have a subscription to a service that pulls information into excel using an addin in the ribbon.

Negative 1151 pThis is my first question.p  pIm currently working on an iOS app in Swift. I was previously using three UITextFields for users to enter their data its a journaling app, but I hadnt realized that UITextField was limited to one line.p  pIve worked on getting three UITextViews to behave like UITextFields, except for one thing. I was using the code below to detect if the user pressed the return key so that they could begin typing in the next TextView like the way that the return key behaves with multiple TextFields.p  pMy one problem is that when the cursor moves down to the next TextView, it brings the new line n with it Ive tried many different ways to fix this and nothing seems to be working. Any ideas p  pThanks, Mattp  precodefunc textViewtextView UITextView, shouldChangeTextInRange NSRange, replacementText NSString      ifreplacementText  n          iftextView  firstTextView                       firstTextView.resignFirstResponder             secondTextView.becomeFirstResponder                   iftextView  secondTextView                      secondTextView.resignFirstResponder             thirdTextView.becomeFirstResponder                   iftextView  thirdTextView                      thirdTextView.resignFirstResponder                 codepre

Negative 1151 pIm trying to find a tool to parse and manipulate SCSS. What I need to do is programmatically merge two versions of SCSS files from different sources.p  pThe use cases involve files that only differ in declarations within the rules and not two totally different SCSS files.p  pFor example, if I have the following filesp  precode foosample.scss myColor fff body  backgroundcolor myColor margin 0    barsample.scss myColor ccc black 000 body  backgroundcolor myColor color black  codepre  pIt would be cool to have a tool in which you could do something likep  precodevar sass  requiresomesassparsinglib,   fooFile  sass.parsesource foosample.scss, otherOption value,   barFile  sass.parsesource barsample.scss, otherOption value  function findFooRuleSomehow      this would be implemented by the developer, not a part of the lib   function hasDeclaration rule, declaration     return wether rule has a declaration declaration   barFile.stylesheet.rules.forEachfunction barRule    var fooRule  findFooRuleSomehow    rule.declarations.forEachfunction barDeclaration      if hasDeclarationfooRule, barDeclaration        fooRule.declarations.appenddeclaration            do the same with variables, etc.   sass.savefooFile, resultsample.scss   produces the updated version of the SASS file not CSS codepre  pand produce something likep  precode resultsample.scss myColor fff black 000 body  backgroundcolor myColor color black margin 0  codepre  pWhich, for example, would allow you to merge only new declarations from codebarsample.scsscode into codefoosample.scsscode.p  pI found a hrefhttpsgithub.comreworkcsscss relnofollowcodereworkscsscodea which actually allows you to do a very similar behavior to what Im looking for but this one either a only works for CSS not SCSS or b I couldnt find what options to use so that it works for SCSS too.p  pThere is also a hrefhttpsgithub.comsassnodesass relnofollowcodenodesasscodea but it only renders the input to CSS, with no programmatic manipulation options.p  pDo you know any tool for this you can recommend or point me to A codenodejscodebased tool would be ideal but Im open to alternatives in coderubycode or codepythoncode.p

Negative 1151 pJust a warning, this is my first experience with any kind of html or php, so my apologies for complete oversight on my part.p  pMy problem is that Im using an html form to trigger an event, and the action script Im using doesnt seem to write to a file.p  pHeres the code for my html filep  precodelthtmlgtltbodygt       ltform actionaction.php methodpostgt             ltinput typesubmit valueTrigger this event.gt       ltformgt ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre  pAnd my php filep  precodeltphp file  status.txt fileputcontentsfile, 1 headerlocationindex.html gt codepre  pSo basically I want a file to be rewritten with just a 1 so that another program that loops serverside can read that file, take an action when it reads 1, rewrite the txt back to 0, loop. Theres no need for input from the user Im mostly using the submit button as a toggle.p  pWhen I run the php file from the command line, it rewrites the file just fine. When I click the submit button on the html site, the header function knocks me back to the index page, so I know that the browser is reading the php file. It just doesnt write to the file.p  pIf anyone sees the problem, or has an easier way to accomplish my goal preferably using php, please tell.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1151 pSimple question perhaps, but one Im having a hard time finding the answer to. I often work at a client that uses TFS as source control and they completely avoid using the baseless merge feature of TFS source control p  pIn part because in the past it required a command line tool to do it, but possibly more important because when you do it now in the interface it shows you a yellow exclamation warning symbol that you are indeed performing a baseless merge.p  pThis sort of scares them off and makes them avoid it altogether. Ive been searching around to figure out if there are any specific risks involved in baseless merges but Im unable to find that out or details on how baseless merges work underneath the hoodp

I have a page that submits data to a php page residing on a server, that php page echos back html to display which gets displayed in a div in the app on that same page. All works fine except that links to say google maps for directions open inapp. Because apple doesnt have a back button, I need the link to open in a system application like external browser, photo viewer, etc. instead of the inapp browser. I tried using system for target and other ideas like window.open, but nothing worked. All links still open in the inapp browser.

Negative 1151 pWhen using a component we specify how to validate it with a coderequiredcode, codemaxlengthcode or a codevalidatorcode and those validation are enforced on the server which is great.  p  pWhen using Primefaces codeinputMaskcode we can specify a mask.  The mask lead us to think that the user input will always match this mask.  Unfortunately this is not the case and we have to code a codevalidatorcode to make sure that the user input will be the way we want it to be.  So, unless I am missing something, the clientside only behavior of the codeinputMaskcode is just good enough to provide a hint to the user on how to fill a field.p  pIs there a emgenericem codevalidatorcode than can be paired with codepinputMaskcode to make sure that the user input is really matching the maskp
Negative 1151 pIn html Im using a codelttablegtlttrgtlttdgtcode to display a numbers of rows, each rows represents an album then between each row is another codelttrgtcode row containing a single codelttdgtcode, that in turn contains a codeltdivgtcode with stylenone. This row contains the list of tracks for the album in the line above, and can be toggled to display or not by clicking on a button on the album row. p  pThe trouble is that even when the div is hidden it takes up vertical height, I assume this is the height of the codelttrgtlttdgtcode, but how can I fix this. Or another thought can I make the codelttrgtcode hidden or can I only do that for divs.p  pnote as the code shows this is wrapped inside an Accordion div as well, but that is irrelevant to the questionp  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetUTF8gt ltlink hrefhttpfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilySourceSansPro400,400italic,600 relstylesheet typetextcssgt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstylesongkong.cssgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcstylejqueryjquery1.9.1.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcstylejqueryuijsjqueryui1.9.2.custom.jsgtltscriptgt ltlink relstylesheet hrefstylejqueryuicsssmoothnessjqueryui1.9.2.custom.css gt ltstylegt table  width100  th, td padding 5pxtextalign left ltstylegt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt function toggleMea var edocument.getElementByIda ifereturn true ife.style.displaynone e.style.displayblock  else e.style.displaynone  return true  ltscriptgt ltscriptgt     function       accordion0.accordion         active false,          collapsible true,         heightStyle content      ltscriptgt ltscriptgt     function       accordion1.accordion         active false,          collapsible true,         heightStyle content      ltscriptgt ltscriptgt     function       accordion2.accordion         active false,          collapsible true,         heightStyle content      ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltpgtLists all releases by  ltbgtFarming Incidentltbgt lta hrefhttpmusicbrainz.orgartist4302e2641cf04d1faca72a6f89e34b36gt4302e2641cf04d1faca72a6f89e34b36ltagt where they are credited as the album artist.ltpgt lt ReleaseGroupTypeAlbumgt lth3gtAlbumlth3gt ltdiv idaccordion1gt lt ReleaseGroupHeaderOur Glorious 5 Year Plangt lttablegtlttrgt lttd width60gt2005lttdgt lttd width400gtlta hrefhttpmusicbrainz.orgreleasegroup3056277977403b748a72d3ba6cf8e80dtargetblanktitleView MusicBrainz Release GroupgtOur Glorious 5 Year Planltagt lttdgt lttdgt1ampnbspltimg srcimagesmb32.pnggtlttdgt lttdgtlinked to 0ampnbspltimg srcimagesdiscogs32.pnggtlttdgt lttdgtfound possible links for 0ampnbspltimg srcimagesdiscogs32.pnggtlttdgt lttdgtAdditional 0ampnbspltimg srcimagesdiscogs32.pnggt lttdgtlttrgtlttablegt lt ReleaseGroupOur Glorious 5 Year Plangt ltdivgt ltpgt lt ReleaseGroupTableHeaderOur Glorious 5 Year Plangt lttablegtlttrgtlttdgtlta hrefhttpmusicbrainz.orgreleasegroup3056277977403b748a72d3ba6cf8e80dtitleOpen album in MusicBrainztargetblankgtltimg src....imagesmb32.pnggtltagt lttdgtlttrgtlttablegt lttablegtlttrgtlttd colspan12gtltbgtMusicBrainz Releases where no link to Discogs have been foundltbgtlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtltth width60gtActionsltthgt ltth width60gtYearltthgt ltth width200gtTitleltthgt ltth width50gtCountryltthgt ltth width100gtFormatltthgt ltth width120gtLabelltthgt ltth width100gtCat noltthgt ltth width200gtltthgt ltth width50gtltthgt ltth width100gtltthgt ltth width120gtltthgt ltth width100gtltthgt lttrgt lt Release Header1d9e8ed638934d3baa7d6cd79609e386gt lttrgtlttd width100gtltinput typebutton onclickreturn toggleMe1 valueTracksgtlttdgt lttd width20gtltimg srcimagesmb32.pnggtlttdgt lttd width60gt2005lttdgt lttd width200gtlta hrefhttpmusicbrainz.orgrelease1d9e8ed638934d3baa7d6cd79609e386targetblanktitleView MusicBrainz releasegtOur Glorious 5 Year Planltagt lttdgt lttd width50gtltimg srcimagesflagsflagsisoshiny32GB.pnggtlttdgt lttd width100gtCDlttdgt lttd width120gtWrath Recordslttdgt lttdgtWRATHCD25lttdgtlttrgt  lt Release1d9e8ed638934d3baa7d6cd79609e386gt lttrgtlttd colspan11gtltdiv id1 styledisplaynonegtltpgtCDltpgt lttablegt lttrgtltthgtltthgtltthgtTitleltthgtltthgtDurationltthgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgt1lttdgtlttdgtComplicitylttdgtlttdgt321lttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgt2lttdgtlttdgtWhen Your Political Ideology Has Gone Out of Fashion...lttdgtlttdgt143lttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgt3lttdgtlttdgtHyde Parklttdgtlttdgt409lttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgt4lttdgtlttdgtThe Harder You Fall, the Better Life Getslttdgtlttdgt249lttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgt5lttdgtlttdgtThe Equaliserlttdgtlttdgt537lttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgt6lttdgtlttdgtGravitational Lenzlttdgtlttdgt354lttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgt7lttdgtlttdgtMars Tranquilumlttdgtlttdgt632lttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgt8lttdgtlttdgtSputnik 8 Acelttdgtlttdgt452lttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgt9lttdgtlttdgtThe Flute of Shamelttdgtlttdgt215lttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgt10lttdgtlttdgtRostovlttdgtlttdgt700lttdgtlttrgt lttablegt ltdivgtlttdgt lttrgt lttablegt ltdivgt ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre

Negative 1151 pI exported some tables in my mySQL database on my own server localhost to a web host using phpMyAdmin. The tables contain swedish special characters, and the CHARSET is set to latin1swedishci. When imported, the characters look correctly in phpMyAdmin of the web host server, but when they are fetched and displayed on the web, there is a question mark inside a diamond instead of each special character.p  pIf I update the data by fething the data into a form and then manually replace the question marks with the special characters and submit thus updating the table, then the updated data shows correctly in the web when fetched.p  pBut if I do the same thing but using the same update form on my own server where the fetched data displays correctly both in phpMyAdmin and weblocalhost and setting the post attribute to the insert page on the web server, then that data does not display correctly on the web.p  pI.e. this is the opposite problem of that explained in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4777900howtodisplayutf8charactersinphpmyadminthis posta. p  pWhat might be wrongp  pEDIT As to the suggestion that using UTF8 all the way through might solve the problem My question more concerns how I might understand why a problem like this can occur. If the data looks ok in phpMyAdmin, does that mean that the problem lies simply in the fetching Or might there still be something wrong with the datap

Negative 1151 pI have activated Code Analysis CA in a build definition. It is linked to a custom rule set in the source control.p  pWhen the build completes, it reports something like 900 warnings. But if I have a look at the same build in the TFS SSAS database, it shows more than 4000 warnings which is more or less the number of warnings I have if I run the CA with the Microsoft All Rules rule set.p  pSo it would seem that the number of CA warnings in the SSAS database is taken from the unfiltered rule set instead of the custom one.p  pIs that a known behavior Is there something I have to change on the build process templatep

Negative 1151 pI have just come across the codeselectcode function for linux or is it Unix OSs. And its looking like it can achieve what I need to do. p  pI have a Linux process on Debian that has IPC InterProcess Communication between 3 other processes. 2 of them are Serial Ports Streams and the other is a Named Pipe.p  pMy process needs to read data from each of these streams and react accordingly its a proxy between these 3 processes. Theres no order to the data coming in from each process one may talk, then another lay silent for a while.p  pSo I am thinking of having a main loop that simply uses codeselectcode to listen on all streams with a timeout of never. That way select can notify me whenif a stream writes to my process, which stream is talking and then I can react accordingly.p  pIs this how select works Is this design ok and how you would handle 3 streams where their behaviour is dynamic and not predictable in terms of when they will write data to a stream p

The site is a hrefhttpwww.wtc.army.mil relnofollowhttpwww.wtc.army.mila  I have made some changes to the current live site and need to push them live, however when I render inside DW in IE 9, a few minor elements on the page will not render properly even though I havent changed these sections of the code these elements being social media icons at top right of page will not display, the glyphicons i think thats what theyre called next to some of links at the bottom wont display, and one other image next to a paragraph on the right side of the page. p  pI have compared the new code to the current live site and there are no differences within the code besides the minor changes that should not affect the failed elements I mentioned. The changes I have made should in no way affect these elements that are not displaying properly. Could DW be rendering the page differently then how it will show when I push it live, and these elements that arent rendering correctly in DW actually be fine when I push them live Another thing to note is that the new code works perfect in other browsers. its IE that is causing the issue. So my main question is Is it possible for DW to render the code in IE differently then how it appears when it is pushed livep

Negative 1151 pI have a project where I have embedded a JWT in the header of all calls to my RESTful web services.  The JWT includes all relevant user information name, username, roles, etc... and each of my WEB API controllers pulls it from the session headers and makes it available as a local private variable for use in endpoint specific authorization.p  pBut I need this information not just at the RESTful endpoints, I need it with each call to my database auditing.  Only, it doesnt seem elegant to pass the user object into every call and have those calls pass it along in its calls too.  p  pUltimately, I have an auditing component that is embedded in the guts of EF which logs every call to and from the database.  I want the user object attached to that so I have a clear audit trail which includes not just what was changed, but who changed it...  p  pIs there a way to make my user object which is grabbed by the constructor of the WEB API controller available to everything that may need it without injecting it into each call  p  pSession would have worked nicely, but the services are RESTful and subsequently, session is not available.p
Negative 1151 pI was asked to make a Subnet Scanner App for a summer class. The app is complete but its ugly as sin because the code is extremely lengthy.p  pIt is lengthy because the app requirements called for a gui with 8 ip addresses on them and whether or not there had been a return at that IP. p  pSince it required a GUI, I created a series of static text fields to represent the individual IPs it was scanning. p  pThat app has a scanner button and once that button is pressed and the scan resolves, it goes to update the board with the appropriate values. p  pTo make it easier, I set up a global placeholder value to just increment by 8 each time I needed to see a new set. p  pSo heres what Id like to dop  pId like to make a for loop that updates the static text of each of the eight fields without having to write each one out individually. p  pWhat I have that works is belowp  precodeself.XValue0.SetLabelstrplaceholder self.XValue1.SetLabelstrplaceholder1 self.XValue2.SetLabelstrplaceholder2 self.XValue3.SetLabelstrplaceholder3 self.XValue4.SetLabelstrplaceholder4 self.XValue5.SetLabelstrplaceholder5 self.XValue6.SetLabelstrplaceholder6 self.XValue7.SetLabelstrplaceholder7 codepre  pXValue is in reference to 192.168.1.X where X is the value being changed since the first part of the Subnet stays the same anyway. p  pThe placeholder with a number is in reference to a global value that adds the number 17 to the placeholder to populate the field. p  pFor instance, if the GUI starts at 192.168.1.0, it would populate down to 192.168.1.7 and display the yes or no for all positions in that range. p  pWhat I would like to do is something more similar to thisp  precodefor x in range0,7   PlaceholderValue  strplaceholder  x  XValue  XValue  PlaceholderValue  self.XValue.setLabelPlaceholderValue codepre  pHowever, when I do that, the console gives me an error saying it cant find XValue. p  pMy question is this. Is there a way to make that for loop work the way I want it to, or is it by necessity the longer code based on how I wrote it. Thanks all. Sorry for the long post, its my first question after lurking for ages. Please let me know if you all need anymore info. p

Negative 1151 pI have the requirement to add columns and I am not talking about adding rows To add listview columns as the user adds control records in a master table. The master table data rows then create additional columns in the slave item table which then populate the listview horizontally. As more columns are created the listview can be scrolled increasingly horizontal. Very similar to using a spreadsheet.p

Negative 1151 pIm a beginner to database design.  So I have two tables for implementing multiple choice, one called codeMCcode, for holding the questions, and codeMCchoicecode, for holding the choices for each question.  So codeMCchoicecode has a foreign key constrained to reference to codeMCcode.  So far, so good.p  pIn my 1st iteration, I stored the correct choice in the codeMCchoicecode table with a Boolean column.  And then I thought, hmm, theres some redundancy and potential update anomalies, and since which choice is correct is functionally dependent on the question itself, Im going to store the correct choice in the codeMCcode table itself.p  pSo I added a field in the codeMCcode table that is a foreign key constrained to pointing to codeMCchoicecode.  But now it becomes very difficult to insert new choices or questions because the two are now like recursively constrained.  I am using Rails and being a beginner in that as well I feel like this schema design is making my life quite unnecessarily difficult.p  p1 If I want to insist on this recursive foreign key reference, how do I save to the databasebr 2 Does this design make sense  I feel like the functional dependency argues for it, but seems so cumbersome in practice.br 3 Does ActiveRecord in Rails support this kind of operationbr 4 If the above schema is just silly, how should I be designing my tablesp  pThanksp

Negative 1151 pAlright this is one big problem in my opinion that Microsoft needs to address immediately. Steps to reproduce thisp  ppowershell InvokeWebRequest anywebsitewithcookies.com Lets do microsoft.com for examplep  pWhat happens is that you get the following warning a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comTR023.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comTR023.jpgap  pNow this is just stronghorriblestrong. Why Microsoft thinks this is acceptable is beyond me, however in strongWindows 8.1 there was a workaroundstrong. If you went intop  pControl Panel  Internet Options  Privacy a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comOSLS3.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comOSLS3.jpgap  pYou could set cookies to be accepted all the time. This was the only way to get rid of this message and still retain DOM parsing functionality. UseBasicParsing isnt a solution for me, because I want to use the functionality of what InvokeWebRequest returns without basic parsing.p  pHowever now in Windows 10 Microsoft decided to get rid of this slider for whatever reason i.stack.imgur.comjeNm3.jpgp  pThis problem can be reproduced on every Windows 10 machine and completely destroys how InvokeWebRequest can be used in a silent scripting environment, because the strongscript hangs and waits for the dialog to be answeredstrong. Is there a way to still set Cookies to be accepted for all like in 8.1 I tried every setting in Internet Options in Windows 10, but nothing holds the key. I believe they stopped using it and perhaps moved that setting elsewhere, but I cant find it. Microsoft Edge doesnt have many settings either, so none of them were helpful.p  pThis is just infuriating. Any help would be highly appreciated, as this will create quite a chaos in many environments.p

Negative 1151 pSo I have a home page that I created using HTML. I run it off my computer by opening the HTML file. Im trying to add a feature that allows me to edit it from the page using codecontenteditablecode or codeappendcode, not the source code. To achieve this, I came up with using codelocalStoragecode to hold the updated version of the webpage, and loading the page from that updated version. See a hrefhttpwww.developerdrive.com201206allowinguserstoedittextcontentwithhtml5 relnofollowherea. Theoretically, I would periodically update the source code from the codelocalStoragecode version so its all matched up.p  pHowever, when I tried it, my page wont update. I have a version saved into codelocalStoragecode, but it seems as if the program cant overwrite the that version, or something similar.p  pMy HTML looks like thisp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt  ltheadgt lttitlegtSCSS  Projectslttitlegt ltlink typetextcss relstylesheet hrefhome page heading style.cssgt ltlink typetextcss relstylesheet hrefhome page projects style.cssgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcsave script.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquery.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt   ltbody onloadcheckEditsgt ltdiv ideverythinggt  ltdiv classboxgt lta hrefwho am i.htmlgtltdiv classimggtltimg srcwho am i.png gtltdivgtltagt ltdiv classwrappergt     ltdiv classtitlegtWho Am Iltdivgt     ltdiv classdescriptiongtA project for English class describing who I am through different medias and explained by unit questions.ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classnotes contenteditabletruegtComplete.ltdivgt ltdivgt  lta href classbacktotop onclicksaveEditsgtSltagt  ltdivgtltEnd everythinggt ltbodygt codepre  pp  pMy JavaScript looks like thisp  precodefunction saveEdits   get the editable element var edited  document.getElementByIdeverything  get the edited element content var userVersion  edited.innerHTML  save the content to local storage var localStorage.Edits  userVersion    function checkEdits   find out if the user has previously saved edits iflocalStorage.Edits  null  document.getElementByIdeverything.innerHTML  localStorage.Edits   codepre  pBut my page doesnt actually work right it doesnt load the updated version. From viewing codelocalStoragecode, it seems as if its not even saving it properly.p  pWhy doesnt it work How can I fix it Is there something conceptually incorrect about my plan Any help would be appreciated thanksp
