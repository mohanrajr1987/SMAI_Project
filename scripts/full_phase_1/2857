Negative 2857 pThis question is not so much programming related as it is deployment related.p  pI find myself conversing a lot with the group in my company whose job it is to maintain our production Windows servers and deploy our code on them. For legal and compliance reasons, I do not have direct visibility or any control over the servers so the only way I can tell which versions of .NET are installed on any of them is through directions I give to that group. p  pSo far, all of the methods I can think of to tell which versions are installed check for Administrative Tools matching 1.1 or 2.0, check for the entries in the AddRemove Programs list, check for the existence of the directories under cWindowsMicrosoft.NET are flawed Ive seen at least one machine with 2.0 but no 2.0 entries under Administrative Tools  and that method tells you nothing about 3.0, the AddRemove Programs list can get out of sync with reality, and the existence of the directories doesnt necessarily mean anything.p  pGiven that I generally need to know these things are in place in advance discovering that oops, this one doesnt have all the versions and service packs you need doesnt really work well with short maintenance windows and I have to do the checking by proxy since I cant get on the servers directly, whats the foolproof way to tell which versions of .NET are installed on a production Windows Server Preferably some intrinsic way to do so using what the framework installs since it will be quicker and not need some sort of utility to be loaded and also a method which will definitely fail if the frameworks are not properly installed but still have files in place i.e., theres a directory and gacutil.exe is inded there but that version of the framework is not really installedp  pstrongEDITstrong In the absence of a good foolproof intrinsic way to do this built into the Frameworks, does anyone know of a good, lightweight, noinstallrequired program that can find this out I can imagine someone could easily write one but if one already exists, that would be even better.p

Negative 2857 pI saw a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1101462addingadditionalresourcestoamavenpomthis questiona and it motivated me to look again without success at Maven configurations for an alternative way of declaring configuration so it is appended to the parent POMs config instead of overriding it. In a Maven POM, if configuration declares the same elements as in the parent it overrides the parents configuration. As the accepted answer to the other question says, emthis is the expected behaviourem.p  pBut this is not always the emdesiredem behaviour. Should there beis there a means in Maven to add to rather than override configurationp  pFor example   Provide ability to declare elements of the configuration final, so that children can add to them but not replace   Allow child configuration to declare element as an addition, so it is merged with the parentp  phr p  pA good example of when the override behaviour is not always desirable is for the aspectLibraries element of the aspectjmavenplugin.p  pIn my parent POM I define a configuration for the aspectj plugin that declares a tracing jar to be used as an aspectLibrary.p  precode ltplugingt    ltgroupIdgtorg.codehaus.mojoltgroupIdgt    ltartifactIdgtaspectjmavenpluginltartifactIdgt    ltexecutionsgt      ltexecutiongt      ltidgtcompilewithaspectjltidgt        ltgoalsgt          ltgoalgtcompileltgoalgt        ltgoalsgt      ltexecutiongt    ltexecutionsgt    ltconfigurationgt      ltaspectLibrariesgt        ltaspectLibrarygt          ltgroupIdgtname.seller.richltgroupIdgt          ltartifactIdgttracingltartifactIdgt        ltaspectLibrarygt      ltaspectLibrariesgt    ltconfigurationgt    ltdependenciesgt      ltdependencygt        ltgroupIdgtaspectjltgroupIdgt        ltartifactIdgtaspectjtoolsltartifactIdgt        ltversiongt1.5.3ltversiongt      ltdependencygt    ltdependenciesgt ltplugingt codepre  pThis is inherited by all the child projects and I get tracing in all the projects, which is nice. However if I define another aspectLibrary in a child POM, it replaces my tracing configuration.p  pNote I have a workaround to this particular problem, Im interested in the general case and implications for Maven.p  pThe simple answer would be to redeclare the configuration for the tracing jar in the child POM as well as the new jar, but this has maintenance implications, and if I want to declare the tracing configuration in a profile so it can be disabled if needed which I do, I then need to reimplement the profile in the child.p  pThe dependency declaration in the above sample is merged with other dependency declarations in the parent and elsewhere. I know dependencies are a special case, but it shows that it is feasible to implement.p

Negative 2857 pI have 2 files that Id like to import into MS SQL. The first file is 2.2 GB and the second file is 24 GB worth of data. if you are curious this is a poker related look up tablep  pImporting them into MS SQL is not a problem. Thanks to SqlBulkCopy I was able to import the first file in just 10 minutes. My problem is, I dont know how the actual table schema should look like to allow me to do some very fast queries. My first naive attempt looks like thisp  preCREATE TABLE [dbo].[tblFlopHands]     [handid] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,     [flopindex] [smallint] NULL,     [handindex] [smallint] NULL,     [hs1] [real] NULL,     [ppot1] [real] NULL,     [hs2] [real] NULL,     [ppot2] [real] NULL,     [hs3] [real] NULL,     [ppot3] [real] NULL,     [hs4] [real] NULL,     [ppot4] [real] NULL,     [hs5] [real] NULL,     [ppot5] [real] NULL,     [hs6] [real] NULL,     [ppot6] [real] NULL,     [hs7] [real] NULL,     [ppot7] [real] NULL,     [hs8] [real] NULL,     [ppot8] [real] NULL,     [hs9] [real] NULL,     [ppot9] [real] NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PKtblFlopHands] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED       [handid] ASC WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY]pre  pThe flop index is a value from 1 to 22100 the first 3 common cards in texas holdem, 52 choose 3. Each flop index has a handindex from 1 to 1176 49 choose 2. So in total there are 25,989,600 rows in this table.p  pDoing a query with my above schema took approx. 25 seconds. After some googling I found out that the SQL server was doing a table scan, which is obviously a bad thing. I ran the Database Engine Tuning Advisor and it recommended to create an index on the flopindex column makes sense. After creating the index, the required disk spaces for the DB exactly doubled up plus the log LDF file grew by 2.6 GB But after the indexing, a query took only a couple of ms.p  pNow my question is, how should I do it the right way Ive never worked with such massive data, the databases I created before were a joke.p  pSome things to note After importing the data into MS SQL there will never ever be an insert or update of the data, just selects. So Im wondering if I even need a primary keyp  pstrongEDITstrong Im providing some more info to make my question more clearp  p1 Ill never ever use the handid. I only put it there because someone told me some long time ago that I should emalwaysem create a primary key for each table.p  p2 There will be basically only one query I will usep  preSELECT handindex, hs1, ppot1, hs2, ppot2, hs3, ppot3, hs4, ppot4, hs5, ppot5, hs6, ppot6, hs7, ppot7, hs8, ppot8, hs9, ppot9 WHERE flopindex  1...22100pre  pThis query will always return 1176 rows with the data I need.p  pstrongEDIT2strong Just to be more specific Yes this is static data. I have this data in a binary file. I have written a program to query this file with the data I need in just a few milliseconds. The reason I want this data in a database is that I want to be able to query the data from different computers in my network without the need to copy 25 GB on each computer.p  pHS means handstrength, it tells you the current hand strength of your hole cards combined with the flop or turn cards. ppot means positive potential, this is the chance that your hand will be ahead once the next common card is dealt. hs1 to 9 is the handstrength against 1 to 9 opponents. Same for ppot. Calculating ppot on the fly is very cpu intensive and takes a couple of minutes to calculate. I want to create a poker analysis program which gives me a list of every possible hole card combiniation on any give flopturn with their hsppot.p

Negative 2857 pI ve got a question regarding jBPM. In one of our projects I developed an enterprise service .Net that other systems jBPM, Delphi, etc. should receive data from. For this I am providing a SOAP interface.p  pNow theres a case that when the a jBPM system contacts the service, some manual work has to be done before the data the system needs can be returned. In this case, the SOAP service returns a ManualWorkTicketId. This id can then be used to poll the SOAP interface in lets say 1 minute intervals. As soon as the manual work has been done , the SOAP service is able to return the required data to the jBPM system. Since the enterprise service should not know about any systems and just provide a SOAP interface for communication, I see this as a good solution to handle the asnychronous part.p  pBut the jBPM developer told me that this isnt a good approach. Instead he suggests to write the information in an ActiveMQ queue, that I should listen to. When then manual work is done, I have to write back to another queue the jBPM system provided me, where the message then is consumed by the jBPM process.p  ol liquestion Since I am not a jbpm developer, I was wondering if there isnt a standard pattern to handle the web service polling part within jBPMli liquestion Which approach would you suggest in such cases keeping in mind that the enterprise service should be loosely coupledli ol

Negative 2857 pIve come across a system that is in use by a company that we are considering partnering with on a mediumsized for us, not them project.p  pThey have a web service that we will need to integrate with.p  pMy current understanding of proper usernamepassword management is that the username may be stored as plaintext in the database. Every user should have a unique pseudorandom salt, which may also be stored in plaintext. The text of their password must be concatenated with the salt and then this combined string may be hashed and stored in the database in an nvarchar field. So long as passwords are submitted to the website or web service over strongSSLstrong, everything should be just lovely.p  pFeel free to rip into my understanding as summarized above if Im wrong.p  pAnyway, back to the subject at hand. The WebService run by this potential partner doesnt accept username and password, which I had anticipated. Instead, it accepts two string fields named Username and PasswordHash. The PasswordHash value that I have been given does indeed look like a hash, and not just a value for a misnamed password field.p  pThis is raising a red flag for me.

Negative 2857 pI am working on a simple server that exposes webservices to clients. Some of the requests may take a long time to complete, and are logically broken into multiple steps. For such requests, it is required to report progress during execution. In addition, a new request may be initiated before a previous one completes, and it is required that both execute concurrently barring some systemspecific limitations.p  pI was thinking of having the server return a TaskId to its clients, and having the clients track the progress of the requests using the TaskId. I think this is a good approach, and I am left with the issue of how tasks are managed.p  pNever having used the TPL, I was thinking it would be a good way to approach this problem. Indeed, it allows me to run multiple tasks concurrently without having to manually manage threads. I can even create multistep tasks relatively easily using ContinueWith.p  pI cant come up with a good way of tracking a tasks progress, though. I realize that when my requests consist of a single step, then the step has to cooperatively report its state. This is something I would prefer to avoid at this point. However, when a request consists of multiple steps, I would like to know which step is currently executing and report progress accordingly. The only way I could come up with is extremely tiresomep  precodeTaskltintgt firstTask  new Task  gt  DoFirstStep return 3.14   firstTask. ContinueWithltintgt task gt  UpdateProgress50 return task.Result  . ContinueWithltstringgt task gt  DoSecondSteptask.Result return blah . ContinueWithltstringgt task gt  UpdateProgress100 return task.Result  . codepre  pAnd even this is not perfect since I would like the Task to store its own progress, instead of having UpdateProgress update some known location. Plus it has the obvious downside of having to change a lot of places when adding a new step since now the progress is 33, 66, 100 instead of 50, 100.p  pDoes anyone have a good solutionp  pThanksp

Negative 2857 pWe currently have a WinForms application that we want to slowly migrate to a web application.p  pOne screen is a time sheet entry system that uses DataWindow and is very slow and buggy. Anyway, the time sheet screen has five sections that are saved in real time.  A finished time sheet needs 25 of these sections.p  pCurrently, the system runs SLOW.  Some of our remote offices barely have a fracT1.p  pSo I want to redesign that screen using ASP.NET MVC2 and even provide some enhancements like autocomplete which it currently lacks, etc.p  pAny suggestions on best practices for a form that I emKNOWem will be highvolume AND run on possible slow networksp  pCurrently, there is a lot of roundtrip traffic because each section of the time sheet saves when they tab out of a field.  I would like to avoid this but I do admit the partial saves are cool.p  pAny suggestions or tips are appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 2857 pIm aware that there probably isnt a perfect solution to my question this sounds like a variation of the knapsack or the bin packing problem, but heres my scenario p  pI want to divide a list of SQL database tables into n lets say 7 roughly equallysized piles so I can spread some maintenance tasks roughly equally across an entire week. p  pLets say I have 100 tables this could be higher or lower, but not likely higher than 5000, ranging from size 1 to size 10,000,000 larger tables are much less common, of course.p  pMy original idea was to sort the tables alphabetically pseudorandomly then walk through from the beginning, moving to the next group when the total exceeds SumSize7. For some databases, this will probably work fine, but if two giant tables are right next to each other, then this makes for very unequal groups. This isnt as unlikely as it sounds, consider two huge tables, AccountHistory and AccountHistoryArchive.p  pAre there any generally accepted techniques for this, that give good results with a variety of source data Id lean toward a simpler technique rather than a more precise grouping if the maintenance runs slightly longer on some days than others, its not emthatem big of deal.p

Negative 2857 pI have an Nx1 array that corresponds to a probability distribution, i.e. the sum of the elements sums to 1.  This is represented as a regular numpy array.

We need to create an identical development instance of a database held on this server, including tables, triggers, default values, data, views, keys, constraints and indexes.p  pAs a temporary solution, I downloaded and installed SQL Server 2008 Express R2 along with the SQL Server 2008 Toolkit on a separate machine. I then used DTSWizard.exe and pointed it at the remote host as the data source and the local machine as the target.p  pTransfer of data at first appeared to be fine as the tables, indexes, etc. were created but after a little more digging, I realized it was NOT transferringsetting the default values of any fields Many of the fields have NOT NULL constraints and were interfacing with a COM API Response RCK which does not allow us to manually edit the queries so were stuck with how they have interface with the databaseinsert entries including the use of default values circumventing the NOT NULL constraints.p  pAs a second option we used the Generate Script option and exported all tables, constraints, indexes, default values, data, etc as a .SQL file but now Im not sure how to load this SQL file into SQL Server because it is 4.9GB  All of which is required, no circumventing the size of this monster.p  pSo my questions are  Is there a way I can make a complete copy of SQL database to another server including default values  Or is there a way to import a .SQL file without copying and pasting it as a New Queryp  pP.S Apologize if my Microsoft lingo is not perfect, Im a Linux guy familiar with PostgreSQL and mySQL.p

Negative 2857 pWithout getting into all of the gory details, I am trying to design a servicebased solution that will be consumed by several client applications.  The solution allows admins to create and modify document templates which are used by regular users to perform data entry.  It is my intent to make the application a learning tool for best practices, techniques, etc.p  pAnd, at the same time, I have to accomodate a schizophrenic environment because the powers that be cannot ever stick to their decisions regarding technologies and tools.  For example, I am using LinqtoSQL today because they arent ready to go to EF4 but there is also discussion about switching over to NHibernate.  So, I have to make the code as persistent ignorant as possible to minimize the work required should we change ORM tools.p  pAt this point, I am also limited to using the partial class approach to extend the LinqtoSQL classes so they implement interfaces defined in my business layer.  I cannot go with POCOs because management insists that we leverage all builtin tooling, etc. so I must support the LinqtoSQL designer.p  pThat said, my service interface has a StartSession method that accepts a template identifier in its signature.  The operation flows like thisp  ol liIf a session already exists in the database for the current user and specified template, update the record to show the current activity.  If not, create a new session object.br nbspli liThe session is associated with an instance of the template, call it the form.  So if the session is new, I need to retrieve the template information to create the new form, associate it with the session then save the session to the database.  On the other hand, if the session already existed, then I need to also load the form with the data entered by the user and stored in the session previously.br nbspli liFinally, the session with form definition and data is returned to the caller.br nbspli ol  pMy first objective is to create clean separation between the logical layers of my application.  The second is to maintain persistence ignorance as mentioned above.  Third, I have to be able to test everything so all dependencies must be externalized for easy mocking.  I am using Unity as an IoC tool to help in this area.p  pTo accomplish this, I have defined my service class and data contracts as needed to support the service interface.  The service class will have a dependency injected from the business layer that actually performs the work.  And heres where it has gotten messy for me.p  pIve been try to go the Unit of Work and Repository route to help with persistance ignorance. I have an ITemplateRepository and an ISessionRepository which I can access from my IUnitOfWork implementation.  The service class gets an instance of my SessionManager class in my BLL injected.  The SessionManager receives the IUnitOfWork implementation through constructor injection and will delegate all persistence to the UoW but I find myself playing a shell game with the various logic.p  pShould all of the logic described above be in the SessionManager class or perhaps the UoW implementation I want as little logic as possible in the repository implementations because changing the data access platform could result in unwanted changes to the application logic. Since my repository is working against an interface, how do I best go about creating the new session keeping in mind that a valid session has a reference to the template, er, form being used  Would it be better to still use POCOs even though I have to support the designer and use a tool like AutoMapper inside the repository implementation to handle translating the objectsp  pUghp  pI know I am just stuck in analysis paralysis so a little nudge is probably all I need.  What would be ideal would be if someone could provide an example how you would you would solve the problem given the business rules and architectural constraints Ive defined.p

Negative 2857 pSo I am doing pretty drastic rearranging of files through SVN. By drastic I mean moving dozens of folders at a time and creating dozens more. I am having a lot of trouble wrestling with SVN. Part of it is I keep forgetting to use svn mv and the other relevant svn commands. Part of this though is the built in tools find, xargs, etc... give me more power to do certain things. p  pTo make a long story short I keep getting situations where I move a directory and the source destination appears flagged as  and the new destination as  which makes sense. However, when I try to add the new destination marked  it says its already under subversion. I am assuming its .svn directory is causing problem but if I delete it then I get not a working copy error.p  pSo the higher level question is, am I stuck with svn mv, svn delete, svn mkdir, etc... I have searched and found references to gitsvn but it is not an option. Any advice for large rearranging of files via svn Is there an equivalent to something likep  pfind . type d name somefolder exec touch somefile p  pUsing svn commands to not cause trouble. Or more relevant, if Im doing edits like thesep  pmkdir p a,b,cd,efp  pHow do I do that using svn mkdirp  pThanks.p

Negative 2857 pSo as the title implies my question is a bit odd and complicated. I know what Im about to do breaks all the rules of good programming practices but hey, whats life if we dont live a littlep  pSo what I did was create the following program. Not this was part of a larger experiment to really try and understand generics so some of the function names maybe a bit out of orderp  precodeimport java.util.  public class GenericTestsClean       public static void test2              BigCageltAnimalgt animalCagenew BigCageltAnimalgt         BigCageltDoggt dogCagenew BigCageltDoggt         dogCage.addnew Dog         animalCage.addnew Cat         animalCage.addnew Dog         animalCage.printListdogCage         animalCage.printListanimalCage            public static void mainString [] args              What will this print         System.out.printlnnTest 2         test2         class BigCageltTgt extends CageltTgt       public static ltU extends Doggt void printListListltUgt list              System.out.printlnlist.getClass.toString         forObject obj  list             System.out.printlnBigCage obj.getClass.toString        class CageltTgt extends ArrayListltTgt      public static void printListListltgt list              System.out.printlnlist.getClass.toString         forObject obj  list             System.out.printlnCage obj.getClass.toString        class Animal   class Dog extends Animal   class Cat extends Animal   codepre  pNow what is confusing me is that this compiles fine with strongjavac 1.6.026strong but when I run it I get the following class cast exceptionp  precodeTest 2 class BigCage BigCage class Dog class BigCage Exception in thread main java.lang.ClassCastException Cat cannot be cast to Dog         at BigCage.printListGenericTestsClean.java31         at GenericTestsClean.test2GenericTestsClean.java13         at GenericTestsClean.mainGenericTestsClean.java21 codepre  pA number of things to note herep  ol liThe two printList are strongNOTstrong overriding but overloading each other as expectedThey have different types because the generic types of their arguments are different. This can be verified by using the Override annotationli liChanging the codevoid printListListltgtcode method in strongclass Cagestrong to be nonstatic generates an appropriate compile time errorli liChanging the method codevoid ltU extends Doggt printListListltUgtcode in strongclass BigCagestrong to codevoid ltUgt printListListltUgtcode generates an appropriate error.li liIn strongmainstrong calling strongprintListstrong through the strongclass BigCagestrong ie BigCage.printList... generates the same runtime errorli liIn strongmainstrong calling strongprintListstrong through the strongclass Cagestrong ie Cage.printList... works as expected only calling the version of strongprintListstrong in strongCagestrongli liIf I copy the definition for codeprintListListltgtcode to strongclass BigCagestrong from strongclass Cagestrong, which will hide the definition in strongclass Cagestrong, I get the appropriate compiler errorli ol  pNow if I had to take a shot in the dark as to what is going on here, Id say the compiler is screwing up because its working in multiple phases emType Checkingem and emOverloaded Method Resolutionem. During the type checking phase we get through the offending line because strongclass BigCagestrong inherited codevoid printListListltgtcode from codeclass Cagecode which will match any old List we throw at it, so sure we have a method that will work. However once it comes time to resolve with method to actually call we have a problem due to Type Erasure which causes both codeBigCage.printListcode and codeCage.printListcode to have the exact same signature. This means when compiler is looking for a match for codeanimalCage.printListanimalCagecode it will choose the first method it matches and if we assume it starts at the bottom with BigCage and works its why up to Object itll find codevoid ltU extends Doggt printListListltUgtcode first instead of the correct match codevoid printListListltgtcodep  pstrongNow for my real questionstrong How close to the truth am I here Is this a known bug Is this a bug at all I know how to get around this problem, this is more of an academic question.p  blockquote   pstrongEDITstrongp      pAs few people have posted below, this code will work in Eclipse.   My specific question deals with javac version 1.6.026. Also, Im not   sure if I completely agree with Eclipse in this case, even though it   works, because adding a codeprintListListltgtcode to strongBigCagestrong will   result in a compile time error in Eclipse and I cant see reason why   it should work when the same method is inherited verses manually   added See strongNote 6strong above.p blockquote

Negative 2857 pBackground In our project, we have a bunch of xml files that define tests that are loaded into a report generator. Since we want to make sure our tests stay accurate, we have data driven unit tests set up to test that the xml input produces the same output. This is currently held in a large excel spreadsheet, and works great with Visual Studios data driven unit tests. But, this leads to problems because often more than one developer will be working on tests, and they will need to get the spreadsheet to add the unit tests. If another developer has the spreadsheet, then they are stalled waiting on it to get checked back in since VS cant merge the excel file. In addition, we are wanting to switch to git, and this approach wont work well there either due to the lack of locking on checkouts and inability to merge binary files.p  pSo, we are trying to switch to having a separate file for each individual tests set of unit tests in a folder. Then, when the unit tests are run, we load up all the files in the folder and run the test data in each of the files. This way, when a developer makes a new test, they just have to add a new file for the unit tests, instead of having to add an entry to a central file.p  pThe data format is going to be the same across all the files, so really, even concatenating them together should work. But, Im trying to do this and retain the data driven behavior where each row in the test data is equivalent to one test in the output they all pass or failproduce output messages separately. p  pstrongIs it possible to run a data driven unit test off of multiple files If so, can we still retain the one row  one test style output in the resultsstrongp

Negative 2857 pI was reading about codeconsole.logcode somewhere on Stackoverflow earlier today, and I remember reading that it causes IE to bug out. The user had said that all instances of it should be removed from the code before deployment or a strongjavascript librarystrong could be used to omit it in IE.p  pMy question is regarding this second option, how would one write such a library Would it just be something thats run codeonloadcode that affects how the js is parsed from then forward Like something that says codeif browser  IE, omit all instances of console.logcode... or would it be an extension to the codeconsole.logcode method that makes it selfaware of what browser its being called in Im somewhat familiar with extending jQuery functions but have never seen this done with raw js.

Negative 2857 pI made my own small threadsafe confirmed it using many testslibrary similar to a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidosLooper.html relnofollowLoopera and Handler in Android for Java with some other extensions. All is perfect fine and it is performing quite well verified it by profiling. What it basically does is that every thread has its queue and the queue has an Handle. Using this handler every other thread can put runnable or callable in the queue. So just to check how it performs under heavy load, I made a small program where i generate 1000 threads and each thread posts 10 Runnables in all other threads i.e., 999 other threads and then finally every thread sens a shutdown request to every other thread. This works fine if i perform it for lt500 threads. Once I have more than 700, the program never ends and ultimately there is an OutOfMemoryError.

Negative 2857 pI often copy Mathematica code from websites such as SO to a notebook.  The code usually gets pasted as a single input cell.

Manual formatting i.e. the original newlines should preferably also be preserved this is not the case with default pasting.p  pGenerally, if one selects all input cells ALTclick, copies them into a text editor, then copies the resulting text back into a notebook, one should get a close equivalent of the original cells that were copied.p

Negative 2857 pIm having some issues with spanish characters displaying in an iOS app.  The code in question is all C, and shared between both a Windows app and an iOS app.  Compiled in Windows using Visual Studio 2010 character set is Multibyte.  And Compiled using Xcode 4.2 on the Mac.p  pCurrently, the code is using char pointers, and my first thought was that I need to switch over to wchart pointers instead.  However, I noticed that the Spanish characters I want to output display just fine in Windows using just char pointers.  This made me think those characters are a part of the multibyte character set and I dont need to go to all the trouble of updating everything to wchart until Im ready to do some Japanese, Russian, Arabic, etc. translations.p  pUnfortunatly, while the Spanish characters do display property in the Windows app, they do not display right once they hit the MaciOS.  Experimenting with wchart there, I see that they will display properly if I convert everything over.  But what I dont understand, and hoping someone can enlighten me as to the reason... is why are the characters perfectly valid on the Windows machine, same code, and dislaying as gibberish requiring wchart instead in the Mac environmentp  pIs visual studio doing something to my char pointers behind the scenes that the Mac is not doing  In other words, is the Microsoft environment simply being more forgiving to my architectural oversight when I used char pointers instead of wchartp  pSeeing as how I already know my answer is to convert from char pointers to wchart pointers, my real question then is Why does the Mac require wchart but in Windows I can use char for the same charactersp  pThanks.p

Negative 2857 pI am working with an unmanaged resource with C. The resource exposes a callback that can be setup for certain events that could happen within the hardware. To gain access to the unmanaged functions I do the followingp  precode[DllImportAttributetestDLL.dll, EntryPoint  InstallCallback] public static extern short InstallCallbackuint handle, byte x, byte y, IntFuncPtr ptr  [UnmanagedFunctionPointerCallingConvention.StdCall] public delegate void IntFuncPtruint handle, byte x, byte y, LogEntry info codepre  pI first install the callback with a reference to a method that follows the IntFuncPtr delegate. I then let the hardware go do its thing. After roughly 4700 calls of the callback the application crashes. The callback works fine if I write the code in cc however I can replicate it by removing the stdcall from my callback function. From C I cannot catch the error which indicates the application is dying in the unmanaged resource. With the cc application I can see that the stack overflows without stdcall.p  pI thought that the delegate might not work with the calling convention stdcall so I tried the followingp  precode[DllImportAttributetestDLL.dll, EntryPoint  InstallCallback] public static extern short InstallCallbackuint handle, byte x, byte y, IntPtr ptr  public delegate void IntFuncPtruint handle, byte x, byte y, LogEntry info  var callBackDelegate  new IntFuncPtrCallback var callBackPtr  Marshal.GetFunctionPointerForDelegatecallBackDelegate InstallCallbackhandle, 1, 1, callBackPtr codepre  pThis also did not work.p  pTo summarize, I have an unmanaged callback that requires a function pointer to a function defined as a stdcall. If the function pointer is to a non stdcall function then the stack grows and overflows.

Negative 2857 pI am working on a system, written in C, running on a Xeon on Linux, that needs to run as fast as possible. There is a large data structure basically an array of structs held in RAM, over 10 GB, and elements of it need to be accessed periodically. I want to revise the data structure to work with the systems caching mechanism as much as possible.p  pCurrently, accesses are done mostly randomly across the structure, and each time 14 32bit ints are read. It is a long time before another read occurs in the same place, so there is no benefit from the cache.p  pNow I know that when you read a byte from a random location in RAM, more than just that byte is brought into the cache. My question is how many bytes are brought in Is it 16, 32, 64, 4096 Is this called a cache linep  pI am looking to redesign the data structure to minimize random RAM accesses and work with the cache instead of against it. Knowing how many bytes are pulled into the cache on a random access will inform the design choices I make.p  pstrongUpdate October 2014strong Shortly after I posed the question above the project was put on hold. It has since resumed and based on suggestions in answers below, I performed some experiments around RAM access, because it seemed likely that TLB thrash was happening. I revised the program to run with huge pages 2MB instead of the standard 4KB, and observed a small speedup, about 2.5. I found great information about setting up for huge pages a hrefhttplwn.netArticles375098 relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpswiki.debian.orgHugepages relnofollowherea.p

Negative 2857 pI have a service that reads realtime sensor data. The data is read in sequence, 4 different types each about 50 ms apart. Actually the sensor data comes via bluetooth but is read out of the inputStream by the service.p  pNow it is crucial that the data is timestamped at its arrival with the most precision possible and thats where i have a problem with the gc. Should the gc kick in between reading data and timestamping it, even 20 ms lead to ugly results. Also it is crucial that the data never has larger gaps as i already have 200 ms between the same data types.p  pOn the other hand i want the data to be transfered in realtime to an app mini delay is ok. I managed to write the service so that it allocates all its objects in the beginning and never ever produces any trash for the GC. But for IPC i need to create parcelable objects to send them to the app.p  pQuestion 1 if i create such objects and send them via IPC to the app, on whos memory do they exist  As 2 processes dont share memory.p  pQuestion 2 does it cost me performance to use IPC  because i could simply make the service run in the same process and share the data 10 times more easily.p  pThe app will have GC, so if the service runs in the same process there is the danger of the GC disrupting the realtime data handling. However if i divide them into 2 processes im afraid that the IPC costs me some performance that may outweigh the GC trouble.p  pThe service only works for one single app, but should run as uninterrupted as possible AND deliver its data as realtime as possible. So put it in its own process or not p

Negative 2857 pI have a situation where I have a single Emitter object and a set of Receivers. The receivers are of the same class, and actually represent a set of devices of the same type. Im using the Qt framework.p  ul lipThe Emitter itself first gets a signal asking for information from one of the devices.pli lipIn the corresponding slot, the Emitter has to check to see which of the Receivers are ready, and then send its own signal to request data to one of the devices whichever is ready first. pli ul  pThe Emitter receives signals very quickly, on the order of milliseconds. There are three ways I can think of safely requesting data from only one of the devices the devices live in their own threads, so I need a threadsafe mechanism. The number of devices isnt static, and can change. The total number of devices is quite small definitely under 56.p  p1 Connect to all the devices when they are added or removed. Emit the one request and have the devices objects themselves filter out whether the request is for them using some specific device tag. This method is nice because the request slot where the check occurs will execute in a dedicated threads context, but wasteful as the number of devices go up.p  p2 Connect and disconnect from the object within the Emitter on the fly when its necessary to send a request.p  p3 Use QMetaObjectinvokeMethod when its necessary to send a request.p  pPerformance is important. Does anyone know which method is the best, or if theres a better one altogetherp  pRegardsp  pPrisp  pNote To clarify Emitter gets a signal from the application, to get info by querying the device.

The reverse proxy has the public address and redirects all incoming requests to the app server.p  pThe problem is, while all requests come in as codeexample.commyurlcode they are being rewritten and sent to the app server as code10.0.0.2myurlcode. This becomes a problem when e.g. devise comes into play by requiring authentication and redirecting to the login page. The redirect sent will include the local IP address instead of the FQDN that was originally requested.p  pAny idea how I can tell my Rails app to use a specific hostname in redirects Ive tried setting codeHTTPHOSTcode using codepassengersetcgiparamcode which didnt work and also tried to manually set coderequest.hostcode in a codebeforefiltercode.p

Negative 2857 pI was taught that in maths we evaluate things, with the acronym BODMAS Brackets, Orderspowers, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.p  pI understand that in Javascript, codecode and codecode have equal precedence. codecode and codecode do too. And left associativity is used.p  pFrom the few examples I can think of, it seems to work just as well, producing the same results as BODMAs.p  pIt looks like in the reality of the mathematical rules, sit doesnt matter whether addition or subtraction is done firsts. It can matter whether additional or subtraction can done first 523. And for division and multiplication, it seems like its only an issue when division is left of multiplication like code934code  then division must be done first. And Javascript does  first in that instance. p  pBut maybe there is an example where it breaks it Where it gives a different result to standard maths. p  pCan Javascript break logical mathematical rulesp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pTo answer myself, when in Mathematics one says, PEDMAS where D and M are equal precedence and done left to right. And ditto A and S.  You are saying theyre left associative, i.e. where the implied brackets are.  So programming languages that implement PEDMAS  the priorityprecedence, and DM and AS being left associative, are totally following the PEDMAS rule.   So, if there is any breaking of mathematical rules, it isnt from the associativity of M,D,A,S which is the same as in conventional mathematics. Also, in Mathematics, the unary minus is here  PEUDMAS  so 525225.  exponent takes priority over unary minus.   Though javascript probably gets that right.  Apparently floating points in javascript break rules, as shown in some answers, though that wasnt what I had in mind as what I had in mind was purely re PEDMAS, but it seems parentheses make a difference with floating point numbers, where they shouldnt in normal mathematics, as shown in the answer I accepted.p

Negative 2857 pIm new to generics and Java, and Stack Overflow, and there is a point in the textbook Im learning from where it discusses the implementation of a generic binary search tree excerpt below.p  blockquote   pThe Comparable interface is generic, so lets consider storing the following   type of elements in our search treep      plt T extends Comparablelt Tp      pThis still causes a problem. Suppose that both Dog and Cat are subclasses of a   class Mammal and that the Mammal class implements the Comparable interface.   Now if we create a binary search tree that stores Mammal objects, then a   Dog and Cat could be added, but are not really comparable to each other. So this   solution, if used in this particular way, has the same problem as using the nongeneric   version of Comparable.   A more comprehensive solution, though not as intellectually satisfying, is to   write the generic type asp      plt T extends Comparablelt  super Tp      pThis declaration restricts the comparable nature of the element to any superclass   of T.p blockquote  pSo I get why the type parameter needs to be codeComparablelt Tgtcode, but then the book claims that this can pose problems if the tree of codeMammalcodes contains different subtypes that attempt to invoke the codecompareTocode method on each other. Well if the reference type for the codeCatcode and codeDogcode objects in the tree is codeMammalcode, then wouldnt they be invoking codeMammalcodes codecompareTocode method anyway being codeComparablelt Mammalgtcode, making it a valid comparison just on the codeMammalcode levelp  pI dont understand what difference codeComparablelt  super Tgtcode makes, because would that not be the same thing, except perhaps if codeMammalcodes arent codeComparablecode then it falls back to a codeComparablecode superclass like the codeAnimalcode class or somethingp  pIm probably missing something, like some nasty consquence of type erasure or something that will cause the comparisons to not work like Im thinking they would.p  pThanks for your help Dp

Negative 2857 pIm studying some security related things and right now Im playing around with my own stack. What Im doing should be very trivial, Im not even trying to execute the stack, simply to show that I can get control over the instruction pointer on my 64bit system. I have turned off all protection mechanisms Im aware of just to be able to play with it NXbit, ASLR, also compiling with fnostackprotector z execstack. I dont have that much experience with 64bit assembly and after spending some time searching and experimenting myself Im wondering if anyone could shed some light on an issue Im experiencing.p  pI have a program source code below which simply copies a string into a stack resident buffer with no bounds checking. However when I overwrite with a series of 0x41 Im expecting to see the RIP be set to 0x4141414141414141, instead Im finding that my RBP gets set to this value. I do get a segmentation fault, but RIP does not get updated to this illegal value at the execution of the RET instruction, even if RSP is set to a legal value. I have even verified in GDB that there is readlable memory containing a series of 0x41s at RSP immediately prior to the RET instruction.p  pI was under the impression that the LEAVE instruction did p  pMOV ESP, EBPp  pPOP EBPp  pHowever on 64bit, the LEAVEQ instruction seems to do similar top  pMOV RBP, QWORD PTR [RSP]p  pIm thinking it does this simply from observing the contents of all registers before and after execution of this instruction. LEAVEQ seems to be just a context dependent name of the RET instruction though which GDBs disassembler gives it, as it is still just a 0xC9.p  pAnd the RET instruction seems to do something with the RBP register, perhaps dereferencing it I was under the impression that RET did similar top  pMOV RIP, QWORD PTR [RSP]p  pHowever like I mentioned, it seems to dereference RBP, Im thinking it does this because I get a segmentation fault when no other register seems to contain an illegal value.p  pSource code for the programp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  int vulnfunctionint

Negative 2857 pIm having an CSSproblem on my hands which I just cant seem to figure out. p  pMy goal is to achieve thisp  pThere is a very big div voyagescontainer, of 2190px width. Within that div, I have several smaller divs voyages, which contains more divs a fasecontainer with 4 fasedivs and underneath that an informationdiv, as wide as the fasecontainerdiv. p  pThe problem Im having is that the four fasedivs are not inline although the CSS says display inlineblock but underneath each other when they are displayed outside the scope of the superparent div which can scroll I want them next to each other, but I cant seem to fix it. They appear nice and neath when they are placed inside the scope of the parentdiv.  p  pTo illustrate Ive made a JSfiddle with two voyages. One is immediately in sight and works and the second one is more to the right. As you can see, this one isnt neath at all.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net8BCur1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net8BCur1ap  pWhat do I miss p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe point of the two voyagesdivs being far apart from each other is because the voyagesdiv and the timelinediv are inherent to time. The start of the div is 112012 and the end is exactly 5years later, with 1day4px. I retrieve the start date of a voyage from a database, and calculate the number of days between that date and 112012. That times 4 is the number of pixels the voyagediv needs to be left, relative to the voyageSdiv which is 7304px wide. p  pTherefor, float and block will not work, because now they lost their position which is the point of showing the voyagedivs  .p  pLater on, when this is working, Im making the divs resizabledraggable with jQuery so we can graphically plan stuff on the timeline. p

Ive tried thisp  precodeclass NameParser   def self.parsename     name  self.correctcasename     name  self.correctwhitespacename     name  self.removeextensionname     return name   end     def self.correctcasename ....   def self.correctwhitespacename ....   def self.removeextensionname .... end codepre  pIt looks HORRIFIC.  What can I do  Can anyone point me to a similar implementation somewhere on Githubp
Negative 2857 pIve got a Phonegap amp jQuery Mobile app that works nicely on Android and web. On iOS I am getting unexpected results, which seem to be caused by the fact that the document.pageinit event to which I bind the handler for most of the apps processes is fired twice.p  pNo, I didnt bind it twice. No, I didnt use document.ready. Yes, I did bind it to the document, early on in the script and not inside any other function.p  precodedocument.onpageinit,functionevent     alert Pageinit on document     Some more code  codepre  pThe first time it fires, the splash screen is still showing. At this point, while testing on a MacBook Pro with XCode, the console is not even avaiable the above message didnt show up in the console when I used console.log.p  pSecond time around, the fires shortly after jQueryMobile has created the first page.p  pWhat is causing this double firing and what can I do about itp  pEDIT I noticed later on that pageinit doesnt just fire a second time, but every time I open a new datarolepage div.

Negative 2857 pI have been using moles to write unit tests on the hard to reach parts of my code  particularly where I use the types found in the sitecore class libraries which are hard to use mocking frameworks with.

Moreover, it seems that whilst I am able to create a type of MField, when the implicit conversion happens, it will work and return an object but none of the fields are set to have any values.  This means, I cant test the code path above which relies on the state of the linkField being set a certain way.p  pThe only way I can think of setting these values is indirectly  i.e. finding what values need to be set by analysing the implicit conversion and setting these in MField.  The implicit operator calls the LinkField constructor as followsp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic LinkFieldField innerField  baseinnerField, link codepre  pwhich means I need to be conscious of how it instantiates the base type XmlField, and in turn that classs base type CustomField.

The query is run often enough a few times a day, but it is report in nature i.e. gathering data, it is not transactional. p  pAfter having a couple of people look at it we are mulling over a few different options. p  ol lipUsing OPTION FORCE ORDER and a few MERGE JOIN hints to get the optimizer to process the data more efficiently at least on the data that has been tested.pli lipUsing temp tables to break up the query so the optimizer isnt dealing with a very large query which is allowing it process it more efficiently. pli ol  pWe do not really have the option of doing a major schema change or anything, tuning the query is kind of the rallying point for this issue. p  pThe query hints option is performing a little better than the other option, but both options are acceptable in terms of performance at this point.p  pSo the question is, which would you prefer The query hints are viewed as slightly dangerous because it we are overriding the optimizer etc. The temp table solution needs to write out to the tempdb etc. p  pIn the past we have been able to see large performance gains using temp tables on our larger reporting queries but that has generally been for queries that are run less frequently than this query.p

Negative 2857 pI made a small application with java in Eclipse using SWT for my GUI. I set up the project by installing SWT Designer, which is very similar to Swing Designer only for SWT. I created the project by going to File  New  Other  Window Builder  SWT Designer  SWTJFace Java Project. This set up the whole project for me so I could start using SWT. My program successfully runs when I use Eclipse to run it. p  pI want to be able to run it without Eclipse, though. I tried to export it as a .jar by going File  Export  Java  JAR file. I selected my project, hit Next  Next, then I set my main class and hit finish. No errors.p  pOpening the .jar gave mep  blockquote   pException in thread main java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError orgeclipseswtwidgetsLayoutp blockquote  pIt was pretty clear that SWT isnt where it should be, so I opened the .jar and found only my files, the METAINF, etc. No SWT anything. No jar, no org folder, nada.p  pIn my Eclipse project, under the Project Explorer, it lists Referenced Libraries, where the SWT stuff is set up. When looking under the properties of it, it lists a bunch of org.eclipse... stuff. I assume this is how Eclipse knows what to run, but it seems to not export it.p  pstrongSo my question isstrong How do I get the project to export with SWT packaged with it, in order to be able to run by the .jar alone It would be nice if you could explain both the manual way i.e. editing the METAINF and dragging and dropping the required SWT files and also explain the Eclipse export way so I dont have to do the manual way all the time, if there is a way to do it in Eclipse.p  pstrongEDITstrong If you see my answer below, I explained how I was able to get this working, however, it dumps 16MB worth of code into my .jar, which is pretty big for an originally lt 1MB project. If you have any idea on how to make it only add the used files, an answer is still appreciated. p

Negative 2857 pIm trying to add file preview functionality to my Flex app.  I have a LinkButton in Flex that, when clicked, should open the file in a new browser window.

Im not asking for anyone to write the code for me, I just need a good place to start from a keyword, a javascript function to read about, something.p  pI would like to use a combination of HTML and Javascript to take the POST data and open the included file in the browser.p  pOther important information the file needs to be displayed in IE8 and the files being displayed are mostly image files, PDFs, or Word docs.p  pEdit Here is some info I forgot to mention.  The files I want to display are being stored in the database.  Im grabbing the file from there and storing in a custom class as a ByteArray.  I then pass the ByteArray to my helper class that formats the POST data request and stores the result in URLRequest.data.p  pHeres what my request looks likep  precodelljcuqjclcnyicgrmwexayhafmkhiwfx  ContentDisposition formdata nameFilename    arrows.png  lljcuqjclcnyicgrmwexayhafmkhiwfx  ContentDisposition formdata nameFiledata filenamearrows.png  ContentType imagepng    PNG  image information as ByteArray    lljcuqjclcnyicgrmwexayhafmkhiwfx  ContentDisposition formdata nameUpload    Submit Query  lljcuqjclcnyicgrmwexayhafmkhiwfx codepre  pSo Im looking for a way using Javascript and HTML ideally to handle that request and have the browser display the file or display an opensave dialog if the user doesnt have the proper plugins to display.p

Negative 2857 pI have a multiserver, multipart application I am moving to the cloud. I am using Elastic Load Balancing ELB to share load over instances of the same type and to handle port forwarding. ELBs even internal ones get a generated dns name and due to the implementation of ELB the ip is not reliable. The normal recommendation is to use Route 53, dyndns or similar to setup public aliases. This works nicely in most cases, and indeed, works for my external access to the load balancers. p  pMy problems comes as I want to reduce if not eliminate the configuration differences between the multiple VPCs I am using for devs, tests, staging and prod. I can do that if I am able to provide aliases for the ELBs for use within the VPC. p  pEssentially I want to set up CNAMEs for internal use only, but with a minimum of stuffing around. This means I needp  ul liEasy installation ideally RPMli liEasy configuration command line interface would be nice, or at least a small number of files. I will need to generate the config at create time to pickup the newly created ELB dns names.li ul  pI have looked atp  ul liBIND  The config is icky but if I can get a config file with emlt insert CNAMES hereem that would work.li liDnsmasq  nice config and I use it at home but major restrictions on CNAMEs means it isnt usable.li liTinyDNSdjbdns  Manual build and install, RPMs not available, and FAQ helpfully says  emCompiling djbdns yourself is trivial. If you feel you are not up to it, please reconsider if you should be administrating a name server.emli ul  pAny ideasp

Negative 2857 pI have the following situation I receive an Iterator of a certain type and would like to turn it into a particular map. I feel like there is probably a very easy way to do this but I just cannot seem to figure it out  Here is some code to make things easier to understand I shortened the case classes to a bare minimump  precodecase class Futitle String case class Barname String case class Matchf Fu, b Bar case class Resultname String, fus List[Fu]  val input Iterator[Match]  ... codepre  pWhat I would like to have in the end is something like thisp  precodeval output Iterator[Result] codepre  pHere is the tricky part The matches are unique, but naturally, each Fu could be matched so multiple Bars. I basically would like all the matches that have the same Bar to be disassembled and their Fus put into a list. Kind of like a Map[Bar, List[Fu]], except that I have a type for that. The Result class might as well use Bars instead of the name String but I really do not need the other Bar information. But that would not matter too much. And the output type is not all that important either, be it Iterator, Iterable, List, or anything else. As long as the mapping works properly.p  pAt first, I thought groupBy on Iterable would do exactly what I want but I can either not figure out how to use groupBy properly or it is the wrong function for the job  Using map seems to be a good start, but then how do I build the list I can easily turn each Match into a Result, but then I will end up with many Result objects with the same name...p  pThank you very much, any help is appreciatedp  pEdit Maybe I should make clear that it is not about matching the Strings. They are just example attributes for the two case classes. All Fus and Bars have already been matched properly into the Match objects.p

To do this, I know that the matrix and list are defined as output at the beginningfirst line of the function. Then, there is another function, F2 that takes these matrix and list for computation. BUT, it seems that the matrix and list are not loaded into the Scilabs environment. Does F1 not outputting the values or F2 which is not accepting the values  Im I doing it correctly Please help me out. Thanks for your support.  p

Negative 2857 pI have some javascript that generates an html string, then passes it to some more javascript that I do not control, where all whitespace is collapsed dont ask.p  pI would like to maintain my whitespace across this transformation, by changing the whitespace to a character Ive been using periods and using a span to set the text color to be the same as the background.  This text cant be highlighted, so this is a reasonably accurate whitespace substitute  p  pIm trying to develop a regex that will allow me to do a transformation like thisp  pcodea   b ccode  a...b.cp  pI know I can take care of the simple case by simply replacing every single space with the codeltspangt.ltspangtcode  like this codestr.replacesg,ltspan classwhitespacegt.ltspangtcode  but Id really prefer to remove the excess tags and match each group of whitespace instead of having an individual span tag for each space.p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p
Negative 2857 pI find it hard to believe there isnt an answer or tutorial for this, but am struggling to find one anywherep  pI have to and have build a multithreaded server to handle GET requests in C. For full marks this needs to use a thread pool. Currently my main thread accepts connections and passes them on to a new thread.p  pI can find a few implementations of thread pools in c online, but coming from a Java background understanding them is proving difficult. They also all seem to use a task queue. p  pThis seems unnecessary considering you can tell the listen call to queue connections. I saw somewhere that accept is thread safe saying that I also hear when POSIX says safe its more of a safeish Is this a sensible approach to take Or will the overhead be higher with each thread waiting on accept instead of stopping exection until passed a connectionp  pIf that is the case how in C would I go about doing this I presume i would need to keep a thread safe data structure storing pointers to each thread and a value indicating if they are busy or not And have some method to restart the thread and pass it a connection But I have no idea how to do this and cant find any simple tutorials on the internet.p  pAny advice or links to tutorials would be much appreciatedp  pThanksp

Negative 2857 pIm new to Node.js and I had a problem in customize validation message in node.js.I created a simple app with Compound JS using CRUD operation. In my app there is a field called id. The id field only accept integer value only. Then I validate the field by using the following code in modeluser.js. p  precodemodule.exports  function compound, User   var num  sds  User.validatesFormatOfid, with num, messageis not a number  codepre  pBy using the above code it work fine. But I also want to check whether the field is blank or not. Then I change the code a little bit. The modified code is look like thisp  precodemodule.exports  function compound, User       var num  sds      User.validatesFormatOfid, with num, message blank cant be blank, with is not a number      codepre  pThen the validation message if the field is blank will be displayed as this Id cant be blank. But when I enter the value in the id field other than numbers the validation error message will be Id [object Object]. I think the keyword with is not supported. Is here any other keyword like blank or min to use so I can get the validation message as Id is not a number.p  pI found a solution for this so the modified version of user.js is like thisp  precode module.exports  function compound, User       var num  sds      User.validatesPresenceOfid, message cant be blank      User.validatesFormatOfid, with num, messageis not a number      codepre  pThe problem with the above code is that it is displaying two validation message at the same time i.e. the default and custom blank message is displaying at the same time. My requirement is to show only one validation message for a field at a time. Is this possiblep

Negative 2857 pI have been working with Powershell for a time now, it is not the ideal programming environment, but got stuck with my program. p  pMy program is an GUI with a marquee progressbar and a search job. p  pWhat my program does After you run the script with Powershell it will restart Powershell in STA mode if the mode is MTA. After that it will ask for a folder location. After you entered the folder location it will start the search job and will search the location for files. Every file will be stored into an array. That array will be printed out into the tempfile.txt that will be saved on your desktop. Meanwhile the job is searching for the files the GUI will display a form with a Marquee Progress bar. p  pWhat my program needs to do After the job is finished with searching and storing the files it must close the form. p  pI have tried it to do with the formSearchingFiles.Close command but I have noticed Jobs can not close their parent thread, so this job will not be able to close the form. p  pI have also tried to solve it with the WaitJob cmdlet but then the Marquee Progress bar will freeze, or the form will not show up at all. p  pI have looked alot around internet for solutions but I can not find one that suits this problem. I was thinking about multiprocessing, but I do not know if this is possible in Powershell 2.0 I am limited to 2.0 or lower. p  pI also do not know if there is a way that the SearchJob can notify the main thread that it is finished with the task, so that the main thread can continue with the program, without freezing the progress bar.p  pI hope I have explained enough about the program and my problem. p  precode Get the path of the script scriptPath  SplitPath scriptMyInvocation.MyCommand.Path   scriptName  MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name script  scriptPath  scriptName   Check if powershell is running in STASingle Threaded Apartment or MTAMulti Threaded Apartment mode.

Negative 2857 pI am struggling trying to figure out how to implement a jquery UI date range form that will allow the modification of MySQL queries according to the inputted date range. Ideally, I would like to make my date range form introduce the new query data dynamically, without having to reload the page. I realize that the best and simplest way to do this is to use AJAX to send the form data to a backend PHP file. However, I am confused over how to use AJAX to modify existing queries. In my main frontend file, I have a date range form as follows p  precode        ltform idmyForm action methodpost namemyformgt             ltinput typetext class  datepicker idtxtStartDate placeholder  Start Date style  width  85px marginleft 10px margintop 1mmgt             ltbr gt             ltinput typetextclass  datepicker idtxtEndDate placeholder  End Date style  width  85px marginleft 10pxgt             ltbr gt             ltinput type  button name  submit value  Go style  marginleft 10pxgt         ltformgt codepre  pI am clearly yet to write the AJAX function, but thought it would help to show the MySQL query I would like to modify to include a date range feature. Here is what it looks like before the date range variables have been setp  precodeSELECT project, participant, reel, machine, qcgsr, qchr, qcacz, qcbre      FROM rtcdb.session      WHERE site  ORL001 codepre  pAnd this is what I would like it to look like after the date range PHP variables have been setp  precodeSELECT project, participant, reel, machine, qcgsr, qchr, qcacz, qcbre      FROM rtcdb.session      WHERE site  ORL001      AND downloaddate gt startdate      AND downloaddate lt enddate codepre  pSo all in all, I would like to use AJAX to send form date to a back end PHP script that either modifies or switches MySQL queryusage in the original file to select in terms of the set daterange. Thank you very much for viewing this question and for your insight. It is valuable to me.p
Negative 2857 pI have been trying to solve a routing problem, like the codeTSPcode traveling salesman problem but with some twists. I have modeled the problem using linearprogramming codeCPlex librarycode and a directed graph with an Origin vertex codeCoinOrLemon librarycode.p  pThe linear program finds the solution, but my question lies in how to retrieve the path. I can iterate each vertex and edge of the graph to find out which the linear program is using, so I thought Id just start on the Origin and use the chosen edges to get to next node until I reached the Origin again.p  pThe problem was that the CPlex path may walk through any vertex more than once. So I decided to use a recursive algorithm. But I cant quite figure it out.

Negative 2857 pI have an iPad app with InApp Purchase that used to host its content with Urban Airship a pox upon their house.  Now Im trying to convert this to use Apples hosted content.p  pIve created a .pkg file for one of my content items, and used Application Loader multiple times now to upload the content.   The package passed validation, I clicked Deliver, and I watched the progress bar as it was Uploading package to the iTunes Store.  In the Hosted Content tab for this item, Host Content with Apple is clearly checked, and the Hosted Content Package well shows the standard package icon.p  pYet, when I look at the same app on iTunes Connect, and go to InApp Purchases and view the same content item, it says Hosting Content with Apple This feature is turned off.  And no hints are provided here as to how one might turn it on.p  pIn my code, when I get back the SKProduct from StoreKit, I find that downloadContentVersion and downloadContentLengths are both nil.  And when I purchase it anyway using a test account, I get a SKPaymentTransaction whose .downloads is also nil.  And if I quit and relaunch Application Loader, the Host content with Apple checkbox is now unchecked.  This is all probably related to the fact that Apple doesnt realize they are now hosting this content.p  pPerhaps life is more difficult because this is not a new app or new content item both of these were approved long ago, and Im trying to update them to the new model.

Negative 2857 pI have been using iOS for the past couple of months and what i have been doing is when i Click Single View Application, a default View Controller would appear with an XIB. But with iOS 7, the XIB dont seem to appear, rather the storyboard appears. I have no idea how to work with Storyboards. I have neither used them in the past nor do i want to use them in the near Future. Do i always need to go ahead with an empty view and then add the relevant ViewControllersp  pPlease let me know if i am doing something silly or is it the new iOS 7 default behavior.p  pI did try to get into more details but could not get relevant answers on Google as well.p  pThank you.p

Negative 2857 pI am trying to get the max value of only two teams, there are several teams, but In my app I am trying to return the max value for the teams that are playing. They are set in a data attribute that I can access via jQuery. Below is my max variable.p  precodevar max  this.collection.maxfunctionplayer     return player.getpoints  codepre  pI tried using the codewherecode function after codethis.collectioncode and after codeplayercode just to test it, and obviously it isnt valid, I feel like the answer is right in front of me, Ive been through the docs, but I am not good enough with backbone.js yet to realize what I need to do here.p  pSo what I am asking is how can I filter this max function to be limited to only two teams.p  precodeLakers Heat Kings codepre  pThe teams that are playing are codeLakerscode and codeHeatcode set in the dataattribute, in the example below I am using a static string for the teams, I will substitute them for variables later, but I am more focused on the syntax. I am not sure how to do this, just some bad examples below.p  precodeBad example 1 var max  this.collection.whereteams Lakers, teams Heat.maxfunctionplayer      return player.getpoints   Bad example 2 ifthis.collection.whereteams Lakers  this.collection.whereteams Heat               var max  this.collection.maxfunctionplayer             return player.getpoints                            codepre  pI dont think the examples above are valid or technically make sense to the browser, but hopefully they help you understand what I am going forp  pThanks, ask questions if you need to, this should be pretty easy.p

Negative 2857 pIm working on a novelty detection project in Android using background subtraction. I would like to do simple classification after an object is detected e.g. Person, Dog, Car, Motorbike. I have read some literature on how to do this using e.g. Bag Of Words, Cascade classifier, but Im still not sure how to approach the task. Essentially, I want to store the novelty as an image and then label it into some sort of class  like Person, Dog, etc..or even match against a specific person, for example. The number of classes doesnt have to be too large  2 or 3 even. So my questions arep  p1 Whats the bestsimplest approach to do this CascadeBag of Wordsother methods   p  p2 How can I transport this classifier to my Android app, so that after I store the novelty as an image, I can just pass it to the classifier, which then applies a label.

Negative 2857 pI am trying to achieve the following in an MVC5 app.p  ol lipIn the MVC site root, the is a subdirectory Sites where static files live. For instance, there might be static assets HTML, JS, CSS for acme and it is located under Sitesacmepli lipIdeally, if you hit acme.localhost in my dev environment it will serve the contents of the Sitesacme location, defaulting to index.html. So basically everything on the subdomain of acme will be rewritten to be relative to Sitesacme. I have the DNS side of this all sorted out.pli lipI know the IIS URL Rewrite module is designed to do this scenario, however the catch is users can define their subdomain in my MVC app dynamically these are currently stored in a database. I dont know what they will be, and as far as I understand editing the rewriting in web.config if I were to do it this way will cause the parent MVC application pool to recycle. This makes me think it has to be some sort of HttpHandler that looks at a cached table of possible subdomains registered in the system and rewrites accordingly.pli ol  pAny thoughts or suggestions I was thinking a HTTP module or custom Route handler but not sure how to achieve this, and am very wary of doing this in an efficient way.p  pThanksp

Negative 2857 pIm using an iterative method to compute values of a vector. In each iteration the values in the vector change. After many iterations the values converges. I dont want to stop the iterationloop based on the number of iterations, rather I want to stop when the an error rate is below a specific threshold.p  pMy vector codeVcode has codencode elements.

Then I compute the difference between the two vectors, as codeE  Vnew  Voldcode. Where all vectors are codenumpycode arrays. So codeEcode here holds the differences between the old values and the new values. However at this point Im not able to know what to do with the codeEcode and how to use it to stop the loop. One way I thought to solve this is by summing all the elements of codeEcode and then stop the loop when the value of the sum is below a threshold, but that resulted in a zero as the result of the sum in the very first iteration because some elements were negatives and other positives. Now Im stuckp  pEdit I just thought of using the absolute value of codeEcode. p

Negative 2857 pI am in a situation where I have a nascent rest api architecture where each method has tons of ceremony validation, db connection acquisitionrelease, authentication, raw requestresponse objects as the parameters, and hardcoded json strings as the output. I want to use spring mvc to help with at least some of these issues auth amp db stuff ill need to hold off on. This would render a lot of the current architecture unnecessary. This is pretty easy except for one feature of the current architecture dynamically adding api calls.p  pThe entry point servlet for the architecture reads from an xml file that contains the path for a request and a corresponding class to load. The class must implement an interface that contains an execute method which has the logic for the request. The servlet calls this execute method after loading the class. This allows dynamic extension of the api as follows. The app is packaged as a jar together with the associated config xml files and given to a client. The client includes this jar in his project, creates a class that implements the aforementioned interface, and adds a mapping from request url to that class in the included xml file. He then runs the app and gets access to both the original api and his custom api.p  pExamplep  pClient is given app.war, interface.jar and custommappings.xml. app.war contains the implementation of the core api rest webservice, and interface.jar exposes the interface BaseController that has the method execute app.jar also uses this interface in its controller. Client then defines his own class as follows.p  precodepackage custapi.controllers  public class ExtendedController implements BaseController  public void executeHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response   LOGIC   codepre  pHe compiles this class and adds it to app.war. Next, he updates custommappings.xml with the following entry.p  pcustcallmycall custapi.controllers.ExtendedControllerp  pHe then deploys the app. The controller provided with the core api receives the request custcallmycall, looks it up in custommappings.xml, finds the class is custapi.controllers.ExtendedController, loads that class, and finally runs its execute method. This allows the logic defined by the client to be run.p  pIdealp  pCurrent architecture is replaced with springmvc. That is, there is no more super controller that parses requests and delegates to the appropriate class and, finally, method. Spring handles this. For the app that uses this new architecture, the client would receive the app.war and the spring mvc deps that expose controller annotations. The client would then create a new spring mvc controller taking advantage of validation, parameter  pojo mapping, object  json conversion, compile it, and add the resulting class file to app.war. His controller would then become an extension to the core api exposed by the app. When the app is deployed, he would be able to make a request custcallmycall like before and have it execute the logic he defined. This ideal scenario allows clean code for the core api which I and others programmed and an extended api. A downside to this approach is that the client is tied to spring. In an even more ideal scenario, the client would use frameworkagnostic annotations which are mapped to spring annotations by the app. Im not sure how easy this would be.p  pIm not sure how the above would be realized with a springaware controller without sacrificing the benefits of spring. I dont believe the client could simply define another springaware controller correct me if Im wrong on this. The only solution I can think of is to have a springaware controller that has a wildcard path e.g., custrest which acts exactly the same as the current controller. The client would not get any advantages that spring has to offer, but the core api would be a lot cleaner. I was hoping there was a better solution, however. Ideally the client would get the benefits of spring without having access to the core api source code. Any ideas on this, or is my solution the best that can be hoped forp  pThanks. p  pNOTE For both scenarios, I am only guessing how the client actually gains access to the dependenciesinterfaces and deploys. I have only had access to the core api project for one day, and so my understanding of it is not complete.p  pRelated a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19920912runtimeloadingofcontrollersforspringmvcanddynamicallymappingrequestsuRuntime loading of Controllers for Spring MVC and dynamically mapping requestsURLsap  pThe above question looks pretty similar to mine. Replies are sparse second one is just off topic, I believe.p

Negative 2857 pIm working with a firm realtime system the result will be unuseful if served after the deadline which requires maximum throughput and robustness to load.p  pMore details about our system, we are processing telecommunication messages. The messages will go through several step with different concerns. However strongthe messages orderstrong is very important. The steps are like thesep  ol liQuery something from Redis inmemory databaseli liQuery something from another relational inmemory databaseli liSome business logic computional processingli liUpdate data into Oracle RDBMSli liSend messages to other server through Socketsli ol  pWe are currently setup a system with a distributor and 8 processing units which runs through the messages sequentially on only 1 server. We decided to maximize the performance per unit first, before doing horizontal scale.p  pIve tried several approaches im only passing the messages through the first two steps and some data collecting logicp  ol liProactor pattern by implementing the eventloop and highlevel asynchronous API with callbacks by myself using Java API. However, the performance is not as expected, the messages are not in order.li liSEDA the overall performance is good when im using a threadpool for each stage. However, to preserve the message order, I tried using only a thread per stage, the performance is even worse than the Proactor pattern.li liLMAX Disruptor the default batching characteristic brings both the latency and throughput down because I find it a bit hard to apply batching to our current business logic. When I avoid using batching, the performance is ok now, however, its only about 1.5x faster than the sequential approach even im using a thread for each handler, so its 3 threadli liA naive multithreading approach using a BlockingQueue  some worker threads, the performance is better than I expected. 1.752X faster than the LMAX Disruptor approach. I find it a little bit counterlogic here...li ol  pSo, have i done anything wrong with my approaches above Does the eventdriven architecture really fit our need for a high throughput, firm realtime systemp  pPS Its my first time asking a question on Stackoverflow, so please give me advices if therere any problems with my questions D.

Negative 2857 pSo I essentially have a WYSIWIG editor on a website.p  pI want to be able to tell if a user is currently editing a page, to prevent other users from entering it while it is busy. p  pI implemented a system that marked articles as busy in mySQL. When a user would enter the page to edit it, it would mark it as busy, and it would be unmarked by binding a function to strongwindow.onbeforeunloadstrong. p  pHowever, window.onbeforeunload does not get called if the page is closed unexpectedly, such as if the browser crashes or is force closed. This results in some articles being marked as busy when they shouldnt be. p  pIs there a more proper way to implement thisp

Negative 2857 pIve developed an IIS HTTP module that does dynamic image resizing. It looks at the incoming URL and performs a regex to determine if the URL is a match for that images that we want to resize, and pulls out the requested image size thumbnail, large etc. It then checks for a cached version of this particular image size on disk, then either outputs that, or if not found it resizes the source image to the requested size, saves it to disk and then outputs that file. The crux of the code is herep  precode        context.Response.WriteFilefile         context.Response.End codepre  pHowever this always brings back a HTTP status code of 200, and never 304s on subsequent requests. Instead, I thought it would be better to instead just make my module change the virtual path of where other HTTP Handlers would see the file request and they can do their own thing, such as caching etc. I tried using HttpContext.RewritePath but this caused 500 errors, possibly because of the point belowp  pMy image folder lives outside of the website root directory. I dont want them in web root because somebody could perhaps request the source images. This image resizing system only allows images of a certain maximum size.p

Negative 2857 pI have a LCD that I use to display timecode of the movie I am watching on my XBMC, and I would like to display current date and hour when nothing is played. The machine hosting the LCD is running a python strongTCPSocketServerstrong server receiving text to be displayed from my XBMC installation. The problem is that I have to keep an active network connection so XBMC can send the hour and date through the socket and the LCD can display it.

Negative 2857 pI want to copy all the files and sub directories from a directory to a different directory. However I only want to copy them if they are not already in the destination directory or if the timestamp on the source directory file is newer than the timestamp on the destination directory. I am having troubles getting into all of the sub directories. I am able to get down one level but not the next. For example, with directory abc, I am able to get to sub directory b but not to c. The only way I could see doing this was with a recursive function. My code is below.p  precodebinbash   SOURCEDIRhomekyleSmaugcsis252  DESTDIRhomekyleDesktopcsis252  copy      local DIRECTORY1     for FILE in ls DIRECTORY     do         if [ f DIRECTORYFILE ]         then             echo FILE file             cp DIRECTORYFILE DESTDIRDIRECTORYFILE         fi         if [ d FILE ]         then             echo FILE directory             mkdir DESTDIRDIRECTORYFILE             copy DIRECTORYFILE         fi         done    cd SOURCEDIR  copy . codepre  pI forgot the DIRECTORY in the second if statement. I feel stupid now but sometimes it just takes someone else to read through to find stuff like this.  I did not use the cp r SOURCEDIR DESTDIR because this would copy everything and sometimes I do not want that. I tried the cp ur SOURCEDIR DESTDIR but it would only copy new stuff over, not update the existing stuff. The final version of my code is below.p  precodebinbash  SOURCEDIRhomekyleSmaugcsis252  DESTDIRhomekyleDesktopcsis252  copy      local DIRECTORY1     for FILE in ls DIRECTORY     do         if [  f DESTDIRDIRECTORYFILE ] ampamp [  d DESTDIRDIRECTORYFILE ]         then         if [ f DIRECTORYFILE ]         then             echo DIRECTORYFILE copied             cp DIRECTORYFILE DESTDIRDIRECTORYFILE         fi         if [ d DIRECTORYFILE ]         then             echo DIRECTORYFILE directory made             mkdir DESTDIRDIRECTORYFILE             copy DIRECTORYFILE         fi     else         if [ DESTDIRDIRECTORYFILE nt DIRECTORYFILE ] ampamp [  d DIRECTORYFILE ]         then             cp DIRECTORYFILE DESTDIRDIRECTORYFILE             echo DIRECTORYFILE updated         fi     fi     done   cd SOURCEDIR copy . codepre

Negative 2857 pIm using a custom Loader to load data for a listview in a listfragment. In the listfragments oncreate method I construct a custom arrayadapter and call setListAdapter, without passing in any data, because at that time the data has not been loaded yet. When the loader has finished loading, the fragment gets notified there I call setData, which is a method in the adapter to add the data to the adapterp  precodepublic void setDataListltMyInfogt data      clear     if data  null      for MyInfo item  data      additem             codepre  pIm pasting this method because I may be missing something here.p  pWhen I run the app, the data is loaded allright, setData is executing but the getView method of the adapter never gets called. However when I remove the TextView with the standard androidididandroidempty from my custom layout file, my list is showing up. I guess the adapters constructor is inflating the empty textview right in the beginning, before the data has been loaded, and the TextView doesnt get replaced by the ListView once the loader has finished loading.p  pWhat should I do to get the empty TextView replaced by the ListView when loading has finishedp  pOr, maybe this is bad practice  Im an Android newbie so please forgive me. I want to have the listfragment show at least something, during the first loading, but also when the loaded list is empty. Then what is good practice in this casep

Negative 2857 pI have a project that Im working on to automate a load process into an externally hosted application.  The vendor provides web services with the required import methods but were running into a few issues.  For one, the link to our web service is directly tied to our login page which is HTTPS.  But, the URLs within the WSDL file are HTTP.  For this reason we cannot load the web service into a .NET solution the traditional way because it cannot access the URLs.  The vendor explains this as being a result of having application load balanced on their servers.p  pRegardless of why it doesnt work to link to the URL the vendor has provided us the XML of the WSDL.  What were trying to do is generate a class from the XMLWSDL in .NET so that we can consume the web service.p  pThe usual error returned is akin top  blockquote   pThere was no endpoint listening at endpoint set it app.config that could accept the   message.

Negative 2857 pIve several times developed applications with very large branched or linked structures of small objects lt 1kb each, either 1 simply creating the objects or 2 creating and accessing them.p  pIn both instances, the application either stops completely or outright throws OutOfMemory once the physically available RAM us used up.p  pMy understanding is that once physical RAM is exhausted, paging should occur, and, while very slow, the program should continue to work. In particular I am neither trying to allocate large objects, nor am I using arrays or lists of more than 2g objects Im not sure if that limit still applies nowadays.p  pI wrote a little test program which continuously allocated and stored 1GB blocks of memory. Since .NET seemed to delay the allocation, I also filled the blocks with data. I found that .NET correctly paged out to disk once RAM was used up, and the program became noticeably slower, but never crashed or OOMed.p  pSo, why does .NET seem to have trouble with a lot of small objects Is this particular to my configurationp
Negative 2857 pSo I have an excel file, with some VBA code in it. The problematic bit is that I need to sort a lot of data by barcode number first, then by Date of visit each barcode visits multiple times. p  pThis all works fine with random test data that I generated. It gets all sorted by barcode, then by date from latest to earliest.Greatp  pBut not, when I try to use actual data, it doesnt the barcode gets sorted all right but not the date. The actual data will come from an Android app Xscan that has strongCSV files as outputstrong.p  pUnfortunately, the data exports looks like this 21102014. When I try to have it sorted, it only sorts it according to the very first number, not as a date not very useful... so no matter what the month is, if the day is 31 st, itll be place highest.p  pI have tried the following changing datatype back amp forth, and run the code with datatype set to different things, but it still doesnt work.p  pHow can I make Excel understand that strong21102014strong is to be read as a date, even though it comes from a CSV file and looks like a stringweird divisionp  pIdeally, the solution could be coded into VBA somehow... Im dealing with very lowtech skills users.... p  pEDIT See screenshot below the column I need to sort by is column H. It doesnt matter if I set data type to Number, date, general.... Still does the same. As for the codep  precodeFunction sortingallmySheet As Worksheet, myRangeRow As Range, myRangeCol As Range, secondSort As String Dim myCol As Range Set myCol  getColmySheet, secondSort mySheet.RangeA1, mySheet.CellsmyRangeRow.Row, myRangeCol.Column.Sort key1mySheet.RangeA1, order1xlAscending, key2mySheet.RangeColumnsmyCol.Column.Address, order2xlDescending, HeaderxlYes, OrientationxlSortColumns  End Function codepre  pThe barcode is in column A and always will be, hence the hardcode I know I know. Thats the key1. Key2 is the date of visit though the function is called to sort other things, hence the secondsort variabel.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSsGUO.png altenter image description herep  pFurther EDIT So apparently the output file from the application isnt really saved as a .CSV even though thats what the app claims, it is saved as a Excel 972003 file. If I copypast from that file, it doesnt work. If I saved the file as a CSV properly, THEN copypast from it.... it works. Not gonna lie, I hate Excel. Not builtin function to change this from the app. So the heart of the matter might be between the Excel 972003 file format amp my Excel 2010 file that I use... In any case it does seem that importing the data through VBA will be the best answer.p

Negative 2857 pThere is a file server I have been asked to clean up Pentium 4 with 512 meg of ram. It gets files added to a directory structure that consists of a few provinces, within each province directory are town directories, within each town directory are are newspaper directories, within each newspaper directory are story directories, and within each story directory are are files named by a  string consisting of topic and date. So each file looks like this water poisons yak 20130411.doc, malaria peak 20120105, etc. I have to filter this collection for story directories that are inactive no contributions within 3 years. The collection is to be filtered once a month. About 1000 new files get added every month. The collection has 80,000 files.p  pMy solution is to run through each story directory and check the name of each file with thisp  precodeSub LoopThroughFilesstoryfolder     Dim MyObj As Object, MySource As Object, file As Variant    file  Dirstoryfolder    While file ltgt        If InStrfile, 2013 Or InStrfile, 2014 gt 0 Then          MsgBox recent file found. move on to next directory          recentDir  True          Exit Sub       End If      file  Dir   Wend End Sub codepre  pThis checks if the year 2013 or 2014 are in the filename. If those years are not found,then I run through the story folder again checking for the year 2012 and the month in a similar way. If a month more recent than the current one is not found, then that whole story directory is moved. In Visual Basic, this is accomplished by changing the pathname of every file in that particular story directory. So this means I run through the story folder Again a third time, this time assigning a different pathname to each file. p  pMy question has to do with the correct design of this algorithm to be efficient. To know if a folder can be archived, the filenames of its contents have to be inspected. If I loop through the whole collection in the beginning and load it into an array to make the subsequent searches faster  then I will need a ton of memory. On the other hand, looping through each directory three times seems wasteful. I feel like this question should have been solved already so I ask.p  pAlthough I have to use visual basic, the principles behind this question are fundamental and applicable to any language. Do not hesitate to reply in another computer language in English though.p
Negative 2857 pIm totally new to the ZK framework and Im not sure if the information Ive provided would be enough or not. p  pIm aware that, if there is a fixed number of categories, then in the code.zulcode file  for each codeGroupboxcode, a codeListboxcode can be displayed.p  pCurrently, I have a list of users being displayed categorically i.e there is a dynamic number categories and each category has dynamic number of users.

Negative 2857 pIm running through some samples on Asp.net Web Api 2 and the project I will eventually be working on is going to utilise AngularJs. A couple of the databinding scenarios Im working on will have angulars codewatchcode implemented and as I understand it, having the codedeepcode flag set to true on this function will notify of new and old values, but not at the property level  only at the array object level. The ultimate goal is to be able to isolate a property change and send this change as a codePATCHcode request to Web Api rather than send the entire object as a PUT request.p  pThe sample I have is currently using knockoutJs and the approach has a model that represents the data where the property values that need to be watched are set as codeobservablepropNamecode. My question is basically whether or not I can convert the following knockoutJs code to something similar in Angularp  precode  self.watchModel  function model, callback      for var key in model        if model.hasOwnPropertykey ampamp ko.isObservablemodel[key]          self.subscribeToPropertymodel, key, function key, val            callbackmodel, key, val                            self.subscribeToProperty  function model, key, callback      model[key].subscribefunction val        callbackkey, val         codepre  pwith the model looking something similar to the followingp  precodevar obsEmployee       Id employee.Id,     Name ko.observableemployee.Name,     Email ko.observableemployee.Email,     Salary ko.observableemployee.Salary,    codepre  pIm sure that theres either an equivalent method available in Angular, or the difference in implementation is significant enough that there is another approach.p

I write a simple test program and compile which works as expected, but when I run it throws up an array index out of bounds exception.  After further digging I also know that if I comment out this linep  precode arrayIn[j]  DUPLICATEREMOVE codepre  pthen the program works as expected. So the exception is being thrown from this line. I also have changed the statement to have the constant displayed instead, i.ep  precodearrayIn[j]  7 codepre  pThe int temp was also an experiment as before the if condition read asp  precode if arrayIn[j]  arrayIn[j] codepre  pwhich I thought could have been throwing the error.

The current structure is like thisp  precodeabstract class Module      public abstract void run     public String chsum    abstract class SimpleGame extends Module       not that important    class GameX extends SimpleGame      public void run           some magic        codepre  pAnd when needed, upon receiving the proper message the network stack might call something likep  precodeGameX gx  new GameX String checkSum  gx.chsum codepre  pMy current progress got me nowhere, I tried to access the .class file but without any luck  it works only if it is not a jar archive. And I need to supply the codeClasscode instance which is not a dealbreaker but it sure is not that handy. If I could get an array of bytes containing the compiled code.classcode file that would be more than enough  to perform a checksum on that is a piece of cake using a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavase6docsapijavasecurityMessageDigest.html relnofollowMessageDigestap

Negative 2857 pGitFlow is a very popular branching model that has become somewhat of an industry standard a hrefhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodel relnofollowhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodela.  In addition to maintain workflow consistency with the open source community and control repository access Forking Workflow as used where the primary repository is locked down and all contributors work from forked repositories. Nonadmins file pull requests for merging their forked repo changes and admins review and merge that code. This can be done with private organization repositories as well. a hrefhttpswww.atlassian.comgittutorialscomparingworkflowsforkingworkflow relnofollowhttpswww.atlassian.comgittutorialscomparingworkflowsforkingworkflowa  Forking Workflow and GitFlow are used in conjunction to manage software projects.p  pMy question is around collaboration while using the Forking Workflow.  When multiple engineers need to collaborate on the same feature and have made progress how do they share the code  With GitFlow its easy to just push a feature branch where team members can conveniently work together.  The problem is that with Forking Workflow it requires someone to accept pull requests before the code is merged and accessible to all the feature collaborators.  How do feature collaborators contribute to the same inprogress feature without requiring the attention of someone to constantly accept pull requestsp

Negative 2857 pIm trying to edit an xml file in labVIEW for use by a .NET assembly later on in the program, however, when labview saves the file it changes the encoding. This prevents the .NET assembly from being able to open the file, since it needs to be in UTF16 or UCS2.   p  pIs there a way to change the encoding in labview I can do it manually in notepad but obviously that wontt work when Im actually trying to use the program. Ive tried using the labview write to xml file.vi which allows you to specify an encoding, but it just erases most of the file. Im sorry if Im being a bit vague here.p  pIve included a link to a drive folder with 3 xml files, which should be almost the same at least they are when view in notepad, not so much in drive, however the one called working can be loaded into my .NET assembly and  the one called postLabviewEdit cannot. Notice that both have the same encoding declaration UTF16. If I take the one that isnt working postLabviewEdit and open it in notepad and click encodingEncode in UCS2 Little Endian and save it it starts working again I included this one as well.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJyLJt.png altenter image description herep  pa hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfolderviewid0B8FWPOKsn2tXYXc1MXpjMU1CaGsampuspsharing relnofollowXML files before and after running through the programap

Negative 2857 pIn our system there were 2 distributed computers on the same network, each having their own ActiveMQ broker. One of them broker1  had only the consumer role, and other  was producing some data on some status topics. We set the ActiveMQ configuration to multicast so that we didnt need to know the IP addresses of the brokers. As youll see we will add some other consumers step by step and this is where our problems begin We produce some data at broker2 and monitor them in broker1. Everything was fine. p  pThan we added a chat feature. We created a chat topic and both broker1 and broker2 registered to chat as producer and consumer. This worked fine also. p  pAfter that, we decided to add a new computer broker3. We set its ActiveMQ configuration to multicast also. Problem is that, broker3 sends some data to status topics and they can be seen at broker1, but when it comes to chat, again all the messages produced for chat are seen by broker1 and broker2 but broker3 only consumes the messages produced by itself. It cant consume the messages on chat produced by broker1 and broker2. We set the ActiveMQ configuration of broker3 to static, added both broker1 and broker2 addresses as network connector. This time, broker3 started to monitor the messages coming from itself and from broker1, but it couldnt monitor the messages coming from broker2. By the way, broker1 and broker2 works the way exactly as we wanted all the time.p  pAnd as this problem wasnt enough, we added one more computer as broker4 to the network. Neither in multicast nor in static configuration, it could  consume the chat messages. Again it only consumed the messages produced by itself. And the data sent by broker4  to status topics could be seen by broker1. p  pHeres the configuration of the computersp  ul listrongbroker1strong Windows 7, 32 bit, 1.6 JVM, ActiveMQ 5.8.0li listrongbroker2strong Windows 7, 64 bit, 1.6 32 bit  JVM, ActiveMQ 5.8.0 registered as 32 bit serviceli listrongbroker3strong Windows XP, 32 bit, 1.6 JVM, ActiveMQ 5.8.0li listrongbroker4strong Windows 7, 64 bit, 1.6 32 bit JVM, ActiveMQ 5.8.0 registered as 32 bit serviceli ul  pAs you seen we gave unique names for the brokers, and we turned off Windows firewall on all of the computers I dont know if it was related or not but I did.  I also tried registering ActiveMQ service as 64 bit for broker4, but it also didnt work.p  pAnd about the network, in our company theres a DHCP server, and I have a mini hub on my desk. All the computers I mentioned in scenarios above were obtaining dynamic IP address from the server. When I go through these problems, I pluggedout the server cable from the hub and set all the computers IP addresses as static. But nothing changed. As I said I dont know if these were related but I tried it anyway.p  pI dont know if Im missing something or doing something wrong. So any help will be appreciated.p  pRegards, Ekipp

It seems that setting codeNODEENVproductioncode is the culprit, since it has a side effect I didnt anticipate  it make loopback launch with 4 worker nodes instead of just a single process, and this overwhelms the memory provided by Heroku. Im renaming my datasources.production.json to datasources.live.json and setting codeNODEENVlivecode to see whether the problem goes away.p

Negative 2857 pScenario We have an API that we are building an Angular single page app for, and we require multiple tenants. Each tenant has specific access credentials that allow them to interact with their database. But I have to allow for the tenant to take this SPA and host it on their own website if they choose to, which is why I have made it a very generic Angular SPA. We cannot expose the security credentials to the API in JavaScript, so it takes a server side component. I am using MVC routing to interpret which tenant the user is going to, then it acquires a session token and passes it to the JavaScript so the SPA will function using that token.p  pNormally, with this scenario if you are using Razor, you can just use bundling or the virtual directory  in your JavaScript src attribute. However, since it is pure HTML, it has no clue what  means.p  pHere is the routes I have for the tenantp  precode        routes.MapRoute             name Default,             url tenantNamecontrolleractionid,             defaults new  controller  Home, action  Index, id  UrlParameter.Optional           codepre  pSo a typical URL will look likep  precodehttplocalhost51982Tenant2Home codepre  pWith the JavaScript src referencingp  precodeltscript srcScriptsangular.min.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pOf course, this causes the URL to look likep  precodehttplocalhost51982Tenant2Scriptsangular.min.js codepre  pWhich will result in a 404 error. Now, if I change it top  precode    ltscript srcScriptsangular.min.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pIt will work because it goes to the root of the site. That is great, up until I have to deploy it to as a Web Application rather than a website likep  precodehttplocalhost51982WebApp1Tenant2Home codepre  pSo ideally, Im trying to find a way to force MVC to strip out the Tenant identifier of the URL if the reference goes to an actual file name. The only way I can find that it will work is that I have to just use Scriptsxxxx.js and so the site will only work when set up as a Website and not a Web Application. I was hoping someone might have come across this unique scenario before. p

Negative 2857 pIs what Ive done below a sensible approach to allow callbacks to run on functions defined in an objects prototype, such that the scope is correctp  pIve been wrestling with the correct way to set the value of codethiscode when an objects prototype method is the one to run in response to a callback which might originate from an ajax request or from a click binding or whatever.p  pHere is a simplified annotated versionp  precode everything is inside an object which provides the namespace for the app  var namespace     a fairly vanilla object creation routing, which uses the prototype  approach for defining the functions on the object  newObj  functionparams      var MyObj  functionparams          this.property  params.property          MyObj.prototype  namespace.ObjPrototype     return new MyObjparams ,   the prototype itself, which defines 2 related functions  ObjPrototype         The first is called to do some form of asynchronous operation      In this case it is an ajax call      doAsync function params          .ajax             type get,             url params.url,             data params.data,             dataType params.datatype,             success namespace.objClosurethis, asyncSuccess, [data],                    the final line above is the key here  it asks a function below          for a closure around this, which will in turn run the           function asyncSuccess defined next with the argument data     ,       This is the actual callback that I want to run.  But we cant      pass this.asyncSuccess to the ajax function above, because the      scope at execution time is all wrong      asyncSuccess  functionparams          this.property  params.data     , ,   This is the bit I sort of invented, to help me around this problem.  It returns a function which provides a closure around the object  and when that returned function is run it inspects the requested  arguments, and maps them to the values in the JS default  arguments variable to build a parameters object which is then  passed to the function on the object  objClosure  functionobj, fn, args      return function          if args              var params               for var i  0 i lt args.length i                  params[args[i]]  arguments[i]                          obj[fn]params          else              obj[fn]                   codepre  pNow, obviously the actual target callback codeMyObj.asyncSuccesscode needs to know that its going to get a params object, and what structure it will be, and that knowledge has to be shared by the invoking function codeMyObj.doAsynccode, but otherwise this seems to work well.p  pMy question is  am I totally mad  Have I missed something obvious that would solve this problem for me in a simplerless convoluted way  Am I just too far down the rabbit hole by this stagep  pIve read around a lot of questions on SO and they have all addressed part of my question, but I dont seem to have got to the bottom of a generally accepted solution for this.  I cant be the only person whos ever wanted to do this p  pstrongEditstrongp  pIve accepted the answer below, but you need to read all the comments too for it to come together.

Negative 2857 pI am trying to use mysqliinsertid to rename a file so my program can create more than one file. Instead it just creates one file with an id of 0 and each time it overwrites that file instead of creating a new one. I am wondering if I need to increment mysliinsertid or something. p  pBut basically I want each file to be named the jobid.fasta. Right now they all are 0.fasta.p  pI am confused because when I use mysqliinsertid for my insert statement it correctly assigns jobids to each new job. So when I SELECT  FROM Job I get a huge list of all the jobs 1100. I want the files that are created from a job to be called the jobid instead of just 0.p  pHere is the code that I have.p  precodeltphp ifissetPOST[submit]       echo submit1             declare variables to what the user defines them as              db  POST[database]             evalue  POST[evalue]             sequence  POST[BlastSearch]             hits  POST[hits]               insert the values into the database                create a new .fasta file and put the sequence the user wants to search for in that file             file  uploads.mysqligtinsertid..fasta             current  POST[BlastSearch]             fileputcontentsfile, current              execute the BLAST Tool              Do this execute statement if the user inputs his own sequence.

Negative 2857 pI have a list of intervals defined as a list of tuples. I am currently looping through the entire list of intervals and comparing each one to check if a value is in coverage.

Negative 2857 pSo I am currently working on some game elements including some enginelike stuff in OpenGL and I have come to this problem. dealing with 3D world I am getting the angles of rotation in the world by mouse, like thisp  precodeint prevX  mouse.x int prevY  mouse.y  GetCursorPosampmouse  cam.xRot  atanprevXmouse.x cam.yRot  atanprevYmouse.y codepre  pSeems working good. the xRot is in fact meant like rotation around Y axis and yRot around x axis Camera rotation is good. Then I started to work on movement relative to the camera. After some drawings and desperate attempts I came to thisp  precodeW if keys[57]                    cam.z  cosangleYcosangleXcam.speed            cam.x  cosangleYsinangleXcam.speed            cam.y  sinangleY         S if keys[53]                   cam.z  cosangleYcosangleXcam.speed           cam.x  cosangleYsinangleXcam.speed           cam.y  sinangleY         A if keys[41]                   cam.z  sinangleXcam.speed           cam.x  cosangleXcam.speed         D if keys[44]                   cam.z  cosangleYsinangleXcam.speed           cam.x  cosangleYcosangleXcam.speed         codepre  pIt works too but the problem is when I rotate the camera around z axis the depth one. I tried some combinations etc but nothing seems to be working. What am I missing I made the equations above like this When I take it as a 2D just x and z and I want to go forward with camera rotated by zero angle I need to move only in the z axis direction, in a positive way so lets use a function with its maximum there  cos. When I rotate by 90 and need to move forward I need to move on x axis so lets use sin cause we need the opposite. That handles 2D well.  Now I needed to add z axis so I though that maybe just restrict the values of x and y by cos of the second angle yRot or angle of rotation around x if you want and make sin of it the actual movement on y axis. Yea working good but as I said problems when I rotate around z and basically switch the y and x axis. What to do with it Dp  pOh by the way I have read some other tutorials and I noticed that some people use a different ways with vectors etc. What is a common way in todays games I dont really like using goniometric functions so often. Maybe my approach is not the best one huhp

Negative 2857 pIn an app I am currently working on on Android, OpenGL 3.0, I have a complex, large object with about 8000090000 vertices and hundreds of thousands of triangles. This object exists along with a lot of other, significantly smaller and less complex objects. p  pWith 8000090000 vertices, I had to use GLUNSIGNEDINT and an IntBuffer for the index data, and initially, I used these parameters for drawElements and called drawElements once. The object rendered correctly, but my fps was visibly and significantly decreased. I took a wild shot at correcting the issue and basically broke up that one drawElements call into 6 drawElements calls, breaking up my IntBuffer into 6 pieces. So this is how my code lookedp  pInitiallyp  pcodeGLES30.glDrawElementsGLES30.GLTRIANGLES, indices.length, GLES30.GLUNSIGNEDINT, indexBuffercodep  pAfter my changep  pcodeGLES30.glDrawElementsGLES30.GLTRIANGLES, indices.length6, GLES30.GLUNSIGNEDINT, indexBuffers[0]codep  pcodeGLES30.glDrawElementsGLES30.GLTRIANGLES, indices.length6, GLES30.GLUNSIGNEDINT, indexBuffers[1]codep  pcodeGLES30.glDrawElementsGLES30.GLTRIANGLES, indices.length6, GLES30.GLUNSIGNEDINT, indexBuffers[2]codep  pcodeGLES30.glDrawElementsGLES30.GLTRIANGLES, indices.length6, GLES30.GLUNSIGNEDINT, indexBuffers[3]codep  pcodeGLES30.glDrawElementsGLES30.GLTRIANGLES, indices.length6, GLES30.GLUNSIGNEDINT, indexBuffers[4]codep  pcodeGLES30.glDrawElementsGLES30.GLTRIANGLES, indices.length6, GLES30.GLUNSIGNEDINT, indexBuffers[5]codep  pWhere indexBuffers[] is an array of IntBuffers containing my IntBuffer split up into 6 pieces.p  pSomehow, breaking up the drawElements call sped up my app, and my fps greatly improved. p  pWhy is this the case Can anyone explain why breaking up the call but still making each call one after another successively is faster than make one big call Does it have something to do with the thread mechanisms of OpenGLp  pMy completely uneducated, wild guess, is that making a drawElements call is like starting a new thread. Therefore, splitting the call will divide the work amongst a set of threads. Is this correctp

Negative 2857 pI have written a small Javascript script for AdWords, which loops through several campaigns and adgroups of multiple accounts and then saves the results.p  pWhile the script works perfectly fine, I want to store the complete results once the looping is finished and send it off as an email, and I have a hard time making it work.p  pThe code looks like thisp  precodefunction main  MccApp.accounts.withIds[arr1,arr2,...,arrX]..executeInParallelabc, afterProcessAllClientAccounts   function abc   Select campaigns, adgroups and loop through them...  Now comes the somewhat critical part  var n  0  whileaditer.hasNext    n   aditer.next   ifn lt 4  Logger.logCampaign   ag.getCampaign    AdGroup   ag.getName    Ads   n     function afterProcessAllClientAccountsresults  for var i  0 i lt results.length i  var result  results[i].getReturnValue Logger.logresult   codepre  pNow I would like to send an email with the multiline codeLogger.logcode output once the looping is done and I run into problems. AdWords Apps Script has a prebuilt mailing methodp  precodeMailApp.sendEmailrecipient, subject, body codepre  pIf I put it into the helper function, I get an email every time a loop is finished for one of the array elements, at the same time I did not find a valid way to put it in the main function as the outputing happens in the helper function. p  pHence how can I aggregate the output and store it in a variable that is callable from within the main function p  pbrp  pstrongEDITstrong I have added the codeafterProcessAllClientAccountscode function to the code. Calling it like this, the final codeLogger.logcode output simply gives me the last specified result of each codeadGroupcode loop of the codeaccountcode. Hence for codencode rows of codearr[n]code, I get either a proper output or simply codeundefinedcode. The problem is that the while codeadGroupcode loop seems to reset the logger completely. Another solution I tried today was pushing each log result in the codeif n lt 4code statement to an array as suchp  precodevar test  []  function main  foo   function abc foo  while adGroup loop  var n  0  whileaditer.hasNext    n   aditer.next   ifn lt 4  var c  Campaign   ag.getCampaign    AdGroup   ag.getName    Ads   n  test.pushc or test[test.length]  Campaign   ag.getCampaign    AdGroup   ag.getName    Ads   n   back in the adGroup loop Logger.logtest  end of function  codepre  pAlso in this case, the log only contained either an code[]code or the actual correct output per row if the condition was fulfilled, but it never truly appended the values to codetestcode, it rather replaced them, with the very final output being simply an empty array. It may be a very small detail Im overlooking here and I sat on this with several other more experienced people, none of which found a solution.p  pbr strongEDIT 2strong Adapted the code with concatenating all single results into an array. Output returns the correct number of rows equal to the number of accounts, but the array is always empty. p  precodefunction afterProcessAllClientAccountsresults  for var i  0 i lt results.length i  var result  [] var sresult  results[i].getReturnValue result.concatsresult Logger.logresult    codepre

Negative 2857 pThe long version I am writing an app for iOS 8 in Swift, and its main functionality requires it to display a slideshow of sorts of pictures and videos. Considering that, to my knowledge, an AVPlayer cannot display pictures Ive tried feeding it an image URL in the same way Ive fed it a video URL, and no luck, this requires me to add and remove a UIImageView or an AVPlayer from the view in order to display the appropriate content. However, in order to show the content correctly, I have to hide the apps navigation bar by default. The idea is to show it again if the user taps on the view. The view has a Tap Gesture Recognizer that serves this purpose. These tap gestures work correctly, assuming the views content is the image view. However, if the view presently contains the AVPlayer, the gestures are not received, rendering me unable to allow the user to show the navigation bar and leave the view. Here is how the AVPlayer is added to the viewp  precodeif Utilities.IsVideourl              var escapedUrl  url.stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding             let player  AVPlayerURL NSURLstring escapedUrl             var cont  AVPlayerViewController             cont.player  player             self.addChildViewControllercont             self.view.addSubviewcont.view             cont.view.frame  self.view.frame             player.play          codepre  pThe short version I have a view in an iOS app that contains a Tap Gesture Recognizer. The taps do not pass through an AVPlayer that is added to the view. How do I detect these tapsp  pIt is worthy of mention that if the user taps on one of the media emcontrolsem such as the play button, the tap gesture is then recognized and its action triggered.p

I was able to get an example code from twoseven.co.nz, courtesy Dan which matched my requirement but I think I am doing something wrong.p  pI am able to get output correctly till question122,p  pThough It doesnt go ahead and doesnt show output for step3 option21p  pI have added the code, it would be great if someone could point me in the right direction.
