Positive 2193 pSorry if this question may be very basic or even stupid but I am not very skilled in mySQL. However, I need to create a database for my master thesis so I want to be sure it is the most elegant and correct as possible.p  pI have a dataset with a number of Merger and Acquisition deals with relative information dealid  12 columns. I need to add information about the industry of the deal. However, this information comes from 3 different databases that apply to subsets of the MampA some deals have one classification, some another and some another. p  pFor all I know I have two options integrate all in the deal table or splitting it in 4 tables one for the deals and one for each different classification with 11 relations. In the first case I would have a table with more than 50 columns, but the second approach does not look very nice.p  pDoes it one of these approaches make sense Or is there another way I dont knowp  pEDIT right now I have 4 excel tables that I would like to import into mySQL. The main table is the deal table it has the primary key dealid and then other columns like parentname, targetname, etc. So far, I then have 3 more tables, one for each classification. The primary key is again dealid, but then every table has specific columns about 15 since every classification has different features such as NACE code, NACE code description, industry sector, SIC code etc.. p  pThanks in advance.p

Positive 2193 pIm working with a dataframe, one column of which contains values that are mostly numeric but may contain nonnumeric entries.  I would like to split this column into multiple columns. One of the new columns should contain the numeric portion of the original entry and another column should contain any nonnumeric elements.p  pHere is a sample data framep  precodedf lt data.frameID14,xclt 0.1,100,A 2.5, 200  codepre  pHere is what I would like the data frame to look likep  precodeID   x1   x2 1    lt    0.1 2         100 3    A    2.5 4         200 codepre  pOn feature of the data I am currently taking advantage of is that the structure of the character strings is always as follows the nonnumeric elements if they exist always precede the numeric elements and the two elements are always separated with a space.  p  pI can use colsplit from the reshape package to split the column based on whitespace.

To add another wrinkle, the extra hyphen is not always in the same spot, depending on the category it could be the first hyphen in the client name or second hyphen in the site that needs to be ignored, fortunately, this is consistent by category if category  animals.p  pFor category animals if there are two hyphens I need to ignore the first.p  pFor category fruit if there are two hyphens I need to ignore the second.p  pAny ideasp  pExample asset lists category  animals if there is two hyphens, I need to split at the second. assetList fishmark, catjim, bluedoghenry, redbirdbill, greensnakelarryp  pcategory  fruit if there is two hyphens, I need to split at the first. assetList  limehenry, lemonsusan, bananabobnelson, applerickjones, pineapplesamsmithp  pBelow is my codep  precodevar assetList  fishmark, catjim, bluedoghenry, redbirdbill, greensnakelarry  var count  assetList.matchg  [].lengthcounts the hyphens clientsiteId combo  var splitObj   var comboObj   var clientObj   var siteObj   var mainSplitObj   var allClient   var allSite    mainSplitObj  assetList.split,       for var i  0 i lt count i           splitObj[spliti]  mainSplitObj[0i] puts the clientsiteID into a substring             comboObj[comboi]  splitObj[spliti].split splits the clientsiteID at the dash                 clientObj[clienti]  comboObj[comboi][0] puts the client name in a substring                 siteObj[sitei]  comboObj[comboi][1] puts the siteid in a substring                      allClient  clientObj[clienti]    cumulatively adds client substrings to allClient variable                     allSite  siteObj[sitei]     cumulatively adds site substrings to allSite variable                tempC  allClient.split,         uniqueClient  []             for var i  0 i lt tempC.length i                  isIn  0                 for var j  0 j lt uniqueClient.length j                      if tempC[i]  uniqueClient[j]                          isIn  1                                                       if isIn  0                      uniqueClient.pushtempC[i]                                       tempS  allSite.split,         uniqueSite  []             for var i  0 i lt tempS.length i                  isIn  0                 for var j  0 j lt uniqueSite.length j                      if tempS[i]  uniqueSite[j]                          isIn  1                                                       if isIn  0                      uniqueSite.pushtempS[i]                               codepre

Negative 2193 pI was wondering if anyone knows of a reliable Delta RGB formula or code snippet that does colour Delta of the full RGB tri stim values, like how DeltaE 2000cmc does LabLch that takes emperceptualem differences into account.

C preferred, but I can convert from any language.p  pI currently have a very basic rgb delta formula, but I would like to implement something that gets a truer sense of perceptual colour difference. Current right now is p  pfloat delta  Math.SqrtMath.Powr1r2, 2  Math.Powg1g2, 2  Math.Powb1b2, 2p  pThis is similar to DeltaE 76lab but has the same drawbacks where perceptual difference is not taken into account.p  pPLEASE dont just do a google search and paste the first thing you see There are lots of Delta RGB formulas out there that may be found but do not take perceptual differences into account. If you have knowledge of this, please comment andor paste any links to code samples. Also, I already have conversion from RGB to LabLch and then into De2000cmc. I am not looking for that.p  pThanks in advancep

Thanksp  pI am looking for a byte array 4 time longer than the float array the dimension of the byte array will be 4 times that of the float array, since each float is composed of 4 bytes.  Ill pass this to a BinaryWriter.p  pstrongEDITstrong To those critics screaming premature optimization I have benchmarked this using ANTS profiler before I optimized. There was a significant speed increase because the file has a writethrough cache and the float array is exactly sized to match the sector size on the disk. The binary writer wraps a file handle created with codepinvokecoded win32 API.  The optimization occurs since this lessens the number of function calls.p  pAnd, with regard to memory, this application creates massive caches which use plenty of memory.  I can allocate the byte buffer once and reuse it many timesthe double memory usage in this particular instance amounts to a roundoff error in the overall memory consumption of the app.p  pSo I guess the lesson here is not to make premature assumptions p

Negative 2193 pOk I have done enough research on it but cant find the solution. Its from one page of a application to another page of application. Since I would be sending in username and password i cant send it as getT so i need to do a post. I will be using ssl though  not sure if that helps.. so i cant use sessions as its on different apps and using those shared sessions like databsae is performance killing Also once the user clicks the link on the source page, i need to do some post processing and then want to post to the other page so using the form and stuff wont work..p  pany helpp  pfyi What I am trying to achieve is that a person when logs in app A, they click some link, i dont some processing and want to transfer them to app B where they dont have to relogin in app B but instead automatically get logged in..p
Negative 2193 pI am using IIS 6.0 and have a virtual directory setup. The server is setup on my companys intranet. Under the security settings, anonymous access is disabled, integrated windows authentication is enabled, digest authentication for windows domain servers is enabled, and the realm has our AD domain address.p  pEverything works fine with this authentication when the the site is accessed with the URL including the machine name like, httpmyServerNamemyWebSite. However, when we use this format, httpmyIPAddressmyWebSite, a security box pops up. If credentials are entered in this box, everything works properly. Why is this popping up when the IP Address is used in the URL in place of the machine namep  pThe reason we need to use the IP Address in the URL is that the URL with the server name is not recognized in all of our locations.p

Negative 2193 pIm trying to get a sense of how to implement the userrole relationships for an application Im writing.  The persistence layer is Google App Engines datastore, which places some interesting but generally beneficial constraints on what can be done.  Any thoughts are appreciated.p  pIt might be helpful to keep things very concrete. I would like there to be organizations, users, test content and test administrations records of tests that have been taken.  A user can have the role of participant testtaker, contributor of test material or both.  A user can also be a member of zero or more organizations.  In the role of participant, the user can see the previous administrations of tests he or she has taken.  The user can also see a test administration of another participant if that participant has given the user authorization.  The user can see test material that has been made public, and he or she can see restricted content as a participant during a specific administration of a test for which that user has been authorized by an organization. As a member of an organization, the user can see restricted content in the role of contributor, and he or she might or might not also be able to edit the content.  Each organization should have one or more administrators that can determine whether a member can see and edit content and determine who has admin privileges.  There should also be one or more applicationwide superusers that can troubleshoot and solve problems.  Members of organizations can see the administrations of tests that the participants concerned have authorized them to see, and they can see anonymous data if no authorization has been given.  A user cannot see the test results of another user in any other circumstances.p  pSince there are no joins in the App Engine datastore, it might be necessary to have things less normalized than usual for the typical SQL database in order to ensure that queries that check permissions are fast e.g., ones that determine whether a link is to be displayed.p  pMy questions arep  ol liHow do I move forward on this  Should I spend a lot of time up front in order to get the model right, or can I iterate several times and gradually roll in additional complexityli liDoes anyone have some general ideas about how to break things up in this instanceli liAre there any GAE libraries that handle roles in a way that is compatible with this arrangementli ol

Negative 2193 pAm I using SessionEnd incorrectlyp  pIn my application, I have a cache to speed up page loads, it works quite well. Recently, someone suggested to me that I was leaking memory by never emptying it out, and to implement a method on SessionEnd that will clear out any cache entries associated with that session id.p  pOccasionally though I started seeing anomalous behaviour. When loading a page, very rarely I would see an empty page, showing an exception due the the cache for that page being empty. I put a debugger breakpoint in the cache access and the sessionend methods, hoping to catch it the next time it ocurred.p  pThe next time it happened I was quite surprised at what was actually happening. My browser was left open but idle for a long time, so Im guessing it had a stale session cookie. It hits the server for the page, which puts a copy of the page into the cache. While the page is still loading, SessionEnd is called instantly, which deletes it out of the cache. If I reload the browser, SessionEnd keeps getting called, agressively trying to close my session that the poor browser keeps requesting.p  pSo I suppose my real questions arep  ul liWhy isnt the browser getting a new session cookie if the old one is that anathemic to IISli liIs SessionEnd simply not designed to be used in this wayli liIs there a better way to do what Im trying to doli ul  pSosh  my global.asax.csp  precode    protected void SessionEndObject sender, EventArgs e      clean up object cache on session expiry string sessionID  this.Session.SessionID  foreach string key in Global.DataGroups.Keys  if key.EndsWithsessionID  Global.DataGroups.Removekey        codepre

Negative 2193 pWhen calling an unmanaged Dll from a c application I get an codeAccessViolationExceptioncode. The strange thing is that the exported function has no arguments, so the problem is not in the Marshalling of data. The function gets no argument and just returns an integer. Also note that calling convention is not an issue. An identical function with the same zero arguments and integer return value but different name works just fine. What are the remaining  candidate reasons that such a call could cause this exception considering the fact that marshalling and calling convention is ruled out p  pUPDATE The dll function is correct because if called from other unmanaged code through plain linking, then it works perfectly. p  pUPDATE 2 Everything is compiled and run on 32 bit. I tried Win XP SP2 and Vista. Here is an interesting fact On Vista Systems it works like a charm. On XP it fails.p  pUPDATE 3 I didnt get the source code but I learned what essentially this dll does, so i tried to reproduce the problem with my own dll. Here is the story The original dll is some kind of a wrapper to ei.lib Erlangs c interface library. It exports some helper funcs. So  to reproduce the problem I have made a wrapper dll around ei.lib which exports only one function, namely test. I did that so I wouldnt mess with marshalling and stuff. I wanted just to test an initialization, connecting and sending a message. So this test func of my dll just calls codeeiconnectinitcode, then codeeiconnectcode and finaly codeeiregsendcode, with arguments hardcoded inside. The problem is that if I call this dll and use the test function from another unmanaged code, it works ok. Message is sent. But when I call it from c through DllImport then it works only on Vista. Not on XP. On XP it fails with a AccessViolationException on the .net layer. I ve tried to trace down the problem and I see that from inside my dll, any call to codeeiconnectcode, or any attempt to read codeerlerrnocode these are defined in ei.lib when running on XP and being called by managed code result in trying to read or write protected memory so the app crashes. It cant be something trivial since it works on Vista and it works when called by unmanaged code.  p

Negative 2193 pI have an ASP.NET MVC web app whose controllers use WCF to call into the domain model on a different server. The domain code needs to talk to a database and access to the database server isnt always possible from web servers depends on the customer site hence the use of WCF to get to a place where my code is allowed to connect to the database server. p  pThis is configurable so if the controllers are able to access the database server directly then I use local instances of the domain objects rather than use WCF.p  pLets say I have a page asking for person details like age, name etc. This is a complex type that is a parameter on my WCF operation like this p  precode[OperationContract] string SayHello Person oPerson codepre  pWhen I generate the client code eg by adding a service reference in my client I get a separate Person class that fulfills the wcf contract. The client, an MVC web app, can use this client Person class as the view model and all is well. I pass that straight into the WCF client methods and it all works brilliantly.p  pIf my mvc client app is configured to NOT use WCF I have a problem. If I am calling my domain objects directly from the controller assume I have a domain access factoryprovider setup then I need the original Person class and not the wcf generated Person class. This results in my problem which is that I will have to perform mapping from one object to another if I dont use WCFp  pThe main problem with this is that there are many domain objects that will need to be mapped and errors may be introduced such as new properties forgotten about in future changesp  pIm learning and experimenting with WCF and MVC can you help me know what my options are in this scenario Im sure there will be an easy way out of this given the extensibility of WCF and MVCp  pThanksp

Negative 2193 pI have a WPF app, where one of the fields has a numeric input box for length of a phone call, called ActivityDuration.p  pPreviously this has been saved as an Integer value that respresents minutes. However, the client now wishes to record meetings using the same table, but meetings can last for 45 hours so entering 240 minutes doesnt seem very user friendly.p  pIm currently considering my options, whether to change ActivityDuration to a time value in SQL 2008 and try to use a time mask input box, or keep it as an integer and present the client with 2 numeric input boxes, one for hours and one for minutes and then do the calculation to save it in SQL Server 2008 as integer minutes.p  pIm open to comments and suggestions. One further consideration is that I will need to be able to calculate total time based upon the ActivityDuration so the field DataType should allow it to be summed easy.p

Negative 2193 pI have a JavaScript function which is quite long and performs a number of tasks, I would like to report progress to the user by updating the contents of a SPAN element with a message as I go.  I tried adding document.getElementByIdspnProgress.innerText  ... statements throughout the function code.p  pHowever, whilst the function is executing the UI will not update and so you only ever see the last message written to the SPAN which is not very helpful.p  pMy current solution is to break the task up into a number of functions, at the end of each I set the SPAN message and then trigger the next one with a window.setTimeout call with a very short delay say 10ms.  This yields control and allows the browser to repaint the SPAN with the updated message before starting the next step.p  pHowever I find this very messy and difficult to follow the code, Im thinking there must be a better way.  Does anyone have any suggestions Is there any way to force the SPAN to repaint without having to leave the context of the functionp  pThanksp
Negative 2193 pIm trying to use the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.io.log.aspx relnofollowSystem.IO.Loga features to build a recoverable transaction system. I understand it to be implemented on top of the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff56536328vVS.8529.aspx relnofollowCommon Log File Systema.p  pThe usual a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAlgorithmsforRecoveryandIsolationExploitingSemantics relnofollowARIESa approach to writeahead logging involves persisting log record sequence numbers in places other than the log for example, in the header of the database page modified by the logged action.p  pInterestingly, the documentation for CLFS says that such a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff541824.aspx relnofollowsequence numbers are always 64bit integersa.p  pConfusingly, however, the .Net wrapper around those a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.io.log.sequencenumber.aspx relnofollowcodeSequenceNumbercodeas can be a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.io.log.sequencenumber.sequencenumber28vVS.9029.aspx relnofollowconstructed from a codebyte[]codea but not from a codeUInt64code. Its value can also be a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.io.log.sequencenumber.getbytes28vVS.9029.aspx relnofollowread as a codebyte[]codea, but not as a codeUInt64code. Inspecting the implementation of codeSequenceNumber.GetBytescode reveals that it can in fact return arrays of either 8 or 16 bytes.p  pThis raises a few questionsp  ol liWhy do the .Net sequence numbers differ in size from the CLFS sequence numbersli liWhy are the .Net sequence numbers variable in lengthli liWhy would you need 128 bits to represent such a sequence number It seems like you would truncate the log well before using up a 64bit address space 16 exbibytes, or around 1019 bytes, more if you address longer wordsli liIf log sequence numbers are going to be represented as 128 bit integers, why not provide a way to serializedeserialize them as pairs of codeUInt64codes instead of ratherpointlessly incurring heap allocations for shortlived new codebyte[]codes every time you need to writeread one Alternatively, why bother making codeSequenceNumbercode a value type at allli ol  pIt seems an odd tradeoff to double the storage overhead of log sequence numbers just so you can have an untruncated log longer than a million terabytes, so I feel like Im missing something here, or maybe several things. Id much appreciate it if someone in the know could set me straight.p  pstrongClarificationstrongp  pI agree with what Damien and Andras are saying. Those concerns are by far the most likely explanation for the byte[] return type. But the current implementation on top of CLFS has, on inspection of the disassembly, code paths where it creates 64bit LSNs and code paths where it creates 128bit LSNs. Why And can a client using System.IO.Log on top of CLFS safely store LSNs in a fixedlength 64bit field 128bit field A field of any fixed lengthp  pIts nextdoor to useless if the LSNs can be of arbitrary length, since you need an LSN field somewhere in the page header to implement physiological recovery. If the field is of variable length, then there is a notinsignificant increase in complexity addressing the nonheader portion of the page. If there is no bound on the variable length, then you cant even be sure that you will have space on the page to expand the LSN header field without spilling either the header or the page contents to a new page, neither of which is viable in the general case since the point where you would detect this condition is far less abstract than the point where you would have information about how to perform such a recovery, if the data structure you are storing even permits something of that kind.p

Negative 2193 pI am currently in the process of designingimplementing a repository pattern in a .NET application. After many days of research I feel I am getting close but there really is so many ideas and opinions out there I was hoping to get some peoples thoughts on any design considerations they may have had if youve implemented one yourself already. So...p  pSo the major design issue Im facing is... Generic Vs Specific Repositories Theres a lot of stuff on this out there and Ive done a lot of thinking on this and am still undecided. I will be implementing a IRepository interface and Repository base class. The decision then is whether to leave the repository implementation like this or make the Repository class an abstract class and extend it via specific repositories so eitherp  precodepublic RepositoryltTgt Repository  IRepositoryltTgt instantiated as RepositoryltCustomergt CustomerRepository  new RepositoryltCustomergt codepre  porp  precodepublic CustomerRepository CustomerRepository  RepositoryltTgt, ICustomerRepository instantiated as CustomerRepository CustomerRepository  new CustomerRepository codepre  pInitially I was definitely for the specific implementation. The amount of code reuse and reduced number of interfaces and classes with a generic repository is a big plus but I deem the contract it defines to be simply too wide. Allowing the data access layer to be queried in virtually any way by outside objects could lead to all kinds of performance and optimization issues how could a DBA know which queries where being run on the DB without combing through the entire code... possibly up to the UI layer. This lead me to specific repositories, which can inherit from the abstract BaseRepository to take advantage of code reuse, while still defining a narrow contract such via methods like GetCustomerByName. p  pA good solution I think but the final design I have come too uses the generic repository pattern along with the the specification pattern. This I really like as it allows the queries on the entities to be encapsulated in classes. Very elegant an ensuring the queries are managed as opposed to a freeforall sale A couple of caveats though... p  p1 Does the use of specifications limit the freedom to move to another data source Specification pattern seems quite easy to leverage into a repository if the data source supports LINQ. So our repository method would be something likep  precodeIEnumerableltTgt QueryISpecificationltTgt specification codepre  pBut what if we wanted to created a repository using an older ADO.Net 2.0 provider. Wouldnt the queries now have to somehow be converted to an SQL query in the repository Or the entire table of Customers would need to be read into memory so each individual customer would need to be checked before the matches could be returned to the aggregate. This will be an issue for us... We have a client running a MySQL database that supports .NET 4.0 but also another client with a dated DB2 database which only has a .NET 2.0 provider.p  p2 and what about in cases where the CRUD tasks on each entity may not be standard. ie. Maybe a customer cant be deleted... Maybe  the creation of some other entity doesnt follow the normal creation pattern of other entities How would this be handled with a generic repository. I do really like the streamlined design of a generic repository with the specification pattern, but Ill be back to specific repositories if this couldnt be supported. Sorry that was so long winded... but it would be great to hear peoples ideas on thisp  pI would also like to implement Unit Of Work and DI but I want to finalise my repository design before moving ahead.p

Negative 2193 pI have a control that ive written that has a javascript component and a web service component.  The problem im having is that the javascript is set to dop  precodesetIntervalthis.checkAlertsHandler, this.messageCheckInterval  1000 codepre  pThis calls a function which makes a webservice call like sop  precodeAlert.SiteAlertService.GetAlertsthis.receivedAlertsHandler, this.errorReceivedAlertsHandler codepre  pSo this is using the web service javascript proxy methods to access the web service.  The issue is that our application has forms authentication and a timeout value, so if the user is idle for too long it will log them out.p  pMy webservice call apparently sends the cookie which includes the session and the forms authentication key to the web service.  The asp.net webservice then automatically renews the session AND the forms authentication. Everytime the javascript hits the web service it basically keeps the user alive.  I do not want this behavior, this should just circumvent that, so that even though this js is hitting the web service to check for new messages, if the user hasnt done a postback on our application and is effectively idle it will still log them out.  This isnt happening p  pWhat i would like to happen is this interval call to the web service does not renew any authentication the session renewal i can get around by using an application level variable with dictionary keyvalue for the users session id, so i dont have to use any session level variables.  p  pHow do i do this  change my web service  or control to work like the way i want it  p

Negative 2193 pcodestdautoptrcode is not allowed to be stored in an STL container, such as codestdvectorcode.

Negative 2193 pI am developing a masterslave style application.  The master application will send state data to the slaves to process and display at some constant rate.  The state data is wrapped up into a single class that contains many fields.  These field types consist of primitives, classes, interfaces, lists of interfaces, and so on.  All the types are either BCL or custom types, so the the custom types can be modified if necessary.  Both the master and and slave applications will be .NET 4.0.  I am not concerned with serialization versioning as the master and slave applications will be delivered as a pair.p  pI need a quick way to serialize the state data on the master and deserialize it on the slaves.  When I say quick, I am more talking about development time but processing time could be a factor if the solution was terrible.  However, the master and slaves will be distributed over a WAN, so some level of compactness would be nice also.p  pFor a quick solution, I am currently thinking about simply using codeBinaryFormattercode and then compressing the stream with codeGZipStreamcode.  Is this the way to go for .NET 4.0p

But thats where Im stuck  It seems like Im picking away at this when it shouldnt be there in the first place.  strongIs there any way to remove the whole thing from the DOM at once with jQuery, or better yet, any way to prevent my page from being highjacked in the first place  After this, never again will I use GoDaddy hostingstrongp  pThis is what the page source looks like after pulling it up in a browser.p  precode    ltbodygt     lt MY HTML HERE gt         lt GoDaddy Preview DNS crap injected below gt      ltbody classyuiskinsamgt     lt Begin PDNS div gt     ltdiv iddivContextHelp stylevisibility hiddengt         ltdiv classpdnscontexthelpcontent idctl00ContentPlaceHolder1hlpWebsitePreviewHelpdpContextHelpgt                 ltdiv classpdnsWizardHeadergt                         ltdiv stylefloat left paddingtop 5pxgt                                                         Preview DNS                         ltdivgt                         ltdiv stylefloat right paddingtop 5px paddingright 5pxgt                                 ltimg aligntop styleborderwidth 0px cursor pointer srchttpshostingmanager.secureserver.netAppThemesResellerImagesiconclose.gif idctl00ContentPlaceHolder1hlpWebsitePreviewHelpimgClose gt                         ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv alignleft classpdnsWizardLabelgt                         ltspan classContextHelpTitle idctl00ContentPlaceHolder1hlpWebsitePreviewHelplblTitlegtWelcomeltspangt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv alignleft stylewhitespace normal classpdnsWizardValuegt                         ltspan idctl00ContentPlaceHolder1hlpWebsitePreviewHelplblDescriptiongt This is a preview of your new Web site.

Negative 2193 pSo let us say I have some chain of classes where each class is derived from the class before it.  For whatever reason, they all like to use the same name for some member function.  Kinda like thisp  precodeclass C1  public             void f  coutltltC1   class C2  public C1  public void f  coutltltC2   class C3  public C2  public void f  coutltltC3   codepre  pObviously, if I just declare some objects, then call the function f from them, all will call the function associated with their respective objecttypep  precodeC1 c1 c1.f  prints C1 C2 c2 c2.f  prints C2 C3 c3 c3.f  prints C3 codepre  pNow, if I declare some pointerstoobjects, then call the function f from them, all will call the function associated with their respective pointertypep  precodeC1 p1  ampc1 p1gtf  prints C1 C1 p2  ampc2 p2gtf  prints C1 C1 p3  ampc3 p3gtf  prints C1 C2 p4  ampc2 p4gtf  prints C2 C2 p5  ampc3 p5gtf  prints C2 C3 p6  ampc3 p6gtf  prints C3 codepre  pAll of this is super.  I either call the function associated with the objects type or I call the function associated with the pointers type...p  pOr of course I could make the function virtual.  Then if I call the function from some object, I will get no change in behavior however, if I call the function from some pointer, then I wont just call the function for the pointers type, I will actually call the function for the objecttype that the pointer is pointing to.  So far so good.p  pI can even make the change to virtual midway through the chain of inheritance.  Lets say I put a virtual before the function f inside of class C2.  Now the function has been made virtual i.e. when called from pointers, it uses the objectpointedtotype instead of the pointertype to resolve the function call, not only for its own class, but for all future classes that are derived from it.p  pMy question is this  Once a function has been declared virtual at some point in the chain of inheritance can it ever be reverted back to being nonvirtual further down the chain of inheritancep  pFor clarification  When I say revert back to nonvirtual behavior, I mean that when I call the function from a pointer, it will use the pointers type to resolve the function call and not the objecttype that the pointer is pointing to.p

Negative 2193 pSuppose I have two projects. One is an application and the other is a shared library that contains common, reusable code that could be used by more than just this application.p  pMy application uses STL, and my shared library also uses STL. The first problem here is that my shared library is using STL. If I ever build a newer version of STL into my application but I do not rebuild my shared library because it is not necessary, then we will have compatibility issues right away.p  pMy first thought to solve this issue is to not use STL at all in the interface to the shared library classes. Suppose we have a function in my library that takes a string and does something with it. I would make the function prototype look likep  precodevoid DoStuffWithStrings char const str  codepre  pinstead ofp  precodevoid DoStuffWithStrings stdstring constamp str  codepre  pFor strings this will probably be OK between different versions of STL, but the downside is that we are going from codestdstringcode, to codecharcode, and back to codestdstringcode, which seems like it causes performance issues.p  pIs the boxingunboxing of raw types to their STL counterparts recommended This becomes even worse when we try to do this to a codestdlistcode, since there really is no raw type I am aware of that we could easily pass it as without doing some sort of On or similar operation.p  pWhat designs work best in this scenario What are the proscons of eachp

Negative 2193 pIm working on a mobile website which is growing in popularity and this is leading to growth in some key database tables  and were starting to see some performance issues when accessing those tables. Not being database experts nor having the money to hire any at this stage were struggling to understand what is causing the performance problems. Our tables are not emthatem big so SQL Server should be able to handle them fine and weve done everything we know to do in terms of optimising our queries. So heres the pseudo table structurep  precode[user] approx. 40,000 rows, 37 cols  id               INT pk contentgroupid INT fk [username]       VARCHAR20 ...  [contentgroup] approx. 200,000 rows, 5 cols  id    INT pk title VARCHAR20 ...  [content] approx. 1,000,000 rows, 12 cols  id                  INT pk contentgroupid    INT fk contenttypeid     INT fk contentsubtypeid INT fk ...  [contenttype] 2 rows, 3 cols  id INT pk ...  [contentsubtype] 8 rows, 3 cols id              INT pk contenttypeid INT fk ... codepre  pWere expecting those row counts to grow considerably in particular the user, contentgroup, and content tables. Yes the user table has quite a few columns  and weve identified some which can be moved into other tables. There are also a bunch of indexes weve applied to the affected tables which have helped.p  pThe big performance problems are the stored procedures were using to search for users which include joins to the content table on the contentgroupid field. We have tried to modify the codeWHEREcode and codeANDcode clauses using various different approaches and we think we have got them as good as we can but still its too slow.p  pOne other thing we tried which hasnt helped was to put an indexed view over the user and content tables. There was no noticeable performance gain when we did this so weve abandoned that idea due to the extra level of complexity inherent in having a view layer.p  pSo, what are our options We can think of a few but all come with pros and consp  pstrongDenormalise of the Table Structurestrongp  pAdd multiple direct foreign key constraints between the user and content tables  so there would be a different foreign key to the content table for each content sub type. p  pPros p  ul liJoining the content table will be more optimal by using its primary key.li ul  pConsp  ul liThere will be a lot of changes to our existing stored procedures and website code.li liMaintaining up to 8 additional foreign keys more realistically well only use 2 of these will not be anywhere near as easy as the current single key.li ul  pstrongMore Denormalisation of the Table Structurestrongp  pJust duplicate the fields we need from the content table into the user table directly. p  pProsp  ul liNo more joins for to the content table  which significantly reduces the work SQL has to do.li ul  pConsp  ul liSame as above extra fields to maintain in the user table, changes to SQL and website code.li ul  pstrongCreate a MidTier Indexing Layerstrongp  pUsing something like Lucene.NET, wed put an indexing layer above the database. This would in theory improve performance of all search and at the same time decrease the load on the server.p  pProsp  ul liThis is a good longterm solution. Lucene exists to improve search engine performance.li ul  pConsp  ul liThere will be a much larger development cost in the short term  and we need to solve this problem ASAP.li ul  pSo those are the things weve come up with and at this stage were thinking the second option is the best  Im aware that denormalising has its issues however sometimes its best to sacrifice architectural purity in order to get performance gains so were prepared to pay that cost.p  pAre there any other approaches which might work for us Are there any additional pros andor cons with the approaches Ive outlined above which may influence our decisionsp
Negative 2193 pI have some integration tests that test the processing of USB data from a USB listener that is part of our application. I want to be able to run these test even when the device the code is listening too isnt present. i.e have my test code write to a device so my production code reads it and processes it. The device being present wont effect the processing of the production code. Does anyone know if this is possiblep  pThanksp  pEDIT The reason that Im trying this method is that the similar code works very well for the RS232 version, i.e the integration tests write to the port and the presence of a device plugged in doesnt effect the outcome. p

Negative 2193 pSo I have the Smarty TM bundle installed and active in Textmate, but I have a problem with the way it treats stuff inside of Smartys codeliteralcode tags.p  pAs seen in this example a hrefhttppastie.textmate.orgprivatev3amipi5ukpg7vlcivixw relnofollowhttppastie.textmate.orgprivatev3amipi5ukpg7vlcivixwap  pIf I put Smarty codeliteralcode tags inside of my HTML codescriptcode tags, TM sees the stuff within the script tags as JS and highlights it appropriately. If I move those codeliteralcode tags such that they are around my script, Textmate loses track of the fact that the codescriptcode tags contain javascriptor even that the codescriptcode tags emareem HTMLneither are highlighted.p  pI hate putting my literal tags inside the script because everything that deals with JS in the editor for example, I have a TM command to run my JS through JSHint gets mad at them being there unless I prefix them with JS comments like in my pasted example. But prefixing them with comments is extra work I dont feel like doing, and causes lots of empty comments in my outputted source.p  pI have looked at the various lang definitions involved, and just cannot figure out what the heck to do to fix it.

Negative 2193 pHow can I implement a busy spin mechanism of the formp  precodewhilevariable  0 codepre  pwhere variable is updated to 1 by some other CUDA thread after some event has occured.p  pI tried to just write it like above but the code just seems to get ignored and the calling thread just runs past it without waiting at all. Im absolutely sure that the value is 0, but the thread does not wait at all. Also, if I writep  precodewhilevariable  0 threadfence codepre  pin order to not risk having the variable cached, the thread blocks indefinitely even thought the variable gets set to 1 eventually. This is all very strange behavior to me, since replicating this code on the CPU produces the correct behavior.p  pEdit Oddly, this seems to work correctly if I have blocks of 1 thread each, but not if I have several threads within one block. So threads from one block can see writes done by threads from other blocks, but not writes done by threads from the same block. Strange...p

Negative 2193 pIve got two different CSVs. One is a report of global groups, local groups and systems. The other is a list of users, logon IDs, and global groups.p  pAs you can see, Global AD Groups is the common column and is labeled Members in both files. Some of the items in Members are actually either local users or domain users. Local users need to be filtered out and domain users need to be ported to the results.p  pWhat makes this task difficult is that the join is a many to many. Also, I need to be able to easily add new columns to the script. I already know how to take the output of whatever script you create and reorder the columns as needed.p  pIdeally, it shouldnt matter what columns are in each CSV file and the script should join all columns from both files together based on the common column. Although, it would be nice if the common column could be specified when the function is called.p  pSo sample data would look likep  precodeCSV1 Members,LocalGroup,System System1localuser,Guests,System1 adminaccounts,Administrators,System2 adminaccounts,Auditors,System2 System3User1,Administrators,System3 System3Temp,Guests,System3 System4Temp,Guests,System4 System5Temp,Guests,System5 Domain1ngd,Users,System6 Domain1Group1,Administrators,System7 Domain1Group1,Administrators,System8 Domain1Group1,Administrators,System9 Domain1Group1,Administrators,System10 Domain1Group2,Administrators,System1 Domain1Group2,Administrators,System4 Domain1Group2,Administrators,System7 Domain1Group3,Administrators,System3 Domain1Group3,Administrators,System1 Domain1Group4,Administrators,System4 Domain2Group1,Administrators,System5 Domain2Group1,Administrators,System6 Domain2Group1,Administrators,System2  CSV2 Members,Username,Logon ID Domain1Group1,Pauline S.

Negative 2193 pSometimes I have come across this issue that whenever I change the order of members, order of derivation in my C class the issue gets solved, crash gets fixed.p  pRecently I moved the position of a private member variable from a lower location to the top of my class and the error got fixedp  pAnother time I had a class Apublic B, public C. The moment I changed this to  class Apublic C, public B the crashing code started working. C is class containing virtual methods and in the former case class A was not finding the method overriden in C but in the later it was able to find. Is this due to virtual pointer corruption If so what has it got to do with order of members I know the memory layout changes when we change order of members but how do we debug such sort of issues because in VS2008 I could not find any indication as to why the crash was happeningp  pNote Base classes B and C are totally independent and have no dependency on each otherp
Negative 2193 pI am carrying around the idea to create a restricted form of a language for tabular analysis. Thequestion is if there is something like the following already around or if there are better ideas todo it. The key requirement is that the user must be able to employ naked script files without thenecessity to produce a full Python program. OTOH elements of the script language are compiled at runtime andshould offer a possibility to formulate complex conditions and calculations mostly arithmetic and string operations. The declarative way to formulate programs in the language see below prohibits the direct use of Python syntax as the vehicle for the language see the implications of the PART function  at least I think so. Is there a better more clever more elegant way to achieve my goals than to program around in a semiparsed mixture of Python and clumsy selfdefined syntax like I did belowp  pBelow I try to make my ideas clear by an example. The input table is produced by another program part and looks like this on start of the script interpretationp  precode First,Last,Department,Hourly Wage [ Greg,Foo,HR,100,   Judy,Bar,EE,51,   Jake,Baz,HR,75,   Lila,Bax,HR,49,   Norm,Fob,EE,49 ] codepre  pFollowing is the script file itself. This will be a file for itself in a production system. The program code is currently laid down as an array of Python strings  maybe not even that in a final version.p  precode A program to produce per department the average hourly rate, separated for the higher and lower 50 of earners  [ SORT2,3,       SETmax,MAX3,      PART22 or 3ltmax2,         SETdep,FIRST2,         PRINTdep,floatSUM3CNT3 ] codepre  pI will try to explain step by step what the script shall dop  precodeSORT2,3  codepre  psorts the table after column 2 ascending, then column 3 descending. We getp  precode[ Judy,Bar,EE,51,   Norm,Fob,EE,49,   Greg,Foo,HR,100,   Jake,Baz,HR,75,   Lila,Bax,HR,49, ]  SETmax,MAX3  codepre  ptakes the maximum of column 3 and puts it into a dynamic, local variable maxp  precodePART22 or 3ltmax2  codepre  pis a bit more complex. PART partitions the current table into several subtables by evaluating the given expression for each row and cutting in front of the row if true. Here we want to cut at departmentborders column 2. 2 is an upward reference, meaning the element in column 2 from the previous row. This syntax is necessary as I deem the ability to partition tables on conditions more complex than row differs from previous row in X very important imagine you want to partition the table in 10kincome classes so I need the expressive power of a restricted Python expression in the argument to PART. Also this has the implication that the expression can not be evaluated for the first row as there is no predecessor, so the PARTfunction will simply go over it. After this function we have the following tablesp  precode[ Judy,Bar,EE,51 ]  Department EE  [ Norm,Fob,EE,49 ]  Norm Fob is in the same department but earns less than half of the maximum  [ Greg,Foo,HR,100,  New department HR   Jake,Baz,HR,75 ]  [ Lila,Bax,HR,49 ]  HR dept. but less than half of the best earner codepre  pFrom here on, the functions in the script will work on each subtable separately. A PART function more or less starts a loop over all resulting subtables and every following function including more PARTs is executed on a subtable in isolation.p  precodeSETdep,FIRST2, PRINTdep,floatSUM3CNT3 codepre  pFIRST2 takes the value of column 2 of the first row simply. SUM3 takes the sum of the whole column 3 and CNT3 is counting the number of rows which have column 3 unequal to None. I picture the functions outcome roughly herep  precode[ Judy,Bar,EE,51 ]         SETdep,FIRST2  gt dep  EE         PRINTdep,floatSUM3CNT3  gt output  EE 51  [ Norm,Fob,EE,49 ]         SETdep,FIRST2, gt dep  EE         PRINTdep,floatSUM3CNT3  gt output  EE 49  [ Greg,Foo,HR,100,    Jake,Baz,HR,75 ]         SETdep,FIRST2, gt dep  HR         PRINTdep,floatSUM3CNT3  gt output  HR 87.5  [ Lila,Bax,HR,49 ]          SETdep,FIRST2, gt dep  HR         PRINTdep,floatSUM3CNT3  gt output  HR 49 codepre  pI should add that Id prefer to keep the solution small, i.e. no use of nonstandard Python packages like pyparsing etc.p

Negative 2193 pWhat is the recommended way for adding postconditions to async methods which return codeTaskltTgtcodep  pI have read the following suggestionp  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumshuHUasyncthread52fc521c473e4bb2a6666c97a4dd3a39httpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumshuHUasyncthread52fc521c473e4bb2a6666c97a4dd3a39ap  pThe post suggests implementing each method as synchronous, contracting it, and then implementing an async counterpart as a simple wrapper. Unfortunately I dont see this as a workable solution perhaps through my own misunderstandingp  ol liThe async method, although assumed to be a wrapper for the sync method, is left without any real code contract and can therefore do as it wishes.li liCodebases which are committed to asynchrony are unlikely to implement sync counterparts for everything. As a result, implementing new methods which contain codeawaitcodes on other async methods are consequently forced to be async. These methods are intrinsically asynchronous and cannot easily be converted to synchronous. They are not simply wrappers.li ol  pEven if we invalidated the latter point by saying we could use code.Resultcode or code.Waitcode instead of codeawaitcode which would actually cause some codeSyncContextcodes to deadlock, and would have to be rewritten in the async method anyway, Im still convinced about the first point.p  pAre there any alternative ideas, or is there anything that Ive missed about codecontracts and TPLp

Negative 2193 pIm working on a Flash game that must be FlashPlayer 10 compatible no stage3D therefore. There are several movieclips that are transformed in 3D and they also contain child movieclips which may have different 3D transformations applied to them. now, some of the innter movieclips shall contain prerendered animations. Right now i imported them as embedded videos. however, this causes the performance to drop significantly, making the game unplayable.p  pCan anyone give me performance optimization tips on how to have animations playing on 3D transformed layersp  pThanksp  pedit answer to first commentp  pthe stage contains one child representing the 3D scene this movieClip is moved in Z direction to make the camera move through the scene. this sceneClip contains one big clip rotated 90 degree arround X 3D to represent the floor as well as aproximately 20 clips facing the camera and lying on different Z depths. Each of these 20 child clips contains 18 animated children. An animated child clip consists of a prerendered animation of aproximately 20 frames in resolution 150x150. In total there are about 2030 such animated clips.p  pi know that flash caches some movieClips together with their children as bitmaps when the clip is 3D transformed. maybe updating these caches when the animations play is causing the performance drop. maybe restructuring the nesting could solve the problemp

Negative 2193 pI have a servlet that, passed on query params, gets a list of objects from the DAO, turns the list into JSON, and sends it back in the response. Every list is made of objects that have a methodp  precodepublic String getAsJson... codepre  pAnd the servlet has a bunch of mostly indentical methods that look likep  precodeprivate String getUserListAsJson      ListltUsergt userList  this.dao.getUsers     StringBuilder builder  new StringBuilder     builder.append[      loops over the list appending the value of each objects getAsJson     builder.append]     return builder.toString  codepre  pThe problem is that I have about 6 methods and growing that look exactly like that except for different DAO queries. My idea was to create an interface that only had the definition for the getAsJson method, make each bean implement that, and then have another method in the servlet that took objects that implemented that interface. Ended up looking like thisp  precodepublic Interface JsonEnabled      public String getAsJson   public class User implements JsonEnabled      ....     Override     public String getAsJson ...   public class TheServlet      ...     private String getUserListAsJson          ListltUsergt userList  this.dao.getUsers         return this.getListAsJsonuserList          private String getListAsJsonListlt implements JsonEnabledgt list           The loop code that is in each method.       codepre  pSo if anyone has actually read this far P, that doesnt compile and after looking up some documentation from Oracle, you can only have strongextendsstrong and not strongimplementsstrong for generic parameters.  Making all the classes extend from an Abstract Class that just has the getAsJson method doesnt make sense semantically the classes are unrelated.p  pI havent found a good solution on SO or just googling around, so any helpinsight would be appreciated.p
Negative 2193 pI want to know when a Google Maps zoomchanged event is fired specifically by a user interaction with the  zoom buttons.  If I use a general event listener for zoomchanged, I cant tell if it is a usergenerated event or a zoom change caused by something like fitBounds.  Looking for the best way to do this.  p  pIve tried the following things, none of which seem to workp  p1 Looked for event information on zoomchanged.  There appears to be none.p  p2 Add listeners for mouseover and mouseout that let me set a flag to see if the user is in the map bounds, and check the flag on zoomchanged.  This doesnt work because the map does not consider the zoom buttons as part of the map frame in other words, hovering over zoom buttons triggers the mouseout event.p  p3 Add a normal nongMap listener to the zoom buttons.  However, I cant find a definitive CSS selector that will allow me to grab just the buttons.p  p4 Looked for a function in the gMaps API that would let me do something like getZoomElements, and then I could set listeners using that. p  pThe weird thing is I can clearly do what I want if I add a custom control to the map.  It seems very odd that they would force me to do that instead of having a hook into the default zoom controls.p

Negative 2193 pI am at the earliest stage of writing a desktop application for use by multiple users.  I am looking for advice on what is the best way to approach this.p  h1The Spech1  pI will persist my Model in a file which would often be used on a mapped network drive.  It is for the design of roadways and other linear features like railways and streams.p  pThe various end users need to be able to connect to and edit the file simultaneously.  For example, Billy Bob is working on the road named US321 while Rupert is working on I40.  The models for each road live in the same file.  End users can claim any road name, in which only the claimant can edit the given road.  Rupert cant edit US321 while Billy Bob has it claimed, but Rupert can read US321 for reference.  Once a user is finished editing the road data, he can release the claim and someone else could edit it.p  h1Limitations on Serializationh1  pMy understanding of Serialization is quite limited see my profile.  But it looks to me like there is a onetoone correlation between objects and serialization files.  So if I use serialization to implement this, it would not be possible to claim just a part of it nor would it be possible to update only a part of it.  Is this correct  If not, then I can use Serialization, rightp  h1The Solution I am Consideringh1  pI am considering using SQL Server Express, and I am interested in the communitys warnings, corrections, or affirmations on this.  p  pThe end users would not have to know that I am using SQL Server Express in the background.  I would even change the file extension to something suitable to my app.  I would load roads into a list, and each road would be claimable.  Claiming a road would mark it in the database for the other instances of the app to react to accordingly, kind of like it is a shared MS Excel file that multiple people can edit simultaneously, but in the analogy to Excel being able to lock individual worksheets.p  p[Edit]  See Micah Armantrouts very informative response, below.  So now I am wondering about using Microsoft Access as the intermediating db app. p  p[Edit]p  h1Conclusionh1  pThanks to everyone for their helpful answers and comments.  Micahs answer was very helpful since I did not realize I would be limited to the file being controled by only one server.  Although it makes perfect sense now, I had not anticipated it, and if I had gone that route, I would have run aground on it after many hours of working in that direction.p  pWhen I first read urbadaves idea, I dismissed it as something I had already considered and not liked.  But after thinking it over, it is clearly the simplest approach.  I just use a directory like it is a file, but with usertransparency to my my top level subobjects.  But there clearly is an appeal to having my whole model be encapsualted into a single file.p  pSo this is what I have decided to do  Start with just writing to a directory, just as urbadave suggests.  Then later test out putting it in a zip directory and using the ZipPackage class to pluck out and insert the individual serialized files or XML files  another decision I have to make some day.p  ul liPaulli ul

Negative 2193 pI have a mysql table of IPA pronunciation syllables, and Id like to have case sensitivity on a unique key, a varchar containing lots of characters with accent marks.

Negative 2193 pIm in the middle of attempting to replace a Solr setup with Elasticsearch. This is a new setup, which has not yet seen production, so I have lots of room to fiddle with things and get them working well.p  pI have very, very large amounts of data. Im indexing some live data and holding onto it for 7 days by using the ttl field. I do not store any data in the index and disabled the source field. I expect my index to stabilize around strong20 billionstrong rows. I will be putting this data into 23 named indexes. Search performance so far with up to a few billion rows is totally acceptable, but indexing performance is an issue. p  pemI am a bit confused about how ES uses shards internally. I have created two ES nodes, each with a separate data directory, each with 8 indexes and 1 replica. When I look at the cluster status, I only see one shard and one replica for each node. Doesnt each node keep multiple indexes running internally Checking the ondisk storage location shows that there is definitely only one Lucene index present.em  Resolved, as my index setting was not picked up properly from the config. Creating the index using the API and specifying the number of shards and replicas has now produced exactly what I wouldve expected to see.p  pemAlso, I tried running multiple copies of the same ES node from the same configuration, and it recognizes that there is already a copy running and creates its own working area. These new instances of nodes also seem to only have one index ondisk.em  Now that each node is actually using multiple indices, a single node with many indices is more than sufficient to throttle the entire system, so this is a nonissue.p  pWhen do you start additional Elasticsearch nodes, for maximum indexing performance Should I have many nodes each running with 1 index 1 replica, or fewer nodes with tons of indexes Is there something Im missing with my configuration in order to have single nodes doing more work p  pAlso Is there any metric for knowing when an HTTPonly node is overloaded Right now I have one node devoted to HTTP only, but aside from CPU usage, I cant tell if its doing OK or not. When is it time to start additional HTTP nodes and split up your indexing software to point to the various nodesp

Negative 2193 pOK here we go again.  Steve has to program another nonstandard set of key strokes. We have an editable JTextPane embedded in a JScrollPane.  This pane correctly handles the Up and Down arrow keys, but I cant figure out how.  If I could figure out how, I could implement the nonstandard things I need to implement.  p  pSpecifically, because the PageDown key is globally mapped to doing another function we dont do the default actions for PageUp, PageDown,CtrlPageUp and CtrlPageDown.  Instead we want to map these functions to the shifted arrow keys, not the ones on the numeric keypad.  p  pSpecifically in the JScrollPane classs ancestor  input map InputMapUIManager.getScrollPane.ancestorInputMap we add thep  ul liShifted Down Arrow key to the Ancestor input map pointing to thescrollDown actionli liShifted Up Arrow key to the Ancestor input map pointing to the scrollUp actionli liShifted Left Arrow key to the Ancestor input map pointing to the scrollHome actionli liShifted Right Arrow key to the Ancestor input map pointing to the scrollEnd actionli ul  pNone of these keystrokes do anything.  Ivwe even overridden the processKeyEvent and processKeyBinding methods of JComponent to log what was going on, and I find that these methods are never fired by these keystrokes.  Also, the plain standard up arrow and down arrow keystrokes do not fire these methods, even though these keystrokes do work.p  pSo it seems clear that something else is handling these keystrokes.  But what component is that And yes, the text pane does have focus when I am trying this.p

Negative 2193 pSo Im trying to build a C project in Mono.  I want to include a reference to codeSystem.Deploymentcode conditional on the presence or absence of the codeMonoCScode constant that the Mono Compiler defines.  Im not sure if those constants are even defined yet when MSBuild gets a hold of my .csproj though.p  pI think I might have to Add a Mono configuration which would define a MONO constant and then i can remove the reference to codeSystem.Deploymentcode and conditionally compile the lines i need with an codeif MONOcode command...but it would be so much easier if I could simply add codeConditionDefinedMonoCScode to the line in question and call it good...p

Negative 2193 pOOP allows for inheritance for abstract methods, thus every child with own implementation. Such ability cascades to coding an application in general, as such, it calls to one same message at different times and receive different output according to the type of child instantiated. This concept is known as Polymorphism.p  pPicture it that Polymorphism gives a developer a chance to create an object. This object can be assigned a reference to one of multiple classes instances that both contain a method of the same signature but of different implementation. This assignment is through conditional statements. Thereafter calling the method using this object, which in turn, happens to perform different operations depending on the appropriate condition.p  pWith the same view but now we are dealing with a Java Application that has many packages that both contain a Class of the same name. A scenario all users of the Application go through a Login class then routes to a Main Menu screen Main class. There are two different users thus two versions of the Main class, each of which are in two packages be it admin and user, in turn, acting as an entry point for the rest of the appropriate package.p  pIs there a Polymorphism mimic to let us declare an object in the Login class, of which during authentication, then assign a reference to either package mapping from the user typep  pThereafter, calling codereference.Main.setVisibletruecode will open the Main class for the type of the current login user.p

Negative 2193 pSo I have a native C application, and it needs to keep track of lots of things over long periods of time.  Its running out of memory when task manager says that the process reaches somewhere between 800 and 1200 MB of memory, when the limit emshouldem be about 2GB.p  pI finally got a clue as to whats going on when I ran VMMap against my process, but that just gave me more questions.  What I discoveredp  ul liThe total size type total, column size is emmuchem larger than what task managerprocess explorer were reportingli liThe total size seems to actually be the value that cant exceed 2GB before my program runs out of memoryli liThe memory usage discrepency is almost entirely caused by Private Data  there is much more size than there is committed.  I have seen cases where there were around 800MB of committed private data, but a Size of around 1700MB.li liThe largest blocks of Private Data mainly consist of a pattern of pairs of one small subblock between 4K and 16K, generally that has ReadWrite protection and is fully committed, and one larger subblock between 90K and 400K that has the Reserved protection and is not committed.  This seems like a huge waste of resources.  And theres usually one large many megabytes subblock at the end that is Reserved and not committed.li liThe small part of the pair generally has strings that I recognize, while the larger block has no strings at all.li ul  pAn example of these subblock pairs not my application, but the idea is the same a hrefhttpwww.flickr.comphotos95123032N005280550393 relnofollowhttpwww.flickr.comphotos95123032N005280550393ap  pIt seems as though when one block of private data gets fully committed, a new block usually the same or double the size of the previous largest block gets allocated.  Sounds fair.  However, I have seen 3 blocks, all more than 100MB each, with less than 30MB committed.  My application shouldnt behave in such a way i.e. use up 400MB then shrink by 300MB in a matter of a few hours that that would be possible.p  pAs far as I can tell, the Size is the actual amount of virtual memory address space that has been allocated.  Committed is the amount of Size that is actually being used i.e. through calls to newmalloc.  If that is indeed the case, then why is there such a huge discrepency between Size and Commited  And why is it allocating blocks that are multiple hundreds of megabytes in sizep  pThe somewhat strange thing is that the behavior is entirely different when running on Windows 7.  Whereas on 2003 Server, the application uses Private Data, on Windows 7, the application uses Heap.  So...why  Why does VMMap show primarily private data usage on 2003, but primarily heap usage on 7  Whats the difference  Well one difference is that I cant use the Heap Allocations... button in VMMap to see where all of that Private Data is being allocated.p  pI was beginning to wonder if excessive use of stdstring was causing this problem since the strings that I recognized in the pairs mentioned above primarily consisted of strings stored in stdstring that were frequently being created and destroyed implying lots of memory allocationdeallocation.  I converted all I could to use character arrays or using memory from a memory pool, but that seems to have had no effect.  All of my other objects that are newdeleted frequently already have their own memory pools.p  pI also found out about the low fragmentation heap, so I tried enabling that, but it also didnt make a difference.  Im thinking its because windows 2003 is not actually using the heap proper.  VMMap shows that the low fragmentation heap is enabled, but since its not actually used i.e. its using Private Data instead, it doesnt actually make a difference.p  pWhat actually seems to be happening is that those subblock pairs are fragmenting the large Private Data blocks, which is causing the OS to allocate new blocks.  Eventually, the fragmentation gets so bad that even though theres lots of uncommitted space, none of it seems to be usable and the process runs out of memory.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liWhy is Windows Server 2003 using Private Data instead of Heap  Does it matter Is there a way to make Windows Server 2003 use Heap memory instead If so, would that improve my situation at allli liIs there any way to control how Private Data is allocated by the OSs memory allocatorli liIs it possible to create my own custom heap and allocate off of that without changing the majority of my codebase, and could that improve my situation  I know its possible to make custom heaps, but as far as I can tell, you need to explicitly allocate from the custom heap instead of just calling new or just using STL containers normally.li liIs there anything Im missing or would be worth tryingli ol

Average time of this query execution and showing results on a webpage is 14 ms. Three simple queries, processing in php and showing results on a webpage took 21 ms. Average is based on 10 cases, average execution time was, really, a constant time.p

Or is my only option to add foreign keys manuallyp  hr  pFor example, given the following domain class as superclassp  precodeclass Product      String productCode      static mapping           tablePerHierarchy false       codepre  pAnd the following domain class as subclassp  precodeclass Book extends Product      String isbn  codepre  pThis results in the creation of two tables, the codeProductcode table and the codeBookcode table. When creating a Book  through scaffolded pages, for instance  a record is inserted into each table, their only link being the fact that the ID value is the same for each. Specifically, the data might look like thisp  precodePRODUCT Id      Version     ProductCode 1       1           BLAH02X1  BOOK Id      ISBN 1       12345678910111 codepre  pBecause there is no formal relationship defined at the database level for these tables, it is possible to delete one of the records and leave the other, which results in invalid data. Obviously I can use SQL to manually create a foreign key constraint on the two ID fields, but I was hoping to let Grails handle that. Is this possiblep  hr  pUsing Grails 2.2.1p
Negative 2193 pI am using a CSSbased approach to crop images to fit a specific aspect ratio. On the backend, I access the images height and width, and absolutely position the image within a spanwrapper given the difference in aspectratio between the image and the space its being cropped to. The backend code is irrelevant to my concern here, but the front end code works like thisp  precodelta hrefsomelinkurlgt     ltspan classcroppedImageWrapper styleheight115pxwidth115px titleSome titlegt     ltimg srcsomeurlforimgwithaspectratio1.36 styleheight100top0pxleft28px gt     ltspangt ltagt  .croppedImageWrapper      displayinlineblock     position relative     overflow hidden     .croppedImageWrapper img      position absolute  codepre  pIt works well in all browsers I need to support, except for IE7 when I place a code.croppedImageWrappercode inside a link, it seems to emcover upem the link, making it unclickable. I have been dealing with this with a simple check in jQueryp  precodeif .browser.msie ampamp parseInt.browser.version, 10  7 codepre  p... I can then attach a clickevent to the span, grab the href of its parent link, and redirect. But now that Ive upgraded to jQuery 1.9.1, this no longer works  code.browsercode is deprecated in favor of feature detection.p  pstrongSo my question is strongp  pHow could one use feature bug detection to sniff out this bug Or will I just have to hack back in an IE version detectorp

Negative 2193 pI am trying to build a dropdown filter search for a database and it seems to be that it is conflicting with the logic statements for ascendingdescending order I have in place. p  pWhen I tried to move the ifstatements of the dropdown menu filter above the ascendingdescending ordering statements, the filter does not work properly, i.e. when I try to filter for Analyzed it gives me another statuses too. p  pOn the other hand, when i tried to move the ifstatements of the dropdown filter below the ordering statements, the filter search works fine but when trying to order the table I get a sql undefined error.p  precode    printltform actionpatients.php methodgetgt      cs  case status     printltselect namecsgt                  ltoption selectedselected valuegtSelect Case Statusltoptiongt                 ltoption value1gtPassltoptiongt                 ltoption value2gtFailedltoptiongt                 ltoption value3gtPass With Errorltoptiongt                 ltoption value4gtIndeterminateltoptiongt           ltselectgt      sf  status flagged     printltselect namesfgt                 ltoption selectedselected valuegtSelect Flagged Statusltoptiongt                 ltoption valueAnalyzedgtAnalyzed Caseltoptiongt                 ltoption valueNew CasegtNew Caseltoptiongt                 ltoption valueUpdated CasegtUpdated Case New Imagesltoptiongt                 ltoption valueNonegtNo Status Flagltoptiongt           ltselectgt      printltinput typesubmit namesearch valueSearchgtltformgt     printlta href  patients.phpcasefailedgtView Failed Casesltagtltbrgtltbrgt             printflttable border1gtlttrgtltthgtlta href patients.phppIDsgtPatient IDltagt,emptyGET[pID]  GET[pID]  asc  desc  asc     printfltthgtltthgtlta href patients.phpcaseStatussgtCase Statusltagt,        emptyGET[caseStatus]  GET[caseStatus]  asc  desc  asc     printfltthgtltthgtSub StatusltthgtltthgtNumber of CasesltthgtltthgtStatus Reasonltthgtltthgtlta href patients.phpdateReviewedsgtDate Reviewedltagt,        emptyGET[dateReviewed]  GET[dateReviewed]  asc  desc  asc     printfltthgtltthgtlta href patients.phpstatusFlagsgtStatus Flagltagt,        emptyGET[statusFlag]  GET[statusFlag]  asc  desc  asc     printfltthgtlttrgt      search filter, takes the case status cs and status flag sf and filter according to selection         if issetGET[cs] ampamp issetGET[sf]               cs GET[cs]             sf GET[sf]              if sfNULL ampamp csNULL                      sql  SELECT patientid, substatuslookup.CASESTATUS, substatuslookup.SUBSTATUS, countcaseid as casescount, cases.comments, datemod, caseid, usermod, statusflag  FROM cases, substatuslookup                     Where cases.status  .cs.

Negative 2193 pI have a jsp and custom tag to load that is basically a portion of my html code.  The event that triggers the page to call the custom tag is onclick from a button using ajax to reload it.  The problem Im having is that when it reaches the custom tag to esentially refresh a portion of my page  the page has checkboxs on them, one is checked it doesnt entirely refresh that part of the page because I have checkboxes that would get unchecked on the page.  This is an ajax problem that Im having. Does anyone know why this is happening I have other events such as dropdown box and load the same custom tag and it refreshes the page to include the refresh of the checkboxs. Has someone else run into this beforep

We also want to show mobile previews of the site with smaller resolution iFrames so that they may see what their visitors would see if they came to the website on a phone.

Negative 2193 pIm running a suite of some 2000 performance tests on our software for every code change that someone makes and for each test I collect 5 to 10 samples. I have a history of performance results for thousands of code changes.p  pWhen someone makes a code change that causes the test to run slower, I want to be told as soon as possible though I can wait for results from another 1 or 2 code changes.p  pThats the gist of the problem.p  pThere is some natural variance in these tests, and we will see occasional spikes that are just noise, maybe because some background process on the computer was doing something that caused the test to run slower this time. I do NOT want to be notified when the test ran slower for such reasons. I understand there will still be some type I error, but I want to minimize it.p  pAlmost all code changes have no real effect on performance, and those that do usually effect a subset specific tests.p  pBut because essentially any code change throughout our history can have changed meanstandard deviationwhatever, using that history seems precarious.p  pBut my problem seems like one that cant be completely unique.

The y axis is represents time the test took lower is better, and the x axis is each of our code changes over time from oldest to newest.

Likewise towards the end of the graph, that was a real loss, followed by a real gain.

The idea is to do this without a page refresh.  I currently use wordpress, and this is for a plugin. Additionally, I use ISSET to post, without a separate file. That may need to change based on what I read about implementing this feature.  p  pThe newupload controls inserting a pictures postid into a separate table. I am aware of the lack of validation in place, I am not to sure how to implement that so instead I took the JS validation approach. p

When I look in the network tab, the .css file is served as texthtml instead of textcss. This means that the browser doesnt interpret it as a stylesheet but as a html document, automatically wrapping the content in a  tag because it thinks its missing.

Negative 2193 pI am trying to confirm whether data from the executable would always get mapped to the same address in process space after reading a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc301805.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc301805.aspxa. I.e. image base and base of data are defined in the PE of my executable. So I know where the data segment will start in process space when I add image base to base of data. The question is is this guaranteed or can OS decide to relocate this to a different address in memory   I tried this on a few Windows XP 32bit machines and the assumption is correct  the address stays the same and internal pointers stored in the exe dont need any modifications, but on Windows 7 64bit running the same 32bit executable all the data was shifted and pointers patched. This one is not so important tough as my main question is about the consistency of addresses on a 32bit Windows OS.  Thanksp

Node 2 has type 1, zero up edges, and 2 down edges, 1 and 3 Node 3 has type 2, one up edge, 1, and 1 down edge, 2.p  pThis info is clearly readable by human, but I am having issues writing a parser to take this information and store it in usable form.p  pI have written a sample codep  precodef  openCdata, r lines  f.readlines numofnodes  lines[0] nodes   counter  0 skipnext  False for line in lines[1]     new  False     left  False     right  False     if line  n         counter  1         nodes[counter]  []         new  True         continue     nodes[counter].appendline.replacen,  codepre  pWhich kinda gets me the info split for each node.

Negative 2193 pI have a layout in an android app that is misbehaving. Right now, it looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgxQlp.png altenter image description herep  pThe idea is to have 3 images with their reflections as separate images lined up below them. If I just have the images only the first nested LinearLayout, shown below then the images show up just fine, in their native resolution and evenly spaced apart. But with the second linearlayout added in the reflections, the images are shown much smaller than they should be.p  pThose reflection images in the pic are showing up the right size, and the images should be just as wide as the reflections, natively. If they were showing up properly, then the top of the images to the bottom of the reflections should fill the height of the screen. But theyre not. Ive tried lots of combinations of layoutwidth and layoutheight on the imageviews and the linearlayouts also different scaleTypes, but nothing is preventing the images from shrinking for some reason.

Negative 2193 pIm starting the process of converting an app to Core Data.  I built the data model and, at first, got Xcode to successfully create codeNSManagedObjectcode custom classes corresponding to the entities. But then I realized the entity and class names didnt have my application prefix, which I thought would dramatically increase the workload of required coding changes for the conversion to Core Data.  p  pSo I removed the references to the custom classes, renamed my entities in the data model with my prefix, reset the class attribute for each entity to default, and tried to create the custom classes again. I get through the wizard just as before, but now Xcode refuses to create classes for the entities, and instead creates one headerimplementation pair with the application name. The .h and .m files correspond to the entity Im classing or the last entity in the list when I select multiple, but the names and relationships are invalid, of course, and so are useless. Can anyone explain why Xcode is doing this, and how to resolve itp

Negative 2193 pI am trying to change Views position, scale and alpha with touch events at the time. When user touches a view and makes some movement the view should be effected. It is like applying combined animation via touch distance instead of time. p  pI can also calculate interpolated value for distance. For example if I move my finger half of the target distance I have the interpolation value 0,5.p  pActually I could achieve this by changing the margins around the view but it only works with ImageView. Otherwise the position of the elements change during applying the effects. Like TextViews in RelativeLayoutp  pSo I thought that I can create a combined animation and use my own interpolated value instead of the time interpolation. I hope it is possible.p

Then Id have to take the timezone into account again whenever I want to display the date in text format.pli lipFudge it by pretending that all events happen in New York. An event at midnight on January 1 in Chicago and Pheonix would have the same timestamp. Since my server is set to New York, I wouldnt have to take the timezone into account for each event.pli ol  pWhich approach is better Approach 1 gives a more true timestamp, but approach 2 seems less complex while still giving the same result.p

I agree, having such custom setter both for making customisations of inner data, and assigning outlets is convenient everything is in one place, but Im worried its breaking the normal flow of view initialisation. We should pass only the data. Values to the outlets should be assigned in viewDidLoad method separately.

Negative 2193 pCurrently I have a codespring JMS listenercode which listens on to an codeEMS topiccode and on getting a message processes it and persists it. However, I would like to do all this under one transaction. I am aware this requires codeXAcode since there are two global resources which have to register with the codeTransaction Managercode. This can be achieved via codeJTAcode that spring provides. However, since my application is standalone, do I require to include a third party codeJTA standalonecode implementation like codeBitronixcode or codeJOTMcode. I ask this because since both are spring resources, the default codeJTAcode should handle this.p

Negative 2193 pUsually this is the stuff i would spend a few hours browsing google and stackoverflow for, however i ran into the problem of how the heck do i word this for a search engine.p  pI hoping there is a simple way of achieving this, as my current method feels far to hackish p  pWhat I need to do, if track when several sources of data have completed their loading, and only when all have completed do i load a new view this is WPF mvvm. Now the data is loaded via a static class termed Repository each one creates a thread and ensure they only a single load operation can happen at once to avoid multiple threads trying to load into the same collection, each of these classes fires an event called LoadingCompleted when they have finished loading.p  pI have a single location that loads a large portion of the data for the first time, there are other locations where the data is reloaded however what i planned was to hook into each repositories OnLoaded event, and keep track of which have already returned, and when one is returned, mark it as loaded and check to see if any remain. If none remain load the new view, else do nothing.p  pSomething like thisp  precodeShipmentRepository.LoadingComplete  ShipmentRepositoryLoadingComplete ContainerRepository.LoadingComplete  ContainerRepositoryLoadingComplete  void ContainerRepositoryLoadingCompleteobject sender, EventArgs e             containerLoaded  true            CheckLoaded    void ShipmentRepositoryLoadingCompleteobject sender, EventArgs e             shipmentsLoaded  true            CheckLoaded   private void CheckLoaded      ifshipmentsLoaded ampamp containersLoaded ampamp packagesLoaded              LoadView       codepre  pHowever as i mentioned this feels clumbsy and hackish, I was hoping there was a cleaner method of doing this.p

Negative 2193 pIn order to make it easier to write code for 64bit architectures apple introduced quite a while ago codeNSIntegercode or codeNSUIntegercode data type. This data type is declared in foundation framework. So basically if I want to write code 64bit clean using basic foundation framework I can do it easily. The problem appears if I want to use float 64bit aka codeCGFloatcode. As I can understand all geometry functions, structures etc. were intended to be used in relation to user interface in case of codeCGFloatcode I dont understand why do I need to import UIKit framework. Is it sort of oversight from apples side Is it intentional Is there anything equivalent to codeCGFloatcode in foundation   p

How do I do this All help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. p  pEDITp  pOk, so I should have been clearer on this.

For example, if I enter at reception today and then go through security tomorrow, then all I should have to enter in security is why Im entering the business again, I shouldnt have to put my details in a second time. How do I go about this As I already said, I know how to code the database, but I want to know how to do what I stated in my question. p  pThanks in advance for all help given.p

If i click next , it should not display any events as i dont have any events in the next month. but when i go to the month of jan , 2015 , it should show one event because i have binded one event in the month of january. but it displays the previous month events as well as current month events. how to solve this problem.p  phtmlp  precodeltdiv idcalendargtltdivgt lti classfa fashield fa2xgtltigt ltdiv idupcominggt     ltdiv classlinesgt         ltdiv idhiddengtltdivgt codepre  pjs p  precodewindow.loadfunction      upcoming.hide     .ajax         type GET,         dataType json,         url kupArj.json,         cache false,         success functiondata               eventData  data             eventDataFneventData             eventupdateFneventData             calendar.onclick, .fcbuttonnext,function                 upcoming.hide             formaterdata                      .fa2x.clickfunction      upcoming.toggleslow           function  formatereventData          var s  h2.html     console.logs     var format1  new moments     var start1  format1.formatYYYYMMDD     var splitStart1  start1.split     var month  splitStart1[1]     var years  splitStart1[2]     for var i  0 i lt eventData.length i      var s1  eventData[i].start     var dd  new moments1     var start  dd.formatYYYYMMDD     var splitStart  start.split     console.logmonth,splitStart[1]     if month  splitStart[1]        upcoming.appendeventData[i].titleltbrgteventData[i].msgltbrgtltdiv classlinesgt      else          console.logeventData                   initialize the external events               externalevents div.externalevent.eachfunction              create an Event Object httparshaw.comfullcalendardocseventdataEventObject          it doesnt need to have a start or end         var eventObject               title .trimthis.text  use the elements text as the event title                    store the Event Object in the DOM element so we can get to it later         this.dataeventObject, eventObject             initialize the calendar              function eventDataFneventData           calendar.fullCalendar              header                  left prev,next,                 center title,                 right month,agendaWeek,agendaDay             ,             eventRender functionevent, element                  element.popover                     title event.title,                     placement auto,                     html true,                     trigger hover,                     animationtrue,                     content event.msg                                  body.onclick, functione                      if element.ise.target ampamp element.hase.target.length  0 ampamp .popover.hase.target.length  0                         element.popoverhide                              ,             events eventData                         function eventupdateFneventData          var date  new Date         for i  0 i lt eventData.length i              var s  eventData[i].start             var dd  new moments             var start  dd.formatYYYYMMDD             var mon  date.getMonth  1              var year  dd.year             var splitStart  start.split             var day  date.getDate             if mon  splitStart[1]                  upcoming.appendeventData[i].titleltbrgteventData[i].msgltbrgtltdiv classlinesgt                              else                              console.logfail                            codepre
Negative 2193 pIm working on a Magento marketplace where the client would like to use paypal delayed chain as payment method.

When the time comes to pay vendors, all vendors will be paid at once based on transaction id or paykey which used to create payment. p  pI need to implement this scenario in Magento.

Negative 2193 pIm converting my existing blog, a hrefhttpcodeinsider.us relnofollowCode Insidera, to Jekyll. Currently its a simple static site backed by flask  frozenflask with some custom functions, and Jekyll seems to have a good community around it, so I figured I may as well start using it instead of my existing semijanky custom setup.p  pWhat makes this interesting is that the blog content is nontrivial, and highly structured. There are three conversations in every post  codeinsider.usi5.html  and they have a name, description, img headshot, and set of QAs attached. THeres also metadata bout the issue itself name, introduction, timestamp, etcp  pBasically what Im doing now is assigning each questionanswer pair of strings to a tuple, shoving that into a list, assigning the list to a a Conversation dict, shoving each Conversation into a list. The list of Conversations, plus metadata, is the entirety of my blogs content.p  pConverting this to Jekyll has been a bit interesting. Jekyll doesnt do dynamism well in its front matter or the page content object.p  pIve basically settled on a hack that exploits Jekylls front matter  in each Jekyll Post that corresponds to a conversation, Im creating a listofdictsp  precodename Interview with Vincent intro Hello this is the intro title CoderPad interview conversations     name Vincent     qas          question First question          answer First answer     name John     qas          question Second question          answer Second answer         question Third question          answer Third answer codepre  petc. Is there a better way of doing this in Jekyll Keep in mind that these questionanswers can be emveryem long.p  pHeres the core loop in the parent template that Im trying to implement, and have data passed to.

Negative 2193 pSo I have a cube that I wish to rotate around any of its three axes the axes of the cube, not the window. As many other similar questions have stated, my rotations work as long as I am only rotating in one direction, but when I start mixing them, I get strange results. In particular, the rotation about the yaxis always rotates about the yaxis of the window, regardless of how the cube has been rotated.p  pMy drawing code is as followsp  precodeglMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW  glLoadIdentity gluLookAt0.0, 5.0, 15.0,             0.0, 0.0, 0.0,             0.0, 1.0, 0.0 glPushMatrix glRotatefthetay,0,1,0  glRotatefthetax,1,0,0 glRotatefthetaz,0,0,1 drawcube glPopMatrix codepre  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7724840isitpossibletorotateanobjectarounditsownaxisandnotaroundthebasecThisa question seems to describe pretty much exactly what I am trying to do, and the accepted answer seems to be what I want to do, however the link he provides is dead.p  pFrom what I can gather in the linked question, my zrotation is performed first, which means in my xrotation which would be next I need to, instead of rotating about 1,0,0, I would rotate about sinthetaz,costhetaz,0. But then for the third rotation, he only gives the link, saying it gets very complicated. Now that the link is dead, Im not sure how to go about this third rotation.p  pEDIT Based on the replies, I have added three vectors codecubexcode, codecubeycode, and codecubezcode to hold the current axes of my cube.They are initialized as followsp  precodefloat cubex[]  1.0f,0.0f,0.0f,0.0f float cubey[]  0.0f,1.0f,0.0f,0.0f float cubez[]  0.0f,0.0f,1.0f,0.0f codepre  pBack in my drawing function, I have changed it so that the rotations are done around these axes rather than the global axes as I had previously. After performing the three rotations, I call codeglGetFloatvcode to get the current matrix and use a new function, codeupdatevectorcode to fill my cube vectors with their new values. This all is included belowp  precodevoid updatevectorfloat vector[],float matrix[]      vector[0]  matrix[0]vector[0]  matrix[1]vector[1]  matrix[2]vector[2]  matrix[3]vector[3]     vector[1]  matrix[4]vector[0]  matrix[5]vector[1]  matrix[6]vector[2]  matrix[7]vector[3]     vector[2]  matrix[8]vector[0]  matrix[9]vector[1]  matrix[10]vector[2]  matrix[11]vector[3]     vector[3]  matrix[12]vector[0]  matrix[13]vector[1]  matrix[14]vector[2]  matrix[15]vector[3]    void mydisplayvoid      glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBITGLDEPTHBUFFERBIT       glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW      glLoadIdentity     gluLookAt0.0, 5.0, 15.0,             0.0, 0.0, 0.0,             0.0, 1.0, 0.0      glPushMatrix     glRotatefthetay,cubey[0],cubey[1],cubey[2]      glRotatefthetax,cubex[0],cubex[1],cubex[2]     glRotatefthetaz,cubez[0],cubez[1],cubez[2]      get the current matrix     float mymatrix[16]     glGetFloatvGLMODELVIEWMATRIX, mymatrix      Multiply the matrix by each of my vectors     updatevectorcubex,mymatrix     updatevectorcubey,mymatrix     updatevectorcubez, mymatrix      makecube     glPopMatrix       buffer is ready      glutSwapBuffers      return   codepre  pNow when I try to rotate about the y axis, the cube seems to wobble around along a few axes for a little bit before finally settling into a rotation about the xaxis. Rotating about Z does the same thing. Only rotating about the xaxis seems to work.p  pEDIT emSOLUTIONemp  pIn his comment below, Gavin mentioned that the Yaxis rotation was always happening first. This is the whole issue. By adding a flag codeROTcode and setting it based on which axis I am attempting to rotate around, I am able to order the rotations so that the axis being rotated about is done last.p

Negative 2193 pThis does not seem possible, so my guess is I am thinking of how to handle my data incorrectly, not simply that I cant find a way to handle it the way I envision.  I wanted to create a 3dimensional array I am thinking of this like a relational database. All dimensions would have the same number of rows, but they have different number of columns.  For example, p  ul lidimension 1  1 column, 20 unique location identifiers rowsli lidimension 2  3 columns of abiotic variables associated with the 20 unique locations rowsli lidimension 3  2 columns of biotic variables associated with the 20 unique locations rowsli ul  pI was thinking this would be the best way to set up my data so that I could go through each column easily and combine within abiotic or biotic easily just using subscripting e.g., I could apply a function across all varibles columns in the 2nd abiotic dimension e.g., dat[,,2]  logdat[,,2], which might be different than something I want to do to all biotic variables.p  pThis is a not a treatment group type of analysis, so I dont want stacked data where I repeat the unique locations 5 times with multiple treatment options for each location  that makes no sense to me for these data, e.g., p  precodeloc   type   var 1      ab     1 1      ab     2 1      ab     3 1      bi     1 1      bi     2 codepre  pI am frozen in the way I am thinking about these data. In the past Ive always used arrays and the subscripting is so intuitive to me. Can you indeed make an array that has different number of columns in each dimension If not, what am I missing about how to handle these data  Thanks for any thoughts.p

Negative 2193 pI have a report per client and within this report I have several sub reports, each within their own group.  The SRs are referencing views I have created in the connected MS SQL database which show the particular client records.p  pId like to show two SRs on the same group level, but which reference different views in MS SQL.  The issue Ive come across is that where SR1 has data relating to the client but SR2 does not, no information is being shown in either SR1 or SR2 within the grouped layer.p  pIdeally Id like to keep the SRs separate, although I guess I could create a new view in MS SQL just tying these two sets of data together.p  pIs there something Im missing in Crystal Reports which basically says Show all data from SR1 results, even if SR2 results are null.p  pI hope that makes sense.

Negative 2193 pI have an application which requests a Twitter timeline and displays it to the user, independent of user authentication. Multiple instances of the application are running simultaneously and each instance requests the timeline for a different Twitter screen name, say once every fifteen minutes.p  pThe problem I have is that since I am using applicationonly authentication there is no user interaction with the UI and each instance is running behind a shared IP proxy, the same access token is returned for each request and hence the rate limit is always exceeded.p  pIs there any way of generating a new instance of the Twitter response request for each instance of the application, or similar, to overcome this issuep

Negative 2193 pIve been working on state space exploration and was originally using a map to store the assignment of the world states like codemapltVariable , intgtcode, where variables are objects in the world with a domain from 0 to n where n is finite. The implementation was extremely quick for performance, but I noticed that it does not scale well with the size of the state space. I changed the states to use codevectorltintgtcode instead, where I use the id of a variable to find its index in the vector. Memory usage improved greatly, but the efficiency of the solver has tanked gone from lt30 seconds to 400. The only code that I modified was generating the states and validating if the state is the goal. I cant figure out why using a vector has degraded performance, especially since the vector operations should only take linear time at worst.p  pOriginally this is was how I generated nodesp  precodeState  SuccessorGengeneratesuccessorconst Operator ampop, mapltVariable , intgt ampvarassignment      mapltVariable , intgt values     values.insertvarassignment.begin, varassignment.end     vectorltOperatorEffectgt effect  op.geteffect     vectorltOperatorEffectgtconstiterator effit  effect.begin      for  effit  effect.end effit         values[effitgtvar]  effitgtafter          return new Statevalues  codepre  pAnd in my new implementationp  precodeState SuccessorGengeneratesuccessorconst Operator ampop, const vectorltintgt ampassignment      vectorltintgt child     child  assignment      vectorltOperatorEffectgt effect  op.geteffect     vectorltOperatorEffectgtconstiterator effit  effect.begin      for  effit  effect.end effit         Variable v  effitgtvar         int id  vgtgetid         child[id]  effitgtafter          return new Statechild  codepre  pThe goal checking is similar, just looping over the goal assignment instead of operator effects.p  pAre these vector operations really that much slower than using a map Is there an equally efficient STL container I can use that has a lower overhead The number of variables is relatively small lt50 and the vector never needs to be resized or modified after the for loop.p  pEditp  pI tried timing one loop through all the operators to see timing comparisons, with the effect list and assignment the vector version runs one loop in 0.3 seconds, while the map version is a little over 0.4 seconds. When I comment that section out the map was about the same, yet the vector jumped up to closer to 0.5 seconds. I added codechild.reserveassignment.sizecode but that did not make any change.p  pEdit 2p  pFrom user63710s answer, Ive also been digging through the rest of the code and noticed something really strange going on in the heuristic calculation. The vector version works fine, but for the map I use this line codeNode n  new Nodei, transition.value, labelcost openlist.pushncode, but once the loop finishes filling the queue the node gets totally screwed up. Nodes are a simple struct asp  precodestruct Node      Source Value, Destination Value     int from     int to     int distance     Nodeint ampf, int ampt, int ampd  fromf, tot, distanced  codepre  pInstead of having codefrom, to, distancecode, it replaces codefromcode and codetocode with codeidcode with some random number, and that search does not do what it should and is returning much faster then it should. When I tweak the map version to convert the map to a vector and run this p  pcodeNode ni, transition.value, labelcost openlist.pushncode  the performance is about equal to that of the vector. So that fixes my main issue, but this leaves me wondering why using codeNode ncode gets this behaviour opposed to codeNode ncodep

Negative 2193 pIm looking for a way to broadcast data over wifi to exchange data between unpaired devices. Im imagining a protocol similar to how low energy Bluetooth sends data via advertising packets. I would use BT LE, but I need a wider range and something that can go through at least 12 walls. I would also prefer not to have to connect to each discovered device before transmitting like in direct wifi, since eventually this application could have many 10s or 100s of available devices to interact with.  Can anyone point me in the direction of a library or framework that would enable me to do this p  pThe end goal is to implement this on a mobile device, but at this point I cant find anything that allows for this type of broadcasting.  Any ideas would be of great help. p  pThanks. p

Negative 2193 pI would like to branch and decide on a Trait implementation to use within a function at runtime see codepolyreadcode in the code sample below. The trait object is constructed inside of the branch arms of an if expression and only needs to live for the life of codepolyreadcode yet I need to codeBoxcode it because the trait cant be borrowed from within the expression arm, up to the binding that Im attempting to assign it to.p  pI understand logically why the borrow ends too early, but it seems like the borrow checker should be able to extend the borrow up to the surrounding scope when the if expressions value is bound. I realize this is probably a naive notion, but Id like to understand more about why its not possible.p  pIm a bit unhappy with the solution I have now because it requires a heap allocation even though I feel like I shouldnt need one, since I only hold onto the box for the life of the function. I suppose this is because we dont know the size of codereadercode that would be required on the stack until the branch is taken, but couldnt it just be represented as a union in the compiler, since we at least know the maximum size.p  pAs an aside, I actually dont know how valid my concern about the codeBoxcode being heap allocated is to begin with. In general how expensive is boxing the valuep  precode[featureio] [featurepath]  const BYTES ampstatic [u8]  amp[1u8, 2, 3, 4, 5] const PATH ampstatic str  usrsharedictwords  use stdoldioFile, Reader, BufReader   fn readr ampmut Reader      let somebytes  r.readexact5.unwrap     assertsomebytes.len  5     println, somebytes   fn polyreadfromfile bool       Is there any way to extend the lifetime of the ampmut Reader in these branch arms without      boxing them as Im doing now.

Negative 2193 pLets says a Windows Service initializes a wcf client class contains Proxy to worker WCF Service and supposedly this client works through the Routing Service to map to the actual service that does the work. BeastyWorkerServicep  pI mean face it your client is configured to spew from Endpoint net.tcp10.0.0.xxsampleeppoopie, or more correctly to talk to endpoint net.tcp10.0.0.xxsampleeppoopie and the actual worker on the other end of the routingService  our BeastyWorkerService  is poised to accept on that endpoint net.tcp10.0.0.xxsampleeppoopie. p  pIf you kill the Routing Service the worker still gets the message and the work gets done..  I understand the router may be handy for broadcast protocol bridging or other tasks but Im thinking the emperor has no clothes on.. Am I wrong here  What am I missing   I Love WCF but it assuredly can be painful....p
Negative 2193 pI am using EF to update my database.p  pI first query the database based upon some criteria. This returns the record I am expecting or returns null.

Negative 2193 pIm reading some codeRTSPcode stream in an iOS app using codeFFmpegcode. If the firewall or other services stops the network from receiving via codeUDPcode, codeFFmpegcode nicely falls back to reading via codeTCPcode.

Is there a callback for this Is there a way to get the protocol that is usingp  pThank you.p

Negative 2193 pWill be putting a bounty on this  Also, Im not 100 sure what tags are relevant for thisp  pIm incredibly confused here. I am attempting to use this simplified model for my archers to collide with img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHU6Vr.png altenter image description herep  pHowever, as you can see, my archers appear to be colliding in midair I would understand if they fell through e.g. I had not put enough points in my collision model, but to actually appear to be colliding with NOTHING is absolutely baffling me.p  pIm loading the model on the server with the same code that Im displaying it there in the client, so that cant be the issue. Ive a hrefhttppastebin.comczcCB95s relnofollowpastebinned it herea anyway.p  pThen, Im adding it to three codeint[]code arrays, like thisp  precodecoordsx  new int[80  10] coordsy  new int[80  10] coordsz  new int[80  10] for javax.vecmath.Vector3f vec  m.getVertices Quick note M is a model.

Negative 2193 pIm using Symfony2 and I have some entities defined with codeORMGeneratedValuestrategyAUTOcode and codeORMSequenceGeneratorsequenceNamemysequenceseqcode. My sequences are using very big numbers they are defined as numeric22.p  pThe problem I have is that Symfony is fetching this values as integers, and this is wrong because this numbers doesnt fit in a single 32bit value. A normal sequence number can be code103500000000000000003code code1035code is some kind of table identifier, and the other numbers the sequence. Dont ask me why, weve inherited this database. But Doctrine takes this number as 2147483647 231  1 and this breaks the sequence numbers and produces PK errors.p  pMy question is can I alter the datatype Doctrine uses to read sequence numbers without modifying the core If not, do you have any idea about how to solve this problem Keep in mind that I cant alter the database or the sequence number format.p
Negative 2193 pI want to use Lucene to process several millions of news data. Im quite new to Lucene, so Im trying to learn more and more about how it is working. In every lucene document I store one news article. Every article has a time field is called PubDate. p  pI implemented for example a range query like this p  precode            IndexReader reader  DirectoryReader.openFSDirectory.opennew FilePATHTOINDEX             IndexSearcher searcher  new IndexSearcherreader              int hitsPerPage  10000             TopScoreDocCollector collector  TopScoreDocCollector.createhitsPerPage, true              Query q3  TermRangeQuery.newStringRangePubDate,                     DateTools.dateToStringnew Datee.getStart, DateTools.Resolution.MINUTE,                     DateTools.dateToStringnew Datee.getEnd, DateTools.Resolution.MINUTE, true, true              searcher.searchq3, collector             ScoreDoc[] hits  collector.topDocs.scoreDocs               for int i  0 i lt hits.length i                  do some stuff here              codepre  pCurrently Im using the praised TopScoreDocCollector which seems am I correct to return me a ranked collection by calculating TFIDF on the results of my range queries. strongALTHOUGH I asked myself on how the searchercollector should know that he has to calculate the TFIDF on the fulltextfield and not on the pubDatefield. I guess he does not, so the scoring is not useful An AnswerComment also regarding this in my case would also be really appreciatedstrong  p  pAnyway, the TopScoreDocCollector seems to be not useful for this task. The above described query should just retrieve me a sample from my lucene index.  If I for example say Show me news articles from the 10th of May to the 10th of June and if I limit the result size to 10000 I would like to get an over the Days equally distributed Collection. I know that this is perhaps not the best use of Lucene, but I want to use the great skills of lucene in the next analyzing step . p  pHow could I retrieve such kind of collection What Collector should I use I tried to implement my own collector but got stuck in researching by all the different lucene versions that do things separetely Im using lucene 4.10. I guess I could also work with a collector that just returns me 10.000 random documents in the range that I defined. p  pDo you have any advice p
Negative 2193 pHaving a little trouble doing this, I know you need to do it with codegetcode, however the examples I find dont quite fall into the structure I need.p  pMy provider looks like sop  precode     .providermoduleOb, function     var modules        outer closure to inject this     function outerAddStatemoduleObj            outer function so we can push into module     function modulePushcurrentModule, name           return          goState functionname, stateName, options                      I need to use this function in here which injected from a factory                      checkUrl.requestUrl         ,         moduleConstructor functionname, cb           ,         get function get              return this                   codepre  pSo Im just planting the get right now at the bottom as you can see. I need to be able to inject the codecheckurlcode factory somehow so I have access to it in codegoStatecode. How would I format it so I can use the get to do sop  pSo if I separate the factory out into a separate module I can inject it with p  precode   var injector  angular.injector[urlParsing]     var checkUrl  injector.getcheckUrl codepre  pinside the provider. However, the codecheckurlcode function has a dependency on codelocationcode. So the injector cannot find codelocationcode now p  precodeError [injectorunpr] Unknown provider locationProvider lt location lt checkUrl codepre  pCan I inject the location provider too Is this the best way of doing this p  pMaybe with a get location Or maybe there is a better work around. Could use some help, this has been holding me up all day Thanks for reading.p  pEdit2 After a few days of wrestling with this  I realize Im just looking how to inject multiple modules  a factory and its dependancies of log and location to a provider. The real reason being so I can let people set what I want them to set in the .config.p  pI have temporarily circumvented this by changing this provider to a factory and using the .run instead of the .config BUT I would still love to be able to use .config instead.p

Negative 2193 pIm trying to unit test a part of a project Im using NUnit. The targeted unit processes objects of several types, all extending a base type. Ive created a generic test class on which I set the desired test typesp  precode[TestFixturetypeofSomeType] [TestFixturetypeofSomeOtherType] class MyTestClassltTgt where T  SomeBaseType, new        [Test]      public void DoThisTest                var sut  CreateSut          var target  CreateTarget           Assert.IsTruesut.Processtarget               [Test]      public void DoThatTest                var sut  CreateSut          var target  CreateInvalidTarget           Assert.IsFalsesut.IsValidtarget               ...  codepre  pThis creates a set of all the tests for each type set using codeTestFixturecode. For whatever reason, I have a test which only makes sense in the context of a specific type. This means that I need to either 1 use codeAssert.Ignorecode on all other types or 2 create a different test class just for those special test cases.p  pIs there a way of opting out from a test from outside attribute and specify that that particular test must not be implemented in certain contexts I would like to combine 1 amp 2 such that all the test cases are in the same fileclass but some tests are only renderedimplementedrun for certain values set by codeTestFixturecode.p

Negative 2193 pI am developing a web service on Ubuntu 14.04 in C using cppnetlib in asynchronous mode. The service needs to respond to data sent over HTTP POST in the message body. I am observing poor performance when receiving input larger than 1K, and I want to fix that.p  pIf the data is relatively small, less than 1K, the server receives the data almost instantly. If the data is more than 1K, there is a roughly one second delay after the asynchronous read callback function is first invoked before the first chunk of actual data is presented to the callback. After the initial delay, the subsequent chunks arrive almost instantly.p  pHow can I eliminate this delay Is it an artifact of using curl to post test data How can I easily test the performance of curl for posting datap  pYou can find minimal a hrefhttpsgithub.comrandallecookasyncserversource codea demonstrating the problem on github.

I would argue that [uploads] is level one thus so far level one has only one entry. Level 2 of [uploads] has 4 entries, 2 files and 2 folders. If an entry is a folder it can have further levels, you get the picture.p  pAll this is then created in jquery as clickable divs on a page. Only the first level of course. p  pSo if the user clicks on folder1, I want to populate another array called currentdirectory with folder1 of the 2nd level of [uploads] as follows codecurrentdirectory  data[uploads][folder1]code. This array is then created as clickable divs and again the user can click on something, and if its a folder it will repopulate currentdirectory with the new folder, but this time as follows codecurrentdirectory  currentdirectory[folder1]code Or whichever folder the user clicked on.p  pNow the problem comes when I want to go back to the previous directory. How do I maybe keep track of which level Im in or something like check in data which is the whole folder structure in which keyfolder the array currentdirectory belongs. p  pJust thought you should know that no 2 keys, whether file or folder, in the same level can have the same name. And then also the files and folders will obviously not be called file1 and folder1 but user generated names.p  pOh and then, what I mean by attributes is like more keys that only files can have like [type] and [size].p

Negative 2193 pIm making an app for my exam that uses thecodeMapKitViewcode andcodeCoreLocationcode for getting different locations and adding pins to the map. p  pBut I realized that I hadnt imported the codeMapKit.frameworkcode in the build settings, which I always was told to do. What I dont understand is that everything still works without it. Im simply using import MapKit when I have to use it. p  pSo my question is Is it really necessary to import the framework in the build settings too Some of the other students said that theirs dodnt work without it.

After a second or so, the device sending the samples reports its buffer has overflowed. After some quick profiling of the code, nearly all of the execution time is spent on codestdcopy...code 99.96 of the time to be exact. If I remove this line, I can run the program for hours without encountering any overflow. p  pThat said, Im rather stumped as to how I can improve the write speed. Ive looked through several posts on this site, and it seems like the most common suggestion in regard to speed is to implement file writes as Ive already done  through the use of codestdcopycode. p  pIf its helpful, Im running this program on Ubuntu x8664. Any suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 2193 pI am new to java and I could use some help. In the following program, when I rotate the screen the ListView disappears. When I click back, then pull the app back up both of my TextViews and my ListView are cleared. I read up on this some and from what I gather its because the activity basically restarts upon these actions. I looked for a good way to save the information in these cases, but nothing I tried is working. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If my code is a mess, I apologize, like I said Im a beginner. I tried to use the onSavedInstanceState method, but I cant get it to work. I realize its probably some stupid mistake that I am making, but I have been at it for hours and I cant figure out what Im doing wrong.

Negative 2193 pAs many developers out there I get some data from a webserver via http. Since XCOde7iOS9 I need to mark the used domains as an exception in my apps plist. This worked out for all of my domains except one.p  pImportant It is no solution for me to accept all domains with emNSAllowsArbitraryLoadsem.

Negative 2193 pI have a Person database in SQL Server with tables like address, license, relatives etc. about 20 of them. All the tables have id parameter that is unique per person. There are millions of records in these tables. I need to combine theses records of the person using their common id parameter, and convert to a json table file with some column name changes. This json file then gets pushed to kafka through a producer. If I can get the example with the kafka producer as item writer fine, but real problem is understanding the strategy and specifics on how to utilize strongspring batchstrong item reader, processor, and item writer to create the composite json file. This is my first Spring batch application so I am relatively new to this.p  pI am hoping for the suggestions on the implementation strategy using a composite reader or processor to use person id as the cursor, and  query each table using the id for each table , convert the resulting records to json and aggregate it to a composite, relational json file with root table PersonData that feeds to kafka cluster. p  pBasically I have one data source, same database for the reader. I plan to use Person table to fetch id and other records unique for the person, and use id as the where clause for 19 other tables. convert each resultset from the table to json, and composite the json object at the end and write to kafka.p

Negative 2193 pUsing only PHP6 no Javascript, there have been numerous failed attempts to format a plain text email.  The primary issue seems to be either  1. the failure to successfully construct returns and line breaks in the email text andor,  2. the use of a malformed character set charset parameter. p  pYour help in resolving this matter would be appreciated. Earlier failed attempts included copying and pasting several relevant code snippets found via searching StackOverflow. Subsequent failed attempts can be seen  commented and otherwise  in the code provided here.  Note that the email data is extracted via PHP6 in the head section of the HTML5 document from the simple HTML5 form also provided here.  The PHP6 and the HTML5 occur in a single [1] file.  p  pPlease note that both the code and the HTML5 were originally indented properly when copied to paste here.p  pThe questions asked here are different than the doublesingle quotation mark matter, but consistently using the doublesingle quotes where appropriate does help part of the problem.  For example, a duplicate email is sent when the browsers refresh button is clicked in Firefox, even thoug the form data is cleared and the submit button is not clicked again.  There is also the matter of the earlier referenced character set i.e., which is more universally accepted by email services.p  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt  lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtLearning PHP6lttitlegt   ltphp      fielddisplayfeedback      echo Inside PHP and about to enter IF fielddisplayfeedback    . fielddisplayfeedback .   ltbr gt     if issetPOST[SubmitButton]              fieldsuggestion  POST[YourSuggestion]        fieldname  POST[YourName]       fieldphone  POST[YourPhone]       fieldemail  POST[YourEmail]        headersubject  Suggestion Submission       headerto  JMJustMe.com       headerfrom  From Just Me ltJMJustMe.comgt . rn        headerfrom .

Negative 2193 pGood time of day.p  pI need to protect my app from running after some period, something like trial period. For now we are generate some license file with private RSA key. Users have only public key, so they can generate something and check information in license file.  We need to add checking for trial period. There is no internet connection, so we could not get application start time from our server or something. After trial period my app should not start any more, until user will get new license.p  pBefore we send user his license, user sends us some information, that, obviously, was encoded. I think to put some start time there. Goal is to prevent program to run after users server time change.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThanks.p
