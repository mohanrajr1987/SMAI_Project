Positive 48748 pI have a question on how to approach the design of an integration. I have two models codeCompanycode and codeUsercode. In my case, users will register for my app and then be presented with the option to connect the app to their different accounts Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn so that they can viewcreate poststweetsetc. Because codeCompanycode codehasmanycode codeUserscode and the social media accounts belong to the company, I want to tie the credentials to the codeCompanycode model using another model called codeProvidercode to store the credentials, therefore allowing any user that has permission to access the companys social media account.p  pIve been following various tutorials on how to configure multiple omniauth providers, but they all focus on tying them to the user model and tell me to add codedevise omniauthablecode to my user model.p  pHow do I make codeCompanycode omniauthable instead of the user Do I even need to make my model omniauthable if Im not going to allow user authenticationregistration view omniauthp  pThis is my first time building social media integrations, so I hope my question makes sense.

If a user doesnt sign in the save and continue button is disabled, which is necessary for a user to complete their purchase without signing in.p  pedit.html.erbp  precodeltdiv classlt if order.state  confirm then colmd9 else colmd12 end gt datahookcheckoutformwrappergt   lt formfor order, url gt updatecheckoutpathorder.state, html gt  id gt checkoutformorder.state  do form gt     lt unless order.email gt       ltdiv classpanel paneldefaultgt         ltdiv classpanelbodygt           ltp classfield styleclear bothgt             lt form.label email gtltspan classrequiredgtltbr gt             lt form.textfield email gt           ltpgt            render the devise login form here           lt render devisesessionsfbform.html.erb gt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt     lt end gt      render the address form here     lt render order.state, form gt form gt   lt end gt ltdivgt codepre  pfbform.html.erbp  precodelt formforresource, as resourcename, url sessionpathresourcename, html gt class gt well do f gt   lt deviseerrormessages gt   lt bootstrapflash gt   ltdiv classfacebooklogingt     lt linkto omniauthauthorizepathresource, facebook do gt       lti classfa fafacebookgtltigt Sign in with Facebook     lt end gt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classtextcentergt     ltpgtltsmallgtBy submitting, I acknowledge that I have read, understand and agree to be bound by the leemaeats.com website lta hreftermsofusegtTerms of Useltagt and lta hrefprivacypolicygtPrivacy Policyltagt.ltsmallgtltpgt   ltdivgt lt end gt codepre  paddress.html.erbp  precodeltdiv classrowgt   ltdiv classcolxs12gt     ltdiv classwell textright formbuttons datahookbuttonsgt        this gets disabled when the fbform page is rendered       lt submittag Spree.tsaveandcontinue, class gt btn btnlg btnsuccess gt       lt if tryspreecurrentuser gt         ltdiv classcheckbox datahooksaveuseraddressgt           lt checkboxtag saveuseraddress, 1, tryspreecurrentuser.respondtopersistorderaddress gt           lt labeltag saveuseraddress, Spree.tsavemyaddress gt         ltdivgt       lt end gt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAftter much debugging and trialerror I found that sole cause of the problem is when codefbform.html.erbcode is rendered.

Positive 48748 pIm fairly new to Rails 4 and am experimenting with Devise and ldapauthenticatable and I see something that Im not sure is right. When I authenticate to my Active Directory Devise works fine and stores the user in the MySQL database as expected.  However, I seem to lose the user params and cant tell which user just authenticated.  usersignedin returns false but if I hit the login link I get the message already signed in  currentuser is nil and setuser fails because paramsid is nil.  Seems like something is broken here but Im not sure what the norm is as far as Devise setting or keeping user params alive.

The default is        just email. You can configure it to use [username, subdomain], so for        authenticating a user, both parameters are required. Remember that those        parameters are used only when authenticating and not when retrieving from        session. If you need permissions, you should implement that in a before filter.        You can also supply a hash where the value is a boolean determining whether        or not authentication should be aborted when the value is not present.       config.authenticationkeys  [email]         Configure parameters from the request object used for authentication. Each entry        given should be a request method and it will automatically be passed to the        findforauthentication method and considered in your model lookup. For instance,        if you set requestkeys to [subdomain], subdomain will be used on authentication.        The same considerations mentioned for authenticationkeys also apply to requestkeys.        config.requestkeys  []         Configure which authentication keys should be caseinsensitive.        These keys will be downcased upon creating or modifying a user and when used        to authenticate or find a user.

Positive 48748 pSo I have implemented devise for authentication I am facing a problem I need to change some of my user object right after its created and my I am also using confirmable module when I update my user object in aftercreate call back it automatically changes the confirmationtoken and I get error invalid confirmation token first time. If I resend confirmation email it works my questions how can I prevent devise to change confirmationtoken or send confirmation email automatically so that I can send updatedcorrect token.p

Negative 48748 pHeres the background. Im sorry its so longbr  I do SAS programming for 3 different projects. Each project has its own main project folder. Each main project folder contains a formats folder which contains the format catalog, and then several other folders, each of which contains programs and datasets. I do most of my work in batch mode, so SAS is usually not open. Occasionally, though, I want to open a dataset in SAS to look at something in particular. When I do this, SAS does not know where to look for the appropriate format catalog, because the format catalogs are never in the same folder as the datasets. So I currently use an autoexec.sas file that specifies the codenofmterrcode option, so that my datasets will open.p  pI would really like, though, to be able to open my datasets with the appropriate formatting. I wrote a different autoexec program that uses a dialog window that asks me which project I am working on and then sets the codefmtsearchcode option accordingly. This works great if I want to first open SAS, and then open a dataset. But if SAS is not already up and running, and I try to open a dataset by doubleclicking on it, heres what happens the autoexec file starts running, then SAS tries to open the dataset before the autoexec file has finished running. So if I have codenofmterrcode set, the dataset will open without formats, or if I dont have codenofmterrcode set, the dataset wont open at all.p  pSo heres my question Is there a way to get SAS to wait until the autoexec file finishes running before it tries to open the dataset Or, is there another way around the problem I dont want to add all 3 format files to the codefmtsearchcode option, because different projects might have different formats with the same name.p

Negative 48748 pI seem to be having a problem with extracting data from a stringstream.

Negative 48748 pI need some inspiration for a solution...p  pWe are running an online game with around 80.000 active users  we are hoping to expand this and are therefore setting a target of achieving up to 1500.000 users.p  pThe game includes a highscore for all the users, which is based on a large set of data. This data needs to be processed in code to calculate the values for each user.p  pAfter the values are calculated we need to rank the users, and write the data to a highscore table.p  pMy problem is that in order to generate a highscore for 500.000 users we need to load data from the database in the order of 2530.000.000 rows totalling around 1.52gb of raw data. Also, in order to rank the values we need to have the total set of values.br Also we need to generate the highscore as often as possible  preferably every 30 minutes.p  pNow we could just use brute force  load the 30 mio records every 30 minutes, calculate the values and rank them, and write them in to the database, but Im worried about the strain this will cause on the database, the application server and the network  and if its even possible.br Im thinking the solution to this might be to break up the problem some how, but I cant see how. So Im seeking for some inspiration on possible alternative solutions based on this informationp  ul liWe need a complete highscore of all 500.000 teams  we cant wont unless absolutely necessary shard it.  li liIm assuming that there is no way to rank users without having a list of all users values.li liCalculating the value for each team has to be done in code  we cant do it in SQL alone.li liOur current method loads each users data individually 3 calls to the database to calculate the value  it takes around 20 minutes to load data and generate the highscore 25.000 users which is too slow if this should scale to 500.000.li liIm assuming that hardware size will not an issue within reasonable limitsli liWe are already using memcached to store and retrieve cached datali ul  pAny suggestions, links to good articles about similar issues are welcome.p

Negative 48748 pfrom what Ive understood so far, by reading this doc for instance  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms404279.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms404279.aspxa, strongShadow copystrong is a feature that allows the use of an assembly while currently loaded by an application.p  pFrom the above doc p  blockquote   pThe common language runtime locks an assembly file when the assembly is loaded, so the file cannot be updated until the assembly is unloaded. The only way to unload an assembly from an application domain is by unloading the application domain, so under normal circumstances, an assembly cannot be updated on disk until all the application domains that are using it have been unloaded.   When an application domain is configured to shadow copy files, assemblies from the application path are copied to another location and loaded from that location. The copy is locked, but the original assembly file is unlocked and can be updated.p blockquote  pBut it seems like sometimes a loaded assembly is not locked and so strongShadow copystrong is useless.p  pTo illustrate this point Ive created a simple library, A.dll, with this code p  precodeusing System  public class A   public A     Console.WriteLineA    codepre  pThen I load it into an AppDomain with code like the following p  precodeusing System using System.Reflection  class Test   static void Main     AppDomainSetup configuration  new AppDomainSetup       ShadowCopyFiles  false       AppDomain appDomain  AppDomain.CreateDomain, null, configuration    Console.WriteLineappDomain.ShadowCopyFiles    Assembly assembly  appDomain.LoadA   assembly.CreateInstanceA    Console.ReadLine    assembly.CreateInstanceA    codepre  pSo I expected that while the program is hanging on the strongReadLinestrong I should not be able to use the A.dll assembly, but it appears that it is not locked at all  I can even delete it p  pSo here are my questions p  pstrong1 Why in this sample the loaded assembly is not locked strongp  pstrong2 When are assembly locked, ie when shadow copy is a useful feature strongp  pThanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 48748 pbr I need to create a WCF service that will emulate some thirdparty service.

But here the first problem occurs strongall methods in proxy havestrongbr     code[System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttributeAction  , ReplyAction  ]code So it is impossible to create WCF service with many methods each for one method in proxy because every method must have unique Action. I think that thirdparty service has one method that handles all requests. And I created such method with needed KnownType attributes on RequestTypeBase and ResponceTypeBase. All proxyclass methods have one parameter of type, derived from RequestTypeBase. strongAnd here is the main problem and questionstrong when WCF service tries to deserialize message body, it throws an exception saying that expected elementName is Process the name of my megamethod that processes all requests but existing elementName is RequestType1 the name class with data that must be passed to Process method as parameter. emSo how can I receive such message Is there some attribute in WCF to not require the methodName as root of Message body And I even not understand for what does WCF need that MethodName there if he already knows what method is called Looks like redundancy with action specification.emp  pMaybe simple MessabeBody example that is successfully processing by WCF, will help to understand what I meanp  precodeltsBodygt   ltTestMethod xmlnssomeNamespacegt     ltxgt1ltxgt     ltstrgtparam2ltstrgt   ltTestMethodgt ltsBodygt codepre

So he needed to support embothem URL formats, and have the user always end up seeing the prettified one.p  pAfter much toing and froing, we came up with the following code.htaccesscode filep  precodeRewriteEngine on   Prevents browser looping, which does seem    to occur in some specific scenarios. Cant    explain the mechanics of this problem in    detail, but there we go. RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS 200 RewriteRule .  [L]   Hardrewrite [R] to friendly URL.

Negative 48748 pI have a website, and I have to implement with PHP andor JavaScript an alert message that triggers two minutes after a visitor has entered the site.

And I need that counter keeps counting while the user navigates my sites pages.p  pOne solution could be using session variables. I can make a script that looks for this variable, if it doesnt exist means that the user is entering the site. Then I set this variable with current time.

If the user leaves the page but has other navigator windows opened, the session doesnt expire, and if he enters the site again, the counter will not be reset.p  pSo, two questionsp  ol liIs there a better method to have more control on the real entering and exiting li liIf not, is my above approach rightli ol  pThanks.p
Negative 48748 pHi I am having some problems in my app for the database timeout. Due to some network glitches the query takes more than 45 sec to return the resultset which has about 10,000 rows. Most of the time its fast upto 1112 secs. My app is runs as a scheduled job in the background.p  pThe problem is I need to try three times if i get the timeout exception before writing the error to the error log or exiting. I know i can set the command timeout property to 60 seconds but still i want to try three times before exiting. I have written a method for that but I think there is some flaw in my method. p  pFor now i specifically set the timeout to be 5 seconds as i know well that it takes more than 25 seconds for this stored proc to run.

Negative 48748 pOk, Having read so many QAs here about OpenId and OAuth like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3376141openidvsoauththisa, I hope I understand the difference between both.

Id like to hear what is others opinion about using something meant to authorize to use to authenticate. The reason why one might want to do is the same as using Open Id i.e., to ease the registration process for a new user.p  pPS Please correct me if Im still confusing the use of OpenIDOAuth.p

Negative 48748 pAs Ive been coding CC for about a year now, Ive tried to learn the preferred ways for writing good OO and C code. That means, when coding, I always look for the best ways when implementing something, rather than just typing something and checking if it works. Ive told that in C you should use references instead of raw pointers when passing arguments to functions, to make it more safe. So that would be considered as better coding. Although, in many high quality opensource projectswhich are C they use pointers instead of references. All arguments, returns and stuff are pointers rather than safer references. Even Microsofts directx uses pointers more than the safer option. I cannot see any benefits by using pointers instead of references, actually I think raw pointers are worse than referencesin situations where dynamic alloc isnt needed of course.p  pSo onto my question why most of the opensource projects use pointers, when there are better ways availablep

Negative 48748 pIn my program I am using the overlapped version of codeAcceptExcode to accept new connections. After a new connection has been accepted, the programm initiates another overlapped call to codeAcceptExcode for accepting more connections. This works fine and I can connect multiple clients to the server successfully.p  pBut if I just connect one client and let the serverapplication call WSARecv overlapped on this socket,  codeAcceptExcode magically accepts a new ghostconnection There is the first client running doing nothing. When I call codeWSARecvcode on that, of course  it gives an error.p  pThe program incorporates an strongIOCompletion Portstrong for all the overlapped calls.p  pI dont know where the fake connection comes from. But that it seems to be a bug in my code that I am unable to find.p  pThings i can definetly exclude from being the errors reason 1.The strongoverlappedstructuresstrong i use and the parameter for casting works correct. 2.

Negative 48748 pIm having one issue with Linq to Sql for Windows Phone SQL Server CE. p  pIm developing an personal finance app, and then I have the Account class and the Transaction class.

Negative 48748 pI have codeRelativeLayoutcode that consists of codeTextViewcodes that I use to inflate items in a list. The layout is like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFLiVH.png altenter image description herep  pThe larger title text is sometimes too long, so I set the codeellipsizecode attribute on the codeTextViewcode to marquee, which cuts it off as you can see in the picture. strongThe problem isstrong more subtle in the pic from the emulator but on a device you can see more clearly that that the codemarqueecode shifts the Days Lent label so they are not all aligned. Or rather, I believe the row with the marquee has the correct alignment, but the ones without the marquee get pulled further somehow.p  pThis only happens on the codemarqueecode setting and not on the regular ellipsis codeendcode, which makes me think it is something with the animation that the marquee does. I include my XML layout below so you can see how things work. Salient points from code The title TV has padding to push it away from the right edge Days Lent is positioned relative left of the 0 number the title is codealignParentLeftcode and the 0 number is codealigneParentRightcode.p  pIve tried changing the padding on Days Lent and messing with the codemarqueeRepeatLimitcode, as well as just using a regular ellipsis.p  pSo strongWhy does this misalignment happen to the adjacent codeTextViewcode when marquee is usedstrongp  pThanks.p  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidlayoutwidthfillparent androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt ltTextView     androidididtitle     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidtextSize24sp      androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue     androidpaddingRight70dp     androidpaddingTop3dp     androidpaddingBottom3dp      androidtextColorcolorgreen     androidellipsizemarquee     androidsingleLinetrue gt ltTextView     androidididdescription     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidtextSize13sp     androidlayoutbelowidtitle      androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue     androidpaddingRight70dpgt ltTextView     androidididdate     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidtextSize13sp     androidlayoutbelowiddescription      androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue     androidpaddingBottom3dpgt  ltTextView     androidididdays     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidtextSize32sp     androidpaddingRight10dp     androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue     androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue     gt ltTextView     androidididlabel     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidtextSize11sp     androidpaddingRight5dp     androidtextDaysnLent     androidlayouttoLeftOfiddays      androidlayoutcenterVerticaltruegt codepre  pp

Negative 48748 pIm making a simple app that makes some calculations. Some of these calculations are rather complex, so it may take a while to get the result.

Negative 48748 pIm having some difficulty getting an codeNSTextViewcode embedded in an codeNSScrollViewcode with a horizontal codeNSRulerViewcode to play well with a rounded corner mask. Ive created a simple test application to localize the issue.p  pFirst, it appears there are basically two ways to get rounded corners on an codeNSScrollViewcode. The first is to use a codeCAShapeLayercode and set its path property to the desired rounded rectangle bezier path. The second is to set a codeCALayercodes codecornerRadiuscode property to the desired value, and then set its codebackgroundColorcode property to any color with a 1.0 alpha such as solid black. Either of these layers can then be used to set the codeNSScrollViewcodes backing layers codemaskcode property, after making it layerbacked via codesetWantsLayercode. Though I get some drawing artifacts when I apply it directly to the codeNSScrollViewcodes backing layer. So instead, I apply the mask to the codeNSScrollViewcodes superviews backing layer. The superview itself is just a simple container view.p  pNow, the problem arises when we show the ruler view and begin interacting with it. The ruler view itself looks great, it has rounded corners because of the mask applied above. However, when I start to add and drag markers, they are invisible until I release the mouse, making it very difficult to position markers. Also, the standard vertical marker lines do not appear while dragging.p  pIve confirmed that this is occurring due to the presence of the mask. When I disable the mask, the codeNSRulerViewcode behaves normally.p  pSo the question is, how can I get codeNSRulerViewcode and codeNSScrollViewcodes rounded corners to play well togetherp  pIt looks almost as if the mask layer is somehow obscuring the temporary drawing thats occurring in the codeNSRulerViewcode during mousedrag tracking. If this is the case, how do I get the codeNSRulerViewcode to perform its drawing above everything else Making it and all other views layerbacked, as well as positioning the codeNSRulerViewcode above all sibling views for good measure doesnt seem to have any effect.p  pIve also tried subclassing codeNSTextViewcode to override the delegate method coderulerViewwillMoveMarkercode and others to force drawing, but it seems to draw the marker in a weird location, near the bottom left of the window, nowhere near the codeNSRulerViewcode, even after ensuring Im in the right coordinate system. I suspect this is a drawing artifact, though, since forcing it to draw elsewhere has no effect.p

Negative 48748 pSo Im in the process of adding links to images on my web site, and Ive come across something interesting. p  pAll the images Im linking to are housed on another domain, but this domain happens to be located on the same server as the site Im working on. Now normally I would download images from the other domain and place them in my websites directory structure, so as to avoid having to connect to another server and thus save on load time when grabbing the images on page load. But in this case, with the two file structures being located on the same server, I wonder if the time to download the images on page load would be virtually the same with absolute linking to the sibling domain versus storing the images on my site itself. p  pDoes anybody know if this is the case Thanks p

Negative 48748 pThere are many online resources that illustrate using Microsoft Internet Explorer Controls within VBA Excel to perform basic IE automation tasks. These work great when the webpage in question has a basic construct. However, when webpages contain multiple frames they can be difficult to work with. Currently I am having issues determining if an individual frame within a webpage has completely loaded. For example... This VBA Excel code opens IE, loads a webpage, loops thur an excel sheet placing data into the webpage fields, executes search, and then returns the IE results data to excel my apologies for omitting the site address. The rub here is that the target webpage contains two framesp  p1 The searchbar.asp frame for search value input and executing searchp  p2 The searchresults.asp frame for displaying search resultsp  pIn this construct the search bar is static, while the search results change according to input criteria. Because the webpage is built in this manner, the IEApp.ReadyState and IEApp.Busy cannot be used to determine IEfr1 frame load completion, as these properties do not change after the initial search.asp load. Therefore, I use a large static wait time to avoid runtime errors as internet traffic flucuates. This code does work, but it is ridiculously slow... note the 10 second wait after the cmdGO statement. I would really like to improve the performance of this process by adding solid logic to determine the frame load progress.p  pMy question is this  Does anyone know of a clever way to determine if an autonomous frame has finished loadingp  pThanks,p  pZp  precode NOTE you must add a VBA project reference to Internet Explorer Controls  in order for this code to work Dim IEapp As Object Dim IEfr0 As Object Dim IEfr1 As Object   Set new IE instance Set IEapp  New InternetExplorer   With IE object With IEapp      Make visible on desktop     .Visible  True      Load target webpage     .Navigate httpwww.MyTargetWebpage.comsearch.asp      Loop until IE finishes loading     While .ReadyState ltgt READYSTATECOMPLETE         DoEvents     Wend End With   Set the searchbar.asp frame0 Set IEfr0  IEapp.Document.frames0.Document    For each row in my worksheet For i  1 To 9999                       Input search values into IEfr0 frame0     IEfr0.getElementByIdSearchVal1.Value  Cellsi, 5     IEfr0.getElementByIdSearchVal2.Value  Cellsi, 6       Execute search     IEfr0.allcmdGo.Click               Wait a fixed 10sec     Application.Wait Now  TimeValue000010       Set the searchresults.asp frame1     Set IEfr1  IEapp.Document.frames1.Document       Retrieve webpage results data     Cellsi, 7  TrimIEfr1.all.Item26.innerText     Cellsi, 8  TrimIEfr1.all.Item35.innerText  Next codepre

Negative 48748 pI have a database with limited external connectionsup to 5. Because of that reason I introduced a server applications which maintains all database operations. That server uses WCF service with callback to inform clients of all changes. Clients store local copy of database in serialized dictionaries. When all works fine then if one client or server perform a change, then all other clientsserver are notified almost instantly. Problem is that sometimes client goes out of sync and only way to repair that is to delete local copy of databasesometimes also on server. I figured out that it happens when some objects are deleted from database. I use datetime with auto update to find changed rows, but this doesnt work well with deleted objects. One table has more than 160000 rows, so comparing them with local copy is...troublesome. So question isp  p1 Can anybody point me for good algorithm for creating and maintaining local copy of databasebetween actual database and server, and between server and clients I cant use replicationp  p2 Better way than serialized dictionaries to store it locally.app takes lots of space when all data is loaded p  pPS. I thought about several solutions without database, but I always came to conclusion that I need that local copy.p

Negative 48748 pWe have an iOS InHouse app distributed OTA with a Distribution Provisioning Profile that, as you may know, expires in 1 year.  We have gone through upgrading the profile and distribution pains last year, so we are familiar with the process of distributing the app with a new profile, but I want to ask some questions just for clarity.  We are currently 29 days away from expiration, so users are getting notifiedp  pLast year we thought that creating a NEW distribution provisioning profile with the same name as the expiring profile would overwrite the expiring profile.  We were incorrect, it does not, and the device wound up with 2 profiles of the same name.  Since you cannot overwrite an old profile, the problem from a maintenance and help desk perspective is that when you distribute the app with the new profile, users hundreds in our case still get notified that The provisioning profile will expire in x days even after theyve upgraded the app that includes a new profile.br As you can imagine, that is confusing to users and frustrating for higher ups in the tech department.  As I understand it, youre left with two ways to deal with having an unneeded expiring provisioning profile on the deviceneither of which is a good user experience.  Eitherp  ol liTell the users to ignore the message that their profile is expiring I believe the expiring profile notification comes at 29 days, 15 days, and every day starting at 7 days...though not positive and have them upgrade the app with the new profile.br orli liOnce the users have upgraded the app with the new profile, have them manually delete the expiring profile in Settings  Profiles.  UGH  li ol  pIs there any workaround for how to remove the expiring profile aside from walking the individual user through the process  Are we missing somethingp  pI dont want to revoke the cert that is contained in the expiring profile because that will present more problems  i.e. app not working for users who dont upgrade.  p  pSimply put, we would just like to have a process that forestalls the expiration alerts so a user never sees them.  p

Negative 48748 pStumbled up one curiosity that i researched upon but found no exact answer whatsoever. I was adding a view to my mvc project when i noticed that when mentioning the model for the view lots of classes appear to wich i have no reference in a direct way. For example i can see in the add view dialog all the ClosedXml classes for excel but that dll is referenced in my Bussines Logic project, not in the web project for sure. So 1. why does it appear in the models dropdown in the add view dialog 2.Should this list not be composed only of classes from the models folder Sorry if this is a silly question but nevertheless no one could give me a straight answer.p

Negative 48748 pIve been messing around with framebuffers and render to texture and I came across the need to blit them. Again on some machines I get a codeGLINVALIDOPERATIONcode right after the codeglBlitFramebuffercode call. Each texture bound to the framebuffer is setup the exact same way, all the same size and parameters. Also, when I try to blit one entire texture previously succesfully rendered to to another framebuffer, only the destination rectangle to write in is smaller than the rectangle to read from e.g. when I want to blit it to a quarter of the screen, it throws a codeGLINVALIDOPERATIONcode too.p  pstrongEDITstrong emActually it always throws the error whenever the rectangles to read from and draw to have a different size, so I cant blit to a texture of a different size, or the same size but a different sized render to area...emp  pEverytime I blit to a manually generated framebuffer the status is checked through codeglCheckFramebufferStatuscode and it always returns codeGLFRAMEBUFFERCOMPLETEcode.p  pemBIGGEST SNIP EVER, see below for shorter source code, obviously a couple C errors and not complete, but its only for the GL callsemp  pThe OpenGL error occurs when I call the last method of the viewport Viewportblit with the screen framebuffer as target by passing NULL. It first sets the read buffer of its own framebuffer the draw buffers were already set and then it calls RenderTargetblit which calls codeglBlitFramebuffercode.

Negative 48748 pI need encrypted information regarding the application users to be sent over to my server. And also for the server to verify the information sent and send back an encrypted response so the client would know what to do depending on the response. I believe I should be approaching this with JSON and POST PHP but dont know what to do for the security aspects of it.p  pAn example would be. Client buys coins through inapp billing. Server receives notice from inapp billing and updates how many coins Client has. Client then proceeds to use coins to buy an item in the game and sends its verification and id to server which the server verifies and then sends a response code either stating that the Client is banned for doing fraudulent activity or insufficient coins or lets the Client buy the item in question.p  pSome questions I have.p  ol lipI understand that any application or game can always be hacked on the clients end but gets progressively harder if its verifying things coinciding a server. How can I make sure that it is very hard for the client to mess with the response code and also with the sending of verification Would SSL be enough If so, could you direct me to an article on how to implement SSL for Android php postingpli lipHow does Google billing verify its users By email or device IDpli ol

Negative 48748 pOverview A basic jqueryui dialog is defined and later opened on demand with injected markup.p  pProblem The first example works, but the second one seemingly similar doesnt. It makes no difference in what order they are opened. Even if I open the nonworking one first, it doesnt work.

All code is working except for the 2nd jqueryui dialog surrounded by asterisks. Ajax returns the correct data, etc. The alert above the 2nd dialog even works, but that dialog never displays with or without the alert in the code.p  pThe 2nd dialog call is inside an ajax callback function.

Negative 48748 pI have a codeContextMenucode as part of a codeTabControlcode such asp  precodeltTabControl NameMyTabControlgt     ltTabControl.ContextMenugt         ltContextMenu NameMyContextMenu IsEnabledFalse StaysOpenTruegt             ltMenuItem HeaderItem1gtltMenuItemgt             ...         ltContextMenugt     ltTabControl.ContextMenugt ltTabControlgt codepre  pAs you can see, the menu is disabled. It will be enabled later in the program, for now however, it should remain in its disabled state. The problem is, when I rightclick the codeTabControlcode and the disabled menu shows, it simply stays where it was first opened, no other rightclick will move it, nor will a leftclick somewhere make it disappear.p  pThe only way to get rid of it, would be either by enabling it and then rightleftclicking, or by using codeMyContextMenu.Visibility  Visibility.CollapsedHiddencodep  pI tried setting the codeStaysOpencodeproperty to codeFalsecode. Then the menu will open once in its disabled state. After leftclicking disappear and then not appear again even if it gets enabled.p  pThe only way around it could be changing the codeStaysOpencodeproperty along with the codeIsEnabledcodeproperty, but it is a bit weird that the menu opens exactly once in its disabled state and then not anymore.p  pI hope anybody could explain to me, why exactly a disabled menu wont close and the property codeStaysOpencode at false makes it open exactly once, because it seems like a weird behaviour to me.p

Negative 48748 pI am in the middle of creating a completely jQuery HTML5 site. The content is all populated by an xml feed. It is all programmatic. Since there arent any static pages theres just an index.php, how does one go about indexing content for search engines What do developers usually do when the site is just dynamically created What if I want for instance to put a tweet this button on each page. How could I get that button to create a URL that would then perhaps trigger a function that shows the correct contentp  pEDITED QUESTIONp  pI am asking this  since, with a dynamic site such as the one I am building, there is only one URL  index.php. Now normally a search engine will crawl through the pages of a website. But this doesnt have any pages  its only dynamic content. There is really nothing for the search engine to crawl. Next, if I click on a link in the site again the link is dynamically created and links to something else dynamically created Say for instance I click on widget 1 and it takes me to that products description page. I have no way of sending that description page URL because it doesnt have one. So how would you address this issue In a php situation also dynamic you would put the query string in the url. But this is all Jquery  everything is imported into the index.php. Does that make sensep

Negative 48748 pHello and thanks in advance for any suggestions. I am using the grouping option in the Kendo UI and i wanted to change the default grouping message Drag a column header and drop it here to ... So i changed the text in 3 .js files called kendo.all.min.js, kendo.web.min.js, and kendo.groupable.min.js, to the desired text and the text does not change. I think im missing something because when i group and ungroup i see my message for a sec but then the grid reloads again and i get the original message again. Is the message coming from the dll or just from java script hope someone can help it is really important. Thanks.p
Negative 48748 pI know that I can use JMS and ActiveMQ, but I really need something very simple and without a lot of overhead. I did some test with ActiveMQ and didnt really liked a performance of persistence queues.p  pWhat Im looking for is basic implementation of any blocking queue with ability to store message on HDD ideally if some size limit is reached. Then it should be able to read stored message from HDD and if possible stop writing new to HDD restore in memory use.p  pMy scenario is very simple  messages json are coming from outside world. I do some processing and then send them to another REST service. Problem can occur when target REST service is down or network between us is bad. In this case ready to go events are stored in queue that can potentially fill up all available memory. I dont wantneed to write every message to HDDDB  only those that cant fit into memory.p  pThank youp

Negative 48748 pIm trying to get a fresh installation of Django 1.5 running on an ApacheServer. The WebServer is situated on a shared hosting platform called uberspace.de which means I have no access to the Apache configuration itself I can however write .htaccess files if thats any help at all.

Negative 48748 pI am using Spring MVC for my presentation layer, and am also using Spring for my Service and DAO layers.  Normally I would format data in the View layer of MVC in my case JSPs, but what if the data that is retrieved from the database is not in a standardized format  p  pFor instance, I am pulling phone numbers from one of my companys databases, but they could potentially be in any format 1115551234 or 1115551234, etc. This seems like it would be too much functionality and processing to place in the JSPView layer. I would prefer to put all of the numbers in the same format somewhere else and then reformat on the View.  Where should I format in this situation  Service layer DAOp  pThis would also allow me to take advantage of libraries that I could not potentially call from a JSP or that would not make sense to call from a JSP.p  pThanksp

Negative 48748 pI want to do localization between web application and silverlight application.

Negative 48748 pI am facing a weird issue related to erasing elements in a STL list while iterating it. I am aware of the fact that erasing an element invalidates the iterator.

For example, [2  1 4  3 5] is an even permutation of the identity permutation [1 2 3 4 5] because it requires an even number of swaps to get from one vector to the other.  This seems like the kind of thing that people might want to do often and that there might be a builtin function for.  People have posted quite long Matlab files on the Web to accomplish this.  If I could get Matlab to give me a permutation emmatrixem, then I could take the determinant of that matrix, but I havent figured out how to do that, nor do I know if theres a quick way. p

Negative 48748 pIm using Eigen 3.1.2 and I am able to build a 64bit target of my application without any problems. When I build a 32bit target, I got a lot of unaligned asserts. So I followed the a hrefhttpeigen.tuxfamily.orgdoxgroupDenseMatrixManipulationAlignement.html relnofollowworkarounda by defining EIGENMAKEALIGNEDOPERATORNEW in all my classes, and using Eigenalignedallocator for all the STL containers. This seems to have taken care of all the asserts. However, in debug mode, I crash at a certain point. Here is where it crashesp  pmcontainer.resizeNp  pThis is a resize operation on mcontainer which is a codestdvectorltstdvectorltstdvectorltpFOOgt gt gtcode a 3D array of pFOO, where pFOO is a pointer to a FOO object. Im defining the pointer using a codepFOO  stdsharedptrltFOOgtcode. Also, class FOO has a few Eigen members and Ive defined a public EIGENMAKEALIGNEDOPERATORNEW in the class. Will codestdsharedptrltFOOgtcode use the aligned allocator by default Any reason why it would crash at the resize operation  What else could I try p  pEDIT The workarounds suggested in the Eigen documentation state that for STL containers of classes containing Eigen members, I must use the Eigenalignedallocator as an additional parameter to the stdvector declaration. In my case, I have an stdvector of empointersem to the class containing Eigen members. I am relying on the EIGENMAKEALIGNEDOPERATORNEW to do the aligned allocation and am not using the Eigenalignedallocator in the stdvector declaration.p

Negative 48748 pI am new to the hashing in general and also to the STL world and saw the new a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferenceunorderedsetunorderedset relnofollowstdunrderedseta and the SGI hashset,both of which uses the a hrefhttpwww.sgi.comtechstlhash.html relnofollowhasher hasha. I understand to get a good load factor , you might need to write your own hashfunction, and I have been able to write one.p  pHowever, I am trying to go deep into , how the original default hasfunctions are written.  My question is  1 How is the original default HashFcn written  more concretely how is the hash generated Is it based on some pseudo random number. Can anyone point me to some header file I am a bit lost with the documentation, where I can look up  how the hasher hash is implemented. p  p2How does it guarantee that each time , you will be able to get the same keyp  pPlease, let me know if I can make my questions clearer any wayp

Negative 48748 pI apologize if my code is messy, as I am very new to Java and have also been editing out parts of my code to see if I can make it work. I have an assignment in which I have to generate code100code random integers in between code0code and code25code and store them in an array. Then, I have to create another method that sorts out the even integers into a separate array, then do this with the odds in another method.p  pMy problem is, no matter how hard I try, I cannot manage to get my even sorting method to recognize the original array with the code100code random integers. The command prompt says it requires codeint[]code but found int. I even tried making the sortEvens method require an integer instead of an array and the prompt said the exact opposite.

If I putp  precodetable .pricing tr tdlastchild  textalign right  codepre  porp  precode.pricing table tr tdlastchild  textalign right  codepre  pThen this line doesnt work. However, if I putp  precodetable.pricing tr tdlastchild  textalign right  codepre  pThen it does work.p  pWhat makes it even more confusing, is that Im editing the CSS of a theme, and it has these linesp  precodetable caption  fontweight bold textalign left padding 4px 6px border 1px solid ddd borderbottom 0 background ffd53c urlimgpattern.png   table th, table td  paddingleft 6px paddingright 6px lineheight 21px border 1px solid ddd backgroundcolor fff textalign left verticalalign middle   table th, table tfoot td  fontweight bold background eee urlimgpattern.png   table tfoot a  textdecoration none   table .alternate td  backgroundcolor fafafa   table.large th,table.large td  padding 12px 8px  codepre  pI just want to figure out a rule, when to put table, when not to put table, whether I have to write tr td or just td, where do I put the class selector before everything, in the middle, with or without table, etc.p

Negative 48748 pI am writing an agnostic viewer for a collection of systems that Im working with. This viewer will show me the generic structure of my data without needing to know the context of the specific system.p  pIm trying to deserialise a memory stream which contains only a type codeFooltTgtcode where codeFooltTgtcode inherits from codeFoocode. From the agnostic viewers point of view, all the data that I require is in Foo. The codeltTgtcode part is irrelevant.p  pType T is defined in another assemblys. Under normal operation, the system obviously has all appropriate contextual assemblies loaded. The problem is that when running the viewer, none of the contextual assemblies are loaded. when I attempt to deserialise the instance of Foo, I obviously get an exception because the referenced assembly is not loaded. p  pIm trying to detect whether or not I have all required referenced assemblies loaded and thus know whether to try to deserialise the data, or reconstruct the data that I require from other aspects of the class.p  pI know I can do this using a very simple exception try catch block, but, this is not an exception case. I IknowI this is going to happen hundreds, if not thousands of times when I load my data, and this could cause me a nightmare, as I like to have break on exception turned on. I also subscribe to the school of thought that says Exception  the hint is in the name and thus Exceptions should not form part of your primary case code.p  pedit 21102013p  psee a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsina3g0r2y08sgsqTemplatedSerialisationProblem.rar relnofollowherea for a full illustrative example, but here are the important bitsp  pFoo class, defined in commonp  precode[Serializable] public class Foo      public string Agnostic  get set    [Serializable] public class FooltTgt  Foo      public string Contextual  get set   codepre  pContextual saving p  precodeBinaryFormatter bf  new BinaryFormatter FileInfo tempFile  TempFileGetter.GetTempFile   FooltBargt fooBar  new FooltBargt fooBar.Agnostic  Agnostic fooBar.Contextual  Contextual   using var fs  tempFile.OpenWrite     bf.Serializefs, fooBar    fs.Flush  codepre  pAgnostic loadingp  precodeBinaryFormatter bf  new BinaryFormatter FileInfo tempFile  TempFileGetter.GetTempFile  using var fs  tempFile.OpenRead     Foo foo  Foobf.Deserializefs    Controls.DataContext  foo  codepre  pI mean, there is nothing rocket science in this code, and, if the agnostic viewer loads the context viewer as a reference, then it loads fine, but, I dont want to do this, as we wont always have the the contextual libraries to load.p

Negative 48748 pBy guarantee I mean the commonly understood feature of TCP that if a packet gets damaged or lost, then it will go unacknowledged and be resent.p  pConsider the situation in java where the sender sends some data, and immediately closes the socket. If that data goes missing or corrupts itself enroute, will the reciever never be able to get it Or does the senders socket wait and not actually close until all of the appropriate ACKs have been read back inp  pIve tried tracing the socket.close method back myself, but its hard as not only are there are many internal socket implementations but the functionality splits down several paths with ambiguous method names.p
Negative 48748 pI have been looking into using database transactions in the environment I am currently programming in C.Net WebPages with WebMatrix, using SQL Server CE, and have read up a lot on the topic.p  pAt first, I was looking into this because I felt it was 100 necessary for my project, although, now I realize that the default Lastinwins concurrency policy will work fine for my somewhat simple CRUD system.p  pNow, I dont have enough knowledge about this to really say that I, 100, need this, but I would like to, if possible, converge all of the statements I would otherwise have to hit the database several times for, into one statement, so as to minimize the number of times the database has to be locked again, Im not sure if this is worth worrying over, but it just feels like a single statement would cleaner, more efficient, and possibly even less errorprone.p  pIn my serverside code, I have some logical branches that, depending on whether ID numbers can be reused or not, needs to perform an codeINSERT INTOcode or an codeUPDATEcode statement to the database for each row that I need to add. Problem is there is no way, other than transactions, to combine multiple codeUPDATEcode andor codeINSERTcode statements into one communicable statement.p  pLastly, in reviewing transaction syntax for my environment myself, I came across many pages that describe how transactions work, but provide no syntactical examples thereof. I did find this page...p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.data.sqlserverce.sqlcecommand.transactionvvs.100.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.data.sqlserverce.sqlcecommand.transactionvvs.100.aspxap  p...that actually targets my environment and serverside code, exactly, however, the syntax used does not show up with Intellisence as Im typing, which has always been a telltale sign that the syntax is wrong. In this page, though, I can easily see how logically I should set this up using try, catch, and even finally, and that makes perfect sense to me. My problem is that I cant find any syntax for my given environment on how to actually compile a transaction.p  pIs there anyone who could possibly provide an example for the syntax needed to compile a database transaction with multiple codeINSERTcode and codeUPDATEcode statements, within my C.Net WebPages with WebMatrix, using SQL Server CE, environmentp
Negative 48748 pSo I am trying to retrieve some data over a socket from an old game which communicates using XML. When a message from the game comes down the line it reads something like thisp  precodeltxml version1.0gtltmessagegtlttypegtSERVERlttypegtltusergtTestDeleteOrKillMeltusergtltcmdgtPRIVATEMSGltcmdgtlthostgt65.255.81.81lthostgtltmsggt57ltmsggtltmessagegt codepre  pHowever, what you cannot see here because this post will not display the characters is that after the number 57 in the msg tags there are two 0x10 characters, displayed as empty boxes. These boxes have the purpose of delineating parameters sent to and from the server. For example the number 57 cooresponds to a message code which contains variables then after the 0x10 there the contents of the variables are sent. p  pMy problem is that using XmlSerialize to serialize the bytes pulled from the buffer yields me an invalid character related error, namelyp  precode , hexadecimal value 0x10, is an invalid character. Line 1, position 135. codepre  pThe question is how can I get around this Is there a way to configure the Serializer to accept this character or some hack to make this workp
Negative 48748 pI am trying to achieve a simple reflected sprite effect. Imagine a diagonal line which goes from one corner of the screen to the other. Then, a sprite or image is rotated by a particular amount and placed at some location on one side of the diagonal. What would be the mathematical formula to programmatically rotate another instance of the sprite or image that will be placed on the reflected side of the screen  Its easy for me to figure out if the reflection is vertical or horizontal a simple flip of the image and I can figure out where to place the resulting sprite, but it seems like a whole different level of complexity trying to determine the resultant sprites angle.p  pAny suggestions or programming formulas I generally stink at trigonometry and cant find any leads.  Again, the angle of the line of reflection is known or can be found as can the angle of the original sprite. I just want to determine how the reflected sprite will be rotated when displayed.p

Negative 48748 pI want to know if using PHPmailer functions to send HTML or plain emails would be not considered as SPAM by mail servers if it would originate from the domain with the same name.p  pFor example p  ul lisending email with PHPmailer as infomydomain.com originating from mydomain.com domain as opposed to say GMail server or other mail servers.li ul  pI have a password lost system that sends emails to people using my websiteportal and so far i tested the function with my GMail account. I wonder that when I will move to new hosting, linux box, and configure the domain on that box, and add a mail account and use PHPMailer locally, with that mail account, maybe it would be totally cleaner and will not go in SPAM folders when I sent mails.p  pLet me know your thoughts about it, and if this really worksp  pthanks,p
Negative 48748 pIm looking for way make the RollingFlatFileTraceListenerData create a valid JSON document when using JsonLogFormatter. Like the XML parser, the RollingFlatFileTraceListenerData only appends items, just giving you an option to add an item header and footer, but not a higher level file header, footer header and item separator. I realize I can modify the file after the fact, but I would rather have the process build with a valid format. Opening the active file with an external process would be risky because it could block the logging process if it needed to open the file to log again. p  pstrongCurrent Outputstrongp  precode   Message Log entry created using the simplest overload.,   Categories [     General   ],   Priority 1,   EventId 1,   Severity 8,   LoggedSeverity Information,   Title ,   TimeStamp 20131107T203338.6537773Z,   MachineName Acme01,   AppDomainName Acme.TestDriver.vshost.exe,   ProcessId 10348,   ProcessName CdevAcme.TestDriverbinDebugAcme.TestDriver.vshost.exe,   ManagedThreadName null,   Win32ThreadId 11204,   ExtendedProperties ,   TimeStampString 1172013 83338 PM,   ActivityId 00000000000000000000000000000000,   RelatedActivityId null,   ErrorMessages null,   ActivityIdString 00000000000000000000000000000000,   CategoriesStrings [     General   ]     Message Log entry with a single category.,   Categories [     General   ],   Priority 1,   EventId 1,   Severity 8,   LoggedSeverity Information,   Title ,   TimeStamp 20131107T203338.6537773Z,   MachineName Acme01,   AppDomainName Acme.TestDriver.vshost.exe,   ProcessId 10348,   ProcessName CdevAcme.TestDriverbinDebugAcme.TestDriver.vshost.exe,   ManagedThreadName null,   Win32ThreadId 11204,   ExtendedProperties ,   TimeStampString 1172013 83338 PM,   ActivityId 00000000000000000000000000000000,   RelatedActivityId null,   ErrorMessages null,   ActivityIdString 00000000000000000000000000000000,   CategoriesStrings [     General   ]  codepre  pstrongPreferredstrongp  precode[         Message Log entry created using the simplest overload.,       Categories [         General       ],       Priority 1,       EventId 1,       Severity 8,       LoggedSeverity Information,       Title ,       TimeStamp 20131107T203338.6537773Z,       MachineName Acme01,       AppDomainName Acme.TestDriver.vshost.exe,       ProcessId 10348,       ProcessName CdevAcme.TestDriverbinDebugAcme.TestDriver.vshost.exe,       ManagedThreadName null,       Win32ThreadId 11204,       ExtendedProperties ,       TimeStampString 1172013 83338 PM,       ActivityId 00000000000000000000000000000000,       RelatedActivityId null,       ErrorMessages null,       ActivityIdString 00000000000000000000000000000000,       CategoriesStrings [         General       ]      ,            Message Log entry with a single category.,       Categories [         General       ],       Priority 1,       EventId 1,       Severity 8,       LoggedSeverity Information,       Title ,       TimeStamp 20131107T203338.6537773Z,       MachineName Acme01,       AppDomainName Acme.TestDriver.vshost.exe,       ProcessId 10348,       ProcessName CdevAcme.TestDriverbinDebugAcme.TestDriver.vshost.exe,       ManagedThreadName null,       Win32ThreadId 11204,       ExtendedProperties ,       TimeStampString 1172013 83338 PM,       ActivityId 00000000000000000000000000000000,       RelatedActivityId null,       ErrorMessages null,       ActivityIdString 00000000000000000000000000000000,       CategoriesStrings [         General       ]      ] codepre

Negative 48748 pIm having trouble wrapping my thoughts about class inheritance. Im suppsed to create a dashboard like interface in a app, and Ill have maybe 10 widgetsdashlets on that dashboard view. All those dashletswidgets will have basically same look, with a title on the top, borders, row of buttons on the top and a graph. Lets say I create a subclass of UI View called Dashlet with properties and outlets, and create XIB file with proper layout and connected outlets etc.p  pNow I want to create several subclasses of that Dashlet view that will only process data differently, and draw different graphs.

Whenever i try to do something like this in CustomDashlet.mp  pcode[self someDummyMethod]code or even code[self testMethod]code I get an exception error like thisp  precodeNSInvalidArgumentException, reason [Dashlet testMethod] unrecognized selector sent to instance  codepre  pAm I even doing this right Did I miss something Am I supposed to make this work in some other way If anyone has  suggestions, please feel free to share your thoughts, thank you for all the help.p

Negative 48748 pSo I have written a bash script within AtlassianStash for postreceive events. In this script, after a commit has been made, it creates a codecollaborator code review. To create a code review, it needs commit title, commit user and git SHA for any changes and uploading the changes to the code review. To get these informations, I cloned the directory to depth1 even without depth1 and work with git log options. p  pThe problem I am seeing is that if I run the script manually, it works just fine. However, if it runs after a commit has been made, it errors out after it clones the directory saying it is not a git directory. If I cd into the directory after the script exits, I am able to run git log and other git commands.  p  pThings I tried to troubleshoot are  1. Permissions issues running it as root, so I am not seeing any permissions issues. 2. troubleshooting it with bash xv and until that point everything looks good. 3.

Negative 48748 pI have an already developed application on Linux which would benefit from one process with more RAM than it would by offloading individual processes onto smaller compute nodes with less RAM. So this is the one option Im researching here.p  pId like to run one process on the master node and yet somehow make all the available RAM on all compute nodes appear as one large block of available RAM to the master node as if a single system. p  pAs far as I know, this use of a Single System Image SSI is now called Distributed Shared Memory DSM. Ive been looking into single system images but cant tell which ones support this.p  pDoes anyone know which of the open source SSI packages would accomplish this I was also wondering about OpenSSI, though the lists are very inactive.p  pEditbr In my use of DSM, I was thinking in the context of having physically separate address spaces on different compute nodes, and being able to access them as if they were one logical shared address space available to a single process on a single node, the head node. I used the term SSI and incorrectly in this context because I was wanting the system to appear as one single system from the users perspective. My current use of SSI, is a file system in which all diskless nodes boot from a single image in a specific location on the master node. p  pI understand the memory of multiple nodes is accomplished by means of a comm lib which is currently in use, but I need more RAM. So in researching SSI packages that seem to mention the ability to support a Single IPC Space, I was thinking this emmightem be something useful. I had read several white papers where the memory management of nodes could be handled at the OS level and therefore I wouldnt need the communication libary as this would be abstracted below userspace.p  pId like to not modify the code as it would already take advantage of large amounts of RAM if it were already available on the localhost. And I do have large amounts of RAM, except that RAM is distributed on different nodes and therefore does require the use of some MPI type libraries. Modifying the code is costly, adding more RAM requires a new cluster, costly. However, a solution that would give my application the illusion of a very large single address space ... I can only hope.p

Negative 48748 pI have a Mac computer. Usually all my batch programming is done on my PC. So I tried to create what I assumed would be a simple equivalent using a Mac shell.

Here is my custom onclicklistener class p  precode    DishCategoryButtonListener implements OnClickListener              private final int position          private DishCategoryButtonListenerint position              this.position  position                   public void onClickView v                        System.out.printlnThe position is   position              button.setTextColorColor.BLACK             button.setBackgroundColorColor.GREEN          codepre  pThe issue I would run into is that whenever I selected a button on the screen. It would show me the correct position, but for some reason it does not change color to green and black if it was selected. I want it to be green if selected and black if it is not. Is there a way I could do this Would I have to implement the onclick listener in the main class or would I have to use this custom listenerp  pemEDITemI just tried that and instead what I have seen is a pattern. Lets say the list contains about 20 objects in the array list. This then creates 20 buttons in a 1 column gridview. What seems to be happening is that whenever on of them is clicked, it actually changes the color of the button at the bottom of screen. If I scroll down, it changes the color of that button at the bottom of the screen.p

Negative 48748 pI am making a a JavaFX GUI application, which uses the javafx webview class. Now i am able to show a webpage in Java. Now i want to make the webpage  respond to different touch events. I am pretty sure i have to customise it for different kinds of events,Like stationary move and remove would act like a click, whereas a drag would be scroll. Actually i am not exactly using a touchscreen but something similar. So if there might also be a way to pass the coordinates to touch event explicityly or maybe making a user defined event handler and than using it, and then somehow using it inside the webview.p  pI am a bit new to JavaFX and a bit of event handling so would like some direction.p  pIs there a way to pass psuedotouch events p  pI am using a hrefhttpwww.tuio.org relnofollowTUIOa, and I am able to recieve the coordinates etc correctly. I have TUIO event functions responding in their way. Can i pass custom events or change them to touch screen events and pass them to webview Because they are not actually touch events but if someone can be made pseudotouch events acting like them, that might work.p

Negative 48748 pI have been playing around with the cmd python module and was looking at the text completion function. I have been trying to get it to expandrecognise  to my home directory but with no avail.p  pIve noticed that I can handle default completion by overriding the codecompletedefaultself, ignoredcode method from the cmd module. Where codeignoredcode is a tuple of the text, line, begidx, endidx. If I type in the command codemycommand .foldercode the codetextcode parameter will be .folder and this mean I can do something like codeglob.globtext  code which returns a list of all the files in that folder. However, if I now do codemycommand foldercode the codetextcode variable now only contains codefoldercode, so I am unable to use codeos.path.expandusertextcode to determine the absolute path of that folder and show all the files in that folder.p  pBasically I am wondering if someone could point me in the right direction in order to expand  paths with a codecode in it.  p

Negative 48748 pWhat is the difference between using belongsToMany or hasManyThrough when defining a Many To Many relationship in Laravelp  pExample codeUsercode codeAccountcode codeAccountUsercodep  pSo, User has a many to many relation to Account via the AccountUser table. On top of being just the pivot table that defines the related Users with related Accounts, it also stores a codeAccountUser.rolecode field, which determines which role a given user has in a given account.p  pWhat would the implications be of using either codeUser belongsToMany Accountcode or codeUser hasManyThrough Account AccountUsercode Or is this essentially the samep  pWhen decided upon a method, I guess I should use the same method for the reverse relation definition.p

Negative 48748 pI am trying to find documentation that details how to import Other Payroll Items data to Quickbooks Payroll. I would like to import quantities for nontaxable items such as mileage and lodging. So far, I have not been able to find any information on these processes. My target is Quickbooks Desktop with the Web Connector. Does anyone have experience with this and could give me a few pointers, maybe just a place in the SDK documentation I should be using to get started Third party tools would also be acceptable, but I would like to provide the connection from our web app to QB desktop. Thank youp

Negative 48748 pThere is some long processing that need to be completed, so I put it in a service. The activity must be able to connect to the service, show the user current results from the service. So I start the service with start Service and later call bind Service with BINDAUTOCREATE as in LocalService from a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappService.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappService.htmlastrongServiceLifecyclestrong. I want it to run until its job is done, and then self stop, even if client is still connected to it. or determine the client to unbind Is any way to do it with the sample LocalService p  pI was considering passing a handler to the service so that it can send messages back to the activity, but I dont want the activity to get leaked. I am just getting used with services, so maybe I am misusing something.p  pEDIT The workload consists of several threads, synchronized and run in parallel, so I guess is not a good candidate for intent service. Some data analysis is done in background service, and when the user restarts the activity that started the service, it should display some graphics according to current values computed by background service. All background processing is triggered at the beginning, and need only inspection later on, when activity connects to it. Android should not be able to stop the service. When the job is finished, the service should be able to terminate even if the activity is connected to it.p

Negative 48748 pI have a VB procedure that changes a connection string for all 360 linked tables in my Access 2002 database. If I run this procedure using an SQL server in my local network, it runs about 30 seconds. The problem is that I have to use an SQL server somewhere in the Internet. In this case the procedure runs for about 5 minutes.  The question is  how can I prevent Access from connecting to the server to check every table I reconnect p  pAn alternative question maybe more correct. I need to run that reconnection procedure on every users computer every time I give them a new version of the database, to save users login and password into every linked table.

Negative 48748 h2UPDATE After some very insightful code from Marc Kline, I went back and cleaned up my page. It turned out that I had my controllers listed in reversed My angular controller was inside the Isotope controller, instead of the other way round. Once I changed it back and cleaned off some additional scripting, it started working again. I have updated the code snippet to reflect the change. Thanks to Marc and S.Oh2  pI am having trouble figuring out how can I add new items using Angular and still let Isotope manage their UI display.p  pI am using Isotope and Angular to render server results in a masonry style layout. When I add new items to the layout on a button click, angular adds it just fine. However, they do not appear in the context of the isotope UI and appear separately and cannot be sorted, laid out or filtered using Isotope.p  pHere is my JS Codep  precode    lt Define controller gt     var contrl  app.controllerMainController, functionscope         scope.items lstXYZ JSON data from server  Function called by button click         scope.addItem  functionitem                    scope.items.pushitem           scope.item                      contrl.inject  [scope] codepre  pHere is the HTML to display the server results...Updated to show working code..refer commentsp  precodeltdiv ngcontrollerMainControllergt  ltdiv classisotope idisotopeContainergt       ltdiv ngrepeatitem in itemsgt                 ltdiv classelementitem item.status datacategoryitem.statusgt           ltp classnumbergtitem.typeltpgt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt codepre  pAnd here is my HTML button to add the new itemsp  precode  lttablegt     lttrgt       lttdgtltinput typetext ngmodelitem.status gtlttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt       lttdgtltinput typetext ngmodelitem.type gtlttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt       lttd colspan2gtltinput typeButton valueAdd ngclickaddItemitem gt lttdgt     lttrgt   lttablegt codepre  pI am not sure how do I ensure that Isotope can recognize the newly added element and reanimate the layout.p  pAny help or pointers will be very appreciated.

On the other hand famo.us, despite being allegedly blazingly fast, due to its nonstructured HTML, and usage of CSS transforms for positioning of content, has quite a high learning curve, and the skills I pick up when learning the framework wont benefit me anywhere else, since they are both specific to and dependant on famo.us. The massive speed boost Ill be getting probably outweighs those downsides though.p  pCould someone provide any insight based on those requirements Im struggling to make a decision on what I should invest my time in.p

Negative 48748 pBig hello to all good people. I am learning ASP and have one problem that I cannot solve. Here is what bother me p  pI have one gridView that list all customers with all their info city, address, phone etc. My idea was to add one dropDownList with all citys in it and than when you chose some city in gridView would be displayed only customers from that city. I connected everything but now I can see only customers that have city same as first item in dropDownList select  from [someTable] where CityCity. And finally, here is question Is there any way that I can insert first item that would be selected and value of that item to be something like select all below. When that first item is selected, it should allow me to see customers from all citys. Is there any simple solutionp

My first step was to use vanilla Javascript to iterate through all the codeplacescode and pull out all the stronguniquestrong state and country, etc. names and create a filter object with the following codep  precodevar states  [] model.forEachfunctionplace      var state  place.state     var stateExists  states.somefunctionelement          return element.name  state          ifstateExists ampamp state ampamp country          states.pushname state       codepre  pThe code was running extremely slow, so I switched to underscore.jsp  precodevar states  .chainmodel         .uniqfalse, functionvalue return value.state         .sortByfunctionvalue return value.state         .filterfunctionvalue return value.state         .mapfunctionvalue, key             return name value.state                  .value codepre  pHowever, the code is still slow, and I prefer not have to many dependencies in my code. Additionally, Im already using Ember.js for this project, but I cant figure out the Ember way of doing this if it exists. Any suggestions  techniques to do this more efficientlyp

Negative 48748 pI use a NSCollectionView as a toolbox like in Xcodes Interface Builder. When dragging a tool out of the collection view I would like to change the dragging image under the mouse cursor into the real tool image.

Negative 48748 pI am new to zmq and network programming. I want to use pyzmq library to write a simple function to sendreceive data between client and server using REQREP pattern. What I did for sending the data was the followingp  precodedef senddatasocket, data     try         socket.senddata     except         return False     return True codepre  pIf the data is successfully sent to the server, the function will return True, if it is not sent to the server, the function will return False. I know above code is too naive.p  pI dont know how to test the cases when it fail to send the data to the server. One way I can think of is to setup the timeout for sending the data, and send the data to a wrong port.  To be more specific, I bind the client socket to port 5555 and I bind the server socket to port 5556. If I send the data, the above function will still return True, and the client program will stuck there forever, because no server is on that port. How can I set the timeout and catch the error Thus,if there is no responding from the server during a given time, the above function will return False, and so I can do something else if the function return False.p  pUpdatethe rest of my codep  precodedef createsocketport, flag,ipaddr127.0.0.1  setup socket and portaddress binding     context  zmq.Context     if flag  0      server socket         socket  context.socketzmq.REP         socket.bindtcps port     else              client socket         socket  context.socketzmq.REQ           socket.connecttcpss ipaddr,port       return socket,port,context  def recvresponsesocket     message  socket.recv     return message codepre  pMy purpose is the client side send a signal string init to the server to request data. Then the server will correspond, and send some data back to client. The server is always listening. But, its also possible that the server send data to client without the request of client as long as the client is in the list machine of the server. Maybe there are better pattern than REQREP, I plan to try this pattern first as practice.  p  pI want to make sure that the data is sent correctly. But when I read zmq website. It said zmq can ensure either receive the message in a whole piece or do not receive the message at  all. My understanding is I dont need to worry about check the length of received data or use checksum to ensure the data is received correctly, because zmq will do this job for me. I only need to know whether the data is received or not. Is that correctp

Negative 48748 pI developed a game for android with the google play services realtime multiplayer feature. I currently have a problem when matching the players. I dont use any invite feature, so all players just use the automatch functionality.p  pMy game can be played with 4 players, but games with just 3 or 2 players are also possible. For my testing with 2 devices i usep  precodeRoomConfig.createAutoMatchCriteriaminNumberOfOpponents, maxNumberOfOpponents, 0 codepre  pIf i keep starting, ending and restarting games for a number of times, it often happens that the clients are not connected correctly. In the working cases the games onRoomConnected is called correctly and the game starts. In some cases tho, this is not happening. In theses cases, one device finds the other device and its onPeerJoined and onRoomConnecting callback is called. onRoomConnected is never called tho. Thats because the other device gets no information whatsoever, just the roomCreated callback is called, and thats it.p  pSo one device finds the other, and gets the information that another device joined the room. It also gets informed when this device leaves the room again. But the other device doesnt recognize any of this.p  pIf this helps. i had some issues with losing connection before, and fixed it by restarting the apiClient everytime a room left on any clint. I dont think this is related tho.p  pI thought that might be a problem with leaving the current room correctly, and somehow joining the old room again, but it also happens ehen starting the app for the first time. Also the apiClient reconnect should avoid this problemp  pThx in advancep  pEdit It seems like its just my nexus 5 which produces the error. Every other device i tested works fine. The Nexus 5 does too in most cases. If the clients get connected and the game starts, there has never been any problem. The errrr just happens on this one device, and only in maybe 5 out of 6 cases, when searching an online game.p  pIt just stops getting any callbacks called, sometimes right after the onRoomCreated, sometime after he found another peer and onRoomConnecting, and sometimes after onRoomConnected has been called.p  pThe other device gets its appropiate callbacks called tho in these cases.p  ul lipSo if the error device stops at onRoomCreated the other device finds the client.pli lipIf the error device finds the other device and gets onRoomConnecting called and stops after, the other device gets its onRoomConnected.pli lipAnd if the error device gets its onRoomConnected called, it sometimes even stops getting any messages from there on, while the other device is already in the game.pli ul

Negative 48748 pIm trying to summarize weekly earnings for a time management system PHPMySQL, but having a lot of trouble with this SQL query. Basically, I need to return sums of earnings for the past 8 weeks including records for weeks with no earnings, but I cant make this work when I add anything into the WHERE clause to narrow it down to specific kinds of tasks. There are three tables involved in this queryp  ptbltask stores information about tasks, including the date the task is logged, which user did it, how much time should be billed for, and whether the task is billable or not some are not billable and should be excluded from the earnings calculation...p  precodetaskid   taskname        timeest   billable   datelogged   userid  223       some task        120        0          20141219    1 224       a billable task  45         1          20141219    2 225       also billable    90         1          20141220    1 codepre  ptbluser stores user information, so i need to join with it to get the payrate per hour...p  precodeuserid   payrate     1         50 2         75           codepre  pcalendar is just a table with a wide range of dates so that I can join with it and produce results for dates with no records.p  precodedatefield   20130101 20130102 20130103 [...] 20251231 codepre  pBelow is what I have so far, to give me a total of everyones earnings by week starting on a Monday for the 8 weeks prior to the date in question. This seems to work as expected, but counts all tasks instead of just billable tasks. If there are no tasks logged for any of these weeks, I get records returned with 0 as totalearned, which is important because I need records for the past 8 weeks even if no time is logged.p  precodeSELECT FROMDAYSTODAYSdatefield  MODTODAYSdatefield2, 7 AS firstday,  SUM IFNULL timeest 60  payrate, 0   AS totalearned FROM calendar LEFT JOIN tbltask ON tbltask.datelogged  calendar.datefield LEFT JOIN tbluser ON tbltask.userid  tbluser .userid WHERE datefield lt  20141226 GROUP BY FROMDAYSTODAYSdatefield  MODTODAYSdatefield2, 7  ORDER BY FROMDAYSTODAYSdatefield  MODTODAYSdatefield2, 7 DESC  LIMIT 8 codepre  pBUT, I need to only add up earnings for tasks that are billable billable1. As soon as I add this in, I no longer get weeks with no logs, so there are weeks missing from the records returned.p  precodeSELECT FROMDAYSTODAYSdatefield  MODTODAYSdatefield2, 7 AS firstday,  SUM IFNULL timeest 60  payrate, 0   AS totalearned FROM calendar LEFT JOIN tbltask ON tbltask.datelogged  calendar.datefield LEFT JOIN tbluser ON tbltask.userid  tbluser .userid WHERE datefield lt  20141226 AND billable  1  GROUP BY FROMDAYSTODAYSdatefield  MODTODAYSdatefield2, 7  ORDER BY FROMDAYSTODAYSdatefield  MODTODAYSdatefield2, 7 DESC  LIMIT 8 codepre  pI understand why this result makes sense because there are no billable1 tasks completed in those weeks, so no record is returned, but I cant for the life of me figure out how to rewrite the query to get what I want. I would also like to write queries that get the earnings for a particular user instead of all users totalled userid1 but of course that gives me the same problem. I think I might need to use a subqueryp  pCan anyone point me in the right directionp  hr  pSOLUTIONp  pIn case anyone else ends up struggling with something similar, I used terarys suggestion of IF to move the billable1 and userid1 logic inside the SUM calculation, instead of putting it in the WHERE clause. This solved my problem because it returns all the empty weeks with a 0 for total earnings instead of skipping those weeks without records. Im sure there are other ways to do this, but this does work. Heres the resulting queryp  precodeSELECT FROMDAYSTODAYSdatefield  MODTODAYSdatefield2, 7 AS firstday,  SUMIFbillable1 AND userid1, timeest 60  payrate, 0 AS totalearned FROM calendar LEFT JOIN tbltask ON tbltask.datelogged  calendar.datefield LEFT JOIN tbluser ON tbltask.userid  tbluser .userid WHERE datefield lt  20141226 AND billable  1  GROUP BY FROMDAYSTODAYSdatefield  MODTODAYSdatefield2, 7  ORDER BY FROMDAYSTODAYSdatefield  MODTODAYSdatefield2, 7 DESC  LIMIT 8 codepre

Negative 48748 pIm confused the interpretation of codeprintfcodes return value and buffered stream in Standard C Library. p  pIn a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg14wwwdocsn1256.pdf relnofollowC99TC3 Standarda, 7.19.6.3p3 defines that codeprintfcode function returns nonnegative number of characters emtransmittedem in success. Also, 7.19.3p3 describes the behaviors of fullyline buffered stream with emtransmittedem to or from the host environment, and p7 says codestdoutcode can be fully buffered stream.p  pQuote section 7.19.3 with emphasis addedp  blockquote   p7.19.3 Filesp      p3 When a stream is emunbufferedem, characters are intended to appear from the source or at the destination as soon as possible. Otherwise characters may be accumulated and strongtransmitted to or from the host environmentstrong as a block. When a stream is emfully bufferedem, characters are intended to be strongtransmitted to or from the host environmentstrong as a block when a buffer is filled.   When a stream is emline bufferedem, characters are intended to be strongtransmitted to or from the host environmentstrong as a block when a newline character is encountered. Furthermore, characters are intended to be strongtransmitted as a block to the host environmentstrong when a buffer is filled, when input is requested on an unbuffered stream, or when input is requested on a line buffered stream that requires the transmission of characters from the host environment. Support for these characteristics is implementationdefined, and may be affected via the codesetbufcode and codesetvbufcode functions.p      p7 [...] As initially opened, the standard error stream is not fully buffered the standard input and strongstandard output streams are fully bufferedstrong if and only if the stream can be determined not to refer to an interactive device.p blockquote  pThese definitions lead the following behavior is legal.

Negative 48748 pI am trying to write a simple log base 2 method.  I understand that representing something like stdlog8.0 and stdlog2.0 on a computer is difficult.  I also understand stdlog8.0  stdlog2.0 may result in a value very slightly lower than 3.0.  What I do not understand is why putting the result of a the calculation below into a double and making it an lvalue then casting it to an unsigned int would change the result compared to casting the the formula directly.

Negative 48748 pI assume everyone knows that a Promise is a datastructure that largely replaces callback as the way to handle asynchrony in Javascript.  A Promise can chained, cached, and otherwise manipulated in useful ways.p  pThe Angular watch function is vital to the functioning of Angular but it takes a callback and has the same shortfalls as callbacks generally.  Using a Promise instead would not appropriate because intrinsic to a Promise is the fact it is fulfilled or canceled exactly once.p  pSo I built an analogous structure I have provisionally named a codeHabitcode.  A Habit is much like a Promise.  You construct it with a scope and a watchexpression.  Instead of codethencode it has an codeoncode, which is called with a function. That function will be called whenever the watchexpression changes in the scope.p  pThe return value of the codeoncode is a new Habit, which will be fired with the return value of the function.  If that return value is a Promise, it will fire when the Promise is fulfilled.p  pFor example,p  precode  util.habitscope, userid     .onfunctionuserid            return .ajaxusers  userid                   .thenfunctionuser                       return user.name                         codepre  pwould create a Habit that fires whenever the userid changes in the scope and invokes its onfunctions with the new users name.p  pMy question arep  ol liIs this brilliant, obvious, oldhat, or stupidli liWhyli ol

So this would be the value 2 from the ValueID in the first sheet, and 2 in the second sheet. Lets call this blue.p  pAdditionally, because value 10  from sheet 1 does not exist in the other sheet, I would want to highlight this as a different color. The value 3 from the second sheet does not exist in the first, so I also would want this highlighted as the same color as value 10. Lets call this red. Value 2, however, is in both sheets, but just in a different position, so this would be highlighted in blue as mentioned above.p  pTo idetnify the numbers that are not in the same position, I have used the following code the first part is just setting up the loop for identifying sheet names  for the comparison refer to section IDENTIFIES VALUES in DIFFERENT POSITIONSp  precodeFor Each curSheet In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets      If curSheet.Name Like List Then      LOADS WORKSHEETS INTO ARRAY          ReDim Preserve ArraySheetsx          ArraySheetsx  curSheet.Name          x  x  1      End If  Next curSheet  LOADS RANGE INTO LIST ARRAYS FROM THE ARRAY OF WORKSHEET NAMES  For y  0 To UBoundArraySheets          ListArray  SheetsArraySheetsy.RangeArrayRange          If y lt UBoundArraySheets  1 Then          ListArrayToSearch  SheetsArraySheetsy  1.RangeArrayRange          Else          ListArrayToSearch  SheetsArraySheetsy  1.RangeArrayRange          End If  IDENTIFIES VALUES in DIFFERENT POSITIONS  For xRow  LBoundListArray, 1 To UBoundListArray, 1              For yCol  LBoundListArray, 2 To UBoundListArray, 2                      If ListArrayxRow, yCol ltgt ListArrayToSearchxRow, yCol Then                          CellsxRow, yCol.Select                             With Selection.Interior                                 .Color  1003520                             End With                      End If               Next yCol          Next xRow codepre  pSo far, this works fine and works fairly quickly on large datasets. However, this only finds those values that do not match positionally. I need to figure out how to QUICKLY identify those values that DO NOT exist in the other dataset at all. p  pObviously, I tried putting the array into a range and using COUNTIF but it makes the code drag on forever, it is too slow. My problem is that I want to compare EVERY value to see if it exists, and if so, if it is in the same position. All I can come up with so far is to loop through each value, compare its position to the other sheet and then compare it to the entire sheet using COUNTIF. But obviously this will take extremely long on a large dataset. Is there another way to do this using an array, or some other optionp

Negative 48748 pIm exploring ReactJS and trying to get a grasp of the core concepts. I started piecing a prototype of an application I am working on that has the following hierarchy of p  ul liCustomer ul liLocations ul liAddressesli liContactsli ulli ulli ul  pThe page I am working on would be an input form for a Customer and all of its related children. Each of these sections would have some text inputs to house data, so they seemed like a natural place to house a hierarchy of components. p  pFrom everything I have read about ReactJS, if you are going to manage state, you should do so in the common ancestor of all the controls. This means that any changes in the child should bubble the event up to the keeper of the state to handle changes. This should then update the state and any changes will be rerendered. This makes sense in simple scenarios, but that brings me to my slightly more complicated hierarchy.p  ul liIf a change happens down in one of the many Addresses, am I supposed to bubble up that event to the location then to the Customer li liIf so, what is the best way to tell state which specific address changed li liIf you have to call up through each level of the hierarchy, wouldnt that make a lot of extra boilerplate to propagate a simple changeli liShould I be attaching to the onChange event on each text box, or should I wait until I submit the form to gather the datali ul  pReact talks about ReactLink a hrefhttpsfacebook.github.ioreactdocstwowaybindinghelpers.html relnofollowhttpsfacebook.github.ioreactdocstwowaybindinghelpers.htmla as a way to manage more complex data binding, but doesnt give a great example of how to manage it with a larger hierarchy. Also, it states that most application shouldnt need this. Well, this application really isnt complicated, just a couple nested controls with shared state. This is where React is supposed to shine, so I wouldnt think to immediately jump to the edge case solutions.p

Negative 48748 pI have a JFrame.  It uses a JPanel as its content pane, and that JPanel uses GridBagLayout as its LayoutManager.  That JPanel contains two more items a button, and another JPanel.  On program start, an image is loaded from file into the lowestlevel JPanel as a BufferedImage using ImageIO.read....  Here is where everything goes to pieces.p  pThe image loads correctly, I can see a small corner of it on screen 14px square as specified in debugger.  There is nothing I can figure out that will cause the layout to grow and fit the entire image in the lowest level JPanel on screen.  The image in debuggers shows correct size of 500px.  The preferred size of the CardImagePanel shows up correctly as the same size as the image.  But the layout will not respect the preferred size unless I manually set the CardImagePanel size using setSize... which Im pretty sure is not supposed to be necessary with GBL.p  pI have tried putting revalidate and repaint calls on every single JFrame, JPanel, layout, grid bag, image, etc throughout the entire program and just cant find the correct place or time to call them to make this thing work.  Currently Ive been trying to just let the image load incorrectly and use the button to force revalidation and repaint, but even this explicit call is not doing anything.p  pIm losing my mind, Ill do anything to get this thing working.p  pHere is all my code for the whole stupid thing minus imports and package specification.p  pP1s1.javap  precodepublic class P1s1       public static void mainString[] args           TODO code application logic here         build           public static void build              JFrame frame  new JFrame         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         frame.setSizenew Dimension640, 480         frame.setContentPanenew GuiPanelframe         frame.setVisibletrue       codepre  pGuiPanel.javap  precodepublic class GuiPanel extends JPanel       JFrame parentFrame     JButton imageLoaderButton     CardImagePanel cardImagePanel     LayoutManager layout     GridBagLayout gridBagLayout     GridBagConstraints constraints      public GuiPanelJFrame frame              parentFrame  frame          constraints  new GridBagConstraints         gridBagLayout  new GridBagLayout          layout  gridBagLayout         this.setLayoutlayout          this.setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.black          setupImageLoaderButtonimageLoaderButton          cardImagePanel  new CardImagePanel         this.addcardImagePanel           private void setupImageLoaderButtonJButton button              button  new JButtonClick to load image         ActionListener imageLoaderListener         imageLoaderListener  new ActionListener               Override             public void actionPerformedActionEvent ae                  System.out.printlnButton clicked.                  cardImagePanel.revalidate                 cardImagePanel.repaint                  GuiPanel.this.revalidate                 GuiPanel.this.repaint                  parentFrame.revalidate                 parentFrame.repaint                               button.addActionListenerimageLoaderListener         this.addbutton       codepre  pCardImagePanel.javap  precodepublic class CardImagePanel extends JPanel       BufferedImage cardImage      public CardImagePanel              this.setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.black          try              cardImage  ImageIO.readnew Filecdevcards2ofclubs.png             this.setPreferredSizenew DimensioncardImage.getWidth, cardImage.getHeight          catch IOException ex              System.out.printlnException trying to load image file.

Negative 48748 pI would like to be notified of the button power being pressed on Android. To be clear, I am not looking to override the power button event, but simply being notified of when it has happened. From everything Ive researched so far, there is no such thing in Android. Please let me know if there is, or if there is one planned for Androids near future.p  pUntil now, I have been using screen onoff broadcasts in order to essentially guess that the power button has been pressed. However, since KK Watch API 20 or Lollipop API 21, even this, is no longer accurate. This is because although the broadcast is still named ACTIONSCREENON , they no longer refer to when the screen turned on but instead when the device became interactive, which can be delayed compared to when the screen actually came on. The same is true for ACTIONSCREENOFF, it actually refers to when the device is no longer in interactive mode, not exactly when the screen turned off. p  pThe Display class has some different display states which do actually refer to the screen state STATEOFF, STATEON, STATEDOZE, STATEDOZESUSPEND, or STATEUNKNOWN. You can get the display state with getState but theres no sort of broadcast system to notify that the state has changed, as far as I know.p  pDoes anyone know a way to get more accurately notified of the power button being pressed or the screen changing state If it comes down to it, I wouldnt mind a root solution either.p
