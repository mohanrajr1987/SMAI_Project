Positive 1190 pI am writing a webservice client which runs from the command line and accesses a service which uses Oauth2.p  pI seem to be getting the Oauth token correctly, and the first request to the webservice recognizes the token. However the response is a 303 redirect I have set codeCURLOPTFOLLOWLOCATIONcode  true however the subsequent page says that I have supplied no authentication token.p  pCurrently I am passing the oauth token by setting a header for the curl handlep  precodeAuthorization OAuth2 oauth codepre  pI suspect that the header is not being included in subsequent requests.p  pI tried setting  codeCURLOPTUNRESTRICTEDAUTHcode  true, to no avail but according to the manual, that persists a username and password across redirects  not the authentication header.p  pThe webservice allows for oauth tokens to be sent in an authentication header or in the URL but not as a cookie. Setting the token in the URL returns the same redirect i.e. without the token in the URL hence I cant use this method with codeCURLOPTFOLLOWLOCATIONcode.p  pthe service does not allow for oauth tokens sent in cookies, PHP version is 5.6p
Positive 1190 pI understand this question has been asked elsewhere on here but the solutions in those threads have not worked for me. I want to eliminate the trailing slash from my all my sites URLs with 301 redirects but I need this rule to NOT apply to my checkout page a hrefhttpsexample.comcheckoutonepage relnofollowhttpsexample.comcheckoutonepagea, which is an Ajax thing where you advance through 3 steps of checkout process that all take place on the one URL. That URL a hrefhttpsexample.comcheckoutonepage relnofollowhttpsexample.comcheckoutonepagea is the only time we use https URLs on the site and Im wondering if thats part of the issue.p  pThe rewrite rule I have does remove my trailing slashes, but does not allow me to advance through the checkout process. Clicking the Next button does nothing and eventually times out.p  precodeRewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteCond REQUESTURI checkout RewriteRule . 1 [L,R301] codepre  pHow can I fix my rulep

Negative 1190 pWhat I am asking, is what is the best way i.e. the way that is easiest for neophyte web developers to consumeintegrate data that I make available on my website, into their own website.p  pI have a website written in asp.netsql server back end.p  pI have clients that would like to be able to incorporate selections of data say for example a table of data and some images that varies in length and is different for each user into their website, so that the data looks like it belongs to them, and is branded by them ideally the data would come to them with default css formatting, but they could customizing as much as they want. When the data on my website changes, the data on their website needs to change.p  pId like the user of my data to come to my website, login, and then be able to  copy a customized scriptcode from my website, paste it into theirs and then just have it work, no matter what their website is written in i.e. pure html, php, asp.net or others.p  pI am assuming that a some sort of javascript script would be the best way to go, but I am at a loss as to how to make this completely simple for the user and what the script might contain javascript is not my strong point yet. I.e. can I get a javascript on a clients website call a asp.net script on my server and then stream HTML back to their website..p  pI am sure there must be examples of this done elsewhere, can someone point me in the right directionp  pstrongEDIT Let me try to give a better example of what I am trying to dostrong. p  pMy app is not a realestate app, but lets assume it us pretend realtor.com the MLS database. Now every realtor in the country has their own website, and they are written in all kinds of languages so I cant assume anything about the consumer of the data, nor can I assume they have any programming expertise.p  pIf I was realtor.com owner, Id like every realtor to be able to come to my website, copy a snippet of code like I said, perhaps some javascript but I am not sure, go back to their website and paste it into the source of their page and then when one of their users goes to Joesrealty.com and clicks on Show all properties for sale the scriptcodepage would actually pull html down from my site by executing something on my website realtor.com and retrieve a list of all properties that that agent had for sale say a table with accompanying picture. p  pI know I saw a great implementation of this somewhere on a big name site, but for the life of me cant remember where I saw it, and never bothered at the time to try and see what technology they used.p
Negative 1190 pHow can I find the state of NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock keys in .net p
Negative 1190 pIve got a rather large database of location addresses 500k from around the world. Though lots of the address are duplicates or near duplicates.  Whenever a new address is entered, I check to see if it is in the database already, and if so, i take the already existing latlong and apply it to the new entry.  The reason I dont  link to a separate table is because the addresses are not used as a group to search on, and their are often enough differences in the address that i want to keep them distinct. If I have a complete match on the address, I apply that latlong. If not, I go to city level and apply that, if I cant get a match there, I have a separate process to run. p  pNow that you have the extensive background, the problem. Occasionally I end up with a latlong that is far outside of the normal acceptable range of error. However, strangely, it is normally just one or two of these latlongs that fall outside the range, while the rest of the data exists in the database with the correct city name.p  pHow would you recommend cleaning up the data. Ive got the geonames database, so theoretically i have the correct data. What im struggling with is what is the routine you would run to get this done. p  pIf someone could point me in the direction of some low level data scrubbing direction, that would be great. p

Negative 1190 pLinq to SQL and Linq to Entities depend on creating dynamic SQL to do a lot of their work, specially when you have classes represent database tables in some fashion. However if the databases does not allow ad hoc SQL queries and everything has to go through stored procedures, I dont see the big value of using L2Q or L2E if the developer has to write all the SPs upfront to do all the work AND know that these are the all SPs that will ever be used in all scenarios in the app.p  pViews might alleviate the situation but if creating views need DBA permissions, it is still a hassle.p

Negative 1190 pUsing PHP and ZendACL, I want to create an extremely flexible permissions system. I want to be able to assign permissions to all objects of a certain type, as well as to instances of those objects. If a specific instance of an object is queried and it doesnt exist in the resource tree then the permission set for the generic object can be used. My problem is that this needs to nest and I cant figure out a way to do it without multiple inheritance, which ZendACL doesnt support.p  pAn example would be this. An online learning site with faculties, courses, and events. Each event belongs to a course, and each course to a faculty. I would like to be able to permit each faculty role to access all the courses and events by inheritance, but a particular faculty wants their material private. So I make the structure of my resource tree have a resource node for each faculty and have each course belonging to that faculty branch from the faculty node instead of branching from the generic course node which gives each course its default permissions. With the new structure how can I apply my generic course permissions The same goes for events below courses, if I want each event to only be readable if the parent course is readable, but I also want to apply a default set of permissions to each event, how can I organize the tree such that each event inherits from its parent and its generic node without multiple inheritancep  pAny questions or comments or suggestions for a different system are very welcome. p

Negative 1190 pIf I have the following example file where each number is represents a byte 123 has bytes 1, 2, and 3p  precode123456789 codepre  pLets say I create a FileInputStream. This reads in the binary byte by byte. So .read returns 1, then 2, etc. Now lets say I create a buffer. The initial chunk it reads in if I understand buffers correctly is 15. This allows it to not only read in byte by byte, but in the case of characters whole lines, etc. But if I hit .read again, I start at 6, and NOT where the BufferedReader stopped so if 3 is a line break, and I told the BufferedReader to print the first line, it prints 12, and then using .read from the FileInputStream gives me 6, and not 3.p  pIn order to be able to parse data by the delimiter, does a Scanner implicitly create a buffer like how a BufferedReader creates a buffer so that it can find line breaks, etc And if I pass a separate FileInputStream into the Scanner, using .read will NOT print the first byte following the first delimiter the scanner found, but rather at the end of the chunk the scanner tookp

Negative 1190 pApologies if this is not the right place to ask but here goes...p  pWhat should I use to create a simple web application for our websitep  pIm the IT guy for a small nonprofit. On our website we have a page with a large form in which users can fill out information on an application form. The information gets sent to a MySQL db. This data can then be accessed and edited by a couple of members of staff behind a loggedin part of the website. Theres only two dbs being used the main one with all the data and the one used for login details for the web app. Its all done with PHP and functionally is fairly simple  just a form with lots of fields to collect data and a basic secure manager page to do a bit of stuff with that data.p  pThe problem is that we need to make changes to the app, and to extend its functionality quite a lot. I have a little bit of experience playing around with PHP but Ive taken one look at the code used and decided itll take too long to decipher it and see whats happening where. The code is uncommented and a bit of a mess.p  pIm starting to think that rather than investing time to relearn what little I knew about PHP and untangle all the code, I might invest the time in learning another language andor framework to get this done. I want the resulting web app to be a lot easier to maintain in future by me or anyone else who comes along and has to make a change.p  pWould you recommend using DjangoPython for a project like this ZendPHP Just PHP and notepad I want the app to be done fairly quickly so the less steep the learning curve the better.

Negative 1190 pI have run into trouble trying to implement functionality for serializing some classes in my game. I store some data in a raw text file and I want to be able to save and load tofrom it. The details of this, however, are irrelevant. The problem is that I am trying to make each object that is interesting for the save file to be able to serialize itself. For this I have defined an interface ISerializable, with purely virtual declarations of operatorltlt and operator.p  pThe class Hierarchy looks something like thisp  precode              gt GameObject gt Character gt Player ... ISerializable               gt Item gt Container ...               gt Room ... codepre  pThis means there are many possible situations for serializing the objects of the different classes. Containers, for instance, should call operatorltlt on all contained items.p  pNow, since operator is virtual, i figured if I wanted to serialize something that implements the functionality defined in ISerializable i could just do something likep  precodeostream amp Playeroperatorltltostream amp os     Characteroperatorltltos     os ltlt playerspecificproperty 1 ltlt           ltlt playerspecificproperty 2 ltlt ...     return os  codepre  pand thenp  precodeostream amp Characteroperatorltltostream amp os     GameObjectoperatorltltos     os ltlt characterspecificproperty 1 ltlt           ltlt characterspecificproperty 2 ltlt ...     return os  codepre  pbut I quickly learnt that this first attempt was illegal. What Im asking here is stronghow do I work around thisstrong p  pI dont feel like implementing a function manually for each class. I guess Im looking for something like the codesupercode functionality from Java.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  p strongCOMMENTS ON EDITstrong  p  pAlright, last time I was in a hurry when I was writing the question. The code is now more like it was when I tried to compile it. I fixed the question and the problem I had was unrelated to the question asked. Im ashamed to say it was caused by an error in the wake of a large refactoring of the code, and the fact that the operator was not implemented in every base class.p  pMany thanks for the replies howeverp

In particular Im interesting in languages with features likep  ul liSyntax support such as that for dictionaries, array comprehensionsli liFunctions Keyword arguments, closures, tuplemultiple return valuesli liRuntime modificationcreation of classesli liAvoidance of specifying classes everywhere in Python this is due to duck typing, although type inference would work better in a statically typed languageli liMetaprogramming support This is achieved in Python through reflection, annotations and metaclassesli ul  pAre there any statically typed languages with a significant number of these featuresp

Id like to make the filter so that it filters with a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz.  p  pBased on what I have read on the web, to calculate the cutoff frequency in fractions of PI, the equation is 2  fc  fs, leading to a cutoff frequency of 0.002.  First off, is that correct  That value gives me coefficients that lead to values that are about three orders of magnitude smaller than I would have expected.  Second, when I plot the output of the filter on an array of 250 points, I expect a mostly flat line, but I get something that actually looks like an exponential into the negative.  That cant be right...can itp  pI apologize for not knowing that much about filters here.  It would be nice if somebody had an answer.p  pThanks  Robertp
Negative 1190 pUsing positionjitter creates random jitter to prevent overplotting of data points.p  pIn the below I have used the example of baseball statistics to illustrate my problem.

Negative 1190 pI am in the process of renovating our CMS and Ive run into a situation that I dont know which solution to adopt. Basically each one of our clients houses their websites content in their own database. This includes content, surveys, search words used by visitors, menu strucutre, etc.p  pA lot of the content on our clients websites is dynamic and they can change them via the CMS. All of this data is saved in a relational database Ive designed but Im running in a few situations where holding these preferences in a table would be overkill.p  pFor example, the CMS allows them to send emails to a list of recipients. They can choose to use our server or they can put in their own smtp server. However, in this case it would be a little overkill to create a table with a column for mailService and have it hold specific values since the table would only hold one row.p  pHere are the few ideas that Ive come up with by searching a bit on this site andor google but Im not too sure what their pros and cons arep  ul liBasically hold all the preferences in a table like I mentioned above, something Id like to avoid.li liHold all these single preferences in an XML file which Id modify when they change their settings.li liHave a table called preferences with the following columsn id, preferenceName, value . Each time Id have a new preference Id just add it, modify it, or remove it I dont like this option because I feel Id have to hardcode too many values... at least from the way Im seeing the implementationli ul  pIm kind of leaning towards the XML idea but Id like to get some feedback from the good community here at Stackoverflow  Maybe using XML would be a horrible idea for a reason Ive completely overlooked or theres a yourdumbwhydidntyoujustdothis solution.

Negative 1190 pI have to implement an HTTP client in Java and for my needs it seems that the most efficient way to do it, is implement HTTP pipeline as per a hrefhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc2616.txt relnofollowRFC2616a.p  pAs an aside, I want to pipeline POSTs. Also I am not talking about multiplexing. I am talking about pipelining i.e. many requests over one connection before receiving any response batching of HTTP requestsp  pI could not find a third party library that explicitly states it supports pipelining. But I could use e.g. a hrefhttphc.apache.orghttpcomponentscoreindex.html relnofollowApache HTTPCorea to build such a client, or if I have to, build it by myself.p  pThe problem I have is if it is a good idea. I have not found any authoritative references that HTTP pipelining is something more than a theoretical model and is properly implemented by HTTP servers. Additionally all browsers that support pipelining have this feature off by default.p  pSo, should I try to implement such a client or I will be in a lot of trouble due to servers implementations or proxies.  Is there any reference that gives guidelines on thesep  pIf it is a bad idea what would be the alternative programming model for efficiency Separate TCP connectionsp

Negative 1190 pFor every row in my table I am manually creating, there must be a LinkButton to delete a  database row that matches a column in the table. Because no 2 controls can have the same name, Ive had to use a GUID to name them so theyre all unique.p  pProblem is, right now when I click Delete, the page posts back with no changes, but Ive been told that I need to recreate the controls  but how do I recreate them in PageLoad when their IDs are randomly generated Heres my codep  precode Table table  new Table             table.GridLines

Negative 1190 pI realize this is a highly specialized question.. but here goes. I am using an implementation of SIFT to find matches on two images. With the current implementation that I have, when I match an image with is 90 or 180 degree version, I get matches that are off by around half a pixel consistently but its varies within a range. So for example, if a match is found at pixel coordinate x,y in im1, then the corresponding match in its 90 degree rotated image im2 is at x,y  0.5. If i use a 180 degree image then the offset appears in both x and y coordinates and only in the x if I use a 270 degree 90 rotated image.p  p1 First of all, I am assuming SIFT should give me the same matching location in a rotated image. An implicit assumption is that the rotation does not change the pixel values of the image which I confirmed is true. I use IRFAN View to rotate and save as a .pgm and the pixel values remain unchanged.p  p2 I have other implementations which do not give this offset. p  p3 I am assuming this offset is programming related and possibly has to do with conversion from scalespace keypoint coordinates to imagespace keypoint coordinate. p  pIm hoping someone has run across this problem or can point me out to a reference on how to convert from scalespace to imagespace.p

As a whole and individually and all pass fine, however in the web app they just seem to keep throwing random exceptions, and originally refused to persist outside of the Nhibernate cache.

Negative 1190 pI want the ExpandDynamicLinks method to act different from how its acting out of the box. We have created a solution which provides our customer a way to create subsites using branches very easy. However, when they use create links within an RTE field to items outside the context website the renderings wont render the pages correctly. I have a solution for this, but I want to implement it in the method that returns the correct markup for RTE fields. From what Ive read this is the ExpandDynamicLinks method in the LinkManager.

Negative 1190 pI am in the process of creating a huge web application, with a JavaScript based UI, and many events generated continuously.p  pTo avoid bad performance due to the huge amount of the event listeners needed, I of course opted to use a single event listener which will catch all the events generated from the children elements event bubbling.p  pThe problem is, this application is designed in such a way that one or more modules can be loaded into the main JavaScript library Im coding which is responsible for controlling the UI and every other aspect of the program. Of course every module should be completely independent from each other, so you can choose which methods to load, without affecting the general functionality of the library, only adding or removing features.p  pSince every module can operate in different DOM elements, I need to have at least a single event listener for each module, since two modules can listen for events generated by html elements placed in different DOM branches.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netYRejF2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netYRejF2ap  pIn this fiddle for example, the first button will let the first paragraph trigger an event, and its parent will catch it. The second button will let the second paragraph fire the event, but the div listening for the same event wont catch it, because its not fired from one of its sons.p  pSo my question is is it possible to have a single event listener, able to listen also to events triggered from elements that are not its sons elements placed everywhere on the pagep  pI was thinking about having a js object, or a dom node, which store the data of the element which triggered the event, and the event itself, then a general event will be fired on the global event listener no matter where its placed in the dom, and it will then read the data to discover which element generated which event, and act accordingly.p  pAny help or suggestion about better ways of achieving thisp
Negative 1190 pIve been looking through the N3291 working draft of C0x. And I was curious about extern template. Section 14.7.3 statesp  blockquote   pExcept for inline functions and class template specializations, explicit instantiation declarations have the effect of suppressing the implicit instantiation of the entity to which they refer.p blockquote  pFYI the term explicit instantiation declaration is standardspeak for codeextern templatecode. That was defined back in section 14.7.2.p  pThis sounds like its saying that if you use codeextern template stdvectorltintgtcode, then doing any of the things that would normally implicitly instantiate codestdvectorltintgtcode will not do so.p  pThe next paragraph is more interestingp  blockquote   pIf an entity is the subject of both an explicit instantiation declaration and an explicit instantiation definition in the same translation unit, the definition shall follow the declaration. An entity that is the subject of an explicit instantiation declaration and that is also used in a way that would otherwise cause an implicit instantiation 14.7.1 in the translation unit shall be the subject of an explicit instantiation definition somewhere in the program otherwise the program is illformed, no diagnostic required.p blockquote  pFYI the term explicit instantiation definition is standard speak for these things codetemplate stdvectorltintgtcode. That is, without the codeexterncode.p  pTo me, these two things say that codeextern templatecode prevents implicit instantiation, but it does emnotem prevent explicit instantiation. So if you do thisp  precodeextern template stdvectorltintgt template stdvectorltintgt codepre  pThe second line effectively negates the first by explicitly doing what the first line prevented from happening implicitly.p  pThe problem is this Visual Studio 2008 doesnt seem to agree. The way I want to use codeextern templatecode is to prevent users from implicitly instantiating certain commonlyused templates, so that I can explicitly instantiate them in the .cpp files to cut down on compile time. The templates would only be instantiated once.p  pThe problem is that I have to basically ifdef around them in VS2008. Because if a single translation unit sees the codeexterncode and noncodeexterncode version, it will make the codeexterncode version win and nobody would ever instantiate it. And then come the linker errors.p  pSo, my questions arep  ol liWhat is the correct behavior according to C0x Should codeextern templatecode prevent explicit instantiation or notli liIf the answer to the previous question is that it should not, then VS2008 is in error granted, it was written well before the spec, so its not like its their fault. How does VS2010 handle this Does it implement the correct codeextern templatecode behaviorli ol
Negative 1190 pI have RCP application that uses headless update with p2 repository, written in eclipse 3.6. After decission to be migrated to Eclipse 3.7 it turned out my workarround would not work, as some classes are no more there in 3.7. What was the issue in 3.6p  pstrongThe issue in Eclipse 3.6strong The application is checking for updates before the start of the core plugin. It tries to connect to the p2 repository. If there is connection to it, it searches for updates, if there are such, updates, if not it says nothing for update and continue. If there is no connection, there was exception that is deep in equinoxeclipse framework, that has been handled by the framework and it never appear to us, thus the application cannot say wheter there is connection or not, as result it says there is nothing to update.p  pstrongThe solutionstrong After some days speding in solutions for this i found a workarround for this. Solution was creating a class for validating the Status of the repository, e.g. do i have connection to it or not. Here is my classp  precodepublic class RepositoryValidator   private final static String urlExtension  artifacts.jar NONNLS1  private static RepositoryValidator instance  private RepositoryValidator     public static RepositoryValidator sharedInstance  if instance  null  instance  new RepositoryValidator  return instance   public IStatus checkRepositoryStatusURI repoURI  try  URI checkURI  new URIrepoURI.toString  urlExtension ILog logger  Activator.getDefault.getLog logger.lognew StatusIStatus.INFO, Activator.PLUGINID, CHECK REPOSITORY artifacts.jar   NONNLS1  checkURI.toString long result  RepositoryTransport.getInstance.getLastModified checkURI, new NullProgressMonitor if result  0  logger.lognew StatusIStatus.INFO, Activator.PLUGINID, RESULT FROM CHECK    result NONNLS1 return new StatusIStatus.ERROR, Activator.PLUGINID, WRONG SERVER RESPONCE NONNLS1   catch Exception e  return new StatusIStatus.ERROR, Activator.PLUGINID, CONNECTION EXCEPTION, e NONNLS1  return new StatusIStatus.OK, Activator.PLUGINID, REPOSITORY IS REACHABLE AND OK NONNLS1     codepre  pWhat i basically do here is checking when the artifacts.jar has been modified, if i can access it i have connection, if not i dont.p  pstrongThe Issue in Eclipse 3.7strong In the solution for Eclipse 3.6 i was using RepositoryTransport class, which is no more available in 3.7. I was trying to find out whether this class have been replaced by other, or is there a method in the available class i could reach similar functionality.

Negative 1190 pWhats the best way to rank blog posts based on a simple search string The most obvious way to handle it to me at least is to look for things LIKE the search string in the titles of the entries and their tags, as well as count occurrences of the search string in each entrys body.

So it will give us a linear speedup. But Scenario 1 considers the overhead involved in spawning and managing threads.  p  pMy doubt is this With Scenario 1, I am getting a speedup which starts out linear, but tapers off as we move to a higher number of iterations. With Scenario 2, I am getting a full on linear speedup irrespective of the number of iterations. I was told that in reality, Scenario 1 will give me a linear speedup irrespective of the number of iterations. But I think it will not because of the high overload due to thread management.

Negative 1190 pI need a collection in which i can store heapallocated objects having virtual functions.p  pI known about codeboostsharedptrcode, codestduniqueptrcode C11 and codeboostptrvectorlistmapcode, but they doesnt solve duplicate pointer problem.p  pJust to describe a problem  i have a function which accepts heapallocated pointer and stores it for future usep  precodevoid SomeClassaddT ptr    list.pushbackptr  codepre  pBut if i call codeaddcode twice with same parameter codeptrcode  codelistcode will contain two pointers to same object and when codelistcode is destructed multiple deletion of same object will occur.p  pIf codelistcode will count pointer which he stores and uses them at deletion time then this problem will be solved and objects will not be deleted multiple times.p  pstrongSo the question isstrongp  pDoes somebody knows some library with collections vector,list,map in essence of pointer with autodelete on destruction and support of reference countingp  pOr maybe i can solve this problem using some other techniquep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI need support of duplicate pointers.

But this is responsibility of clientside code  not the class which i designs. Even if i change codeaddcode signature and codelistcode container of course top  precodevoid SomeClassaddstdsharedptrltTgt ptr     list.pushbackptr  codepre  pthen somebody who doesnt know about codestdmakesharedcode still can write thisp  precodeSomeClass instance T ptr  new T instance.addptr instance.addptr codepre  pSo this is not a full solution which i wait, but useful if you write code alone.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pAs an alternative solution i found a clonning using generated copy constructor. I mean that i can change my codeaddcode function like thisp  precodetemplate lttypename Rgt void SomeClassaddconst Ramp ref    list.pushbacknew Rref  codepre  pthis will allow virtual method R  class which extends some base class interface calls and disallow duplicate pointers.

Negative 1190 pI have an issue with dynamically resizing the height of my sidebar div to match the content div.

Negative 1190 pAs far as I know the jQuery UI Range slider should move the nearest draggerhandle if one clicks on the slider.

Negative 1190 pI have a form that performs calculations live as the user enters data.  However, some of the calculations require that certain fields are filled out first.p  pFor instance, if I have 4 fields, and field 4 is a percentage of field 1, I have to make sure that the user has a value for field 1 before they can enter data into field 4.p  pOne thought I have is to give each field a datastep attribute with a sequential number.  When the form first comes up, all the fields are disabled except the first field.  When valid data is entered into the first field, the fields for the next step are enabled.  This also assumes that if the user then blanks out field 1 that the rest of the fields are then blanked out and disabled again.p  pIm pretty certain this solution would work, but would require a decent amount of JS code juqery to ensure it works properly, as well as serverside validations.  But one gotcha that Im slightly puzzled on is if you do a submit and serverside validation fails and you render the form again, how to maintain the disabledenabled state of the form fields  But I guess Ill deal with that problem after the current one.p  pSo the question is, is this a decent solution to the problem of forms that must be filled out sequentially  Has anyone else found a better solution or a more elegant method than what Im planning on implementing  Im fine with generic concepts or ideas I can pretty much code anything I need, Im just not sure of best practice to this particular problem.p

Negative 1190 pIve been looking around a lot and I cannot figure out where this problem is coming from.

Negative 1190 pstrongBackgroundstrong  I am developing a mobile site with lost of images, that take time to load on a 3G connection.p  pThe way my mobile site is designed, is that when a user clicks on a link, the page will open somewhere in the middle of the text position is defined by a div id.  p  pstrongThe problem is thisstrong  If a user is reading pagetext in the middle of the HTML page, and an image loads up above the text, mobile safari actually pushes down the text below the viewport.  So the user loses his position and has to scroll to find where he was at.  p  pWith a page that has lots of images, this happens over and over and over again.p  pThe images themselves are user posted images from all around the internet, so the width and height of the images arent known ahead of time to use the simple widthheight attributes in the images srcp  pstrongThe question is thisstrong I would like safari to maintain the persons current reading position, regardless of whats going on with image loading above and below the position on the page the user is currently at.p  pstrongDemonstrative examplestrongp  precodeltdiv idp1gt Text text ltimggt ltimggt ltimggt ltdivgt  ltdiv idp2gt Text text ltimggt ltimggt ltimggt ltdivgt  ltdiv idp3gt Text text ltimggt ltimggt ltimggt ltdivgt  ltdiv idp4gt Text text ltimggt ltimggt ltimggt ltdivgt codepre  pSo if the viewport starts centered at div id p3 on initial page load, and then the images in div p1 and p2 start filling in slowly over the 3G connection, Safari just pushes down the content to make room for the images, and the user is now staring at a bunch of images from div p2 instead of the starting text of div p3.p  pThanksp

Negative 1190 pI have a UINavigationController that gets three views pushed onto it as the user cycles through pages always same order  Ill call them views0, 1, and 2 to line up with navigation controller indicies. The views are created in Storyboard.p  pWhen the progression of views is done, and the user wants to return to the beginning, I use popToRootViewControllerAnimatedYES in response to a button push, and the UI appropriately returns to the view0.  However, I occasionally get phantom log statements in response to appwide notifications if I go through the cycle again, making it clear that view1 the middle view never got fully dealloced.  Im using ARC in xcode 4.2.1 with iOS5 code only, so ARC should be taking care of things pretty well.p  pIve seen a few posts suggesting that ARC wont dealloc views whose reference count hasnt dropped to 0, so Ive done everything I can to set properties to nil when done, and a doublecheck shows that nothing is left over when I push to the final view...and nothing outside of the NavigationController references view1 that I know of.  Profiling the app for zombies and memory leaks dont yield anything.p  pHow can I viewlogdebug what might still be referencing the view  How can I tell its been successfully dealloced without putting things in it that would prevent the deallocp  pMy code is essentially as followsp  pview0 pushes to view1 using a Push segue in storyboard.p  pView 1p  precode voidviewDidLoad           [super viewDidLoad]       register as observer for some notifications       set properties and format an image or two         voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated      [super viewDidAppearanimated]   start some animation here      void receiveNotification   NSObject newObject  [[NSObject alloc] init]  [newObject doStuff]   Remove notification observers       voidobjectDelegateMethodNSDictionary  dataReturned    do stuff with dataReturned  self.propertyName  dataReturned  [self performSegueWithIdentifierAllDone senderself]      voidprepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue senderidsender   if [[segue identifier] isEqualToStringAllDone]   View2ViewController destinationView  [segue destinationViewController]  destinationView.propertyMagic  self.propertyName  [self setPropertyNamenil] do same with all other properties   codepre  pView2p  precode voidviewDidLoad    display things based on self.propertyMagic       IBActionuserStartsOverButtonidsender   [self.navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimatedYES]   codepre  pGiven the above rough structure, if I dont remove view1 as an observer of notifications, it continues to respond and output to the log even though I cant see why it hasnt been dealloced.  Even when I DO remove the observers, memory usage continues to increase as I cycle through app runs and eventually things crash with no leakages detected in instruments.p  pHow do I figure this outp

Negative 1190 pConsider the following A text value added to a textbox on the client is added to viewstate on postback thus the value is still present in the textbox when the page has reloaded.p  pHow come when I move a value from listbox1 to listbox2 via jquery the items in listbox2 are not added to viewstate. note the items are selected before POST and the values in listbox2 are available on the server on postback via request.form.getvalueslistbox2.getvalueindex.tostringp  pIm not looking for a work around, Ive got that. Im want to know why the listbox2 values are not added. Is there some event being fired for the textbox but not the listbox  Just trying to better understand whats going on. Thanksp

Negative 1190 pThis is really frustrating..p  pWhen working with jQuery Mobile with predefined pages, it all goes smooth and easy, but what about more complex projectsp  pI am working on a survey system that renders the next page based on the previous answer. So every page has to submit the current question to an external API and get the next question. p  pemstrongMy first choice was to go big on JS,emstrong but the main problem with it was that the data has to be sent through AJAX and then injecting the new structured HTML has to be refreshed to render well. In addition to that, all AJAX requests have to have their callbacks the it creates a messy code. So, in my case a survey that has 2030 question composed as 15 different types of forms has some heavy use of callbacks and nested callbacks.p  pemstrongThen I rewrote the project with an PHP as the base.emstrong forms containing the surveys questions that submit to the same page with one datarolepage instance. With a CURL request I send the answer and got the next question, generated the HTML structure and voila  it all renders magnificently without no need for triggering the refresh. p  pBut using this method has its own problemsp  ul lisubmitting to the same page deprives you from page emtransitionsem and leaves you with the default fade transition. li lijQuery mobile has    this weird emcachingem even after I used every method to disable itli lipassing the data from page to page is tricky  GET is lengthbr limited and POST didnt fit to my needs since the actual CURL request had to submit param1val1amp..li ul  pstrongSo, What way is the best to work with jQuery Mobile when working on a complex and dynamic projectstrongp  pThanks,  p
Negative 1190 pThis issue is specifically for a production site using Django Compressor.

Negative 1190 pI have a form which has a RichTextBox docked to the left and DataGridView docked to the right. RTB is set to readonly. Im trying to implement a special drag and drop feature where if the user holds the mouse down on a special keyword, it creates a textbox on top of the keyword which the user can drag to the DGV to drop the textbox off. When the textbox is successfully dropped off on the DGV, the DGV loads some information about the keyboard.p  pAlthough I can just easily capture the mousedown amp mousemove event on the form itself to implement the above feature, I feel like using the mousemove event to consistently update the position of the textbox is a very inefficient way of approaching this problem and will result in poor performance. Id like to hear any better ideas about handling the above problem. Thans.p

Negative 1190 pI am using CORS to call a cross domain API, however Internet Explorer is giving issues. CORS should be possible in IE8 and IE9 through the codeXDomainRequestcode object, however I cant get things to work..p  pJQuery a hrefhttpbugs.jquery.comticket8283refusesa to provide native support for XDomainRequest, however several jQuery plugins are suggested to add this support. This a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10232017ie9jqueryajaxwithcorsreturnsaccessisdeniedtopica suggest two such plugins a hrefhttpsgithub.comMoonScriptjQueryajaxTransportXDomainRequestblobmasterjQuery.XDomainRequest.jsjQuery.XDomainRequest.jsa and a hrefhttpsgithub.comtlianzaajaxHooksblobmastersrcajaxxdr.jsxdr.jsa, which has been reported to work. Afaik, the plugins should automatically override behavior of codejQuery.ajaxcode. I found another plugin a hrefhttpsgithub.comOveacorsblobmastersrcmainresourcescomoveacorsjquery.ie.cors.jsherea.p  pI put a little demo pages with the respective plugins a hrefhttpwww.stat.ucla.edujeroencorstest1.htmljQuery.XDomainRequesta and a hrefhttpwww.stat.ucla.edujeroencorstest2.htmlxdra and a hrefhttpwww.stat.ucla.edujeroencorstest3.htmljquery.ie.corsa that perform ajax requests to a CORS enabled server. The pages are working in Chrome and Firefox, however IE89 instantly throw a permission denied error even before making the request. This a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSiewebdevelopmentthread30ef3add767c4436b8a9f1ca19b4812eMSDN posta suggest adding another handler codexhr.onprogress  function code but I tried this and it isnt working either.p  pAny clues what I am doing wrong I have also tested with IE8 now using MS virtual server, but it has exactly the same problem.p  pEdit OK so I figured out that part of the problem was that I was using POST over HTTPS. Apparently XDomainRequest does not allow CORS over HTTPS. I can switch to HTTP but I really need POST. p  pEdit2 See a hrefhttpsgithub.comMoonScriptjQueryajaxTransportXDomainRequestissues1this issue on githuba for the end of this story. It turns out that when using HTTP POST, the xDomainRequest can only encode the request body arguments as codetextplaincode. This pretty much makes it worthless, because everyone uses codeapplicationxwwwformurlencodedcode or codemultipartformdatacode. p  pSummary I highly recommend not investing any time in XDomainRequest, because it is a terribly poor implementation with many limitations. It basically only really works for GET requests to nonssl servers, so you might as well use codejsonpcode or whatever.p
Negative 1190 pWhen rendering to a frame buffer object in gles 2.0 I have some strange artifacts on the Mali400 gpu. Problem is that some pixels have different colors than others even if I fill the whole screen with the same color. But it works fine on a Tegra2 gpu. Does the Mali use any texture compression by default My fbo uses GLRGBA as internal format.  Thanks in advance p  pEdit I guess I solved my own question.

Negative 1190 pIs it possible to define an array of locales used in Symfony2 routing rules, so that I wont have to repeat it over and over in every route and alter it for each route separately in case I change the supported languages list p  pI know its very easy to do a quick emsearch amp replaceem in coderouting.ymlcode, embutem the issues scope could be easily expanded so that it provokes a question like this is it possible to provide this locale array externally i.e. to have it read from a databasep  pFor clarification  here is an example of what I have nowp  precodepageshow     pattern localepageslug     defaults  controller myCompanymyBundleCmspageShow      requirements         locale enpl         slug [,]  newsarchive     pattern localenewsarchive     defaults  controller myCompanymyBundleCmsnewsArchive      requirements         locale enpl codepre  pAnd here is an example of what Id like to havep  precodepageshow     pattern localepageslug     defaults  controller myCompanymyBundleCmspageShow      requirements         locale languages         slug [,]  newsarchive     pattern localenewsarchive     defaults  controller myCompanymyBundleCmsnewsArchive      requirements         locale languages codepre  pWhere codelanguagescode is an array, be it a YAML array or a PHP array provided externally its not really substantial.p  pThis could be very helpful to further ease the configuration of the application Im writing.

So that if I decide that, for instance, I want to add a new language quickly and I already support it in the business logic and templating layers, I just have to modify the languages array in codeconfig.ymlcode and voila, its done.p

Negative 1190 pIve been looking around Google for some answers as to how these systems actually work. I know very loosely that they involve the use of some sorts of unique tokens that the system is able to identify, but Im interested in knowing a lot more about these things.p  pAs a followup, the reason I need to know is because I am building a Ruby on Rails app using Devise for user authentication and may have need to be able to provide links that only work once for registration and automatically register a user as a certain type of user i.e. inviting people into the system for a specific purpose. I am, nevertheless interested in understanding and would love some reading material if anybody can point me to something comprehensive, relevant, and useful.p

Negative 1190 pMy website hosting service which I am stuck with insists that a home page is Abc.com and that other pages are Abc.comhere and Abc.comthere and Abc.comsomethingelse .  In code which is common to all the pages, I have a JavaScript script using a browser cookie e.g. myDailyValue17 with appropriate maxageexpires.  I wish to use path to give each page its own unique instance of the cookie, but the path for the home page must be  and such a path will be seen by other pages.  If there is no extant cookie, the other page will create its own path, eg. there, and so long as it is extant it will take priority over the  path, but when a user comes back after a week and starts at the home page, the  path cookie will be created and all other pages will defer to it and, not seeing an absenceofcookie, will not create their own cookies with their own values.p  pAt least, this is what I think is happening and must happen.p  pHave I got this right  Are there wellknown workarounds, or must I jigger the code to use a different cookie name on the home pagep  pThank you for reading this far.

Im almost there, but Im running into an odd problem... p  pWhen I apply the transform to change the height of the overlay, the viewport changes  it zooms out. No matter what size I resize the box to in terms of height, the viewport zooms out the bigger I make the box, the more the viewport zooms out. I am using the meta tag . The odd thing is that this doesnt happen width. The width of the overlay transforms nicely to full screen width, no viewport changes.  Its just with the height.p  pAny ideas Im sure Im missing something simple.p  pHeres some code in case it helps. Note Ive made some changes to the fancybook lib, so if you see something that looks odd below, thats why. As I said, I dont think this is anything to do with Fancybox, its mobile Safari that Im struggling with.p  pThe transitionp  precodevar F  .fancybox  F.transitions.fullScreen  function  var cssProps  F.getPositiontrue cssProps.top  parseIntcssProps.top, 10  px cssProps.opacity  1   set the wrapper to its starting point and show it F.wrap.csscssProps.show  .fancyboxinner.csswidthcssProps.width, heightcssProps.height  window.setTimeoutfunction     var leftPos  F.wrap.offset.left     var topPos  F.wrap.offset.top     .fancyboxwrap.csswebkittransform translate3dleftPospx,topPospx,0, width 880px, height 500px   ,200   codepre  pThe CSSp  precode.fancyboxwrap webkittransitionall 1s easein   webkittransform translate3d0,0,0 webkittransitionduration 1000ms      codepre  pCheersp
Negative 1190 pHow can you toggle or show a hidden element thats in the HTML instead of a database using jQuery Autocompletep  pHere is the a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcazepedakMcFZ21 relnofollowjsFiddlea that has the elements Ive been using. Everything is working fine except I dont know how to proceed in showing the hidden elements thatd match the search sources.p  pThe source variables in the JavaScript match the class names of the hidden elements in the HTML page that has the autocomplete search field. So depending on what element youre searching for this example searching for HTML5 elements a result will appear when the source matches the hidden class element.p  pIve been looking at the a hrefhttpdocs.jquery.comPluginsAutocompleteresult relnofollowresult handlera but cant seem to wrap my head around it with the code I have now.p  pAny help regarding my issue would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 1190 pIt might look like an odd question but the fact is I currently have a existing spreadsheet with data, not a lot, of hundreds of rows. What I am willing to do is a web app provide search interface for data maybe some more advanced features in future, like data update. Thus I have two optionsp  ul liI can programme on top of the excel, i.e. readwrite spreadsheet directlyli liOr I can export the whole data to a database, say mysql, and work around it. The data conversion does take time but will not be very bad.li ul  pWhat I need to consider isp  ul liif it is easy to code, for either solution. I have some experiences coding C with mysql but never touch Excel programming. If the learning curve is too steep I would rather spend days to export all data to database.li liif it is easy to maintain. Day to day work like search or update will be done through web once the app is on. It needs to be stable and easy to expand. More features like comparing different columns or, reformating some data and emailing out could be considered.li ul  pAny suggestions And, what language, libraries or framework I should pick upp
Negative 1190 pIm using a codeQSqlQuerycode object to do a linear walk of a 10million row SQL table with a very complex 6 column primary key in sorted order. Because of the keywhich I CAN NOT change, breaking upmy query codeSELECT  FROM table1code with codeltcode or codegtcode with codeLIMITcode causes a huge number of issues with the algorithm Im using.p  pMy problem arising is as follows, for whatever reason codeQSqlQuerycode seems to be caching the entire result set in memory until it hits a bad alloc and kills the application. So I may read some couple hundred rows, codeseekcode over a couple hundred thousand, and by this point codeQSqlQuerycode is using 300mb of memory and my application dies. I read the docs and it seems the only thing that can be done is to use codesetForwardOnlycode, however I often have a need for codepreviouscodewhich is why breaking up the query with LIMIT is a PITAp  pIs there no way to cap the cache for codeQSqlQuerycodep

Negative 1190 pI asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12345292howdoenableanetwebapitoacceptgzipedpoststhis questiona a few days ago, and I didnt get a lot of activity on it. And it got me thinking that perhaps this was because my question was nonsensical.p  pMy understanding of http is that a client typical a browser sends a request get to a server, in my case IIS. Part of this request is the acceptencoding header, which indicates to the server what type of encoding the client would like the resource returned in. Typically this could include gZip. And if the server is set up correctly it will return the resource requested in the requested encoding. p  pThe response will include a ContentEncoding header indicating what compression has been applied to the resource. Also included in the response is the ContentType header which indicates the mime type of the resource. So if the response includes both ContentType  applicationjson and ContentEncoding gzip, the client knows that resource is json that is has been compressed using gzip. p  pNow the scenario I am facing is that I am developing a web service for clients that are not browsers but mobile devices, and that instead of requesting resources, these devices will be posting data to the service to handle. p  pSo i have implemented a Restfull service that accepts post request with json in the body. And my clients send their post requests with ContentTypeApplicationjson. But some of my clients have requested that they want to compress their request to speed up transmission. But my understanding is the there is no way to indicate in a request that the body of the request has been encoded using gZip. p  pThat is to say there is no contentEncoding header for requests, only responses. p  pIs this the case p  pIs it incorrect usage of http to attempt to compress requestsp

Like thisp  precodestruct Node      vectorltintgt conNode  vectorltNodegt listOfNodes vectorltintgt nodeListA     a subset of nodes of interest stored as their vector indices codepre  pI need to look for nodes that nodes in nodeListA are connected to, but only if those nodes are also in nodeListA.

Negative 1190 pI recently ran into a case where Cassandra fits in perfectly to store time based events with custom ttls per event type the other solution would be to save it in hadoop and do the bookkeeping manually ttls and stuff, IMHO a very complex idea or switch to hbase.

Negative 1190 pAs of know my email application was supporting only plain text with attachments.

But really i am  not getting how to create the body parts at run timw when i do not what body and attachment list will contain. For example body can contain only plain text or html body or html body with attachment or html body with inline image with attachment or plain body with attchment. p  pFrankly i am not getting how to process the emailbody and attachment list for above mentioned permuations and combinations.for example some time i need to create top message as multipartmixed containg body parts as mulipartalternative and another body part plain, bla bla..... strongIs there standard code handling these all scenarios based on body content and attachment list.

Negative 1190 pI want to create an application that is capable of loading plugins. The twist is that I want to be able to create plugins in both CC and Python.p  pSo Ive started thinking about this and have a few questions that Im hoping people can help me with.p  pMy first question is whether I need to use CC for the core of the application the part that actually does the loading of the plugins This is my feeling at least, I would think that implementing the core in Python would result in a nasty performance hit, but it would probably simplify loading the plugins dynamically.p  pSecond question is how would I go about defining the plugin interface for CC on one hand and Python on the other The plugin interface would be rather simple, just a single method that accepts a list of image as a parameter and returns a list of images as a return value. I will probably use the OpenCV image type within the plugins which exists for both CC and Python.p  pFinally, I would like the application to dynamically discover plugins. So if you place either a .py file or a shared library file .so.dll in this directory, the application would be able to produce a list of available plugins at runtime.p  pI found something in the Boost library called Boost.Extension httpboostextension.redshoelace.comdocsboostextensionindex.html but unfortunately it doesnt seem to be a part of the official Boost library and it also seems to be a bit stale now. On top of that, I dont know how well it would work with Python, that is, how easy it would be to create Python plugins that fit into this mechanism.p  pAs a side note, I imagine the application split into two parts. One part is a stripped down core loading and invoking plugin instances from a recipe. The other part is the core plus a GUI that I plan on writing in Python using PySide. This GUI will enable the user to define the aforementioned recipes. This GUI part would require the core to be able to provide a list of available plugins.p  pSorry for the long winded question. I guess Im hoping for more of a discussion and of course if anybody knows of something similar that would help me I would very much appreciate a pointer. I would also appreciate any concise and to the point reading material about something similar such as integrating CC and Python etc.p

Negative 1190 pI am creating a factory which uses a delegate to call a static method on each registred type in order to create an instance of the type.p  pIn the factory I have the delegate definitionp  precodepublic delegate GridColumnBase ColumnFactoryMethod codepre  pand I would like each type inheriting from codeGridColumnBasecode to implement a static codeCreateInstancecode method. I cant make codeCreateInstancecode a codestatic abstractcode member of codeGridColumnBasecode, so how do I enforce that each class implement this methodp  pstrongEditstrong Thinking about this a little more I reached a conclution that codeCreateInstancecode is not a feature of a class inhereting codeGridColumnBasecode, but is a feature of a class wanting to be included in the factory. Maybe I dont need to enforce this on the base class level. Maybe I need to leave it to the implementing class to decide how it whishes to participate in the factory process, i.e. passing in to the factory any function it whishes to delegate. Does this make sense to anyone but me p

Negative 1190 pIm building a simple hierarchical template with jinja. I was splitting my monolithic html file in smaller chunks to reuse them.  In my html I had accented characters like ... when I tried to run the app I received errors complaining about  my files not beeing properly encoded. So I decided to adhere to utf8 standars and substituted those characters with things like codeampugravecode  and so on... This worked but is seems a bit cumbersome as a workflow. Im wandering which is the correct approach to this kind of problems both with template files and content that have to be rendered in those templates.p  pI suppose that it is good practice to encode texts in utf8 before storing them but Im not sure.p

Oddly enough though, the Size value for each font is never shown in Bold ie appears unchanged.p  pStandard published properties can be made codedefaultcode very easily, but how can you do this with classes like TFont that has subpropertiesp  pI cannot see a way of setting the default values from the class structure, only in the constructor. Even if I could define the default values from the class structure which seems impossible I doubt it would work because the font has not been created yet. For example which obviously does not workp  precodepublished   property FontHot TFont read FFontHot write SetFontHot default FFontHot.Color  clRed lt set default codepre  pSo, how can I make a published TFont property show as default and unchanged when adding the new component to the Object Inspectorp  pI guess the same would apply to other classes similar to TFont which as subproperties.p

I have for a while had successful UDP communication between the two devices but now I want to recover the port from the endpoint the server discovers when the client connects. The way the client connects is via queryp  precodeudpresolver resolverioservice udpresolverquery querytxudpv4, hostIP, 43210 udpendpoint receiverendpointtx  resolver.resolvequerytx codepre  pwhere host IP is a string and this works fine.

Now dont jump the guns and yell out network byte order and host byte order. I AM AWARE.

Negative 1190 pI have an app that launches a view by codextypecode on startup to get the user to sign up. This view has some selectfields and all works as expected. The use also has the option to skip this view and access it later. When the user accesses this view at a later time, I have an issue where data is not being appended to the correct elements. The values are being set but running codeExt.ComponentQuery.query[itemIditemname]code returns 2 elements. Somehow the elements of this view are getting duplicated.p  pI have also tried setting codeautoDestroy truecode on the config for this view but this has no effect whatsoever.p  pI have also tried manually destroying the view using codedestroycode method on the codedeactivatecode event. When I do this, the behavior turns strange and selecting an item from another pushed view and returning back to the profile screen causes the navigationview to break as if this view is not present. The header of the navigationbar breaks and the back button is incorrectly shown.p  pWhy are the view elements being duplicated How can I prevent this.p
Negative 1190 pI have a page with an options menu, however would like the user to pass the captcha test. Currently i want it so the user enters atleast 3 characters in the textbox or else they would not be able to submit the form, the code is shown below with the php condition at the end of the form. However i know i have obviously got it wrong.   Is there anyway to do this without pasting the php code on another page Thanks. p  precodeltphp  Check to see if the form has been submitted. ifissetPOST[menu1]     If the form has been submitted, force a redirect to the choice selected.   headerLocation  .

Again this is for testing and demonstration purposes.p  pI test it out by navigating directly to the filep  precode wget O  saveheaders localhostmodpagespeedexampleimagesPuzzle.jpg Cachecontrol public, maxage10 codepre  pwhich works fine. But then I try to load the page with modpagespeed and extendcache enabledp  precodewget O  saveheaders localhostmodpagespeedexampleextendcache.htmlModPagespeedonampModPagespeedFiltersextendcache ltimg srcimagesPuzzle.jpggt  wget O  saveheaders localhostmodpagespeedexampleextendcache.htmlModPagespeedonampModPagespeedFiltersextendcache ltimg srchttplocalhostmodpagespeedexampleimagesxPuzzle.jpg.pagespeed.ic.hgbHsZe0IN.jpggt codepre  pThis is all fine and dandy. The initial request doesnt work because it needs to load the info into the cache, but from there it correctly replaces the src of the img tag with the cached, hashed version.p  pHowever, this only persists UNTIL maxage. So, if I have it set to 10 seconds, it will continue to point to codehttplocalhostmodpagespeedexampleimagesxPuzzle.jpg.pagespeed.ic.hgbHsZe0IN.jpgcode, but then it will revert to codeimagesPuzzle.jpgcode again after 10 seconds, at which time it will go back to the cached version.p  pIs this expected behavior I would think that pagespeed would check the hash after maxage, and if its the same it wouldnt bother changing it back to the original value, but instead continue serving the cached file.p  pThis is somewhat concerning. If I set maxage to something more useful, say 60 minutes, that will allow me to continue to update these asset files and assure that my updates are seen in a timely manner. However, if the site is visited once per day by users, then that is more than the maxage and they will always be served the original file rather than the cached version.p

Negative 1190 pIm trying to write a web form, which will have selectable options based on users input from earlier in the form.p  pWhere Im getting stuck isp  ul liI have a table room types, which is just td tags with input tags typetext.

The table layout is the same except there are two columns, rather than one, and extra lines are added via another button with Jquery.p  pWhat Id like to be able to do, is for new lines added to have two columns in the table.  One input text field, and the other a select box with options taken from the table above.p  pIve managed to get this working to a point.  But as users may go back to edit options from the original room types table, I need the select boxes to adjust their values based on what the original table currently says.p  pI can get this working by emptying and repopulating my select boxes everytime one of the input fields accessed using OnBlur, which is probably not the most effective way to do this, but since it removes entries from the bxes, and then repopulates, any of the select boxes that have been populated already get reset.

Negative 1190 pI am developing a web application with JSF with Primefaces. It is essential to navigate with keys within most of the JSF pages, avoiding the mouse as much as possible. Return key is preferred to forward navigation than the Tab key. The navigation path is mostly predetermined, but some cases, it is decided on run. For example, pressing the return key at the txtItemQuantity input box, cursor has to go to dtpExpiry, if the items has an expiry date or need to click the Add button if there is no expiry date.

Negative 1190 pI have been using the form builder with Symfony2, and find it quite nice.  I find myself wanting to create a search page with a series of boxes at the top to filter search results.  I have three different entities as of now judges, interpreters, attorneys.  I would like the users to be able to enter partial or complete names, and have it search all of the entities.  I can handle the actual searching part, but the form builder generation is what is giving me trouble.p  pWhat I am trying to do is create a form not attached to any particular entity.  All the tutorials and documentation Ive read on the Symfony site acts like it should be attached to an entity by default.  I am wondering if I should just attach it to any entity and just set each text field to mapped  false, if this is an instance where I should just hard code the form myself, or if there is some way to do this within form builder.p

Negative 1190 pI have set up a rails API for my iOS application. We have a group split feature that allows people to invite people to their group and split the entire bill equally. It is currently implemented and working well but as the group size grows the time to process the transactions really slows down due to them being in a loop rather then all at once. p  pIm curious if anyone else has tackled something similar or has any resources to point me in the right direction for something like this. Currently we are placing holds on each of the group members cards and if all of the holds are successful we capture them. We do this to ensure no one in the groups card bounces, if we went straight to debiting the cards we could be liable for chargebacks if someones card did bounce.

Negative 1190 phey guys so i am trying to solve this problem I am makeing a java method that takes in a 2D array and 2 ints to dictate a starting position  of a coin gatherer in the array.   The gatherer    is  greedy  and lazy    when    deciding    to  which   adjacent    location    either up, down,   left,   right  to  move next.  Its    greedy  because it  moves   to  the location with the    highest number  of  coins  and its    lazy    because it  will    stop    moving  if  no  adjacent    location    increases   its coin    treasure.   If  several adjacent    locations had   the same    highest number  of  coins,  the  gatherer    will    choose  to  move    to  the highest in  a   clockwise   fashion up,    right,  down,   left.  Diagonal locations  are not considered  adjacent.   The gatherer    empties the coins   from    any location    it  visits. Lastly,  the method  returns the coins   acquired    up  to  the point   when    the gatherer    doesnt move    anymore. this is what i have so far but the issue i am running into is the when running a junit test it gets a out of bounds error with the way i am checking the values of the surrounding values. any help fixing this would be appreciated.p  precode    public class Program3      public static void mainString[] args                public static int getCoinsint[][] map, int row, int col          int cointotal  map[row][col]     int[] numbers  new int[4]     int big  0     int a  map[row1][col]     int b  map[row1][col1]     int c  map[row][col1]     int d  map[row1][col]     whilea gt cointotal  b gt cointotal  c gt cointotal  d gt cointotal          numbers[0]  a     numbers[1]  b     numbers[2]  c     numbers[3]  d     big  findLargestnumbers     cointotal  cointotal  big      a  map[row1][col]     b  map[row1][col1]     c  map[row][col1]     d  map[row1][col]     ifnumbers[0]  big            row  row 1        col  col        ifnumbers[1]  big            row  row  1        col  col  1                 ifnumbers[2]  big            row  row        col  col  1             ifnumbers[3]  big            row  row  1        col  col            return cointotal          public static int findLargestint[] numbers       int largest  numbers[0]        forint i  1 i lt numbers.length i           ifnumbers[i] gt largest               largest  numbers[i]                               return largest           codepre

Negative 1190 pI have the following scenariop  pWPF Application using SQLitefile per System.Data.SQLite on a windowsshare as backend. Client is Windows 7 Home Editionp  pA user reported, that she was using the software, saving the new data she entered, but then after a while when she revisited the software, some of her stuff was gone.p  pShe said the session lasted until about 1150am  the timestamp on the SQLite file in question was 1055am. I have a logfile in the same network share, it is written to using a filewriter with autoflush.p  pThe logfile looks normal until 1055am, then there is one line with rubbish looks like several lines written together in one, then goes on as normal.p  pClearly the network or maybe the drive must have had a hiccup at that time. Miraculously my application just continued as normal. No exceptions were thrown, according to the logfile all transactions are completed. No journal file remains to tell the tale. This behaviour  although wonderous in itself  is not appreciated by the user p  pMy question what happened here and how can I prevent it in the future Did Windows 7 cache the file in the standby list and not care at all about comitting the changes to the actual disk Why is my application or the SQLite provider unaware of this p  pI will now build a confirmation mechanism that checks the timestamp on the backend file to see if it was actually changed at all after the last transaction, but that seems a bit silly. Just as silly as being very pedantic with catching exceptions when they are not being thrown p  pThank youp  pstrongTLDRstrong SQlite file shows no changes after momentarily hardware network or drive failure, but the application seemingly continues to function and no exceptions are thrown by System.Data.SQLite.p

Negative 1190 pAn example of what I am attempting to do is below. Since Java is a static typed language, knowing the codetypecode of inputs and outputs is crucial. However, an application I was given to rewrite was written in a graphical programming language called Grasshopper 3D, which is a plugin to Rhino, an architecture software. Since I will be rewriting the components, I am interested in knowing the codetypecode of inputs and outputs. The input is usually easily to define, as the C scripting component allows you to set input codetypecode, however, the output is usually unknown.

Any words afterwards whos signature is the same is then pushed back onto the same vector, etc. I am getting a segmentation fault, will show exact location below.p  pBST.hp  precodeifndef BSTH define BSTH include ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt include ltstringgt  using namespace std  class Node  class BST    private    class Node       public       string key       Node left, right       vectorltstringgt data      Nodestring k, Node l, Node r, vectorltstringgt d  keyk, leftl, rightr, datad         Node root    void traversevoid fconst stringamp key, vectorltstringgtamp value, Node root   public    BST    BST    Node findNode root, const stringamp key    void insertNode amproot, const stringamp key    vectorltstringgtamp operator[]const stringamp key    void traversevoid fconst stringamp key, vectorltstringgtamp value   endif codepre  pBST.ccp  precodeinclude BST.h  BSTBST     root  nullptr   BSTBST     delete root   BSTNode BSTfindNode root, const stringamp key     ifroot return nullptr    ifrootgtkey  key return root    else ifrootgtkey gt key return BSTfindrootgtleft, key    else return BSTfindrootgtright, key   void BSTinsertNode amproot,const stringamp key     ifroot           vectorltstringgt data       rootnew Nodekey, nullptr, nullptr, data        else ifrootgtkey gt key BSTinsertrootgtleft, key    else BSTinsertrootgtright, key   vectorltstringgtamp BSToperator[]const stringamp key     Node tempBSTfindroot, key    iftempnullptr           return tempgtdata        else           BSTinsertroot, key       return BSTfindroot, keygtdata      codepre  pThe following 2 member functions are what gives the segmentation faultp  precodevoid BSTtraversevoid fconst stringamp key, vectorltstringgtamp value     Node tRootroot    iftRoot       traversef, tRoot    void BSTtraversevoid fconst stringamp key, vectorltstringgtamp value, Node root     stringamp keyrootgtkey    vectorltstringgt valuerootgtdata    ifroot           traversef, rootgtleft       fkey, value       traversef, rootgtright      codepre  pMain programp  precodeinclude BST.h include ltalgorithmgt include ltfstreamgt  using namespace std   Computes the signature of the string, which is the original string                                                                                                                                                                                                           arranged in alphabetical order.

Negative 1190 pIm trying to implement a recursive algorithm that counts all possible payment combinations for a given amount. I dont have much experience with recursion at all, so I would appreciate some help with this.p  pAvailable are the euro coins 1 cent, 2 cent, 5 cent, 10 cent, 20 cent, 50 cent, 1 euro, 2 euro.p  pSo Im looking for the absolute value of the function that gives the linear combinations of the 8 coins  for a given amount in cents.p  pThe absolute value or the set of all those linear combinations can be split into two disjoint subsets, namely M1 which is the set of all linear combinations not containing coin n and the subset M2 in which coin n comes up at least once in every linear combination, this is equivalent to the following img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwmbTd.jpg althttpimgur.com1TVv8OJp  pTo illustrate this here is an example for the amount of 5 cents, for which 4 different payment options exist, namely five 1cent coins, two 2cent coins and one 1cent coin, one 2cent coin  three 1cent coins, one 5cent coin.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeRRpp.jpg altp  pThis is what I implemented in Javap  precodepublic class Coins    static int[] c   1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 static long M1  0   public static long pay  int m      int n  c.length     long M  paym, n     return M   private static long pay int m, int n       if  n  1                 return 1          if  m  0         return 1     if  m lt 0         return 0     M1  paym, n  1  paym  c[n1], n     return M1   public static void mainString[] args      int m  6     long norm  paym     System.out.printlnnorm   codepre  pThis implementation does not give me the correct solution, and Im not sure why it does not or what its doing at all.

Negative 1190 pI have a MapBox map created using TileMill with about 800 polygons census tracts. Ive loaded the map onto an HTML page. Also on this page is a D3.js chart. There is a dropdown menu that references those same 800 census tracts when one is selected, the chart changes to show the data from that row in the CSV file built from a D3.js a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock5872848 relnofollowexamplea.p  pWhat I need to do, and cannot find a way to do, is make this map so that when the tract polygon is clicked on the map, it updates the variable the tract is named TRACTCE10 in the map so that the chart also changes.

Negative 1190 pMy app functions like this an imageView that can be visible in portrait or landscape, and the user can swipe between images to change the image in the imageView. The issue is that if you swipe to select a different image and then rotate the device to landscape it shows the original image the user selected, not the current image that was being displayed in the imageView. I am wondering how I can get the id of the current image before it is rotated, and then set it for when it is in landscape. Would it be in the onPause method, or is there a onConfigurationChanged method I could use for thisp

Negative 1190 pI have been fighting with this for three days and I am about ready to smash my computer.  Sorry, had to vent.p  pI have a WPF 4.5 application following the MVVM pattern with Entity Framework 6 as the model.  In my application there is a Tab control in the main application window which contains a viewviewmodel for each tab.p  pThe tab I am having trouble with is a simple master and detail view with a listbox for the list and a grid for the detail.  The grid contains textboxes, comboboxes, and datepickers that are bound to the properties of the listboxs selected item.  Everything works great when this view is first created and accessed by the user.  But when I click on another tab and click back into this tab I get the following problem.p  pstrongMy Problemstrong  Once another tab gets the focus and then the focus is returned to this tab, there two combo boxes that start to have binding issues.  p  pThe problem is not consistent, but for some reason the comboboxes start displaying incorrect values for the records.  When I click through the listbox selecting different records, the comboboxes start to display wrong values and the binding is wrong as well in the viewmodel.  But there are 10 other comboboxes and many more textboxes in the grid that display the right value for their respective properties without any errors.  p  pI cant figure out why these two comboboxes start displaying the wrong values once the views tab gets its focus back from another tab.p  pHere is the declaration for the two comboboxes that are getting incorrect values, that selected item of the listbox is bound to the Selection property in the viewmodelp  precodeltContentControl NameSelection DataContextBinding PathSelection, ModeTwoWaygt     ltGrid gt         ltComboBox NameidForeman                StyleStaticResource FTCDetailComboBox               ItemsSourceBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorTypexType UserControl,PathDataContext.EmployeeForemanCVS.View               SelectedValuePathidEmployee               SelectedValueBinding idForeman, ModeTwoWay, ValidatesOnDataErrorsTrue  gt             ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt             ....             ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt         ltComboBoxgt          ltComboBox NameidClient                 StyleStaticResource FTCDetailComboBox               ItemsSourceBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorTypexType UserControl,PathDataContext.ClientViewSource.View               SelectedValuePathidClient               SelectedValueBinding idClient, ModeTwoWay, ValidatesOnDataErrorsTrue               DisplayMemberPathchrCompany gt             ltComboBoxgt     ltGrid gt ltContentControl gt codepre  pHere is an example of a combobox that does not ever have an error, but works properly every timep  precodeltComboBox NameidEnteredBy        StyleStaticResource FTCDetailComboBox       ItemsSourceBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorTypexType UserControl,PathDataContext.EmployeeEnteredCVS.View       SelectedValuePathidEmployee       SelectedValueBinding idEnteredBy, ModeTwoWay, ValidatesOnDataErrorsTrue gt     ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt     ....     ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt ltComboBoxgt codepre  pAs you can see they are declared the same way to the same type of item source.p  pAll these controls are bound to a collectionViewSource that has an observableCollection for their source.

Negative 1190 pSo, heres the scenario. I have a site which allows you to perform certain operations on files, emwhich take on the order of secondsem. I dont want the client to have to wait that long before the server returns a response so they way we have it now is thatp  ol liUser performs an operation in their browser clientli liClient sends a POST request to server with parametersli liServer adds operation to job queue and sends back strongthe expected url of the resultstrongli liClient pings server until file is available then serves itli ol  pCurrently these files are being stored in my ec2 server but I want to move this to S3. I was wondering if this type of flow is possible. p  pThe server knows what the file will be saved and to where way before it actually is, so is that the same case with S3 Is there a way of knowing the file URL if I know all the information beforehand bucket, filename, etc p

I am using a RelativeLayout to align them so that when long message is inserted, the Time view doesnt get pushed to the side.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt  ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightwrapcontent androidlayoutgravityright androidgravityright androidpaddingLeft40dp androidorientationhorizontal gt  ltRelativeLayout      androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent      androidpadding10dp       androidbackgrounddrawablechatbubblesentgt      ltTextView     androidididdateView     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue     androidlayoutalignBottomidmsgTextView     androidtextDate     androidlayoutmarginRight10dp     androidtextSize12sp     androidtextColor343434     gt      ltTextView     androidididmsgTextView     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayouttoLeftOfiddateView     androidtextText goes here     androidtextColor040404     androidtypefacesans     androidtextSize15sp     gt   ltRelativeLayoutgt  ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pBut using this code, I am getting some empty space between those two views. I have seen some of the questions regarding this but i couldnt get the right solution..p  pif i use layoutwidthwrapcontent in msgTextView they are wrapped side by side, but there is empty space before those two views.. p  pIn any case I need to get rid of that empty space so that the background is just applied for those wrapped TextViews.

Negative 1190 pIm trying to figure how to retrieve the ID number from a selected value in a dropbox, displaying a list of projects from a table. p  pAt this point what i did was retrieve the value and then search it and get the ID number for that value in the table.

Negative 1190 pIm creating an Umbraco website that allows members to upload photos.p  pI was asked to create a page that lists only members that have uploaded photos. Photos are stored as Media and have an associated Member Picker property. I tried to formulate a way to get the list of members based on this field, but everything I can come up with seems like it would be very inefficient as the site grows.p  pI decided to create an additional property called Number of Photos on the member. When they upload a photo, the number increments. It works great until we get a spammer that starts uploading garbage. When the photo is deleted in the Media section, it does not automatically decrement the Number of Photos for the member.

Negative 1190 pThis is my first post here, I will try to explain my question as good as I can, dont hesitate to correct me because Im a beginner.p  pIm using Qt to design a GUI to control a 3D engine. Qt and the 3D engine talk together using a QTcpserver. I can send command to the 3D engine like move object or list objects in scene and the engine will answer.p  pCurrently, there is 2 problems 1 When the server respond, I cannot know if that is the response from a move function or for a list function. I parse the answer to launch event on the GUI, but thats not a proper solution. 2 Before sending a command, I call the waitForReadyRead function, which is blocking the main thread. Thats why Im posting here.p  pI thought about a solution a Thread which contains a List of command and pointer on the function to call next. When I click on a UI button, it sends the command to the list whith the right function pointer and the Thread will try to empty the list sending command to the server.p  pBut I really dont know if its the good way to resolve my problem. I dont know much about QTcpServer and QThread, I read many articles where they are used together to handle multiple client connection but that didnt help me.p  pI didnt post code here because I dont think my question is code related but I would be happy to do so if you ask me for.p  pThanks for pointing me the right direction.p

Negative 1190 pIm currently working in a project where I must take a Fibonacci algorithm high level description C and transform it in a RTL module written in VHDL. To do so, one would need to transform such high level description in synthetizable VHDL code, i.e., one would have to write a VHDL code for a datapath and a finite state machine FSM, in a methodology widely known in IC prototyping. p  pI described the datapath and the FSM in two separate files and instanciated them in a third as VHDL COMPONENTs, defining the Fibonacci module. Using the Quartus II software, Analysis amp Synthesis succeeds with no erros and with the very annoying warning Warning 13024 Output pins are stuck at VCC or GND. What makes this warning truly annoying is that it shows up for the most crucial output of the Fibonacci module, wich is its final result. This output is called do in my code.p  pThe datao output pin comes from the datapath component, wich is also descripted using COMPONENTs such as adders, subtractors, registers and multiplexers.

Negative 1190 pI have successfully set up a Vagrant environment to put my laravel application with all its dependencies, as well as configuring the web server as required. I set this up using ubuntu. p  pThe problem that I have is the appstorage folder. I noticed that the first time I loaded the site, it gave me an error with permissions. I then ran ap  precodechmod R arwx appstorage codepre  p... And that made me load my file properly. When I refreshed, I got a blank screen. p  pI ran chmod once again, and I had access to my mainpage once again. p  pI tested my routes only to come with the problem that my application randomly crashed. Running chmod yet again solved this. p  pI came to the conclusion that my problem is related with group ownership and not so much permissions themselves, because files are being created constantly on the appstorage folder and they are not being created with permissions. p  pHow can I add write permissions to the appstorage folder so everytime new files are made, will have the permissions I needp

Negative 1190 pWe have a PHP based timesheet system thats been developed in house, and has evolved over the years, however one piece of information presented to the users is the number of working days remaining on each project.p  pCurrently, I simply take the difference between the current date and project end date, and divide by 7 and multiply by 5. This has sufficed for a long time and is mostly accurate enough for staff that work full time Monday to Friday. However, we now have a number of staff who work only the odd day a week.p  pThe timesheet system is aware of what days which staff work, this information is stored in a string in the user class, for a full time worker, the value would be codeNNYYYYYcode meaning codessMTWTFcode.p  pI could very easily make the result more accurate, by dividing the difference between the two dates by seven, and then multiplying by the number of days they work, but whilst making this change, Im considering producing a much more accurate means of calculating the real value.p  pThe easiest way that springs to mind would be to just use a loop between the two dates, comparing the day of the week to the users working pattern, adding one to a counter on days where the user works that day.p  pGiven that this calculation has to be performed on average about 30 times per page view due to the number of projects on the timesheet and projects can span 12 or 18 months at a time thats a lot of looping for every page load, Im wondering if theres a more efficient method of doing this in PHPp

Negative 1190 pI have just finished porting a decent amount of csources to the iOS platform and packaged them as a universal static framework.  I, then, added the framework not the project to a sample iOS app in order to test linkage and proper function.  Thats when I ran into a humbling problem.p  pIn my attempt to solve the problem described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23623223linkerreportsadifferentsetofundefinedsymbolsinaniosstaticlibraryfraherea, I also came across some symbols that are composed through the heavy use of macros i HATE those.  Some of those macros use function attributes that are really extensions of gcc rather than of standard C.p  pOf course I can always add stdgnu89, but even then, I am not sure it will resolve the original problem of undefined symbols in the static library.p  pNot only that, I am now worried that my port to iOS of those sources may not be an accurate port and may result in the type of bugsissues that maybe related to compilers codeine andor optimization policies.p  pIf you can share some of your experienceadvice in how best to go about that port, I would really appreciate it.p  pThanksp

Negative 1190 pI need to create a scheduler for tasks. While creating any schedule, you can give the start date and end date of the schedule. You can also add an employee to the schedule.  However, if for an employee, the newly created schedule conflicts with the already existing schedule, the system should split the date range into available dates and schedule the task. p  pFor egp  blockquote   pSchedule 1 Jan10 to Jan 20  Added employee E1 to Schedule 1. Now   schedule 2 is created which runs from Jan 1 Jan 25 and adding the   same employee,E1 to this schedule. While saving, the system should   split the date as Jan 1Jan 9 and Jan 21Jan 25.  Similar way, if   another schedule for the same employee is the date range of Jan 22Jan   29, it should split the range as Jan 25  Jan 29.p blockquote  pWhat is the best way to achieve this in Java  p  pThe logic I can now think of p  pWhen a new schedule comes, iterate through all the previous schedules and compare the date ranges and split the date based on the availabilitywith for loops.

Negative 1190 pIm maintaining a website that seems to be generating a lot of connection dropped errors in the HttpErr logs.  Im trying to match up the errors in the HttpErr logs with log entries in the IIS logs, to see what additional information I can glean eg time taken, response status code.p  pIm having trouble matching up records in the HttpErr logs with the corresponding requests in the IIS logs.  Although I can see requests from the same IP address in both logs, there seems to be no exact match between the timestamps in the two logs.  As a result I cant be sure if a request in the IIS log corresponds to an error in the HttpErr log, or whether they represent two different requests to the same page by the same user.  p  pMy question is Will requests that appear as connection dropped errors in the HttpErr logs also appear in the IIS logs  Or is it an eitheror situation, where a request that has the connection dropped is logged to HttpErr but one that completes without the connection being dropped is logged to the IIS logsp  pIve had a look at the httpLogging element in the ApplicationHost.config and that has no selectiveLogging attribute.  I understand that to mean IIS should log all requests by default.  However, does all really mean every single request, including those where the connection has been droppedp

Negative 1190 pIm facing a really strange problem comparing integer in Javascript. I have an array of numbers and I want to strongcheck if the current number in a loop is smaller than the previous onestrong. To do so, I save the current number as previous, so I can check them in the next loop. The function runs as expected, EXCEPT every time the current and the previous number have a different number of digits in this case, the code doesnt see the actually smaller number as being smaller than the previous one.p  pFor examplep  precode111 lt 120  gt YES  106 lt 111  gt YES  98 lt 106   gt NO  76 lt 98    gt YES  5 lt 76     gt NO codepre  pIm unable to find anything strange in the code Im using, as it is quite simplep  precodeforvar j0jltarrScores.lengthj      ifarrScores[j][0] lt scoreAnt              console.logSmaller           scoreAnt  arrScores[j][0]  codepre  pIve tried using codeparseIntcode in both values, but nothing changes... Checking the length of both numbers using codescoreAnt.toString.lengthcode returns a length of 1, no matter which number it is 100, 34 or 156798, and the same for codearrScores[j][0]code. Ive also logged the whole thing to check that the numbers are the expected ones, and they are the numbers used in the example are some of the ones Im using...p  pAny clue on what can be happening Im really lost with this, becuase it makes no sense for me...p  pThanks in advance for your time and effort p

Negative 1190 pI was trying to create a timer that depends on the system clock. That means when the system time changes it should affect the expiry of this timer too. So I thought, creating a timer based on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3523442differencebetweenclockrealtimeandclockmonotonicCLOCKREALTIMEa should do the trick. But when this timer is armed to expire after 60 sec and when I advanced the system clock by 32 sec using date command, the timer expired exactly after 60 sec. It didnt expire 32 sec earlier.p  pSo I calculated the time elapsed for CLOCKREALTIME and CLOCKMONOTONIC clocks between the 2 timer expiry. It showed 92 secs for CLOCKREALTIME and 60 sec for CLOCKMONOTONIC, which made me surprised that a timer based on CLOCKREALTIME didnt look for system clock changes.

Negative 1190 pI have a difficult question to you, which im struggeling on for some time now.p  pIm looking for a solution, where i can save a file to the users computer, without the local storage, because local storage has 5MB limit. I want the Save to filedialog, but the data i want to save is only available in javascript and i would like to prevent sending the data back to the server and then send it again. p  pThe usecase is, that the service im working on is saving compressed and encrypted chunks of the users data, so the server has no knowledge whats in those chunks and by sending the data back to the server, this would cause 4 times traffic and the server is receiving the unencrypted data, which would render the whole encryption useless.p  pI found a javascript function to save the data to the users computer with the Save to filedialog, but the work on this has been discontinued and isnt fully supported. Its this a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRfilewriterapi relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgTRfilewriterapiap  pSo since i have no window.saveAs, what is the way to save data from a Blobobject without sending everything to the serverp  pWould be great if i could get a hint, what to search for.p  pI know that this works, because MEGA is doing it, but i want my own solution   p

Negative 1190 pI want to build on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25560991blockingcollectionprocessnitemsatatimecontinuingassoonas1isdone25563554thisa question.p  pSo far I have got a way to process jobs in parallel. Im running this in a console app. I get say 50 jobs from db, process them using codeTPL DataFlowcode and so far so good. But I realized that if there is a job that takes an hour to process and rest of the jobs get done in 15 minutes, the console application will keep going for an hour without processing any further jobs. I cant change this to a windows service so I have to make the console application process new jobs coming in, may be check every 15 minutes.p  pI could kick off a timer that checks for new jobs every 15 minutes. If there is any new job in the db, I will need to add to the codebuffer blockcode so codeactionblockcode can process it. The problem is that after you add the first 50 jobs, you have to call complete and completion.wait for buffer and action blocks. So I cant add anymore new jobs to the existing buffer.p  pI could check the current codeactionblockscode isCompleted property and then create another combination of codebufferactionblockcode dynamically. Basically the condition is if the current codeactionblockcode is still going, check for new jobs on a codetimercode and create a new codebufferactionblockcode combination. This is what I plan on doing. But before I go down that path, is there another approach I can take to handle thisp

Negative 1190 pI have several Asterisk boxes and 2 kamailio  servers both for failover loadbalancing calls between Asterisk boxes. Kamailio server receives calls from E1 to SIP gateways, and then forwards the call to the Asterisk cluster. There is no NAT, and the platform only processes inbound calls.p  pAt this point, load balancing for Asterisk servers is OK Asterisk cluster handles several thousand simultaneous calls without any problem, and if i want to have more calls, i just need to setup a new Asterisk server and set its IP address to Kamailios dispatcher. Regarding Kamailio, the failover cluster if we can call it cluster, as there are only 2 serves works perfectly. p  pBut as any hightech solution, there are limits we cannot grow the Asterisk cluster indefinitely, so at some point, well need to add more Kamailio servers. Knowing that the E1toSIP gateway redirect calls to only 1 IP address the kamailio cluster address, question isp  pHow can we add any number of new Kamailio servers to thep platform, and loadbalancing SIP requests between kamailio cluster p  pgrossomodo, how to load balance load balancers p  pI thought about Kamailio  LVS integration. Any clues, anyonep

Negative 1190 pIm working on an OSX app where I want to create calendar events, add some attendees, add the event to the user Calendar, and send an invitation to the attendees. First I thought I could use the Eventkit framework, but for some reason you cant add attendees to an event created by Eventkit. Instead I create an .ics file see example below. I can add the .ics file to the Calendar and send it as an attachment in a mail as an invitation. The attendee can add it to his own Calendar and select accept in the rsvp section. However, the organizer never receives his acceptance. I have no idea how to get this to work and havent been able to locate any examples.

Negative 1190 pI have to insert an odd number by terminal. After this, it generates two processes, A and B. Then it sends codeSIGUSR2code signal to B, and his handler prints the reciprocal of the codeargv[1]code. Then, B sleeps for codeargv[1]code seconds and sends codeSIGUSR1code signal to A process before terminating. The codeSIGUSR1code handler for process A prints something and then terminates. The problem is that codeSIGUSR1code handler for process A doesnt work because the signal couldnt be sent by codeSIGUSR2code handler for process B. In fact, the codekillA,SIGUSR1code tells that there is no such process for process A. After setting the signal handler in process A, it is in codepausecode.

Negative 1190 pIm building an app for iOS using the Swift language.

Negative 1190 pIve looked around but couldnt find any solutions, so this is my last resort.p  pIm working on a XamarinAndroid project and Ive got a viewpager with one fragment. The trick with this fragment is that even though its only one fragment, it loads many instances of this one fragment, depending on how many I need but the problem is that each fragment needs to load one object one set of data. The problem I have is that when I iterate through the list of returned items loaded from a file, it obviously loops through everything and sets the last set of returned data onto my fragment. This causes me to have many fragments with the same data. What I need is to load one set of data onto each fragment instead of it loading the last set onto my fragment. So in essence, I have one fragment which loads many instances and each instance needs to show one objects data. How do I do thisp  pThanks in advance for any assistance.p  pOkay, please see below  This is the fragment class. Ive left out the OnCreateView of the fragment, as it only inflates the fragment resource and gets the textviews etc. Let me know if you need the FragmentPagerAdapter code as well. This one fragment has many instances, which is set in the FragmentPagerAdapter class in the Count and GetItem overidden methods. Count returns the number of instances required and GetItem which does return ThisFragment.newInstancepositionp  pEDIT Code updated with solutionp  precodeprivate int mNum private string code, status TextView textviewMyObjectCode, textviewMyObjectStatus  public static ThisFragment newInstanceint num      ThisFragment myFragment  new ThisFragment     MyObject myObject  new MyObject      ListltMyObjectgt myObjectList  MyObjectIO.LoadMyObjectsFromFile      myObject.MyObjectNumber  myObjectList[num].MyObjectNumber     myObject.MyObjectStatus  myObjectList[num].MyObjectStatus      args.PutIntnum, num     args.PutStringobjectCode, myObject.MyObjectNumber     args.PutStringobjectStatus, myObject.MyObjectStatus      myFragment.Arguments  args      return thisFragment   public override void OnCreateBundle savedInstanceState      base.OnCreatesavedInstanceState     mNum  Arguments  null  Arguments.GetIntnum  1     code  Arguments.GetStringobjectCode     status  Arguments.GetStringobjectStatus                 public override View OnCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState             if container  null                  return null                 View thisView  inflater.InflateResource.Layout.objectfragment, container, false         textviewObjectStatus  thisView.FindViewByIdltTextViewgtResource.Id.textviewObjectStatus        textviewObjectCode  thisView.FindViewByIdltTextViewgtResource.Id.textviewObjectCode         textviewObjectCode.Text  code        textviewObjectStatus.Text  status         return thisView     codepre

Negative 1190 pMy code has a user mode mapping set up via mmap which I need to flush after writing to it from the CPU but before I dispatch the data by  DMAing the underlying physical memory.  Also I need to invalidate the cache after data has arrived via a DMA to the underlying physical memory but before I attempt to read from it with the CPU.p  pIn my mind cache flushing and cache invalidating mean two different things.  Roughly cache flushing means writing whats in the cache out to memory or simply cache data goes to memory whereas cache invalidating means subsequently assuming all cache contents are stale so that any attempts to read from that range will provoke a fresh read from memory or simply memory data goes to cache.p  pHowever in the kernel I do not find two calls but instead just one  flushcacherange.p  pThis is the API I use for both tasks and it seems to work at least it has up until the present issue Im trying to debug.p  pThis is possibly because the behavior of  flushcacherange just emmightem be to 1  First write any dirty cache entries to memory THEN 2  Invalidate all cache entriesp  pIF is this is what this API really does then my use of it in this role is justified.  After all its how I myself might implement it.  The precise question for which I seek a confident answer isp  pIS that in fact how  flushcacherange actually worksp

Negative 1190 pI have a fairly simple Rails app running on Heroku where end users can upload two photos and receive a link to the photo via email and SMS.p  pThe app was originally running Paperclip in realtime and timing out sometimes because of Herokus 30second limit. I switched to jQuery Upload and S3 to upload the images prior to hitting submit to create the customer, with Paperclip as a delayed job after the fact. This works perfectly  except it continues to time out upon create, and when I look in the lower left of my browser it says Uploading XX as though it is uploading the alreadyuploaded files upon create. I am pulling my hair out.p  pAgain, the photos load fine to S3. On a fast connection, this does not time out, and everything works fine. On a slower connection, it times out upon hitting Submit on the form after images are uploaded successfully.p  pCode below.

Negative 1190 pI am developing a webapplication, and want to use lazy loading in the models.

Negative 1190 pWe have a PHP webApp that were writing an Android app for. Our site allows you to login via FB and we store the users info in our DB, email, fbid, etc. Next time they log in, we verify that information and then let him proceed. We trust this information since its coming to a callback only accessible to Facebook.p  pHowever, now that were trying to create the Android app, even though were using SSL how can we trust the information that were getting to actually be of that user For instance, if I know the FB id and email address of a user, I can make the same request to the same end point. The session access token I dont believe will help because it is temporary so cant be stored in the DB.  Am I missing something here p

Negative 1190 pI have an angular project Im working on containerizing. It currently has enough build tooling that a frontend developer could and this is how it currently works just run gulp in the project root, edit source files in src, and the build tooling handles running traceur, templates and libsass and so forth, spitting content into a build directory. That build directory is served with a minimal server in development, and handled by nginx in production.p  pMy goal is to build a dockerbased environment that replicates this workflow. My users are developers who are on different kinds of boxes, so having build dependencies frozen in a dockerfile seems to make sense.p  pIve gotten close enough to this docker mounts the host volume, the developer edits the file on the local disk, and the gulp build watcher is running in the docker container instance and rebuilds the site and triggers livereload, etc etc.p  pThe issue I have is with wrapping my head around how filesystem layers work. Is this process of rebuilding files in the containers buildfrontend directory generating a ton of extraneous saved layers Thats not something Id really like, because Im not wild about monotonically growing this instance as developers tweak and rebuild and tweak and rebuild. Itd only grow locally, but having to go through the okay, time to clean up and start over process seems tedious.p

Negative 1190 pHello We are trying to create a custom template system based such as WPF Header and Footer elements, with a canvas for 2D Drawings for export to PDF. The problem is the XpsWriter takes about 7 seconds to write the XPS Document, and another 3 Seconds to convert to pdf with PDFSharp.  We need to get this down as the user waits for the PDF.

Negative 1190 pI have an app I am working to recreate in angular. One section is a list of items that currently has 140 different items. Each item has a table with 14 rows, and differing numbers of columns usually 620.p  pThe way the information works, we really need to show all the items to start. However, the processing time to render the tables using ngrepeat, as well as the massively exponential number of scopes is prohibitive, especially since some users will have older computers although likely running FF or Chrome, so Im not worried about IE issues. p  pI have all the data locally in a json array, and I can format it as needed. Of course, there is filtering, so things will be shownhidden all over. But the data in the tables is one time bound, and doesnt change.p  pId really prefer to make this something that is in a template. I could either loop it in a javascript array, or create the table data myself that way. However, in angular, templates are not allowed to have logic, so I cant do that. p  pId prefer to do everything rendering client side for speed, so Id prefer not to have to call up the server to render it.p  pI could also prerender it in the json, and use sanitize I believe, but that seems back door and against the separation of interests which is core to angular.p  pWhat would be the best practices in this case I think Ive tried about everything, and nothing within angular seems perfomant enough for this case. Id prefer not to have to use paging, since the users would want to scroll multiple filtered long lists.

Negative 1190 pin this code, I am creating two threads joystick and motor. The intention of the joystick thread is to ask the user to input a certain speed integer value for eg. 200. From my understanding, this integer value must be converted to a string inorder for the motor thread to receive this string value and convert it back to an integer value, before passing it into my application.p  pThe result of the compiled code in GCC is my motor application receives a speed of zero despite a user input of any other numbers, and hence, it is not moving.

Negative 1190 pstrongorg.apache.log4j.Hierarchystrong contains a hashtable named stronghtstrong that keeps growing and growing until we hit an emOutOfMemoryErrorem in our application server.p  pstronghtstrong has several millions entries and I do not understand why.p  pSeveral categories are defined in the log4.properties, and i would expect to have entries in this hashtable ONCE for each class matching a category definition.p  pBut each time a new instance of some class is created, a new logger is added in this hashtable ..  As a consequence, we do not control its size and it grows until it completely saturates the JVM.p  pAny ideas  Is there any configuration to avoid this behaviour  Should we clear this ht regularly  p  pUsing jmap histo clearly shows this constant evolution ..p

Negative 1190 pIm trying to take the elaborate filtering and deleting that I have to do every day when dealing with a raw data report and reduce as much of it as I can down to a single button click.p  pI believe I have done most of this through a simple recorded macro seen below but it will sometimes leave in certain entries for items that I want deleted. Looking at the code I believe this could be down to the fact that as the macro is applying filters the starting rows it looks for when attempting to delete content arent fixed. So my question is, should I just use Offset values based on the row that currently holds the filter Or would this not work as wellp  pThe Issues are arising when Im deleting the Criteria POR ltBGR and

Next model is PropertyValue where is stored specific colors or sizes which is belongs to Property. p  precodeclass Product lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany properties   hasmany propertyvalues, through properties end  class Property lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto product   hasmany propertyvalues end  class PropertyValues lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto property end codepre  pI have already created in every model properties and property values for each property. My idea is that when I will be product edit I will use nestedform. There will be select box for each property. I will select property value XL from property select and then I will add it to product.p  pI hope that this is achievable, but Im lost in that now. I tried many solutions with models but still cant find the right solution. Thank you for all hints and sorry for poor english.p

My function looks something like thisp  precodefunction mycolor color, variant standard, adjust null      color mapgetmycolors, color    color mapgetcolor, variant    if adjust  color scalecolorcolor, lightness adjust    return color  codepre  pThis can then be called with something like codemycolorgreencode or codemycolorgreen, standard, 10code.p  pHowever as the above codemycolorscode map shows, Im trying to selfreference the map to create variants of colours and keep my code DRY. So for some colours, like coderedcode or codebluecode, I have two specific hex colours from our brand guidelines. But for codegreencode, we just have the standard green. So to make a variant I want to find our standard green, and make it a bit darker. p  pThe simplest fix is to just hard code the hex colours twice, and use Sass codescalecolorcode function. But this would mean our code is no longer DRY. Ultimately if there is no fix this isnt the biggest problem as we shouldnt be changing these variables often, but if possible it would be nice to keep it DRY so I know this will always work and doesnt need to be changed twice.p  pIf anyone has any thoughts on how this could be done better Id love to hear them.p

Negative 1190 pI started to look into creating a specific ESmapping for tweets, but quickly realized that an ESmapping of the tweetmodel would become a nightmare to maintain over time so I started to think about dynamic templates. Ive registered a dynamic template for every possible property according to the twitter object description. A tweet is a very hierarchical and redundant format which means that a property, say createdat, may be present at a number of places  thus the nightmare to maintain a stable explicit mapping.p  pIn the mapping Ive created so far I have strongnostrong explicit mappings propertiesattribute is empty as I want strongallstrong the mappings to be controlled by dynamic templates. As an example my dynamic template for the createdat property looks likep  precode     createdat      match createdat,     mapping          format EEE MMM d HHmmss Z YYYY,         index no       codepre  pI thought that having this template would take care of the mapping of a createdat property whereever it would appear in the jsonstructure. I know that I may specify pathmatch in order to explicitly specify a give propertyinstance but I want strongallstrong the createdat attributes to be mapped according to the template above.p  pHowever  when I start indexing data into ES I get numerous errors looking something likep  precodeCaused by org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException unknown property [createdat]     at org.elasticsearch.index.mapper.core.StringFieldMapper.parseCreateFieldForStringStringFieldMapper.java331     at org.elasticsearch.index.mapper.core.StringFieldMapper.parseCreateFieldStringFieldMapper.java277     at org.elasticsearch.index.mapper.core.AbstractFieldMapper.parseAbstractFieldMapper.java399     ... 13 more codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong herep

Negative 1190 pIm currently experiencing some weird effect with codegcccode tested version 4.8.4.p  pIve got a performance oriented code, which runs pretty fast. Its speed depends for a large part on inlining many small functions.p  pSince inlining across multiple code.ccode files is difficult codefltocode is not yet widely available, Ive kept a lot of small functions typically 1 to 5 lines of code each into a common C file, into which Im developing a codec, and its associated decoder. Its relatively large by my standard about 2000 lines, although a lot of them are just comments and blank lines, but breaking it into smaller parts opens new problems, so I would prefer to avoid that, if that is possible.p  pEncoder and Decoder are related, since they are inverse operations. But from a programming perspective, they are completely separated, sharing nothing in common, except a few typedef and very lowlevel functions such as reading from unaligned memory position.p  pThe strange effect is this onep  pI recently added a new function codefnewcode to the encoder side. Its a new entry point. Its not used nor called from anywhere within the code.ccode file.p  pThe simple fact that it exists makes the performance of the emdecoderem function codefdeccode drops substantially, by more than 20, which is way too much to be ignored.p  pNow, keep in mind than encoding and decoding operations are completely separated, and share almost nothing, save some minor codetypedefcode codeu32code, codeu16code and such and associated operations readwrite.p  pWhen defining the new encoding function codefnewcode as codestaticcode, performance of the decoder codefdeccode increases back to normal. Since codefnewcode isnt called from the code.ccode, I guess its the same as if it was not there dead code elimination.p  pIf codestatic fnewcode is now called from the encoder side, performance of codefdeccode remains strong.p  pBut as soon as codefnewcode is modified, codefdeccode performance just drops substantially.p  pPresuming codefnewcode modifications crossed a threshold, I increased the following codegcccode parameter codeparam maxinlineinsnsauto60code by default, its value is supposed to be 40. And it worked  performance of codefdeccode is now back to normal.p  pAnd I guess this game will continue forever with each little modification of codefnewcode or anything else similar, requiring further tweak.p  pThis is just plain weird. There is no logical reason for some little modification in function codefnewcode to have knockon effect on completely unrelated function codefdeccode, which only relation is to be in the same file.p  pThe only tentative explanation I could invent so far is that maybe the simple presence of codefnewcode is enough to cross some kind of codeglobal file thresholdcode which would impact codefdeccode. codefnewcode can be made not present when its 1. not there, 2. codestaticcode but not called from anywhere 3. codestaticcode and small enough to be inlined. But its just hiding the problem. Does that mean I cant add any new functionp  pReally, I couldnt find any satisfying explanation anywhere on the net.p  pI was curious to know if someone already experienced some equivalent sideeffect, and found a solution to it.p  pem[Edit]emp  pLets go for some more crazy test. Now Im adding emanotherem completely useless function, just to play with. Its content is strictly exactly a copypaste of codefnewcode, but the name of the function is obviously different, so lets call it codewtfcode.p  pWhen codewtfcode exists, it doesnt matter if codefnewcode is static or not, nor what is the value of codemaxinlineinsnsautocode performance of codefdeccode is back to normal. Even though codewtfcode is not used nor called from anywhere... p  pem[Edit 2]em  there is no codeinlinecode instruction. All functions are either normal or codestaticcode. Inlining decision is solely within compilers realm, which has worked fine so far.p  pem[Edit 3]em As suggested by Peter Cordes, the issue is not related to inline, but to instruction alignment. On newer Intel cpus Sandy Bridge and later, hot loop benefit from being aligned on 32bytes boundaries. Problem is, by default, codegcccode align them on 16bytes boundaries. Which gives a 50 chance to be on proper alignment depending on length of previous code. Hence a difficult to understand issue, which looks random.p  pNot all loop are sensitive. It only matters for critical loops, and only if their length make them cross one more 32bytes instruction segment when being less ideally aligned.p
