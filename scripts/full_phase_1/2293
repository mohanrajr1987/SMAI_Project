Positive 2293 pI think Apples RAW processor is nice but honestly there are far better. Capture One Pro, Dxo Optics, Adobe Camera Raw, Nikon Capture NX2  they all create a much more pleasing output image.p  pIm thinking about the possibilities of Apples Photos Extensions introduced in OS X El Capitan, but I have yet to see any documentation that says if an extension can get access to the actual RAW data. PHAssetMediaType and PHAssetMediaSubType do not have an enum for a RAW image, only JPEG, Video etc..p  pIf Photos can provide the actual RAW bits to a Photos Extension, this opens up the door to become the perfect DAM along with iCloud Photos Library.p  pJust to be clear  I am fully aware that an extension can get a translated RAW file as input, the question is does Apple Photos first convert that RAW file into JPEG and provide the JPEG as input, or can Apple Photos send the actual RAW bits as input.p

Positive 2293 pPlease correct me if Im wrong, but from what I understand with Swift 2.0 Apple really encourage you against having many catch statements to handle different error types. Instead in most cases your docatch block would have only one catch statement that catches everything.p  pIm not saying that this is a good or bad idea. But I just dont see any other option. You cant be 100 sure about error type that you may or may not receive after a function call. This is because there is no way to specify a list of possible errors in a function definition after throws statement. So you would need to dig into the call stack of the function to find this out. And this could be a very deep stack... Will anyone actually do this every time just to get the idea what to catchp  pTo demonstrate what I meanp  precodefunc funcA throws       throw SomeError    func funcB throws       if something           throw OtherError            try funcA   func funcX throws       try funcB  codepre  pNow I if I want to call funcX  I dont really know that it can throw SomeError or OtherError by looking at funcX definition. In order to find this out I will need to go and review the entire call stack tree from funcX. While it doesnt look too complex in the extremely short example above. But in a real world source code this may become an issue.p

I am now familiar with this process and now want to create a Java class representing the XML file, so that when a user instantiates a new object of that class, all of the data from the XML file will be available.p  pTo illustrate this I have an XML file, called MyConfig.xml, with the following structurep  precodeltMyConfiggt     ltServerNamegtnileltServerNamegt     ltServerPortgt8079ltServerPortgt ltMyConfiggt codepre  pI also have a Java class, called MyConfig.java, that represents this XML file.

Negative 2293 pI am working on a game using the XNA framework.  My game has several levels which I am storing the data in a plain old text file.

Negative 2293 pstrongRewrittenstrongp  pI could use some input, suggestions, and samples from some other minds on building a databindable collection.p  pThe collection needs to provide a databindable, strongeditablestrong tree of items, but with a small twist the items need to be one of two types, with each type providing slightly different characteristics.  The two types of items are Folder and TreeItem.  A Folder contains its own list of items again, either of Folder or TreeItem type and a TreeItem does not contain a list.p  pMy current approach is fairly close, but feels crufty.  Essentially I have an abstract base class, TreeItemBase, which in a roundabout way inherits from BindableList.  Then I have two concrete derived types, Folder and TreeItem which both inherit from the abstract base class.  The obvious flaw is that the TreeItem, which cant contain childitems, still inherits from BindingList so its up to some ugly hackery to pretend that its not a collection.p  pIs BindingListlt a poor choice to base this collection on  Some of the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary41e17s4b28loband29.aspx relnofollowDataBinding interfacesa sound like they offer a higher degree of control over the databinding, but I havent found one thats quite right.  My emidealem though is to provide a custom implementation that lets me control how databinding walks the collection and can inspect the concrete type of each element to determine if it contains a collection, or if its a terminus in the tree.p  pHeres a quick cut of the XML to help visualize what Im trying to represent its easy for me to cleanly code the structure and rules in XSDbut Im just having a hard time translating it to .NET and supporting databinding.p  precodeltItemsgt   ltTreeItem xsitypeFolder nameRootgt     ltTreeItem xsitypeFolder nameSub1gt       ltTreeItem xsitypeTreeItem nameHummgt     ltTreeItemgt     ltTreeItem xsitypeTreeItem nameBlehgt     ltTreeItem xsitypeFolder nameSub2gt       ltTreeItem xsitypeTreeItem nameBoogt     ltTreeItemgt   ltTreeItemgt ltItemsgt codepre  pstrongUpdatestrong Ive been working more on my approach and have come close to what Id like to do using an interface rather than a baseclass for the items, but have hit a snag.  The issue Ive run into is covered on a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1295000netwinformsdatabindingbindinglistibindableitemwheresomeimplementationsseperate questiona.p  pIdeally Id like to use the abstract baseclass approach so that the XML thats generated considers codeFoldercode and codeTreeItemcode to be complexTypes without manual control of the serialization, but its a negligible requirement.p

Negative 2293 pSimple question Am I wrong in reccomending against Wordpress SEOsp  pNow, I dont want to start a flame war or anything like that, but Im just curious if my viewpoint is consistent with other developers  hosts out there.  I work at a small company, and we specialize in Microsoftbased hosting and CMS solutions, particularly a popular opensource CMS system that runs on ASP.NET. p  pHowever, Ive recently seen a significant jump in the amount of my clients who are being approached by SEO companies that are promising them the world on SERPs rankings. The catch is that these SEO Experts are all requiring that the sites have Wordpress installed on our servers so they can work their magic.  p  pTo add insult to injury, many of these approached sites I have constantly made SEO recommendations to along whitehat SEO lines  quality, keywordrich, content that is updated frequently along with a good network of inbound links and semantic markup. In comparison, sites that follow our design and content recommendations regardless of backend technology are ranking in the top 510 organically based upon targeted search phrases. However, it seems there is a significant increase in these Wordpress SEOs recently.p  pNow, Im not trying to slam PHP or Wordpress at least not intentionally, however to me I am a bit hesitant to allow some third parties access to my servers when there have been several PHP  Wordpress vulnerabilities recently and I just dont trust these flybynighters. The common theme Ive seen is that they will install one version, and be done with it, regardless of released updates to address vulnerabilities. I also am still of the opinion that while PHP emcanem be secure when implemented correctly, there are more PHP developers that write very sloppy code and leave holes open because they dont know any better  I had one that enabled Global Variables somehow, which nearly took down an entire server when their site was exploited. p  pSo, am I being overly paranoid about this I hate telling my customers no but it seems to put a lot more work on our end to keep up with all of our current issues, and then have to also monitor any Wordpress  PHP issues that may crop up as well. I also am not a fan of maintaining or having to update Wordpress installs for someone else.p  pTo me, it seems that many of these Wordpress SEOs are just people who are only familiar with Wordpress, and refuse to use any other system.  I always get this picture in my head of someone who read a Get rich on the Internet being an SEO book and this is the result. However, I am open to any opinions  discussion as to why Wordpress may be superior for SEO placement  aside from its easy for idiots, which I already know.p  pAm I being unreasonable here, or is this a reasonable concernp

Negative 2293 pIve written an application for Google AppEngine, and Id like to make use of the memcache API to cut down on perrequest CPU time. Ive profiled the application and found that a large chunk of the CPU time is in template rendering and API calls to the datastore, and after chatting with a coworker I jumped perhaps a bit early to the conclusion that caching a chunk of a pages rendered HTML would cut down on the CPU time per request significantly. The caching pattern is pretty clean, but the question of emwhereem to put this logic of caching and evicting is a bit of a mystery to me.p  pFor example, imagine an applications main page has an Announcements section. This section would need to be rerendered afterp  ul lifirst read for anyone in the account,li lia new announcement being added, andli lian old announcement being deletedli ul  pSome options of where to put the codeevictannouncementssectionfromcachecode method callp  ul liin the Announcement Models code.deletecode, and code.putcode methodsli liin the RequestHandlers code.postcode methodli lianywhere elseli ul  pThen in the RequestHandlers get page, I could potentially call codegetannouncementssectioncode which would follow the standard memcache pattern check cache, add to cache on miss, return value and pass that HTML down to the template for that chunk of the page.p  pIs it the typical design pattern to put the cacheevicting logic in the Model, or the ControllerRequestHandler, or somewhere else Ideally Id like to avoid having evicting logic with tentacles all over the code.p

Negative 2293 pIs it generally acceptable that one repository can access another repository  Specifically in this case, I have one aggregate root that uses another aggregate root to determine what entities to add.  It falls along the lines of an ItemItem Type relationship.  The reason that the Item Type is an aggregate root is that they are separately maintainable within a management tool outside of the scope of any single Item.p  pIf it does matter, I am only creating my repository instances through a repository factory implementation, so I am not directly creating it by the concrete class name.  At no time is the aggregate aware of the repository.p  pstrongEdit  More informationstrongp  pThe specific implementation is that we can attach images to a document.  Not only can we manage the images on the document, but there are different types of images types being defined as how it is implemented, as opposed to an extension, for example.  The document aggregate is one of a few types of other objects in the system that use these images and they do not all use the same types.  While we do attach rules in the domain services, this is more specifically geared towards building the document aggregate.  When building the aggregate we have five images of a specific type, and one each of two other types.  We pull these individually because they are stored in separate lists in the aggregate.  The validation is not the issue, but limiting what type of images are being evaluated when assembling the document.p

Im getting two values from each sprite as it iterates through, would it be more efficient faster to iterate through an array of say CGPoints then an array of sprites Or instead of CGPoint make a custom class for the sole purpose of handling just two integer values. Either way, is speed affected by the type of objects or values stored in an arrayp

Negative 2293 pI want to make a form in which I want to automatically give focus to a field.

I have to tell the controller or in some cases a specific subview up the chain that an item was selected.p  pListening to notifications would be an option, but I dont like that solution because selecting an item is not a global event.

Is the embedded environment a special case of general computing in the eyes of functional programming or is it just another form of the general case Is the challenge all in the IO My embedded work usually entails about 90  95 peripheral IO work and the last little bit of stuff being what algorithm work I can fit onto it and still make it back to my IO in time. Does that sort of work make a functional program unsuited to my needsp  pFinally, if there are any projects to embedded Haskell projects you could suggest, thatd be greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 2293 pIm working with a large code base with a huge number of projects, each of which has a handful and in some cases, enormous amount of references to others.

The ones for files that are finished use a different icon instead of the activity indicator and hide the progressview. p  pThis table is using a NSFetchedResultsController as data source, so I get the updates on the data model and update the content.p  pEverything works just fine. The problem, however, is performance. Every time I call strongreloadDatastrong my UIActivityIndicators flicker, and its not very smooth. Although Im caching from the nib file, strongreloadDatastrong will have to calculate the new progress  for the ProgressView and I dont do anything with the ActivityIndicator other than hiding it if upload is complete.p  pAnybody ever tried something similar Is there a workaround p  pI was thinking about having an array of my progressview references and use that instead of calling reloadData.. not sure if this is the correct approach.p  pThanks,p  pFernandop

Negative 2293 pAs of late, I have been pondering heavily about the best way to Mock a static method that is called from a class that I am trying to test.  Take the following code for examplep  precodeusing FileStream fStream  File.CreateCtest.txt      string text  MyUtilities.GetFormattedTexthello world     MyUtilities.WriteTextToFiletext, fStream  codepre  pI understand that this is a rather bad example, but it has three static method calls that are all different slightly. The File.Create function access the file system and I dont own that function.  The MyUtilities.GetFormattedText is a function that I own and it is purely stateless. Finally, the MyUtilities.WriteTextToFile is a function I own and it accesses the file system.p  pWhat I have been pondering lately is if this were legacy code, how could I refactor it to make it more unittestable.  I have heard several arguments that static functions should not be used because they are hard to test.  I disagree with this idea because static functions are useful and I dont think that a useful tool should be discarded just because the test framework that is being used cant handle it very well.p  pAfter much searching and deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that there are basically strong4 patterns or practicesstrong that can be used in order to make functions that call static functions unittestable.  These include the followingp  ol libDont mockb the static function at all and just let the unit test call it.li liWrap the static method in an instance class that implements an interface with the function that you need on it and then use dependency injection to use it in your class. Ill refer to this as binterface dependency injectionb.li liUse bMolesb or TypeMock to hijack the function call.li liUse dependeny injection for the function. Ill refer to this as bfunction dependency injectionb.li ol  pIve heard quite a lot of discussion about the first three practices, but as I was thinking about solutions to this problem, the forth idea came to me of strongfunction dependency injectionstrong.  This is similar to hiding a static function behind an interface, but without actually needing to create an interface and wrapper class.  An example of this would be the followingp  precodepublic class MyInstanceClass      private Actionltstring, FileStreamgt writeFunction  delegate        public MyInstanceClassActionltstring, FileStreamgt functionDependency              writeFunction  functionDependency           public void DoSomething2              using FileStream fStream  File.CreateCtest.txt                      string text  MyUtilities.GetFormattedTexthello world             writeFunctiontext, fStream                codepre  pSometimes, creating an interface and wrapper class for a static function call can be cumbersome and it can pollute your solution with a lot of small classes whose sole purpose is to call a static function.  I am all for writing code that is easily testable, but this practice seems to be a workaround for a bad testing framework.p  pAs I was thinking about these different solutions, I came to an understanding that all of the 4 practices mentioned above can be applied in different situations. Here is what I am thinking is the strongcorrect cicumstances to apply the above practicesstrongp  ol libDont mockb the static function if it is purely stateless and does not access system resources such as the filesystem or a database. Of course, the argument can be made that if system resources are being accessed then this introduces state into the static function anyway.li liUse binterface dependency injectionb when there are several static functions that you are using that can all logically be added to a single interface. The key here is that there are several static functions being used.  I think that in most cases this will not be the case.  There will probably only be one or two static functions being called in a function.li liUse bMolesb when you are mocking up external libraries such as UI libraries or database libraries such as linq to sql.  My opinion is that if Moles or TypeMock is used to hijack the CLR in order to mock your own code, then this is an indicator that some refactoring needs to be done to decouple the objects.li liUse bfunction dependency injectionb when there is a small number of static function calls in the code that is being tested.  This is the pattern that I am leaning towards in most cases in order to test functions that are calling static functions in my own utility classes.li ol  pThese are my thoughts, but I would really appreciate some feedback on this.  What is the best way to test code where an external static function is being calledp

Negative 2293 pIm working on a CRM desktop application which is going to be used by more than one agent at a time, and all agents will go through the same list of customers. What I need to do here is to avoid conflicts between agents, so once an agent selects a customer from the list, others shouldnt be able to see that row anymore, or in another words they shouldnt be able to select that customer row until the first agent is done  The simplest way that comes in mind wich may sound stupid is to add two fields LOCKBIT, LOCKEXPIRYDATETIME and manage that.

Negative 2293 pIm currently developing apps for the inPulse watch if youre a geek, check out www.GetInPulse.com and am compiling for the watch while on a Mac.

Negative 2293 pI am writing a implementing a ASP.NET web app, and when I call against a particular url, I want to call a different action method depending on whether the request is a GET or a POST.p  pIve tried two different approaches  first of all I start with a controller with the following action methodsp  precodeltHttpGetgt Public Function Index as ActionResult ... End Function  ltHttpPostgt Public Function Index as ActionResult ... End Function codepre  p... and then registering a Route which sets .action to Index for the Url. This doesnt compile, because the two functions have the same signature.p  pNext I tried changing the name of the Post routine to Subscribe, but of course that would require me to supply two different routes to the routing table so as to specify the new action method name. If I do that, I find that the second one is cancelled out by the first.p  pIm now thinking of going back to my original idea, but supplying a dummy parameter to it, and specifying it as UrlParameter.Optional. By having this as an argument in the post routine, this will create a new method signature, which I would expect would be ok.p  pIt smells a bit of a dirty hack though  so I was wondering how other people would go about itp  pMartin.p  pPs. I have now tried the dirty hack, and it does work. Still interested in hearing the views of others though.p
Negative 2293 pIm new to this concept so I might be wrong in calling it a multimodule project. In the software Im making, theres one distinct unit with distinct inputs and outputs. I decided to pull it out and run it as a separate web service since it has other values in this standalone mode.p  pBut the thing is, now the application which was previously blended with this unit has to run standalone, too. And that means there should be a new way for it to communicate with that unit by calling its service endpoints which adds new layers of complexity serializing and deserializing notsosimple data into XML and JSON.

Negative 2293 pI have N points in 3dimensional space. I need to join them using a line. However, if I do that using a simple line, it is not smooth and looks ugly.p  pMy current approach is to use a Bezier curve, using the DeCasteljau algorithm for 4 points, and running that for each group of 4 points in my data set. However, the problem with this is that since I run it on say points 14, 58, 912, etc., separately, the line is not smooth between 45, 89, etc.p  pI also looked for other approaches specifically I found a hrefhttpwww.mvps.orgdirectxarticlescatmull relnofollowthis articlea about CatmullRom splines, which seem even better suited for my purpose, because the curve passes through all control points, unlike the Bezier curve. So I almost started implementing that, but then, I saw on that site that the formula works codeassuming uniform spacing of control pointscode. That is not the case for my problem.p  pSo, my question is, what approach should I use  Bezier, CatmullRom, or something completely different If Bezier, then how to fix the nonsmoothness between 45, 89, etc. If CatmullRom, why wont the formula work if points are not evenly spaced, and what do I need insteadp  pstrongEDITstrong I am now pretty sure I want the CatmullRom spline, as it passes every control point which is an advantage for my application.

And thats it. No portlet.xml file needed any more. Just a single class configuring all my portlets.p  pOf course one could still improve this class, making it more flexible, reading the portlet package from somewhere instead of a constant. Maybe an initparam. Or one could scan for annotations, perhaps the mentioned ForPortlet annotation, which would create the possibility to register more than one bean. But for now I am happy .p

This will launch the ListView and then when the user selects an item the text of the button will become the selection.p  pstrongSolution 2strongp  pUse a spinner. The problem with this is that spinners do not support multi selection items. It would also complicate things because the items in the list view are being pulled from a server backend and displaying a loading message on top of the spinner would look ugly.p  pstrongSolution 3strongp  pHave a clickable textview which default text is Click here to select item. This will launch the ListView and then when the user selects an item the text of the textview will become the selection.p  pRight now I am implemented solution 3. The Click here to select item seems intrusive. Anyone have any ideas as to what is the best method to solve this problemp

I am drawing a custom background on drawRect, and that code DOES push the custom background to the back of the view stack, HOWEVER, this method is only being called once by the private framework methods... therefore when the bar is redrawn after the first view, the background isnt being forced back and for some stupid reason, it decides to redraw the buttons behind it.p  pSo right now I am trying to figure out how I can force the background to be pushed back every time the UINavigationBar is rendered.p

Negative 2293 pIm using a MacMini 11 with the AMD Radeon HD 6630M.  Im drawing a mesh using a structure of arrays and all is well 60 fps using CVDisplayLink.  I use a shader with builtin attributes.

The mesh is drawn beautifully. But when I do this, the frame rate drops about 33 to 40 fps. And there are multiple copies of those calls. Using InstrumentsTime Profiler, I get the following comparisonsp  precodeUsing structure of arrays 60 fps Running Time    Self    Symbol Name 3.0ms    0.0   3.0 0x21b76c4           ATIRadeonX3000GLDriver 2.0ms    0.0   0.0  gldUpdateDispatch  ATIRadeonX3000GLDriver 2.0ms    0.0   0.0    gleDoDrawDispatchCore        GLEngine 2.0ms    0.0   0.0     glDrawElementsACCExec GLEngine 2.0ms    0.0   0.0      glDrawElements     libGL.dylib 2.0ms    0.0   0.0       [Mesh draw]      me  Using array of structures 40 fps Running Time    Self        Symbol Name 393.0ms    7.4 393.0   0x86f6695                393.0ms    7.4 0.0  gleDrawArraysOrElementsExecCore   GLEngine 393.0ms    7.4 0.0    glDrawElementsIMMExec      GLEngine 393.0ms    7.4 0.0     glDrawElements          libGL.dylib 393.0ms    7.4 0.0     [Mesh draw]            me codepre  pIt looks like libGL is making a decision to go in different directions, and the array of structures looks like the X3000 driver isnt getting called.

I may be interpreting Instruments incorrectly.  The modelObj code does call glDrawElementsIMMExec, it also in a roundabout way calls gleDoDrawDispatchCore.  Im not sure if it is just accumulating a bunch of calls at glDrawElementsIMMExec and then blasting them out via gleDoDrawDispatchCore.  Dunno. 2 I think Instruments has issues since it shows the GLEngine calling one of my unused internal 3ds object methods which has no external hooks.  I double checked by setting an Xcode breakpoint there and it never tripped.  I dont do 3DS any more.p  pI guess Ill keep looking around and perhaps stumble on an answer.  If someone would give me an opinion on whether an array of structures is the way to go, it would be appreciated.p  pSOLUTION I added a VBO to the front end of this and all is well.

However, when I attempt to do anything with Internet Explorer 8 and presumably before, I receive a File Download  Security Warning dialog box. I believe this dialog box pops up because the browser doesnt know how to handle the contenttype produced by a JsonResult applicationjson, and so prompts the user to save the return value instead. However, changing the content type in the JsonResult method to, say, textplain or texthtml, doesnt work either. Instead,  IE8 redirects the browser window to display the raw JSON sent back. Neither of these behaviors works for me.p  pI have the sense that the problem stems from the top, which is to say that the ajaxification of an Ajax.BeginForm form simply doesnt happen in IE8, but I could be wrong, and in any case, I dont know what to do about it. p  pAny cluesp  pThanks.p

Also if I was transfering 1GB files I might be pushing my luck depending on Dropboxs speed and my local bandwith utilization.p  pMaybe I should start monitoring the .dropbox.cache folder Any ideasp

Negative 2293 pI wanted to get my concepts a bit clearer regarding the codemalloccode call in C. I have a multithreaded application in which the main thread spawns an arbitrary number of worker threads pthreads. Each worker thread then runs an infinite function the function included is from another code.ccode file and implements a while 1 where by it is responsible for continuous network IO.p  pFor each thread I needed a hash table so I used hash map provided by the glib. What I did was is that I initialized a hash map inside each threads function which on the back end allocates some initial memory for the structure and it can then grow as the need arises.p  pNow when I ran the application it threw errors including segmentation faults and inability to allocate any memory for the structures. It took me a while to find out that the errors were due to the inability to allocate memory for the hash maps. What I thought was still think that each thread will have its own memory space and it will allocate a block of memory for its respective hash map inside its own memory block. I was able to fix the error by using codemutexcode locks before and after the initialization of the hash maps like sudo codep  precodelock mutex initialize hashmap unlock mutex codepre  pThe code for initializing a hash map that is called in each thread is p  precode GHashTable ghashtable   ghashtable  ghashtablenew ginthash, gintequal codepre  pAlthough it solved the problem but I got a little confused after this. Why does this problem occur without he use of locking as each thread has its own memory space for the function it implements and it shouldnt be conflicting with other threads while allocating memory of its own. All guidance much appreciated.p  pthanks.p

Negative 2293 pstrongAbout projectstrong Im trying to write CMSlike website on Java. Previously I used PHP for such purposes, but now I need tight integration with existing serverside solution, written on java, so decided to use Java for website too. Currently, for easier developing, I made some hierarchy of my project toplevel Server class in closest future itll be filled with content and functionality, but now its empty, next Subsystems, Extensions, and as a part of any of this  Modules and Blocks. Each of them have some restrictions and possibilities, not available to one another... Maybe there is other way, but currently I dont know it.p  pIm making some kind of caching, depending on the fact, that mine Dynamic Web Projects vars can be kept in the memory all the time. For example, Tree, that represents all this elements, loaded from database and kept in memory, and all next requests for example, what Extension has this Module as a child  for managing privileges made without asking database.p  pOf course, for this purposes, I need to have some flag, that will tell elements, that their data was changed and they need to refresh it from database. Single global flag in context, for example is bad, while in almost all situations Ill need to refresh single element or group. Single elements flag is done, but...p  pstrongAbout realizationstrong The problem itself. Lets say I have class Modulep  precodepublic abstract class Module     private final static boolean Changed     public static boolean getChanged         return Changed     public static void setChangedboolean newState         Changed  newState     public abstract String getName     public abstract String getTitleHttpServletRequest request,         HttpServletResponse response, ServletContext context codepre  pAnd I have some modulep  precodepublic final class Articles extends Module     public class Article...     private TreeltArticlegt ArticleList     public final ArrayListltArticlegt getArticlesInGroupint groupID         ifgetChanged             refreshFromDatabase         ...       codepre  pHere, for example, this flag used as in case of changing some global preferences, that may change Articles work  for example, some operations on database, that performed through Query browser or some else  class caching a tree of articles and groups it doesnt keeping whole article  only Title, ID, ParentGroup or maybe some else...p  pstrongThe problem itselfstrong in servlet Main in doGet...

Negative 2293 pI have 2 questions. I am developing a ASP.NET web application that uses the standard ASP.NET membership. We intend to have the membership tables in 1 database. We have 2 other databases that stores data for 2 different applications.p  precodeShared  Membership info DB1  Application1 DB2  Application2 codepre  pBoth applications uses the membership info in the Shared database. The Shared database has a table called userdetals that will store additional users info such as name, phone and job title for example.p  pHowever, DB1 also has a table called employees that store the same fields as name, phone and job title. Each employee may be an user.p  pAlso for each table in DB1 and DB2, we keep audit trial, i.e. which user updated the tables in the database. Hence, we need to store UserID in the tables of DB1 and DB2. We thought of having a Users table added in DB1 and DB2. So everytime a new user is created in Shared, the same user will be created in Users table in DB1 and DB2.p  pOur questions arep  ol lipWhat is the best way to maintain database integrity given the above setup E.g. Each employee is assigned as an user. If any fields in DB1 such as username, name and phone is updated, then the same fields in Shared DB should be updated and vice versa.pli lipIs it advisable to have membership database in a different database in our case What is the best solution since almost all the tables in DB1 and DB2 references userID in the Shared database.pli ol

Negative 2293 pIve combed the questions on here hoping to find a similar situation that I am in, but couldnt find one. My question deals with the NSJSONSerialization class in iOS 5, and how to handle parsing a single value returned from the JSONObjectWithDataoptionserror method. The JSON data returned is a single value in an array that looks like thisp  pcode[1]codep  pThe data will either be 1 as seen above or 0, depending on the logic being done in the web service Im using. As a side note, the web service is a WCF REST service. In XCode, the debugger displays the following after the deserialized JSON is assigned to a temporary NSArray objectp  pcodepo parsedDatacodep  pcodeNSArray  43  0x06e2ee70 ltNSCFArray 0x6e2ee70gt 1 codep  pWhen I try to get the value from the array using ObjectAtIndex, I get thisp  pcodepo [parsedData objectAtIndex0]codep  pcodeid 44  0x06b1dad0 1codep  pMy question is what is the hex value code0x06b1dad0code before the code1code Maybe a key or index that I am not accessing I was thinking that I just didnt go far enough into the array to get the real value Does it have something to do with how the JSON is formatted As Ive been thinking about it, I have a feeling that the formatting is off.p  pThe problem I am having is that I cannot get the actual value that is stored in the JSON messagewhen I access the element in the array codeparsedDatacode and assign it to a variable, it is returning just the hex value and not code1code.p  pCasting to NSInteger gives thisp  pcodepo NSInteger[parsedData objectAtIndex0]codep  pcodeNSInteger 45  112319184 1codep  pAny insight into this would be greatly appreciated. I apologize if this has been addressed elsewhere in the forum.p  pThanks.p
Negative 2293 pI am planning to develop a medium to large size web application using JSF plus PrimeFaces or other for the view layer and EJB3 for business logic. The reason weve chosen EJB3 over more lightweight JSF beans that might only require a Servlet container as opposed to an EJB3 container is for additional EJB3 features like security. Since we are targeting deployment on JBoss AS I was wondering what IDE solution you would recommend. Ive seen that both Eclipse and Netbeans support JBoss either outofthebox or with plugins.p
Negative 2293 pI am interested in automating the following process for a systematic literature review which I am conducting.p  pI have a substantial list of disease causing agents and I want to run a batch search on the medical literature and return how many results I get from each type of bug, then put these in a nice CSV file so I can read them into R and crunch some statsfrequency distributions etc.p  pI could do this all with an excel sheet and CTRL C  CTRL V but it would take some time.p  pBasically I need some way to talk to a hrefhttpovidsp.uk.ovid.com relnofollowOvidSPa which hosts the databases I want to search, then feed in a string formatted correctly for the exact search I want to do. Then have OvidSP run the search for me, and return how many hits it gets. I guess this would be easy if they had an API available  I have emailed them directly about this.p  pI wondered if anyone thought this was at all possible or what would be the best way to program a script for this task. I have some experience with Java, C and starting to learn R  I wondered also if Python could be of usep  pThis is a quick illustration of what I hope to achievep  pbugs i want to search for fed into program via CSV file lets saybr  Salmonellabr  E. colibr  Influenzabrp  pinsert fancy program here which connects to Ovid with my credentials and runs the following searchesp  p1  Salmonella AND fever AND hospital    returns 9342 resultsbr 2  E. coli AND fever AND hospital       returns 93821 resultsbr 3  Influenza AND fever AND hospital     returns 323 resultsbrp  pprogram writes this data in a nicely formatted CSV file that I can use for some statsp  pI hope that makes sense Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2293 pI have many git repos with my project parts, which are not related with each other x1, x2, etc. I would like to have a summary repo X, which would include x1, x2, etc. Developers would be able to get all part repos content by cloning this single repo and update to the newest version by pulling it. p  pIf I would be able to push through this repo, it would be just wonderful, but I dont deserve that much. p  pAny ideas how to achieve this I tried submodules on the remote repo, but they dont work, because we use ssh to authenticate and every developer has it own account on the server. Therefore, I guess there is no possibility to hardcode the path to submodules on the remote we dont want to enter login for every submodule during cloning.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pRegards, Bobp

Negative 2293 pI have to display a bunch of images in a page. Images are of different size, some very wide and some very thin. I want to put them all in a container of fixed width and fixed height.p  pThe logic of placing the images should be like this Say if image is smaller than the container, scale it up to the maximum size such that the aspect ratio is maintained, and put it at the center of container.  If image is bigger, scale it down while maintaining  the aspect ratio.p  pSome examples Say our container is 150x150, and we have an image sized 100x50. In this case the image should be scaled up to 150x75. If we have an image sized 100x300, the image should be scaled down to 50x150.p  pWhile this can be easily done with javascript, Id like to avoid that if possible. Im wondering if theres any way to accomplish this with CSS alone. I can live with a CSS3 only solution, or even with webkitfirefox specific directives, as long as it works on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari I will use a fallback for IE if theres no choice.p  pstrongEditstrong I know about maxheight and maxwidth of course. The issue is that if I set both maxheight and maxwidth to 150, images wont be scaled up if needed.p
Negative 2293 pI have a timer application that I am working on that uses two separate XML files to store data.  XML File 1 stores summary data for the time allotted and the name of the game.

Negative 2293 pI am working on a medium size WPF application that utilizes the MVVM pattern. ViewModels use INotifyPropertyChanged to refresh their respective Views.p  pThis approach works perfectly, except for one problem when this application is left running for long periods of time 37 days the Views every single View in the entire app suddenly stop updating their bound properties. p  pIf I set a breakpoint in the ViewModels, they are chugging away happily, calling PropertyChanged like nothing is wrong. However, if I set a breakpoint in the getter of one of the ViewModel objects that the View is bound to, the getter is never calledp  pI am stumped at this point, and dont even know how to debug this issue properly. I have checked the Visual Studio output window for data binding errors, but everything looks normal. It is almost as if the WPF data binding engine has crashed in the background. This app is also monitoring unhandled exceptions AppDomain.UnhandledException and Dispatcher.UnhandledException, but no exceptions are being thrown.p  pstrongSummary After long periods of time, the Views stop updating their data bindings, but the ViewModels are still calling the PropertyChanged event.strongp  pAny advicep

This currently presents a problem because grep appears to evaluate each regex in the file against every line from STDIN which will cause duplicates. The simple solution would be to simply pipe it through codesort  uniqcode and call it a day but that will screw with the formatting of the csv currently in use.

Negative 2293 pOk  first of all I know this isnt ideal  however we have inherited a problem and some badly thought out SSI html.p  pSo some background We have implemented a responsive site which has to include some SSI code from the client for global top nav and footer  so far so good. However the SSI needs to change from DESKTOP to MOBILE as the site is resizedloaded on a mobile device. We do all this client side at the moment. We have a trigger at break points to alter the dom to do all the responsive stuff.p  pA similar example is here a hrefhttpwww.conrandesigngroup.com relnofollowhttpwww.conrandesigngroup.coma. Resize the browser to see what happens.p  pNormally we would load the SSI into holding pages and AJAX the code in to the appropriate place using some kind of selector.p  pThe problem The SSI is not fully formed HTML, it looks something like thisp  precodelt desktop ssi gt ltheadgt ltbodygt Whole bunch of desktop html... ltdiv classcontentgt codepre  pThen the SSI we have for the mobile site isp  precodelt mobile ssi gt ltscriptgtsome script...ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt Whole bunch of mobile html... ltdiv classcontentgt codepre  pSo you will notice there is a closingcodeltheadgtcode and an opening codeltbodygtcode and at the end there is an opening codeltdivgtcode. So there is no way we can select this and replace using the DOM. We were thinking of using comments either side of the code and using a javascript regex to replace the code. Im not sure if this would actually update the browser.p  pSo in desktop mode the whole page will look like thisp  precodelthtmlgt lttitlegtmy pagelttitlegt ltheadgt ...all the head stuff lt START of ssi gt lt desktop ssi gt ltheadgt ltbodygt Whole bunch of desktop html... ltdiv classcontentgt lt END of SSI gt ...all the page HTML ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo thats fine  the HTML is all put together serverside and we can open and close the tags correctly. The problem is how would we change the HTML INSIDE the comments using client side code codelt START of ssi gt...lt END of SSI gtcodep  pIn the end its not really a SSI question  rather a way to change a bit of HTML which is not wrapped up nicely in an element.p  pAnyone come across this issue before or have any suggestionsp

Negative 2293 pIm building a REST API for performing CRUD operations on a database. My tentative stack is Jersey, Spring, Spring Data, JPA and Hibernate. Im also using jerseyspring to supply instances of the resource class so Spring can autowire them.p  pThe API will support CRUD operations on dozens of tables, with concomitant JPA Entities and DAOs backed by Spring Data repositories. The family of DAO interfaces and related DTOs looks something like thisp  precodepublic interface CrudServiceltT extends PersistedObjectgt   ...    public interface PersonService extends CrudServiceltPersongt   ...     public class PersistedObject   ...   public class Person extends PersistedObject   ...   codepre  pHeres a simplified version of a JAXRS resource classp  precodeComponent Pathpeople public class PersonResource       Autowired     private PersonService personService      Pathid     GET     ProducesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON     public Person getPathParamid String id          return personService.findOneLong.valueOfid           POST     ConsumesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON     public Response postPerson person          personService.saveperson         return Response.created.build       codepre  pThe problem is that remainder of the dozens of resource classes look almost identical, the only difference being they operate on a different PersistedObject subclass and its corresponding DAO. Id like to stay DRY by having one resource class that can support the CRUD operations on all entity types, presumably via polymoprhism and clever injection of the DAO. It might look something like thisp  precodeComponent PathresourceType public class CrudResource       Autowired     private CrudService crudService      Pathid     GET     ProducesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON     public PersistedObject getPathParamid String id          return crudService.findOneLong.valueOfid           POST     ConsumesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON     public Response postPersistedObject entity          crudService.saveentity         return Response.created.build       codepre  pThe issues I need to solvep  ul liIf resource methods accept and return PersistedObject, how will JerseyJackson know how to serializedeserialize The coderesourceTypecode variable in the path parameter indicates the concrete type the user is requesting, but I dont know how to wield this to any advantage.li liWhen Spring supplies the resource class instance, how will it know which DAO to injectli ul  pOverall, Im not sure that Im on the right path.

Negative 2293 pEDIT I think I can simplify this question a bit to ask for only what is needed to knowp  pI am working with C using the SSRS 2010 Web Service ReportService2010.asmx a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryee640743.aspx relnofollowhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryee640743.aspxap  pI can use the method CreateDataSource to create a Datasource on an instance of an SSRS Server http servernameReportServer.  p  pI can also use the method CreateCatalogItem to create a report on a server from referencing a projects RDL local file to serialize it to a byte array and then pass that as a Definition to the method to create it on the server.p  pNow everything I do works with a caveat, and a major one.  I can only deploy everything to the same folder.  If I deploy a Data Source to say the Data Sources folder and then a report to say Test Reports, the report does not know it has a shared data source to reference at a different location.   So I dug a little at the technet articles and have tried to GetItemDataSources method but it only gives a name and a type for the ReportingService2010.DataSource return type.  strongDoes anyone know the method to link up a Report or Datasets CatalogItem property of DataSource, so it points to a reference in a different folder on the SSRS Server when deployingstrong  There has to be a way to do it as I know I can deploy from Business Intelligence Development Studio and it can do this.p

Negative 2293 pI want to print a very simple layout with codePrintDocumentcode that fits on one page, so it doesnt require a codeDocumentPaginatorcode. However I want to use codePrinterDialogcode to select the printer. I saw examples with codePrinterSettingscode being a property of codePrinterDialogcode and it was simply assigned to the codePrintDocumentcode. But this doesnt seem to be possible anymore. I also looked for other solutions like custom paginator classes to use but came up empty. I might not have this deep insight into WPF, but why must it always be dongled that way...p

After commenting out the IF statement the relative method works find. Im glad that its working now but can anyone tell what the issue is with the IF p  pEDIT 3 It turns out that my method for checking if something has been selected in the list box doesnt work at all. Instead I shall be iterating through each item in the list and checking if that one is selected. Its a pretty crude method but itll do until I can find a better one.p

Negative 2293 pSo, we have a project that uses jaxb to marshal and unmarshal.  We ont have XSDs. We only have annotated Java objects.  So, when the xml comes into our system, we unmarshal it.  The JAXB docs talk about validating the java objects during the unmarshalling phase.  I would like to be able to add some validation rules somewhere  annotations on the java source, next to the jaxb annotations, perhpas  that would give me a readable, maintainable, declarative style validation mechanism.  But Im not sure that JAXB supports this perhaps the JAXB validation is only driven by XSDs.

However, the underlying data emcouldem be nested arbitrarily deep, which would require arbitrary routing. br I think the ideal for this would be a route that says all the rest of the path goes to any array of parameters, but it doesnt look like there is a way to do anything like that in AngularJS. Just for the sake of completeness, does anyone know of a way to do thisp

Negative 2293 pIm trying to make a simple web server app for the Android which takes the query string from the URL, transmits to a serial device via a USBserial cable, and returns the received response as textplain.  The web server is implemented as a class which extends Thread and it and the USBserial code been working fine for a while. I think a separate thread is required for the TCPIP network operations.p  pI want the server to start when the USBserial cable is attached and stop when the cable is unplugged. By doing this, I can make use of the Launch this app every time the device is connected so I dont have ask the user for USB permission every time.  Theres no UI, so initially I thought I could make a serviceonly app, but I found that Android assumes that it is launching an app with a Main Activity.  I do have it starting OK when the cable is connected. I think I can ultimately make an empty main activity with a translucent screen and just call finish after starting the service.  And Ive got a broadcast receiver which seems to be catching the USB disconnected event OK.p  pWhat Im struggling with is that Android often says unfortunately your app has stopped working and wants to close it kiil the process.  It does seem to hang up the UI, not sure how, since Ive called finish.  The web server thread continues to work fine even while the your app has stopped working message is up, and it continues wo work fine until I answer yes which kills the process.p  pIs there anything special I have to do in the service, since my desire is to keep the service running after empty main activity finishes  Am I on the right track  Does the service need to run in its own processp  pThanks in advance for any insights you can give me.p

I figured out socket programming by my own google search etc., so I dont completely understand every single part. The basic idea is to read a random IP you want to chat with as a String, converting it into an IP and starting two threads, one for sending messages from port A and one for receiving messages at port B the threads are used for being both able to send and recieve messages at the same time. Every thread has its own class. So far, so good. Now both classes have the method run which are both in a big trycatch block. At the two catch blocks, I added several error messages, first Test123 and then Test456 so I can understand what happens when. When compiling the code, I can type in the IP I tried localhost for testing. But when I type in the message, I should recieve the message chat partner sent , but instead I dont get anything. Now both threads are in an infinite loop, so when I force the program to terminate by pressing CtrlC I run the .class via command, I get the error message Test123 before the program terminates. My questions are Why dont I receive any message and why does the program throw Test123 when I force the program to terminate Where are my errors Thanks in advance for helping.

Negative 2293 pThere isnt much to say, so Ill keep it short. I have been using the MonoDevelop IDE along with the a hrefhttpwww.monoproject.comCSharpCompiler relnofollowdmcsa aka a hrefhttpwww.monoproject.comCSharpCompiler relnofollowmcsa for as long as I have been using Linux. However, this is the first time I consider constructing a C program that uses input passed as an argument from command line, and so I thought I would compile my code directly from codeBashcode. The compiler seems to generate a codedebug releasecode by default, and takes a codedebugcode option in case user wants to specify, but a codereleasecode option does NOT exist. I can just select the codeReleasex86code from the dropdown menu in the IDE, but my code will be compiledrun on other computers I have that dont have the IDE installed, so the only way to go about doing what I am trying to accomplish is to tell the compiler to produce a codereleasecode version directly from Bash. Any help would be highly appreciated.p

Negative 2293 pi have a question about the adb forwarder stuffp  pMy situationp  ul liRessources 1 Windows PC where i write my code, 1 Android device Android 2.2 connected via USB to the Windows PC, 1 Linux Server running inside a virtual Machine VMWare on the Windows PCli liTask the android device has to connect the virtual Machine via TCP Port 65001li lirestrictions I am not allowed to use wlan for that because of some issues that i cant influence. I am not able to do usb reverse tethering because my devices does not have the usb tethering option in the android menu disabled by the manufacturer.li ul  pI am able to telnet the port to the virtual machine codetelnet 192.168.1.2 65001code and get my data. So there are no network problems between local and virtual machine. The local ip address is 192.168.1.1.p  pNow i need a bridge from the incoming port 65000 to the listening Port on the virtual machine 65001. I have used the following command codeadb forward tcp65000 tcp65000code to get a tcp connection over usb from my android device to my localhost and vice versa. As I know you cant forward with adb to a remote machine.p  pstrongNow the problem is that i cant bridge from 127.0.0.165000 to any other port to get the full communication path. If I try to create a listening connection on 127.0.0.16500 i get an error with the message that the port is already bindstrong because of codeadb forward tcp65000 tcp65000code. If the forward blocks all other connection on this port, how can i get the incoming data from the android devicep  pIve tried to tunnel via putty localhost65000 win  server65001 and Ive written a little program that creates a listening server socket on 127.0.0.165000 and sends the information to 192.168.1.265001 via 192.168.1.165001.p  pHas anybody an idea how to solve my situation If so please explain. Maybe this helps others too to handle the adb forwarding function.p  phint The Ports and addresses are only examples. The only fix port number is the listening port on the virtual machinep

Negative 2293 pI am reading about timers in Java SDK 1.3p  pIt is mentioned as follows in POSA volume 2 in active object patternp  blockquote   pJDK 1.3 introduced a mechansim for executing timerbased tasks   concurrently in the classes java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask.   When ever the scheduled execution time of a task occurs it is   executed. The scheduling calls are executed in the clinets thread,   while the tasks themselves are executed in a thread owned by Timer   object. A timer internal task queue is protected by locks because the   two threads outlined above operate on it concurrently.p      pThe task queue is implemented as a priority queue so that the next   TimerTask to expire can be identified efficiently. The timer thread   simply waits until this expiration.p blockquote  precodepublic class Reminder      Timer timer      public Reminderint seconds          timer  new Timer         timer.schedulenew RemindTask, seconds1000           class RemindTask extends TimerTask          public void run              System.out.formatTimes upn             timer.cancel Terminate the timer thread                    public static void mainString args[]          new Reminder5         System.out.formatTask scheduled.n       codepre  pMy question is p  ol lipCan we have multiple schedule functions with single timer Request to give an example here and how it works.

Negative 2293 pIn a project of mine I experienced a quite unexpected behaviour when writing a file to a local file system in MS Windows using Java. The filename was generated by the application and contains an invalid char . The program did not guard against that it is now, but I expected an IOException on writing content to that file. The situation is however far more wierd.p  pHere is an SSCE of what I am experiencingp  precodeimport java.io.File import java.io.FileInputStream import java.io.FileOutputStream import java.io.IOException import java.util.Arrays  public class FileWriter     public static void mainString[] args throws IOException      File home  new FileSystem.getPropertyuser.dir     final String fileName  invalidfile.txt       Some cleanup if you rerun the example     File otherFile  new Filehome, invalidf     if otherFile.exists        assertTrueotherFile.delete          File file  new Filehome, fileName     if file.exists        assertTruefile.delete            The real scenario. Writing some content to an illegal file name     FileOutputStream out  new FileOutputStreamfile     final String content  some test content     out.writecontent.getBytes     out.close       Since the write operation does not throw an exception, it is expected some file has been written     assertTruefile.isFile     assertTruefile.canRead       This should usually throw an exception since the file was deleted in the cleanup section.     assertTrueotherFile.exists       Now we try to read the data and make sure it really got stored.     FileInputStream in  new FileInputStreamfile     assert in.available gt 0     byte[] fileContent  new byte[in.available]     assertTruein.readfileContent  content.getBytes.length     assertTrueArrays.equalsfileContent, content.getBytes       private static void assertTrueboolean flag      if flag        throw new RuntimeExceptionAssertion failed          codepre  pSo what is the issue then Windows lists a new file codeinvalidfcode instead of codeinvalidfile.txtcode as expected. The file size is shown as 0 bytes and reading that file with editor and with Java code returns no content. The originally written file does not seem to exist.p  pReading the file codeinvalidfile.txtcode with Java however shows the originally written content as shown in the code above.p  pSo what is the issue here Seems as if there are two files available. One visible, but seemingly empty file and one hidden file with the real content. If I however delete the empty file, the hidden file can also not be accessed anymore. So the filesystem seems to treat both files as the same.p  pMaybe this is related to the Windows and Java version I am using tested with Java 6 and Windows 7.p

Negative 2293 pHave an angular.js directive that renders as a table.  Most of the time, the table is small, so performance is not an issue.  p  pBut sometimes, the table has many rows e.g. thousands, so rendering every row is expensive, as each bound value appears to be evaluated twice, and there are a lot of bound values.  And Angular seems to evaluate this table a lot, only to find that all of the values in it are unchanged and thus need not be rerendered, paralyzing the application needlessly.p  pFor instance, the entire table appears to be rerevaluated when the value of codescope.showMenucode changes on codemouseentercode  codemouseleavecode.p  pIs there a way to tell Angular that the entire table is dependent on some other value, say, codescope.checksumcode thus if that doesnt change, then the entire table doesnt changep  precodeltdiv classheader ngmouseentershowMenutrue ngmouseleaveshowMenufalsegt    lt show dropdown menu only when hovering over the header gt          ltspan ngifshowMenu classmenu dropdown gt  ... menu content goes here...ltspangt     lth2gtgetTitlelth2gt     ltpgtdescriptionltpgt ltdivgt  lttablegt    lttr ngrepeatkey in rowKeysgt         lttd titlegetRowItemkeyprettygtgetRowItemkeyabbreviatedlttdgt       lttdgtgetRowValuekeynumberlttdgt   lttrgt enter code here    lttrgt lttablegt codepre

Negative 2293 pI am reading through Making games with Python amp Pygame and I have noticed that because the author uses lots of functions with drawing in to break his code up, he uses lots of globals  such as codeGRIDSIZEcode or codeBACKGROUNDCOLORcode. I was always told that globals were generally bad, but without them, every drawing function would have ten more, repeating parameters  and I have also been told that repetition is bad. I wondered, then, is the author is correct in using globals for parameters that appear in most drawing functions, or should have just used more, repetitive parameters.p
Negative 2293 pI came across this problem where I should allow different sets of validation when saving a model. Usually the validation depends on how the user wants to save the data. For example, if the user wants to save his data as Draft, I should allow some fields to be  blank.

Negative 2293 pIve been debugging a heap corruption in a software. I can write data to the heap and get control over some pointers. I can achieve my goal of executing code without knowing this but it confused me a bit.p  pThe problem is that I cant find in which heap the block that Im writing to is , nor the heap segments.p  pI used  codeheap x [address] and heap x v [address]code under Windbg and they didnt give me any result. I know that some heaps may reserve another heap segment when no uncommitted space is available in the first one . However, Ive dumped all heap segments and I couldnt find anyone with a base address similar to the one Im looking for.p  pIt seems a little bit weird to me that theres no process or application specific heap having these blocks p

Negative 2293 pIs it possible to strongdefine type and value of variable in parameter of methodstrong existing types string, int, double or your own typesp  pReason for that is to define variable only at parameter not out of function, like other variable.p  pExample just for testp  precodepublic string teststring x return x   testnew StringBuilderNew created string[0].ToString codepre  pabove will just return first char, we want to return hole string or any other type.p  pIf we try to use test method we will use it like thisp  precode    1. example string x  some string testx  or   2. example testsome string  could we make something to write variable inside parameter of method, something like  3. example not valid testnew stringsome string  codepre  ppoint is that you put variable without previously define it like in 1 or 2 examplep

Negative 2293 pIm writing a program C, MinGW 32 bit to batch process images using OpenCV functions, using AngelScript as a scripting language. As of right now, my software has some memory leaks that add up pretty quickly the images are 100200 MB each, and Im processing thousands at once but Im running into an image where Windows doesnt seem to be releasing the memory used by my program until rebooting.p  pIf I run it on a large set of images, it runs for a while and eventually OpenCV throws an exception saying that its out of memory. At that point, I close the program, and Task Managers physical memory meter drops back down to where it was before I started. But heres the catch  every time I try to run the program again, it will fail right off the bat to allocate memory to OpenCV, until I reboot the computer, at which point it will work just great for a few hundred images again.p  pIs there some way Windows could be holding on to that memory Or is there another reason why Windows would fail to allocate memory to my program until a reboot occurs This doesnt make sense to me.p  pstrongEDITstrong The computer Im running this program on is Windows 7 64 bit with 32 GB of ram, so even with my programs memory issues, its only using a small amount of the available memory.

Negative 2293 pIt seems that we can not get sensor data in the web workers. I wonder the reason behind it. The use case is that I am thinking about getting geolocation data in the worker thread and only send the processed version to the main thread.p  pFor GPS, this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11533838html5navigatorgeolocationinwebworkersposta says it is not supported in the worker thread no reason is given. And I double checked it, navigator.geolocation is not supported in web workers. For accelerator and gyroscope, we have DeviceOrientationEvent and DeviceMotionEvent. But we need to use them through the window object, which is not available to the worker thread. The same situation applies to ambient light event.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liWhy navigator.geolocation is not supported in web workers I dont see any reason to prevent it in the worker thread. I think there should be no thread safety or security problems.li liDoes navigator.geolocation belong to navigator This looks like a silly question. But I cannot find a good explanation online quickly... Web workers have access to the navigator object. And I am confused why navigation.geolocation is not supported.li liWhy dont we have raw sensor readings from accelerator and gyroscope I understand that the abstracted event is useful. But there are cases we want to use the raw data for processing. I find that PhoneGap provides ways to access raw sensor data, e.g., through a hrefhttpdocs.phonegap.comen1.2.0phonegapaccelerometeraccelerometer.md.html relnofollownavigator.accelerometera. But my understanding is that such API does not belong to the standardized HTML specification.li liWhat are the related design decisions to decide whether emgeneralem sensor reading should be supported in the worker thread or not General sensor reading support in HTML is currently shelved according to a hrefhttpwww.w3.org2009dap relnofollowW3C Device APIs Working Groupa. Seeing current sensor support gps, accelerator, gyro,  I think we will get abstracted DOM events. And it is likely to have raw sensor data readings through the navigator object. li ol

Negative 2293 pIm not sure if my wording is technically correct, so please correct me in both title and the main body of this question.p  pSo basically my question is regarding emulating polymorphism in C.

And I have some functions to help me insert nodes, delete nodes etc like this as an examplep  precodevoid treeinserttreenode root, treenode newnode codepre  pThen I start to build other stuff for my app, and and need to use this tree to maintain, say, family members.

But they take treenode pointers. Now time for the polymorphism emulation. So here are the two options I have, one is to cast my humannode, one is to use the tnode member in the humannodep  precodehumannode myfamilytreeroot, newfamilyguy some initialization code and other code later... treeinserttreenode ampmyfamilytreeroot, ampnewfamilyguygttnode codepre  pFor concise I put both ways in one function call above.p  pAnd this is exactly where I have my confusion.

I cant think of any way to represent this problem as a graph problem.p  pIf X is the largest number by absolute value in the array, the upper and lower bounds of maxsum are N and N2, respectively.p  pEDIT examples. p  p4, 6, 10 reorder the list as the following 6, 10, 4, so that the sumpeak is 6.p  p1, 1, 1, 1, 4 reorder the list as the following  1, 1, 4, 1, 1 , so that the sumpeak is 2.p

Negative 2293 pI know that we can use PIVOTUNPIVOT in SELECT statement to get the transpose of result set. p  pHowever, this time I am facing a scenario where I am getting result set from a stored procedure.p  pAlso, the output given by stored procedure is not fixed but changes dynamically. So exact number of ROWS in actual output is not fixed OR in other words, exact number of COLUMNS in transposed result set is not fixed.p  pSo I am not able to think of solution which can give me the transposed result set of stored procedure.p  pCan this be donep

Negative 2293 pFor our game, written in Adobe AIR, we want one of the sounds in the game to be the notification sound when we display a local, or push notification, on Android.p  pCurrently we have a solution were not really happy thats below, because it requires extra Android permissions that we really feel is unnecessary.

Negative 2293 pSo Im working in a TFS Build Definition, in a custom build process that will execute some logic based on configurations the user chooses. Im doing this as part of an effort to automate a test lab more fully and make it more selfservice.p  pSpecifically, I need to give the user the option to restart the SQL Servers Services prior to a test run, thus allowing all caches to be cleared and maintaining a stable start point for all test measurements.p  pIn order to use something that isnt written by hand and is more fully tested than something I could hack together using codeServiceControllercode calls, I want to use codeWMIcode and the codeWMI Build Activitycode from the a hrefhttpstfsbuildextensions.codeplex.com relnofollowTFSBuildExtensionsa project on Codeplex. Using this activity rather than coding my own custom activity also allows me access to some logging and error handling I would otherwise have to code myself. Additionally, using a WMI activity allows me to keep all of the logic at the code.XAMLcode layer, which is consistent with how everything else is done in the build process.p  pThe problem is that the incode documentation for the codeWMIcode activity is a little unclear. For example, Im not seeing where it references the codeMachineNamecode agrument it asks for in codePropertiescode, and as well Im not quite sure how I am supposed to pass in MethodParameters for use on a remote machine. Do I just enter something likep  pcodeCommandLineNet Stop MSSQLServer ycodep  pOr what The error I am seeing for that specific line is p  pcodeString cannot be converted to System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerableOf String because Char is not derived from String as required for the Out generic parameter T in Interface IEnumerableOf Out T.codep  pIve read over some stuff about codeWMIcode but I am probably missing something about making it connect to a Win32 process to start.p
Negative 2293 pI have a webgrid which gets value from database on load of a partial view in MVC 4 razor. It has 6 columns in total. 1st column is a checkbox column, header is Select. Two buttons are there in the page not inside the webgrid, Save and Delete. By selecting any checkbox, if I click on the Delete button it will remove the row from the webgrid but not from the database. After hitting the Save button all the data will be saved to the database by updating the deleted record.p  pOut of other 5 columns, 4 columns are coming from database. The rest column is a priority filter column. for that I have used two pictures. One is UPARROW and another is DOWNARROW pixel 16 X 16. Now the purpose of this two picture is to swap between rows. By clicking UPARROW of a particular row, the entire row values will be swap with the upper row and for just opposite for the DOWNARROW.p  pA condition is there, if the selected row is the topmost one or the last one then for clicking on the UPARROW and clicking for DOWNARROW wont work respectively.p  pI have done every other work except this swapping. I have no idea. But for your information database has a field SEQUENCE. By swapping rows SEQUENCE will be maintained like 1 for 1st row, 2 for 2nd row and so on. Now if swapping takes place then row 2 may take row 1s position, its present sequence will also be changed from 2 to 1. That value will be stored in a hidden text field.p  pPlease help    p  pMove up amp Move down both should work with the first and last row condition. I need to go down also...please help...p

Negative 2293 pI am trying to create a simple socket based serverclient communication between a Javabased socket server and PHPbased socket client. I am getting all the responses as expected but not immediately. Here is what I am trying to do. PHP client sends a command to the Java server, it responds back with an answer. This answer should be displayed on PHP page immediately. Then a second command is sent and again, the server sends a response which should be displayed immediately. However in my case, the responses are echoed only after entire socket based communication is terminated.

Negative 2293 pSince its a bit difficult to explain, I did a mockup to get across as much as possible visuallyp  pa hrefhttpsassmeister.comgist70624a740b1ca4ae7764 relnofollowhttpsassmeister.comgist70624a740b1ca4ae7764ap  pIf theres a better way to share a sass gist, let me know.  First time using itp  pBasically, this is the layout I want for a tablet in landscape mode.  What Im trying to do is make sure it fits perfectly on different tablets with different aspect ratios.  Some things are fixed.  The main content area is a 16x9 video, so that aspect is locked.  p  pI have the header and footer main column only fixed right now as they need to be for portrait mode, but I could bring them into the regular flow if its helpful for tablet landscape.  Anyway, its all basic responsive right now via susy2, and the sidebar is totally separate so it can scroll independent of the main content.  What I would like is for the whole main area including header and footer to fit perfectly with even margins above and below vid, but then have the sidebar column change its width to match the tablet.p  pSo... if the tablet is wider, the teaser thumbnails go out to 16x9 ratio.  If the tablet is narrower, the main column remains unchanged, but the teaser thumbs narrow down to squares.  p  pIf its easier first to just figure out how to responsively shrink the right column only, so the aspect of thumbs is unchanged, thats ok. I just dont want the overall layout to get screwed up on one device vs another because of aspect ratio, so main focus is that the header hits top, footer hits bottom, main vid fits perfectly between them, then sidebar responds to fill in the rest within reason.p  pthx for any input.  First time making a website here, so lots to learn.  p  pps.  I had vertical scroll enabled for the right column, but disabled it by adding extra letter to to the scrolling class in scss column since its not actually letting me scroll.   Not sure if thats because theres no actual content, or it doesnt recognize the empty padded cells as something worthy of scrolling.p

Also, I should be able to have a periods page where I click in Period 1 Weekly of 2014 and get a report from that period.p  pI have a periods table with id, periodno, fromdate, todate, type Weekly, monthly, every 14 days, and another table that its related to periods table by periodid. So I want to know what would be the best way to handle this should I initially set a certain number of periods for instance lets assume 2015 its tomorrow, so tomorrow the system automatically would fill the periods table with all the corresponding periods for this year or should I create periods manually or dont save periodos at all and have them all calculated at the moment I make a request without saving in a DBp  pI hope I made myself clear.p

Negative 2293 pI have a WinForms application, using EF6.1. I have bindingsource and bindingnavigator automatically populated on the forms. Doubleclicking a customer in a GridView leads me to a new form where I show details for this customer as details, with the option of adding new customers. The bindingsource has only one item and the context.Local likewise. Clicking the plussign in the navigator adds another customer, and the bindingsource now have two items to keep track of while context.Local still have only one. I need to make my context aware of this new record, but everything Ive tried seem to add yet another record to the bindingsource. This will give me an exception when trying to save, as nonnullable columns are not populated.

Negative 2293 pI have created a custom tab control for my Windows application. The custom tab control extends System.Windows.Forms.TabControl.

Here is a quick look at the class definitionp  precode[ToolboxItemtrue]     public partial class CustomTabControl  System.Windows.Forms.TabControl codepre  pTo store each individual namefont pair I created a nested class inside CustomTabControlp  precode[TypeConvertertypeofTabFontConverter] public class TabFont      public string Name  get set      public Font Font  get set              public TabFont                       public TabFontstring name, Font font              this.Name  name         this.Font  font       codepre  pNote the use of the emTypeConverterem property above the TabFont class.

The model introduces different orders defined on a set of actions and defines so called wellformed executions. Some people are trying to explain the memory model restrictions using one of such orders, namely happensbefore, but it seems like the order, at least by itself, does not define acceptable execution p  blockquote   pIt should be noted that the presence of a happensbefore relationship between two actions does not necessarily imply that they have to take place in that order in an implementation.

Negative 2293 pLets say I have code like thisp  precodefoo  fooFactory.create codepre  pFor various reasons, codefooFactory.createcode could fail to create an instance of codeFoocode. p  pIf it does, I want codefooFactory.createcode to return a dummynoop object. This object should be completely inert  no matter how it is used, it should not do anything or throw any exceptions. Note that codefoocode does not have methods that return values.p  hr  pIve considered the following options.p  pFirst, create a bmockb. The upside of this is that its easy and gives me exactly what I want. The downside is that it feels odd to use a mock in production code. More importantly, I have no control over the mock library and so its behavior could change at some point and break my application.p  pSecond, create a bdummyb codeNoopFoocode codeDummyFoocode class. I then manually implement the methods it needs to support, and just put codepasscode in the method bodies. The upside of that I know it will never break my application. The downside is that if other methods of codeFoocode are used in future, I have to know to update codeNoopFoocode codeDummyFoocode ... or my application may break. p  pIs there a better option than either of these Note that Im new to Python so if it involves more advanced Python features, I would appreciate a little more information. Thanksp
Negative 2293 pI have a Java EE application running on GlassFish 4  Java  8 x64.  Development is on a Windows machine, but it will eventually be ported to Linux either Red Hat or Ubuntu.  In that application I have the requirement to send email messages from an SMTP server requiring user authentication and Im using codeJavaMailcode to perform the connection and send the email messages.  These emails are sent on behalf of the system during successful user registration, password reset requests, etc. The user initiating the action, therefore, will not have the credentials to send the email.  The same email credentials are used for all such actions, and the email account in question is dedicated for this use.p  pThe approaches which immediately come to mind are to store the sending email account username and plaintext password in a database or some other data store, or to hard code the username and plaintext password in the Java EE application.  This has an obvious security risk typically associated with storing passwords in the clear.p  pThere are variations on this, where I could store an encrypted version of the password in either the database or hard coded in the application.  At that point, Im back to finding a method to storing the key to decrypt password.p  pWhat methods exist to securely managing such credentials in Java EE  Am I stuck with storing this in plain textp

This is problematic because 1 the cost is higher in terms of readwrites 2 the deletion and readding need to be kept independent with the one coming strictly after the other so the new codeSchoolcodes dont get deleted as well. This can probably be achieved with transactionsli liExplicitly deleting all the orphaned codeStudentcode by querying for them before persisting the second codeSchoolcode and checking them against the codeschool.getStudentscode. This approach has a high cost associated with it and adds lots of complexity.li ol  pAnother possibility would be designing the objects in such a way that I could query for all codeStudentcodes that were not orphaned. Then I could delete orphans at fixed intervals just for purposes of keeping storage costs low. However, I dont see how to achieve such a result while still maintaining codeSchoolcodes and codeStudentcodes that replace an old instance when persisted by having the same primary key.p

Because Base is abstract, i cant create Base object, therefore i can call foo only on derived classes, but this means that Basebar will never be called Sure, i could have defined foop  precodevoid Basefoo     bar     Basebar  codepre  pBut for what It would not be better to define a non virtual private function with the body of bar and replace Basebar with it, and make the body of the pure virtual emptyp  pIf so, why should I have bar private and not protected p  pPS I have tried to find a solution on internet, and i know there are posts like  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12234745cprivatevirtualfunctionsvspurevirtualfunctionsC Private virtual functions vs. pure virtual functionsa , but they help in understanding private virtual function, not private PURE virtual function. If Im wrong, forgive mep

Negative 2293 pWe are creating large scale, database oriented business application. This business application is multitenant and we want to provide it as SOA Software as a service in Azure cloud. Azure SQL Database has limit of 150 GB only which is not sufficient for us. Our clients have huge volume of data that is likely to increase every year. Our application database is relational and complex and uses complex queries Groups, Joins, Aggregate functions, stored procedures to fetchsave data. Therefore we are reluctant to use Big Table directly.  There is a suggestion to break database into partitions and file groups, but we are not going for it. There is another possibility to keep only current year data into app and rest into other partitionbackup database, but this does not suit our application as past data is accessed frequently. If we use Azure Table our complex operations will be done in memory, which is not possible because of limited memory resources. We are thinking however to make a mix of Azure SQL Database and Azure Table. But we are unable to find any suitable example that uses a mix of both.p  pWe are looking for answers of following questions as wellp  ol liIs azure suitable to keep very large scale of relational data TBs or should we have our own database servers to support thisli liShould we use only Azure Table and NOT Azure SQLli liShould we use mix of Azure SQL and Azure Table storage Is there any sample architectureexample that guides us about itli ol

At the end of the execution I wanted to bring the memory leaks location to the output using CMemoryState class, so I could finally compare the allocations trace with the CMemoryStates compare difference trace.li ul  pThe problem is, that the application compiles in VS 2010 debug mode, but the following linker errors are occurredp  blockquote   pError 4   error LNK2005 void  cdecl operator new[]unsigned int,char const ,int UYAPAXIPBDHZ already defined in CMemLeakHunter.obj ESoftwareNafxcwd.libafxmem.obj   Error 3   error LNK2005 void  cdecl operator newunsigned int,char const ,int 2YAPAXIPBDHZ already defined in CMemLeakHunter.obj    ESoftwareNafxcwd.libafxmem.obj   Error 5   error LNK2005 public static void  stdcall CObjectoperator newunsigned int,char const ,int 2CObjectSGPAXIPBDHZ already defined in CMemLeakHunter.obj  ESoftwareNafxcwd.libafxmem.obj   Error 6   error LNK1169 one or more multiply defined symbols found ESoftwareModule1.exe   1p blockquote  pI googled and found out, that ignoring the library emNafxcwd.libem may solve the problem. In my application not, I tried out, but ignoring that library, another 17000 linker error unresolved externals.p  pAdditional dependencies are codeNafxcwd.libWs232.libVersion.libcodep  pIgnore specific default libraries are codemsvcprtd.liblibcimtd.liblibcmt.libcodep  pstrongI cant split the software so easily, therefore I ask for help how could I trace the memory allocations done by my own app if I am using MFC and I need to use the .lib files mentioned above What could be the solution Please help me to resolve this matter to be able to trace the memory allocations to find out the possible sources of the leaks. Im also openminded to use another MFC builtin routines if they are able to do this.

Negative 2293 pI need to group a bunch of items in my web app by date created.p  pEach item has an exact timestamp, e.g. code1417628530199code. Im using a hrefhttpmomentjs.com relnofollowMoment.jsa and its a hrefhttpmomentjs.comdocsdisplayingfromnow relnofollowtime from nowa feature to convert these raw timestamps into nice readable dates, e.g. code2 Days Agocode. I then want to use the readable date as a header for a group of items created on the same date.p  pThe problem is that the raw timestamps are too specific  two items that are created on the same date but a minute apart will each have a unique timestamp. So I get a header for code2 Days Agocode with the first item underneath, then another header for code2 Days Agocode with the second item underneath, etc.p  pWhats the best way to round the raw timestamps to the nearest date, so that any items created on the same date will have the exact same timestamp and thus can be grouped togetherp

Negative 2293 pI am using Angular and Hottowel for the first time and I wanted to extend the dataservice to leverage the functionality of restangular to provide REST data into the rest of the hottowel app.p  pI have included restangular and have it making a successful REST get.p  pI realise that the restangular docs discuss using the promise directly within a controller so i am now wondering whether including it in the dataservice is viable.p  pThe problematic function is getJobs. Its the only function that uses restangular. Its defined in dataservice as a function and also added to the dataservice variable to expose it. It has a matching function in the dashboard controller. Its also added to the list of promises in the dashboard controller. I have confirmed the function returns a list of objects within the restangular function. I get nothing in the dashboard controller even though the promise executes the then clause.p  pAny guidance gratefully appreciated.p  pThanksp  pSimonp  pCode belowp  pstrongdataservice.jsstrongp  precodefunction   use strict  angular     .moduleapp.core     .factorydataservice,dataservice  dataservice.inject  [q,Restangular]  ngInject  function dataserviceq,Restangular      var service           getPeople getPeople,         getMessageCount getMessageCountXXX,         getJobs getJobs           return service        function getJobs          var jobs  []         var baseJobs  Restangular.alljobs          baseJobs.getList.thenfunctionjobs              console.logWithin dataservice.getJobs             console.logjobs                   return q.whenjobs         console.logEndofgetJobspost return shouldnt get here                   function getMessageCountXXX  return q.when72       function getPeople          var people  [             firstName John, lastName Papa, age 25, location Florida,             firstName Ward, lastName Bell, age 31, location California,             firstName Colleen, lastName Jones, age 21, location New York,             firstName Madelyn, lastName Green, age 18, location North Dakota,             firstName Ella, lastName Jobs, age 18, location South Dakota,             firstName Landon, lastName Gates, age 11, location South Carolina,             firstName Haley, lastName Guthrie, age 35, location Wyoming         ]         return q.whenpeople           codepre  pstrongdashboard.Controller.jsstrongp  precodefunction   use strict  angular     .moduleapp.dashboard     .controllerDashboardController, DashboardController  DashboardController.inject  [q, dataservice, logger]  ngInject  function DashboardControllerq, dataservice, logger, api      var vm  this     vm.news           title helloWorld,         description Hot Towel Angular is a SPA template for Angular developers.          vm.messageCount  0     vm.people  []     vm.jobs  []     vm.title  Dashboard       activate      function activate          var promises  [getMessageCount, getPeople, getJobs ]         return q.allpromises.thenfunction              logger.infoActivated Dashboard View                    function getMessageCount          return dataservice.getMessageCount.thenfunction data              vm.messageCount  data             return vm.messageCount                    function getPeople          return dataservice.getPeople.thenfunction data              vm.people  data             return vm.people                    function getJobs          console.logWithin getJobs         return dataservice.getJobs.thenfunction data              vm.jobs  data             console.logdata             return vm.jobs         , function reason             console.logreason                    codepre  pRelevant part of dashboard.htmlp  precode ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcolmd6gt                 ltdiv classwidget wvioletgt                     ltdiv htwidgetheader titleJobs                          allowcollapsetruegtltdivgt                     ltdiv classwidgetcontent textcenter textinfogt                         lttable classtable tablecondensed tablestripedgt                             lttheadgt                                 lttrgt                                     ltthgtNameltthgt                                     ltthgtDescriptionltthgt                                     ltthgtStatusltthgt                                     ltthgtCategoryltthgt                                 lttrgt                             lttheadgt                             lttbodygt                                 lttr ngrepeatp in vm.jobsgt                                     lttdgtp.namelttdgt                                     lttdgtp.descriptionlttdgt                                     lttdgtp.statuslttdgt                                     lttdgtp.categorylttdgt                                 lttrgt                             lttbodygt                         lttablegt                     ltdivgt                     ltdiv classwidgetfootgt                         ltdiv classclearfixgtltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt     codepre

All attempts below are after the Eclipse has been shutdown and both computer and device rebooted.p  pHave seen quite a few S.O. entries but none resolve the intermittent issue of the dreaded helpful message unable to connect to 192.168.xx.xxp  pIt will work successfully sometimes, then pop cant connect via wireless Connection.  One suggestion I saw was to disconnect the USB after the adb tcpip 5555 command.  This worked for me for a while.

And to repeat the steps, Still get the helpful message unable to connect to 192.168.0.4p  pI have tried specifying that the Nexus use wireless from the Nexus itself using a terminal app, although I am uncertain if these commands are taking affect as the device is not rooted. setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555 stop adbd start adbdp  pAny help in determining what causes the intermittent nature of this connectivity would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 2293 pI have a little trouble using NetBeans to work on my Vagrant virtual server. What I tried is to create a new PHP Project on a remote server, then NetBeans ask me for the connection so I created a new connection. For hostname I putted in code127.0.0.1code and as user codevagrantcode I linked the private key file generated by vagrant and filled in the initial directory.p  pWhen I try to connect like this it asks me for the password for user vagrant which I dont have, since it should provide the private key file.... With Vagrant I would need to connect to port code2222code instead of code22code for ssh connections anyway, so I changed the hostname to code127.0.0.12222code. Now I get a codejava.net.UnknownHostException 127.0.0.12222codep  pTherefore the question Was anyone of you able to connect to a vagrant machine with SFTP using NetBeans If yes, howp  pNote Not sure if its important, but Im using an Ubuntu 14.04 machine and my NetBeans version is 8.0.2, Ive installed the PHPWeb package.p
Negative 2293 pI am trying to create a webservice, that would be able to receive a file from client, process it for example open the txt file, change the values somehow etc. and then provide it to client after it is processed.p  pThe things I have done so far is that I have a servicehost and WinForm application for client, that is able to choose file, send it and then get the list of files that are stored on served and manualy download selected file back Im using WCF streaming.p  pNext thing I need to do is create some sort of queue  it would be nice to have the file download process from server automated. But there is also possibility, that before the server manage to process the file from client, the client could go intetionaly or not offline and thus the server would not be able to send the file back.p  pI checked some manuals and tutorial and found out, that there is a builtin technology called MSMQ, that could be used in WCF  it simply put the data in queue, if the clientserver is not avaiable atm and attempt to send them later. The only problem is, that in each manual, they are working only with methods they put methods call in queue but not with files. p  pMy question is  is it possible to implement MSMQ with file streaming somehow Or should I choose different approachp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 2293 pApples documentation says When a segue is triggered, it causes a new view controller to be instantiated and transitioned onscreen. Some behavior Im seeing has me questioning if the VC is actually destroyed and recreated each time the view is sequed to.p  pIn my application each time I seque to a particular view I note that the  the following viewController function is called which is consistent with the VC being recreated each time it is sequed top  precode idinitWithCoderNSCoder aDecoder  codepre  pNote, this viewController is also a datasource for its collectionView and has a propertyp  precodeproperty strong, nonatomic NSMutableArray messages codepre  pAnd every time initWithCoder is called I alloc and init a messages array and assign it to the above pointer.p  pWhen I navigate back to another view and then seque back again Im seeing strangeness that has me thinking that the VC might be being reused.  Or alternately if the first instance wasnt destroyed and can still receive notifications.  p  pThe first thing that is strange is that in viewDidLoad if I call addObserverself for a particular notification which I want this VC to handle then the second time I seque into this VC I will get two notifications sent to the VCs notification handler for every notification sent.  This is consistent with the VC being reused otherwise why would the handler get called twice  p  pBut going against this reuse scenario is that initWithCoder is infact being called the second time the View is loaded.  p  pSince I dont want 2 or more notifications generated for every notification post, I use a static boolean to guarantee that addObserver is only called once.  I.e. addObserver is only called the first time viewDidLoad is called, and not subsequent times.p  pviewDidLoad and notification handler access the messages array.  On the second seque, viewDidLoad seems to access a newly allocinitd messages array but when the notification handler accesses messages it seems to be the previous messages array from the previous time the VC was loaded.p  pAny ideasp

Im fine with this, the order in the database doesnt matter, I just want them sorted when Im using them in the application without having to explicitly do it in every single location its ever used in the entire app.p  pThere are two overloads of the Sort method.p  precodevoid Sort void SortltTComparergt codepre  pI need the latter so I can specify that it should compare the specific field I need to accomplish the sorting.

Nothing is sorted. I tried changing my child items mapping to Set, and it blows up with a NotImplementedException Exception. for similar reasons as I had tried above, using a List mapping wont work because the field I want to sort by is not on the child item directly.p  pSo I started to look at the source code for the MappingByCode to see how the Sort methods are implemented. This is a summarized  view of what I found for the respective mapping implementations...p  precodepublic class BagMapper      public void Sort      public void SortltTComparergt    public class SetMapper      public void Sort              mapping.sort  natural           public void SortltTComparergt              throw new NotImplementedException       codepre  pHow exactly is Sort ever used when mapping by codep

Negative 2293 pI have PHP application using mysql as its database. The application is not heavy, normally it loads immediately. It has admin page, where I can run some queries which might return very long lists. There is also cron process backing whole database few times a day. p  pI noticed, that user pages which normally loads very fast can timeout or become slow when backup or long running about 30sec admin query is taking place. p  pServer is single processor virtual machine. I think that even if theres another thread using database, it should still respond 2 or 3 times slower, not like 100 times slower. p  pSo how should I address this problem  Can I set priority to mysql query or can it be more PHPApache problem  I dont have too much information about it, because it happens rarely and mostly just reported by users. p  pI will be happy for any hint where to start looking because I dont want to testdebug production site nor install test environment.

Negative 2293 pASP.NET 4.0 Due to a network delay allowing users to hit the form submit button many times, resulting in duplicate entries, Im trying to use Javascript to disable the button after the first click until postback. I do not know Javascript so I apologize for my cluelessness.  The problem button is in a form within an updatepanel within a tabcontrol on a page with several forms, etc. so Im using a validation group that contains different validators that turn off or on depending on a dropdown selection. p  pHeres my buttonp  precodeltaspButton IDBtnAddProd runatserver OnClickBtnAddProdClick   TextAdd Status ValidationGroupActivityValControls   onclientclickdisableBtnOnClickthis,ActivityValControls   CausesValidationFalse gt codepre  pHeres my Javascriptp  precodefunction disableBtnOnClickbtnName, valGroup      var isGroupValid  PageClientValidatevalGroup  check if validation group is successful if isGroupValid      set button to disabled so you cant click on it.            btnName.disabled  true     btnName.value  Please wait...      else          alertPage is not validfor testing       codepre  pIve gone down many different roads and this is the closest Ive gotten. It works in one case  only if the first click results in a validation error, then I correct the error and submit. If there are no errors, either due to my dropdown selection having no associated validators i.e. when they want to add a free text comment record or if I correctly enter all the validated fields the first time then it very quickly flashes to disabled with the Please wait text then back to enabled and default text. If I then click it many times very quickly, it eventually disables with the Please wait text and stays there.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 2293 pThis is more a general question about the inner workings of the language. I was wondering how javascript gets the value of an index. For example when you write  codearray[index]code does it loop through the array till it finds it or by some other means the reason I ask is because I have written some code where I am looping through arrays to match values and find points on a grid, I am wondering if performance would be increased by creating and array like codearray[gridX][gridY]code or if it will make a difference. what I am doing now is going through a flat array of objects with gridpoints as properties like thisp  precodevar array  [x1,y3] codepre  pthen looping through and using those coordinates within the object properties to identify and use the values contained in the object.p  pmy thought is that by implementing a multidimensional grid it would access them more directly as can specify a gridpoint by saying codearray[1][3]code instead of looping through and doing p  precodefor  var a  0 a lt array.length a  1      if array[a].x  1 ampamp array[a].y  3          return array[a]       codepre  por something of the like.p  pany insight would be appreciated, thanksp

And Im sure that I dont manipulate with their values during program execution the position of vertices stays stable, but the normals do not.p  pHere are two screens for some frames at codet1code and codet2codep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEtmyl.jpg altnormals outputp  pMy vertex structurep  precodestruct MyVertexvertex structure     MyVertex  weightCount0, normal0,0,0         textureCoordinates.x  1         textureCoordinates.y  1          MyVertexfloat x, float y, float z, float u, float v, float nx, float ny, float nz          positionx, y, z, textureCoordinatesu, v, normal0,0,0, weightCount0           DirectXXMFLOAT3 position     DirectXXMFLOAT2 textureCoordinates     DirectXXMFLOAT3 normal  DirectXXMFLOAT31.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f      will not be sent to shader and used only by skinned models     int startWeightIndex     int weightCount 0 means that its not skinned vertex  codepre  pThe corresponding vertex layoutp  precodelayout[0]   POSITION, 0, DXGIFORMATR32G32B32FLOAT, 0, 0, D3D11INPUTPERVERTEXDATA, 0  layout[1]   TEXCOORD, 0, DXGIFORMATR32G32FLOAT, 0, 12, D3D11INPUTPERVERTEXDATA, 0  layout[2]   NORMAL, 0, DXGIFORMATR32G32B32FLOAT, 0, 20, D3D11INPUTPERVERTEXDATA, 0  codepre  pVertex bufferp  precodeD3D11BUFFERDESC bd ZeroMemoryampbd, sizeofbd bd.Usage  D3D11USAGEDEFAULT D3D11USAGEDYNAMIC bd.ByteWidth  sizeofMyVertex  structuregtgetVerticesCount bd.BindFlags  D3D11BINDVERTEXBUFFER bd.CPUAccessFlags  0 D3D11SUBRESOURCEDATA InitData ZeroMemoryampInitData, sizeofInitData InitData.pSysMem  structuregtvertices ifdevicegtCreateBufferampbd, ampInitData, ampbuffersgtvertexBuffer  SOK     return false  codepre  pAnd the shader that output normals as color of course, if I set codeoutput.normalcode to codefloat31,1,1code, objects stays whitep  precodestruct Light      float3 diffuse     float3 position     float3 direction   cbuffer cbPerObject  registerb0      float4x4 WVP     float4x4 World      float4 difColor     bool hasTexture     bool hasNormMap   cbuffer cbPerFrame  registerb1      Light light    Texture2D ObjTexture Texture2D ObjNormMap SamplerState ObjSamplerState TextureCube SkyMap  struct VSINPUT      float4 position  POSITION     float2 tex  TEXCOORD     float3 normal  NORMAL   struct VSOUTPUT      float4 Pos  SVPOSITION     float4 worldPos  POSITION     float3 normal  NORMAL     float2 TexCoord  TEXCOORD     float3 tangent  TANGENT   VSOUTPUT VSVSINPUT input      VSOUTPUT output     input.position.w  1.0f     output.Pos  mulinput.position, WVP     output.worldPos  mulinput.position, World     output.normal  input.normal     output.tangent  mulinput.tangent, World     output.TexCoord  input.tex     return output   float4 PSVSOUTPUT input  SVTARGET      return float4input.normal, 1.0    Techniques  technique10 RENDER      pass P0              SetVertexShader CompileShader vs40, VS              SetPixelShader CompileShader ps40, PS           SetBlendState SrcAlphaBlendingAdd, float4 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f , 0xFFFFFFFF            codepre  pstrongWhere have I made an mistakestrong Maybe there are other places in code that can cause that strange behavior some locking, buffers, dunno...p  hr  peditp  pAs strong413Xstrong suggested, Ive run the DirectX Diagnosticp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSb9jl.jpg altenter image description herep  pWhat is strange that on the small preview, the screen looks the same as in program.

The Person object is also maintained inside the controller so i dont have to maintain the reference to the same object as the object is directly attached to the cart. I can simpply do codescope.person  codebrbr 2. Second Example The ajax state is maintained by the service which now exposes the person object as well as the functions used to manipulate the object. Now i need to maintain the reference to object bby using functions sucn as codeangular.extendcode and codeangular.copycode. Now the ajax state exposed by a controller is divided over multiple services. Advantages are modularity of the code and almost complete logic less controller.p

Negative 2293 pI have a controller that sends lists via coderenderlist1,list2,list3code, and then plots the results using Flot Charts. Id like to plot them as realtime charts, but I know its a bit tricky. These lists are extracted from a database, a database that is not finished as the simulation goes on, new data is added. Therefore, when I render the lists, they do not have all the values, as they only have the values at a particular instant. p  pI wonder what would be the easiest way to obtain this updating data. After putting so much thought, and realising that Play has nothing to do with PHP, Ive had an idea, and I want to know if it is possiblep  pMy idea is using AJAX or something similar in order to refresh the page render again the data every x seconds, and creating a fake impression of realtime plots. By doing that, I hope that the lists get updated and I can plot them as if it were realtime. p  pHow can I do that in my views .html file and controller Is there any other way of doing that without the need to refresh Thanksp

Negative 2293 pIm encountering a bug that has me stumped.  Ive narrowed it down to an issue with the pragma pack command in GCC specifically RHEL Linux, GCC v.4.4.7 that can be recreated in the small sample case Ive shown below.  It looks like GCC is computing the wrong offset in this case, which will manifest itself as a crash within the loop.  Removing the pragma pack also removes the fault  but in the real application this will cause many additional gigabytes of memory use and is not desirable.  p  pIn the example below, you will need to compile with optimizations enabled O3 to experience the failure.  Ive also provided an example item cMagic in the structure that can be removed which will change the structure alignment and keep the bug from triggering. p  pIve taken a look at the generated assembly and believe this may be a compiler bug.

Negative 2293 pI have a case where I need to insert a frame or many frames to the middle of a video.  I looked at doing ffmpeg cutting, inserting, and then concatenation but unfortunately I have a lot of cuts and the stitch back has a lot of choppiness.  My thought was that I could leave the video whole and then insert frames as the exact spots that I need to do that.  This way I would solve the choppiness problem.p  pI am currently using ffmpeg and dont really see any way to accomplish this task with that tool.  Google doesnt seem to be providing much help either.p  pHas anyone done this before  What did you do to insert frames at specific spots.p  pAs an FYI  I am doing my processing in Java, using FFMPEG, and my video files are mp4 although I could convert.p  pThank you in advance.p

Just docs stating that it should be possible but without any details.p  pThanks for any helpp  pstrongUpdatestrong I was able to get much further by using codeld rcode as suggested below, in combination with codeforceloadcodeemmy libraryem and codereexportlibrarycodeemevery module library, plus many of the GHC framework librariesem.  You can see the new code at the same git repo.  The codebuildlib.shcode builds the Haskell library, and codebuildc.shcode then uses that library to build a Csource executable that consumes it.p  pI am still unable to solve Problem 1 or Problem 3, and I am also struggling to find a way to automatically pick up all of the right module library dependencies.  I will update if I get a complete solution.p

Negative 2293 pIm trying to write a regular expression using C.Net that matches 14 alphanumerics followed by spaces, followed by 10 digits.  The catch is the number of spaces plus the number of alphanumerics must equal 4, and the spaces must follow the alphanumerics, not be interspersed.  p  pIm at a total loss as to how to do this.  I can do code[AZazds]1,4[d]10code, but that lets the spaces fall anywhere in the first four characters.  Or I could do code[AZazd]1,4[s]0,3[d]10code to keep the spaces together, but that would allow more than a total of four characters before the 10 digit number.p  pValid codeA12B1234567890 AB1 1234567890 AB  1234567890codep  pInvalid codeAB1  1234567890 more than 4 characters before the numbers A1B1234567890  less than 4 characters before the numbers A1 B1234567890  space amidst the first 4 characters instead of at the endcodep

Negative 2293 pI am in the process of altering an existing GitLab installation to use SAML rather than LDAP for authentication. p  pAt this point, users can successfully sign into the Web application using the Sign in with Saml button. I am unclear, however, about what seems to be a difference between the LDAP and SAML approaches users with accounts created via an LDAP signin can then access Git repositories e.g. using clone, push, ... using their LDAP usernames and passwords, but users with accounts created via a SAML signin cannot. p  pThrough experimentation, Ive found that users can access the Git repositories if they use the GitLab UI to set a separate GitLab account password on the account that is created during the initial SAML interaction. I was pointed in this direction by a GitLab message that appeared after creating a project under one of the new user accounts You wont be able to pull or push project code via HTTPS until you set a password on your account. p  pIt seems possible that this separate password configuration is only necessary because Ive misconfigured the SAML integration somehow. So, my question is whether I am wrong to expect that authenticating access to the GitLabhosted Git repositories would work the same regardless of whether SAML or LDAP is used If not, does anyone know of relevant SAML configuration settings that I should reviewp  pIn case its of interest I have posted a similar question to the GitLab Google group, but I have not received any responses there yet.p
