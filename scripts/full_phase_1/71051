Positive 71051 pI have a MVC project with 2 areas Admin and Client. I also have a login page in the main controller. What I want to do is to Authenticate a user based on its roles. If the user is for client they cant login to admin and the other way around.  For example if you try Localhostadmin, the code checks if the user is authorised. If not it redirects you to LocalhostadminAccountLogin. The same for Localhostclient to Localhostclientaccountlogin. I want to use a customAuthorize rather than [AuthorizeRolesAdmin]. p  peverything works fine if I dont use roles, but the problem is if you login as client you can simply change the url and go to admin.

Positive 71051 pIm new to LinqtoSQL and ASP.NET MVC.p  pIs there any way to use stored procedures in LinqtoSQL using ASP.NET MVCp  pOR is it feasible to use stored procedures with LINQ in ASP.NET MVCp  pI want to use CTE inside my stored procedures.p  pPlease give your suggestions to achieve this.p
Positive 71051 pIm attempting to use a hrefhttpscode.google.comppgprovider relnofollow titlepgProviderpgProvidera as part of a move to Postgresql to get membership working in a .NET MVC4 web app, however I keep encountering the following errorp  precodeERROR 42P01 relation versions does not exist codepre  pSo far Ive set up the web.config as suggested and confirmed that the provider is successfully connecting to the database using .NET Reflector. Ive narrowed the issue down to the codeValidateVersioncode function within the a hrefhttpscode.google.comppgprovidersourcebrowsetrunkpgProviderDDLManager.cs relnofollowDDLManager.csa file in pgProvider.p  pEssentially what is happening is pgProvider is trying to check if it should autocreate the membership tables by checking if the tables already exist. However the way in which it does this is by running this queryp  precodeselect count from pgtables where schemaname  public and tablename  versions codepre  pAnd then tries to parse the result into an int, returning the bool from codeint.TryParsecode as the indicator of whether the table exists or not. But because the result that is being returned is 0 instead of NULL which I assume is what pgProvider expects if there is no table, it always evaluates to true...because obviously 0 is an int. Therefore, it thinks all the tables exist and tries to run on a query on the versions table which hasnt been created.p  pSo Im not sure if its an issue with my database returning 0 when it should return NULL or if its an issue with pgProvider not actually looking at what is returned. Where should I go from herep

I do not understand how to get the form to call the controller and do its processing inside that controller. Instead, it goes to an error looking for the results page, which i understand comes from the BeginForm method. So in essence, how can i get my form to pass the number entered into the search box to my controller functionp

Positive 71051 pI have a guest list and it is working using a viewmodel, paging, searching, etc.p  pI would like to be able to select a guest, and show everyone at the table on the same view in a separate column.  I understand how to do it by refreshing the entire page I can just send the table number to the controller and filter based on that.  I would prefer to do it in a partial view.p  pOne problem I am encountering among others is the current page is filtering based on a search criteria, so if I pass the current set of Guest model data it wont include everyone at the table because of the filtered data.p  pHow can I call another action and render it on a partial viewp  pI am trying something like this but my view is crashing wont even display so I dont know where to start troubleshooting.

Positive 71051 pIn an ASP.NET MVC project, I have a controller method that accepts POST requests, like so with the User class for completenessp  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult TestMethodUser user      return ContentIt worked   public class User      public string Name  get set      public string Email  get set   codepre  pI call this method with jQuery Ajaxp  precode.ajax     url testTestMethod,     data JSON.stringify user  name NewUserName, email usernameemail.com  ,     type POST,     success function data          alertdata     ,     error function xhr          alerterror       codepre  pWhen I create a fresh ASP.NET MVC project, and include this code in a new Test controller, everything works fine. Viewed through Fiddler, a single POST request is made, and I get the controller method return value back. p  pHowever, when I run this code in the current MVC project that Im developing, it doesnt work. From Fiddler I see that the ajax call first initiates a POST method, that gets a 301 http status error moved permanently. Immeditely afterwards a GET request is made, which generates a 404 not found error which makes sense as there is no GET action method with this name available.p  pSo I use the exact same code, in a fresh projects and in the existing project, but the code only works in the fresh project. So clearly theres something about my existing project that somehow prevents this from running properly and causes the odd behaviour of generating both a POST and a GET request. But I have no idea what it could be, so any suggestions welcome...p  pUpdate  routing informationp  precodepublic static void RegisterRoutesRouteCollection routes    routes.AppendTrailingSlash  true   routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes   routes.MapRoute   name Default,       url controlleractionid,       defaults new  controller  Home, action  Index, id  UrlParameter.Optional   codepre  pUpdate 2  Looks like this issue is caused by Content Security Policy settings that were switched on for this project. p

And theyre about   20 that live outside China in zoos.   They exist almost entirely on bamboo.   They can live to be 30 years old. And   these little guys will eventually get   much bigger. Theyll growp blockquote  pAs you can see, it is starting with a period and ending on a word character Its almost as if the fragments are just coming out as they will and the regex isnt doing anything at all, but the results are different when I use the gap fragmenter. In the above result I dont see any reason why it shouldnt have stripped out the preceding period and the last two words, there is plenty of room in the slop and in the regex pattern. Please help me figure out what Im doing wrong...p  pThanks a lot,p  pMarkp

Negative 71051 pIm doing some Javascript scripting with InDesign Server at the moment. Im having trouble trying to reliably detect overflows in TextFrames, after changing formatting or placing XML into them.p  pFor example, Ive got a function that shrinks a 4 column TextFrames height until the text overflows the frame. Then it increases the height until it no longer overflows. This should result in as close to equal column heights as possible.p  precodewhilebodyTextFrame.overflows    var bounds  bodyTextFrame.geometricBounds   bodyTextFrame.geometricBounds  [bounds[0], bounds[1], bounds[2]  1, bounds[3]]   app.consoleoutshrinking   whilebodyTextFrame.overflows    var bounds  bodyTextFrame.geometricBounds   bodyTextFrame.geometricBounds  [bounds[0], bounds[1], bounds[2]  1, bounds[3]]   app.consoleoutexpanding  codepre  pIn InDesign desktop this works fine with some modifications to make it use the currently selected object, but in InDesign Server this seems to overshoot during the shrinking phase, and then only expand once. p  pA similar problem also occurs after placing XML into a TextFrame and then detecting whether that text has caused an overflow. If I check for the overflow directly after placeXML, it always returns false, but if I check for the overflow at a later part of the script, it detects it correctly.p  pIts a bit like theres a delay in calculating whether the text overflows, but it carries on through the script regardless until the overflow property is updated on the TextFrame.p  pIs there a way of forcing the script to wait until the overflow property has been updated Or setting the mode of the script to wait for the refresh Or am I just doing it wrongp

Negative 71051 pI want to have the advantage of functional data structures multiple versions of data that can share structure but be able to modify it in an imperative style. p  pWhat Im thinking about and a possible use a RPG game in which whole game history is stored for example, to allow for travelling back in time. Using copyonwrite, I could simply clone the structure holding game state and modify it by introducing a new turn  but have access to the earlier turns not necessarily all of them, maybe just selected snapshots of game state, without the penalty of having to copy everything every time.p  phr p  pLets say codefoocode is a map.p  precodebar  foo.clone codepre  pNothing of codefoocodes structure for example, tree gets copied yet. However, from now on codebarcode is treated as a copy and no changes are allowed to propagate  back to foo.p  precodebaz  bar[someKey] baz.modifyInSomeWay codepre  pNowp  ul lia new object gets created, that is a modified copy of codebazcode.li licodebarcode is replaced with a new map, holding new codebazcode possibly retaining  some of codefoocodes structure.li licodefoocode is unaffected.li ul  pBut if we then do...p  precodebaz.modifyAgain codepre  p...codebazcode can be just modified, because we have a recent version of it. codebarcode doesnt need to be changed.p  pAll this requires holding some version information about codefoocode and codebarcode,  increasing it on codefoo.clonecode, and passing it to codebazcode somehow by making it a proxy object. p  pAlso, any part of structure that has been cloned becomes a part of history and cant be changed anymore, which could be enforced at runtime.p  phr p  pThis resembles JavaScripts prototypes a bit, but I its more as it allows for changes  to propagate upwards. I think it would be something like a version control system.p  ul liHas this been done, and to what extentli liIs this a good idea If not, is there a way to save itli liHow could it be implemented I was thinking about building it on top of some highlevel GCed language, like Python.li ul

Negative 71051 pId like to dynamically create a module from a dictionary, and Im wondering if adding an element to codesys.modulescode is really the best way to do this.

Im still interested in learning how to do this though, since a it has other potential applications and b Im not sure exactly how to use objects with the Timer constructor doing so may prove to be less appropriate than this approach in some circumstances.p  h3EDITSREVELATIONSPHOOEYSEUREKAEh3  ol lipIve realized that the example code relating to running timing tests wont actually work, because codeimport code only works at the emmoduleem level, and the context in which that statement is executed is that of a emfunctionem in the codetestitcode module.  In other words, the globals dictionary used when executing that code is that of codemaincode, since thats where I was when I wrote the code in the interactive shell.  So that rationale for figuring this out is a bit botched, but its still a valid question.pli lipIve discovered that the code run in the first set of examples has the undesirable effect that the namespace in which the newly created modules code executes is that of the module in which it was emdeclaredem, strongemnotemstrong emits own moduleem.  This is like way weird, and could lead to all sorts of unexpected rattlesnakeic sketchiness.  So Im pretty sure that this is strongnotstrong how this sort of thing is meant to be done, if it is in fact something that the Guido doth shine upon.pli lipThe similarbutsubtlydifferent case of dynamically loading a module from a file that is not in pythons include path is quite easily accomplished using codeimp.loadsourceNewModuleName, pathtomodulemoduletoload.pycode.  This does load the module into codesys.modulescode.  However this doesnt really answer my question, because really, what if youre running python on an a hrefhttpthedailywtf.comArticlesThecbitmap.aspxembedded platform with no filesystemapli ol  pIm battling a considerable case of information overload at the moment, so I could be mistaken, but there doesnt seem to be anything in the codeimpcode module thats capable of this.p  pBut the question, essentially, at this point is how to set the global ie module context for an object.  Maybe I should ask that more specifically  And at a larger scope, how to get Python to do this while shoehorning objects into a given modulep

Negative 71051 pSix years ago, I burned several days trying to hunt down where my perfectly deterministic framework was responding randomly. After meticulously chasing the entire framework ensuring that it was all using the same instance of Random, I then kept chasing by single stepping code. It was highly repetitive iterative selfcalling code. Worse, the damn effect would only show up after a huge number of iterations were completed. And after 6 hours, I was finally at wits end when I discovered a line in the javadoc for HashSet.iterator indicating it doesnt guarantee the order in which it will return elements. I then went through my entire code base and replaced all instances of HashSet with LinkedHashSet. And lowandbehold, my framework sprang right to deterministic life ARGHp  pI have now just experienced this same FREAKIN affect, again at least it was only 3 hours this time. For whatever reason, I missed the small detail that HashMap happens to BEHAVE THE SAME WAY for its keySet.p  pHeres an SO thread on this subject, although the discussion never quite answers my question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2704597iterationorderofhashsetIteration order of HashSetap  pSo, I am curious as to why this might occur. Given both times I had a huge single threaded java application crawling through exactly the same instantiationinsertion space with exactly the same JVM parameters multiple runs from the same batch file on the same computer with almost nothing else running, what could possibly perturb the JVM such that HashSet and HashMap would, after an enormous number of iterations, behave unpredictably not inconsistenly as the javadoc says not to depend upon the orderp  pAny ideas around this from either the source code implementation of these classes in java.util or from your knowledge of the JVM perhaps some GC affect where internal java classes get nonzeroed memory when allocating internal memory spacesp

Negative 71051 pstrongEDIT Figured out the problem. Also if you found this through google or another search engine here is where I went wrong and how to fix it.strongp  pMy deleteNode method was moving through the list properly with the correct temp and keeping the head untouched. Where I was going wrong was in what I was returning as the result of the method. I was returning either temp or newNode which is incorrect because it goes through the list until it finds defined position. Once it finds that defined position it it would reassign the next pointer to point to the nextnext pointer which is correct but again I was returning the wrong thing. Because we had moved through the list using tempNewNode we lost the header and we were returning the position we found and whatever was still in the next positions of the list.p  pHow we fix this is returning the head which is what is passed into the method. The reason why this works is because we have to understand how LinkedLists work. The pointers of each node point to the next node. Ex. we have a linked list Aem  Bem  Cem  Dem  Eem  Femp  pIf we want to delete Node C we move to node B using the temp pointer and then assign the Bnext to tempnextnext Thus skipping over C node and assigning D node. p  pNOTE From what I know this does not actually free the memory of C node so it isnt best practice because you can cause memory leaks this way You should use the free method on the C node.p  pHere is the code I ended up usingp  precodestruct node DeleteNodestruct node head, int pos        struct node temp  head      int length  LinkedListLengthtemp      int i      ifpos lt 0  pos gt length         printfERROR Node does not existn     else         ifpos  1             head  headgtnext move from head 1st node to second node         else             fori  1 i lt pos1 i move through list                     temp  tempgtnext                          tempgtnext  tempgtnextgtnext                   return head  codepre  pHopefully that helps understand how I went out fixing it. p  pbr br ORIGINAL POSTbr br   p  pEDIT strongNote This is a homework assignment I have spent a few days estimated 4 hours programming it I am just stuck on this one part.

Negative 71051 pI am writing an app for iOS that uses data provided by a web service.  I am using core data for local storage and persistence of the data, so that some core set of the data is available to the user if the web is not reachable.p  pIn building this app, Ive been reading lots of posts about core data.  While there seems to be lots out there on the mechanics of doing this, Ive seen less on the general principlespatterns for this.  p  pI am wondering if there are some good references out there for a recommended interaction model.p  pFor example, the user will be able to create new objects on the app.  Lets say the user creates a new employee object, the user will typically create it, update it and then save it.  Ive seen recommendations that updates each of these steps to the server  when the user creates it, when the user makes changes to the fields.  And if the user cancels at the end, a delete is sent to the server.  Another different recommendation for the same operation is to keep everything locally, and only send the complete update to the server when the user saves.p  pThis example aside, I am curious if there are some general recommendationspatterns on how to handle CRUD operations and ensure they are syncd between the webserver and coredata. p  pThanks much.p

Negative 71051 pIn recent days ive been looking into a way to mix together MP3 files at the point of upload to a website, which is hosted on a linux machine.p  pSo far, thanks to the community, ive learned that using SoX over the command line is probably the most efficient way to actually produce a mixed file from two sources.  I have also discovered that Audacity may also be useable for the purpose.p  pUnfortunately, both of these programs being free  they do not support the MP3 format due to legal issues around patents and licensing.  I know that support can be added with LAME, however this still remains illegal because LAME is also free and is not licensed by the patent owners.p  pSo Im looking for a way to add MP3 encoderdecoder support to Sox, Audacity or a similar commandline enabled program, so that it can be used legally within a commercial website.

E.g.     var       CreateSomeOtherService functionaValue stringp  p2 Faster no lookups necessary in a containerp  p3 Simplierp  pThis is how I would use itp  precodeunit uBusiness interface [...] implementation  uses    uSomeServiceIntf [...] procedure TMyBusinessClass.DoSomething var   someService ISomeService begin   someService  CreateSomeService   someService.SomeMethod end  end. codepre  pWhat would be your reasoning to use a DI framework instead of this approachp  pHow this would look like using a DI frameworkp  pAs far as I know if you would use a DI framework than you would register the concrete class against the interface and then consumers of the system would ask an implementation for the given framework. So there would be a registering callp  precodeDIFramework.RegisterISomeInterface, TSomeInterface codepre  pand when you need an ISomeInterface implementation you can ask the DI framework for itp  precodevar   someInterface ISomeInterface begin   someInteface  DIFrameWork.GetISomeInterface as ISomeInterface codepre  pNow obviously if you do need to pass parameters to create an ISomeInterface the whole thing gets more complicated with the DIFramework but simple with the approach described above.p

Negative 71051 pFor a couple of days now Ive tried to figure out why my nineslice code does not work as expected. As far as I can see, there seems to be an issue with the Graphics.DrawImage method which handles my nine slice images incorrectly. So my problem is how to compensate for the incorrect scaling that is performed when running my code on the compact framework. I might add that this code of course works perfectly when running in the full framework environment. The problem only occurs when scaling the image to a larger image not the other way around.

After hours of scouring the internet I have come to the conclusion that no happy conclusion has been made.  Yet I believe this must be a fairly common roadblock for those who are trying to do paging and sorting with ASP MVC. I understand that the property can not be mapped to sql and therefore you cannot sort on it before paging, but what I am looking for is a way to get my desired result.p  pRequirements for a perfect solutionp  ul liDRY, meaning my total calculations would exist in 1 placeli liSupport both sorting and paging, and in that orderli liNot pull the whole table of data into memory with .AsEnumerable or .AsArrayli ul  pWhat I would be really happy to find is a way to specify the Linq to entities SQL in my extended partial class.  But I have been told this is not possible.  Note that a solution does not need to directly use the Total property.  Calling that property from IQueryable is not supported at all.  I am looking for a way to achieve the same result via a different method, yet equally simple and orthogonal.p  pThe winner of the bounty will be the solution with the highest votes at the end, unless someone posts a perfect solution p  pstrongIgnore below unless until you read the answersstrongp  pstrong1strong Using Jaceks solution I took it one step further and made the properties invokable using LinqKit.  This way even the .AsQueryable.Sum is enclosed in our partial classes.  Here is some examples of what I am doing nowp  precodepublic partial class Line      public static ExpressionltFuncltLine, Decimalgtgt Total              get                      return l gt l.Price  l.Quantity                 public partial class Invoice      public static ExpressionltFuncltInvoice, Decimalgtgt Total              get                      return i gt i.Lines.Count gt 0  i.Lines.AsQueryable.Sum Line.Total   0                 public partial class Customer      public static ExpressionltFuncltCustomer, Decimalgtgt Balance              get                      return c gt c.Invoices.Count gt 0  c.Invoices.AsQueryable.Sum Invoice.Total   0                codepre  pFirst trick was the .Count checks.  Those are needed because I guess you cannot call .AsQueryable on an empty set.  You get an error about Null materialization.p  pWith these 3 partial classes laid out you can now do tricks likep  precodevar customers   from c in repository.Customers.AsExpandable                            select new CustomerIndex                                                            Id  c.Id,                                Name  c.Name,                                Employee  c.Employee,                                Balance  Customer.Balance.Invoke c                                                  .OrderBy c gt c.Balance .ToPagedList page  1, PageSize   var invoices   from i in repository.Invoices.AsExpandable                          where i.CustomerId  Id                           select new InvoiceIndex                                                      Id  i.Id,                             Attention  i.Attention,                             Memo  i.Memo,                             Posted  i.Created,                             CustomerName  i.Customer.Name,                             Salesman  i.Salesman.Name,                             Total  Invoice.Total.Invoke i                                                    .OrderBy i gt i.Total .ToPagedList page  1, PageSize  codepre  pVery cool.p  pThere is a catch, LinqKit does not support the invocation of properties, you will get an error about trying to cast PropertyExpression to LambaExpression.  There are 2 ways around this.  Firstly is to pull the expression yourself like sop  precodevar tmpBalance  Customer.Balance var customers   from c in repository.Customers.AsExpandable                            select new CustomerIndex                                                            Id  c.Id,                                Name  c.Name,                                Employee  c.Employee,                                Balance  tmpBalance.Invoke c                                                  .OrderBy c gt c.Balance .ToPagedList page  1, PageSize  codepre  pwhich I thought was kind of silly.  So I modified LinqKit to pull out the get value when it encounters a property.  The way it operates on the expression is similar to reflection, so its not like the compiler is going to resolve Customer.Balance for us.  There is a 3 line change I made to TransformExpr in ExpressionExpander.cs.  Its probably not the safest code and might break other things, but it works for now and I have notified the author about the deficiency.  p  precodeExpression TransformExpr MemberExpression input          if input.Member is System.Reflection.PropertyInfo                       return Visit Expression System.Reflection.PropertyInfoinput.Member .GetValue null, null                     Collapse captured outer variables         if input  null codepre  pIn fact I pretty much guarantee that this code will break some things, but it works at the moment and that is good enough. p

Negative 71051 pI am trying to load a number of resources in a Java webstart application.p  pI had originally tried to load these usingp  precodeClassLoader loader  MyClass.class.getClassLoader URL url  loader.getResourceresourceName File file  new Fileurl.toURI codepre  pBut this didnt work  it threw an IllegalArgumentException. Further research suggested that this approach doesnt work with accessing resources from jar files, and that I need to use the following approachp  precodeClassLoader loader  MyClass.class.getClassLoader InputStream in  loader.getResourceAsStreamresourceName codepre  pHowever, I get odd results when I run this using from the Jnlp. If I run the followingp  precodepublic static void mainString[] args throws IOException, URISyntaxException    ClassLoader loader  MyClass.class.getClassLoader   String r  resourceName   URL url  loader.getResourcer   System.out.printlnurlnull   InputStream in  loader.getResourceAsStreamr   System.out.printlninnull  codepre  pIn my IDE, I get true amp true as I would expect. Running from the jnlp, I get true for the URL, but false for the InputStream.p  pAny ideas on what I might be doing wrong Are there better ways of loading resources for use in the java webstart applicationp  pEdit For info, my resources are in MyProjectsrcmainresources, and when the jar is generated, the resources are in the jar root.p

Negative 71051 pI want to have a button that responds to the Touch.FrameReported Up amp Down events instead of the usual MouseDown and MouseUp events that would be used so this button can be used at the same time on Windows Phone as another button.br I already have a custom Button control with a MouseDown and MouseUp state, but am unsure how to make the Up and Down events there trigger the correct look  probably something with the VisualStateManager needs set but cannot figure out how to use it  solution needs to use the standard Button control as Im merely extending it for the two states  as a button control with a normal and pressed state.br This is for a game screen within a larger Silverlight project, the rest of the project is standard Silverlight with the standard buttons and their normal behaviour, however in one place this needs to be Multitouch so this cannot be an XNA project instead as this would require porting 99 of the app to XNA where other features used are not supported  Ive been able to extend custom controls to support multitouch but want the button to react this way too  plus Im sure this will be of use to others, especially as this will most likely apply to Windows 78 development too.p  hr  pEdit Here is the Code and Generic.xaml for my button with the normal behaviour OnMouseUpOnMouseDownp  pCodep  precodeusing System.Windows using

Negative 71051 pHow can I achieve in Maven that when executing mvn install from the command line will automatically decide to build the artifact jarwar only if that artifact has not already been installed in the local repositoryp  pIve already tried with profiles, the problem here is that in the activation task I cannot reference my local repository through a Maven property. I cannot hardcode the local repository as that would break my build in a different environment.p  pI also tried a workaround by touching a file in a previous phase, e.g. initialize and then check for the existence of the file as activation condition, but this doesnt work because the activation condition is evaluated before the initializing is performed.p  pAny hints or ideas how to solve this problemp  pThanks, Peterp

I call this method on forms shown event. I didnt wanted combo boxes to be selected, so I used SelectionStart property of combo box, like thisp  precodemyComboBox1.SelectionStart  myComboBox1.Text.Length codepre  pThat way, none of the combo boxes appears to be selected. But, another problem has arised I see only end of the selection on my combo boxes. If the first item is short, then everything is cool.

I wanna see C is a very good programming.p  pI cant move the SelectionStart property to 0, because all of my combo boxes gets selected again. And even if I do that, I still see end of the first item, not the start  the only difference is that item is selected.p  pAny idea how to see the text of the first item from the startp

Negative 71051 pIm working on editing a tooltip plugin TooltipsY to use a div instead of the title element for the content of the tooltip. Im doing this for a multitude of reasons, the primary one being so I can have HTML in my tooltips without causing validation errors.p  pThe problem Im having is that when changed the content of the tooltip to be the div instead of the title attribute, every link with a tooltip shows the same tooltip content. Thats because The divs arent related to the links in any way so I cant use this to select them.p  pIt would work if I knew some way to change codediv.showtip.htmlcode to codethis.closestdiv.showtip.htmlcode that method wont work because the div isnt a parent or a child of the link so how can I make the tooltip content the closest div to the link thats being hovered overp  pHere is my example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsgCCD2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netsgCCD2ap  pstrongNotestrong The only thing that should need to be changed is the value of the variable showtip.p  pAlso, I dont want a suggestion for a different tooltip plugin, Im doing this just as much for my own personal experience as I am to improve the functionality of the plugin.p
Negative 71051 pThis question refers to both the iOS SDK and JS API for Google Analytics.p  pLets say a mobile device opens my application or views my webpage, and I want to note certain things, for example, the devices model, firmware version, and application version. It sets these as custom variables with the visitor scope.p  pI know I can find out how many devices of one model there are, or how many devices on one firmware version there are, but can I determine how many devices are of a specific model emandem on a specific firmware version Or how many devices are on a specific firmware version with a certain version of my applicationp  pI know this should technically be possible cookies in mobile web, and UDIDs on devices, but I have not seen this anywhere and would like to confirm that it is in fact possible, and before I commit to using Google Analytics for statistic collecting. Please note, I am not looking for any other solution that can do this, there are plenty, I am asking if Google Analytics can do it in its current state. I think Google Analytics would be cool, because in order to buy my application, users have to view a webpage that I host. I could then compare the webpages statistics to the applications statistics and gain some sort of useful data, all in one place.p

Negative 71051 pI am considering using AppFabric caching feature for one of our projects. We have a need for distributed caching feature and it seems AppFabric is a good solution. However, I have a few questions which I hope will be answered here.p  pWe are considering to host AppFabric Cache server on the same machine where our web application is installed. I have found on MSDN article stating that AppFabric should be installed on a dedicated machine. It is also noted there that AppFabric can be installed on the same machine as application itself but some issues should be considered quote from articlep  blockquote   pWindows Server AppFabric cache hosts should be dedicated to the caching service, which means that those servers are not also used as application, web, or database servers. It is possible to use nondedicated cache servers in a cluster, but this scenario is not supported. Despite this policy, if you decide to use nondedicated cache hosts, make sure to properly estimate and test the configuration for each cache host to allow enough memory and network resources for both the caching service and all other services on the machines. Also understand that spikes in processor and network utilization by other services will negatively impact the performance and stability of the cache cluster.p blockquote  pHere is a link to this article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee790954.aspxArticle 1ap  pNow, this sounds reasonable enough, I was thinking that limiting amount of RAM AppFabric cache can use would be enough. But, reading another article on MSDN I have found thisp  blockquote   pFor both physical and virtual machines, you should note the location of the cache cluster to the application or web servers that use the cache. If they are in separate data centers, make sure that the latency between those datacenters will not negatively affect your performance. At this stage it might be tempting to use your application or web servers for your cache servers. Although possible, this is not supported. First, any resource usage spikes by services such as IIS on those machines could impact the cache cluster. strongSecond, the caching service assumes that it is on a dedicated server and can potentially use more much more memory than you specify.strongp blockquote  pHere is a link to this article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarygg186017.aspxArticle 2ap  pIf I understand correctly statement above, this means that despite my config settings for AppFabric, it will take as much RAM as it wants Can this be really true Has anyone some experience with configuration where application and AppFabric are located on the same machinep

What Id need to pass would be the keyname to the my codeobjectgtgetcode method.p  pThe reason I want to do this is so that I can trigger errors in a log file showing me where the deprecated calls to codeobjectgtsettings[]code are without breaking the application. Obviously setting setting to private would give me lots of fatal errors and I could work through but there are multiple developers working on this codebase which Id prefer not to break.

Negative 71051 pI have some simple scripts that allow me to change where certain versions of applications are used at runtime that are coded in to my .bashrc file.p  pFor example, lets say I have the cat application. There are two versions, one in testworking and another in testbeta.p  pIf I run a bash command, changer.sh, it changes the symbolic link in bincat to point to either testbetacat or testworkingcat. When working in terminals and within Konsole or Xterm, this works fine.p  pI also have a line in my .xinitrc so that X applications can see this environment variable as well, but there is a problem it seems that XorgXfree86 dereferences the symbolic link when Xorg starts up, so, for the entire duration of my Xsession, cat is resolved as testworkingcat, and never reevaluates the symbolic link if it changes later on. It seems the only workaround at this time is to close and restart Xorg every time I change this symbolic link. Is it possible to force Xorg to reloadreparse my .xinitrc without having to restart it each timep  pThanksp
Negative 71051 pIm developing a asp.net MVC 3 web application project. The project is simple, it provides a web page listing stored procedures in sql server. when user selects a stored procedure and hit run buttong, it is invoked to execute in sql server and return some execution result. p  pMy stored procedure is logically divided into several steps, say 10 steps, each step prints a message like step 1 doing A..., step2 dong B..., until step 10 done or step 10 fail. with error message. p  pNow the question is how could I push theses step messages from sql server to web application, so that in web browser, user can see each step message get printed in realtime fashion I dont want the user just hang on to wait until stored procedure finishes and just see the final result message. I want them to see some kind of live execution of stored procedure, so that user is well updated of where the stored procedure is. Some stored procedures are quick and take few seconds to finish, some are very slow and take even 1 hour to finish. I search lots of info, the best i can see is model controller notifies view once theres change in model, but still need model controller to pull from sql server, I dont see any real push from sql server to web application. Your advice is highly appreciated.p

Negative 71051 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIn my application written in C, I have created 3 threadsp  ul liAnalysisThread or Producer  it reads an input file, parses it, and generates patterns, and enqueue them into codestdqueuecodesup1sup.li liPatternIdRequestThread or Consumer  it deque patterns from the queue, and sends them, one by one, to database through a client written in C, which returns pattern emuidem which is then assigned to the corresponding pattern.li liResultPersistenceThread  it does few more things, talks to database, and it works fine as expected, as far as CPU usage is concerned.li ul  pFirst two threads take 6080 of CPU usage, each takes 35 on average.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pI dont understand why some threads take high CPU usage.p  pI analyse it as follows  if it is the OS who makes decisions like a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiContextswitch relnofollowcontextswitcha, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiInterrupt relnofollowinterrupta, and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiScheduling28computing29 relnofollowschedulinga as to which thread should be given access to system resources, such as CPU time, then how come emsomeem threads in a process happen to use more CPU than the others It looks like emsomeem threads forcefully takes CPU from the OS emat gunpointem, or the OS has a real soft spot for some threads and so it is biased towards them from the very beginning, giving them all the resources it has. Why cant it be impartial and give them all equallyp  pI know that it is naive. But I get confused more if I think along this line  the OS gives access to CPU to a thread, based on the amount of work to be done by the thread, but how does the OS compute or predict the amount of work embeforeem executing it completelyp  pI wonder what are the causes for high CPU usage How can we identify them Is it possible to identify them just by looking at the code What are the toolsp  pIm using Visual Studio 2010.p  psup1. Ive my doubt about codestdqueuecode as well. I know that standard containers arent thread safe. But if exactly one thread enqueue items to queue, then is it safe if  exactly one thread deque items from it I imagine it be like a pipe, on one side you insert data, on the other, you remove data, then why would it be unsafe if its done simultenously But that is not the real question in this topic, however, you can add a note in your answer, addressing this.supp  pstrongUpdatesstrongp  pAfter I realized that my consumerthread was using busyspin which Ive fixed with a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms68629828vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowSleepa for 3 seconds. This fix is temporary, and soon I will use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms68240028vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowEventa instead. But even with a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms68629828vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowSleepa, the CPU usage has dropped down to 3040, and occasionally it goes up to 50 which doesnt seem to be desirable from the usability point of view, as the system doesnt respond to other applications which the user is currently working with.p  pIs there any way that I can still improve on the high CPU usage As said earlier, the producer thread which now uses most of the CPU cycles reads a file, parses packets of  some format in it, and generates patterns out of them. If I use sleep, then the CPU usage would decrease but would it be a good idea What are the common ways to solve itp

Negative 71051 pIm wondering in what situations one uses Cygwin to compile C code and when one would opt for MinGW.

For example, I could compile an application using the pthreads API for Windows, although Windows itself does not implement the API.li liMinGW Allows compiling Windows compliant C source code. So using the example from above, I could not use the pthreads API when compiling with gcc in MinGW but would be required to use the threads API offered by Windows. Instead of using the MinGW gcc compiler, I could also be using a different compiler, e.g. the one that comes with VC.li ul  pHowever, my understanding seems to be wrong, because I was able to compile a dummy program that included pthread.h with MinGW.

So the pattern isp  precodevalue1 ..value1 repeated 100 times value2 ..vlaue2 repeated 20 times value3 value3 repeated 60 times codepre  pIn column 2, the values do repeat sometimes, but the repetitions are not grouped one after the others.. So they could be millions of rows away.p  pAny suggestion on how to optimize in terms ofp  pcreating an index using primary keys reordering the columns in ascending order If yes how often Any other idea that you can think would speed it up     etc..p

Negative 71051 pGood morning guys, Ive an app that is designed to work both on smartphone and tablet. When it runs on tablet I want to zoom the text of my webview to allow users to read better the text and to fill all the empty space if its possible.p  pThis the code that Im using to do that trickp  precodeWebview Zoom             if UIUtils.isTabletgetActivity                  ifUIUtils.isICS                      webView.getSettings.setTextZoom130                  else                      int currentTextSizeIndex  lyricsView.getSettings.getTextSize.ordinal                     if  currentTextSizeIndex1 lt lyricsView.getSettings.getTextSize.values.length                          webView.getSettings.setTextSize lyricsView.getSettings.getTextSize.values[currentTextSizeIndex1]                                codepre  pSo I check if Im on a tablet and I check which OS version user is using. Infact from API Level 14 I can use a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwebkitWebSettings.htmlsetTextZoom28int29 relnofollowsetTextZooma that allow me to set the text zoom of the page in percent default 100. This solution is much much more scalable becaue I can for example give to the user the ability to increase or decrease the text as they want with 10 or 10 percent of step.p  pBefore API Level 14 I have to use a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwebkitWebSettings.htmlsetTextSize28android.webkit.WebSettings.TextSize29 relnofollowsetTextSizea that use an enum as parameter default NORMAL. TextSize is Enum for specifying the text size. SMALLEST is 50 SMALLER is 75 NORMAL is 100 LARGER is 150 LARGEST is 200p  pSo I can use only these 5 costants and its not so scalable but its the only way to give this feature to the 90 of the phones that dont have ICS D.p  pThe problem is that codewebView.getSettings.setTextSizeTextSize.LARGERcode acts in different ways when I show the text view in different tablets and its really not ok.p  pAt the moment Im testing on a Samsung Galaxy Tab and a Kindle Fire.

Negative 71051 pAt the moment Im stuck with the need to debug several functions in our system to determine if theyre working or not.p  pThe situation is basicly that Im left with someone elses CakePHP structure which makes me unable to know the code in and out. This is due to lack of time and lack of documentation.p  pI need to run tests on this system, however it will cause incorrect data on our reports page when I create new orders etc. This is not allowed and basicly theres a lot of models which saves data to the reports by simply creating other rows.p  pThe easiest solution here would be to make no report rows get created if Im logged in as a certain user. Then Id simply just do a condition and determine if I should insert the report row in the database or not. codeif booltester return FALSE else  Insert data codebr This would however require to fetch the Session data within the Model, which Ive read is a bad solution. I cant simply run an extra parameter in the function, since the function is called on so many places in so many files.p  pSo my question is basicly Should I include Session data within the Model regardless or is there any other nifty solution that makes me not insert these rows when Im testing.p  pDefining a session value through the controllers isnt a smooth solution either here.p

Negative 71051 pA minmax heap is a heap that can find both the minimum and the maximum element in codeO1code  and remove it in codeOlog ncode. It is closely related to a classic heap, but it actually interleaves three heaps a minheap and two maxheaps, where even levels are min levels and odd levels are max levels which thus have two roots. The classic heap properties hold with respect to grandchildren instead of children. The leaf level of the minmaxheap is essentially shared between the min and the max heaps, new elements inserted here can move both to even or to odd levels of the tree.p  pWhile the sift up and sift down are straightforward modifications, the tricky parts are when an elements needs to move from the minordered to the maxordered part of the heap.p  pFor a classic heap, I can bulkload the tree in codeOncode by performing a bottom up heap repair, while the obvious onebyone insertion takes codeOn log ncode time. I can also do this for bulk insertions, instead of inserting them one by one I can append them all and the bulkrepair the heap.p  pFor the minmax heap, I can of course linearly load it in codeOn log ncode, but I wonder if there also is a way of bulkloading it in codeOncode or bulkrepairing the heap bottomupp

Negative 71051 pSo I have an old dictionary on my pc, pretty old that I cannot find any track of its developer or the website I guess it hasnt even been released as an official software. I have a personal project of mine and I might need some of this words translated about 200300 and I see that inside the data folder that contains the databaselist of files but Im unable to extract or read this files. Is there any way to extract or convert these .bin files to a text format or something readable.p  pSo Im thinking maybe this type of .bin files are not like .bin or .iso cd files that you can mount and read and these .BIN FILES are just to be used inside an application only.p  pPlease help. This project is really highly important to mep  pThank you alot.p

Negative 71051 pIve been away from .NET desktop programming for some time, while drinking the Node.js koolaid.  There are some parts of Node.js I find easy to work with.

Ive created a standard Wix installer project which outputs a MSI that does all I want.p  pNow Ive created a custom UI in WPFXAML Win 8 style and a bootstrapper project that installs our projects using our own UI. The basics work just fine, i.e. installing and uninstalling.p  pI want to let the user change the install directory and the install scope per user or per machine through an advanced panel.

Negative 71051 pJust a quick query on the best databased structure to go with for a small application, [ the database will be SqlLite or MySql and the app written in PHP if that helps]p  pBasically my issue is that entries will have many options and these will be likely to be added to and removed so editing the db structure is probably not the best idea. I am just wondering what the best way to store this options to the data base. In similar situations in the past I have achieved this by storing the data serialised or in JSON format to a table row, but I am wondering if this is the best option, any advice would be great. p  pThe application is map based where a user can addremove markers, the markers have types [ eg shop, school, hospital etc. ] the user can also add and remove types.

Negative 71051 pFor my most recent project, I stumbled across the need to p  ul lidownload data in a blocking way to be started in a background threadli libut also progressively process the data as it is being received as the downloaded data could easily be 100M so it was not efficient to store it all in one big NSDatali ul  pI thus needed to use an asynchronous NSURLConnection object for being able to receive the data progressively but wrap it in a container that would block the calling thread in between two successive codeconnectiondidReceiveDatacode delegate calls, and until either codeconnectionDidFinishLoadingcode or codeconnectiondidFailWithErrorcode were called.p  pI thought I would share my solution as it took me well over a few hours to put together the right pieces of code found here and there on StackOverflow and other forums.p  pThe code basically launches a new codeNSURLConnectioncode on a background thread codedispatchgetglobalqueuecode, sets the run loop to be able to receive the delegates calls, and uses codedispatchsemaphorescode to block the calling and the background threads in an alternating way.

Negative 71051 pIn GDI, the Graphics object has a TransformPoints function which allows you to specify coordinate transforms for either device to world or world to device. In SharpDX I can take device independent coordinates and get them translated to my world with Matrix3x2.TransformPoint... but how can I go the other wayp  pAlternatively, what Im doing is through a series of transforms I end up drawing something on the screen which I only know about in current world coordinate but I want to draw a text label on it.

Negative 71051 pid like some opinions about the flow im building for any mobile application that needs to send a combination of user and password. My idea is to encrypt the password using AES256, generating a random passphrase and IV to generate the key. The idea is that when the password is first generated, it send to the server the encrypted password, and the IV. the IV and encrypted password will be stored at server, in a redis DB and the key, and the encrypted password, will be on the mobile device only the IV will not be stored on the device. So each time the user needs to login, sends the to the server, the encrypted password and the key, with the IV stored, the server decrypt both encrypted password sent and the one saved in the DB, using the key just sent and the IV already on server.p  pIn case the user wants to change their password, encrypted password, key and IV is generated again and is sent the old one too key and encrypted password if they match, the values are updated in server and send a notification to the client to update them too.p  pAll of this transactions will take place inside a SSL tunneling too.p  pDo you think this is secure if not why any other option to encryptdecrypt passwords in a secure way from a mobile device to a serverp  pRegards.  p

I think this is a problem with Facebook, unless Im missing something huge, but I dont see it....p  pstrongUPDATE 2252013strongp  pIve made progress, but theres still something weird going on. Martey set me straight on the using the og meta tags rather than just the  tag. The tutorial I had been following said to ignore the Open Graph warnings, but once I started paying attention to them, I got some good information. Like, it actually said that my image is too small and that it will use another image instead. Guess I should have paid attention p  pAnyway, so the issue was that the favicon is too small. According to the Open Graph warning, it needs to be 200 pixels in both directions. So I grabbed the actual header logo and tried to use that. Its 340 pixels wide. Oops, it was only 164 pixels tall.p  pSo I used The GIMP to set it onto a transparent background that was 200 pixels tall and tried again, but its still telling me its too small. Its no longer telling me that it needs to be 200 pixels. It just says that its too small.p  pIm stumped again...p  pstrongUpdate 2252013 Issue Resolvedstrongp  pThe problem was transparency. I filled the background in white and tried again and now its loading fine.p  pThanks for your help, Marteyp

For example, there are 4 entries for apples, 2 of them are rotten, so each row for apple should read 0.5. The target values purely as illustration are included in the desired outcome column.p  pI have previously approached this problem by   using the ddply command on the fruit variable with sumlenght as function, creating a new 32 dataframe   use the merge command to link these values back into the old dataframe.p  pThis feels like a roundabout way, and I was wondering whether there are betterfaster way of doing this ideallly a generic approach, that is easily adjusted if one instead of the percentage needs to determine whether e.g. all fruits are rotten, any fruits are rotten, etc. etc. etc.... p  pMany thanks in advance, p  pW p  precode    Fruit Rotten DesiredOutcomePercRotten 1   Apple      1                        0.5 2   Apple      1                        0.5 3   Apple      0                        0.5 4   Apple      0                        0.5 5    Pear      1                       0.75 6    Pear      1                       0.75 7    Pear      1                       0.75 8    Pear      0                       0.75 9  Cherry      0                          0 10 Cherry      0                          0 11 Cherry      0                          0  create example datagram desired outcome columns are purely inserted as illustrative of target outcomes FruitcrepApple,4,repPear,4,repCherry,3 Rottenc1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0 DesiredOutcomePercRottenc0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0,0,0 dfas.data.framecbindFruit,Rotten,DesiredOutcomePercRotten         df codepre

Negative 71051 pI have a problem that deals with optimization of a game that includes 2 players. So we have an undirected connected graph with a number of edges and some vertices. Each player has to remove edges and if a vertex is isolated his score increases by one and then you have to remove another edge.

Negative 71051 pIm trying to insert a new row into a MYSQL database. The problem is actually how to structure the insert string used to prepare statement. the new row being inserted has new values except for one column that was obtaining its value from another table. I was using H2 for testing and this is how I structured the String.p  precodeINSERT INTO RESERVATION CUSTOMERCODE,ROOMNUMBER,RESERVATIONDATE,STARTDATE,ENDDATE,   TOTALPRICE valuesselect CUSTOMERCODE FROM CUSTOMER where EMAIL,,,,, codepre  pI thought that the insert string would be the same for MYSQL, but its not working. I googled around and found this answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma260801788917httpstackoverflow.coma260801788917a. So I Changed the String top  precodeINSERT INTO RESERVATION    CUSTOMERCODE,ROOMNUMBER,RESERVATIONDATE,STARTDATE,ENDDATE,   TOTALPRICE select CUSTOMERCODE FROM CUSTOMER where EMAIL,,,,, codepre  pI think it somehow worked because the error changed. But now the MYSQL driver is telling me that there is still an error. Somehow its as if the quotation marks are more than required. this is the errorp  precodecom.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException You have an error in your    SQL syntax check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the     right syntax to use near A13,20130420,20130420,20130424,14000.0     at line ... codepre  pmeaning it has obtained the first valueCUSTOMERCODE properly from the other table but the rest of the values are quoted together which is what is bothering me. How can I solve this...p  pWhere is my mistakep  pI decided to write a method that would get me the customer code so that I can the insert statement without any select query. the string now looks like thisp  precodeINSERT INTO RESERVATION   CUSTOMERCODE,ROOMNUMBER,RESERVATIONDATE,STARTDATE,ENDDATE,TOTALPRICE   values, , , , ,  codepre  pBut now mysql driver is complaining like this...p  precodejava.sql.SQLException Parameter index out of range 2 gt number of parameters, which      is 1.  at com.mysql.jdbc.SQLError.createSQLExceptionSQLError.java1078 codepre  pWhich is surprising since I have put 6 question marks and not 1.  The error comes up at the second line from these lines where Im setting the values into the the codecode placeholders.p  precodepreStatement.setLong1, customer.getCustomerCode preStatement.setString2, reservation.getRoomNumber preStatement.setDate3, reservation.getReservationDate preStatement.setDate4, reservation.getStartDate preStatement.setDate5,reservation.getEndDate preStatement.setDouble6, reservation.getTotalPrice codepre  pSo why is it that the MYSQL driver is complaining about the number of parameters when look fine to me. or what am i overlookingp

Negative 71051 pI am making a little game in Windows Forms where my main character has to catch butterflies within a certain time limit. The character  moves with a KeyDown event of the arrow keys, there is a progress bar that shows elapsed time it fills with the Tick event of a timer and butterflies move around the screen randomly with the help of another timer. The form is repainted in the Tick event of the ButterflyMovement timer and in the KeyDown event.p  pMy main problem is that whenever I hold down any of the arrow keys, the progressbar stops filling and the butterflies stop moving. When I let go of the key, the pbar resumes its filling and the butterflies start moving again. I am guessing the problem has to do with the KeyDown event causing some kind of loop that stops the timers when the key is held down . How can I solve this so the timers keep ticking while a key is being held and, is this even the problem I suppose there must be a way, but I have a hunch that it might have something to do with the limitations of doing a game in WinForms.p

It creates huge mess since there are lots of files that need to be processed. p  pWhat I need is to extract particular sorted data from particular table. Like for example, I need the table called Voltage. The table consists of numerous cycles and each cycle has several rows also. The cycles usually go in chronological order, but in some cases time stamp get recorded with delay. Like cycles one first row can have later time than cycles 1 first row.

Negative 71051 pI hope there is a solution for my issue. Im using Extjs 4.1.  I have a viewport with a panel that allows to enter search parameters at the top and 2 tabs at the botton.  Both tabs have grids.  The grids on both tabs are very similar in the set up not the data. p  pThe grids support remote sorting and filtering and one also supports grouping. Both grids have stores with autoload  false, take 2 extra parameters date and type, buffered  true and pageSize  100.  p  pProxy type is rest.br Both grids are loaded at the same time when a search button in the top panel is clicked.  Search parameters are passed as extra parameters.p  pI set the ajax time out to 10 minutes.p  pSometimes when I click the search button at the top, one of the grids is stack with the Loading mask. Log file shows the controller is called and returns results fine. Looks like when the json is parced  the grid loading is halted. I wont be able to upgrade to a new version at this point.  p  pAny suggestions  May be how to detect when the load is hang and try again Thank you.p  pEDIT  Seems to be happening almost every time if I press search button and while I see loading mask on one of the tabs, I witch to another tab very fast.

Quarters of year are stored in Q1 and Q2. Q2 is kind of a reference quartervariable and the values always relate to year 2011. Now I want to pick those lines in dt, where, for each Person in K, Q1 lies in an interval of 4 quarters before the value of Q2. p  pstrongAn examplestrongbr Person A has value 3 in Q2, so values 2 2011, 12011, 42010, and 3 2010 should be picked. Considering this dataset, this would just be line 2. Value Q14 in line 3 is too large, value Q12 in line 1 is too small. For the second Person B, only line 6 would be chosen. Not line 4, because this is the same quarter as in Q2 I want only those smaller than the value in Q2, and line 5 is obviously greater than the value in Q2. p  precodedtnew    K    Y Q1 Q2 1 A 2010  3  3 2 B 2010  4  1 codepre  pstrongTo sum upstrongbr  A value of say 4 in Q2 would mean Pick all values in Q1 smaller than 4 where Y2011, and pick all values in Q1 equal or greater than 4 so just 4, where Y2010. result 32011,22011,12011,42010.

Inside of the tabbed view I have a lengthy bit of PHP code that grabs the system status information from a server and displays this information inside of one of the tabs, called system status, like sop  precode                   ltdiv idtabsgt                         ltulgt                             ltligtlta hreftabs1gtSystem Statusltagtltligt                          ltulgt                         ltdiv idtabs1gt                             ltphp Lengthy PHP script gt                     ltdivgt codepre  pNormally PHP loads so fast that you cannot tell that the PHP is being loaded before the jQuery UI tab is being loaded.  In this case, you will see some text being displayed as the browser loads the PHP script and fetches serverside info before the UI is loaded and it causes my GUI to look really nasty.p  pI have googled this issue and cannot figure out how to simply force the jQuery to code to execute BEFORE the PHP code, so that you will see my nice tabbed UI first while the PHP code executes within it.  Any help or point in the right direction would be great.  Oh, and I am also great at getting schooled and slapped in the face with hard computer science if I am completely missing something important here.  Thank you.p

But in ThreadPoolExecutor, using concept of core threads, max threads and prestartAllCoreThreads, number of threads on start up can be limited.p  pNow, p  p1 If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor always prefers adding a new thread rather than queuing. 2 If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new thread. 3 If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be rejected.p  p1st scenario is OK, but what I want is, when core threads are being utilized, instead of tasks getting queued upeven in case of bounded queue, say size 100 and waiting for core threads to be idle or queue to be full, a new thread be created from noncore pool quota. As in realtime, my application can not stand with idea of task waiting in queue.p  pso what I want is CoreThreads  NonCoreThreads  Queue instead of CoreThreads  Queue  NonCoreThreads.p  pi.e if core threads are being utilized, create new threads, and if pool size is maximum, then task should go in queue and wait for any thread to be free.p  pNow, one way of this is to extend ThreadPoolExecutor class and override execute method, but then I have to almost copy complete class. This is a dirty way I could think of. Can anyone suggest of any other way.p  pNote  I can not use cachedThreadPool, as number of threads need to be limited.p

Negative 71051 pHe there,p  pIm currently working on a serious game for a school project. In short, this game is supposed to help people with differtent types of hand arthritis and related diseases. The general idea is that the game will help the patint with moving their hands and fingers to keep them as healthy as possible.p  pThe fact is, that every patint is different, so each patint has different exercises they have to perform. We have thought about this problem and we think the best way to handle this, is to record exercises for each patint.p  pWe came up with the following idea. We created a web portal for doctors and physiotherapists. In here, they are able to create patint files. Each patint file has different information about that particular patint. Next to that, the doctor is able te record different exercises using the leap motion. I have used the jestPlay project to achieve this. So far, the doctortherapist is able to record an exercise for a particular patint and store this exercise as a .json file on the server.p  pIn addition to this, another part of the time is building a game in the Unity3D engine C. In this game, the player uses spells to clear the game. These spells are supposed to be the particular exercises the doctor recorded in the web application. When the patint logs in on the game, the .json file of the exercises will be send to the Unity3D engine. So far, so good.p  pOnce the .json file is in Unity, I use a json parser to put it into an objectarray. The data should be translated to a movement in leap motion a replay so to speak. Once the particular patint does the movementexercise the doctor initially recorded, then the spell is should complete.p  pNow, I have the following issues and I dont really know where to start to tackle this. I really hope there is someone that has dealed with something like this before and is ablewilling to help me out with it.p  pHow do I translate the data from the webapplication see a hrefhttpwww.yorickkeijzer.nlcotfapplicationexercise.json2 relnofollowhttpwww.yorickkeijzer.nlcotfapplicationexercise.json2a for an example to a leap motion replay  exercise  movement in Unityp  pHow do I make Unity recognize the diffent movementsexercises so compare the .json data from the web application with the real time leap motion data in unityp  pI hope, I have explained it clear enough. If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to ask them. p  pThanks a lotp

We have the ability to create codeThingyServercode objects, and it would be much faster and overall excellent to directly use ThingyServer objects instead of spinning up a daemon and having a ThingyClient connect to it over the network.  Since ThingyClient amp ThingyServer conveniently have the exact same methods, this should be easily possible.  But of course, Moose is demanding that I use a ThingyClient when the test eventually constructs a BlueWidget.p  pI did some research, and came across the MooseMeta documentation.

Negative 71051 pI am using a MySQL InnoDB database and have many tables in it. What I want to be able to do is enforce from within the database a constraint such that a key may exist in one of two columns in two separate tables but not both. Ill try to make this more clear.p  pSay I have two tables, TableA and TableB. Both of these tables have many columns, but they have one column in common, called SpecialID int 255.p  pNow, both of these tables have many rows, and from the PHP side of the web app, the SpecialID column in TableA should never contain an integer that is in the SpecialID column of TableB, and the same goes the other way around. In other words, an integer should never be able to be found in the SpecialID column of TableA strongandstrong TableB at any one time.p  pIm fairly confident that Ive enforced this from the PHP side, however I want to be able to enforce this relationship from within the database, just to be extra careful, as if I ever ended up with the same value in both tables, it would be catastrophic.p  pThis may not even be possible, but I thought Id throw it out there cos it seems like it emcouldem be. It would be sort of like a foreign uniqueness constraint. I have done a bit of research but havent turned up anything at all, not even people asking for something like this, so perhaps I could just be searching for the wrong thingp

Negative 71051 pSo I am trying to create a simple animation that takes the background from the initial color to the new color and back.p  pThe original issue I had is that I created a trigger on the MouseDownEvent that triggered the animation, but the user could trigger another animation before the first one finished. This new animation would animate from the current shade it was at to the new color and back. By progressively restarting the animation while the animation is going, the original color is lost.p  pThe easiest way to solve this is probably if i use the completed event for the animation. However, I dont like this solution because I want my animations to be in a custom style in resource dictionary and not part of the control itself. If the animation is in a custom style in a resource dictionary, then it wont have access to the code behind of the control itself.  Is there a good way to get an animation working while maintaining separation between the style and the control p  pI then had a different idea. The error is caused because I was animating from the border.background.color to a new color and back, thus if i started a new animation while the old one was going, the new animation started from whatever color value the prior animation was in.  But if I set the animation to go back to some saved property value of the original background color then I wont have the issue even if the user restarts the animation. p  precode ltResourceDictionary

Sometimes PHP is right, but way to often there is no mistake and when writing the exact same code again it works without whining. Copy and pasting the code does not work, it has to be typed again in full.p  pToday, I have meticulously typed down every character exactly as the line failing and then removing the old one, just to have the script working. For examplep  precode1    foreach POST[datapositions] AS k gt v  2     3     codepre  pthrew a parse error on line 1. I bumped the code down to row 2 and wrote the exact same line 1 again I check several times that every character is the same, then removing line 2, and it works. Another examplep  precode1    if isnumerick  2     3     codepre  palso fails on row 1. When I retype it, it works. Copy and pasting the line again does not work.p  pI am 100 certain the code is fine, so it leads me to believe its some kind of encoding issue and that certain parts of the code is attributed a bad encoding like pasting formatted text into a email.p  pIm currently using Sublime Text but have had the same types of mistaken parse errors in Notepad and the old Homesite editor as well, running MAMP on OS X, but it has happened on my Windows desktop machine as well.p  pDoes anyone have any clue what I can do Its super annoying to write the code several times and having it fail on you randomly.p  pEDIT reopened I still cant get it to work properly. No matter if I paste it to Notepad or if I type a completely new file from scratch. Ive checked all through the database to the server to my editor that they all use UFT8. Its almost always IFstatements that break sometimes I have to type them down 3 or 4 times before it works.

Negative 71051 pHi I have a problem with the structure of my code, it somehow goes into Circular Dependency. Here is an explanation of how my code looks likep  pI have a strongemProjectAemstrong contains strongBaseProcessorstrong and strongBaseProcessorstrong has a reference to a class called strongStructurestrong in strongemProjectBemstrong. Inside strongBaseProcessorstrong, there is an instance of strongStructurestrong as a variable.p  pIn strongemprojectBemstrong there are someother classes such as strongPricingstrong, strongTransactionstrong etc. Every class in strongemProjectBemstrong has a base class called strongBaseStructurestrong i.e. strongStructurestrong, strongPricingstrong and strongTransactionstrong classes all inherited from strongBaseStructurestrong. Now in strongPricingstrong and strongTransactionstrong classes, I want to call a method in strongBaseProcessorstrong class from strongBaseStructurestrong class which causing Circular Dependency.p  pWhat I have tried is br Using Unity, but I didnt figure out how to make it work because I try to use function like unityContainer.ReferenceTypeIBaseProcessor, BaseProcessor  in strongBaseStructurestrong then it will need a reference of strongBaseProcessorstrong which also cause Circular Dependency.p  pAnd Ive also tried creating an interface of strongIBaseProcessorstrong and create a functionthe function I want to call declaration in this interface. And let both strongBaseProcessorstrong and strongBaseStructurestrong inherit this interface. But how can I call the function in strongPricingstrong and strongTransactionstrong class without create an instance of strongBaseProcessorstrongp  pCan anyone please tell me how to resolve this problem other than using reflectionp  pAny help will be much appreciated.

Negative 71051 pIve been banging my head against the wall for hours trying to understand why cURLs cookie jar file was empty when I tried reading it. I just discovered that my code works if I call codecurlclosecode twice instead of once, however, and Im wondering if this is a bug with cURL.p  pHeres an examplep  precodecurlclosechInfo[handle] vardumpisresourcechInfo[handle] codepre  pThat outputs codeboolean truecode. So, in other words, the handle isnt closed, despite the fact that I called codecurlclosecode. p  pMy next thought was that maybe it takes some time for the handle to be closed, so I tried using codesleepcode for a few seconds after the codecurlclosecode call, but there wasnt any difference.p  pOut of desperation, I tried copying the codecurlclosecode line, like thisp  precodecurlclosechInfo[handle] curlclosechInfo[handle] vardumpisresourcechInfo[handle] codepre  pThat outputs codeboolean falsecode, meaning the handle is closed, and I am able to read from the cookie jar file cURL writes the cookies to the file when the handle is closed.p  pSo whats going on here This seems an awful lot like a bugp  pEDIT I cant post my full code you wouldnt want to read it anyway, but here is a simplified example note that only one url is fetched in this example, whereas in my real code codecurlmulticode is utilized to fetch many URLs simultaneouslyp  precodecurlOptions  array     CURLOPTUSERAGENT      gt Mozilla5.001 windows U NT4.0 enUS rv1.0 Gecko25250101,     CURLOPTCONNECTTIMEOUT gt 5,  the number of seconds to wait while trying to connect.

Negative 71051 pI have a slight problem where i might need some helpideas. I know the generic check whereby i set the onUpdate to check if my sprite is out of the screen viap  pIf Sprite.getX  camera width and remove it.p  pHowever, that will not work in my case.p  pMy sprites are being generated via a time handler and then set to move from point A to point B A being bottom of the screen to B being top of the screen. This is done so through a moveModifier.p  pUnfortunately in order to generate the idea of already have a constant motion, i spawn the sprites outside, so they appear to be zooming into the scene.p  pE.g. Game is in portrait mode, Camera width being 0 to 480 and height being 0 to 800.p  pThe coordinates are spawned randomly at e.g. 33, 810p  pIn this case, the point A is slightly outside the bottom of the screen and point B would be 33, 20 point B would be slightly outside the top of the screen.p  pWhen moveModifier is activated it starts to move the sprite.p  pBut by putting the out of the screen at the top of the onUpdate, it checks it every frame. Thus when the sprite is moving from pointA 33, 810 to become visible at 33, 800, the sprite itself is removed before being visible.p  pWhat i need to know if is there is anyway to prevent this removal BEFORE moveModifer is finished, OR to if there is another way to do it.p  pThanksp

Negative 71051 pIm building an AUGraph, and trying to get audio from the input device via an AVCaptureAudioDataOutput delegate method. p  pThe use of an AVCaptureSession is a consequence of the problem explained a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23836981haloutputinaugraphselectandconfigurespecificoutputdeviceherea. I succesfully managed to build an audio playthrough with this method via a CARingbuffer, as explained in the book emLearning Core Audioem.  But, getting data from the CARingbuffer implies to provide a valid sample time, and when I stop the AVCaptureSession the sample times from the AVCaptureOutput and the unit input callback are no more synced.

Negative 71051 pI would like to know the difference between the if else syntax and the  syntax. I saw an example on the web where they used a question mark instead of an if else statement. I understand that if statements can be used on only one linep  precodereturn true if 4 gt 3 codepre  pinstead of p  precodeif 4 gt 3   return true else   return false end codepre  pHowever, Im confused about when youd use a question mark in that case. Here is the example, I saw in a video.p  precodedate  params[month]  Date.parseparams[month]  Date.today codepre  pOn the surface this appears to be an alternative syntax for the if else statement. However, Ive never seen it before and have no idea what it does.p  pI also know that methods can end in a question mark, indicating it should return either a true or false value like sop  precodedef ismultipleof4 x   return true if x  4  0 end codepre  pHowever, the above syntax is different. I would love to learn what that means and what the difference is between that and if else statements.p

Negative 71051 pI want to know how codegrepcode works internally. Specifically I want to know whether finding the first match is significantly more faster than finding all matches For example, the first match occurs at the 10 point of the file from start and all matches spread all over the file. Then I think finding the first match only will make codegrepcode process much less file content than finding all matches in this case codegrepcode must traverse the whole file, compared to 10 of file in the earlier case. I want to know whether my assumption is correct because this possible improvement can vastly improve my processing work.  Thanks. p

Negative 71051 pI am a fairly experienced Android dev, teaching myself iOS, in android, you make a layout xml file for the user interface, and then you make a corresponding java class to control everything on that particular screen and manage transitions to other screens. This does not seem to be the way things work on iOS, for example, when I make a single view application from scratch, there are already ViewController.h and ViewController.m file there. But there is nothing in the code that relates those files to the view that is in the storyboard. And if I make another viewController, no new .h and .m files are created. The connection between the files and the storyboard screens is unclear, and that is what I am trying to figure out. p

So the editTag and cancelEditTag event function goes like thisp  precodescope.editTag  function      scope.originalTagName  scope.tag.name     element.htmlgetTemplatetrue     compileelement.contentsscope  scope.cancelEditTag  function      scope.tag.name  scope.originalTagName     element.htmlgetTemplatefalse     compileelement.contentsscope     scope.tagSubmitError  false     scope.errorMessage    codepre  pYet when profiling this app using Chrome dev tool, I realized while switching on and off edit mode by clicking edit and cancel edit button, the memory usage keeps climbing upabout 0.10.2mb each time, I think Ive got a memory leak here, my guess is that after compile, the old DOM hasnt been released If so, how should I deal with it If this is not the case, what else could be the troublemaker Or is it not a memory leak at all For the full context, below is the full code for my directivep  precodeapp.directivetaginfo, functioncompile ,http  var directive   directive.tagSubmitError  true directive.errorMessage   directive.originalTagName   directive.restrict  A  directive.scope       tag  ,     selectedTagIds  selected,  function getTemplateisEditing      if isEditing          return ltthgtltinput typecheckbox ngclickselectTag ngcheckedselectedTagIds.indexOftag.id  1gtltthgt                   ltthgt                       ltinput typetext classformcontrol ngmodeltag.name placeholdergt                       ltdiv classalert alertdanger stylemargintop 5px  ngshowtagSubmitError ngbinderrorMessagegtltdivgt                   ltthgt                   ltthgtltspan classlabel numpostgtlttag.numitemsgtltspangtltthgt                   ltthgtltbutton classactionsubmitedit ngclicksubmitEditTaggtlti classiconok2gtltigtltbuttongtampnbspampnbspltbutton classactioncanceledit ngclickcancelEditTaggtlti classiconbangtltigtltbuttongtltthgt      else          return ltthgtltinput typecheckbox ngclickselectTag ngcheckedselectedTagIds.indexOftag.id  1gtltthgt                   ltthgtlttag.namegtltthgt                  ltthgtltspan classlabel numpostgtlttag.numitemsgtltspangtltthgt                  ltthgtltbutton classactionedit ngclickeditTaggtlti classiconpencilgtltigtltbuttongtampnbspampnbspltbutton classactiondeletegtlti classiconbingtltigtltbuttongtltthgt       directive.template  getTemplatefalse directive.link  functionscope, element, attributes      scope.selectTag  function          var index  scope.selectedTagIds.indexOfscope.tag.id         if index  1              scope.selectedTagIds.pushscope.tag.id          else              scope.selectedTagIds.spliceindex, 1                   scope.submitEditTag  function          if scope.tag.name.length  0               scope.tagSubmitError  true             scope.errorMessage            else              http.postadminpostsedittag, tagId scope.tag.id, tagName scope.tag.name.successfunctiondata, status, headers, config                  if data.statusCode  error                      scope.tagSubmitError  true                     scope.errorMessage  data.errorMessage                  else if data.statusCode  success                      scope.tag.name  data.tagname                     scope.tagSubmitError  false                     scope.errorMessage                       element.htmlgetTemplatefalse                     compileelement.contentsscope                                                 scope.editTag  function          scope.originalTagName  scope.tag.name         element.htmlgetTemplatetrue         compileelement.contentsscope          scope.cancelEditTag  function          scope.tag.name  scope.originalTagName         element.htmlgetTemplatefalse         compileelement.contentsscope         scope.tagSubmitError  false         scope.errorMessage         return directive  codepre  pAny help will be appreciated, thanks in advancep

Negative 71051 pHey I am trying to statically define String values that change according to the configuration I am running.  So if I run a test configuration, it uses the test API url, but if I run a regular build, it statically sets the real API URL.p  pI am using two strings files right now, one in the main folder and one in the androidTest folder in Android Studio.

What did I get wrong Also, is there any way I could map the codesassupdatestylesheetscode to the phase codeprocessresourcescode, for instance, which would make more sense Lastly, if this all works, will Eclipses incremental build pick it upp  pHeres my pom.xml the relevant partsp  pp  precode    ...      ltpluginManagementgt         ltpluginsgt             ltplugingt                 ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.tomcat.mavenltgroupIdgt                 ltartifactIdgttomcat7mavenpluginltartifactIdgt                 ltversiongt2.2ltversiongt                 ltconfigurationgt                     ...                 ltconfigurationgt             ltplugingt              lt SASS processing gt             ltplugingt                 ltgroupIdgtorg.jasig.mavenltgroupIdgt                 ltartifactIdgtsassmavenpluginltartifactIdgt                 ltversiongt1.1.1ltversiongt                 ltexecutionsgt                     ltexecutiongt                         ltidgtgeneratecssltidgt                         ltphasegtpackageltphasegt                         ltgoalsgt                             ltgoalgtupdatestylesheetsltgoalgt                         ltgoalsgt                     ltexecutiongt                 ltexecutionsgt                 ltconfigurationgt                     ltuseCompassgttrueltuseCompassgt                     ltresourcesgt                         ltresourcegt                             ltsourcegt                                 ltdirectorygtbasedirsrcmainresourcesltdirectorygt                             ltsourcegt                             ltdestinationgtbasedirsrcmainwebappresourcesltdestinationgt                         ltresourcegt                     ltresourcesgt                 ltconfigurationgt             ltplugingt           ltpluginsgt     ltpluginManagementgt ltbuildgt codepre  pThanks in advance for your help. p

When the content is there it grows beyond the viewport and the footer is placed afterwards like youd expect.

My problem is the dropdown menu. I styled a little CSS caret, and when you scroll down and the header background activates, the caret is on top of the headers space, and you can see it behind the semitransperent header. EWW Tacky...p  pWhat Im wondering, is how can I target this element, as its an after pseudo class.. Heres the current CSS for the caret or top triangle as some call it.p  precodenav ul ulAfter  content  position absolute borderstyle solid borderwidth 0 10px 10px bordercolor rgba0,0,0,0.40 transparent display block width 0 zindex 1 top 10px left 20px  codepre  pI tried just using the same javascript with the nav ul ulAfter, but after researching, I learned how you cant add styles to a pseudo class. Duh, I knew that, just forgot. Thats all.  Any assistance on getting that little caret to go away when I scroll and the stick headers bg activates Would be a lifesaver for me. Also, if it can animate with the opacity transition like the header, that would rock. Once I figure out how to target it, I can add the css animation.p  pThanks a MILLION in advance I love StackOverflow.p

Negative 71051 pIm currently writing an android app in which in one fragment, the user enters in a time that they start their morning commute at, via the timepicker contained in a dialogfragment. That gets input into a GregorianCalendar object. When I check the objects toString method in both fragments, the settings I choose are in there, both the hour, minutes, and AMPM value. My problem comes that when I call the appropriate TextViews set text method, the hour always defaults to 12 every single time, even though in the GregorianCalendar objects toString method, all the values have been passed successfully. For some reason I keep losing specifically the hour when I call getTime. Im an entrylevel coder, so Im sure theres something Im missing but I havent been able to find the answer in the APIs. I thought maybe getTime returns default values, but then why the minutes are intactp  pThe point of this method is to update the mDisplayWorkCommute textview when its setText is called after receiving an extra, and thats where Im seeing that the text keeps getting a default hour 12, but still displaying the minute value that was set.

So, amidst the code that is working on stuff, I have some lines that read like sop  precodeform.changeStatusBox1 codepre  pWhich then point back to a method that looks like thisp  precode    public void changeStatusBoxint status              switch status                      case 0                 picBox.Image  project.Properties.Resources.gray                 break             case 1                 picBox.Image  project.Properties.Resources.green                 break             case 2                 picBox.Image  project.Properties.Resources.yellow                 break             case 3                 picBox.Image  project.Properties.Resources.red                 break               codepre  pNow, when I run the code, this doesnt update the picture box.

Negative 71051 pIm writing a web app in HTML5, jQuery and PHP. My application lets users modify HTML articles structure and source in a text area, so I have quite a lot of modal dialogs popping out to let the user do things on the article source.  Some of them just execute javascript for example to do search and replace, some others do an AJAX call to the server to get the list of images stored in a folder and let the user select one and insert the correct TAG in the underlying source. Another AJAX situation is to insert a link to another article by showing a list of existing articles, or assigning a custom property to the article, taken from a list of properties in a DB.p  pWhen the user needs an operation the main editing page calls a javascript function that asks the server via AJAX for an UI that contains a form and an Apply button. When the users clicks Apply a global javascript function is called modifying the article source according to the form data or to call another AJAX call to modify the DB via PHP.p  pAs the list of doable operations grows Im asking myself what is the strongbest practice to use modal dialogs in a web appstrong. p  pShould I write single functions for every doable operation in a huge javascript source always accessible this means a stronglong serie of requestUIForOperationX and applyOperationX couplesstrong p  pShould PHP send the javascript source in the AJAX response p  pIs there a generic good practice to manage a user click  modal dialog  resulting operation on the calling domp  pP.S I apologize for the twisted question  p

Negative 71051 pI am trying to build a Chrome extension that is fairly complex so Im just looking for a high level overview of how I should approach this. Keep in mind Im brand new to Chrome Extensions. p  pI need an extension that will analyze the source code of a page, and specifically monitor a number that is in a div on that page. Whenever that number gets over a certain threshold, I will need to take some sort of action popup, alert, etc. p  pThe source page is refreshed automatically every few seconds with updated info so I will need the extension to run every few seconds as well to capture the most updated data. p  pAs an overview, Im looking for suggestions on how to do the followingp  ol liRetrieve page source for a nonactive tab, every 5 seconds. It should run in the background and not need to be clicked to be functioning. li liLook into that source code to find what number is in a specific div. li liCreate some sort of alert or notification if that number exceeds a certain threshold. li ol  pI have seen various posts about how to get the source of an active page, but nothing about storing that source code to be analyzed. Also, Im not sure how I should go about looking within the source code I saw some JQuery recommendations. p  pOne last thought I was hoping this would be a relatively lightweight extension. Is running through this process every 51015 seconds going to be resource intensive p

Negative 71051 pI have a list of objects with each Item having a cost and a set of resources associated with it see below.

However the number of columns to check for the Cellsx, firstcolumn values could be changed, so values would need to be checked in any number of columns 2, 10 etc. My code works perfectly for the specified Ranges but if one is missing or more are added then it stops working.p  pThe columns to check against are always offset by 2 from the firstcolumn and firstcolumn is always B, it will be checked against D, F, H and so on while columns C,E,G etc have other data not relevant for this part. p  pMy best guess is to have the countif Ranges changed dynamically but Im at a loss of when and how this should be done...p  pCould anyone point me towards the right direction in order to achieve this I can post the full code if needed.p  pCheersp

Negative 71051 pMy app plays raw PCM audio data through various channels using ALSA.

But I cant figure out how to adapt it, and make it so, that each section of the onepager has its own template, and several columns to render, according to the pages backend layout. I guess, I could have all the sections on the one page template and have them rendered, referencing which columns should be rendered.

Negative 71051 pOne of my recent program highly depends on inlining a few hot functions for performance. These hot functions are part of an external code.ccode file which I would prefer not to change.p  pUnfortunately, while Visual is pretty good at this exercise, gcc and clang are not. Apparently, due to the fact that the hot functions are within a different code.ccode, they cant inline them.p  pThis leaves me with 2 options p  ul liEither include directly the relevant code into the target file.

Negative 71051 pI am testing the queue functions in Laravel 5.1. I can make jobs queue up in my db table, called jobs, and I can get them to run successfully. I also created a queue failure table called failedjobs. To test it, inside the jobs table I manipulate the payload data to make it fail then I run the queue worker daemon like so, so it will put the job in the failedjobs table after one failed attemptp  precodephp artisan queuework daemon tries1 queuemyqueue codepre  pWhen the job fails it is immediately put into failedjobs table as expected.p  pFYI I have set things up just like the Laravel 5.1 docs recommendp  pa hrefhttplaravel.comdocs5.1queuesdealingwithfailedjobs relnofollowhttplaravel.comdocs5.1queuesdealingwithfailedjobsap  pI have tried registering my queue failure event in the AppServiceProviders boot method as outlined in the docsp  precodeQueuefailingfunction connection, job, data              LogerrorJob failed          codepre  pI have also tried the failed method inside the actual job scripts like sop  precode           Handle a job failure.                     return void                   public function failed                      Logerrorfailed          codepre  pEither way, neither of these events is triggered when the queued job fails. I see nothing in the logs except for the exception stack trace which I made occur on purpose. Does Laravel 5.1 have a bug here or am I missing somethingp  pUPDATEp  pI have done some more research. When a queue job failure occurs, the logic for handling that failure is in vendorlaravelframeworksrcIlluminateQueueWorker.phpp  precodeprotected function logFailedJobconnection, Job job              if thisgtfailer              thisgtfailergtlogconnection, jobgtgetQueue, jobgtgetRawBody              jobgtdelete              jobgtfailed              thisgtraiseFailedJobEventconnection, job                   return [job gt job, failed gt true]      codepre  pWhat happens is the failed function never executes and it prevents the next function, raisedFailedJobEvent from being called. Its as if the script silently halts when failed is called. Now if I reverse the order of these lines, I can get the raiseFailedJobEvent to fire and if I register a queue event handler in EventServiceProvider.php or AppServiceProvider.php, I can verify it gets fired and I can successfully handle the event. Unfortunately, having failed before raiseFailedJobEvent prevents this event from ever occurring.p  pUPDATEp  pThe problem seems to stem from how I make it fail. If I deliberately corrupt the data in the job queue table, the failed method never gets called. There is a stack trace in the logsp  precodeStack trace 0 [internal function] IlluminateFoundationBootstrapHandleExceptionsgthandleError8, unserialize codepre  pIf I actually go into vendorlaravelframeworksrcIlluminateQueueWorker.php and force it to fail every time it runs in an exceptionless way of course, then failure gets called. The problem, obviously, is how do I know how this queue will behave in a realworld failure If corrupt db data causes a failure yet prevents failure from being called, this is no good. What if there is an actual corruption of db queue data in the real world p

Negative 71051 pIm using Java 8u51. This is really odd. I update ListCells through the Observer pattern, doing the followingp  precodeOverride public void updateObservable o, Object arg     cell.startEdit    PojoSample entry  PojoSample o    setNameentry.getName    cell.commitEditthis  codepre  pWhile troubleshooting the issue, I commented out the Observer update, and used a for loop to iterate over the ListView items btw, the items hold a reference to their ListCell, for convenience, doing the same thing above, which is to set the cell to editing, and commit the edit afterwards.p  pOn both methods, the 1st item never gets updated, while the rest of the list has no problem updating, regardless of size. I can confirm it received the values properly, and that the cell actually holds the correct data its just not displaying like it should.p  pThe only time I can change the 1st item, is to manually edit it. I edit a cell by using a custom TextField that becomes the ListCells graphic, when the overridden startEdit method is called.p  pHas anyone come across this Do you think this is a bugp

Negative 71051 pOK. I Have been lately working on an indoor geolocation application using a hrefhttpaltbeacon.github.ioandroidbeaconlibrary relnofollowAltBeacona library.

Negative 71051 pI have a fairly complex algorithm that performs a search where I use a codesearchcode variable in some range [0.25 to 1.75].p  pBased on the algorithm there is an interesting thing happens when the codesearchcode is exactly 1, because it hits a configuration of variables that is emsometimesem but not always most favorable.  Some of the code depends on codesearchcode being exactly 1 to produce that most favorable outcome.  p  pMore specifically, there is usually some specific value within the search range, which produces most favorable outcome, but the way my algorithm is laid out, that specific value is most often skipped over.  Here I lay out example when that specific value based on other inputs and configuration, happens to be exactly 1..p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pMathematically speaking if codesearchcode was continuous rather than discreet, I wouldnt have this problem.  My problem is trying to converge on most favorable variable configuration using discrete mathematics.  The issue here is the algorithm.

Negative 71051 pI have the following scenario that I am trying without success to handle. We have a set of Camel routes that I wish to send messages to a central error queue  an SQS queue  when certain error conditions arise so that we can more intelligently handle those conditions. [Currently failed messages are just logged and dropped]p  pIn order to keep the coupling between the existing bundles and the soontobecreated Error Bundle as loose as possible, I want to send the body of the failed message to the Queue, along with some metadata about the error scenario, without having to tie some arbitrary Error object to every OSGI bundle that might send to the error queue. In doing research on the correct way to do this, I discovered the MessageAttributes header and this is where the problem comes in I have so far been unable to correctly set this in the Camel Blueprint XML so that when I view the messages in the error queue via the AWS Management Console, I also see the attributes.p  pThe relevant part of the Blueprint XMLp  precodeltroute idlogAndSendToErrorQueuegt         ltdescriptiongt             This route is the exit point for messages which cannot be processed and should not be retried.

It seems like one of the commands is waiting for a response but does not seems to get one and does not result in an error.p  precodeurlscrapeltfunctionurllist   libraryrvest librarydplyr assetsltNA priceltNA descriptionltNA cityltNA lengthurllistgtn pb lt txtProgressBarmin  0, max  n, style  3   for i in 1n  scraping for price try readhtmlurllist[i] gt htmlnode.price span gt htmltextgtprice[i], silentTRUE  scraping for city try readhtmlurllist[i] gt htmlnode.city gt htmltextgtcity[i], silentTRUE  scraping for description try readhtmlurllist[i] gt htmlnodesh1 gt htmltext gt pastecollapse  gtdescription[i], silentTRUE  scraping for assets try readhtmlurllist[i] gt htmlnodes.assetsgtli gt htmltext gt pastecollapse  gtassets[i], silentTRUE  Sys.sleep2 setTxtProgressBarpb, i    Sys.timegttime print pasteFinished at,time gt print print returnas.data.framecbindprice,city,description,assets   codepre  p1 Without knowing the exact problem I looked for a timeout option in the rvest package with no avail.
