Positive 5996 pIm building a webapp that is a personal project for some months now. The project revolves a bit around the idea that people can save pictures and share them. Thus I need a high storage space for my pictures. Im totally clueless when it comes down to webhosting, I never hosted a website etc. At the moment the project is running on localhost and the images are saved on my computer. However I checked a bit some dedicated servers options and I saw the internal storage space was kind of limited 2TB or so. I also see that when uploading an image here on stackoverflow there is a little message  powered by imgur . So Im wondering what are my options here  Should  Can I make an account on imgur and save in there an infinite amount of images  Or are there other options like  excuse my ignorance the cloud or special servers to save images  Reddit for instance seems to save their file on a personal server, links of images on reddit look like this  a hrefhttpsb.thumbs.redditmedia.comimg.jpg relnofollowhttpsb.thumbs.redditmedia.comimg.jpgap

Positive 5996 pI am attempting to access a web application I have developed inside my Parallels VM.  I think I have followed most things correctly however missing that last step I think.  I am running IIS7 and from OS X get the default blue IIS page when I hit a hrefhttp10.211.55.3 relnofollowhttp10.211.55.3a and also a hrefhttp10.211.55.380 relnofollowhttp10.211.55.380a.    I get the same message when I hit a hrefhttplocalhost80 relnofollowhttplocalhost80a from within the VM. p  pWhen hitting those in Postman running on mac I get the message 405  HTTP verb used to access this page is not allowed. but at least I get that blue page from IIS visible in the host so I figure that is something i.e. the network type setting as shared in the Configuration is correct.  p  pAlso, Anonymous Authentication is Enabled in IIS for the site, and the firewall on the VM is off.p  pSo I assume port 80 is getting through, however when I test another urlport no luck i.e. when I a hrefhttplocalhost81apimenuitem relnofollowhttplocalhost81apimenuitema from within the VM, this time I get a 200 JSON response from my app as expected.  However when I hit the equivalent URL on the OS X host a hrefhttp10.211.55.381apimenuitem relnofollowhttp10.211.55.381apimenuitema I get Safari cant open the page because safari cant connect to the server 10.211.55.3.p  pI have also gone into Parallels Desktop PreferencesAdvancedChangeSettings... and tried adding a Port Forwarding Rule for the IP address setting both source amp destination ports to 81 but get the same result.  p  pSo I think it is my VM setup or IIS. IS there a good resource for setting up IIS on a VM for external access in a development environment such as this maybep  pEDIT With a little trial and error I now find I get the same No response result when hitting a hrefhttp10.211.55.381apimenuitem relnofollowhttp10.211.55.381apimenuitema from within the VM, however the localhost equivalent a hrefhttplocalhost81apimenuitem relnofollowhttplocalhost81apimenuitema works fine.  So the question comes down to how to setup IIS so the IP address works the same as localhost within the same development machine.p  pkind regards, Paul.p
Positive 5996 pI have been trying to work on my rails project since I precompiled the assets to deploy to Heroku. The css would not update, so I followed the advice of other similar entries and deleted the static file. The app would then never load, it would just be in a state of buffer. I have also tried to simply set the config.servestaticfiles to false. After running a rake assets clean, I have the same result. I have also tried dscacheutil flushcache, to not effect. p  pmy development.rb filep  precode    Rails.application.configure do        Settings specified here will take precedence over those in configapplication.rb.         In the development environment your applications code is reloaded on        every request. This slows down response time but is perfect for development        since you dont have to restart the web server when you make code changes.       config.cacheclasses  false         Do not eager load code on boot.       config.eagerload  false         Show full error reports and disable caching.       config.considerallrequestslocal        true       config.actioncontroller.performcaching  false         Dont care if the mailer cant send.       config.actionmailer.raisedeliveryerrors  false         Print deprecation notices to the Rails logger.       config.activesupport.deprecation  log         Raise an error on page load if there are pending migrations.       config.activerecord.migrationerror  pageload         Debug mode disables concatenation and preprocessing of assets.        This option may cause significant delays in view rendering with a large        number of complex assets.       config.assets.debug  false       config.servestaticfiles  false         Asset digests allow you to set farfuture HTTP expiration dates on all assets,        yet still be able to expire them through the digest params.       config.assets.digest  true       config.assets.compress  true        Adds additional error checking when serving assets at runtime.        Checks for improperly declared sprockets dependencies.        Raises helpful error messages.       config.assets.raiseruntimeerrors  false         Raises error for missing translations        config.actionview.raiseonmissingtranslations  true     end codepre  pAnd just in case my production.rb filep  precode    Rails.application.configure do        Settings specified here will take precedence over those in configapplication.rb.         Code is not reloaded between requests.       config.cacheclasses  true         Eager load code on boot. This eager loads most of Rails and        your application in memory, allowing both threaded web servers        and those relying on copy on write to perform better.        Rake tasks automatically ignore this option for performance.       config.eagerload  true         Full error reports are disabled and caching is turned on.       config.considerallrequestslocal        false       config.actioncontroller.performcaching  true         Enable RackCache to put a simple HTTP cache in front of your application        Add rackcache to your Gemfile before enabling this.        For largescale production use, consider using a caching reverse proxy like        NGINX, varnish or squid.        config.actiondispatch.rackcache  true         Disable serving static files from the public folder by default since        Apache or NGINX already handles this.       config.servestaticfiles  ENV[RAILSSERVESTATICFILES].present         Compress JavaScripts and CSS.       config.assets.jscompressor  uglifier        config.assets.csscompressor  sass         Do not fallback to assets pipeline if a precompiled asset is missed.       config.assets.compile  false         Asset digests allow you to set farfuture HTTP expiration dates on all assets,        yet still be able to expire them through the digest params.       config.assets.digest  true         config.assets.precompile and config.assets.version have moved to configinitializersassets.rb         Specifies the header that your server uses for sending files.        config.actiondispatch.xsendfileheader  XSendfile  for Apache        config.actiondispatch.xsendfileheader  XAccelRedirect  for NGINX         Force all access to the app over SSL, use StrictTransportSecurity, and use secure cookies.        config.forcessl  true         Use the lowest log level to ensure availability of diagnostic information        when problems arise.       config.loglevel  debug         Prepend all log lines with the following tags.        config.logtags  [ subdomain, uuid ]         Use a different logger for distributed setups.        config.logger  ActiveSupportTaggedLogging.newSyslogLogger.new         Use a different cache store in production.        config.cachestore  memcachestore         Enable serving of images, stylesheets, and JavaScripts from an asset server.        config.actioncontroller.assethost  httpassets.example.com         Ignore bad email addresses and do not raise email delivery errors.

Obtaining buyin is not a problem, it is my company and the developers are more than happy to work like this.p  pThe problem is that 75 of our revenue is derived from fixed lengthfixed price projects. p  pKen Schwaber in his book, Agile Project Management with Scrum, covers the topic of bidding on fixed lengthfixed price projects in an appendix at the end of the book.p  pAfter much soul searching, Ken derived that Scrum is only useful in this situation when you can convince the potential client to think differently. The client would have to be okay with  a lot of uncertainty about the final cost and the final delivery date in return for getting something much sooner that may be usuable and the possibility of not having to implement every feature could save them money.p  pIm not convinced that this is the only way to implement Scrum in fix lengthfix price projects.p  pI want to know how others have successfully bid on and profitted from fix lengthfix price projects.p

Negative 5996 pLets say I have a class which, internally, stores a List of datap  precodeimport java.util.List  public class Wrapper      private ListltIntegergt list      public WrapperListltIntegergt list          this.list  list           public Integer getint index  return list.getindex   codepre  pFor the sake of this example, pretend its a useful and necessary abstraction.  Now, heres my concern As a programmer who knows the underlying implementation of this class, should I be specific about which type of List I ask for in the constructor  To demonstrate, Ive made this testp  precodeimport java.util.List import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.LinkedList  public class Main      public static void mainString[] args          long start     ListltIntegergt list1  new ArrayListltIntegergt     ListltIntegergt list2  new LinkedListltIntegergt     Wrapper wrapper1, wrapper2      forint i  0 i lt 1000000 i          list1.addi     list2.addi           wrapper1  new Wrapperlist1     wrapper2  new Wrapperlist2      start  System.currentTimeMillis      wrapper1.get500000      System.out.printlnSystem.currentTimeMillis  start      start  System.currentTimeMillis      wrapper2.get500000      System.out.printlnSystem.currentTimeMillis  start       codepre  pAs you most likely know, randomly accessing an element takes a bit more time with a linked list as opposed to an array.  So, going back to the Wrapper constructor, should I be general and allow for any type of List, or should I specify that the user pass an ArrayList to ensure the best possible performance  While in this example, it may be easy for the user to guess as to what the underlying implementation of the method emgetem is, you could imagine that this was something more complex.

Negative 5996 pA SQL VIEW is a global, logical table that may or may not be persisted. But its still a table. Therefore, should a VIEW always adhere to first normal form 1NF i.e. no duplicate rows, scalar types only, no toptobottom or lefttoright ordering, etc. What about the higher normal formsp  pFor me, my applications consume the results of stored procs, my VIEWs are consumed by SQL queries, and these two usages are mutually exclusive i.e. I dont query the resultsets of stored procs using SQL and my applications do not contain SQL code.

Negative 5996 pIm elaborating over a problem which seems hard to me and Im not expecting a simple solution, but maybe there are proven practices or further reading that might make this easier. Im pretty sure that the general problem pops up in many applications for example garbage collection or transactional databases.p  pMy application has a graph a DAG if it matters which is being traversed by multiple threads simultaneously. Some of these are just trying to find certain nodes or retrieve a subgraph, others may change the graphs structure.p  pThe policy I want to implement is that a reading thread will perform its entire operation on a snapshot of the graph, i. e. see the structure as it was at a certain point in time.p  pMy current plan is to set up something similar to row versioning in transactional DBs, i. e. a reading thread first obtains a current version number and then only visits graph nodes and edges that have this version number or earlier. Writing threads would then put an incremented version number on new elements changed elements would be cloned first, making them invisible for running readers. A writing thread can then commit its new version when it has successfully finished, and readers would release their version number, making deleted elements eligible for removal.p  pThis strategy is still sketchy and has a number of unsolved issues such as concurrent write access, but generally it seems like a viable road to go.p

Negative 5996 pDue to severe limitations of the Microsoft Windows Installer MSI system it is required to create a bootstrapper in order to install multiple MSI files due to prepostrequisites. However, this introduces an distribution problem because you now have multiple files that need to be included with the distribution. There are of course multiple ways to distribute this as a single file.p  h11 An archiveh1  pYou can put all the files into a single archive that users download. The obvious choice for MS Windows is of course a PKZIP archive. But this is not very user friendly. Users will first have to extract the archive, and then run the bootstrapper which would be called setup.exe.p  h12 A SFX archiveh1  pInstead of distributing an plain archive file you could wrap it into a self extracting archive. Executing this SFX archive would prompt the user to extract andor run the contents. But this adds yet another prompt to the whole installation process 1 SFX prompt, 2 bootstrapper prompt, 3 main installer prompt. This is also not very user friendly, as it increase annoyance due to multiple prompts.p  h13 Single file bootstrapperh1  pOf course there is the option to embed all the extract files into the bootstrapper. This is probably the most user friendly for a normal enduser. However, this is less friendly for system administrators, because usually bootstrappers are less manageable than the MSI files. An admin would rig the system so that all requisites are also installed when the main MSI is installed, thus the bootstrapper would not be needed.p  h14 Otherh1  pAn other unlisted methodp  pSo what do you think is the best way to distribute a installer for MS Windows software that requires a bootstrapperp

Negative 5996 pIm building a video player using Flash CS4 hereby referred to as Flash to create the graphic symbols and compiling and debugging with Flash Builder 4 FB4. Here are the steps I take in my current workflowp  pCreate the graphic symbols in Flash. Ive created a few different symbols for the player, but Ill focus on just the playpause button ppbutton here.p  pIn the Library panel, I go to the ppbutton symbols Linkage properties and link to a class named assets.PlayPauseButtonAsset that extends MovieClip. I do not actually have an assets package nor do I have a class file for PlayPauseButtonAsset as Flash will create them for me when I publish.p  pIn Flashs Publish settings, I set the project to export a SWC that will be used in FB4, called VideoPlayerAssets.swc.p  pAfter the SWC is created, I create my FB4 project called VideoPlayer and add the SWC to my path. FB4 creates the class VideoPlayer in the default package automatically.p  pIn VideoPlayer.as, I import assets., which imports all of the symbol classes I created in Flash and are available via VideoPlayerAssets.swc. I can now instantiate the ppbutton and add to the stage, like this p  precodevar ppbuttonPlayPauseButtonAsset  new PlayPauseButtonAsset addChildppbutton codepre  pAt this point ppbutton doesnt have any functionality because I didnt create any code for it. So I create a new class called video.controls.PlayPauseButtonLogic which extends assets.PlayPauseButtonAsset. I add some logic, and now I can use that new class to put a working ppbutton on the stagep  precodevar ppbuttonPlayPauseButtonLogic  new PlayPauseButtonLogic addChildppbutton codepre  pThis works fine, but you may be asking why I didnt just link the ppbutton symbol in Flash to the video.controls.PlayPauseButtonLogic class in the first place. The reason is that I have a designer creating the UI in Flash and I dont want to have to republish the SWC from Flash every time I make a change in the logic. Basically, I want my designer to be able to make a symbol in Flash, link that symbol to a logically named class in Linkage properties, and export the SWC. I do not want to have to touch that .fla file again unless the designer makes changes to the symbols or layout. Im using a versioning system for the project as well and its cleaner to make sure only the designer is touching the .fla file.p  pSo, finally, heres the issue Im running intop  pAs the design gets more complex, the designer is nesting symbols to position the video controls on the control bar. He creates a controlbar symbol and links it to assets.ControlBarAsset. The controlbar symbol contains the ppbutton symbol.p  pThe designer publishes the SWC and ControlBarAsset is now available in FB4. I create new class called video.controls.ControlBarLogic that extends assets.ControlBarAsset so I can add some logic to the controlbar, and I add the controlbar to the stagep  precodevar controlbarControlBarLogic  new ControlBarLogic addChildcontrolbar codepre  pThis works, but the ppbutton doesnt do anything. Thats because ppbutton, while inside controlbar, is still only linked to PlayPauseButtonAsset, which doesnt have any logic. Im no longer instantiating a ppbutton object because its part of controlbar.p  pThats where Im stuck today. I cant seem to simply recast controlbars ppbutton as PlayPauseButtonLogic as I get a Type error. And I dont want to have to make a class that has to instantiate each of the video player controls, the place them at their x and y values on the stage according to how the designer placed them, as that would require me to open the .fla and check the various properties of a symbol, then add those values to the code. If the designer made a change, Id have to go into the code each time just to update those properties each time. Not good.p  pHow do I recast nested symbols to use the logic classes that I create that extend the asset classes Remember, the solution is not to link Flash symbols to actual classes so I dont have to keep recompiling the SWC, unless theres a way to do that without having to recompile the SWC. I want the designer to do his thing, publish the SWC, and be done with it. Then I can take his SWC, apply my logic to his assets, and be able to debug and compile the final SWF.p

So far created an application that downloads RSS feeds and emails them in html format. The emails are filtered for content I am interested in by a server application written in Python. Next stage is a DSL language to communicate with a server, bit like telnet over email. Should be fun. After that RPC over Email between multi applications.p

Negative 5996 pI am trying to figure out how to implement the following scenario. I have multiple project sites with the same structure the structure contains subsites and libraries. I want to tag each document with a projectnumber eg 100050BCD. How can i set this as default for each subsite in the site collection, so the user does not have to fill in the number over and over again. p  pMy first approach was to create a contenttype contract on site collection level which contains the site columns Title, Description, Projectnumber etc  but i cannot set a value for each subsite. Right So i think this could not work.p  pwith the second approach i would use managed metadata. I would create a column on the subsite level called projectnumber with a default value from the managed metadata store. So in the metadata store I create the projectnumbers and set this as default in the subsite column type. This column is added in the libraries in the subsite. I then should be able to use the metadata as refinement in my searchresults, or not The ugly part in it is that i have different column types projectnumber for each subsite, that feels not quite right.p  pThe question is am i using the right approach or should i use another one and could this be done much easier p

Negative 5996 pConsider this short SmallC programp  precodeinclude lib main      int bob  codepre  pMy ANTLR grammar picks it up fine if I specify, in ANTLWorks and when using the Interpreter, line endings  Mac CR. If I set the line endings option to Unix LF, the grammar throws a NoViableAltException and does not recognize anything after the end of the include statement. This error disappears if I add a newline at the end of include. The computer Im using for this is a Mac, so I figured that it made sense to have to set the line endings to Mac format. So instead, I switch to a Linux box  and get the same thing. If I type anything in the ANTLRWorks Interpreter box, and if I dont select line endings Mac CR, I get issues about insufficient blank lines as was the case above and, in addition, the last statement of each statement block requires an extra space following the semicolon ie. after bob above.p  pThese bugs show up again when I run a Java version of my grammar on a code input file that I want to parse...p  pWhat could possibly be the issue Id understand if the issue was the presence of TOO many new lines, in a format that perhaps the parser didnt understand  werent caught by my whitespace rule.

Negative 5996 pIm creating a new middle tier where all of our client calls will go through a WCF service.  Were using ASP.NET membership with the service in order to authenticate users.  The middle tier will be hitting an existing database in which we already have an InetUsers table containing usernames and passwords.p  pThis is where it starts to get messy.  This new middle tier will be used by our web application, but not by our existing desktop application, which will  until we rewrite it at some point in the future  be using the old COM middle tier.  Administration of the users for the web application takes place in the desktop application.  In other words, users will be created and passwords set and changed from within the desktop application, which in turn hits the already existing InetUsers table.p  pIdeally, what will happen is when we deploy the new middle tier, well take all of the users from the InetUsers table and create records for them in aspnetUsers and aspnetMembership.  Then well set a trigger on the InetUsers table to keep aspnetUsers and aspnetMembership uptodate.p  pTheres a whole bunch of questions wrapped up in this, so Ill try and list them all out herep  ul liIs this the right approach  Obviously having this data in two places isnt ideal, but bear in mind here that Im not the final decision maker here and were kinda stuck with some legacy stuff here, at least for now.  Still  maybe theres a better way. liIn the same vein  would we be better off coding our own membership provider rather than using the SqlMembershipProvider  How difficulteasy is it to do so liIf we use this approach, I plan on using the aspnetMembershipXXXX stored procedures for the initial population of the tables as well as in the triggers.  Having done some research into this, it appears that if I want to call aspnetMembershipCreateUser directly from SQL ie in a trigger... rather than using the API, I have to store clear text passwords since I cant get the salt and the hash right otherwise.  Is this true liDoes any of this even make sense or am I going about this the wrong way to begin with ul  pMuch appreciation for any help offered.p
Negative 5996 pIm starting to deal with gps data on Android 2.1 HTC Hero and look around on topics about Kalman filter and least squares fit to location data. While receiving and logging GPS data using phone Ive found small dispersion if staying on position, but coordinates are pretty accurate when moving. Here comes the question  Do getLatitude and getLongitude functions provide raw coordinates, or data was prefiltered by android while position is fixed or during movementp  pIm curious if anyone tested Kalman on android and its possible to say that you have certain improvements with gps. In my case I read GPS data every 3 secondswas done to send it over mobile network to server along with compass data and accelerometer. Therefore, I can make filtering on device or on the server. If to do it on device reading can be done more often, but on server I could use additional calculation power.p

Negative 5996 pIve just finished the Rails3Tutorial book and Im trying my first real world rails dev. Feels like driving alone for the first time just after passing the test  scary.p  pAnyhoo, heres my problem. Id like to list the contents of a directory on a web page. Simple enough, but I have a few questions. Im using RSpec by the wayp  pFirstly, how do I test drive the solution I need to mock the filesystem so I can dictate the results of Dir.entries or similar for the test case. I know I could write the contents of the directory in the beforeeach block and then clean up after the test but that feels clumsy. I know how to create a stub for the Dir objects and how to force the results, but how do I get that stubbed object into the controller. I want to use the mocked object during testing and the real thing for production. How do I do thatp  pSecondly, where should I put the code that inspects the file system. Im not really using a database for this since Im building info by looking at the directory. So should there be a model at all Or should I do the heavy lifting in the controllerp  pIm sure Im staring the solution in the face, but any help you can give will help me make my first tentative steps into Rails loveliness. So thanks in advance.p

Negative 5996 pFrameworks such as PRISM and MEF make it very easy to design complex applications out of multiple, composable components. One common example of this is a plugin architecture where an application shell can be dymanically reconfigured with plugin UI components eg by dropping DLLs into a codePluginscode directory.p  pThis is all well and good, but as Vaccano spotted in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4011722canprismbemodularwhencallingwebservicesCan Prism be modular when calling webservicesa there are circumstances where each individual plugin requires its own set of configuration  WCF bindings being a typical example, but there are many other scenarios logging, database connections, etc. with similar needs.p  pSo, as I see it, the options we have arep  ul liAll config goes into the codeApp.configcode of the shell application which as Vaccano mentioned breaks the whole encapsulation amp deployment advantages of this model, or li liEach plugin assembly uses a bespoke mechanism for config eg an embedded resource and then uses this to dynamically configure a WCF service, for example which at best is messy and time consuming, and at worst may not be possibleli ul  pNeither of these options are ideal, but they are workarounds. However, the ideal situation would be for each plugin DLL to have either self contained config such as an embedded resource file or an codeXxx.dll.configcode file, and have each of these XML config fragments merged into the codeApp.configcode configuration of the shell application dynamically at runtime. This is reminiscent of the way codeMachine.configcode and codeApp.configcode files are merged.p  pMy question, therefore, is has anyone come across any existing frameworks or techniques which could be used to allow this dynamic merging of composite config files into the inprocess configuration of the container application emI am surprised not to see this as part of PRISM or MEF and therefore slightly wary of posting this question in case I have missed something obvious  if so, please just quietly post the relevant link emp

The font list that is displayed in the Properties panel is much smaller than my total list of installed fonts and it looks like its leaving out all Open Type fonts.p  pAny thoughts on how to get fonts working again in Flash CS5 Professional Thanksp

But 9 out of 10 times i am not getting the examplecodes entirely because of that 1 little thing of which i dont even know what its called. How do you even know if there is a command for the function you want to express and more importantly.... how its called and where it located in what namespacep  pEven the best videoexamples arent doing it for me, because when any code is typed, they never explain how the code exactly works. And most of the times it just doesnt even add up to what i know of logic code of course im wrong.p  pIn the early days i learned the Commodore64s Basic no problem. Learning and writing Actionscript Flash, within 2 months creating a 2Dshootem up Learning and writing CMD, within 3 months writing 5000 lines of code for all sorts of functions.p  pWhy in Merlins beard is WPF so hard Watching the simplest tutorialvideos are becoming more and more demotivational.p  pAnyone recognizes thisp  pThanks for reading, Dannyp

Negative 5996 pIm coding a library ObjC for iPhone that I want to package and sell, so I obviously need to work out any design kinks before listing it for sale. I am also utilizing this library to help me develop another app.  p  pMy library is heavily built on task delegation. The primary function I have is to launch a potentially longrunning process, and when its done, I call a Delegate Protocol method in the classs delegate.  p  pAn additional complicating factor here is that I will often schedule this task to fire off every 30 seconds or so. Usually, I do this with [self performSelectorselectorsomeMethod withObjectnil afterDelay30] rather than using an NSTimer. Then, when the delegate method successfully returns, I process the returned data and trigger the method to fire in another 30 seconds. This gives me 30 seconds BETWEEN method calls, rather than 30 seconds FROM THE START OF ONE CALL TO THE NEXT. This is mainly just in case the call ever takes more than 30 seconds, which shouldnt happen.    p  pThe error that Im catching is that sometimes, the Delegate callback method is failing with an EXCBADACCESS error. Based upon my investigation, it appears that the delegate of my class library has disappeared been releaseddealloced since the longrunning process was initiated. Thus, when it calls [[self Delegate] doSomeDelegateMethod], its accessing a released object.p  pI tried first checking [[self Delegate] respondsToSelectorselectordoSomeDelegateMethod], but even that access apparently also throws the EXCBADACCESS.p  pIt doesnt yet seem that checking for [self Delegate]  nil is the right way to go, either.p  pOne way I think I have solved the problem, in this specific instance, is when the view controller that instantiates my object is disappearing and therefore on its way to the garbage dump, I call [NSObject cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTargetself]. This apparently fixes the problem. Does this fix also indicate that my object knows about the call to come and keeps itself in memory until it can successfully, desperately, fire off its final shotp  pThis appears to put a bandaid on a bullet wound. Yes, it appears to stop my app from breaking this time, but my gut tells me that this is a poor solution.p  pIve also considered setting the custom object to nil in my viewWillDisappearanimated method, which is probably the correct coding pattern, but it doesnt seem right that the customer has to be so precise in handling my objects. p  pWhats really bugging me, though, is that I havent yet found a way, as a library developer, to box in my code so that it wont throw an exception for the user if they dont do just the right things. Basically, Id like a way to have my objectp  ol liGet a request.li liGo look for the answer.li liFind the answer.li liTry to return the answer.li liRealize that theres nothing on the other end.li liGive up and die on its own.

In another view controller, where I am using this library, I implemented the NSTimer strategy. If the view is popped from the navigation stack i.e., in the viewWillDisappearanimated method, I invalidate said timer. So, no more calls will go to my library after the view disappears.p  pHeres the rub what if the view disappears emIN THE MIDDLEem of the longrunning call Yes, its tricky and unlikely to do, but I just had it happen on the simulator. In particular, strongTHISstrong is why Im looking for a workaround to let my code realize hey, theres nothing on the other end of this pipe and then fail gracefully. Anyonep  pThanksp

Negative 5996 pA question regarding Rails associations. br  Consider the following modelsbr p  ul listrongPeoplestrongbr li listrongEventsstrongbr li listrongImagesstrongli ul  pPeople and events can have many images.br Images uploaded to an event, need to have the ability to be associated with multiple people. p  pThis means that there are two relationships between empeopleem and emimagesem.br  One where images are uploaded directly on the person. And one where a person is tagged in an event.p  pCan there also be a relationship between a empersonem and an emeventem based on the fact they were tagged in one or multiple images in an event In this regard, its a sort of image tagging system where associations are created based on what event people are tagged in.p  pWondering what is the best practice in Rails to create this association Any help or advice is greatly appreciated  p

For example, the format bar in Pages, and the format bar in Mail when youre composing a message both right below the toolbar.p  pDoes anyone know how to achieve the correct look for these controlsp

They can be converted to Python, PHP, JS, etc skeletonsstubs. Other projects in different languages, each in its own repository, want to use those stubs. How to deliver the stubs to the projectsp  pI see only two waysp  ol lipGenerate the stub files and store them in the interfaces repository, and this repository should be attached to the projects ones as readonly submodule or any other way. But this way introduces a lot of headaches when checking out the updates to the interfaces and the stubs due to overcomplicated git submodules concepts.pli lipAttach pure interfaces repository to each project, and generate stub files as temporary gitignorable files with make stubs or alike. This way, each project can have their own generation settings with their own patches applied if needed at all. But you need to introduce some compilation commands to PHPPython development and production environments not just git pull.pli ol  pWhat are the pros and cons of these approachesp

Negative 5996 pI examined the possibilities of previewing and printing generic text in Java. The requirements which I depend on arep  ol liI should be able to specify font family and size of the font for both the preview component and for printed text.li liThe print preview must look exactly the same as the printed text.li liPrinting must be independend of printer device no printer specific commands to define fonts etc..li liPrinting of approx. 20 pages of generic text must start immediately without any significant delay caused by data processingli ol  pTo meet the aformentioned requirements I first tried the Java Print Service API. I created the JTextPane which contained the text to preview and print. By using JTextPane I was able to specify the font so the result looked fancy. To print data from JTextPane I used the standard procedure, which is independend from printer devicep  precodePrinterJob pj  PrinterJob.getPrinterJob  pj.setPrintablemyTextPane pj.print codepre  pEverything would be fine if printing 20 pages of plain text wouldnt start in 15 seconds after the print method was executed.p  pHowever printing starts immedialety when I print the same text as raw byte array applicationoctetstream with few PCL specific commands to set a proper font. But this approach is printer specific and there is also a problem with previewing the text so that the priview look exactly the same as printed text.p  pThe problem with JTextPane is most likely caused by the fact that the data sent to printer are too large pixelbypixel while the second solution is a matter of few bytes. Unfortunately none of these solutions are sufficion for me because they dont meet all of the requirements.p  pProbably the solution would be if there is some facade over printer control languages PCL, ESCP, ... which would allow me to set the text font independently from the printer device. The problem with print preview would not be solved, but at least the printing would start immediately.p  pAny advice how to print the plain text not breaking the aforemention 4 criteriap

Negative 5996 pI am building an application in Zend Framework. My model is made up of three layers, domain classes, data mapper classes and a service layer which provides an interface for all external communication.

I guess my question is what would be best practice to achieve this As far as the consumer is concerned the information is specific to the domain of the user so I think that it should be called from the User class. To achieve this the domain class would need to contain its own mapper instance but is that negating the point of having the service class in the first place I dont really want to be doing this everytime.p  precoderecipeCount  thisgtservicegtgetRecipeCountuser codepre  pAny thoughts will be appreciatedp

Negative 5996 pIm using an NSSlider control, and Ive configured it to use continuous mode so that I can continually update an NSTextField with the current value of the slider while the user is sliding it around. The issue I have is that I dont want to commit the value until the user lets go of the knob, i.e I dont want my application to take account of the value unless the user lets go of the slider to signify its at the desired value. At the moment, I have no way of knowing when thats the case the action method is just getting called continuously with no indication of when the slider has been released.p  pIf possible, I need a solution which will cover edge cases such as the user interacting the with slider with the keyboard or accessibility tools if there is such a thing. Id started to look into using mouse events, but it didnt seem like an optimum solution for the reasons Ive just outlined.p  pp

Negative 5996 pIm writing a CLI application in python with is used by means of a rather elaborate commandline language. The idea is very similar to find1 which arguably has the same property.p  pCurrently, the parser is completely handwritten using a handmade EBNF description language.

Negative 5996 pIve run into a problem when printing using MFC. The problem is Im told the printable area is 201x288mm, but I am actually finding it to be 200.9x287.9mm.p  pTo illustrate the issue, I created a blank TabbedDocument MFC application in Visual Studio 2008, using the wizard.

Next I draw the 201x288mm box, this prints without the right hand and bottom line, which are clipped.

The other bits remain unchanged.p blockquote  pSo what I expect from this function is when I have the following byte code00101101code and I use code01000000code for both xormasks and as the andmask, that only the second bit would be set to 1 and the result would be code01101101code.p  pHowever, when doing the math and going through the functions, the result is code00000000code.p  pWhat am I doing wrong or is there something about this function that I dont understand This kind of low level programming has been a while so I dont really know if this is a methodology used often and why and how you should use it.p  pstrongLet me just ask this simple questionstrong Is there a way to use this function effectively to set or unsetchange a single bit without asking specifically for the current valuep  pstrongFor examplestrong The current value is code00101101code I dont know this, but I just want to make sure the second bit is set, so the result must be code01101101code.p  pstrongImportant Infostrong In my documentation PDF, it seems there is a little space between XOR and the first xorMask1, so this may be where a codecode or codecode or some other negation sign might have been and it could very well be lost due to some weird encoding issues. So I will test the function if it does what the documentation says or what the function declaration says. Hold on to your helmets, will post back with the results drums please....p

Negative 5996 pI have a few table frequently used by my website. for example, largest one is a location table which is holding massive static data. So anytime users come over my website, they do search for within these locations. It holds around 1.5 million rows. I have sized this table using memory profiler and it is nearly 500mb in the memory. eventually I have a few more static tables those I need to access very quickly and they are static. at the end my memory dump gets up to 1,5 gb memory usage. which is not a problem for me while I have a powerful server with a lot of memory available. but when I raise that question, senior developers and architectures are telling me that I should review my project because a process shouldnt occupy that much memory. But I need quick access, I dont want to query my DB every time. I need response under 1 sec. Thats why memory looks like the way for me. Is there any better advise  p  pI am using asp.net and ms SQL 2008. at the moment Framework 4.0 but soon will be 4.5. IIS 7.5 on my webserver.p  pI appreciate for your help. thanks.p

The services use the same Unit of Work object that contains references to the repositories, so all service CRUD methods execute within the same EF context, which provides me goodies like transactions and concurrency.p  pIn my controller, Im making calls to multiple services within my Create action. Would it be preferable to instead make a single call to OrderService, which then makes a call to the InventoryService itselfp  pIs there a way to attach the Unit of Work object into the service via Unity, given I need the same UoA object for each service I couldnt think of a way to do it which wouldnt end up with a different instance for each service.p  pIf anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, I would love to hear themp  pThanksp  pChrisp

Negative 5996 pIm trying to create a procedural that draws cards from a deck at random. The problem was that I needed to make the draw procedure actually random, as each draw is the same when using srand and rand when no other factors change. Thus I attached it to timet seconds and was able to make the draw semi random. This is because I have to wait for a second to go by for the parameter of timet seconds to change. The reason this is a problem is that my program is made to draw again if it draws the same card twice which its known to do. Thus if it does draw the same card twice it will be forced to draw around fifteen more times or more or less until the timet second parameter changes. Is there a way to measure milliseconds or an otherwise smaller unit of time for time so I dont have this issue p  pHere is the code, though the checking for match and organizing proceedures are not attached those only occur after the initial draw anyway.p  precodeint allow  0     string cards[]       02hearts, 03hearts, 04hearts, 05hearts, 06hearts, 07hearts, 08hearts,09hearts, 10hearts, 11hearts, 12hearts, 13hearts, 14hearts,      02clubs, 03clubs, 04clubs, 05clubs, 06clubs, 07clubs, 08clubs, 09clubs, 10clubs, 11clubs, 12clubs,13clubs, 14clubs,14clubs,      02spades, 03spades, 04spades, 05spades, 06spades, 07spades, 08spades, 09spades, 10spades, 11spades, 12spades, 13spades, 14spades,     02diamonds, 03diamonds, 04diamonds, 05diamonds, 06diamonds, 07diamonds, 08diamonds, 09diamonds, 10diamonds, 11diamonds, 12diamonds, 13diamonds, 14diamonds     string cardHand [5]     string cardnumbers [5]     int cardInts [5]     string handSuites [5]     char handSuitesChar [5]          check deck     whileallow  0           set clock     timet seconds      timeampseconds       srandunsigned int seconds      int type      initiate counters     int n  0     int n1  0     int n2  0     int n3  0     int n4  0      draw cards     whilen lt 5              type  rand  52         cardHand[n]  cards[type]         cout ltlt cardHand[n] ltlt ,          n            cout ltlt endl      pull numbers from cards     whilen1 lt 5              string character2         cardnumbers[n1]  cardHand[n1].at0         character2  cardHand[n1].at1         cardnumbers[n1].appendcharacter2         cout ltlt cardnumbers[n1] ltlt ,          n1          cout ltlt endl     cout ltlt endl       convert numbers to ints     whilen2 lt 5              stringstream convertcardnumbers[n2]          if convert gtgt cardInts[n2]             cardInts[n2]  0          cout ltlt cardInts[n2]  100 ltlt ,           n2           cout ltlt endl      pull out first letters for suites     while n3 lt 5              handSuites[n3]  cardHand[n3].at2          cout ltlt handSuites[n3]ltlt endl         n3            convert letters to chars     while n4 lt 5              stringstream converthandSuites[n4]          if convert gtgt handSuitesChar[n4]             handSuitesChar[n4]  0          cout ltlt handSuitesChar[n4]  100 ltlt ,          n4      codepre

Negative 5996 pThe issue is fairly simple, I have some constants in a C namespace that I would like to wrap using SWIG 2.0.8.  It looks something like thisp  precodenamespace Example      static const float PI  3.14159f     ...      Lots of classes are here   codepre  pUnfortunately SWIG handles this rather awkwardly.  In the C case, it adds the constants to a class with the same name as the namespace so it must be accessed by using codeExample.Example.PIcode even when I am explicitly codeusing Examplecode due to masking by the module name.p  pIn Java, its even worse as it does not treat it as a constant at all and I am forced to call it using codeExample.getPIcode as a method call instead of a constant class variable.p  pIf I move the constants to the global namespace, this seems to work but then the variables must be accessed using codeExampleConstants.PIcode.p  pIdeally, I would like both languages to be able to access the constants via codeExample.PIcode to be consistent with C.  But a compromise that I would be happy with is if I could have a codeConstantscode class inside my namespace so that I can use codeConstants.PIcode in either language.  But of course, C does not allow nonintegral types to be defined inside a class and this is still not solving the issue in Java.p  pIs there any elegant way to handle these namespace constants with SWIG And if not, is there a way I can manually add a Java or C class to define themp

Can I use replication mechanism together with terracotta to solve this problem, as by using replication on 1 cache I will get that element on other server and for all other caches I can use terracotta.

Negative 5996 pI have a situation where I want to store messages that cant be delivered to the JMS server when the client becomes disconnected from the JMS server.

What are the most light weight implementations available  HornetMQ, ActiveMQ  Seems like this is a very niche use case and there could be an optimized implementation for this scenario that wraps another provider and is lighter weight than a full embedded JMS provider.p

Ive tried using a different color format for the still, unsetting preview callback before taking a picture, adding a second buffer, requeueing the second buffer, setting surface holder to push type, and some other things that I am failing to recall at the moment.

Negative 5996 pThe question is maybe a little strange. But I am looking for a way that updates on a table are only allowed when the user gives a comment. The comments should be saved in a second audittable when updating the normal table.br I think there is no way in oracle how the user can give a comment when executing update table set.... br br So i create my own procedure, where a user can pass the statement and the comment as parameters. Updates without this procedure are prevented by a trigger.p  precodecreate or replace     PROCEDURE UpdateTablestmt varchar2, comment varchar2 AS      BEGIN         Insert into audittable valuesstmt, comment         Execute immediate stmt END UpdateTable codepre  pI am not really happy with this solution.

Negative 5996 pFor several years, Ive been building and maintaining a social media app which will go unnamed for certain reasons.  The app was originally built on top of a PHP social networking app called Social Engine.  At the beginning of the project, social engine suited the app well, but over the years Ive had to customize it so much that its more my code than social engine.  Furthermore, dealing with conflicting libraries, deprecations and other maintenance issues has lead me to decide this thing needs to be rebuilt from scratch, properly. This thing has become a bit of a FrakenAppp  pIve built custom social networking sites on top os Social Engine, Wordpress, Drupal, and others.  Although  these products offer great features that can really speed up development, I find that they are designed to be SO flexible, that the code base has a lot of overhead that I could do with out. Wordpresss Taxonomy system is a perfect example.p  pAt the same time, I dont want to rebuild my app from scratch, and wind up reinventing the wheel with things like user objects, signups, photo uploads, and other things that the above mentioned CMS offer out of the box.  Its just not a good use of my time, and Id rather be focusing on developing the unique aspects of my app. Also, when it comes to the database, I rather be designing schemas that are tailored to the classes and objects of my app than trying to coax existing schemas to work for my purposes.p  pOn to my actual question  Are there any PHP frameworks or SDKs that are more stripped down, and less featured than Social Engine, Wordpress, Drupal, etc, yet offer some of the above mentioned functionality  The ideal solution for me would be something that comes with an extensible user class, helper classes for handling file uploads, image resizing, etc., some basic DB schemas, and no frontend. A modern and secure database class would also be nice. Im a big fan of the WP DB classp  pThanks in advance for your brilliant suggestionsp

Negative 5996 pI have some code that is reading in a csv file. The code then adds values in based on user input. The problem that I am having is removing entries that contain an invalid value.

Negative 5996 pWe have swf files that play on our clients screens constantly for days to months without ever being restarted. most of them work fine, however after a seemingly random amount of time, usually between days and weeks, parts, or all of the flash movie will freeze.p  pThe file loads in a text file using LoadVars every 15 to 30 seconds. After a while, it seems to stop loading the file and just set all text prices to zero. sometimes the flash animations might continue to play while the text is zero, but sometimes it seems to freeze completely on the very first frame of animation, so that parts of the screen may be white, just like the first frame in the flash editor looks.p  pOnce we connect to one of these devices remotely using logmein, it starts to work again, which i believe may be because the screen is quickly refreshed which starts the animation again.p  pIve done some research, and ive come to find that playing full screen for a period of time while hardware acceleration is on can cause this to happen, however, turning off hardware acceleration is not an option as the animation looks like crap.p  pThere seems to be no correlation between flash player version or hardware and this problem occurring.p  pSo, is there any way to detect an exception in the flash animation from actionscript, or when it just freezes I believe actionscript continues to run happily in the background while the video freezes, although this is yet untested.p  pdoes anybody have any ideas that might solve a problem like this preferably a solution that involves only editing the flash files instead of configuring our clients machines, as we have thousands of devices out there, and configuring them in any way may disrupt our clients businesses.p

I also found the post about memset a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions982682markdataassensitiveinpython983525983525Mark data as sensitive in pythona but Im assuming if I use C to decrypt the hash, this is not helpful. p  pP.P.S. The dycrypter is currentlt a python script. If I were to add memset to the script and then compile it using py2exe or pyinstaller....would this actually do anything to help protect the password My instincts say no, since all pyinstaller does is package up the normal interpreter and the same bytecode the local interpreter creates...but I dont know enough about it...  p  hr  pSo...following Ayas suggestion of making the encryption module in C, how much of a discernible memory footprint would the following setup leave. Part of the big issue is the ability to decrypt the password must remain available throughout the run of the program as it will be called repeatedly...its not a onetime thing. p  pMake a C object which is started when the user logins in. It contains the decryption routine and the holds a copy of the salt entered by the user at login. The stored salt is obscured in the running object in memory by having been hashed by its own encryption routine using a randomly generated salt. p  pThe randomly generated salt would still have to be held in a variable in the object too. This is not really to secure the salt, but just to try and obfuscate the memory footprint if someone should take a peek at it making the salt hard to identify.  I.e.  cobj p  precodemlock to keep the code memory resident no swap  char encryptdata, salt      ...      return encrypteddata   char decryptdata, salt      ...      return decrypteddata   streamcallbackstreamdata     return decryptstreamdata, decryptsgdhen, jhgtdyuwj   void main      char jhgtdyuwjrand     sgdhen  encryptltrawuserinputgt, jhgtdyuwj  codepre  pThen, the python script calls the C object directly, which passes the unencrypted result right into the MySQLdb call without storing any returns in any variable. I.e.p  precodeusrbinpython encryptedusername  feh9876xhu378xamp457oyx encryptedpassword  deexxhuiexhjfirihyxxhjfkekl  MySQLdb.connecthost, username, password, database db  MySQLdb.connectself.mysqlhost,                      cobj.streamcallabckencryptedusername,                      cobj.streamcallbackencryptedpassword,                      self.mysqldatabase codepre  pWhat kind of memory footprint might this leave which could be snoopedp

Negative 5996 pI am working on a inventory app using c and entity framework code first approach.p  pOne of the design requirements is that user should be able to create multiple companies and each company should have a full set of inventory master tables.p  pFor example each company should have its own stock journal and list of items. There would also be a way to combine these companies in future to form like a group company, essentially merging the data. p  pUsing one of the file based RDBMS like sqlite, its very simple, I would just need to create a separate sqlite database for each company and then a master database to tie it all together. However how should I go about doing it in a single database file not multiple file databases. I do not want to have a company column on every tablep  pThe idea that I had given my limited knowledge of DBs is to separate using different schemas. One schema for each company with the same set of tables in each schema, with a separate schema holing the common tables and tables to tie up the other schemas together. Is that a good approach Because I am having a hard time finding a way to dynamically create schemas using ef and code first.p  pemEdit 1emp  pTo get an idea of the number of companies, one enterprise has about 45 companies, and each financial year the old companies are closed off and a fresh set of companies created. It is essentially good to maintain data for multiple years in the same file but it is not required as long as I can provide a separate module to load data for several years, from several of the db files to facilitate year on year analysis.p  pAs far as size of individual companies data, it can hit the GB mark per company.p  pSchema changes quite frequently at least on the table level as it will be completely customizable by the user.p  pI guess one aspect that drives my question is the implementation of this design. If it is a app with discrete desktop interface and implementation and I have my on RDBMS server like SQL Server the number of databases do not matter that much. However for a webbased UI hosted on third party and using their database server, the number of databases available will be limited. The only solution to that would be to use serverless database like SQLite. But as far as general advice goes, SQLite is not advised for large enterprise class databases.p

Negative 5996 pIve been trying for days to get mail to send to peoples inboxes instead of being routed to spam folders and Im coming up against a major wall.p  pIve searched and search, on here and other forums, and Ive tried every fix I could find.

Negative 5996 pIm in the process of programming a java rpg game, and have reached an impass. My code currently has sprite animation, a random map generation with perlin noise and collision detection. The map is tiled base, so im currently trying to convert the perlin noise to tiles. The perlin functions generate a array, and im each number of that array to a tile png. This is where the problem comes RUNTIME ERROR Java.Lang.NullPointerException. The probleme is my compiler netbeans does not show me where the error occurs, but instead only gives me this error code. With a process of exclusion I managed to locate the error, which occurs at line 364. If this site doesnt support lines, it is at the loadTile method, at ifperlinIsland[x][y] lt 0.05blockImg[x][y]  TILE[0]. I believe all the variables are correctly initialized, but I cant manage to find a solution. Please excuse the long code, but I included everything for the sake of information.

Negative 5996 pThis question was asked an year ago and I want to ask again as earlier the answer was not straightforward . I am hoping we have clarity on it now.p  pMy question relates to best way to develop a single client for IOS and Android based devices for a simple data entry type application.The app will not use any  device specific features like GPS, Camera etc  The following is my understanding , feel free to correct or addp  ol liHTML5Javascript based client is best ie from write once run everywhere perspective so long as device has a connection to the central web server.li liFor native IOSAndroid device clients I am not clear which SDK should be used. I need to have an offline data entry capability  in the client, just in case device is disconnected for later syncup with server. Again I am looking for write once run everywhere type of client.li liIs XMLRPC based interaction best way for device client to communicate with the central web server.li liAsusming I develop an IOS based client for smartphone, what extra work is required to run it on the IPAD . I mean whether it can be done via xml  config or will it require development separately.li ol  pThanks in advance. Sohailp
Negative 5996 pI have written a VBA program which creates, on codeWorkbookOpencode, a file stream that writes errors to an error log.  If I run into a fatal error and therefore need to halt execution of the macro, the program executes an codeEndcode statement, abruptly halting the macro.  I know that this solution is not an ideal one, but I cant see a better way to end things quickly if Im several functions deep i.e., one function has called another which has called yet another, and the third function produces the error.  Exiting the function in which the error occurred will only affect that particular function, leading to the possibility of invalid data, unexpected cell values, etc.p  pBut this approach leads me to another problem  when codeEndcode executes it destroys all of my objects, including the error stream.  So when the user does something new and runs across a fatal error, they get a VBA runtime error 91 Object ... not set because the code writes to the file stream thats now set to codeNothing.codep  pIs there a better way to end the macro and thus avoid unexpected behaviour after an error without losing all of my objects  The official VBA documentation is of no help.  Thanks in advance.    p

Negative 5996 pI need an advice for choosing sheet while reading through loads of Excelspreadsheets. The firm Im working for already has a big database of 100 Excelspreadsheets, where I am searching for values in a specific sheet. The problem is that the name and index of the spreadsheet variates, especially when it comes to the old documents. Ive tried both codesheetbyidex6code and codesheetbynamenamecode, but I cant seem to get it right. p  pWhen searching for codesheetbyindex6code, the problem is that the index changes in some documents, from for example index 5 to index 6. Another problem is that they also have hidden sheets, which Im not sure if will interrupt or just become the last indexes. p  pWhen searching for codesheetbynamenamecode, the problem is that the sheet name in most cases is called Ship Res.

Negative 5996 pI have a UICollectionView as the top view on my view hierarchy in IB. Its making use of a custom layout that splits the cells registered from nibs along the left and right edges of the view, with decoration views behind and a supplementary view the size of the entire view on top of the cells. All of that works as expected. p  pWhat doesnt work is that selecting cells is simply not being registered. Theyre not firing calls to codecollectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPathcode the delegate is set correctly, nor is the highlighted state of the images within the nib working. Its acting rather like a view higher up is consuming the tap, but the collectionView is the top view. Ive tried removing the overlaid supplementary view and background decoration views, and also tried temporarily converting to using a flow layout in case my custom layout was doing something screwy  still nothing. Making this even more frustrating is the fact Im using collectionViews on other view controllers in this app governed by flow layouts, and they work perfectly fine without any special customisation. Im out of options, any ideasp

Negative 5996 pI know this question has been asked a lot, but the usual answers are far from satisfying in my view.p  pgiven the following class hierarchyp  precodeclass SuperClass class SubClass extends SuperClass codepre  pwhy does people use this pattern to instantiate SubClassp  precodeSuperClass instance  new SubClass codepre  pinstead of this onep  precodeSubClass instance  new SubClass codepre  pNow, the usual answer I see is that this is in order to send codeinstancecode as an argument to a method that requires an instance of SuperClass like herep  precodevoid aFunctionSuperClass param  somewhere else in the code... ... aFunctioninstance ... codepre  pBut I can send an instance of SubClass to aFunction regardless of the type of variable that held it  meaning the following code will compile and run with no errors assuming the previously provided definition of aFunctionp  precodeSubClass instance  new SubClass aFunctioninstance codepre  pIn fact, AFAIK variable types are meaningless at runtime. They are used only by the compilerp  pAnother possible reason to define a variable as SuperClass would be if it had several different subclasses and the variable is supposed to switch its reference to several of them at runtime, but I for example only saw this happen in class not super, not sub. just class. Definitly not sufficient to require a general pattern...p

Negative 5996 pIve been looking for a way to find the the vertices within a certain radius from a given point. One way to this is brute force. After selection of a point raypicking, loop over all vertices, check whether it is within a set radius and voila. However, this tends to get quite slow for models with lots of vertices.p  pWhat I would want to do is use raypicking to select a point on the model. This would give me the face this point is on. Then from that face I can get the vertices belonging to that face. These vertices can be shared over faces. This might allow me to forward search from this point, flagging visited vertices and stop whenever the distance reaches the set maximum radius. However, from what I can see from a dump of the geometry I can get the vertices belonging to a face directly, but theres no way to get the faces that a vertex belongs to. That is without preprocessing. Am I right here, or did I miss somethingp

To avoid this problem, you can use   stopSelfint to ensure that your request to stop the service is   always based on the most recent start request. That is, when you call   stopSelfint, you pass the ID of the start request the startId   delivered to onStartCommand to which your stop request corresponds.   Then if the service received a new start request before you were able   to call stopSelfint, then the ID will not match and the service will   not stop.p blockquote  pMy question is, what will happen, if I invoke stopSelf with last startId, and still some earlier start is still not finished. In that case, the startId will match, and according to that document the service will die All all other earlier starts will just be killed p  pIf the answer is yes, then what is the best practice to achieve that the service will not be killed until all earlier start is not finished.p

Negative 5996 pSo, I have a main indexedDB objectstore with around 30.000 records on which I have to run full text search queries. Doing this with the ydn fts plugin this generates a second objectstore with around 300.000 records. Now, as generating this index datastore takes quite long I figured it had be faster to distribute the content of the index as well. This in turn generated a zip file of around 7MB which after decompressing on the client side gives more than 40MB of data. Currently I loop over this data inserting it one by one async, so callback time is used to parse next lines which takes around 20 minutes. As I am doing this in the background of my application through a webworker this is not entirely unacceptable, but still feels hugely inefficient. Once it has been populated the database is actually fast enough to be even used on mid to high end mobile devices, however the population time of 20 minutes to one hour on mobile devices is just crazy. Any suggestions how this could be improved Or is the only option minimizing the number of records which would mean writing my own full text search... not something I would look forward top

Negative 5996 h1Questionh1  pFor Java web applications, if you put classes where the web server expects them on your development machine, it can save you the step of packaging and redeploying your webapp every time you compile.  It also simplifies things to have the development and deployment directory structure the same.  a hrefhttpstomcat.apache.orgtomcat7.0docappdevdeployment.htmlStandardDirectoryLayout relnofollowTomcats Standard Directory Layouta isp  precodeWEBINF WEBINFclasses WEBINFlib codepre  pBut SBT wants to put all classes inp  precodetargetscala2.10classes codepre  pHow do I tell sbt to put classes in codeWEBINFclassescode insteadp  h1Backgroundh1  pSo far, Ive been using SBT just for unit tests and I run it from codeWEBINFcode instead of my projects root directory and dont worry about where it throws the classes because tests dont need to be deployed.  I guess I could wrap SBT in a batch file that cds to WEBINF, then cds back when done, but that seems a little kludgey.p  pHow do people work around this issue  I could delete codeWEBINFclassescode then a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11065064copyingfilesusingsbtcopya codetargetscala2.10classescode to it after each build, but that might eliminate some of the benefits of incrementalminimal compilation that SBT offers.p  h1Extra Credit...h1  pIm not sure if this is part of a new question, but it falls under using SBT to build a Java web app so Ill include it  Tools like log4j, Struts, proxool, and Hibernate all seem to expect files and subdirectories recursively to be copied from codesrcmainresourcescode to codeclassescode on each build, and I could copy them explicitly the way I do with the Ant build now.  But if SBT had a webappdefaults, mavendefaults, or javadefaults template or something, that would be helpful to know about.p

So for example I want all rows with a date befor january 2014.p  pHow would I do this in MySQL Only considering the month does not work, because it will give me also rows with a month smaller, but a year after my year.

This means that even if I have different values for the invoiceitem, they will not be updated.p  pOther than doing a SELECT before the UPDATE, is there SQL query or PHP functions that will tell me if the UPDATE matched any row, so that I can proceeed to UPDATE invoiceitem accordinglyp

Negative 5996 pIm using a Windows Forms codeListViewcode control to display a list of items, up to 1000 items in total, though only about 20 are visible within the listview at one time listview is using Details view.p  pIm frequently adding new items to the bottom of the listview, and scroll to the newly added item automatically using codeitem.EnsureVisiblecode so the user can see the most recent data.  When the list size is above 1000 items, I remove the oldest list item i.e. index 0, the one at the top of the listview from the list to keep it at 1000 items.p  pNow to my problemp  pWhenever the selection in the listview changes, additional details associated with the item are shown elsewhere in the form.  When this selection change occurs, I stop the autoscrolltonewitems so the users selected item stays where it is i.e. the list doesnt scroll to newest items when an item in it is selected, and only reenable the autoscrolltonewest when the user dismisses the additional details part of the form.p  pThis all works fine, emexceptem when I remove the oldest item from the listview to ensure the list doesnt grow beyond 1000 items When I remove that oldest item, the listview scrolls everything up by 1 automatically i.e. nothing Ive done programatically does this scrolling.  I realise that if the selected item is one of the earliest 20 events which makes the earliest 20 events the visible ones, it will have no choice but to scroll the visible items when it removes the earliest, but if the selection is, say, midway through the list, it should have no need to scroll the listview items.p  pIs there any way I can prevent the listview automatically scrolling up by one when I remove the oldest item  Or will I have to work around it by making sure the visible items remain in the position they were before I removed the oldest item, after removing it which seems a real hasslep

Negative 5996 pI am trying to render a texture to a simple opengl square. I just want to map the texture directly onto the rectangle. I followed the scene graph example, located a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt5qtquickscenegraphopenglunderqmlexample.html relnofollowherea, on how to call opengl functions and display shapes, but im lost with trying to add a texture. I checked through multiple docs and they all dealt with using the fixed function pipeline, or subclassing QGLWidget. I would like to keep this example OpenGL ES and with utilizing shaders.p  pI am new to OpenGL so if anyone could give me an understanding of what has to happen, that would be wonderful.p

Negative 5996 pI thought that a emsingle resourceem can be identified by emmany URLsem.p  pa hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforummsghaldiscussoIARnoKInpM5FE40uIJAOAJ relnofollowFromap  blockquote   pA resource in a hypermedia API is probably better thought of   representing the API response rather than the underlying model   instance, as the response is obviously not the same from these two   URLsp blockquote  pBut above quote suggests that in REST each URL always identifies a emdifferent resourceem  thus two URLs can never identify the emsame resourceem . Reason being that a emresourceem in a hypermedia API is better thought of as representing the emAPI responseem rather than the emunderlying model instanceem, and considering that emAPI responsesem from different URLs are definitely not identical, the conclusion is that two URLs can never identify the same emresourceem.p  pWould you agree that in REST a emresourceem should be thought of as representing the emAPI responseem and as such two URLs can never identify the same emresourceemp  pThank youp

Negative 5996 pI am new to software security, but so far reading about software signing on Android, I understand software signing is useful to prevent someone from injecting code inside your code. The user of the software can compare the software hash with your signature using your signatures public key, and if they dont match so the software is altered.p  pWhat I dont understand is how this really ensures protection using self signing software. What prevents someone from changing my software, injecting his code inside it, taking my self signed signature off, and making a brand new one on top of it this way this new signature will say that everything is ok with the software and I will only find it out IF I have access to the modified software right Or is it there something that I am not understating about the process p

Negative 5996 pAt the moment I am working with a phpscript that reads data from a xmlfile. The user first has to select on which xml entry he wants to get more information by using a dropdownmenu, then he sends the form to the same phppage by clicking the submit button. Because the page reloads, it is able to see that something has been send by POST and can then show the requested information to this xml entry on the bottom of the page.p  pBut I would like to make it a bit more userfriendly. The idea is that when someone chooses an entry from the dropdown, the requested information is shown without having to click the submit button and of course without reloading the whole page. That means that the POST form is being send in the background and the information appears directly after choosing an item from the dropdown.p  pI know that this is possible using jQuery and AJAX, but Im not really experienced in one of these languages. Anyone got an idea how to solve this p  pThanksp

Negative 5996 pIm making a 2D platformer that features a dynamic camera. The camera must track 4 players at once so that theyre all on the screen. In addition the camera must not move beyond a predefined rectangle boundary. Ive tried implementing it but I just cant seem to get the process of zooming the camera so that its always close as possible to the four objects.p  pThe general algorithm I have so far is   1. Define the viewing space by calculating a 2D axis aligned bounding box using the 4 object positions being tracked and use its center as a camera postion or averaging 2. Calculate an orthographic size by using the largest x OR y value using a vector from the cameras position to each object being tracked.p  ol liIf the camera is beyond the cameras boundary calculate the excess amount and displace in the opposite direction.li ol  pThis seems simple enough on paper but I cant seem to get a correct working implementation.p

Negative 5996 pFirstly I shall note, my program needs only work on Linux, built with a modern version of GCC so portability concerns are not terribly relevant here the software is already using highly platform specific features for low level hardware functionality.p  pI have been having a problem by which I have a number of processes, a parent and some children. The parent has the receiving end of a POSIX message queue and the children each have a sending end. The children are in effect receiving messages over a network details irrelevant here and sending them to the parent which then processes the data and stores it. This is working fine for the vast majority of my use case.p  pHowever I have just had to add functionality by which clients over the network need to request small amounts of data as well as just sending it however sending will still be the main case.p  pMy initial plan was to use the codepipecode syscall in the child when it received this neq type of request and have it send a special message to the parent requesting the parent open the pipe and send some data back to the child. However this approach was cut short when I discovered that file descriptors can only be sent over domain sockets and not message queues.p  pI then realized while playing with a bash shell that it is possible to use procpidofchildfdpipefd where pidofchild is the PID of the child process and pipefd is the file descriptor of the write end of the pipe in the child to grab the childs pipe without it having to send it to us.p  pSo, my current plan is to have the child send its PID and the file descriptor of the write end of its pipe down the message queue to the parent, the parent can then open the pipe through the proc filesystem, write the message to the child and then close it again.p  pHowever, looking online I have not been able to find a single case of anyone using this technique for IPC in any program whatsoever so am becoming concerned that there is some huge caveat which I have not considered and is going to make this whole plan fail, what are the concerns I need be aware of when opening another processes pipe through the procxfdy interfacep  pHere is a snippet of my current code note error checking is removed for shortness, also irrelevant lines are removedp  precode Parent Code  static inline void ParentFuncvoid      struct EasySMessage IncomingMQMessage  mallocMQMESSAGESIZE  1      ssizet MQueueMesSize  mqreceiveGlobalsgtEasySMQueue         , IncomingMQMessage, MQMESSAGESIZE  1, NULL     switchIncomingMQMessagegtOpType              case WriteMessage              Process and write the message               SNIP              break         case ReadMessage             char  MyString  FormatProcFDStringIncomingMQMessage             OpenPipeAndReplyIncomingMQMessage, MyString             break         default             printfUnrecognised easys message type dn                 , IncomingMQMessagegtOpType             exit1          freeIncomingMQMessage    Child Code  static int ChildCodemqdt EasySChildMQueue, struct EasySMessage MessageProcessed      sizet SizeToSend  SizeOfMessageMessageProcessed     int Pipes[2]     pipePipes     MessageProcessedgtPipe  Pipes[1]     MessageProcessedgtPid  getpid     mqsendEasySChildMQueue, MessageProcessed, SizeToSend, 0     ReadFromPipeAndReplyPipes     return 0  codepre

Negative 5996 pI am trying to archive mailboxes which are no longer needed from an onpremises Exchange 2010 environment to PST files in a directory on a remote server share.  My problem is that I am unable to figure out the proper syntax in PowerShell to somewhat automate this process.  The closest that Ive come to it working is the single quotes being replaced by whitespaces in my PowerShell command.p  pSo, I try to run the following as an example from PS on one of our Exchange 2010 serversp  precodeGetMailbox test.user  Where .OrganizationalUnit eq domain.comUsersTEMP  ForEach NewMailboxExportRequest Mailbox .Alias FilePath serversharePSTdir.Alias.pst codepre  pThe emtest.userem is only being used in the example as a test mailbox until I can work out the PowerShell syntax needed to make this work.  Once the syntax works, Ill remove the individual emtest.userem mailbox and let PS send all mailboxes through the pipe.p  pWhen I am using the example, I can check the status of the move request by using strongGetMailboxExportRequeststrong.  When I check the status, I see that the file path does not contain the properly formatted file path information.  From the example, this is what part of the command is being formatted as in PSp  precodeNewMailboxExportRequest Mailbox test.user FilePath serversharePSTdir test.user .pst codepre  pNote there is now a space in emPSTdir test.userem and also a space before the .pst in emtest.user .pstem.  Ive tried using single and double quotes, Ive changed the location of the quotes, used escape character, etc., but Ive not been able to figure out what I am missing.  It seems that the single quote in the example is replaced with a whitespace character which I need to be removed.  The command should look something like this with no spaces in the file pathp  precodeNewMailboxExportRequest Mailbox test.user FilePath serversharePSTdirtest.user.pst codepre  pstrongemQemstrong  How can I pass the variable em.Aliasem through the PS pipe so that the name in the file path does not contain any spaces.p

Negative 5996 pI see that theres an onDisconnect firebase method, however it looks like that method is intended to update other client devices that the current client device has gone offline. For me this isnt very useful. All of our API calls are coming from a central server which handles updates to our other client devices.p  pBasically, I only have 1 client device communicating with the firebase server... ever. So my question is, when that single device loses connection how will I know This is probably the most frustrating part of all, Not only do I not know when I lose connection, but Im still making calls as if  each command is successful. p  pOffline Behaviorp  pEvery client sharing a Firebase maintains its own internal version of any active data. When data is updated or saved, it is written to this local version of the Firebase. The Firebase client then synchronizes that data with the Firebase servers and with other clients on a besteffort basis.p  pAs a result, all writes to Firebase will trigger local events immediately, before any data has even been written to the server. This means the app will remain responsive regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity.p  pOnce connectivity is reestablished, well receive the appropriate set of events so that the client catches up with the current server state, without having to write any custom code.p

So the second one in line.p  pFor more clarity, Youre making an application in delphi, when youre debugging your form will pop up but what I am looking for is that the HWND of RAD Studio is returned instead of your own form.p  pHope its better to understand now.p  pP.s. David got what I meant with his last comment.p

Negative 5996 pI am well aware of the differences between an interface and an abstract class. This is more sort of a philosophical question. p  pI would like to know if there is any particular scenario in which it would be more appropriate to use an ALL abstract class in place of an interface.p  pNote that by ALL abstract I mean that the classe has only abstract properties and methods. No reusable behaviour.p

Negative 5996 pIm developing a Client and Server side application in .NET. There are alot of clients which will contact and use one server. Inbetween the client and the server, a Single Sign on functionality is added, which I have no control over, not source code and configuration options.

When the users are inactive, which means no server calls had been made within a span of 5 minutes, the connection will timeout and no new login prompt is being displayed. p  pThis  Single Signon portal was primarly build for codeASP.NETcode applications, and the web browser will handle all of the cookie related stuff, I guess.p  pAfter some time browsing, I came over the topic a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles86007waystodoWCFinstancemanagementPercallPer relnofollowWCF Instance Managementa.

Since I do not know the source file encoding I have attempted multiple options to see what would provide an unaltered result and oddly the only way that works is having it read in UTF7 and written in UTF8.p  pUTF7 to UTF7 causes problems like amp to change to AC.  UTF8 to UTF8 which I believe is the default converts the character in question to the box.  ASCII to ASCII turns it into . Unicode to Unicode results in gibberish.  Shouldnt it be same encoding read and write for same results Simplified code example belowp  precodeusing var fileStream  new FileStreamfileName, FileMode.Open using var fileReader  new StreamReaderfileStream,Encoding.UTF7 using var fileStreamOut  new FileStreamtempFileName,FileMode.Create using var fileWriter  new StreamWriterfileStreamOut,Encoding.UTF8                      while fileReader.EndOfStream              var inputLine  fileReader.ReadLine          if inputLine  null                      inputLine  inputLine.Substring0, 3  newRdfi  inputLine.Substring12             fileWriter.WriteLineinputLine                    fileWriter.Flush  codepre

Negative 5996 pIm new to StackOverflow and also new to Android development, and I have run into quite an irritating issue with a certain app that I am developing.  I have two buttons on my main activity, an Add Customer button and a Show Customers button, each leading to their own respective activities.p  pAt first, only the Add Customer button would work and successfully go to its activity with no issues. The Show Customers button would cause the app to force close.p  pAt this point, I had thought that my Show Customers button was not working correctly, so to test this I had switched the activities for which each button was leading to in order to see if the Add Customer button would again successfully lead to the Show Customers activity.  Upon testing this, the Add Customer button actually now caused the app to force close and the Show Customers button worked and went to the Add Customer activity.p  pAfter completing this, I knew that there was something wrong with the actual Show Customers activity and not the Show Customers button itself, but I am completely stuck as to why it is not working. All activities are in the manifest.  I believe there is something wrong with my Show Customer xml code.

Negative 5996 pI am new to programming very new so sorry if this is a stupid question and I was wondering how you change an int of a variable into a constant value in C e.g. if I was to input a month in number form to a variable month, then a function convertMonthToDays lets say would change that inputted integer into a corresponding constant. So 3 would be equal to MARCH which is a constant defined as 30.p  pThank you p

Im not sure about where it should be set. This is why here Im falling back to a default audience ID enough for my testing purposes, going to eat the elephant one bite at a time.p  pAnother key component here is the JWT token formatter, which is in charge of building the JWT token from the ticket. In my implementation I inject in its constructor a function to retrieve my EF data context, as the formatter requires it in order to get the audiences secret key. The required audience ID comes from metadata properties set by the above code, and is used to lookup the store for an codeAudiencecode entity. If not found I fall back to a default audience defined in my codeWeb.configcode this is the test client app I use. Once I have the audience secret key I can create the signing credentials for the token, and use it together with data from context to build my JWT.p  precodepublic class ApplicationJwtFormat  ISecureDataFormatltAuthenticationTicketgt      private readonly FuncltIanitorContextgt contextGetter     private string sIssuer     public const string AUDIENCEPROPKEY  audience      private const string SIGNATUREALGORITHM  httpwww.w3.org200104xmldsigmorehmacsha256     private const string DIGESTALGORITHM  httpwww.w3.org200104xmlencsha256      public string Issuer              get  return sIssuer          set                      if value  null throw new ArgumentNullExceptionvalue             sIssuer  value                    public ApplicationJwtFormatFuncltIanitorContextgt contextGetter              if contextGetter  null throw new ArgumentNullExceptioncontextGetter          contextGetter  contextGetter         Issuer  httplocalhost50505           public string ProtectAuthenticationTicket data              if data  null throw new ArgumentNullExceptiondata           get the audience ID from the ticket properties as set by ApplicationOAuthProvider          GrantResourceOwnerCredentials from its OAuth client ID         string sAudienceId  data.Properties.Dictionary.ContainsKeyAUDIENCEPROPKEY              data.Properties.Dictionary[AUDIENCEPROPKEY]              null           get audience data         Audience audience         using IanitorContext db  contextGetter                      audience  db.Audiences.FirstOrDefaulta gt a.Id  sAudienceId                  new Audience                                      Id  ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[audienceId],                     Name  ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[audienceName],                     Base64Secret  ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[audienceSecret]                                    byte[] key  TextEncodings.Base64Url.Decodeaudience.Base64Secret          DateTimeOffset issued  data.Properties.IssuedUtc               new DateTimeOffsetDateTime.UtcNow         DateTimeOffset expires  data.Properties.ExpiresUtc          SigningCredentials credentials  new SigningCredentials             new InMemorySymmetricSecurityKeykey,             SIGNATUREALGORITHM,             DIGESTALGORITHM          JwtSecurityToken token  new JwtSecurityTokensIssuer,             audience.Id,             data.Identity.Claims,             issued.Value.UtcDateTime,             expires.Value.UtcDateTime,             credentials          return new JwtSecurityTokenHandler.WriteTokentoken           public AuthenticationTicket Unprotectstring protectedText              throw new NotImplementedException       codepre  h34.

Negative 5996 pI am facing an issue, possibly quite easy to solve, I am just new to advanced transaction settings.p  pEvery 30 minutes I am running an codeINSERTcode query that is getting latest data from a linked server to my clients server, to a table we can call emImportTableem. For this I have a simple job that looks like thisp  precodeBEGIN TRAN      DELETE FROM  ImportTable       INSERT INTO ImportTable columns           SELECT columns           FROM QueryGettingResultsFromLinkedServer COMMIT codepre  pThe thing is, each time the job runs the emImportTableem is locked for the query run time 25 minutes and nobody can read the records. strongI wish the table to be readaccessible all the time, with as little downtime as possible.strongp  pNow, I read that it is possible to allow codeSNAPSHOT ISOLATIONcode in the database settings that could probably solve my problem set to codeFALSEcode at the moment, but I have never played with different transaction isolation types and as this is not my DB but my clients, Id rather not alter any database settings if I am not sure if it can break something.p  pI know I could have an intermediary table that the records are inserted to and then inserted to the final table and that is certainly a possible solution, I was just hoping for something more sophisticated and learning something new in the process.p  pPS My clients server amp database is fairly new and barely used, so I expect very little impact if I change some settings, but still, I cannot just randomly change various settings for learning purposes.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 5996 pIm working on a custom CMS where CKEditor 4.5.1 is integrated for friendly HTML content generation.p  pOne of the features were shipping is the ability to restrict parts of the page to specific groups of users and the cleanest way to do that as far as I could tell was create a new tag and use that for tracking of content, e.g. codeltrestrict datausertype1,2,3gtrestricted content for user types 1, 2, 3 hereltrestrictgtcode which would be stripped out by the backend.p  pThe problem I have is that my custom tag implicitly needs to support both block and inline tags, and Im not sure how to set this up correctly.p  pIve tried a variety of combinations of things which either disallow any content being added at all, or disable the plugin entirely because it falls foul of ACFs own sanity checking right now the configuration I have will let me add the codeltrestrictgtcode block, will let me edit it in the dialog including by doubleclicking but will not let me nest any content of any kind and will cause CKEditor to throw a could not read attributes of null warning when switching back to source mode.p  pMy current configuration of this plugin is as followsp  precode    CKEDITOR.dtd.restrict           a 1, abbr 1, address 1, area 1, article 1, aside 1, audio 1, b 1, bdi 1, bdo 1, blockquote 1,         br 1, button 1, canvas 1, cite 1, code 1, command 1, datalist 1, del 1, details 1, dfn 1, div 1,         dl 1, em 1, embed 1, fieldset 1, figure 1, footer 1, form 1, h1 1, h2 1, h3 1, h4 1, h5 1, h6 1,         header 1, hgroup 1, hr 1, i 1, iframe 1, img 1, input 1, ins 1, kbd 1, keygen 1, label 1, map 1,         mark 1, meter 1, noscript 1, object 1, ol 1, output 1, progress 1, p 1, pre 1, q 1, ruby 1, s 1,         samp 1, script 1, section 1, select 1, small 1, span 1, strong 1, sub 1, sup 1, table 1,         textarea 1, time 1, u 1, ul 1, var 1, video 1, wbr 1,  1       Allow ltrestrictgt as a valid tag.

Negative 5996 pI would like to compare the death penalty method with other penalty methods proposed in the Genetic Algorithms literature.p  pIm using the R software, so I need to write the codes of these penalty methods.  Ive finding lots of difficulties because I have not understood one thing about the death penalty function how I have to handle the infeasible offsprings since the population size usually is fixed in genetic algorithms p  pI mean, I understand that, in order to use appropriately the death penalty, I have to initialize the genetic algorithm with all feasible solutions. But even if I have all feasible solutions in the first population t0, I could have infeasible solutions in the next generation since the crossover and the mutations  are blind operators.p  pSo, since the death penalty rejects all the infeasible solutions, then what happen Will the next generation have a population side smaller original dim size  number of infeasible solutions or I have to select more parents to put in the mating pool for reproduction until the next generation is composed by original dim size feasible offsprings or I have to try again the genetic operators until all the individuals in t1 are feasiblep

Negative 5996 pI am trying to use the sockets package for Octave on my Ubuntu. I am using the Java Sockets API for connecting to Octave. The Java program is the client, Octave is my server. I just tried your code examplep  pa hrefhttppauldreik.blogspot.de200904octavesocketsexample.html relnofollowhttppauldreik.blogspot.de200904octavesocketsexample.htmlap  pThere are two problemsp  p1.p  pUsing SOCKSTREAM, for some strange reason, certain bytes are being received by recv right after accept, even if Im not sending anything from the client. Subsequent messages I send with Java have no effect, it seems the Octave socket completely has its own idea about what it thinks it receives, regardless of what Im actually sending.p  p2.p  pUsing SOCKDGRAM, there is another problem I do get a reception of my actual message this way, but it seems that a recv command doesnt remove the first element from the datagram queue. Until I send the second datagram to the socket, any subsequent recv commands will repeatedly read the first datagram as if it were still in the queue. So the recv function doesnt even block to wait for an actually new available datagram. Instead, it simply reads the same old one again. This is useless, since I cannot tell my server to wait for news from the client.p  pIs this how UDP is supposed to behave I thought datagram packets are really removed from the datagram queue by recv.p  pThis is my server side codep  precodessocketAFINET, SOCKDGRAM, 0 binds,12345 [config,count]  recvs, 10 [test,count]  recvs, 4 codepre  pAnd this is my Java clientp  precodepublic LiveSeparationClientString host, int port, byte channels, byte sampleSize, int sampleRate, int millisecondsPerFrame throws UnknownHostException, IOException  this.port  port socket  new DatagramSocket this.host  InetAddress.getByNamehost DatagramPacket packet  new DatagramPacketByteBuffer.allocate10 .putnew byte[]channels, sampleSize .putIntsampleRate .putIntmillisecondsPerFrame .array, 10, this.host, port  socket.sendpacket samplesPerFrame  int Math.floordoublemillisecondsPerFrame  1000.0  doublesampleRate  codepre  pAs you see, Im sending 10 Bytes and receiving all 10 this works so far with recvs, 10. In the later part of my Java program, packets will be generated and send also, but this may take some seconds. In the mean time, the second receive, recvs, 4, in Octave should wait for a really new datagram package. But this doesnt happen, is simply reads the first 4 Bytes of the same old package again. recv doesnt block the second time.p  pI hope it is not a problem for you to fix thisp  pThanks in advance p  pMarvinp  pP.S. Also, I dont undertstand why listen and accept are both necessary when using SOCKSTREAM, but not for SOCKDGRAM.p

Very little is given on the retrofit website on how to use the callback. Assume all the other code is working fine. Here codeMovieResponsecode object is returned by the movieDB API which contains an array of codeMoviecodes and some extra information. I am implementing it in such a way so that once I get the response in codeMovieResponsecode from there I can extract using the codegetMoviescode which will return a list of movies. p  pWhen I run I simply get codenull object referencecode because coderesponsecode is null. I tried to search for tutorials on using new codeRetrofit2.0.0code especially on using enqueue function but I am out of luck. Plus one more question where should the codeupdateMoviescode be called. Can I call it directly in the mainactivity. Does retrofit automatically run the network call on background thread  p

Negative 5996 pHow can I configure Monolog to output PHP errors within the response, as would have been done without Monologp  pWhat I want to do is when, for example, a PHP EERROR occurs within a PHP page, that error message will be output to the response, and also passed to any other Handlers set for Monolog.p  pAFAIK, I might use StreamHandler and have it output to stdout, but dont know how to do this or if it will work as expectedp  pThere are two variations Id like the option ofp  ol liMonolog reformats the error message before having it output within the responseli liMonolog relays the error or exception back to PHP native error handling so that it outputs the message in the same format in the response as if Monolog was not mediating itli ol  pHow could I achieve these I dont even know how I can get Monolog to register itself as a handler for exceptions and errors.

Negative 5996 pMy question is that, does the MapReduce framework for example Hadoop implementation, assign the inputs for mappers before mapper job starts or it is done at runtimep  pThat is, assume I have some input codeicode, and machines codem1,m2 .. mkcode. The machines need not to be equally powered, some may have better performance CPU,Memory than other. If the master node splits the inputs to mappers until the mapper task begins, or at least assigns the inputs to particular mapper node, there may be the case that some machines stronger ones could finish their job and wait. However, if the split job is done on the runtime, this problem does not arise. p  pIf you also indicate the overall split mechanism of codeMapReducecode in preMapper phase, I would be happy. p
