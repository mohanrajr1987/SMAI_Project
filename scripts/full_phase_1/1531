Positive 1531 pThe title sums it up. I came across an odd discrepancy in backslash escaping between regular expression literals and constructor functions with codenew RegExpcode, and I was curious about whats behind it.p  pI was trying to escape a parenthesis codecode inside a constructor, like sop  precodevar search  new RegExp, g var result  test.matchsearch codepre  pBut this kept returning an error. The match worked fine inside a literal codegcode, but inside the constructor I ended up having to do something like thisp  precodesearch  new RegExp, g codepre  pCan someone please explain to me why an escaping backslash requires an escaping backslash itself in a constructor, but not a literalp

However, their initialization is not the same, so they are in respective daughters constructorsp  precodeclass   Daughter1  public Mother  public     Daughter1  Initialize mothers stuff     Daughter1   class   Daughter2  public Mother  public     Daughter2  Initialize mothers stuff in a different way than Daughter1     Daughter2  codepre  pThe problem is sometimes, a daughter constructor can fail to load its stuff and throws an exception. And when I declare a Daughter like thisp  precodeDaughter1   daughter codepre  pAnd the constructor throws an exception, it calls the mothers destructor, which try to delete its stuff without an initialization, that lead inevitably to a segmentation fault.p  pWhat is the best way to avoid this kind of troublep  hr  pMost of my stuff is composed of pointers, so I know I could simply initialize them to codenullptrcode in the mother constructor and check them before trying a deletion in the destructor, but it only works with pointer and Im looking for a global solution.p

Positive 1531 pI found this code somewhere, and I have found several people asking questions about why their implementation wasnt working, and every single fix is essentially the same code Ive written myself, but there is a runtime error and I am not sure why.

Positive 1531 pI am creating this software for a project and what i did was i created a method Salad here what happens is user can select maximum number of 2 salads.the names of the salad are coming from the database and i created checkboxes  dynamically.p  pThis works fine and I can get the values and insert it to the database.so then what i wanted was to update the inserted row.i created a method to codesetselectedcode the all the checkboxes that user selected before. so as i told above i created this method to select maximum no of 2 check boxes .when i try to insert it works fine..but when i try to update that ActionListener does not work.p  pI am using codesetSelectedtruecode in constructor that  codeActionListenercode  is not triggering.

Positive 1531 pI dont think this is possible, but I thought Id ask anyway. Assume, for example, that I have a constructed object that is closely coupled with another [private] variable in its scopep  precodefunction       var coupledVariable  test, id  0     function Constructor  this.id  id      Constructor.prototype.talk  function          if this.id  0  console.logcoupledVariable          else  console.logsomething else           var c  new Constructor     c.talk  test     new Constructor.talk  something else     delete c   codepre  pIs there a way that I can also delete the codecoupledVariablecode automatically when the first object, codeccode, is deleted, since it is only related to that object. I like keeping it separate from the constructor, since that way its private i.e. inaccessible, except via the functions, but this means that its not garbage collected when the object is deleted. It would be nice if there were a delete event listener that ran before object deletion where I could put some code, but I dont think there is.p

Positive 1531 pI am not sure where to put my if statements because I get an error when in the constructor and Im not sure where else to put them. p  precodeimport java.awt.Color    Create a class called GrowingDot. This will draw a circle on the screen  in a specified color. Every time it is drawn it will increase   in size until it reaches a maximum size and then it will be reset  to its minimum size and start growing again.    The class will need 4 class variables. Declare 3 ints the x, y location  of the circle and the size of the circle.   The class will also need a Color variable to store the circles color.    Create a Constructor that takes two ints and a Color object as   parameters. These represent the x, y coordinates of the circle   in that order and its color. Use the parameters to set the   appropriate class variables.    If the x parameter is less than 0, set the classs variable to 0.  Otherwise, use the value of the parameter. The same should be done  with the y parameter.    If the Color object is null, set the classs variable to red.  Otherwise, use the value of the parameter.    For the size of the circle, it should start off at 5.    Create a getX method that returns an int and takes no parameters. This  should return the x coordinate of the circle.    Create a getY method that returns an int and takes no parameters. This  should return the y coordinate of the circle.    Create a getColor method that returns a Color and takes no parameters.  This should return the color of the circle.    Create a setPosition method that takes two int parameters the x, y   coordinates and returns nothing. If the x parameter is greater than   or equal to 0, update the classs variable to the parameters value.   Otherwise, do nothing. Do the same with the y parameter.    Create a display method that takes a Graphics object as its parameter and  returns nothing. Using the Graphics object draw a filled oval using   the classs size variable for its dimensions and the Color variable   for the color. Use the classs x, y variables as  the coordinates for the circle.    After the circle has been drawn, increase the size variable by 1. If the  new size is greater than 10, change it to 5.      Make sure you format it and include the needed documentation.   public class GrowingDot       int x     int y     int location     Color c      public GrowingDotint x1, int y1, Color color          x  x1         y  y1         c  color          if x1 lt 0              return x  0                 return x1                   if y1 lt 0              return y  0                 return y1                   if color  null              return c  red                 return color                             codepre

Negative 1531 pI have an ASP.NET MVC app which is completely behind Forms Authentication. However there is one set of routes report I need to force integrated windows authentication on, as those pages need to impersonate the current user for security reasons. p  pIf I set the whole site to integrated windows authentication this all works, except that firefox prompts users for the usernamepassword twice as they hit the sites home page once for windows authentication, then again for the forms authentication whereas IE only prompts for forms authentication. This is fine and I know this is the default behavior of Firefox, however so as not to anoy users Ive been asked to restrict the windows authentication requirement to only the report section of the site, so they only get prompted if they go to any page within report.p  pIn ASP.NET WebForms this is easy enough as there is a physcial report folder to place the authentication config on, but in MVC this URL is virtual, so I cant do this. Does anyone know a good way to do this Ive tried to create a gateway aspx page that users need to go through first before redirecting to the appropriate report page, and although Firefox does prompt the user for their windows credentials at the right point, it doesnt seem to keep sending those details for subsequent requests to any of the report pages.

Negative 1531 pTLdr I am not sure how to calculate a smooth transition of thrust between one vector and another.p  pI am programming a simple game where an enemy chases after the player in an open space no walls. I was calculating the enemys x amp y velocities independently, accelerating them if they were taking them in the direction of the player and quickly slowing them if they were going the wrong way e.g. EnemyVelocity.x  0 amp player.x lt enemy.x, then EnemyVelocity.x  2.p  pWhile the gameplay is decently fun trying to dodge the enemy, it is my desire to have the enemy behave using proper physics. What I am currently doing is have the enemy set their thrust think a spaceship based on the angle between them and the player, and have their thrust accelerate up to a max speed calculating side c of the EnemyVelocity triangle. Once that happens, Im not sure the best way to have the thrust adjust itself. If I leave no max speed, the enemy accelerates nicely but will easily overshoot the player, and then take a long time to get enough momentum heading back in the players direction.p  pWhat Id like to happen is have the enemy constantly adjust their velocity on the way to the player, targeting wherever they are at I dont want them to predict where you will be. Then, when they miss the player, Id like for the same thrust amp acceleration formulas to readjust their velocity and send them back at the player.p  pIm thinking this will involve two vectors one where the enemy is currently traveling, and one where the enemy wants to travel the vector that will take them straight to the player. I am not sure how to calculate a smooth transition of thrust between one vector and another.p  pAny tips, formulas or questions will be much appreciated Thank you Stack Overflow.p

Negative 1531 pIve got some Django content that I plan to host on a vps, web facing. It dynamically generates images that are cached to disk regeneration is not often needed except 1user changes content within image or 2 the layout is updated globally so all images need regeneration right now when a user requests a view, it checks to see if whats stored on disk is the latest ie. the global layout has not changed and the user has not changed any content and either fetches the item from disk or generates a new image, stores it and serves it. p  pIve timed the process of generating and storing to disk and it takes around 200ms on a recent MBP running the Django dev server.

If I plan to have a number of other dynamic content that may time some to execute involving images and the like, would I be better advised to host it with say nginx over lighttpd or apache using fastcgi, modwsgi etc Keep in mind I plan to host on a VPS with say 5121GB ram, and that it would be nice if the service degraded gracefully and if there was some way to prevent the process from locking up the server if there are many of requests for new images.p  pI do plan to run more tests as Im not well versed in this area but Id like to know from people with this experience what direction is it best to look in, no point trying things that are known not to work.p

Negative 1531 pI am trying to send emails that will bounce to a known mailbox.  I plan to use VERP.  Unfortunately the System.Net.Mail.MailMessage object does not allow me to precisely set the From and Sender headers within my email  it forces the values so that the resulting email contains the phrase on behalf of, and does not allow me fine control over the relevant mime headers.  I therefore plan to manually write mime email messages directly to the pickup directory so that I can independently control the From and Sender headers.  My dev box is a Vista box and therefore does not have an SMTP server.  I would like to configure the dev box so that I have an SMTP server running on it.  I can then turn off the SMTP server, write messages to the pickup dir, then turn on the SMPT server and see how the individual emails that I have written will behave some delivered, some bounced to a bounce handler on a different email domain, as dictated by the Sender. Two questions 1. Can anyone recommend an SMTP server that will monitor a pickup directory 2. If I set headers as follows Fromaa.com Senderbb.com then the recipient will see the email as having come from aa.com  and wont see any reference to bb.com, but if the mail bounces then the NDR will be sent to bb.com.p  pIts a real pain to have to do this, but I cant see any way of using System.Net.Mail.MailMessage without it messing up my headers.p
Negative 1531 pI work for a school district. Every year we have to export a list of students from our student management system and send it to a company that handles our online exams.p  pSo to do this export, we had to hire someone who knew the inner workings of our student management system. He wrote an sql Adaptive Sybase SQL Anywhere query to export the students to a csv file like we needed. This was before I started working for the district, so for a while I assumed this was an actually application, until it came time for me to do the export myself.p  pAnd every year he charges us 500 to update this query to export the students for the current year. So when I discovered it was only a query .bat file and .sql file, my thought was I can update this myself. All I have to do is change the years in the query eg. 2009 to 2010.p  pThe query .sql file itself has this comment at the topp  precode This code was writtend by [the guy]  and is the property of [his company]...Copyright 2005,2006,2008,2009  This code MAY NOT BE USED without the expressed written consent of   [his company]. codepre  pYes, it really does says writtend.p  pSo now my boss is worried that were violating the copyright. And that the guy is gonna find out that I updated the query myself because we havent asked him to update it this year and take legal action.p  pSo back to the subjects question Can he really copyright this query And if so, is modifying it ourselves a copyright violation In my mind, a single query isnt program code. Its more a command line command. But I dont know what its considered legally.p

Negative 1531 pIve been thinking about starting a new project in C.NET 4.0RC for a couple of days now. The end result of the project would be a classlibrary consisting of what I for now call a ProviderFactory, a couple of interfaces or abstract classes and a default ProviderType or two.p  pFirst of all I might needdecide to change the naming of my classes not to clash with whats already in .NET. Secondly its a good chance that what Im describing here already exists it might even be within .NET natively without me knowing about it, so if thats the case a single link to that project or a tutorial would be appreciated.p  pThe functionality Im thinking about is not just a factory that can provide me with a simple Provider, but it should be able to generate any kind of Provider. I want to be able to write something like thisp  precodeBlogProvider bp  ProviderFactory.GetProviderltBlogProvidergt codepre  pand it should return the current selected BlogProvider, or null if there is none. Also I want to be able to provide a list over all the available providers of one type like for instancep  precodestring[] blogproviders  ProviderFactory.GetRegisteredProvidersltBlogProvidergt codepre  pand it should return an array of strings with blogproviders like ODBCBlogProvider, XMLBlogProvider, etc.. I also need to be able to set the current provider, for instance like thisp  precodeProviderFactory.SetCurrentProviderltBlogProvidergtODBCBlogProvider codepre  pThis should make the current BlogProvider the ODBCBlogProvider, so that next time I call ProviderFactory.GetProvider it should return an instance of ODBCBlogProvider which of cause need to extend the BlogProvider base class.p  pAlso, every ProviderType or ProviderBase if you like needs to have a ProviderTypeName BlogProvider and a ProviderTypeDisplayName Blog or Blog provider that is unique to that ProviderType, and every Provider that extends that provider needs to have a ProviderName ODBCBlogProvider and a ProviderDisplayName ODBC or ODBC blog etc.. The ProviderName and ProviderTypeName could just for simplicity be there classnames gained by reflection.p  pThis probably means that Id need an interface for the ProviderBase, something like thisp  precodepublic interface ProviderBase      string ProviderName  get   The displayname.     string Description  get   A description of the provider type, like This provides you with a blog.  codepre  pAnd for the BlogProvider Id need to create a abstract class that implements those two members and creates methods for the actual BlogProviders to override.p  precodepublic abstract class BlogProvider  ProviderBase      public string ProviderName              get  return Blog            public string Description              get  return This provides you with a blog.            public abstract int GetPostCount  codepre  pThen, somewhere in my code Id had to run something likep  precodeProviderFactory.RegisterProviderTypetypeofBlogProvider codepre  por an even better option would be to be able to use attributes like thisp  precode[ProviderBlog, This provides you with a blog.] public interface BlogProvider      int GetPostCount  codepre  pI dont see the need to use an abstract class with this approach because none of the members needs to be set in the base class. Also the need for the ProviderBaseinterface is gone. The ideal thing would of cause be if the ProviderFactory could just find all the classesinterfaces containing the ProviderAttribute, and than ODBCBlogProvider would just need to implement BlogProvider, but Im not certain how I do this, especially not when its a requirement that the providers and providertypes can both come for external assemblies.p  pAnother requirement of the ProviderFactory is that it should work both when in a stateless environment and in a environment where it is kept alive, thus it should be able to save settings to some configfilestreamdatabase something like that, doesnt really matter on change and load from this at initialization, but this should be optional. Thus it would also work on the web having a blog on your own machine doesnt give too much sense.p  pOne more requirement is that the Providers might emrequireem other Providers to work. For instance, and AudiEngine might only work with an AudiCar, however an AudiCar can run perfectly with an BmwEngine.p  pAlso and Im not sure where to put that yet, maybe an optional attribute on the providerclass itself every provider should have the option to be singleton or not.p  pThat is all I can think of for now.

Negative 1531 pWhen a GUI is composed of several subcomponents that I treat as individual Views with their own Presenter and Models, is there a pattern for gluing them together Some subcomponents are persistently on the screen while others would get swapped in and out.p  ol liWhat would be a good factory pattern for instantiating the respective MVP triad for a subcomponent that gets added to the GUI at runtimeli liHow do you glue the subcomponents with the persistent container part of the GUI and with each other Would there be a God Presenter that ties other presenters togetherli ol  pstrongUpdatestrong Im now shooting for something similar to Eclipses extension mechanism. Plugins register themselves to a global registry for the functionality that they provide. When a functionality such as returning data or rendering a View is needed, the registry is queried and the returned functions are invoked this is pure JavaScript, so Im not using interfaces. Im going with a pureplugin approach where everything even the main View is a plugin. I might also use an Event Bus to let the various Presenters communicate agnostically.p  pNow my more specific question becomes, when a plugin is about to contribute a View, how should I go about initializing the MVP triad and getting the View rendered into a parent container outside the module. I probably need to let the View render itself into a container passed from outside and inject the View and Model if needed into the Presenter. An alternative would be for the View to return a component that can be placed inside a container, but this would be against my tentative ideal of keeping everything that is GUIframeworkspecific inside View implementations. I prefer if the factoryglue mechanism can be frameworkagnostic.p  pOK Ill stop yammering now and wait for some feedback, and then perhaps add more clarifications on where exactly Im stuck...p

Negative 1531 pI am writing a simple multidrop RS485 protocol for serial communications within a distributed system.  I am using an addressable model where slave devices are given a window of 20ms to respond.  The master uC polls the connected devices for updates and they respond accordingly.  Ive employed checksums and take the necessary overrun precautions to ensure that connected devices will not respond to malformed messages.  This method has proved effective in approximately 99 of situations, but I lose the packet if a new device is introduced during a communication session.  Plugging in a new device hot will have negative effects on the signal being monitored by the slave devices, if only for an extremely short time.  Im on the software side of engineering, but how I can mitigate this situation without trying to recreate TCP  We use a polling model because it is fast and does the job well for our application, no need for RTOS functionality.

Negative 1531 pi wrote a command line program that shall clean and reorganize our archived server logs by piping line by line to new target files. Each target file has an according regEx filter item so if the line that is red from the sourcefile gets written to this specific target file if it matches the regEx.p  pI read the regEx strings and their target file strings from a config file and save these information in vectors to be able to dynamically resize them by one with every new tagetfilter pair that is red from the config.p  pThe following piece of code shows how I loop through all my source files and for every single of them I read line by line and for every line that could be red I cycle through all the filters defined in the config and if the regEx match the line I write this line to to ofstream.

Negative 1531 pReal easy one here guys. Best justification gets the win.p  pIm a computer science student at a school youve heard of, and have been programming for several years now about 8, so Ive written a fair few lines of code. But since Ive never really been distributing  source or binaries  nor doing team developing though Im sure I will, Ive never needed to learn source code management systems. I have a tremendously boring hierarchy of folders along the lines of codesrcprojectnamecode or codesrcclasscodehworprojectnamecode and if I need to send the code to a friend or for grading, its just a tarball away.p  pA few things have changed in recent years, as my projects have gotten bigger. My Mac, with Time Machine, now does hourly backups  this has saved me a fair few times, most recently when I made major changes over SSH... then saved and closed the stale copy in my editor a few hours later. p  pBut, out of a sort of professional interest  along with an overwhelming sense that it could be useful  Ive decided to learn SCMS. Now, I have plenty of experience as a source code consumer  codegit clonecode, codesvn checkoutcode, codecvs cocode, that sort of thing  but none as a maintainer, committer, or updater.p  pMy question to you is what should I learn Now, a bunch of you are screaming why one youll use many but Id like to learn the basics of SCM, and get in the habits of actually using it, on the most straightforward system. There are a number of concepts Id do well to internalize  branches, tags, merging, collaboration, etc  before I really need them.p  pTo be clear, Im no Linus Torvalds. I will be mantaining one, or perhaps a few branches. On my emdozensem of files, I dont mind if some operations take a few hundred ms more on one system than on others.p  pNow what do I have I do have a webhost. They offer Subversion hosting a click away, or I could store other repositories there no problem. For reasons I cant explain, Im rather partial to Subversion. But thats exactly why Im reluctant to just jump in. I know Mercurial, Git, and so forth are the hot new things, being distributed, but Im not sure why this is a benefit. In fact, Im not quite sure how it could work.p  pSo, what should I start with Subversion or Git Mercurial or CVS Visual Source Safe or Perforce that last pair was a joke And why one over the otherp  pThanks for your time, and if this in the wrong section I apologize.p  pstrongEDITstrong Thanks all I appreciate your comments. Given the choice between Git and Hg, Id probably go with Git  any disagreement Second, why emnotem Subversion It seems to be the consensus not just here that its old or otherwise obsolete. Whys thatp  pstrongEDIT 2strong So after reading all the responses and doing some more reading, Ive decided to go with Git. Answer goes to the best justification, as stated above. Git seems to be more popular than Mercurial, even if it is a bit less clean. Im pushing changes to my webserver, where I have a hrefhttpviewgit.sourceforge.net relnofollowviewgita installed, and its working great. The impetus for storing a copy on my webserver is that Id like to be working from several of my machines, and I expect them to get out of sync. I also expect to have the several working copies out of sync with each other and my server, and I now understand that Subversion is pretty weak at that. Theres a lot Im still trying to work out, but Ive got it set up now so that I can pullclone from http and push over ssh next step is to set up Gitosis. To a newbie looking to do what Im doing  youll find that your push commands will work the first time, but any cloned copies wont track the changes you make. Git considers this a safety feature... I only slightly understand why, but it has to do with merging. The trick is to use a hrefhttputsl.gen.nzgitpostupdate relnofollowthisa postupdate hook on the server to merge the newlypushed copy into the servers working copy.p

Negative 1531 pI am writing an Eclipse plugin and one of the classes implements IWindowListener. As a result, I have a few methods that must be in my class including windowOpenedIWorkbenchWindow window. My understanding of the windowOpened method is that it should be called when the Eclipse Application is launched and the plugin starts, however I have included some log statements in this method and it never gets called.p  pDoes anyone know why this is happening Has anyone experienced a similar issuep  pIt should be noted that the other IWindowListener methods seem to work fine. For instance, the windowClosed method is properly called when I exit the Eclipse Application that the plugin is running in.p

Negative 1531 pi am running an third party RMIServer app providing exactly one method codegetImage returns an image as byte[].code The implementation of this method getting the image via a SOAPWS is provide by me.p  pThe problem on running this RMIServer is the high CPU consumption measured with jvisualvm 65 of cpu time go into codesun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPTransportConnectionHandler.runcode and on second place with 15 is codesun.net.www.http.KeepAliveCache.runcode. The real work scaling the image comes on 4th place. The server is running on win 2003 server. i guess there is something wrong with resourceconnection handling but is this an implementation problem or a windows configurationproblemp  panother observation is if cpu utilization is high the memory utilization goes also up  the question is is this because the gc cant do its work or many images waiting to be delivered. all i can say the memoryis used for codebyte[]code.p  pso any ideas what to dop  pthx in advancep

Negative 1531 pI discovered that the existence and use of metaclasses can save you from a lot codewriting by providing an elegant handle on the process of class creation. I use this in my application, where several interacting servers are instantiated. To elaboratep  pEach device instantiates a server class specific to its operation, which is a subclass of a subclass of... ulitmately this one codeBaseServercode class. Now, some device servers need a codeThreadedTCPservercode, and some need a codeSimpleTCPServercode module codesocketservercode. They cannot all derive from the same class because using the codeThreadingMixincode overrides the behavior of the codeSimpleTCPServercode.p  pTo handle this dynamic class configuration, I created a codeMetaServerTypecode, which chooses the baseclasses for BaseServer as codeSimpleTCPServer,code or as codeThreadedTCPServer,code  producing my desired result of dynamically configured server classes Woo hoop  pNow, here comes my question I would like to use a configuration file where parameters are stored, and these parameters are used by default by the MetaServerType. For example config.defaultloglevel, or config.defaulthandler etc. And individual servers can be overriden from commandline or otherwise according to the metaclass specifications.p  pIt is good design practice to have only ONE INSTANCE of the configuration object being passed through the programflow. One way to have this is to initialize the config object in the classbody of the metaclass  but my programflow begins elsewhere, and this means that the metaclass is called several times thus producing various instances of config. It appears that metaclass is called at import time p  pSo a detailed answer would be very welcome top  ol liHow can one supply metaclasses with configuration infoli liWhat is a good way to have a SINGLE config instance be passed through the programflow, to be edited, updated and perhaps eventually writtenli liCan the input arguments to metaclass be somehow extended beyond the Metaclass.strongnewstrongmeta, name, bases, attrs  ol liBonus question Does this move us one step closer to a finitestate machine of servers so that the state not the instances can be paused or resumedli olli ol  pCheers for the answersp

Negative 1531 pSo I have a project where Im trying to optimize a fairly complex Javascript function to the max  partly this is due to the fact that its supposed to run on smartphones Webkit and every little bit counts.p  pIve been using various debugging and timing techniques to go through my code and rewrite everything that might be slow  like parts of jQuery based stuff where native might do better and so on. What the function does is basically take a string of html text and cut it up to fit exactly into 3 DIVs that do not have fixed position or size a client templating mechanism. p  pAt the moment the entire function takes around 100ms to execute in iPads browser but in the production environment I need to ideally execute it 200 times and the problem is that out of those 100ms at least 20ms are because of this single line of code in 3 loopsp  precodevar maxTop  cur.offset.top  cur.outerHeight codepre  pcur is just a reference to a container DIV element and the line above is calculating its bottom position so where my text should break. From looking at the offset jQuery code I understand it uses getBoundingClientRect and even eliminating jQuery offsetsizing and calling it directly does nothing to speed it up  so its getBoundingClientRect fault at least in Webkit. I did a bit of research on it and I understand it causes layout redraw.p  pBut still  cant believe that I do multiple DOM clearsclonesappends and all of those are much faster than a simple element position lookup Any ideas out there Maybe something webkit specific Or something that doesnt cause redrawp  pWould much appreciate itp

Negative 1531 pI am new to device driver programming. Ive followed the available tutorials on the web which has provided helpful information to get started. However now I have embarked on a new project where the exclusive goal is to search for functions which have been hooked by malware or keyloggers. So I think I have sorted out what I need to accomplish this though I still need to be able to locate the load address of the system dlls i.e. kernel32.dll, user32.dll and the like that are already loaded in memory. I need the load address so that I can parse their PE to get to the export and import sections. Furthermore adding the load address to the file size will give me a address range to cross reference the addresses of the export functions no  Cross referencing the the IMPORT address will be a little more involved but it can be done according to my estimates. I thought that building a kernel mode driver would be the right way to go since accessing memory outside the kernel drivers address range would not be an issue for the driver as opposed to a user mode app. How else will I be able to access the addresses located in the EAT and IAT of the target dll  I know there exist a user mode API that can provide the load address mainly being GetModuleHandle but I would like to find the equivalent in kernel mode. I could write a user mode application that could relay this information to the driver but prefer that this all be done in kernel mode if possible. Any suggestions or comments would be most welcome.p  pThanks in advancep  pVictorp  pp.s This post has been edited for more clarity. Hopefully it will make it more clear as what I am trying to accomplish.p

I am parsing this file just fine but the company added a new wrinkle.p  pThis line can be for a pilot or a flight attendant.  Until recently each line could be for a captain or First Officer. But now some files have captain lines and first officer lines.  The flight attendant file could have 1 or two flight attendant positions or more depending on the type of aircraft flown.p  pI need to create a new column in my database that reflects this new information.  Once the lines are saved to the database, they are only searched, never updated again.  I dont want to add a new table just to keep track of this information.  I want to add a new column to the existing table.  Here is my strategy.p  pWhen I parse the text file, I will keep track of the positions available.  If it is for Captain, I will save CA to the database. If it is first officer, I will save FO. If it is for both a captain and First officer, I will save CAFO. For flight attendants I will save a number 1 for 1 flight attendant poistion. For each additional poistion, I will just increment it one number. This would allow for expansion later if larger aiplanes required more flight attendant poistions.p  pSo to recap, I will save one the following for each database record.p  ul liCAFOli liCAli liFOli li1li li2li ul  pNow I will need to access the database and retrieve these records for my web program. If a captain wants to retreive records He will want only captain lines which would be CAFO or CA. And just the opposite for first officers. When I do the query, I found that I could use the mySQL command SUBSTRING to just grab the first 2 or last 2 characters.p  pfor captain linesp  blockquote   pSELECT codeLinenumbercode,codehtmltextcode FROM codelinescode WHERE SUBSTRINGcodeCrewtypecode,1,2CAp blockquote  pThis would just get the first two beginning characters from the record and it would match both cases. For First officers I start at the end of the string and grab last two characters.p  blockquote   pSELECT codeLinenumbercode,codehtmltextcode FROM codelinescode WHERE SUBSTRINGcodeCrewtypecode,2FOp blockquote  pFor flight attendants I could compare the number. If a flight attendant only wanted lines with 1 position.p  blockquote   pSELECT codeLinenumbercode,codehtmltextcode FROM codelinescode WHERE Crewtype  1p blockquote  pOr if they want all possible flight attendant positionsp  blockquote   pSELECT codeLinenumbercode,codehtmltextcode FROM codelinescode WHERE Crewtype  1p blockquote  pI would set the column type to ENUM with the values I listed above.  p  pMy question is there a better way to approach this problem  I will only be inserting once, but will be retreiving a lot.  Will the SUBSTRING command slow down the queries too muchp

Negative 1531 pI have a bit of a strange question. First let me tell you i cannot change the way the database is made. Some people before me made a really good job of messing some things up pretty bad.p  pIts a news site and there are editors in that can edit the news posts that others post. also editors can post news them self.p  pNow the question.p  precodeI have a table for news.  id     newsusername    who post news   newstext Table  newsid    username    newstext     Here user can be editor of the news or a person who  posted news  User Table  username   title  codepre  pIn that table there is a news id and a news username. The username being the username of the user posting the news. there are also allot more fields inside the table but they are not important.p  pThen there is a table newstext and within it the text for the news is placed. This table has a newsid and username field. This time the username is the field of the person who posted the news OR the username of the user that edited the post.p  pThen i have a user table with also a username field and a title field with the title for the user. In this p  pHope your still with me.p  pIn short if a user posts a news article the text will be inside the newstext table and when an editor edits the post the altered text will be inserted as a new text for the same article. This is done to let the original poster see what was altered to his post.p  pnow comes my challenge. I need to figure out how i can get the number of edits that an editor made. BUT because the editor itself can post news that means that i need to search for all news where the username is not equal to the original poster and where it is look for duplicates in the newstext table to see of the editor has edited his own post.p  pi really hope people understand a little of what i need to do. hope you can help me.p  hr  pin the comment  Marcus Adams pointed me at the how the latest edit was used on the website.p  pThis is don through a datetime field. When an edit is placed the edit will be inserted into the newstext field and there will be datetime stamp for the new edit. And with that it will determine witch text to grab for the news item.p  phope this is clearp

The problem I am facing for the neural network to learn a pothole is the fact that what data should I feed to the Back Propagation Neural Network  Shall I set a threshold and when the Y axis reaches this point, get the 5 previous points and 5 points after and then feed the network with 11 inputs I dont want to overtrain the network nor feed it with data in different positions each time.  p  pTraining  I am also starting to gather the data collected and create a training dataset  should I put things such as readings for normalbumpy roadsspeed bumps as well as potholes  How large should a training set be or is the more data the better it is actually true p  pThis is how the pothole data looks like.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4cSzt.png altPothole Graphp  pThis is how the speedbump data looks like.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7BLjq.png altSpeed Bumpp  pA sample of data collected p  precode XAxis     YAxis    ZAxis   Timestamp  0.371827, 8.513097, 5.441484, 165401 0.601749, 7.976613, 5.326523, 165601 0.333506, 8.053253, 5.441484, 165801 0.256866, 8.206534, 5.364844, 166001 0.049697, 8.398136, 5.364844, 166202 0.371827, 8.436457, 5.211563, 166400 0.256866, 8.551417, 5.709726, 166601 0.256866, 8.513097, 5.403164, 166801 0.333506, 8.474776, 5.709726, 167000 0.563428, 8.628057, 5.594766, 167201 0.563428, 7.401808, 4.713398, 167402 1.981280, 5.447472, 4.406836, 167602    POTHOLE 0.180225, 5.600753, 5.403164, 167800    POTHOLE 0.984952, 8.053253, 4.445156, 168001 1.214874, 8.666378, 5.671406, 168201 0.525108, 7.210207, 3.870352, 168401 1.138233, 7.286847, 5.824687, 168600 0.601749, 10.045910, 5.288203, 168801 0.180225, 8.206534, 5.173242, 169001 0.279619, 7.861651, 5.518125, 169200 0.202978, 8.934620, 5.824687, 169401 0.065264, 8.321495, 5.364844, 169601 0.065264, 8.628057, 5.709726, 169800 0.716710, 8.014933, 5.748047, 170001 0.141905, 8.513097, 5.441484, 170200 0.026944, 8.206534, 5.594766, 170401 0.601749, 8.168214, 5.058281, 170601 codepre  pstrongAlgorithmstrongp  pMy proposed algorithm is to set a certain threshold such as strongline 12strong on the sample data when the Y axis hits a certain threshold such as stronglt7strong then pass the previous 5 points and the 5 points after that to the NN.p

It will follow the player in an open space but hits a snag when trying to trace around an object.p  pSo when my algorithm is checking and moving in a direction of lowest F value, it might come across a dead end, and at this point it needs to retrace its steps backwards, but it cant because my code tells it that a previously checked node is closed and cant be moved to, and therefore it gets stuck.p  pHow do I recalculate a closed node to tell my algorithm that it is ok to go back that way.p  pAlso, if I do tell my algorithm to go back on its self, what is to stop it from going back AGAIN to the better node it just came from effectively going back between two nodes repeatedly.p  pI see that it should be able to check a node in the closed list and determine if it is better on this particular path, but Im not sure how that is done.p  pThe heuristics Im using.p  precodeG  Math.AbsStartNodeX  TargetNodeX  Math.AbsStartNodeY  TargetNodeY  H  Math.AbsCurrentNodeX  TargetNodeX  Math.AbsCurrentNodeY  CurrentNodeY  F  G  H codepre  pPsuedocode.p  ol liAdd all adjacent nodes to the Open Listli liCheck all those nodes for lowest F score and add that node to the Best Path Listli liAdd all checked nodes to the Closed List theyve all been checked, dont want to check them againli liRepeat until target is reachedli liMove enemy 1 node in the direction of the best pathli liRepeat all over againli ol

Negative 1531 pOK so this is quite a hard one to explain but I will do my best.p  pI have a table that contains information related to some customer hardware, some of this hardware is going to be subjected to scheduled monitoring, some every 24hrs and some at even shorter intervals 515minp  pThis monitoring is going to be done using some scheduled scripts and requires some totaling from another table which gathers data on the device. p  pWhat I am trying to figure out is, would I be better off just have the script scan through the entire tablep  precodeif 24hr enabled     execute 24hr script if instant enabled     execute instant script codepre  por would I be better off running a script that separates the hardware into 2 tablesp  ul li24hr enabled devices li liinstant enabled devicesli ul  pThis would mean that the scheduled job would have less work to do, basically operate checks on every device in the table and finish.p  pThis breaks normalisation rules as I would have duplicate data in certain tables, but as the tables are only populated from the source table I was thinking this might not be an issue. p  pObviously I am quite unsure and this is the first time I have had to deal with such a complex system.p  pAs example my table currently looks like with addition of naming and setup data  p  ul lideviceidli lialarmhighvalueli lialarmlowvalueli lienablealarmdayli lienableinstantalarmsli ul  pIm not sure if I have given enough information to help, so if anyone has any more questions please ask.

Negative 1531 pI have been designing a custom splash screen using the following approachp  ul liI have one splash creen controller thats been defined as a rootview controller in storyboard.li liThe splash screen controller is taking care of making a screenshot of itself and a custom container controller i would like to segue to. When the screenshots have all been taken care of, I allow the user to segue to the container controller by doing a custom modal segue. li ul  pI think there are 2 problems with this approachp  ol liThe splash screen controller is still in memory even when i dont need it anymore.li liI am loading the view for the first controller contains within my custom container controller 2 times one when i am making a screenshot of the container controller and an other one when i am presenting modally the containerview controller.li ol  pWould it possible using storyboard to present modally the splashscreen just before the view for the container controller has even loaded Can i have a custom segue when the splashscreen is being dismissedp

Negative 1531 pWe have a getter method within a class.  Within the same JAR we want the variable to be accessible with the noidentifier access level, from the same package and subpackages.p  pBelow the access levels from a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavajavaOOaccesscontrol.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavajavaOOaccesscontrol.htmlap  pOur problem is, how do we stop someone from taking the compiled .JAR, creating a class with the same package namespace definition, and being able to access our variable through the getterp  pWe thought about getting rid of all getters for the specific variable, and giving the variable value to other classes with setters and constructors, when they pass a reference to themselves. Obviously, they will be final classes. This way all objects needing the variable value have their own private copy.p  pIm wondering though if there is a better wayp

Negative 1531 pcodeHttpClientcode has a builtin timeout feature despite being all asynchronous, i.e. timeouts could be considered orthogonal to the http request functionality and thus be handled by generic asynchronous utilities, but that aside and when the timeout kicks in, itll throw a codeTaskCanceledExceptioncode wrapped in an codeAggregateExceptioncode.p  pThe TCE contains a codeCancellationTokencode that equals codeCancellationToken.Nonecode.p  pNow if I provide codeHttpClientcode with a codeCancellationTokencode of my own and use that to cancel the operation before it finishes or times out, I get the exact same codeTaskCanceledExceptioncode, again with a codeCancellationToken.Nonecode.p  pIs there still a way, strongby looking only at the exception thrownstrong, to figure out whether a timeout canceled the request, without having to make my own codeCancellationTokencode accessible to the code that checks the exceptionp  pP.S.

Negative 1531 pI am implementing an up button in a music player app. The player activity for this app can have numerous points of entry multiple tracklists in different activities. I am trying to figure out how to implement the up button pattern correctly. According to the docsp  blockquote   pNavigating to screens with multiple entry pointsp      pSometimes a screen doesnt have a strict position within the apps hierarchy, and can be reached from multiple entry pointssuch as a settings screen that can be reached from any other screen in your app. In this case, the Up button should choose to return to the referring screen, behaving identically to Back.p blockquote  pThat makes sense, under normal usage, I would just call onBackPressed or even finish. But there is one case I dont know how to handle. Playback occurs in a service with a notification. If the user backs out of the app while something is playing, heshe can click on the notification to go directly to the player. p  pAt this point, the player would be the only thing in the stack, so I am not sure the best way to proceed when the user clicks up. Ideally, I would like to pick a default landing page home page to navigate to. I am unsure how to know where to send the user without looking at the backstack though, and there seems like there should be something easier.p  pSo I am looking for a way for this sequencep  precode user is in player activity and presses up  if the entry point to the player is still on the backstack, I finish to go back to the referring activity  if the entry point is not on the backstack, I go to the home page codepre  pDoes this sound right, and further is there any easy way to implement thisp

Negative 1531 pI have an application using MVVM pattern. There are some commands implemented using CommandReference and DelegateCommand classes. Thay are binded in the MainWindow InputBindings to some hotkeys. For example     KeyBinding KeyW CommandStaticResource WireframeCommandReferencep  pAnd then I have a Properties window which displays some objects properties. Some of those properties are of type string and they are edited shown in TextBox. And here I got a problem. When I try to type w in the TextBox, nothing is typed but the command WireframeCommand is fired.  What I want, is to be able to edit a property without firing any commands if a TextBox is active, else to fire a command. Any helpp
Negative 1531 pIm searching the best way to render a part of a view, depending on the loaded modules when the view is called for rendering.

I mean, trigger an event from my menu template to my module template in order to display it only if the module is started. Any ideas p

Negative 1531 pOk, so this question is with regard to the use of Dynamic and Static Sets in Analysis Server. It is my understanding that Static Sets are evaluated during the processing of the Cube and dont regard any conditions specified in the WHERE slicer in MDX. Whereas Dynamic Sets are evaluated during the time of Query execution.p  pI have a cube that has an extremely large number of customer Claim numbers in a Dimension. If my clients wanted to view any number of Measures associated with these Claim Numbers but wanted to look at a range, theyd have to filter a good number of the Claim Numbers.p  pTo alleviate this, I created a Dynamic Set that does nothing more than group several thousand of the numbers into a group that they may use. The problem is that Ive seen a great degradation of performance using the Dynamic Sets so I am thinking that a Static Set may suffice for this type of scenario.p  pSo will a Static Set suffice if it is just a set of Dimension members with no calculations contained in itp

Negative 1531 pIve just finished a small web project using Twitter Bootstrap and Wordpress, but unfortunately Internet Explorer has some problems with it. Opera, Safari and Chrome display the page without errors.p  pIn IE10 amp IE9 everything looks good, but IE8 amp IE7 only display a white page. I already did a Google search to find a solution for that White Screen of Death WSOD, but I was let down.p  pI also did some debugging on the page itself. That way I found out that a polyfill for HTML5 forms was causing the problem. I am using a hrefhttpafarkas.github.comwebshimdemos relnofollowWebshimsa for that. On the page it states IE6 compatibility, but as you can see this is not the case, which is strange.p  pSo I looked into the FireBug console to see if there are any JavaScript errors. There werent any errors, but there was a warning, located in the script that causes troublep  pcodeCall webshims.polyfill before DOMReady or set waitReady to false.codep  pSo I took a look into the documentation and set codewaitReadycode to codefalsecode because I load the script at the bottom of the page. As a result, the warning was gone  but IE8 amp IE7 still only display a white page As a test I again removed the call to the script, the page works in IE8 amp 7. As soon as I add the call again  white page.p  pAfter hours of being puzzled, one thing came to my mind As a default, jQuery in Wordpress runs in no conflict mode, meaning instead of writing codesomethingcode you have to write codejQuerysomethingcode. My idea was that this could cause some problems, so I deactivated the no conflict mode. Still Nothing, white page.p  pI dont have any more ideas what could cause the problem, so I am asking you Did you ever encounter that problem Do you have any solutions or ideas for solutionsp  pAny input is really appreciatedp

The file changed because there is a server modifying the content as it runs, this shouldnt be an issue to the overall backup because, being they are the region files from a Minecraft server, the files can be used seperately from each other. My main concern is, is it skipping the files, or redoing them If it is skipping the files, this could be a MAJOR loophole in the backup, because a player with malicious intent could purposely modify the region while it is backing up, preventing it from backing up. So if it is skipping the file, how can I repeat it without having to redo the entire backupp  pOn the third message, it states that it can not access the file emhomecluckyMinecraftServers.backupsBackup08January20131531.tar.gzem, however, as you can clearly see in the window below it, the file does exist.

Negative 1531 pI am using struts1.2 and junit 3. In order to test my action classes, I need to create HttpServletRequest objects. p  pNow Struts 1.2 has does not provide a way to create mock objects of HTTPServletRequest.

Negative 1531 pIve been spending a little time trying to see how bare bones an Eclipse install I could get. Ive found that the available packages tend to have things that I dont really need, and since eclipse is all about plugins, I figure that I can just start with a minimal set and install needed ones as I go.p  pTo that end, I downloaded the platform runtime binary from a hrefhttpdownload.eclipse.orgeclipsedownloadsdrops4R4.2.1201209141800 relnofollowhttpdownload.eclipse.orgeclipsedownloadsdrops4R4.2.1201209141800a and started experimenting. My usual plugins installed fine, but Ive run into a few annoyances in installing language plugins. Namely, they all seem to depend on the JDT plugin somehow. Installing Pydev from their update site pulls in JDT, along with a bunch of other cruft without explicitely depending on it, while trying to install PDT, from either the Juno repository or the PDT update site simply fails until I install the JDT.p  pIs there any way to install such plugins without JDT, eclipse being eclipse and all Am I going about this completely wrong Any advice appreciated.p

Negative 1531 pIm creating my GUI for my RCP application using a codeGridLayoutcode but Im coming across problems because from what I understand a codeGridLayoutcode adds elements in the order you create themset their layout data So, this doesnt offer a lotany flexibility for moving elements around and adding new elements whilst keeping the same layout of previously placed elements.p  pIs there any other approach I should be using to make my GUI I need it to be flexible and easy to specify the size and location of individual components rather than the component going in the next space. p  pAt the momentcodeGridLayoutcode only allows me to specify the number of columns on the screen then specify the elements attributes codeSWT.LEFT, SWT.CENTERcode etc. p  pHeres my code to show what I meanp  precodeimport javax.annotation.PostConstruct import org.eclipse.swt. import org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridData import org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridLayout import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Text  public class CreateUI   Text area for the variables Text variableArea Text methodArea Text otherArea Text fooArea  PostConstruct Annotation indicates the method is to be called after the class is constructed public void createInterfaceComposite parent      int columns 4      Set the layout of the parent the Part to a grid layout     parent.setLayoutnew GridLayoutcolumns, true      variableArea  new Textparent, SWT.BORDER  SWT.VSCROLL  SWT.HSCROLL     variableArea.setTextHello     variableArea.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.LEFT, SWT.CENTER, true, true, 1, 1      methodArea  new Textparent, SWT.BORDER  SWT.VSCROLL  SWT.HSCROLL     methodArea.setTextHello2     methodArea.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.LEFT, SWT.CENTER, true, true, 1, 1      otherArea  new Textparent, SWT.BORDER  SWT.VSCROLL  SWT.HSCROLL     otherArea.setTextHello3     otherArea.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.LEFT, SWT.CENTER, true, true, 1, 1      fooArea  new Textparent, SWT.BORDER  SWT.VSCROLL  SWT.HSCROLL     fooArea.setTextHello4     fooArea.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.LEFT, SWT.CENTER, true, true, 1, 1       codepre  pThis produces thisp  pa hrefhttpimgur.comJHJ4hic relnofollowimg srchttpi.imgur.comJHJ4hic.png alt titleHosted by imgur.com ap  pAt the moment theres only those 4 Text areas there as an example but Im going to have multiple Text areas, Buttons, Drop Down Menus etc later on and I want to be able to format them easier and position them freely.p  pIn relation to the above example I want to be able to position those 4 Text areas on top of one another in a column to display information and have other elements positioned freely in the remaining space.p  pAny pointers would be great for what I should be using.p

Do it make the difference of the packet sending speed p  pstrongEDIT2strongp  pThis time,I use ifconfig to find the TX packets count difference between before and after running codehping3code and codepackETHclicode.  And found that the packets generating rates are close for the two tools. codehping3code is about 100000 packets per seconds and codepackETHclicode is about 80000 packets per seconds. p  pI also use codevnstatcode to measure the packets generating rates. And the result is consistent with the number I get from codeifconfigcode.p  pSo, it seems that codeiptrafcode lies. And I use codeiptrafcode to monitor the repeated resending of a TCP packet, without update the IP ID number and TCP sequence number. codeiptrafcode think my packet sending rate is 0 packets per seconds. May be codeiptrafcode dont count the duplicated packetsp

Any ideas what is causing this or how to fix it  Thanks for any help on thisp  precode0130528 070123.394 myapp[2510014003]  set USER center 20130528 070123.394 myapp[2510014003] spanVal lt0.300000gt 20130528 070123.503 myapp[2510014003] [CALayer prepareKeyForNewAnimation] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x85781e0 20130528 070123.504 myapp[2510014003]  Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason [CALayer prepareKeyForNewAnimation] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x85781e0  First throw call stack 0x1ec7012 0x1c3ae7e 0x1f524bd 0x1eb6bbc 0x1eb694e 0x55e9b 0x248053f 0x2492014 0x24827d5 0x1e6daf5 0x1e6cf44 0x1e6ce1b 0x2efe7e3 0x2efe668 0xb7effc 0x2042 0x1f75 libcabi.dylib terminate called throwing an exception   backtrace  thread 1 tid  0x1f03, 0x9bca39c6 libsystemkernel.dylibpthreadkill  10, stop reason  signal SIGABRT     frame 0 0x9bca39c6 libsystemkernel.dylibpthreadkill  10     frame 1 0x90065f78 libsystemc.dylibpthreadkill  106     frame 2 0x0250157b libsystemsimc.dylibabort  140     frame 3 0x02413f7b libcabi.dylibabortmessage  105     frame 4 0x02411a25 libcabi.dylibdefaultterminate  34     frame 5 0x01c3b0c1 libobjc.A.dylibobjcterminate  94     frame 6 0x02393652 libstdc.6.0.9.dylibstdterminate  21     frame 7 0x01c3b039 libobjc.A.dylibobjcterminate  11     frame 8 0x02492027 libdispatch.dylibdispatchclientcallout  33     frame 9 0x024827d5 libdispatch.dylibdispatchmainqueuecallback4CF  296     frame 10 0x01e6daf5 CoreFoundationCFRunLoopRun  1925     frame 11 0x01e6cf44 CoreFoundationCFRunLoopRunSpecific  276     frame 12 0x01e6ce1b CoreFoundationCFRunLoopRunInMode  123     frame 13 0x02efe7e3 GraphicsServicesGSEventRunModal  88     frame 14 0x02efe668 GraphicsServicesGSEventRun  104     frame 15 0x00b7effc UIKitUIApplicationMain  1211     frame 16 0x00002042 myappmainargc1, argv0xbffff364  130 at main.m16     frame 17 0x00001f75 myappstart  53 codepre  p[EDIT] Very bizarre.

Negative 1531 pIm working on an application which uses a serial connection to a USB device Shows up as a COM port. On the previous HW, a silabs chip was used and silabs drivers was installed on the PC. The new HW uses a internal USB block and now has a custom driver.p  pWhen I useused the old HW, I would get a exception in my reader thread in the read call, when the USB device was disconnected, but with the new setup this is not the case. I have been looking at the drivers and where silabs depends on its own .sys files, the new driver uses usbser.sys. I have been reading alot about the different sections in a INF files, assuming that this was related to a driver problem but can not seem to find any thing which pops in my eyes.p  pThe application is written in Java and uses the jComport component. Sadly Im not allowed to post any driver code, but hope you guys can help me anyway.p  pAnyone which can pass on some information to help me p

Negative 1531 pI have a native C application that exposes a COM interface with a number of events plugins subscribe to a subset of these events. Ive added support for CLR hosting in the application and written a custom hostappdomainmanager interface that loads a C loader assembly which inherits from AppDomainManager loosely based on example at a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles416471CLRHostingCustomizingtheCLR relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles416471CLRHostingCustomizingtheCLRa which is working properly to load managed plugins for my application. The issue Im working on now is that Id like to be able to hookup the application events to managed plugin callback functions via the loader dynamically I want to iterate through every event that the application exposes via the COM interface, find a matching function nameparams in the plugin, and attach the eventhandler. On the managed plugin side, this is possible via the Reflection APIs iterating through the plugin assembly and checking typesmethods, but Im wondering if its possible to get a collection of the events exposed via the COM interface from the unmanaged side. Im using the special tlbimp eventdelegate types to hook up the event handlers statically nowp  precodeappInterface.Function  new IApplicationEventsFunctionEventHandlerFunction codepre  pIs there any way I can get around explicitly hooking up each event handler this way or am I stuck What Im wondering is if theres some way to iterate through the special delegate types created via the interop and grab the same kind of nameparam info that is available via the Reflection API for managed classes.p
Negative 1531 pI am using a codetab bar controllercode in conjunction with codecore datacode.

Negative 1531 pI am using actionbarsherlocks ActionBar, the first time you run the application in landscape or horizontal orientation the tabs is displayed in codeTabs Modecode. After changing the orientation to portrait the nav mode is still in codeTabscode. The second time changing the orientation to codehorizontalcode the tabs are displayed as a codeListcode and only the parent item is displayed and the rest are hidden. I heard that this is a bug to Android, the system automatically changes the nav mode to codelistcode if the tabs are too many to fit the screen. But the thing is the first time I load the application is it displayed as codetabscode mode even horizontally. By the way I created strong100 tabsstrong.p  pemThis image is in horizontal view.

Negative 1531 pIm building a web app that has multiple panoramas built with Pano2VR, which is basically a software that can spit out a textured WebGL cubic panoramas in a canvas tag.  I want to put about 11 of these on a single page so that when the user requests one, the browser doesnt have to load a separate page. I just have to unhide it and bring it to the front.p  pThe problem is, when I put more than 9 of these panoramas which are WebGL canvases on a single page, some of the canvases go blank.  Im guessing this is a memory issue.  This app is running locally, so all the assets are local not downloaded or anything.  Im not doing any sort of preloading, so Im wondering if that might fix it.  Ive never worked with preloading or anything, so Im not sure if it would even help.p  pHas anyone ever dealt with having multiple canvas tags or multiple WebGL canvas tags on a page and having some go blank If anyone has any ideas, Im all ears.p

Negative 1531 pWe are building a search form for users to search our database, the form will contain mulitlpe fields which are all optional.  Fields includingp  ol licompany nameli licompany codeli libusiness type service or productli liProduct or Serviceli liProduct or Service subtype  this will depend on what is chosen in 4li ol  pBasically the users can fill all or just some of the fields and submit the form.  How best should we handle the sql for this  Is it best to use dynamic sql, build out the where clause in our webpage and then forward that to the sql stored procedure to use as its where clause  Or is it better to pass all the values to the stored procedure and let it build the where clause dynamically.  Also is dynamic sql the only way  I wasnt sure if using EXECUTESQLStatement is a good practice.p

Negative 1531 pI just started using eclim combined with YouCompleteMe, and its great.  There is one thing thats bothering me, though, and I cant figure out how to fix it.  The syntax checker runs on file saves, which is good, but it shows TODOs in the file as errors.  So, in the error column on the left side of the window, an error appears when theres a TODO in the file.  Ive searched through all of eclims vim files, tried a couple of eclim settings codegEclimTodoSearchPatterncode and codegEclimTodoSearchExtensionscode, and none of those fixed the problem.  Indeed, it seems like eclims codeProjectTodocode and codeTodocode commands arent whats causing this, because they produce a different kind of error and location list different colors.p  pIm thinking that eclim gets a list of issues from eclipse, including eclipses task tags which in turn are automatically generated from any TODO text, and thats what it shows.  So I tried to find a way to get eclipse not to show the task tag, but that was also unsuccessful.  I can get task tags to not show up in the Tasks view in eclipse, but I cant get them to be removed from the file itself.  Any idea of what I can do here  I would really like to be able to see a real syntax error with eclim, fix it, and see the left error bar go away, so that I know I dont have any more compilation errors.  I dont want a TODO to pretend that its a compilation error.p

Negative 1531 pstrongTASKstrongp  pI am currently trying to work out a viable structure for a simple application for the costing of jobs. I have decided to create one table to house all the operations and then link the operation together via a ParentID field. Below is a simplified structure of this tablep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8bU7B.png altSimplified structure of my DB tablep  pAs you can see, the primary key is an integer field that does auto increment to keep it unique. Any operations that stem off another operation will have it under the parent ID field to create a simplistic breakdown of work flow. Also on this data table is a field for costs, this is a field that I am most interested in. p  pstrongTHE PROBLEMstrongp  pI would like  to run a query where I could throw in an operation ID and it would recursively run through that operation AND all of its children and its childrens children etc. This would then accumulate all of the cost fields in the records that it retrieves. The only way I can think to do this is through recursive loops which in my opinion are not the best way to do this.p  pstrongTHE QUESTIONstrongp  pSo, my question is, is there a way to do this without recursive loops If there is not, can anyone suggest the cleanest and quickest way with the loopsp
Negative 1531 pI am currently working on a project where I have to program the same tool both in Matlab and R and compare both software options. I started in R and now I am translating the code to Matlab but I am now stuck at the most important part. The output file that the tool creates after doing the analysis. Basically, my tool makes an analysis that loops codencode times, and after each loop I get many variables that go into an output table. So, to be more clear, after each loop I get variablesp  precodeA  123  B  456  C  string1  D  string2  E  789 codepre  pThe values in each variable change after each loop, I just want to make clear that the variables are both numeric and string values since this is what causes my problem.p  pIn codeRcode what I do after each loop isp  precodeoutp lt cbindA,B,C,D,E codepre  pand create a data frame containing each variable in one cell arranged horizontally to afterwards add the result of each loop vertically in a new data framep  precodeoutp2 lt rbindoutp2,outp codepre  pso in the end I get a data frame codeoutp2code with A,B,C,D,E columns and codencode rows containing the values of each variable after each loop. So at the end of the looping process I can use codewrite.csvcode function and create an output file of codeoutp2code that contains both numeric and string columns.p  pI tried to do this in Matlab but I cannot find a function that can join the data in the same way I am doing it in R because using brackets code[]code only allows me to join numeric kind of variables. So basically my question is How can I replicate what I am doing in R in Matlabp  pI hope I was clear enough, I found it a bit hard to explain.p

Negative 1531 pstrongSummary TLDR versionstrongp  pUltimately our goal is to be able to utilize OpenGL ES code in a WPF application natively i.e. not SharpGL, etc. and without Airspace or driver issues, possible using Googles ANGLE project.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pOne of the things I like about OpenGL over DirectX is its crossplatform capability.  It has excellent support on both OS X and Linux, and also on Android and iOS via ES.  However, on Windows, using it is marred with driver issues, or worse, a lot of cards simply dont implement it properly.p  pEnter Googles a hrefhttpscode.google.compangleproject relnofollowANGLE projecta, or AlmostNativeGraphicsLayerEngine.p  pANGLE is an OpenGL ES 2.0 wrapper around a Direct3D implementation, meaning you can write OpenGL ES 2.0 code to be run on Windows without the need for actual OpenGL drivers. It not only passes the ES compatibility tests, but its actually how Chrome does all of its graphics rendering, including WebGL so it definitely is a proven technology.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pWe know WPF has a D3DImage control which lets you host Direct3D rendering within WPF and it supposedly does away with the airspace issues by properly composting its output to the WPF render thread.  My question is since ANGLE is implemented via Direct3D, and D3DImage is a target for Direct3D rendering, is it possible to combine the two, allowing us to write OpenGL ES code and host it in a WPF application on Windows, all without driver or airspace issuesp  pThis would be the Holy Grail for us.p  pHowever, I keep hitting a wall around getting ANGLE to target its rendering on the D3D surface created by the D3DImage control since ANGLE wants to use its own.  Im not sure this is even possible.  I cant find a single article or reference anywhere of anyone even discussing this, let alone attempting it.p  pAgain to be clear though, the goal is to get our shared, crossplatform OpenGL or ES code to work in a WPF application without airspace issues or OpenGL driver requirements.  My suggestion of using ANGLED3DImage is just that... an attempt. Its the means Ive come up with so far, but thats just a potential means to our goal, not the goal itself.  Anything else that would get us to the same solution would be more than welcome.p

Negative 1531 pI need a little help setting up my query.  I dont want to have to make multiple selects to form basically the same subquery if I can avoid it.  In a nut shell, I have Objects called codeTimeSlotcode that are used to track several details.  Those codeTimeSlotcodes are items that are paid on.  When its time for the codeTimeSlotcode to submit for a reimbursement they are used to create a codePayableTimeSlotcode.  Before the codeTimeSlotcode can be paid I need to make sure it has not been paid already.  p  pAs it sits the following is my queryp  precodeNamedQuery    name  TimeSlot.by.person.academy.id.by.contract.date,    query  select distinct ts         from TimeSlot ts         join ts.invitedInstructors ii         join ts.academyClass ac         join ac.academy a         where ii.person.id           and a.id           and ts.schedule.startDateTime BETWEEN  AND           and ts.id not in select e.id from PayableTimeslot pts join pts.event e        and  not in select e.claimant from PayableTimeslot pts join pts.event e codepre  pAs you can see I am already selecting an element from the PayableTimeSot for the first codenot incode.  Is there a way to expand the subquery into codeselect e.id, e.claimant from PayableTimeslot pts join pts.event ecode  I am just not sure how to check for multiple items codenot incode the subquery.  By all means if there is a better attack of the problem than the way I am doing it let me know.p  pUnless you all think the multiple selects wont be a big deal...  There will be on average 3050 entrys a week into the table with each entry being copied for an audit trail upwards of 79 times.p
Negative 1531 pThe basic gist is, Im reading words from a text file, storing them as a string, running a function, and then looping over this multiple times, rewriting that string with every new line read. After this loop is done, I need to deal with a different string. The problem is, the second strings bytes, even though Ive memset them to 0 at declaration, are getting overwritten by the extra letters in words longer than the space Ive allocated to the first stringp  precodechar currDictWord  malloc9sizeofchar char currBrutWord  malloc9sizeofchar memsetcurrBrutWord, 0, 9 memsetcurrDictWord, 0, 9  ...  while stuff   fscanfdictionary, s, currDictWord    ...  printfword sn, currBrutWord codepre  pcurrBrutWord will not be empty anymore. The two ways Ive dealt with this are by either making sure currDictWord is longer than the longest word in the dictionary file kind of a ghetto solution, and doing a new memset on currBrutWord after the loop. Is there no way to tell C to stop writing stuff into memory Ive specifically allocated for a different variablep
Negative 1531 pCurrently I am designing an iOS application that will connect to a music stream through a network and play the audio to the user.p  pI have a simple setup with a button the enables the stream to start, and a UIwebview that connects to the stream. When I run the app on an iPhone, NOT a simulator, the button works fine and launches the Quicktime player to begin playback for the audio. Pausing and playing from this screen works like a charm as well.p  pHowever I want my user to be able to start up the stream, turn the phone off sleep the display and continue to listen to the stream. However sleeping the display will fade out the audio until it stops playback.p  pI have tried to go into the apps PList file like a few others have told me to do online and added the field Required background modes and added App plays audio or streams audiovideo using Airplay to the 0 array field and App downloads content from the network to the 1 array field.p  pApp plays audio was not offered through autocomplete even though that was the phrase told to make the stream work. Instead I left it as App plays audio or streams audiovideo using Airplay before trying it the other way to little more luckp  pHowever neither of these are allowing the audio to continue to play when the display has been put to sleep. Can anyone offer up a suggestion as to how to make it workp

Negative 1531 pHello from an R novice,p  pIm running simulations with a neural network model of word recognition. The model essentially has  detectors for each word in its lexicon at multiple temporal alignments e.g., there are actually 67 detectors for dog, aligned at successive time points. So the output from a simulation is a file with the activations of every word detector at every time step of the simulation. So if the simulation is run for 100 cycles, the file would have 100 timestamped activation records for all 67 dog units, and the same for every other word in the lexicon e.g., 100 x Words x 67 datapoints. I have a run a simulation with every word in the lexicon, and now I want to use facetwrap to make one plot for each simulation, plotting the overtime activations of the 10 most activated words. p  pIve figured out to convert that output to a time X detector matrix and then I sort that matrix by the peak activation of each column. I then remove everything but the top 10 columns. For a single simulation of a word like club, I wind up with data that looks like this just showing the head of the output for just 4 wordsp  precodegt headtraceOut.top[,c1,2,3,4,12]   time klb.s3 klb.s4 klu.s3 Target 1    0   0.01   0.01  0.01   klb 2    1   0.01   0.01  0.01   klb 3    2   0.01   0.01  0.01   klb 4    3   0.01   0.01  0.01   klb 5    4   0.01   0.01  0.01   klb 6    5   0.01   0.01  0.01   klb codepre  pThe column names indicate word detect  alignment. klb.s3 indicates the detector for club klb at slice 3 activations start changing after a couple dozen time steps. The Target column indicates what input has been given to the model.p  pI then melt the datap  precodegt traceOut.m2 ltmeltas.data.frametraceOut.top,id.varsctime,Target,variable.nameWord  gt headtraceOut.m2   time Target    Word Activation 1     0   klb klb.s3      0.01 2     1   klb klb.s3      0.01 3     2   klb klb.s3      0.01 4     3   klb klb.s3      0.01 5     4   klb klb.s3      0.01 6     5   klb klb.s3      0.01 codepre  pand rbind it to a data.frame called traceOut.m2.all that eventually has this kind of output for every target. p  pThen I try to use ggplot facetwrap to make a plot for every wordp  precodeggplottraceOut.m2.all, aestime,Activation,colorWord, shapeWord      facetwrap Target       geomlineaeslabelWord codepre  pThe problem is that the top 10 word detectors are different for each word. I would like each plot to have a legend including only its top 10 list. Instead, a single legend with all the word detectors that occur in any plot is created.

Negative 1531 pFrom what I understand correct me if I am wrong, the OpenGL api converts the function calls written by the programmer in the source code into the specific gpu driver calls of our graphic card. Then, the gpu driver is able to really send instructions and data to the graphic card through some hardware interface like PCIe, AGP or PCI.p  pMy question is, does openGL knows how to interact with different graphic cards because there are basically only 3 types of physical connections PCIe, AGP and PCIp  pI think it is not that simple, because I always read that different graphic cards have different drivers, so a driver is not just a way to use the physical interfaces, but it serves also the purpose to have graphic cards able to perform different types of commands which are vendor specific.p  pI just do not get the big picture.p

Im sorry, but Ive never used DirectX before, and I simply hoped to start doing stuff with the sample, so I dont have any background on how to debug these errors. They sound not even related to DirectX.p  pThis may or may not be important. I have had a number of problems with DirectX not for development before. A number of games I own will not start, complaining about DirectX doing something wrong. Whenever I try to run a DirectX runtime standalone installer, I get the message, This version of DirectX is not compatible with the version of windows currently installed. I dont know if this is related. And its a whole other thing Ive spent tons of time trying to fix, finding no information on, but thats a whole different story.p  pI run Windows 8.1 It was originally Windows 8 and I updated normally. DXDiag says I have DirectX 11.p  pThis has been quite frustrating, as when code doesnt work, I expect it to be my fault. When my compiler is given good code and it doesnt work, I get frustrated. Thank you for helping.p  pEDIT Thanks to Drop, for pointing out the obviously corrupted nature of xmemory0 in contrast with the plaintext in the others in that folder, this file looked like a nuclear meltdown. So if any of you could simply copy and paste in their xmemory0 to an answer, to save me the trouble of reinstalling I would be very glad. Thanksp  pEDIT 2 OK, looks like indeed there are a number of corrupted files and reinstalling VS for Desktop and for Windows Store did nothing to fix them. I tried copying files from VS 2012, but those too give errors, this time unrelated to a corrupted file. So what I am now asking for is please a zipped up include directory CProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0VCinclude. Thank youp

Negative 1531 pIn my app, I need to notify the user right after an event i.e. geofence transition or arriving push message. By notifying I mean posting a system notification with vibration, sound and LED flashing,p  pCurently, I am posting a notification via android.app.NotificationManager directly from BroadcastReceiver  and it works. But if a device is inactive for a long time, I can observe some delay between sending a GCM message and notification soundvibration it can be even few minutes. If I give up waiting earlier and wake the device manually, I get the notification immediately after screen is on.p  pAt first, Googles samples for GCM used the same pattern posting notification from BR. However, they changed the samples in August and now notification is posted from the IntentService, with partial wake lock obtained before starting the serivce.p  pI assume that my code in BR will be executed even if the device is in sleep mode. The question is, if NotificatonManager can post notification and make soundvibration in that state After performing some tests of both implementations, I didnt notice any significant difference, but I want to be sure that it works this way.p  pIn case of GCM, I know that there is an issue discused a hrefhttpsproductforums.google.comforummsgnexusfslYqYrULto6Yw1bL7arsJ relnofollowherea, which may be the cause of delay too. p  pstrongEditstrongp  pIt is clear for me that if device sleeps, it doesnt run any code at the application level. But on the kernel level, it can respond to some basic events such as incoming phone callsms, waking device up and generating broadcasts for BRs registered for this event.p  pFor me, it would be logical that such an event holds its wakelock until all BR callbacks are completed atomically  probably thats why onReceive cannot perform longrunning operations. I couldnt find any docs about it, so please correct me if you can prove that its not true.p  pBut, if the assumption above is correct, my broadcast should be received and executed immediately, because GCM has a wakelock. So the only delay between receiving GCM message and notifying user would be caused by NotificationManager.  Thats my main question  is such delay possible e.g. because of some async processingp

Negative 1531 pI am presently developing for a system which discourages i.e. essentially forbids dynamic libraries. Therefore, everything has to be linked statically.p  pThe application framework I am using which cannot be changed is using an old, staticallylinked version of a library codelibfoo.acode version r7. A library I am using, codelibbarcode, needs codelibfoo.acode version r8 specifically, some of the new features are crucial for the library to function. I can edit and recompile codelibbarcode as well as codelibfoocode r8, but I want to avoid changing them as much as possible because I am not very familiar with the code and would have to pass code changes upstream.p  pUnfortunately, the two codelibfoocode libraries have a substantial number of symbols in common. So, the linker spits out a ton of multiple symbol definition errors.p  pIve heard its possible to use codeobjcopycode and friends to inline a static library into another. However, Im not really sure how to achieve this in practice, nor if its even the best option.p  pSo, how can I successfully compile an executable which uses two, incompatible versions of the same library Ive already considered avoiding this situation but it will be much harder to work with.p

Negative 1531 pWe have implemented some metamagic for the codejavaccode compiler in form of an annotation codeProcessorcode. With some innocentlooking java source files, we get the following paradoxical error messagep  precode[javac] [checking org.dirtyice.underscores.towerdefense.wave.HumanSpawner] [javac] homekrisbmetowerdefensesrcgameorgdirtyiceunderscorestowerdefensewaveHumanSpawner.java9 cannot find symbol [javac] symbol class java [javac] Tracespawner [javac]         codepre  pTrace is the name of the annotation we are trying to process, but the error occurs in some other classes, with line numbers unrelated to the annotation being processed. The annotation processors applies a codeTreeTranslatorcode to the AST of the annotated class, thus rewriting the AST itself.p  pIf we invoke codeantcode or codejavaccode directly, the error goes away the program and the annotation processor appears to function correctly under Linux. Under Windows, the second compilation does not help and we again get the error. Of course, the error is thrown again even on Linux if we codeant cleancode or manually delete the output directory.p  pThe following error message appears with both JDK 1.7 and 1.6 the annotation processor being compiled with the corresponding tools.jar, of course.p  pIt appears as if javacs class file checker thinks that codejavacode is class, which it is absolutely not. We have no such class name in our projects class path at all, and we nowhere depend on it. Unfortunately, the class does not get written to the filesystem after it fails checking, so that we could inspect the  possibly badly mangled  class file.p  pWhat could cause such a puzzling compiler error Is there any way to inspect the failed class file after compilation and unravel this mysteryp  hr  pWe have managed to narrow the issue down to the followingp  pThere is a class, say codeWtfcode, which contains an switch statement switching on an enum see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4319152560450httpstackoverflow.coma4319152560450a or some other anonymous inner class. If classes, say, codeAAcode, codeBBcode, codeCCcode and codeDDcode inherit from codeWtfcode and contain at least one method codejavaccode seems to skip checking for empty classes, and the parts of the AST generated by the annotation processor contain references to codejava.lang.Objectcode of something else from codejava.langcode, then codeBBcode, codeCCcode and codeDDcode, i.e. all descendants but the lexicographically first will generate the error. The reason may possibly be some race condition inside codejavaccode related to loading the inner class and resolving references to codejava.langcode, or some other twisty little method calls, all alike.p

Negative 1531 pI am working on an app MUD game API and have started looking in to Role based permissions. Ive done some searching including on SO and have not quiet found an answer that matches my particular question.p  pSo Ive seen Claim Based security and UsersGroup based security. Since this is a Mud, there could potentially be several hundred Commands that the user enters through telnet. I thought about creating an IRole interface, implementing it for each Role the API supports. 3rd party developers can implement their own roles as well. Then providing each Role with a collection of Commands that they are allowed to use at server start up. Handing a reference to that role to the users based on authentication permissions. That seems like it introduces to much tight coupling between the commands and roles.p  pAnother option was to use an attribute at the class level for Types implementing ICommand. Again, this sounds like to much tight coupling.p  pWhat happens if a 3rd party developer decides they want to implement a Role in between User and Admin like QuestEditor for a role allowed to editcreate quests. The developer would have to either edit the commands to add the required attribute, or build a collection in the constructor of the Role of all commands it can use. If a new command is introduced, then all roles have to be updated which is a pain.p  pI also thought about a relational implementation, where roles are related through a hierarchy. So I can specify that a Command is required to have a minimum role of QuestEditor but any role related emupem the hierarchy is allowed to use the command as well, but not any role related emdownem the hierarchy. This allows Admins to use the command without editing their role, yet disallow StandardPlayer roles from using it. The issue is that every time a command is used, the hierarchy has to be crawled until the command finds the minimum role required. If QuestEditor is required, and the user is an admin, it cant infer that the user has the rights unless it crawls the hierarchy. Im not sure that this is a big issue, but one down side.p  pIm looking for input on what the best solution would be. I dont want to add update several hundred commands everytime a new role is created, nor do I want to update every role when a new command is created. Id like something generic that can be used. If you could share your experience or any patterns that exist Id appreciate itp  pThanksp

Negative 1531 pIn a category list, Id like to be able to display the list of articles dynamically. The website Im developing allows a user to submit an article once they have read it. When they hit the submit button, the ID of that article is stored in the database in a table called completedquests. What I need to do is have Joomla check to see if the article ID exists in both the content and the completedquests tables. If the article ID exists in both tables, then the article should not be displayed in the category list as that article or quest has already been submitted. If the article ID exists in the content table, but NOT in the completedquests table, then the article SHOULD be displayed in the category list as it has note yet been submitted. p  pIm wondering if there is a specific core Joomla file I should override to alter the category list output, or if I should develop a custom module to create this dynamic list. Any guidance would be much appreciated. If you have any other thoughts about how to display this dynamic list, Im all ears. p  pedit Ive started by developing a custom module within Joomla, at least for testing. The below code is not working as expected. When I take out the following line WHERE arp2icompletedquests.id IS NULL it displays a list of articles that exist in both tables. But what I need it to do is display the rows that exist in the content table but NOT in the completedquests table. When I add the WHERE , it displays the text ID and TABLE for each row that exists, but the actual id and title from that row is not echoed to the screen. Please help. p  pWorking code see comments. p  precodeltphp  query  SELECT  FROM arp2icompletedquests RIGHT JOIN arp2icontent ON arp2icontent.idarp2icompletedquests.id WHERE arp2icompletedquests.id IS NULL LIMIT 0, 30   prepare query  db  ampJFactorygetDBO  get database object dbgtsetQueryquery  apply query articles  dbgtloadObjectList  execute query, return result list  foreacharticles as article  loop through articles     echo ID . articlegtid .

Negative 1531 pThis is more of a Python 2 question, but Im curious about whether there are any differences in Python 3 as well.p  pI noticed that when creating certain methods on class whether they are newstyle or not, Python automatically decides that those classes are instances of some classes from the collections module. My example below demonstrates this with collections.Callable.p  precodegtgtgt import collections gtgtgt class A         def callself                 print A   gtgtgt a  A gtgtgt isinstancea, collections.Callable True gtgtgt class Aobject         def callself                 print A   gtgtgt a  A gtgtgt isinstancea, collections.Callable True gtgtgt class Aobject         pass  gtgtgt a  A gtgtgt isinstancea, collections.Callable False gtgtgt class A         pass  gtgtgt a  A gtgtgt isinstancea, collections.Callable False codepre  pYoull notice that I havent explicitly made any of those classes inherit from collections.Callable, but for some reason they all do as long as they create a codecallcode method. strongIs this done for a specific purpose and is it well defined somewhere Is Python automatically giving classes certain base classes just for defining methods or is something else going onstrongp  pYoull get similar results for collections.Iterable and the codeitercode method and some other special methods as well.p

Depending on what parts of the image I clip, the image shifts around, the width and height enlarge at different rates causing the crop region to change...p  pWhat I would like to be able to do is resize and, ideally, manipulate otherwise this cropped image as if it were a real image. Is there a better way to do it Otherwise, how can I fix that functionp  pI would be forever grateful for any help at all but please keep in mind I am a total novice and really dont know what Im doing so I need things explained somewhat lucidly for me. Im not asking anyone to do it for me but I have tried to come up with some method of doing what I want to do easily resizing the clipped image for days with no result. So, thank you in advance for any help anyone can offerp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong I have now created a fiddle but embarassingly enough I cant even get that to work. Nonetheless it can be found here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netXenthidex62L39 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netXenthidex62L39ap  pI have arbitrarily defined the initial clipping using values pulled from a crop function that I have not included as that seems to be working fine for the most part well, that and it would just overcomplicate the fiddle massively.

Negative 1531 pEssentially, what Im trying to do is add a decorator to a python function that would automatically run that function on a remote machine.

Now, weve noticed that we need to add an additional element to the array that we put into emBunchem. For a range of reasons, its not an option to change the signature of the method, nor is it feasible to add the extra element inside it.p  pI tried to add the extra thingy like sop  precodereturn table.Rows.CastltDataRowgt   .Selectrow gt new Something        Field  row[field1] as int,     Bunch  GetBunchindex.Addnew Thingy  ...     codepre  pbut it didnt work because emAddem doesnt return the original array with the new element in it. It returns an emintem. If the original object would be immutable, the result of emAddem would be what I wish but, apparently, it isnt.p  pIs it possible to immutabilize an mutable object If not because Im fairly certain its not, how can I handle this easily Easily  without storing the created thing and then accessing it and adding an element to emBunchem propertys array.p  pNB, the order of the result is of no importance in this case.

I then use the robot to paste the contents which works, but later when I use the robot to try to copy selected text on my screen, by simulating CTRLC, it seems to fail.

I dont know how to reset the ownership of clipboard. Java docs say that the lostOwnership method will be called when another application or another object within this application asserts ownership of the clipboard., so I dont think that its because it wont release ownership.p  pManually using ctrlc also fails to copy to clipboard.p

Negative 1531 pMy coding skills are admittedly very basic, and I typically only call on them when I need to write custom macros in Excel.p  pI just wrote a macro to perform a bulk find and replace in Excel.  I need to perform this function for over 150,000 cells worth of data.  I use a Do Loop to compare the value on Sheet A with the values FIND and related codes REPLACE on Sheet B.p  pI am using an index counter declared as Dim i as Integer, with a Do Loop controlling each iteration of the index.  The macro works, but I receive a RunTime error 6  Overflow error message once the index crosses 30,000  Is there a limit to how many times you can iterate a Do Loop, or does anyone know of a good way to perform a bulk find and replace in Excelp

Negative 1531 pI have a legacy COM application that hosts .NET plugins. Currently I have both CLR2 and CLR4 plugins hosted sidebyside. Some of these plugins communicate to each other via COM interop.p  pRecently I have run into a problem whereby a CLR4 plugin is calling a method of a CLR2 plugin via COM interop and passing it a delegate for callback. According to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary7esfatk428vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowmsdna by default it marshals delegates for COM interop as interfaces but it also allows you to marshal them as function pointers. If I marshal the delegate as a function pointer then I can use the callback successfully. If I use the default marshalling for the delegate then at the point I try and pass the callback delegate through I get an exception Unable to cast object of type System.ComObject to type mynamespace.mydelegatetype..p  pIf I do the same thing from a CLR2 plugin then it works with either type of marshalling.p  pIm also puzzled by how this marshalling as an interface actually works  looking in the type library it appears to create a coclass the delegate that has Delegate, Object, ICloneable and ISerializable interfaces as well as mydelegatetype which is defined as an emtpy interface inheriting from IDispatch. From the COM side of things I have a C test app that I use to test the CLR2 plugin by passing it a function pointer for the delegate it is expecting. It then calls back into the C test app successfully. But if I use the default marshalling Im not sure how Id actually assign my C callback function to a delegate interface the coclass is marked as noncreatable for starters.p

Negative 1531 pIs an I2C slave when transmitting to a master allowed to NACKp  pIt seems from the spec 2.1 there is no way for a slave to realistically send a NACK to a master while transmitting, i.e. sending data from the slave to the master.

Negative 1531 pIm working with SpriteKit and Im trying to make five nodes, with blend mode multiply, appear and disappear sequentially.p  pThe problem Im facing is that, when I call codeSKAction.fadeOutWithDurationdurationcode instead of fading out, the node turn black, as you can see in the imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnPztv.jpg altResultp  pBut, if I call codeSKAction.hidecode the node does hides instantaneously, Im confused on why these two functions have different results. My theory is that the codealphacode property of the node fill it with white color, instead of making it transparent turning black with the multiply blend. How can I make the node properly hide in a given timep  pFYI This is not a game, its a SKView inside of my UIKitbased app, Im working with SpriteKit because I really need the multiply blend and animations.p

Overall I have no clue how I am supposed to translate the words.p  pMy idea was to see what character in the alphabet shows up in the first position of the phrase to be translated then print the corresponding alphabet position for the morse alphabet then move onto the second position in the phrase however me messing around with for loops just ended with me getting errors about for loops getting far too huge and memory errors or just gave me a blank.p  pWith what I have right now whenever I enter the phrase to be translated it comes stops with a subscript out of range error and some of my earlier fiddling had it return jibberishmemory locations and I am really just out of ideas. I hope that this is phrased right and someone can help me because the past four hours of internet searches hasnt really helped me and to be honest at this point I am doubting if any of the stuff Ive written is any use at all.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt   int main      int operatingMode  0     using namespace std     stdstring latinPhrase     stdstring morsePhrase     stdstring latinAlphabet   A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, ., ,      stdstring morseAlphabet[30]   ., ..., .., .., ., ..., ., ...., .., ., ., ..., , ., , .., ., .., ..., , .., ..., ., .., ., .., ..., ..      stdstring translatedMorsePhrase     int wordSearch  0       stdcout ltlt Please select a mode of operation.  ltlt endl     stdcout ltlt Input 1 for English to Morse and 2 for Morse to English.  ltlt endl      stdcin gtgt operatingMode      stdcout ltlt Your mode of operation is  ltlt operatingMode ltlt endl      if operatingMode  1              stdcout ltlt You have selected English to Morse. ltlt endl         stdcout ltlt Please enter the phrase you would like translated. ltlt endl          stdcin.ignore         stdgetlinestdcin, latinPhrase           for int counter  0 counter lt 30 counter              for unsigned i  0 iltlatinPhrase.length i                          if latinPhrase.ati  latinAlphabet[i]                                      cout ltlt morseAlphabet[i]                                    stdcout ltlt The translated phrase is  ltlt translatedMorsePhrase ltlt  stop ltlt endl       return 0  codepre

Negative 1531 pIm using the a hrefhttpsgithub.commongodbnodemongodbnative relnofollownative MongoDB driver for Node.jsa and Im trying to find a way to catch exceptions that may happen in the APIs callbacks.p  pI know that best practice would be to wrap the code in a trycatch block, but in my particular case I expose the drivers API to users so I dont have that level of control. Still, I need to catch potential exceptions happening in callbacks in order to send back relevant error messages.p  pstrongEDIT further explanations.strong Think of some backendasaservice where users can create JS code that is run on the server, in Node. The user code has direct access to a codedbcode object from the driver and can do whatever it wants with it, like writing the followingp  precodedb.collectiontest.findOne field value , functionerr, doc   throw new Error  codepre  pI need to somehow catch that but codeprocess.onuncaughtExceptioncode is too low level for me.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 1531 pI have Windows 7 32 bit and wanted to work on wordpress to host my own page but to do that I got virtual server WAMP Server V 2.5 and after installing it, icon in taskbar was orange and after right and left clicking, there was no menu.  I read many forums, disabled IIS and restarted and nothing. Also uninstalled, deleted directory on c, installed again but same result, no menu, orange icon. Im not a tech expert, so pls customize your answers keeping this in mind. I have no idea how to check logs etc So pls let me know. Much obliged.p  pForgot to mention that hovering mouse over icon it says, 1 of 2 services runningserver offline. I typed localhost and an IIS image showed up. So, after disabling IIS and restarting, my WAMP icon has disappeared altogether. So I enabled IIS again but the IIS does not check altogether as its shaded the FTP option is unchecked. After this I restarted and the WAMP icon didnt show again. This happened yesterday and I reinstalled WAMP as I did now but still nothing. Also inside the WAMP folder, there is no apache folder nor is there any menu display from the WAMP icon on taskbar as mentioned above. Which other way is there to find out about the port my WAMP is using. And I dont have Skype.p

Negative 1531 pI am working in a project that uses ProtoBuf in different languages among them .NET. For .NET we use protobufnet. We have extended enums and they work on the other platforms but in .NET we get a exception when trying to deserialize. When googling this i found this a hrefhttpcode.google.compprotobufnetissuesdetailid422 relnofollowIssue 422a. Does anyone have a good workaround or know what to download and compile for a local fix. We would prefer not to introduce weird extra enums or other weird stuff that goes against the Protobuf definition.p

Negative 1531 pIm familiar with Flask for building simple webapps and using jinja2 as a template engine. However, Id like to try out React.js as a frontend.p  pThe examples Ive seen that use React.js with a Python backend essentially use it as an API server to call the json needed to include in the React views. However, how does this work with authentication models and libraries for Flask Can you mixandmatch jinja2 and React.js within the same template, to get access to the session datap  pAny pointers or experience to help get started would be appreciated.p

Negative 1531 pIm building both a Symfony 2.6 web app and a composer library.  The composer library knows nothing of Symfony and needs to operate with other frameworks or no framework at all.p  pAt some point the library needs to redirect the user.  Of course its natural in a simple library to call PHPs codeheaderLocation xcode.  This works fine when testing the library with straight PHP and no framework.  But within a Symfony app the controller calling the library still needs to create a codeResponsecode object and return it.  In fact creating an empty codeResponsecode ends up clearing the redirect.  I assume the Symfony classes create a whole new set of headers, overwriting the codeLocationcode set in the library.p  pSo without making my library dependent on Symfony how can it redirect the userp

Using recursion to solve non recursive problems in an imperativeOO language is to ask for trouble. Ten or 100 iterations should be safe. But what about 10000 or an infinite loop  In purely functional languages as Erlang and Haskell I know that tail recursions are converted to loops during compile time and will not add an extra frame to the stack. That is as far as I know not the case for all compilers of for example CC or Java.p  pHow about JS Is it safe to use tail recursion there without the risk of an SO Or will this depend on the actual interpreter the script runs onp

Negative 1531 pI have a simple project which is running in a console window. I want to run it in a web browser. How can I achieve it That means, I want to convert that project into a web browser runnable project. The start button from the Visual Studio tool bar have to change with the web browser name, eg. Firefox. For instance, in an MVC project, in Visual Studio we cant see the Start button, instead of that the browser name is showing. I want to convert my project like that. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 1531 pIm using MySQL.  I have a table with a field called UnitName.  I just want to display all the UnitNames in order.   The Unit Names can varyp  precode101 T101 G202 1005 O1305 codepre  pWhen I display them using ORDER BY UnitName, The results are not sorted properly.  For instance 1000 will come before 101, T2000 will come before T201.   If they were all numeric values, I would try to use CASTUnitName AS INT, but unfortunately I have to deal with the Alpha and other  characters.   p  pI believe the way to approach this is to make sure that the UnitNames have the same length, and then they will sort properly.   So basically I am trying to insert a number of zeros into the middle of the string until the lengths are identical and then ORDER BY that.   p  pMy query currently is listed below.p  precodeltcfquery nameGetdatasourcerentgt     SELECT  FROM Units      ORDER BY LeftUnitName,2RepeatString0, 10LENUnitNamerightUnitName, LENUnitName2    ltCFQUERYgt codepre  pIm basically saying sort by the 2 left characters of the stringa number of 0s determined by the number 10 minus the length of the stringthe characters on the right side of the string except the first 2.   p  pWhen I just do a CFOUTPUT of this the UnitName comes out perfectly. I do have to had some  to make it work  LeftUnitName,2RepeatString0, 10LENUnitNamerightUnitName, lenUnitName2p  pBut the query fails to execute as written below.   Ive narrowed it down to the middle section where Im trying to determine the number of Zeros to insert.   Specifically if I usep  pcodeRepeatString0, 105code, the query will execute.  But the minute I put LENUnitName instead of 5, the query fails.   Any idea what Im doing wrongp  pAny insight is appreciatedIve been banging my head against a wall.p

Negative 1531 pBoth codengRoutecode and codeUI Routercode provide coderesolvecode method on url definitions which should resolve before the route is loaded. Ive seen a lot of pages explaining how to use it but almost none define benefits for using it.

This usage is more related to security. p  pIn the examples Ive seen its mostly used to get and inject initial data into controller, but I can also easily do that using service within a controller. So why use coderesolvecode Moreover, by using coderesolvecode I should handle coderejectedcode promise when data is not available for some reason. The controller which should receive that data wont even be initialized and so I should handle coderouteChangeFailedcode event on coderootScopecode to decide how to proceed. Besides, I also somehow should pass information on what route failed and why.p  pSo again, two questionsbr 1 Whats the benefits of using coderesolvecode method for data retrievalbr 2 What are the common approaches to handling rejectionsfailed data retrieval situationsp  pPS.

Negative 1531 pWe all heard that injecting repository into aggregate is a bad idea, but almost no one tells why.p  pI will try to write here all disadvantages of doing this, so we can measure rightness of this statement.p  pstrongFirst thing that comes into my head is Single Responsibility Principle.strongp  pIts true that emby injecting repository into AR we are violating SRP, because retrieving and persisting of aggregate is not responsibility of aggregate itselfem. But it says only about aggregate itself, not about other aggregates. So does it apply for retrieving from repository aggregates referenced by id And what about storing themp  pI used to think that aggregate shouldnt even know that there is some sort of persistence in system, because it doesnt have to exist. Aggregates can be created just for one procedure call and then get rid of.p  pNow when I think of it, its not right, because aggregate root is an entity, and entity has sense only if it has some unique identity. So why would we need unique identity if not for persisting Even if its just a persistence in a memory. Maybe for comparing, but in my opinion its not a main reason behind the identity.p  pstrongOk, lets assume that we retrieve and store OTHER aggregates from inside of our aggregate using injected repositories. What are other consequences beside SRP violationstrongp  pFor sure there is a problem with having no control over persisting of aggregates and retrieving is some kind of lazy loading, which is bad for the same reason no control. p  pBecause of no control we can come into situation when we persist the same aggregate few times, where it could be persisted only once, or the same aggregate is loaded one hundred times where it could be loaded once, hence performance is worse. Also there might be problem with stale data.p  pThese reasons practically disqualifies ability to inject repository into aggregate.p  pstrongHere comes my main question  why can we inject repositories into domain service thenstrongp  pNot the same reasons applies here Its just like moving logic out of aggregate into separate function and pretend it to be something different.p  pTo be honest, when I stared to write this SO question, I had no good answer for that. But after hours of investigating this problem and writing of this question I came to solution. Rubber duck debugging.p  pIll post this question anyway for others having the same problems. Of course with my answer below.p
Negative 1531 pI have some testclasses which usually look as followsp  precodeRunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional public class SpringTestRunnerTransactionTest    Some tests which involve inserting data in the db here gt No persisted entries but    entries can be fetched in same transaction  codepre  pwhich pass all my current tests wich also include querying inserted data which has been inserted in the same testcase. However, when I inspect the database afterwards, there are no persisted entries.  The same holds true when adding the codeorg.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactionalcode annotation on top of a test method, i.e. p  precodeRunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class public class SpringTestRunnerTransactionTest     org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional    Test    public void test        Some tests which involve inserting data in the db here gt No persisted entries but        entries can be fetched in same transaction       codepre  pHowever, funny enough, adding the annotation to some dummy method, finally the entries are persisted in the db. I.e. the following worksp  precode    RunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class     public class SpringTestRunnerTransactionTest           Test         public void test              abstraction                   org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional         public void abstraction              Doing all the tests here works fine and the entities               are persisted in the database              codepre  pNow I was wondering why this is happening. I assume that in the first case either the transaction is not committed or rollbacked but I dont see why. Or is there a general problem annotating testclasses and methods directlyp  pSome further information I am using a SpringData JPA  Hibernate  H2 stack.p  pThanks p
Negative 1531 pI have a system where users can nput customer information.

What I am hoping to do is to find the a string that contains two letters codeScode and codeLcode in this order. I need to be able to find the string regardless of characters ie S.L., S.L and also regardless of case.

Negative 1531 pI have been playing with Munin lately v2.0.25 and would like to use it with a virtual host in apache. p  pI have read the docs that go through using apache as a reverse proxy, but I figure, since the munin graphs are built into a folder in the web root, i can make a virtual host that uses that as the doc root, and treat is as a subdomain. p  pThis works as expected, no problems. However I noticed that the munin apache.conf file seems to be symlinked to the apache availableconf dir at install time, and so this is still active, meaning there are two URLs which will point to the same content. My solution to this was simple and brutal  delete the symlinks, and again, it works. But there has to be a cleaner way, right A config setting ive missed p

So when the Macro is being clicked in Outlook it gets the data, puts it in an XML file and then it should launch the ASP file. p  pThere is an other way to do it, namely by using a Task Scheduler on my server which launches the ASP file every X minutes and looks for the XML file. This possibility is something I rather avoid though because if a outlook user presses the Outlook macro multiple times in a short time the XML files will overwrite each otter and thus having the change of not getting ALL the right data. p  pI didnt add my code since I think it is not really needed here since the code I have is working, though if code is needed just ask  p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I found a piece of code which opens the asp file on the web and thus launching it.

Negative 1531 pSpecifically using uibootstraps datepicker and NO jQuery...p  pSo, Im trying to sew together a date range picker of sorts from two datepickers and its pretty close. Im trying to disable dates on the start calendar based on the date selected on the end calendar and vice versa. The problem is that the start calendar only refreshes or rerenders when a selection is made on that calendar. So if I select a date on the end calendar, the start calendar will not rerun the disabledate function and rerender until I pick a date on the start calendar again.p  pDoes anyone know a way to force a rerender of a calendar or make a direct call to the supplied disabledate or customclass functionsp

collection with many of these docs one doc represents 1 hourp  precodeid  ObjectId5558ab960e8956234285de14,     timestamphour  ISODate20141013T230000.0000200,     name  memfree,     unity  B,

Negative 1531 pI know how to use codeintentcodes practically, however I dont really understand p  ol liWhat really happens when you write codethiscode and pass it as a parameter in a method from an codeActivitycode. li ol  pI know that the reserved keyword codethiscode in java refers to an object. I double checked what it really does with the a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavajavaOOthiskey.html relnofollowjavadocsap  blockquote   pWithin an instance method or a constructor, this is a reference to the   current object  the object whose method or constructor is being   called. You can refer to any member of the current object from within   an instance method or a constructor by using this.p blockquote  pFrom the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicsfirstappstartingactivity.html relnofollowandroid documentationa they explain that the codethiscode keywords references tot the codeContextcode instance that is the superclass of the Activity class.p  blockquote   pthis is used because the Activity class is a subclass of Contextp blockquote  pI have no idea how this precisely works. All I know is that in xml I define a codeonClickcode listener which specifies a method name, and because the layout is inflated from a specific class I think that it could be possible that an object of the inflated class is created at a certain time and the codethiscode refers to this codeActivitycode object. Is it then downcasted to it superclass codeContextcode automatically by automatic type conversionp

Negative 1531 pI am designing a java app that uses algorithms to import data from other sources into a database.  And the app also searches for records in the database.  p  pstrongHow can I implement row level security in a way that the database does not even know that the data is encrypted, but also in a way that allows searching of the database using queries called from the java codestrong  p  pI can use BouncyCastle to encrypt each field in each row of data before it is inserted into the database.  But then how do I search the rows if every row and field in the database is individually encrypted  Is the answer as simple as encrypting each search parameter using the same keys before the search parameters are passed into the SQL or JPA SELECT queries  Or is a more complicated approach required  p  pI am using MySQL at the moment, but it would be nice if this were agnostic with respect to database vendor.p

Negative 1531 pI am having a problem. I received an assignment to write pseudo code for a palindrome checking program.

Negative 1531 pFrom a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavautilstreamStream.html relnofollowthe docsap  blockquote   pStreams have a BaseStream.close method and implement AutoCloseable,   but nearly all stream instances do not actually need to be closed   after use. Generally, only streams whose source is an IO channel such   as those returned by Files.linesPath, Charset will require closing.   Most streams are backed by collections, arrays, or generating   functions, which require no special resource management. If a stream   does require closing, it can be declared as a resource in a   trywithresources statement.p blockquote  pWhen I create a codeStreamltStringgtcode using the codelinescode method on a codeBufferedReadercode as seen below, does closing the codeStreamcode also close the codeBufferedReadercodep  precodetry StreamltStringgt lines  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderprocess.getInputStream.lines     Do stuff    Is the BufferedReader, InputStreamReader and InputStream closed codepre  pSome really quick tests Ive tried say no the codeincode field of the codeBufferedReadercode is not codenullcode, but then Im confused by the following sentence, since this example is IO as well, rightp  blockquote   pGenerally, only streams whose source is an IO channel such   as those returned by Files.linesPath, Charset will require closing.p blockquote  pIf not, do I need to close embothem instances, or will closing the codeBufferedReadercode sufficep  hr  pemIdeally, Id like to return a codeStreamltStringgtcode from some method, without having the client worry about the readers.

Negative 1531 pI want to do in SQLp  ul listep 1 read data from tables A, B, Cli listep 2 do some calculationsli liwrite back data to tables A, B, Cli ul  pBut this must be concurrent proof, meaning that once step 1 is done, every other instance needs to wait for step 1 until step 3 is finished since it changes the data to do the calculations. Here is a simplified example Ive left out some declarations and used hard coded valuesp  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE AddOrder AS BEGIN      Step 1 read every other call to AddOrder should wait here until this procedure has finished     SELECT TotalOrderAmount  sumAmount FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID  5       Step 2 modify     SELECT DiscountPct  CASE WHEN TotalOrderAmount gt 1000.00 THEN 0.10 ELSE 0.00 END     SELECT Amount  9.99  1  DiscountPct       Step 3 write     INSERT INTO OrdersCustomerID, Amount VALUES 5, Amount END codepre  pThe first thing in my mind was of course use a transaction with a raised isolation levelp  precodeSET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATBLE READ BEGIN TRAN      Step 1      Step 2      Step 3 COMMIT TRAN codepre  pBut this wont solve anything. Assume that 2 connections execute the procedure at exactly the same time. Step 1 will place and hold a sharedread lock and both connections will go trough step one which is already wrong. But it gets worse, since there are 2 locks on the table that will be updated in step 3, there will be a deadlock.p  pI dont want to group everything into a single statement if this would solve anything because my real situation is of course more complex than the example.p  pI also would like to use the range locking of a modern SQL Server rather than locking the entire table, so that only the rows for that CustomerID will be locked. And finally, i dont wont optimistic locking, so both calls should always succeed.p  pDoes anyone has a simple solution for this problemp  pUPDATEp  pAt first, it seems that using a table hint UPDLOCK would solve the issue. For examplep  precode    BEGIN TRAN          Step 1 read or wait until other instance has finished         SELECT TotalOrderAmount  sumAmount FROM Orders with UPDLOCK, ROWLOCK WHERE CustomerID  5           Step 2 modify         SELECT DiscountPct  CASE WHEN TotalOrderAmount gt 1000.00 THEN 0.10 ELSE 0.00 END         SELECT Amount  9.99  1  DiscountPct           Step 3 write         INSERT INTO OrdersCustomerID, Amount VALUES 5, Amount     COMMIT TRAN codepre  pThe great benefit is that only the order rows for CustomerID  5 will be locked so most of the calls wont even wait at all since they are used with different customers.p  pBut this approach still leaves one major shortcoming for new customers it wont work at all, since there are no rows yet to lock. So 2 concurrent calls with the same new CustomerID that has no orders yet wont wait for each other.p  pSo in addition to UPDLOCK, ROWLOCK i would need something likep  ul liif the range exist, do a ROWLOCKli liif the range doesnt exist, do a TABLOCK or something like a new row lockli ul  pSomething likep  precodeBEGIN TRAN     IF EXISTSSELECT  FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID  5         SELECT TotalOrderAmount  sumAmount FROM Orders with UPDLOCK, ROWLOCK WHERE CustomerID  5     ELSE         SELECT TotalOrderAmount  sumAmount FROM Orders with UPDLOCK, TABLOCK WHERE CustomerID  5 codepre  pBut in 1 statement because the IF EXISTS also needs to be concurrent proof. The TABLOCK also doesnt seems the best solution because when a new customer is selected, the existing customers acquiring a ROWLOCK are also waiting for the release of the TABLOCK. Thats why I mention new row lock above.p

But no button to generate a merge request is to be found anywhere, although I am logged into my account.p  pI was also unable to see any such option when going to Merge requests in the sidebar of the originating project.p  pThe strange thing is that I have done it in the past and Id swear that there was usually a Create merge request button.p  pSo two options came to mind 1. the version of Gitlab was updated and the new version doesnt have the feature or moved it elsewhere and 2. something is strange about my commit that prevents Gitlab from offering this option.p  pCan anyone shed some light on thisp
Negative 1531 pI am currently working on MVC project. Project is about Time management. In my project, I want that when the employee of a company login by or more than 15 mins delay then the delay mins should recorded in the database as the login time of company is 1000 am. When the employee wants to see his last month login detail then he should get the delay time of particular date. This will help the admin to deduct the salary accordingly without searching the whole data of the employee.p  pThank you in Advance.p

Negative 1531 pI have been working on codeCollectionscode recently and I have a potentially huge list of items to be processed that is returned by the backend.

I tried printing size of the Map inside the for loop and in Eclipse I work on Eclipse IDE I could see the thread execution halting at codeModelContext Threadcode and the console slowly printing the size of the Map after each execution of the inner for loop 1000 items which is really bad with respect to timeefficiency. Is there a way I could break down these operations into smaller modules and increase timeefficiencyp  pCould someone please suggestadvice a better approach to process these huge list of items considering that the items returned by the backend may grow over time My new approach should reduce the execution time by a fair margin, otherwise the overall performance of my Application would really be bad.p  pIs there a more cleaner and efficient way to handle these increasingly rare scenariosp  pThank you All.p

Negative 1531 pIf I have an HTML page on my site with a large number of script tags pointing to a hrefhttpcdnjs.cloudflare.com relnofollowhttpcdnjs.cloudflare.coma, will this slow down page loading Im thinking that it will fetch them all in a single TCP connection, but will make multiple GET requests, whereas if I provide them from my own server then all the javascript can be concatenated into a single file. Does this make a significant difference Is it likely that the speed benefits of the CDN caching, proximity, etc. will at least mostly nullify itp  pUpdate Ive just discovered jsDelivr which actually provides arbitrary concatenations of the libraries it hosts, e.g. a hrefhttpscdn.jsdelivr.netgreact0.13.3,jquery2.1.4 relnofollowhttpscdn.jsdelivr.netgreact0.13.3,jquery2.1.4a.

Negative 1531 pI would like to have a codengifcode javascriptbased animation that animates elements leaving. However, if the boolean controlling codengifcode changes back to codetruecode before the element has left the DOM, I would like for the existing element to be reused, rather than a new one created.p  pThe issue can be seen using a simple animation that doesnt actually do anything but take up timep  precodeapp.animation.toggle, functionwindow    return      leave functionelement, done        window.setTimeoutdone, 2000          codepre  pwith HTML likep  precodeltbutton ngclicktoggle  togglegtToggle me a lotltbuttongt ltp ngiftoggle classtogglegtShould only ever be one of theseltpgt codepre  pIf you can the codengifcode condition on an element with the class codetogglecode multiple times in quick succession, then several of them end up in the DOM. Is it possible to only have at most one of them in the DOM at any one time p  pMy reason is that it feels more expected at least for me for the element that is already on screen to react to changes in state, from its current position in animation, rather than a new one created as though the previous one had fully disappeared. My actual use case is using Angular UI router views, where moving backforwards between states causes the same template to be in the DOM multiple times, but Im hoping that answers to this question may inspire solutions to the more complicated routing case.p  pI realise I can use nghide or ngclass, but I would like for the element to be removed from the DOM at the end of the animation. This would also hopefully make the answer to this question more similar to the UI routing case, as uiview behaves more like ngif in it is addedremoved to the DOM on state change.p  pYou can see the above example at a hrefhttpplnkr.coedithvEshhqOiC31q9wSjtL1ppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coedithvEshhqOiC31q9wSjtL1ppreviewap

I see Struts itself has used it in one of its interceptors, codeorg.apache.struts2.interceptor.ActionMappingParametersInteceptor.addParametersToContextActionContext, Mapcode as belowp  precodeOverride protected void addParametersToContextActionContext ac, Map newParams      Map previousParams  ac.getParameters     Map combinedParams     if previousParams  null          combinedParams  new TreeMappreviousParams      else          combinedParams  new TreeMap          combinedParams.putAllnewParams      ac.setParameterscombinedParams  codepre  pIs it safe to do same in my own action method rather than an interceptor If no, what are alternatives Is it possible at all I really need to do this in my action chains because its so hard to rewrite these actions to use coderedirectActioncode instead of codechaincode.p
