Positive 263 pIm using win764bitp  pI am in the process of developing a user interface for a USB CDC device used as a flash programmer I am adding in exception handlers and constantly testing, but whenever something does go wrong and the program crashes, the USB device disappears from device manager and will not reconnect. I uninstall and reinstall the driver which I have made automatic in the c GUI but this doesnt fix it either. Nor does resetting the computer, changing USB ports, etc.. The only way I know to fix it is to delete the registry entries for the specific PID  VID stuff and then unplug the USB and plug it back in. Windows the reinstalls it because it still has the inf file and it works perfectly. This shouldnt be an issue in the release version, but for testing it has been a real problem constantly going through that process. p  pMy question is why is this happening p

Negative 263 pMy experience with MySQL is very basic.  The simple stuff is easy enough, but I ran into something that is going to require a little more knowledge.  I have a need for a table that stores a small list of words.  The number of words stored could be anywhere between 1 to 15.  Later, I plan on searching through the table by these words.  I have thought about a few different methodsp  pA. I could create the database with 15 fields, and just fill the fields with null values whenever the data is smaller than 15. I dont really like this.  It seems really inefficient.  p  pB. Another option is to use just a single field, and store the data as a comma separated list.  Whenever I come back to search, I would just run a regular expression on the field.  Again, this seems really inefficient.p  pI would hope there is a good alternative to those two options.  Any advice would be very appreciated.p  pThanksp

Ideally, the prototype would look good enough to show to the users in order to gather feedback.p  pA few ajaxstyle dropdown menus or controls would be useful to demonstrate our ideas, but not at the expense of quick prototyping.p  pIt feels too early to break out Visual Studio, and we need something more than pen and paper or Visio... Any suggestionsp

Negative 263 pI have some functions written in C that I call from Haskell.  These functions return codeIO CIntcode.  Sometimes I want to run all of the functions regardless of what any of them return, and this is easy.  For sake of example code, this is the general idea of whats happening currentlyp  precodePreludegt let f x  print x gtgt return x Preludegt mapM f [0..5] 0 1 2 3 4 5 Preludegt codepre  pI get my desired side effects, and I dont care about the results.  But now I need to stop execution immediately after the first item that doesnt return my desired result.  Lets say a return value of 4 or higher requires execution to stop  then what I emwantem to do is thisp  precodePreludegt takeWhile lt4  mapM f [0..5] codepre  pWhich gives me this errorp  pre ltinteractive122     Couldnt match expected type [b] against inferred type IO a     In the first argument of mapM, namely f     In the second argument of , namely mapM f [0 .. 5]     In the expression takeWhile lt 4  mapM f [0 .. 5]pre  pAnd that makes sense to me  the result is still contained in the IO monad, and I cant just compare two values contained in the IO monad.  I know this is precisely the purpose of monads  chaining results together and discarding operations when a certain condition is met  but is there an easy way to wrap up the IO monad in this case to stop executing the chain upon a condition of my choosing, without writing an instance of codeMonadPluscode  p  pCan I just unlift the values from codefcode, for the purposes of the takeWhile  p  pIs this a solution where functors fit  Functors havent clicked with me yet, but I sort of have the impression that this might be a good situation to use them.p  phr strongUpdatestrongp  psth has the closest answer to what I want  in fact, thats almost exactly what I was going for, but Id still like to see whether there is a emstandardem solution that isnt explicitly recursive  this is Haskell, after all  Looking back on how I worded my question, now I can see that I wasnt clear enough about my desired behavior.p  pThe codefcode function I used above for an example was merely an example.  The real functions are written in C and used exclusively for their side effects.  I cant use Toms suggestion of codemapM f takeWhile lt4 [0..5]code because I have no idea whether any input will really result in success or failure until executed.p  pI dont actually care about the returned list, either  I just want to call the C functions until either the list is exhausted or the first C function returns a failure code.p  pIn Cstyle pseudocode, my behavior would bep  precodedo      result  functionwithsideeffectsinputlist[index]  while result  success ampamp index lt maxindex codepre  pSo again, sths answer performs the exact behavior that I want, except that the results may should be discarded.  A codedropWhileMcode function would be equivalent for my purposes.  Why isnt there a function like that or codetakeWhileMcode in Control.Monad  I see that there was a hrefhttposdir.commllibrarieshaskell.org200905msg00031.html relnofollowa similar discussion on a mailing lista, but it appears that nothing has come of that.p

Negative 263 pI hope this isnt too subjective. I cant decide between these two design opportunities.p  pI have a Front Controller pattern. When the user surfs to a specific URL, my framework loads a specified View Controller for this URL. The View Controller then calculates some things and loads a View Template, to show the results. p  pNow imagine you wanted to make a site like SO. Every page looks pretty similar Same header, same menu, same footer. Just the content area is different. You surf to the Ask Question page, and want the Ask new Question form to come up inside the layout.p  pSo we make a codeRootViewControllercode with a codeRootViewcode template that sets up the layout and has a placeholder for the content. And a codeAskQuestionViewControllercode with an codeAskQuestionViewcode template.p  pOur Front Controller loads the codeAskQuestionViewControllercode class. The system calls the codeloadViewcode method, and then the codeviewDidLoadcode method.p  h2Option A codeAskQuestionViewControllercode inherits from codeRootViewControllercode.h2  pmethod gets called by the system, and calls codeparentloadViewcode first. So codeRootViewControllercode gets the chance to create its codeRootViewcode template. Next, codeloadViewcode loads the codeAskQuestionViewcode template, and assigns it to the content placeholder of the codeRootViewcode template.p  h2Option B codeAskQuestionViewControllercode does not inherit from codeRootViewControllercode.h2  pThe codeloadViewcode method of codeAskQuestionViewControllercode loads codeRootViewControllercode first. Then it loads its own codeAskQuestionViewcode template, and assigns it to the content placeholder of the codeRootViewcode template.p  pThe only differences between these View Controllers are, that they load different View templates, and that they have different custom methods to perform certain tasks. i.e. the codeRootViewControllercode is able to compose the Navigation Menu and highlight whats currently visited. Theres nothing else in codeRootViewControllercode that could be useful for codeAskQuestionViewControllercode.p  pWhich Option would be better designp

Negative 263 pim building this application in which i have a client represented by a thread, running in loop until it receives the instruction to terminate trying to access a critical section of data in the server.p  pWhen the first client connects to the server, he owns the lock to that mutex. all the subsequent connections are put to a hold. This is the normal part of it.p  pBut then, when the first thread unlocks, the loop brings it back to the begining and it should be contending for the lock again. But its assumed that he still holds the lock and executes the critical section in an almost infinite loop not infinite because we can terminate the thread, giving the lock away for the other threads. p  pTo resume it all...when the first client connects, it owns the lock forever.

Negative 263 pI just started to learn how to use action listeners. To my understanding it works in the following wayp  ol lipThere are some classes which contains addActionListener method by default for example classes for buttons.pli lipUsing this method we add an action listener to an object. For example codelistenedObject.addActionListenerlisteningObjectcode.pli lipWhen an action with the listenedObject is performed, the actionPerformed method of the listeningObject will be called. So, it means that when we program a class for the listeningObject, we need to put there actionPerformed method.pli ol  pWhat is not clear to me, should we create a new class for every object that we want to listen. It does not seem to me as an elegant solution. On the other hand, if we have one action listener class for all or at least many object, than we have a problem since a instance of this class will not know which object is calling the actionPerformed method and we need to know that since actions performed by the actionPerformed differs depending on who is called for this method.p  pIn my opinion, for every listened object we need to create are personal action listener and we can do it by setting a specific value to the corresponding field of the action listener. But I am not sure that it is a standard way to go How do usually people do itp

Negative 263 pI have renamed with codesvn movecode a emlotem of files in a subversion project. Now, I am trying to commit these on Windows cmd.exe. It seems that I hit a limit probably by cmd.exe in that the number of files is too long for the command line to swallow.p  pNow, I thought and hoped that I could list the files to commit in a seperate file that I could specify with the commit command something like codesvn ci filestocommitrenamedfiles.txt m Renamed a lot of filescodep  pYet, either such an option does not exist or I am unable to find this.p  pUnfortunately, I cannot do a codesvn ci .code as I have done other changes in the project as well. Neither can I do a codesvn ci patternofrenamedfilescode since this would only check in the added files, not the deleted ones.p  pBefore I start checking in the files with smaller chunks of files to check in and thus increase the revision number uneccesserily without giving a hint as to the atomicity of the operation I thought I ask if this is indeed impossible to do.p

Negative 263 pThis is a followup question to the one I posted last week a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3065528ajaxactionlinkisnotpostingAjax.ActionLink not Postinga.  I did finally get it to Post, and it properly calls my Delete action and deletes the record.  The Delete method returns a RedirectToActionList so that the new data set minus the deleted record is relisted.  Except that what actually happens is  NOTHING.  The listing doesnt change. And Im pretty sure I know why calling Ajax.ActionLink returns an Ajax result which is only supposed to replace a designated element the UpdateTargetId option parameter in the document.  And since I havent designated any, it doesnt replace anything, even though its a whole fresh page.p  pMy question is, what do I pass to the AjaxOption.UpdateTargetId to get it to wipe the whole page and reload with the new result, just as though Html.ActionLink had been called recalling that the only reason for using Ajax.ActionLink was that I wanted the method invoked with a POST instead of a GET And since this page uses a Master Page, I dont have the option of just putting an ID on the body element.p

Negative 263 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIve written a small C.NET 4.0 application that syncs various settings from a game installed in Program Files to and from other copies of the same game on different machines think Chrome bookmark sync, but for this game. The sync itself is a relatively simple affair, dealing with files stored inside the games Program Files folder. p  pOn my machine, this works fine without having to elevate my application through UAC. Windows 7 makes the game use Program Files virtualisation and my application works fine with that.p  pHowever, on a lot of testers machines, Im getting reports that the application either cant work with the files and in come cases cant even see the games folder Having the user rightclick and Run as Administrator solves the problem in every case.p  pSo, we just set the applications manifest to require admin privileges, right Thats fine although not ideal for when the user manually invokes the application or the sync process because theyll be interacting with the application and ready to accept a UAC request.p  pHowever, one of the features of my application is a Sync Automatically option, which allows the user to set and forget the application. With this set, the application puts itself into the registry at HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun to be run at startup and sits in the system tray syncing the settings in the background as needed.p  pObviously, I need to be smarter here. Presenting a UAC prompt as soon as the user logs in to their account or at random intervals afterwards isnt the way forwards. p  pstrongSo, my questionstrongp  pWhats the best way to approach a situation where Id need to run an application at startup that needs administrator privileges Is there a way to have the user authorise an installation that causes the system to automatically run the application with the correct privileges without a prompt at startuploginp  pstrongUpdatestrong Just to be clear, this must be achievable in code. p

Negative 263 pI wrote an Android application with a UI based on the tab host, consisting of 3 tabs. Each tab consists of some UI elements, mainly text amp image views.p  pThe problem Im experiencing is as follows When running the application the first time it works fine. If I dont switch tabs, just click the back button to close the application and then run it again it works fine. If I switch to a different tab amp back to the first one, and then click back to close the application  when I run it again the first tab view appears corrupted. Meaning, one of the images Im using as a background of the view doesnt appear and instead I get a few gray horizontal lines with a black background along the whole view. All other tabs views that use the same image as background btw appear fine. All following executions of the application remain corrupted.p  pThis is also an inconsistent behavior, and not related to the specific background image Im using it still happens even when I remove it completely from the application. Another thing Ive tried is to switch between the first problematic tab view and the second one. When I did that the problem did not repeat itself.p  pIt smells to me like a problem in the code generation of the R.java file, but I have no idea whats wrong.p  pDoes anyone have any idea whats the

Negative 263 pI have created a very simple calendar user control that contains a public property which is used to define which monthyear to display.  My calendar control is placed inside another ascx control the wrapper control essentially, which includes LinkButton controls used to toggle the calendar control forward and backward one month at a time.  If I explicitly define the SelectedDateTime property of the calendar control in the wrapper control at design time, the proper monthyear are displayed by the calendar control.  However, when I try to set the property value at run time using a Click event on the previous and next LinkButton controls, the calendar control never picks up the new SelectedDateTime value I try to assign to it.p  pWhen I run the code in debug mode, the Click event of the LinkButton always happens last  after the value of the SelectedDateTime property of the calendar control has already been set to default and rendered.

Negative 263 pSo, say you have a base class which is recursive e.g. a linked list and a derived class as well. The derived class should reuse the constructor from the base class, because you dont want to write redundant code. You could try the obvious thing, and it wont workp  precodeclass Base  public       Baseint size        if size lt 0  next  NULL        else  next  new Basesize  1             void print         cout ltlt  Base         if next  NULL  nextgtprint        protected      Base next  class Derived public Base  public      Derivedint size  Basesize        void print                     cout ltlt  Derived             if next  NULL              nextgtprint           int main        Derived d25      d2.print      cout ltlt n      return 0  codepre  pThis wont work  when you instantiate Derived, it constructs one Derived instance, then calls the Base class constructor which pumps out Base instance after Base instance. If you run main youll getp  precodeDerived  Base   Base   Base   Base   Base  codepre  pNow, you can get smart and use something like the following design pattern a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCuriouslyrecurringtemplatepatternhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCuriouslyrecurringtemplatepatterna which will solve all your problems.

Negative 263 pIm designing a multithreaded server with a thread pool.  This system is designed to use persistent TCP connections, as clients will maintain connects close to 247.  The problem I run into is how to manage shutdowns.  Currently, a connection comes in through acceptlistenfd.... and gets assigned to a work order struct.  This struct is dumped onto the work queue, and is picked up by a thread.  From this point on, this thread is devoted to the current connection.  My code inside the thread isp  precode Function which runs in a thread to handle a request  void  handlereq void in    ssizet n   char read    Convert the input to a workorderptr    workordert workorderptr  workordert in    while servshutdown         ampamp nrecvworkorderptrgtsockfd,ampread,1,0  0        printfRead a character cn,read      printfPeer has shutdown.n     Free the workorder memory    closeworkorderptrgtsockfd   freeworkorderptr   return NULL  codepre  pWhich simply listens to the socket and echos the characters indefinitely, and operates correctly when the client terminates the connection.  You see the servshutdown part in the while loop  this is my attempt to get the thread to break out of its loop on a shutdown signal.  When a SIGINT is caught, the global variable is set to 1.  Unfortunately, the program is currently blocking on the recv statement, and wont check this flag until another character is read.  I want to avoid that, since it could be an arbitrary amount of time before another character is sent on this connection.p  pAlso, I read on another post here that its better to use select than accept to wait on a socket connection, but I didnt quite understand.  Would you do a select to wait, and then do an accept right after that  Im not sure how select creates a socket connection.  I ask this, because if my understanding of select is cleared up, maybe it applies to the question I am askingp  pAlso also, how do I detect the case where a connection simply times out  p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong I think I may have finally found a solution, after further diggingp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2486335wakeupthreadblockedonacceptcallWake up thread blocked on accept callap  pBasically, I could create a global pipe and have each thread do a select on its own socketfd as well as this global pipe.  Then, when a signal is caught, Ill just write something to the pipe.  All threads should be woken, nop

Ive been trying MeshLab for instance, which works great for displaying point cloud data in simple ascii formats, but I couldnt decide in which compatible format to export my other types of geometry, to superimpose on the point cloud layer.p  pHere are the requirements for my whole pipelinep  ul liThe point cloud data may contain millions of points, stored as simple xyz ascii coordsli liThe modeling primitives are primarily lines and cylinders i.e. no polygons, numbered in the thousandsli liThe visualization tool should ideally be crossplatform it must run at least on Linuxli liThere should be a Python module for easy data importexport of the chosen file format or the format is simple enough to write a simple converter, if notli ul  pIve been googling a lot about this so I have tentative answers for all of these, but none that is 100 satisfying in my context. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.. many thanks in advancep
Negative 263 pI was going through the hibernate tutorial and noticed that in every dao you have to get session,begin transaction.Perform all operations and then commitp  precodeprivate void createAndStoreEventString title, Date theDate          Session session  HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory.getCurrentSession         session.beginTransaction          Perform operations...          session.getTransaction.commit       codepre  pThen i have noticed in a framework called Appfuse which uses hibernate have dao methods as shown below.I dont see the begintransaction and commitp  precode    public ListltPersongt findByLastNameString lastName      begintransaction         return getHibernateTemplate.findfrom Person where lastName, lastName     Commit      codepre  pI wonder how appfuse is wrapping up the dao operations with session.beginTransaction and session.getTransaction.commitp  pBy using this technique the programmer doesnt have to bother about hibernate transaction stuff.I want it in such a a way that even if dao methods are overridden the transaction wrapper code should automatically come. I have tried passing dao to a decorator class and wrapping the dao method call inside decorator class.But since the dao interface methods will change,the idea dint worked.How exactly we can achieve this.   p

Negative 263 pI have a mostly complete android application that is exhibiting some odd behavior when contacting my servers. First thing to know is the environment. There are several devices on the network that provide constant udp media streams. They do not appear to be overloading the network in any way. The phone connects to the wifi network and does some data monitoring and reports information back to two different servers, both of which are under my control. The two servers are on completely different domains. The router is a brand new linksys wireless N router with stock firmware.p  pSo the problem is that after the android does the necessary evaluation of the media streams which requires connection to the network, though not to the internet it has recently started to have severe problems contacting the servers. It usually connects to one but throws java.net.UnknownHostException Host is unresolved for the other. This continues for a random amount of time generally several minutes and through several application restarts. After some time of this repeating error it will start working for both servers, or flip which ones are working, or do several other random things. To make it more confusing, several phones in the same room doing the same operation all usually see a different combination of the servers all, one or the other, or none with no obvious Rhyme or reason.p  pUp until recently this has not been a problem, but through review of the code shows that the part that actually contacts the servers hasnt changed in form, so in theory this means it should still work fine. My only clues are that another network with a similar setup, just less media streaming devices and a simpler, less used internet connection, has less problems. This fact is making me start to think that putting DDWRT on the router might make it behave better if the udp traffic is throwing it for a loop. Another idea for these bizarre errors is that somehow changing to the wifi network messes up the DNS tables and they arent refreshed or something silly like that. Though this wouldnt really make sense because I am testing on several Devices with differing Os versions, plus things were working well a while ago.p  pAnyways, I really dont expect someone to know the answer to this since it is such a random issue, but I thought it couldnt hurt to post it, and at least get the opportunity to write my thoughts down for better review. But if anyone has any ideas how to handle these random network errors or can suggest other places to look for problems, I would be very thankful.p  pThanks ahead of time,  Jessy Diamond Exump

Negative 263 pWe recently released a game on the Android Market and its about 41MB in size.  We received reports that users of some devices are unable to install the app though sadly it still allows them to purchase it.p  pResearching the issue we found that these devices have some sort of cache limit applied to downloads from the Google Market and our app is larger than that limit.p  pBased on reports these are the limits weve so far determinedp  ul liSamsung Galaxy S1, Galaxy Tab 7, and Captivate running Android 2.2 have a 30MB limitli liHTC DesireSHD running Android 2.2 has a 40MB limitli ul  pApparently this restriction only applies to the Google Market because Amazon users can download the game without issue and it runs fine on the devices themselves tested with no problems.p  pLooking for a solution to this barrier. The suggestion I keep hearing is to split up the assets and download them separately after install. That seems messy but Ill be forced to go that route unless someone has a better idea.p

Everything I read about the unit of work pattern has it side by side with the repository pattern. So this is the approach Id like to use. p  pSay for example I create a new User. On my unit of work object, I have a list of newly created objects, so I add my new User to this list. My user repository has a method titled Create, which takes in a User and calls a stored procedure to add the data to the database. When I call commit on my unit of work, how will it know which repository and method to call based on the list of new objects Say it contains a User object and a Comment object. Both are newly created and need to be added on commit. Im uncertain how to accomplish this.p  pCould somebody explain this a bit better and maybe even a small example if possiblep  pThanks.p

Im using an idle function to calculate the next direction and shape of the path, but for some reason the idle function is not being called by glutIdleFunc. I checked this with visual studios debugger and having it step through each line of code. When the debugger gets to the glutIdleFuncidle, it just skips over it rather than going into the function.p  pA previous build had idle getting called, but the logic in it was not right, so I had to completely rewrite the idle function. I did get rid of some global variables that I no longer needed with my new logic, but I dont think they should have affected whether or not idle gets called.p  pThis is the main that calls glutIdleFunc.p  precodeltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltlt main gtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgt void mainint argc, char argv    glutInitampargc, argv           initialize the toolkit   glutInitDisplayModeGLUTSINGLE  GLUTRGB  set the display mode   glutInitWindowSize640,480      set the window size   glutInitWindowPosition100, 150  set the window position on the screen   glutCreateWindowMaze  open the screen windowwith its exciting title   glutDisplayFuncmyDisplay      register the redraw function   myInit      glutIdleFuncidle   IDLE FUNCTION IS CALLED HERE   glutMainLoop             go into a perpetual loop   codepre  pHere is the idle functionp  precode void idle   int c  holds column value for square  int r  holds row value for square   ifdone  false ampamp justvisited.empty        initialize random seed      srand  timeNULL         randomly select first maze square indices       c  rand  numcol  1       r  rand  numrow  1    else ifdone  false        set c and r to index values for last       accessed block      c  justvisited.top.col      r  justvisited.top.row       vectorltsquaregt possiblepaths      bool openpath  false     will set to true if there is an untouched adjacent square to move to        will not exit loop until an open path is found or the maze has been completed      whileopenpath  true  done  true            if statements check each adjacent square to see if they are possiblepaths           if they are then they get put into possible paths vector for access later          ifmap[r][c].north  true ampamp map[r1][c].east  true ampamp map[r1][c].north  true ampamp map[r1][c1].east  true              possiblepaths.pushbackmap[r1][c]              openpath  true                     ifmap[r][c].east  true ampamp map[r][c1].east  true ampamp map[r][c1].north  true ampamp map[r1][c1].north  true              possiblepaths.pushbackmap[r][c1]              openpath  true                     ifmap[r1][c].north  true ampamp map[r1][c].east  true ampamp map[r2][c].north  true ampamp map[r1][c1].east  true              possiblepaths.pushbackmap[r1][c]              openpath  true                     ifmap[r][c1].north  true ampamp map[r][c1].east  true ampamp map[r][c2].east  true ampamp map[r1][c].north  true              possiblepaths.pushbackmap[r][c1]              openpath  true                     ifopenpath  if no direction around current square is open, backtrack in maze                  justvisited.pop  pop last off the stack                   ifjustvisited.empty  if stack is empty then the maze is done                       done  true                                      set and c and r to new square values                  c  justvisited.top.col                  r  justvisited.top.row                end of while loop      ifdone ampamp openpath          choose a direction to go         int dir  rand  possiblepaths.size           ifpossiblepaths[dir].col gt c             map[c][r].east  false             justvisited.pushmap[c1][r]                  else ifpossiblepaths[dir].col lt c             map[c1][r].east  false             justvisited.pushmap[c1][r]                  else ifpossiblepaths[dir].row gt r             map[c][r].north  false             justvisited.pushmap[c][r1]                  else ifpossiblepaths[dir].row lt r             map[c][r1].north  false             justvisited.pushmap[c][r1]                end of if statement      glutPostRedisplay      end of if statement    end of idle codepre  pCan anyone help me out What am I missing doing wrong that idle isnt getting calledp  pAlso Im having trouble pasting code into here from visual studios, the formatting gets super messed up.

Negative 263 pIm having trouble trying to figure out a way to return a GeoPoint with the longitude and latitude of the location the user just touched.  I have seen and read tons or examples that display the longitude and latitude in a toast by overriding codedispatchTouchEventcode.  I believe this wont work for my case for the following reason.  p  pI want the user to be able click a button that will then call another method that will return a geopoint on the users next tap. So, in short, a geopoint is only returned on the tap after the user clicks the button.p  pThe only work around I can see using the codedispatchTouchEventcode is the following.p  pIf the button has been clicked, write to the shared preferences. Then in codedispatchTouchEventcode check to see if the button has been clicked. If it has not been clicked,do nothing. If it has been clicked write the longitude and latitude to shared preferences and then read them from shared preferences and create a GeoPoint out of them in a different method.p  pI dont feel like that is a very elegant idea. I feel like there should be a much cleaner way of doing thislike somehow returning just a geopointp  pI hope this makes a little bit of sense.  Ill try to answer any questions I can.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 263 pIm building a project using Xcode 4.2 and Im also using the Storyboard. So basically, I have a UINavigationcontroller which is my initial view, connected to my Main Menu view. Inside my Main Menu I have a button that is linked to  a  tabbar controller, which has like 20  tabs. Therefore, a More button appears and when the more button is clicked an edit button appears. Everything works fine, but the only problem I have is that once I click edit, the configure page slides up and the done button is hidden behind the Navigation bar. Anyway I can the configure page slide up infront of the Navigation bar  p  pAlso, I used the Xcode 4.2s new feature. Where you can Embed in NavigationController and Embed in TabbarController under the Editor Toolbar. Thank you  p

Negative 263 pIm attempting to estimate the total amount of results for app engine queries that will return large amounts of results.p  pIn order to do this, I assigned a random floating point number between 0 and 1 to every entity.  Then I executed the query for which I wanted to estimate the total results with the following 3 settingsp  pre   I ordered by the random numbers that I had assigned in ascending order   I set the offset to 1000   I fetched only one entity pre  pI then plugged the entitiess random value that I had assigned for this purpose into the following equation to estimate the total results since I used 1000 as the offset above, the value of OFFSET would be 1000 in this casep  pre 1  RANDOM  OFFSET pre  pThe idea is that since each entity has a random number assigned to it, and I am sorting by that random number, the entitys random number assignment should be proportionate to the beginning and end of the results with respect to its offset in this case, 1000. p  pThe problem I am having is that the results I am getting are giving me low estimates.  And the estimates are lower, the lower the offset.  I had anticipated that the lower the offset that I used, the less accurate the estimate should be, but I thought that the margin of error would be both above and below the actual number of results.p  pBelow is a chart demonstrating what I am talking about.  As you can see, the predictions get more consistent accurate as the offset increases from 1000 to 5000.  But then the predictions predictably follow a 4 part polynomial. y  5E15x4  7E10x3  3E05x2  0.3781x  51608.p  pAm I making a mistake here, or does the standard python random number generator not distribute numbers evenly enough for this purposep  pThanksp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comv5mVZ.gif altenter image description herep  pstrongEditstrongp  pIt turns out that this problem is due to my mistake.  In another part of the program, I was grabbing entities from the beginning of the series, doing an operation, then reassigning the random number.  This resulted in a denser distribution of random numbers towards the end.p  pI did a little more digging into this concept, fixed the problem, and tried it again on a different query so the number of results are different from above.  I found that this idea can be used to estimate the total results for a query.  One thing of note is that the error is very similar for offsets that are close by.  When I did a scatter chart in excel, I expected the accuracy of the predictions at each offset to cloud.  Meaning that offsets at the very begging would produce a larger, less dense cloud that would converge to a very tiny, dense could around the actual value as the offsets got larger.  This is not what happened as you can see below in the cart of how far off the predictions were at each offset.  Where I thought there would be a cloud of dots, there is a line instead.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgbQJd.gif altenter image description herep  pThis is a chart of the maximum after each offset.  For example the maximum error for any offset after 10000 was less than 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXWrQ8.gif altenter image description herep

Negative 263 pI want to describe my idea first, check the fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netAs7Hz6 relnofollowhereap  pThere are two divs, left and right, left has a fixed width and both are floated left. Container division has no fixed width and can be resized in my design. The requirement is that right cannot be shifted to next line. Width of right will be automatically adjusted to the container division and overflow text will be hidden. All of the three divisions have fixed height.p  pIn the fiddle mentioned above, I set right 50 width to make it adjusted, which is not that perfect. The container division may not be full and shifting problem still occurs.p  pI can implement the layout with javascript to adjust the width of right, but is there any css solution with the help of minwidth or anything elsep  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 263 pIm working on my second ruby program and am stuck on literally the last thing standing between me and a completed program.  My task is to write a Rock, Paper, Scissors Method that returns the winning player.  To do this it takes a game argument in the form of [[Dave,S], [Dan,R]], where S and R are Scissors and Rock respectively.  It then determines the winner and returns the array that contained the winning strategy.  Also Raises Errors if game is wrong length or strategies are  or not in range.p  precodeclass WrongNumberOfPlayersError lt StandardError  end class NoSuchStrategyError lt StandardError  end   def rpsgamewinnergame  raise WrongNumberOfPlayersError unless game.length  2    Hash of whose Keys are the strategies and values are the players   playr  game[0].slice1.downcase gt game[0],     game[1].slice1.downcase gt game[1] This fits on the above line in IRB    Collect Strategies in array for comparison   stgys  playr.keys    raise NoSuchStrategyError unless players give strategies in range, no duplicates   raise NoSuchStrategyError unless stgys.select  s s.match [prs] .size  2     determine Winner   case stgys.tos    when p ampamp r      playr[p]    when p ampamp s      playr[s]    when s ampamp r      playr[r]   end end codepre  pThis works as I expect, checking the strategies against the regexes and returning the winner.  Except the last case, where when met always returns nil.  If I call player[r] under either of the other whens it succeeds, and it returns the right player in p ampamp r.  If I change the order, it still doesnt work so I know it doesnt have to do with its position.  The regex r evaluates when it should if I make a separate match call outside the case statement.  So I believe Ive narrowed it down to something to do with how s and r relate but otherwise Im stumped.  Also any help with DRYness is appreciated, Thanks for the Helpp

Negative 263 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq6317367269126MSDN is a huge hierarchical doc site.ap  pTo be more precise, the content is organized in a hierarchical manner, but the URLs are not. The URL space is flat, making it look like everything is in the same directory.

Because that will be all of MSDN. Too much for your hard drive and bandwith.p  pBut you could write a script that looks at the DOM HTML to then follow and download only those links contained in certain navigational sections of the document, like those of CSS codeclasscode attribute codetocchildrencode and codetocsiblingscode, but not codetocparentcode.p  pWhat youd need would be some downloader that allows you to sayp  precodewebclientgtaddlinks xpathexpression   or webclientgtaddlinks cssselector  codepre  pIt shouldnt be too difficult to cobble something together using Perl, LWP and XMLLibXML HTML parser, but maybe you know of a tool that allows you to do just that so I dont need to reinvent it.p  pIt doesnt have to be Perl, any other language is fine, too, and so is a readymade program that has the flexibility required for this job.p

Negative 263 pOn my C Winform VS 2010  C  .Net 3.5, I have created a button in the designer.  I want to move and resize that button to a different location based on a users setting upon startup of that form.p  pIn my forms load event, I have the following code to move and resize the buttonp  precodebtnShare.Location  new System.Drawing.Point16, 496 btnShare.Margin  new System.Windows.Forms.Padding4 btnShare.Size  new System.Drawing.Size408, 126 codepre  pAll of the code to create the button is  .designer.cs file for this particular form.p  pThe problem is this  When the form loads, I can see the button in its new location based on the 3 lines of code above.  But then when the form is done loading and going through all its events, the button goes back to its original location which is in the .designer.cs InitalizeComponent method.p  pI do not want to take the code out of the .designer.cs file and put it only into the forms .cs file because I still want to be able to see the button in the designer when I work on the design of the form.p  pI just want to move and resize the button if the user has that option toggled upon loading of the form.p  pHow can I do this since .Net seems to draw the buttons on my form after the load event has processed thus moving the button back to its original spotp

Negative 263 pI started to create my HTMLCSS layout based on a hrefhttpmatthewjamestaylor.comblogperfect3column.htm relnofollowthisa article and was moreless successful. However, I think that I messed up somewhere with my css, since this page is not displayed in the same way in IE or ChromeFirefox... p  pBasically, my idea is to have 3 equalwidth columns, with 100 height. Content of each column should have some padding on left, top and right sides, and main links should be positioned in the bottom of each column, aligned in center of its column.p  pThis is the sketch of my layoutp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKeDs5.gif altenter image description herep  pYou can see my current result a hrefhttpwww.krljaustvari.hrtest relnofollowherea. If you look this page in ChromeFirefox you can see that content codedivscode are bleeding out of my page, however, in IE content codedivscode fit nicely I put border on content codedivscode for testing purposes only. I dont believe that IE is rendering my CSS correctly, rather I believe that Im doing something wrong with my CSS, but really not sure what. Thanks for any help on this.p
Negative 263 pI would like to build a Bayesian Network in clojure, since I havent found any similar project. I have studied a lot of theory of BN but still I cant see how implement the network I am not what people call guru for anything, but especially not for functional programming.p  pI do know that a BN is nothing more than a DAG and a lot probability table one for each node but now I have no glue how to implement the DAG.p  pMy first idea was a huge set the DAG with some little maps the node of the DAG, every map should have a name probably a key a probability table another map  a vector of parents and finally a vector of strongnonstrongdescendant.  Now I dont know how to implement the reference of the parents and nondescendants what I should put in the two vector. I guess that a pointer should be perfect, but clojure lack of it I could put in the vector the name of the other node but it is gonna be slow, doesnt it p  pI was thinking that instead of a vector I could use more set, in this way would be faster find the descendants of a node.p  pSimilar problem for the probability table where I still need some reference at the other nodes.p  pFinally I also would like to learn the BN build the network starting by the data this means that I will change stronga lotstrong both probability tables, edge, and nodes.  Should I use mutable types or they would only increment the complexity p  pDoes anybody have any suggestion p  pThanks a lot anyway.p
Negative 263 pI  have implemented a search bar and index capability for my table view. Working well. However, I noticed that when I click in the search bar, the index is still available and clicking on it causes unpredictable results. Rather than debug that, I thought it would be simpler to hide the index p  pI found references elsewhere to calling codesectionIndexTitlesForSectionViewcode and returning nil. So, when I click in the search box, in codesearchBarTextDidBeginEditingcode I have made an explicit call to code[self sectionIndexTitlesForSectionView[self tableView]]code. p  pThe result is that codesectionIndexTitlesForSectionViewcode does get invoked and return nil, but the index is still present.p  pAny ideassuggestions would be greatly appreciated Tony.p

Negative 263 pIm learning RoR nowadays and came up with an idea of creating a very simple content management system.

Negative 263 pIm trying to render a line graph using MSChart from C with a dashed style to the line.  I have no problems setting the style but I have a large amount of data.  This causes the dashed rendering to go wrong as it seems to restart the dash sequence as it draws every line segment.  As such I get a line that looks identical to the solid line.  If i zoom right in such that my data point density reduces then the dashed style becomes visible.p  pThis is no good for me as I really need it to keep the dashing at any zoom level.  Has anyone any ideas as to how this might be possible  It seems strange that it messes up rendering like this to me ...p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 263 pIs it possible to send APDU to the NFC reader for example ACR1222L using javax.smartcardio without actual card connected  As per my API investigation, you can send APDU only using CardChannel which you get from Card and that you get from connect on CardTerminal. However, if you try to connect when no card in NFC reader, you get CardException. On some readers, peripherals are controlled using standard APDUs. This way it seems you cannot control any peripheral of the ACR1222 prior card is presented. Or am I missing something in javax.smartcardio p

Negative 263 pWhich registers are saved across emsyscallsem not function calls, the actual roundtrip to kernelspace via the codesyscallcode instruction on LinuxMIPSp  pJudging from the codeRESTORESOMEcode macro in the codearchmipsincludeasmstackframe.hcode header, it looks like r2r7, r25, r28, and r31 are restored, and of course calleesaved registers are automatically preserved by the calling convention even in kernelspace any kernelspace function thats going to use them will save them itself before clobbering them.

The thing is my child frame is statically configured with a splitter window with two views, a form and a list view, in the OnCreateClient method.  Id like to keep this as the default tab that appears when the app is launched.p  pI have a third view editview with its own document template, which Id like to be able to open as a separate tab.  I will have other views that will behave this way.  Whats the best way to approach thisp  pWill I need to create separate child frames for each view  Will I lose the tab feature if I create separate child frames  p  pOr will I have to modify the child frames OnCreateClient method to test which document template is the current one and create the view for that doc template  Id like to know how some of you seasoned programmers have had or would do it.p  pThanks.p

Negative 263 pIm working on a web application which allows the user to edit elements on a page much like you can do with Adobe InDesign. Objects can be dragged, selected and the user is provided with a sidebar which contains all properties of the object that can be modified.p  pThe data is stored on the server in a database. Im using emDjangoem with emtastypieem to provide a simple REST interface to the data in the database.p  pBasically the data is structured as followsp  ul liDocument ul liPage ul liPage Objectsli ulli ulli ul  pIve done some tests with jQuery and jQueryUI, which provide most of the code needed to allow object selection, dragdrop, etc. All good.p  pNow Im considering what the best way is to storemanagepullupdate the information about all those objects on the page. I could do it all by hand, and use codejQuery.ajaxcode and store information in arrays, dictionaries and link them to DOM elements. However, I feel there is quite a bit of reinventing the wheel and boilerplate code involved that could be avoided.p  pSo I searched the web and came across Backbone.js. It reminds me a bit of Djangos ORM and seemingly makes it simpler to manage all the data. As far as I understand the idea of Backbone.js it allows me to create a object class similar to that defined in the models on the server and use that to store all the information about an object.p  pWould it be suitable to use Backbone.js for this task Ive looked through its documentation and also saw it has support for doing the synchronization using RESTAjax.p

Negative 263 pIm using Angulars coderesourcecode to fetchupdate my Project objects, a simplified version looks like thisp  precode     id 12345,     name whatever,     revisions [          id 67890,           comments [                 id 13579, body heres a comment            ]           codepre  pSo each Project contains an array of Revision objects, which contain an array of Comment objects, and I have an ID for each.p  pMy application is useless without the whole project object, so it seems like the most efficient thing to do is to request the Project only once when the page loads.  Lets say I wanted to update or add a Revision which is an array of child objects, I emthinkem the ideal situation would be that I could locate that Revision object and then call codesavecode on it.  The problem is that the child objects of the Project do not inherit the functions that coderesourcecode gives to the root Project object.  p  pI realize that I could just update the Revision object in my scope and then call codesavecode on the Project, but my app requires a very specific behavior when Revisions are created, that is different from when Projects are updated, that is different from when Comments are created, etc.p  pI know that I could create a new type of coderesourcecode called Revision and give it its own unique URL, but in order to update that object, I will need to have requested it in the first place inefficient, right.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on how I should go about solving this problem  Am I better off using codehttpcode than coderesourcecodep

Negative 263 pI have developed many desktop applications in Swing, even those a bit more complex, with Hibernate and Spring integration. I found out that many things repeats and should be done quickly and in convenient way, like application lifecycle, logging, alerts, authorisation, forms and their validation. I started looking for frameworks. I met Swing Application Framework which is dead since several years, as it turned out. Spring RCP really met with my expectations, especially creating forms basing on Java Bean model is what I liked, but I realised it is dead too. Netbeans RCP is not for me, I am using Eclipse and I dont want to use another IDE for desktop development. I am not really excited about Eclipse RCP, I got feeling that it is too Eclipse oriented, I would prefer something low coupled to any tool, besides it is not so straightforward to learn. p  pI am surprised that there is so weak support for developing desktopbased business applications in Java. Its like Java was only used in web environment. What is the preferred language for making such apps then And if I want to stay with Java, is there a chance to find something similar to Spring RCP so far I couldntp

Negative 263 pI was unable to find a way how to install certificates on my iPad to a keychain using iTunes or other tool that runs on mac os x.p  pI need to be able to set the group codekSecAttrAccessGroupcode, eg. codeXKFABCDEFGH.com.mycompany.myappcode to store the certificate under. Since there is a chain of certificates, Ill be installing all of them up to the root one. Also, the last leaf certificate will have private part dont know if that makes any difference.p  pThe alternative to this is to write a small app and compile the certificates as its resources. Then I can use SecItemAdd  SecItemUpdate to write those certificates. Downside to this is that I want to install different certificate on every device, so Ill have to compile the app several different times.p  pNote The app is to be a B2B, eg. not an application for public iTunes market p  pEdit I want to use the certificates a hrefhttpallseeingi.comASIHTTPRequestHowtouse relnofollowASIHTTPRequesta, I do not require that those certificates are recognized by the iOS itself unless it will collide with the ASIHTTPRequest library.p

Negative 263 pOver the last few months I have become familiar with OAuth2.0 authorization within google apps script but a recent anomaly has me confuzzled. I have a standalone webapp that acts as a frontend to a fusion table. The webapp is set to execute as the script and fusion table owner and the fusion table grants view access to external users. The program detects authorization, prompts if needed, and uses refresh tokens if theyre available. When run from the account that owns the script and fusion table, all is well.p  pOnce I published the webapp, I tested it from an external account and it worked fine. The refresh token was then removed from the scriptowners UserProperties. When the app was run again from an external account, it prompted for authorization and authorized correctly saving the new tokens in the UserProperties of the scriptowner. However, the next POST call to the API received a 403Forbidden error. At this point the app will continue to receive 403Forbidden errors from any account including the scriptowners account until the tokens are manually cleared and reauthorized as the scriptowner.p  pWhy is it that these tokens are not valid I would expect that since the app is being executed as the scriptfusion owner, any tokens received programmatically would be as valid as those those authorized by the scriptfusion owner. If my expectations are incorrect, how can I protect against this situation for multiple usersp  h1Updateh1  pIve gained some more traction on this and have identified some related issues that I wanted to share here. First of all, I was manually deleting the tokens refresh and access to test the ability of the app to authorize. Subsequent authorizations were not returning a refresh token which caused excessive prompting. I found out that this is an intentional outcome from the google API. Aside from the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsOAuth2WebServeroffline relnofollowrequisite request parametersa to return a refresh token, I found out that a refresh token is only returned on the first userprompt and authorizationa hrefhttpgooglecode.blogspot.com201110upcomingchangestooauth20endpoint.html relnofollowref. herea. In order to get another refresh token, you need to either a hrefhttpsaccounts.google.comb0IssuedAuthSubTokenshlen relnofollowrevokeacessa and reauthorize or a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsOAuth2WebServerformingtheurl relnofollowforce the approval prompta in the request. Once I fixed that it became much clearer that the token was attached to the user making the initial authorization request. As long as I retained the refresh token acquired by the scripttable owner, then the script could be used and reauthorized programmatically using the refresh token by any external user. Which brings me back to the point. If I lose the refresh token, I need to manually delete all remaining token scraps, login as scripttable owner, revoke access to the app, then reauthorize.p  pPer Zigs answer below, that is just how it is. Is there no way I can programmatically prevent that very manual processp

Negative 263 pIve reviewed the Matplotlib APIs and Im either misunderstanding something or overthinking this.  I have a collection of data representing a polar coordinate and some estimation factor each datum in the file can be described as p  precodeMag, Ang, Factor m1, ang1, f1 m2, ang2, f2 etc... codepre  pI want to make a 3D surface or at very least some kind of color map that will describe this data.  Ultimately, the image should look like an arc from a topdown view, with a way to discern these estimation factors along the zaxis.  My initial attempts at trying to flip this to some sort of Cartesian format did not help much as this forced me to represent Cartesian points not represented in the data, and therefore was unable to assign some meaningful zcoordinate in the corresponding matrix.p  pThank you for your time and attentionp
Negative 263 pI have a socket connection, and I am sending data through this socket. The server I am connected to answers every correct send of my data. Ive got the message working so I get an answer for every message I receive. Sometimes the server likes to hold onto a message for a few seconds, or send in different order. My solution was to spawn a thread and have it spin around a receive function. However using the Sockets example on MSDN I am having fits. They use a simple dowhile looping structure. When I do this I get jumbled replies, andor incomplete data. This is for a homework assignment so I have to write the client by hand rather than just use an easier solution.

Negative 263 pI have a project with several MIDL files, which VS ALWAYS recompiles despite them being unchanged. Ive tried several tips, including putting the project dir in include path etc. but nothing helps. Problem is that there are header files generated that then affect the recompilation of other subprojects, incurring an unneccesary rebuild of components.p  pAny workaround for this  I even tried using a Custom Build Tool with midl.exe, and this normally works for other types of issues, but using midl.exe exhibits the same exact behaviour, i.e the MIDL always being recompiled.p  pKind of frustrating...p

The goal is for the user to user the custom picker to select an hour  minute second to record for their time spent on a run etc.....   p  pMy main question here is simply how do I make my custom picker appear when the textfield is clicked, i know I am missing something in the implementation for the picker itself, perhaps this custom picker doesnt follow the default methods for componentrows I know the date one I was using before didnt need those.

Negative 263 pConditional variables use a mutex and the .wait function unlocks the mutex so another thread can access the shared data. When the condition variable is notified it tries to lock the mutex again to use the shared data.p  pThis pattern is used in the following concurrentqueue example from a hrefhttpwww.justsoftwaresolutions.co.ukthreadingimplementingathreadsafequeueusingconditionvariables.html relnofollowAnthony Williamsap  precodetemplatelttypename Datagt class concurrentqueue  private     boostconditionvariable theconditionvariable public     void waitfordata              boostmutexscopedlock lockthemutex         whilethequeue.empty                      theconditionvariable.waitlock                   void pushData constamp data              boostmutexscopedlock lockthemutex         bool const wasemptythequeue.empty         thequeue.pushdata         ifwasempty                      theconditionvariable.notifyone                codepre  pSince the code uses stdqueue its clear that the mutex has to be locked when accessing the queue. But lets say instead of stdqueue one uses a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee355358.aspx relnofollowMicrosofts Concurrencyconcurrentqueuea from PPL. Member functions like empty, push and trypop are thread safe. Do I still need to lock a mutex in this case or can the condition variable be used like this, without creating any possible race conditions.p  pMy code that seems to work, but what does that mean in multithreading looks like this. I have one producer that pushes items into Microsofts concurrentqueue and one background thread that waits for new items in this queue.p  pThe consumerbackground threadp  precodewhilerunFlag atomic      whilethequeue.empty ampamp runFlag wait only when thread should still run              boostmutex mtx local mutex thats locked afterwards. awkward.         boostmutexscopedlock lockmtx         condition.waitlock           Data d     whilethequeue.empty ampamp thequeue.trypopd             process data       codepre  pThe producermain threadp  precodeconst bool wasempty  thequeue.empty Data d  thequeue.pushd ifwasempty condvar.notifyone codepre  pThe shutdown procedurep  precodebool expectedrunstate  true ifrunLoop.compareexchangestrongexpectedrunstate, false      atomically set our loop flag to false and      notify all clients of the queue to wake up and exit     condvar.notifyall  codepre  pAs said above this code seems to work but that doesnt necessarily mean its correct. Especially the local mutex that is only used because the condition variable interface forces me to use a mutex, seems like a very bad idea. I wanted to use condition variables since the time between data items added to the queue hard to predict and I would have to create to sleep and wake up periodically like thisp  precodeifthequeue.empty Sleepshortamountoftime codepre  pAre there any other, maybe OS in my case Windows specific tools, that make a background thread sleep until some condition is met without regularly waking up and checking the conditionp

Negative 263 pI understand the difference between primitive setter and nonprimitive setter KVO notifications and all that. But if I write my own setValueforKey and call setPrimitiveValueforKey, do I have to pass it the SAME value I read the documentation, I googled it but I couldnt find any discussion about this at all.p  pEdit Thanks, adpalumbo amp Dave FN. You both agree it doesnt have to be the same value. My real question is this. I write my own setter and getter. I then call the setter on a NSManagedObject to change its primitive value, but because of the way the custom getter is written, its still returning the old value primitive value has been modified. but if you call the custom getter before and after the modification, you will see no change.. After this I call hasChanges on the NSManagedObjectContext and it returns NO If I call save on the context, the change will not be saved at all. Any idea Normal behavior Potential Core Data bugp

I thought that either I would inherit the responsible plugin codeBasicTextFormattercode in this case, or I would create a new plugin, whichever was easier. My assumption was, that all could be achieved via inheritance and I wouldnt need to change Google Closure files.p  pI was able to inherit codegoog.editor.Plugincode and put some dummy debug info to learn about calling it. p  precodegoog.provideproject.LinkPlugin goog.requiregoog.editor.Plugin  project.LinkPlugin  function    goog.editor.Plugin.callthis  goog.inheritsproject.LinkPlugin, goog.editor.Plugin  project.LinkPlugin.prototype.getTrogClassId  function    return projectLinkPlugin   project.LinkPlugin.prototype.isSupportedCommand  functioncommand    console.logis supported   command   return command  myLink   project.LinkPlugin.prototype.execCommandInternal  functioncommand, varargs    console.logexec command   command  codepre  pI registered the plugin. p  precodevar editor  new goog.editor.FieldrtfEditor editor.registerPluginnew project.LinkPlugin editor.registerPluginnew goog.editor.plugins.BasicTextFormatter ...  codepre  pThen I was not sure, how to add my button, so I attempted to do it the ugly way at least for nowp  precodevar buttons  [   ...   goog.editor.Command.FONTSIZE,   myLink,   goog.editor.Command.UNDO,   ... ] var toolbar  goog.ui.editor.DefaultToolbar.makeToolbarbuttons, toolbarDiv codepre  pAnd then I got stuck. The info about the buttons is in codedefaulttoolbar.jscode and I havent found a way of adding my button into codeBUTTONScode array without modifying the GC code. All around is so nicely composite and inheritable, that I feel there must be a way of achieving it. Plus the concept of plugins signals that it should be rather easy and straightforward to add something.p  pAfter googling, all I found was a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netyinhmplugin6345064 relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpsgithub.comshripadkgoogleclosureimageplugin relnofollowthisa. Both approaches require changing GC code.p  pWhat have I missed p  pstrongTLDR versionstrong Is there a clean way of adding my own plugin into the GC editorp  pAnd if it is easier to modify i.e. inherit a plugin instead of adding one, how to do that How to specify, that my codeexecCommandInternalcode should be called, not the original onep  pEdit OK, I found out, that the buttons can be array of strings, but also of codegoog.ui.Controlcode. So this will probably solve this step. Anyway. Ill continue to work on that. Still if someone knows about some link, where all is nicely summarized, or someone did it recently and could summarize it here, I would be greatly grateful.p

Negative 263 pI am creating a TicTacToe game in which a square in the grid is represented by a class called Square which I created. It extends JButton, but I added a boolean field called empressableem which states whether or not the button can be pressed ingame. If the button already has a letter, then it cannot be pressed. I want to implement code in my actionPerformed method that will check the empressableem variable, and if empressableem is false, it will not change the letter of the square. I am using the getSource method on my ActionEvent to give me a reference to the square pressed. Therefore, I need to cast the Object to type Square so that I can access its empressableem field. But when I do this, I get the following error codejava.lang.ClassCastException javax.swing.JButton cannot be cast to tic.tac.toe.Squarecode This makes no sense to me. Before I needed each square to have a empressableem field, I used a JButton, which worked just fine. But since Square inherits JButton, I would think that it would work as well. How can I fix this  p

I want to use my android device Bluetooth functionality which is currently not directly supported by the Qt framework.

Negative 263 pIm working on a project implemented in Python 2.7 with a GUI made with PyQt4.

Negative 263 pI am trying to create a small application that is able to manage errors and send bug reports etc. I am hoping this can be in the form of a button so when the button is pressed, it causes the whole application to crash.p  pI know immediately that most users are reaching for the down arrow button to flag this as a stupid question. However I only wish to make my application crash so that I can see if my application can send bug reports if it does crash therefore helping me develop the program better.p  pThere must be a way of making the application crash and despite a sizeable search on the Internet, I have not been able to find anything. And when I mean crash I mean it stops responding and hopefully brings up the dialogue box looking for a solution.p  pI want to crash my application deliberately to try and develop a way to catch any exceptions and then send them in a bug report on next load up.p  pI dont have anything to give you because I cannot find anything myself and thats why Im here... To ask how do I crash it someone must know. It can be as simple or as complicated as you want. A nice big crash would be very nice though.p

Negative 263 pI downloaded source of GDCM 2.4.1 and used CMake 2.8.12.1 and Visual Studio 2010 to build the libraries. I want to use GDCM in my C project.

Thus, I cant integrate GDCM libaries in my own project I tried to use FindPackageGDCM in my own CMakeproject, but header files cant be found.p  pI do not want to copy the header files manually or target the source directory of GDCM.

Negative 263 pBasically for an assignment I need to create a C program that will take a number as input n then create a 2D array size nn with the numbers 1 to nn. It needs to use a brute force method. I have done this but at the moment the program will just randomly generate the order of the numbers each time, so it will sometimes check the same order more than once. Obviously this means it takes a really long time to check any number above 3, and even for 3 it can take a few minutes. Basically Im wondering if there is any way for me to make it only check each order once. I am only allowed to use basic C functions, so just things like , , ,  and nothing like .Shuffle etc.  p
Negative 263 pIm having some trouble writing to multiple databases using phonegap 2.9.0 on android. Everything seems to work fine on iOS and in the ripple emulator but when I use my samsung galaxy S3 and it seems to be the case with other android devices as well I get an error, No such table exists, when trying to write rows to the table.p  pIm parsing a json object to get column names, database names etc. and then sending the data off to be written to a database. I am creating a separate database for each table since there may be a substantial amount of data written to each database.p  pGenerally the first database  table that is written goes successfully, but then although the success callbacks are called for successive create table sql statements and insert statements, when I try to read from the db, I get the error no such table exists TableCategoryClass. All success callbacks fire, both when creating tables and writing rows. But when it comes time to read the db it seems that all tables except for the first one, are not created and that the row insert statements are not writing to any successive tables.p  pI was using a deferred type process to control all the async functions, but I scrapped it and put everything in successerror callbacks to make it easier for me to read and follow.p  pMy code is as followsp  precode

Negative 263 pIm implementing a web service using Azure Cloud Services. The web service needs to... p  ul liaccept input data li lirun a potentially lengthy calculation on the input data li lireturn results of the calculationli ul  pFrom what Ive read, it is recommended that a worker role hosts the calculation, whilst a web role handles the HTTP requestsresponses and a queue is used to pass the input data between the 2 types of role. This architecture allows web roles to be scaled up to meet an increased demand in web traffic andor worker roles to be scaled up to enable parallel processing of results.p  pWhat Im not sure about is the best way to deliver the calculated results back to the client that sent the original HTTP request to the web role. In terms of scalability, is it better to provide an additional web service method that clients can call to return results if they have been processed or is it better to return the results as part of the HTTP response to the original requestp  pIf the latter, what is the most straightforward way to do this using PHPp  pAny advice would be much appreciated.p

Negative 263 pSo, I know scanf isnt the fastest way to read input from stdin, and talking to my teacher other day he said that a simple getchar function till n, to read a line, would be a lot faster than scanf with all its security concerns. So I came up with the following functionp  precodeint readchar s      char tmp  1     unsigned short i     for i0 tmpnampamptmpEOF i          tmp  getchar         s[i]  tmp          if tmpEOF         return 1     return i1  codepre  pIt reads a string till n or EOF is found, as you can see. If EOF is found it returns 1, if it reads correctly till a new line it returns the lenght of the string. Using this function I removed the scanfs, s and also the strlens that I was using to know the lenght of the string read, since now using only the read function I already have this information. The thing is that, after submiting my new solution to the online judge, the running time of my code went from 0.16s to 0.18s. Shouldnt it had been faster Or did I screw up with my read functionp  pBy the way, the problem that I applied this solution to is this  a hrefhttpwww.urionlinejudge.com.brrepositoryUOJ1251en.html relnofollowhttpwww.urionlinejudge.com.brrepositoryUOJ1251en.htmlap

The file structure of the clients SVN repository is sort of a subset of our own file structure  it contains some files and folders, but not all.p  h1Desired Workflowh1  pUltimately, I think Id like to create a branch in our git repository called ClientSVNDelivery.  This branch should reflect the state of the clients SVN repo.  Whenever we want to deliver updates to the client, I would like to codegit mergecode our changes over to that branch from master, and then codegitsvn dcommitcode those changes up to their remote site.p  h1Problemh1  pThe problem Im having, logisticallyspeaking, is the starting point.  Since both repositories have a long, emcompletely unassociatedem history and the folder structure is not identical again, the SVN project is a subset of the folders in our internal git repo, Im not sure how to create the associations needed to set up my ClientSVNDelivery staging branch namely, how to form a common ancestor that would allow a merge to actually work.  To be honest, Im even having trouble describing what I want to dop  pWould I create the branch off of our most recent internal revision  Some arbitrary earlier revision  Or would I branch off of the removesvn history insteadp  h1Questionh1  pHas anyone dealt with this kind of scenario before  Were you able to streamline the process, and what steps did you take to set up your intermediate branch  How did you create the history associationsp

Negative 263 pAssuming I have about 500 rows of data and are within a grid showing 40 rows per page.  I been thinking about how the grid works is that the 500 rows to display the next page with the data correspond. p  pI have 2 options ....  1 The first is that you make a single queryto BD, and keep 500 rows in memory and work from there and cut each time you pass page. p  p2nd Second, run the query to the database, Cut to show the necessary rows and then display. And every time I pass page make a new query, bringing the 500 and go cutting data and showing only what is needed.p  pSo the question is what is the ideal operation that should have a grid to handle the data Making the best use in performance.p

Any help would be most appreciatedp

Negative 263 pIve seen many youtube regex here on StackOverflow and around the web but failed to find or edit the one I need. What I need is to validate user input for a valid youtube url wich should also contain the Youtube pagechannel.

Negative 263 pThis relates to the problem discussed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17114304jaxbunmarshallingnottoleratingwhitespacearoundtokenenumerationsherea.p  pI am having a similar problem with dateTime elements that contain whitespace in front of the dateTime value.

Negative 263 pI am writing an OpenGL game and am about to start writing the code for a Quakelike console a la Quake 2CounterStrike, where you press tilde  and a console interface drops down. I have already used the Haskeline library for a plain textbased console application and would like to incorporate it into my OpenGL app, but am not sure how to go about this.p  pFor example, how would I use the codegetInputLinecode function when the Haskeline REPL loop is in another thread  I am guessing that Id have to use codeforkIOcode and then use file descriptors to simulate UNIXstyle piping to achieve this. Id have to write a bridge function that takes keyboard input with GLFW, then pass it on to Haskeline, have Haskeline do its magic to what it thinks is the STDOUT, then capture this, and then have it displayed on the screen via OpenGL calls. Am I on the right track, or is this approach not the most sensible way to do itp

Negative 263 pWe have a backbone.js application that needs to have a shared context model storing the environmental variables of the application, which can trigger events in multiple views. An easy way to do is to use the same model across multiple views, serving like a global object.

Negative 263 pI have a library where there is a lot of small objects, which now all have virtual functions. It goes to such an extent that the size of the pointer to a virtual function table can exceed the size of the useful data in the object it can often be just a structure with a single codefloatcode in it. The objects are elements in a numerical simulation on a sparse graph, and as such cannot be easily merged  etc.p  pIm not concerned as much about the cost of the virtual function call, rather about the strongcost of the storagestrong. What is happening is that the pointer to the virtual function table is basically reducing the efficiency of the cache. Im wondering if I would be better off with a type id stored as an integer, instead of the virtual function.p  pI cannot use static polymorphism, as all of my objects are in a single list, and I need to be able to perform operations on items, selected by an index which is a runtime value  therefore there is no way to statically determine the type.p  pThe question is is there a design pattern or a common algorithm, that can dynamically call a function from an interface, given a list of types e.g. in a typelist and a type indexp  pThe interface is defined and does not change much, but new objects will be declared in the future by possibly lessskilled users of the library and there should not be a large effort needed in doing so. Performance is paramount.

Negative 263 pAs far as I know, creating an codeNSMutableArraycode with a helper method such as codearrayWithArraycode adds both the array and the mutable array to the current autorelease pool. With codemutableCopycode, the array being copied as added to the autorelease pool but the resulting codeNSMutableArraycode does not. Without ARC, its a notable difference. p  pBut when using ARC, is there any difference beyond what is described above and which is irrelevant with ARC Ive seen code using both ways. Is there an established best practice on how to create mutable versions of immutable objects, when ARC is turned on, and why is it sop

Negative 263 pIve written a small console app that moves backed up databases from one machine to another location via email.p  pHow this works, the machine that the SQL server is on Ive got a job created within SQL that backs up specific databases to a volume storage that is within the same machine but not on the same volume as the Server 2008rC operating system is on.p  pSo, every night about 1am the job runs and backs up specific databases to a volume that Im only using to back up database specific items. Now, every night about 2am Im running a windows task that invokes my console application, this console application is the code below an is very simple. All it does is retrieves the databases, zips them all up into one zip file and then emails the backed up databases to a specific email, and from that point the databases get stored at various locations so that Ive got a little redundancy.p  pHere is my questions.p  p1. What is the minimum amount of permissions that I should set on the Root folder that the backed up databases are being stored in so that the windows task scheduler will be able to invoke my console app, and in turn my console app does read, write, and deletes. I would like the minimum amount of permissions set.p  p2. How to I run the console app by hiding the console window so that if an admin is logged on they do not see that window when the console app is invoked via that windows task scheduler. Now, Ive been told that I can set my application to a windows forms from a console app and this will fix my window issues, but my question to that is does this mean that every day at 2am this will create a new window and the windows stay active In other words I need to run this console app, the console app needs to do what its task is set to do, and I need the console app to complete die out and not be running any longer until 24 hours later at 2am.p  pstrongHere is all the code that creates the zip file, emails the zip file, and the deletes the zip file.

Then, when the user taps a tile, I would be able to check if that tile is next to an empty space and, if so, change the corresponding Tile objects Row and Column properties.  Because of the binding, the tile would then automatically be placed in the right cell in the grid, preferably using a nice sliding animation.  I would like to use this type of solution because I would be able to put all the logic in viewmodel and model classes, instead of in the view.  And it would be similar to the solution I used in my Windows store app, which would allow me to reuse a lot of code.p  pA long intro, but I hope it helps in understanding my questions.  Is it possible to use the MvxGridView for this type of scenario  Or is there a different type of approach you would suggest with MvvmCross that would still allow me to keep the logic in viewmodel and model classes  If its note too much too ask, a few code fragments would be really helpful.p  pI thought it might be possible by setting the androidlayoutcolumn and androidlayoutrow properties for a LinearLayout that is used as an ItemTemplate for an MvxGridView.  I also read about using MvvmCross to bind layoutweight a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21477431howtobindtoviewslayoutweightinmvvmcrossHow to bind to View39s layoutweight in MvvmCrossa However, I cant seem to find a way to access the layoutcolumn and layoutrow properties in the same way.p  pThanks in advance for any help or suggestions you may be able to provide.  I really like how the MvvmCross framework allows me to reuse many of my Windows store app programming skills.  It would be great if I could use it for laying out the tiles in a grid, with or without the use of the MvxGridView.p

Negative 263 pI am running tomcat 7, Ubuntu 14.04, apache 2.4, Java 8.

But when I go to the naked url, I only see the apache folder structure. In my understanding modjk should be forwarding to the ajp port of tomcat instead.p  pI installed apache2 and modjk libapache2modjk by using aptget. It basically did all the configuration for me at least it looks like it did. I followed some tutorials to install it, but basically just checked and made sure the steps were taken. The main apache conf file is called apache2.conf and it includes all the .conf files from the folder called modsenabled. Inside modsenabled, there is a file called jk.conf. This is the modjk conf file and it includes a workers.properties file that is held in my etclibapache2modjk folder. I edited the workers.properties file to point to my tomcat home location and my java homep  pThe one thing that seemed different from most of the tutorials I read was that my mod jk conf file jk.conf had no reference to a file called modulemodjk.so. I dont know what this file is, and why the folder doesnt have a slash in front of it, but that was what it looked like in all the tutorials.p  pWhat would really help is if someone has used the aptget installation of modjk on Ubuntu 14.04 all of the examples I found were for 12.04. p  pIs the reason its not connecting because I dont have the .so file Am I mistaken about how ajp is suppossed to work, do I need to do any extra tomcat configuration other than have an ajp connector that looks like this codeltConnector port8009 protocolAJP1.3 redirectPort8080 gtcodep

Negative 263 pI am new to python and i am trying to scale my processing in parallel. I have a file with certain number of tuples, each with certain value in the last column. I want to split this file data and apply my function in parallel to each chunk. But the thing is to split the data in to chunks based on last column value and apply the function for each chunk. For example, last column may have a for some tuples and b for some and c for some. So in that case, i should get three chunks and process it in parallel. Number of unique values in last column may change depends on dataset, so i need to use the CPU accordingly.p  pQ1 What i tried till now is to read the file and created a dictionary based on that records, so basically three keyvalue pairs for the above one, one with a as key and all records having a as values and the same to b and c. I can make use of chunksize in multiprocessing, but here it is not size, its based on key, so how can i achieve this p  pQ2  After processing the above chunks, i need the output of all together,order does not matter and then i need to use the whole output for further processing, how can i make my main program wait till all those process completep  pLet me know if further input is required. Thanks.p

But when I used apache poi to export it to excel for some reason theres been compilation problems, but I cant see how that might be where the error is being caused.

Negative 263 pImagine I have two branches, one of which has been set up to track one remotetracking branch and another which has similarly been set up to track a emdifferentem remotetracking branch.  Now, lets say I merge these two branches together into a single branch.  How would such a merger affect the resulting branchs connectivity  Would the resulting branch still be able to track both of the remotetracking branches which were tracked by its unmerged predecessors, or would one remotetracking branch no longer be tracked by my new, merged branch  p

Negative 263 pI want to create an iOS app which will have use a Tab Bar controller.

Negative 263 pIve been researching this for the last couple days but havent found a solution yet.

Everything works except the form fields that are drop down lists.  When I run it, it fills in the values I want in those fields but it seems like its not actually selecting them from the list, just overwriting whats displayed there, because when it clicks submit an error window pops up saying to fill in those drop down fields.p  pFrom my research Ive seen various solutions for how to search a drop down list and set it to the selected index once its located the text I want, but my problem is that I havent had luck selecting the drop down list at all.

Negative 263 pI pretty new to VBA. Actually my scenario is little complex to elaborate, so let me start with an example and explain to you what exactly I need. I will be having three worksheets in excel.p  ol lipBase Sheetpli lipCondition Sheetpli lipDestination Sheetpli ol  pBase sheet will be in the below formatp  precode             Column A    Column B   Column C    Column D Row1    Some text1    Some text2    Some text3  SETA Row2    Some text4    Some text5    Some text6   Row3    Some text7    Some text8    Some text9   Row4    Some text10   Some text11   Some text12 SETB Row5    Some text13   Some text14   Some text15  Row6    Some text16   Some text17   Some text18 SETC Row7    Some text19   Some text20   Some text21  Row8    Some text22   Some text23   Some text24  Row9    Some text25   Some text26   Some text27  codepre  pAs you see in the above example. Its showing that first 3 rows are for SETA, next 2 rows are of SETB and next 4 rows are of SETC.  Here in this sheet BASE sheet the column number will be constant, so every time we will be having 4 columns, but the number of rows in each SET and also number of SETs are variable.  Different users can enter different data in to this worksheet. p  pWorksheet 2  Condition sheet will be having multiple rows with 3 constant columns, as shown below.p  precode        Column A        Column B        Column C Row1    SETA                10         Replace text Row2    SETB                 5         Replace text Row3    SETC                 6         Replace text codepre  pMy last worksheet will have an ActiveX button, so when I click that buttonp  ul lipThe macro will first look in to the first row of Condition Sheet, which means use SETA in Base sheet. pli lipCopy the SETA data  pli liPaste in 10 times in destination sheet and then replace some text.  li liThen the 2nd row Condition Sheet, now it uses SETB in Base sheet copy the SETB data and paste in 5 times in destination sheet and then replace some text. li liLikewise, it increments until last row.li ul  pI got the code for this, I am able to successfully achieve what I need. The problem is its predefined, so every time I need to look into Base Worksheet and count how many SETs are there, and how many rows each SET has, then I need to declare it as follows.p  precodeDim seta As Range Dim setb As Range Dim setc As Range    Set seta  Sheet1.RangeA1C3 Set setb  Sheet1.RangeA4C5 Set setc  Sheet1.RangeA6C9 codepre  pCan it be user defined I mean when a user enters the data in Base sheet with multiple SETs and multiple rows in each SET.  VBA should count how many SETs are there and how many rows in each SET and it should dynamically declare seta,setb,setc,etc., as range objects.p  pI know it very long and confusing but kindly ignore my poor questionnaire skills and let me know if any further info is needed.p

Is it And if not, why is it not Why could the dependency on AAA prevent it from being used in a new context Does context here mean with a different classp  pAnd it says that although BBB needs to call the method1, but it doesnt need to know what that method does. So you should weaken the dependency loose coupling by using an interfaceabstract class for AAA instead of AAA itselfp  pSo newp  precodeclass AAA extends AbstractAAA   same    class BBB      AbstractAAA ref      public BBB AbstractAAA param          this.ref  param               public void start          whiletrue              if something                  ref.method1                              class Main          BBB ref  new BBBnew AAA         ref.start  codepre  pAnd now it says that main still depends on BBB and it depends on the constructor of AAA, but BBB is unaffected by the implementation details of AAA.p  pSo dependency means in the broadest sense Uses an instance of, so I see that therefore Main depends on BBB and on AAA and BBB formerly depended on AAA and now on the abstract class, which is a weaker dependency.p  pWhat I dont get is what is the problem exactly with dependencies and implementation details and having to change if another class changes. I get that it is better to use interfaces and abstract classes as parameters of methods and constructors, because you can pass whatever class extendsimplements the classinterface. But the thing with the implementation details. When I have a reference of a class and create a dependency and call a public method, how am I then dependent on implementation details Just because I call that method doesnt mean I know whats going on inside it...p  pI have looked at other examples here on SO but I still dont really get it...p

Negative 263 pSo, Ive had a tiny bit of experience with cPanel and Plesk both, but Im pretty n0013. If I have a Windows PC, I do, do I HAVE to use Pleskp  pLast year I briefly tinkered with a site with cPanel and that was from CHROME OS Of course, the Cpanel was through the cloud, on Godaddy, but it makes me wonder how much operating system even matters for building a site at a basic level if the cloud gets everything done anyway. I heard some figures for the price of Plesk and it sounded more expensive than what I paid for itAt least godaddy SAID I had Plesklike 4070month.  I just canceled it to rearrange domain names that Im working on, but Im pretty sure a whole year of Plesk was in that price range on Godaddy but I never got a download, just a login password to a cloud based thing.p  pAre you supposed to download Plesk in arrangements like that, or not Its ease of use was substantially worseat least less intuitive than my cPanel experience, and cPanel had been cloud based also.p  pI hope this question isnt rambling on too much. There are a lot of gaps in my understanding on this whole thingeven though Ive successfully put up websites beforejust didnt really understand the interface I was working with that well.p  pAnd how does that relate to FTPs Do I have to download that separately I was able to write my own htmlcss and put up a site in the past without even knowing what FTP was so Im not even sure if its something I should be manually controlling.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 263 pIve been writing android apps for some months now, and Im at the point where Im building an actual needed app.p  pAs I want that to work nice and fast, I made a Workerthread to do all kinds of tasks in the background while the UI can...build up and work and stuff.p  pIts based on the Android Studio Drawer app blueprint.p  pIn Main.onCreate I got my codeoperatornew Operatorcode, which extends codeThreadcode.p  pNow, when loading a new Fragment, it sometimes calls codeMainActivity.operator.someMethodcode I made operator static so I can use it from anywhere, and after some time I realized, the only tasks actually running in background are those in the operators coderuncode method and an codeAsynctaskcode my login Fragment runs. Everything else the UI waits for to complete and therefore gets executed by the UI thread.p  pSo I thought no problem My codeoperatorcode gets a codehandlercode which is built in coderuncode, and I change those tasksp  precodepublic void run      Looper.prepare   Android crashed and said I had to call this     OpHandler  new Handler     LoadLoginData     [...Load up some Arrays with hardcoded stuff and compute for later use...]   public void LoadLoginData      OpHandler.postLoadLoginDataRunnable  private Runnable LoadLoginDataRunnable  new Runnable      Override     public void run          ifsharedPreferencesnull             sharedPreferences PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferencescontext         sessionIDsharedPreferences.getStringsessionID, null         ifsessionIDnull              postenID  sharedPreferences.getStringpostenID, PIDSTANDARD             postenName  sharedPreferences.getStringpostenName, PIDSTANDARD             context.QuickToastsessionID, postenName, postenID                codepre  pcontext is my MainActivity, I gave the operator a reference so I could send Toasts for Debugging.p  pBut now, the Runnables seem to not run or complete, any Log.e or Log.d stuff doesnt arrive in the console.p  pAfter some googeling and stackoverflowing, everyone is just always explaining what the difference is between Handlers, Asynctask, and Threads. And the multitask examples always only show something like codenew Threadnew Runnableruntask1.startcode times 3 with different tasks.p  pAnd so became my big questionp  pstrongHow to correctly, over a longer time lifecycle of the MainActivity, with different tasks, use a background threadstrongp  pEdit to clarify, I would also like a direct solution to my special problem.p  pEdit 2 after reading nikis comment thank you, the simple answer seems to be use HandlerThread instead of thread. Will try that as soon as I get home.p  pTrying a HandlerThread now. It seems my OpHandler, initialized in coderuncode, gets destroyed or something after coderuncode has finished, not sure whats up here this is btw another mystery of the kind I hoped would get answered here. I get a NullpointerException as soon as I try to use it after coderuncode has finished.p

Negative 263 pI have errexit and pipefail enabled for my shell script, because thats the behaviour I usually want. However, occasionally I want to capture errors and handle them a specific way.p  pI know that errexit is disabled for commands that contain boolean operators or are to be used as a condition if, while etc.p  pe.g.p  precodegit push ampamp true echo Pushed  codepre  pwill echo Pushed 0 on success, or Pushed emsomething elseem on failure.p  pHowever, what if I want a subshell to have errexit enabled, but then I wish to capture the exit code of this subshellp  pFor example p  precodeusrbinenv bash set o errexit       git push     echo Hai  ampamp true  echo Did it work  codepre  pThe problem is, bash sees the ampamp boolean operator and disables errexit for the subshell. This means that Hai is always echod. Thats not desirable.p  pHow do enable errexit in this subshell, and capture the status code of the subshell without letting that exit code terminate the outer shell strongwithout constantly enabling and disabling errexit all over the placestrongp  h2Updateh2  pI have a strong feeling the solution is to use traps and capture the exit signal.

So, I tried adding word boundaries with codeegrep []lt[09]gt MWE.fcode, but this command throws the following errorp  precodebash [09] No such file or directory codepre  pI assume this means that lt is being interpreted as pipe input from the file to the right, so I tried escaping the boundary characters with codeegrep []lt[09]gt MWE.fcode.

To keep it simple, Ive used integers in this example.  Once I get integers figured out, Im going to extend this to floating point types.  Then I should be able to find any single precision 4 byte reals and change them to double precision 8 byte reals.p

Negative 263 pAt my organization, we have a process that synchronizes user password changes with Google. We recently transitioned this process from the Provisioning API to the Admin SDK Directory API. In doing so, however, we started receiving error responses for a small number of password changes and, upon investigating, we determined that our internal support staff is responding to password reset requests from users by setting temporary passwords that do not meet the password length requirements defined in our Google domain. Clearly, we have some process changes to make internally.p  pThese errors only appeared after the switch to the Admin SDK Directory API, which brings me to my question. strongIs there a difference in how the two APIs enforce password length requirements defined in the domain More specifically, did the Provisioning API emnotem enforce those requirementsstrongp

Negative 263 pIve just been looking at the performance improvements in Googles V8 Javascript engine since I want to incorporate it into one of my own projects.p  pMy interest at the moment is with the hidden classes. The basic idea is that V8 creates hidden classes as properties are added to an object so as to efficiently look up that property, avoiding a dictionary search.p  pFor example, when you create a new codePointcode object called codepcode, it create a hidden class codeC0code which is a class with no properties and attach that class to the objectp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEGill.png altenter image description herep  pThe statement codep.x  0code will modify the object to add the property, then create a emnewem class codeC1code specifying that the codexcode property can be found at a specific offset within the object.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0JN3u.png altenter image description herep  pSo getting at codep.xcode after that is a  Finally, executing codep.y  0code will perform a similar operation, ending up withp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAfH82.png altenter image description herep  pNow this is actually rather nifty since, if you create another codePointcode object codep2code, no new hidden class needs to be created, it just gets assigned to codeC0code. Similarly, adding the codexcode and codeycode properties in that order will also be efficient in terms of not having to create a new hidden class.p  hr  pBut I have two potential issues with this scheme. The first involves what happens with the following code segmentp  precodePoint p3  new Point p3.y  3141592653589 p3.x  2718281828459 codepre  pIt seems to me that this would create two emnewem hidden classes, one with codeycode at offset zero and another with codeycode at offset zero and codexcode at offset one.p  pThis seems a little spaceinefficient as the final classes in both cases have an codexcode and a codeycode so should be able to share the class codeC2code, albeit with the requirement that you would need to swap codexcode and codeycode in the object itself.p  pWhat would be the impact of making the transition map a little more controlled, such as ensuring properties are stored alphabetically That way, whether you add codexcode then codeycode, or codeycode then codexcode, you would still end up at the same final class.p  pThis would mean a little extra work when adding a property but could substantially reduce the number of hidden classes.p  pOr is that extra work likely to be a too much of a performance drain in itself p  hr  pThe second potential issue is that, since the entire purpose of this scheme is to avoid a dictionary lookup on the object, how does moving thep  precodeFor x, see offset 0 For y, see offset 1 codepre  pinto the class helpp  pIt appears to me that you will emstillem need to lookup the property name in the hidden class to get the offset within the object.p  pOr am I missing something and no dictionary search of the class is requiredp

Negative 263 pI have a field in a query that is checking how the user entered the date on the main form. I am trying to make it like a single entered date when the first text box is fill in and like a strongdate rangestrong if an ending date is entered into the second text box. So if the ending date text box is blank, it should be ignored and the query should run as if filtering only on a specific date. I used the below expression and only entered the starting date, so it should only consider the field as being filtered by 1 date, not a range. But the query returns blank. code[Text0]code is the starting date and code[Text3]code is the ending date. The field is a job date field intended to only return job numbers from either that date or inside the date range.p  pExample If code[Text0]code is set to 4202015 and code[Text3]code is blank, the query should return job numbers A18, B18, and C18.

Negative 263 pIm using a hrefhttpwww.drewgreenwell.comprojectsmetrojs relnofollowMetroJsa and Ive used an individual function to initialize each tile because I only ever want to see the back of one tile at a time. So with this code, each tile fully animates, showing the back and front, and then pauses for a while so that the other tiles do the same.p  pAnyway, that isnt important, as you can see my code is pretty inefficient now with a lot of repeat code. How do you think I could improve this to make it a lot shorter Ive thought about using a loop to initialise them all but Im not sure how to go about it.p  pThe reason I have used individual initialisers is that I need to create a count which applies to each tile, but I cant create the count variable from within code.liveTilecodep  pJSp  precodevar count1  0 var count2  0  .livetile.one.liveTile     animationCompletefunction          count1         if count1  2              .livetile.one.liveTilerestart, 10000             count1  0                 .livetile.two.liveTile     animationCompletefunction          count2         if count2  2              .livetile.two.liveTilerestart, 10000             count2  0                codepre  pOne way to make the codecountcode variables a bit cleaner could be to move each initialisation into a function, which creates the count variable inside that function, but again then I would need to make the rest a bit more efficient.p

Negative 263 pIn this code, I am trying to convert a decimal number to binary. Yes, I am aware that such a function exists  I was trying to reinvent the wheel as an exercise. Because I am using a function codetoBinNumcode to convert the number, I wanted to pass an empty array by reference, then store my binary digits in the array, and upon returning to the codemaincode function, I would have the array codebinNumcode. This does not happen I pass the pointer, initialize it and store my binary digits, but then when I return to codemaincode and attempt to access the pointer, it fails, issuing an codeAccess violation on pointercode error. I am assuming that the memory is being freed up, although I cant figure out why, given that the scope of the pointer is in codemaincode, and the codenewcode keyword was used in codetoBinNumcode when I created the array inside it. Why isnt this working, and how can I fix itp  precodeinclude ltcmathgt include ltiostreamgt using namespace std  void toBinNumint, int, intamp  int main     int binNum  nullptr binNum will hold the array of binary digits     int binNumSize     toBinNum100, binNum, binNumSize      int numOnes  0     for int j  0 j lt binNumSize j         if binNum[j]  1 ERROR.             numOnes         cout ltlt binNum[j]          cout ltlt numOnes      cin.get   void toBinNum.

Negative 263 pI am experiencing problems with displaying values on the console while invoking a C subroutine from a fortran subroutine.

However, upon executing the program, the C statements are printed before the two Fortran statements, rather than between them. Ive looked thoroughly within the code, and there are no calls to the C subroutine elsewhere, so there is no obvious reason why the c statement should be printed before the Fortran statement.

No errors, then entire set runs correctly I have only tested to 400 groups, will do a full run of all 10k overnight.p  pHowever, if I attempt to run the loop in parallel, invariably pandoc throws an error 1 in converting the file. If I run the broken loop multiple times, the task in the loop or cluster, not sure which task refers to in this context which causes the error changes. p  pThe template file is pretty basic, it takes in parameters for groups, runs an SQL query on the connection defined for the cluster worker, and utilizes ggplot2  dplyr to generate results.

Negative 263 pIm confused between Div ID, Div Class, Div Style and Span HTML tags. So far in my website Ive used just Div ID on everything separately and Its worked just fine. However I needed help with something on another question and I got an answer in which a person provided me with some code that used span ID. Now parts of the HTML on my site use this Span ID tag within a div ID tag, And I literally dont understand what its for. Ive also heard other Div tags such as Div Class and Div style. p  pI just dont understand what the difference is. They all seem to do the same thing. Can anyone explain where I should use all these different Div and Span tags. Im very confused. The only guess I can make is that Span Id is used to identity different elements within a single Div. But I would benefit from a explanation of all of this.  p

Negative 263 pI have a weird situation where I have a decorator on a django view that only works intermittently. When I reload the page the associated with the view it behaves as if there is not decorator on it.

Any ideas Has anyone else experienced this. p  pI know that the decorator is working sometimes because I have set break points in the decorator code and it will occasionally stop. Other times it will just reload the page normally as if there was no decorator. p

Negative 263 pTo my knowledge all versions of Chrome running on all platforms have this feature.p  pFeature basically is issuing three randomlooking DNS queries upon start and some people claim also periodically while running under certain circumstances to find out if DNS server resolves successfully all DNS queries, including ones for nonexistent domain names.p  pIt looks like a sketchy behavior and lots of people freak out suspecting malware or something wrong. p  pUnfortunately, randomlooking DNS queries is really a good i.e. has low percentage of false positives indicator of malware, which often uses this trick to communicate back to command amp control servers to download malicious payload and newer versions of attacking malware.p  pSo if you have an advanced IDS in your environment that watches for this behavior to detect malware AND many of your users use Chrome, it effectively renders this indicator useless.p  pIt looks like this sorry, dont have enough reputation to post images, but basically these are www.sfklj202sf2js8fj2l.com queries in a network capture and you can easily recreate this in your environment with Google Chrome and Fiddler or any other network capture software, like wireshark or MNM or message analyzer.p  pThere are a lot of discussions of this behavior on the Internet example search query Google Chrome random DNS queries in your favorite search engine, but none of them concerns about controlling this. There are several questions on how to turn it off on Google Chrome support forum, but they remain unanswered.p  pI tried to browse through Chromes advanced settings and aboutflags, but havent found any control that would allow me to disable this feature. I disabled all privacy stuff that might be related like DNS prefetching, but it doesnt stop randomlooking DNS queries.p  pI know that Chrome has tons of config files in users profile that we arent supposed to touch. I wonder, if theres a way to stop Chrome from doing this and how Any input is appreciated, including speculations, because Im desperate here and expect that there could be no solution here unless Google decides to fix it by introducing a new setting to control this behavior...p

Negative 263 pShouldnt the time complexity of Dijkstras algorithm and Bellman Ford algorithm be codeOV2code and codeOV3code respectively I have been reading both their pseudo code from a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiBellmanE28093FordalgorithmAlgorithm relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiDijkstra27salgorithmPseudocode relnofollowherea. p  pBoth Bellman Ford algorithm and Dijkstras algorithm look quite alike except for Bellman Ford algorithm doing the same process as Dijkstras algorithm for codeVcode times where codeVcode is the number of nodes. So why did every article I visit on this topic says that Dijkstras algorithm runs in codeOv2code and Bellman Ford algorithm runs at codeOVEcode time complexity Where did I go wrong if I really did p  pUpdate  Dont you think codeE  V2  V 2code if each node is connected to each other node So while considering the worse case, we do have to consider the worse case So lets consider that every node is connected with every other node. Now we get, codeOV3code for Bellman Ford Algorithm. Am I rightp  pSo we have codeOVEcode  codeOVV2  V2  OV3code. Am I right or wrongp
