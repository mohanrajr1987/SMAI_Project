That will allow users to request data from the server without any limitations using local characters.p  pAs far as I have find out, there may be an option to drop constraints and etc. change collation and then just to bring everything back.

Positive 74269 pI have used SQL Merge for CRUD operations in a table that holds records more than 3 million and due to merge locks the table this would gives time out errors on other selects and updates in the production environment.p  pSite has been accessed by multiple users at a given time and same table could be updated by different set of users at the same time.p  pso based on my scenario is using SQL merge is efficient or do i have to use INSERTUPDATEDELETE statementsp  pis there are any way that improve merge by only locking the data record instead of locking the entire tablep

Positive 74269 pI am trying to understand some behaviour that I have seen for a query that I am trying to optimise in MSSQL Sever 2012 Engine.p  pFor privacy reasons, I cannot post the entire 3 sets of union query, but I have managed to identify the UNION portion which incurred almost 16 of the costp  precodeSELECT      p.userid AS useridentificationpart,       AS subscriberidentificationpart,     ISNULLp.name,  AS name,      CASE         WHEN ISNULLp.subjectid,   s.subjectid THEN ISNULLsl.name, s.name         ELSE        END AS subjectname,     ISNULLbl.name, b.name AS bookname,     general reader AS type,      NULL AS enddate  FROM userz p NOLOCK, subjects s NOLOCK LEFT JOIN subjectlanguage sl NOLOCK ON s.subjectid  sl.subjectid AND sl.locale  enUS, book b NOLOCK LEFT JOIN booklanguage bl NOLOCK ON b.bookid  bl.bookid AND bl.locale  enUS  WHERE      p.ncode  JC001      AND p.ccode  DJ01     AND ISNULLp.subjectid,   s.subjectid OR ISNULLp.subjectid,        AND ISNULLp.bookid,   b.bookid     AND p.usertype  1          AND p.personid  00abcdefghi     AND p.activeuser  1     AND ISNULLp.enddate,    OR ISNULLp.enddate,  gt castgetdate as date codepre  pI came to know about the 16 cost on Hash Matching effort by rightclicking the entire query and selecting execution plan on SQL server. I am doing UNION between the above and two other queries which perform similar joins. None of the other queries take so much time. The total execution tame was 28 seconds.p  pWhen I changed the query above to the following, the speed improved drammatically 2s and I believe its mainly due to performing LEFT JOINS instead of INNER LEFT joins from userz p inner join subjects left join subject languagep  precode        SELECT          p.userid AS useridentificationpart,           AS subscriberidentificationpart,         ISNULLp.name,  AS name,          ISNULLISNULLsl.name, s.name, as subjectname,         ISNULLbl.name, b.name AS bookname,         general reader AS type,          NULL AS enddate      FROM userz p NOLOCK     LEFT JOIN subjects s nolock on s.ccodeDJ01 and ISNULLp.subjectid,   s.subjectid     LEFT JOIN subjectlanguage sl nolock on s.subjectid sl.subjectid and sl.locale  enUS,     bookname b NOLOCK LEFT JOIN booklanguage bl NOLOCK ON b.bookid  bl.bookid AND bl.locale  enUS      WHERE          p.ncode  JC001          AND p.ccode  DJ01         AND ISNULLp.bookid,   b.bookid         AND p.usertype  1              AND p.userid  00abcdefghi         AND p.activeuser  1         AND ISNULLp.enddate,    OR ISNULLp.enddate,  gt castgetdate as date codepre  pI am treating the UNIONS as a table using WITH AS and then selecting the top 20 results. So the entire query looks like the followingp  precodeWITH billtable useridentificationpart, subscriberidentification, part, name, subjectname, bookname, type, enddate AS        First query what I have put the above     UNION      Second query     UNION      third query SELECT TOP 20  from billtable codepre  pI am seeing a discrepancy between the results I saw before changing the query and after changing the query. For example, 23 rows were replaced by the ones that were not there before, but did match the query criteria. This makes me wonder, is it because how the TOP results are chosen by the SQL executor engine is different even though the query conditions would return correct results Also, Is my understanding about how the query speed has improved over the use of different JOINs correctp  pP.S. My understanding about how SQL execution works is the following not sure if this is correctp  p1 FROM and JOINS are evaluated firstp  p2 From the results above, WHERE if any conditions are evaluatedp  p3 From the results above any ORDERGROUPING is donep  p4 Selection of columns is made for the results above.p  p I also tried to check if the expected results are correct for other scenarios where there are not more than 20 results, and they are being displayed correctly.p  pAny suggestionguidance is appreciated.p

Positive 74269 pIm trying to generate some randomized data, and Ive been using newid to seed functions since it is called once for every row and is guaranteed to return a different result each time.

Ive put it into a script that shows the problemp  precodedeclare test table id uniqueidentifier insert into test select newid from sys.objects  select      floorrandchecksumid  4,     case isnullfloorrandchecksumid  4, 1         when 0 then 0         when 1 then 1         when 2 then 2         when 3 then 3         when 1 then 1         else 999     end,     floorrandchecksumnewid  4,     case isnullfloorrandchecksumnewid  4, 1         when 0 then 0         when 1 then 1         when 2 then 2         when 3 then 3         when 1 then 1         else 999     end from test codepre  pI expect the results to always be in the range 0 to 3 for all four columns.  When the unique identifiers are retrieved from a table, the results are always correct first two columns.  Similarly, when theyre output on the fly theyre also correct third column.  But when theyre compared on the fly to integers in a case statement, it often returns a value outside the expected range.p  pHeres an example, these are the first 20 rows when I ran it just now.  As you can see there are 999 instances in the last column that shouldnt be therep  precode0   0   3   1 3   3   3   1 0   0   3   3 3   3   2   999 1   1   2   999 3   3   2   1 2   2   0   999 0   0   0   0 3   3   2   0 1   1   3   999 3   3   0   999 2   2   2   2 1   1   3   0 2   2   3   0 3   3   1   999 0   0   1   999 3   3   1   1 0   0   0   3 3   3   0   999 0   0   1   0 codepre  pAt first I thought maybe the type coercion was different than I expected, and the result of rand  int was a float not an int.  So I wrapped it all in floor to force it to be an int.  Then I thought perhaps theres an odd null value creeping in, but with my case statement a null would be returned as 1, and there are none.p  pIve run this one two different SQL Server 2012 SP1 instances, both give the same sort of results.p

Negative 74269 pObviously, there is no one single solution that would satisfy everyones needs an architecture is always a tradeoff. I want to create a framework, originally aimed at RAD of web games. Target language is PHP, although the architecture should be widely applicable.p  pGoals that I have in head for this framework are flexibility in ways you can achieve the result maximal comfort for developers connecting modules like LEGOreg blocks many types of input, many types of output, one format for processing.p  pThe goals that are not a priority are speed, enterprise use and making money. Its supposed to be an open source project.p  pThe cornerstone of this design is that all content, before transformation, is processed in XML idea based on EAI system Ive worked with, eGate. The data abstraction layer  hopefully some smart ORM  is not important now. The output will be generated using XSLT or any other custom modules, for virtually any client  HTML for old browsers, XHTMLHTML5 for modern browsers, simple HTML for mobile clients, XML for AJAXXMLRPC, etc.p  pMain reasons for using XML are  p  ulliits a wellknown standardli liexisting tools like XPath, SimpleXML and DOM for navigating and modifying the contentli liXSLT providing a powerful and unified way to transform the code into any tag soupli liI find the XML markup very easily readable, therefore I dont think that advantages of JSON or YAML make a difference hereli liThe content can be stacked easily, and it the order of the content doesnt really matter as long as its transformed correctly with XSLTli ul  pThe page generation process would consist of these phasesp  olliPreprocessing initializing modules, processing GPCS data, applying default [XML] templatesli liProcessinggeneration main part of business logic, generating the bloated XML with maximum data although hopefully optimized not to generate balastli liProcessing some additional business logic, e.g. cutting down some of the markup, preparing for transformation, reporting, statistics, etc.li liPostprocessing parsing XML through the transformation engine most probably just XSLT, output.li ol  pThe content would be generated with a lot of metadata e.g. tags, permissions, importance, necessity, aimed output type, which would be stripped down during postprocessing.p  pSo, my question is except for speed, what is the downfall of this solution Where it could go wrong both during the developmentmaintenance of the framework, and its applications What are the downsides of this architecturep

Negative 74269 pIm using Java.p  pI have this thread, agent, that explores a room to determine its size and clean it if its dirty.

All I do is create the thread and say object.start.p  pThis works very well under normal circustances. However, the menus are enabled during this time, and that means the user can mess with the room while the agent is exploring it. That shouldnt happen.p  pSo, once the user clicks the option that tells the agent to clean the room, Id like to disable all the menus. Except this isnt working as it should. Heres the problemp  precode... public void ActionPerformedActionEvent e      disable the menus with setEnabledfalse     agent.start     enable the menus with setEnabledtrue  codepre  pThe problem is that the menus are enabled before the agent thread executes its function. I thought about using Thread.join  that would garantee that the code to enable the menus is only executed after the agent thread ends. But, if I use Thread.join the interface doesnt update itself while the agent is moving, because its waiting for the agent to finishp  pIve thought about disabling the interface from the agent and then enabling it once the agent is done, but Im not sure that would work and the biggest problem here is that the agent shouldnt be messing around with the menus.p  pSo, to sum it up, I need a thread executing to update the interfacedraw the agent moving, but that thread cannot be the same that enables the menu. It seems currently there is one thread doing both. Assuming thats possible and not too complicated.p

Negative 74269 pI read about a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStandardstreams relnofollowstandard streamsa. My understanding is old fashioned programs that dont have GUI need some kind of user interface, too. So Operating System provide each of them with a console window, and the console windows outinputerr stream was mapped to the programs standard inputoutputerror stream. And thus these programs are called console application. And this mappings couldnt be modified by the programmer.p  pI am wondering, if my understanding above is correct, does GUI program have these standard streams also I dont think its necessary since GUI itself is a good user interface.p

That means that I have to issue the requests from Wicket facilities and not from external clients like HttpUnit  HtmlUnit  Selenium.p

Negative 74269 pOur Django application has the following session management requirements.p  ol liSessions expire when the user closes the browser.li liSessions expire after a period of inactivity.li liDetect when a session expires due to inactivity and display appropriate message to the user.li liWarn users of a impending session expiry a few minutes before the end of the inactivity period. Along with the warning, provide users an option to extend their session.li liIf user is working on a long business activity within the app that doesnt involve requests being sent to the server, the session must not timeout.li ol  pAfter reading the documentation, Django code and some blog posts related to this, I have come up with the following implementation approach.p  pstrongRequirement 1strongbr This requirement is easily implemented by setting SESSIONEXPIREATBROWSERCLOSE to True.p  pstrongRequirement 2strongbr I have seen a few recommendations to use SESSIONCOOKIEAGE to set the session expiry period. But this method has the following problems.p  ul lipThe session always expires at the end of the SESSIONCOOKIEAGE even if the user is actively using the application. This can be prevented by setting the session expiry to SESSIONCOOKIEAGE on every request using a custom middleware or by saving the session on every request by setting SESSIONSAVEEVERYREQUEST to true. But the next problem is unavoidable due to the use of SESSIONCOOKIEAGE.pli lipDue to the way cookies work, SESSIONEXPIREATBROWSERCLOSE and SESSIONCOOKIEAGE are mutually exclusive i.e. the cookie either expires on browser close or at the specified expiry time. If SESSIONCOOKIEAGE is used and the user closes the browser before the cookie expires, the cookie is retained and reopening the browser will allow the user or anyone else into the system without being reauthenticated.pli lipDjango relies only on the cookie being present to determine if the session is active. It doesnt check the session expiry date stored with the session.pli ul  pThe following method could be used to implemented this requirement and to workaround the problems mentioned above.p  ul liDo not set SESSIONCOOKIEAGE.li liSet the expiry date of the session to be current time  inactivity period on every request.li liOverride processrequest in SessionMiddleware and check for session expiry. Discard the session if it has expired.li ul  pstrongRequirement 3strongbr When we detect that the session has expired in the custom SessionMiddleware above, set an attribute on the request to indicate session expiry. This attribute can be used to display an appropriate message to the user.p  pstrongRequirement 4strongbr Use JavaScript to detect user inactivity, provide the warning and also an option to extend the session. If the user wishes to extend, send a keep alive pulse to the server to extend the session.p  pstrongRequirement 5strongbr Use JavaScript to detect user activity during the long business operation and send keep alive pulses to the server to prevent session from expiring.p  hr  pThe above implementation approach seem very elaborate and I was wondering if there might a simpler method especially for Requirement 2. p  pAny insights will be highly appreciated.p

Negative 74269 pIve got two problems and I wonder if I can solve them in one go. Im trying to do natural language date parsing in Java well, Scala and have been using JChronic, the port of the excellent chronic RubyGem.p  pTheres two problems thoughp  ol lipJChronic uses java.util.Calendar rather than JodaTime, and I think it is pretty reasonable to say that JodaTime is, or should be, a replacement for the JDK date libraries. And if JodaTime doesnt replace the existing date libraries, JSR 310 sure will sometime after Oracle finish litigation and get back to maintaining Java.pli lipJChronic doesnt handle emgeneralem datetime parsing. If I tell it to parse next thursday 4pm or something like that, it handles it gracefully and gives me a Calendar object of the right time. But if I just say 2011 or January 1963 or something like that, it cant handle general date ranges or a hrefhttpwww.joda.orgjodatimeapidocsorgjodatimePartial.html relnofollowPartialsa in JodaTime speak.pli ol  pThe second of these is far more of a concern than the first. Im trying to extract from webpages dates that are about documents books, newspaper articles, web pages etc. where things like publication dates and copyright dates are important.p  pI currently feel like Im resigned to writing my own, or perhaps porting the ageing JChronic to use JodaTime and adding support for partials.

Negative 74269 pI have a RESTful web service that responds to useruserId with a marshalled XML representation of a emUserem domain object using JAXB. Whats an appropriate way of communicating back to the client additional details about their request, particularly if it doesnt return the information theyre expecting In a nondistributed Java application, you might have a catch block that deals with data access, or security exceptions.  In the event that useruserId doesnt return anything e.g. the web services persistence mechanism isnt working, there is a security restriction, etc... how do I include meaningful information in the response to the client p  pI dont think DTOs are what I need because Im not looking for different representations of a domain object. Rather, Im looking for information about what happened during the request that may have prevented it from returning the information the client expected. Would it be appropriate to enclose the domain object within some kind of ResponseObject that holds the relevant metadata The downside to this approach is that Id rather not have my service layer interfaces all have ResponseObject as their return type because I may very well provide a nonRESTful implementation that doesnt have the same metadata requirements. p

It seems codepsqlodbccode doesnt use a codePREPAREcode for SQLPrepare and SQLExecute. It adds the param value and send the query. As araqnid suggested i set the codelogdurationcode param to 0 and compared the results from postgresql log with that from the app and psql. The result are as followsp  precode                            psqlapp     pglog query executed from app      110 ms     70 ms psql with PREPAREEXECUTE     10 ms      5 ms psql with full SELECT         85 ms     70 ms codepre  pSo how to interpret that values It seems the most time is spend sending the full query to the database 10000 chars and generating a execution plan. If that is true changing the calls to SQLPrepare and SQLExecute to explicit PREPAREEXECUTE statements executed over SQLExecDirect could solve the problem. Any objectionsp

Negative 74269 pIm using SWIG to export a c class to Java, but ran into a problem trying to force the proxy object to implement an interface. p  pI scoured the SWIG documentation and found you could use pragmajava jniclassinterfacesx to have the JNI class implement a given interface, and use pragmajava moduleinterfacesx to have the module implement any given interface, but no corresponding pragma for the actual proxy object.p  pI would prefer having SWIG generate the implements X code, as trying to add that implementation later on is proving difficult. For example, if I try to subclass the SWIG proxy and then implement the interface, I run into issues because Im also using genericsp  precodeinterface IVectorltVectorTypegt     VectorType addVectorType other    ...  codepre  pSo something like this failsp  precodeclass MyVector extends MyProxyVector implements IVectorltMyVectorgt      MyVector addMyVector other          return MyVector super.addother       codepre  pbecause it would require casting a parent to a child class.p  pThe only other ways I can come up with getting around this problem is to either create a wrapper class or use a copy constructor. Both seem somewhat inefficient as their entire purpose to to implement the one interface.p

Negative 74269 pI have a complex query that requires a rank in it.  Ive learned that the standard way of doing that is by using the technique found on this page a hrefhttpthinkdiff.netmysqlhowtogetrankusingmysqlquery relnofollowhttpthinkdiff.netmysqlhowtogetrankusingmysqlquerya.  Im using Infobright as the back end and it doesnt work quite as expected.  That is, while a standard MySQL engine would show the rank as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc... Brighthouse Infobrights engine would return 1, 1, 1, 1, etc....  So I came up with a strategy of setting a variable, a function, and then execute it in the query.  Heres a proof of concept query that does just thatp  precodeSET rank  0  DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS GetRank DELIMITER  CREATE FUNCTION GetRank RETURNS INT BEGIN     SET rank  rank  1     return rank END  DELIMITER   select GetRank AS rank, id from accounts codepre  pI then copied and pasted the function into Jasper Reports iReport and then compiled my report.  After executing it, I get syntax errors.  So I thought that perhaps the  was throwing it off.  So at the top of the query, I put in DELIMITER .  This did not work either.p  pIs what Im wanting to do even possible  If so, how  And if theres an Infobright way of getting a rank without writing a function, Id be open to that too.p

This is a C library that transforms a bitmap to make it look like it was output on a CRT TV with the NTSC standard. Its quite accurate, really.p  pThe first thing I tried, a while back, was to just use the C library itself by calling it as a dll. Here I had two problems, 1. I couldnt get some of the data to copy correctly so the image was messed up, but more importantly, 2. it was extremely slow. It required getting the XNA codeTexture2Dcode bitmap data, passing it through the filter, and then setting the data again to the texture. The framerate was ruined, so I couldnt go down this route.p  pNow Im trying to translate the filter into a pixel shader. The problem here if youre adventurous to look at the code  Im using the SNES one because its simplest is that it handles very large arrays, and relies on interesting pointer operations. Ive done a lot of work rewriting the algorithm to work independently per pixel, as a pixel shader will require. But I dont know if this will ever work. Ive come to you to see if finishing this is even possible.p  ol liTheres precalculated array involved containing 1,048,576 integers. Is this alone beyond any limits for the pixel shader It only needs to be set once, not once per frame.li liEven if thats ok, I know that HLSL cannot index arrays by a variable. It has to unroll it into a million if statements to get the correct array element. Will this kill the performance and make it a fruitless endeavor again There are multiple array accesses per pixel.li liIs there any chance that my original plan to use the library as is could work I just need it to be fast.li liIve never written a shader before. Is there anything else I should be aware ofli ol  pedit Addendum to 2. I just read somewhere that not only can hlsl not access arrays by variable, but even to unroll it, the index has to be calculable at compile time. Is this true, or does the unrolling solve this If its true I think Im screwed. Any way around that My algorithm is basically a glorified version of the input pixel is this color, so look up my output pixel values in this giant array.p

Negative 74269 pI ran into this problem multiple times in my career, and never was able to find a elegant solution for it. Imagine you have a simple page, that has a repeater. You populate that repeater on the serverside through the databinding. Thats great, works fast and does what its supposed to. But now you want to add paginator to that repeater, or otherwise change the output. Doing it through Ajax is a preferred way to enable rich client interaction.p  pSo you create a webservice that serves you the data as JSON, but now you are stuck... Either you have to write complicated clientside code to find each field that you need to modify in each repeateritem, or you have to blow away the whole serverside output of the repeater and construct new HTML from the scratch, or, the method that Ive been using lately, take the first repeated item, blow away everything else and clone the first item as many time as you need to and modify its fields.p  pAll of the described methods are not optimal, because no matter what, they require quite a bit of repeated logic on the serverside i.e. template in repeater and on the clientside javascript to display JSON data. Theres got to be a better, easier way to do this. First thing that comes to mind, is instead of returning JSON from the webserver, return HTML of the prepopulated repeater. But for something like that, I might as well use ASP.NET AJAX Update panel. The output isnt going to be any smaller with a standalone webservice.p  pNext thing that I thought of, is JavaScript templates. What if there would be some way to take unprocessed repeater template on the serverside, and convert it to JavaScript template that could be either embedded on the page at load, or served as part of the webservice response. However, I couldnt find any existing solutions for something like this. And I cant think of a simple way to do that myself. Any ideasp  pP.S. Rendering JavaScript template to the clientside on page load, and using JavaScript to populate it without the initial view being rendered on the server no repeater and databinding is out of the question. I care too much about performance.p

Negative 74269 pI extended the functionality of a line object using a class which takes a line handle as an input argument to its constructor. This class then creates a codeWindowMouseMotioncode listener to detect a mouseover the line which highlights the line and displays a panel containing controls for setting some linedata properties. This is working well.p  pI am now trying to make this class detect and respond to the line being deleted by listening for the lines codeObjectBeingDestroyedcode event.

Negative 74269 pI am making progress in my assignment, but have run into a minor sticking point.  While I research it, I thought I would ask the question on this forum so if any one else runs into a similar issue, they can rely on the scholarship we present here.  p  pOn to the question... I am rendering data I receive from an XML string into views in a grid format.  I want to be able to navigate to another page by clicking on a link that is in that row.  That link will take me to another more detailed view of the data presented.  I will use some of the data that is display on the link to query my xml via LINQ to XML and get the appropriate rows to render on the next page view.  My question is, how would I do this in MVC  In vanilla asp.net I would just put that information into the querystring or some other simple statemanagement variable.

But when swiping the other pages, they bounce.p  pstrongEDITstrong the optimal solution was make the first and last page bounce  so the user will get repsond there is no more pagespaging and the other pages without bouncingp  pthe annoying with the bounce when swiping pages is the bounce effect is not equal and same. somtimes it bounce more, and somtimes less.p  pI tought is somthing to do with the loading data in the pages, but I dont think its the case, cause it happens also when all pages are loaded and no async operation of loading are happening in the background. Any ideas p  pstrongEDIT 2 strong  I guess the bounce property is about the edge of the UIScrollView,  But when moving from page to page there is also bouncing. Sometimes I can see a little of nextnext page. For example  swiping from page 2 to page 3 , and in the animation of swiping I can see for 0.1 second page 4.p  pAlso, the animation of swiping is not constant. and it feel that each swipe acts little diffrent. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 74269 pJust a quick one  Im in the process of writing a Sega Master System emulator. The design thus far is that the GUI JFrame subclass etc. runs in the Event Dispatch Thread, via an EventQueue.invokeLater call, and all the emulator functions run in a separate thread. From what I understand this is supposed to be good practice, as the EDT is supposed to initialise and update the GUI, with Swing not being threadsafe.p  pThis leads me to a small question  the console runs in the separate thread Z80, VDP, etc. and the VDP when Ive finished it will update a BufferedImage. As long as I mark this BufferedImage as synchronized, is it safe to then access it from the EDT the GUIs paint method in particular I ask this as otherwise I will have to put a lot of VDP logic into the paint method itself, and Id rather not do this, as it will slow down the GUI overall.p  pSimple question I know, but Im still getting used to pushing Java2D for decent speed animation. It is worth mentioning that right after the repaint method is called in the logic thread, the logic thread will sleep until woken for the next frame pass, so Im guessing there wont be a performance hit from this design  am I rightp  pMany thanks, Phil Potterp  pemUPDATEem I should have used better language  the VDP will be accessing the BufferedImage through a synchronized setter method and the EDT will be accessing it through a synchronized getter method.p

Negative 74269 pI have made an application with PHP. I am not an OOP developer and I everything I know I learned it by myself. I have a login screen and a file that I include it in the top of all my files. These files check if the user is authorized and if the session is ok and then give the access, else it redirects to the login page.p  pI thought that this was safe but I used Websecurify chrome addon and it gave me many security errors that I have to check. Those errors was from php pages that where protected with usernamepassword authentication and session cookie.p  pWebsecurify accessed forms, posted data and did a lot of things to pages that should be protected. How can I protect my scripts from crawlers and botsp  pAlso websecurify said about apache authentication  The application used WWW Authentication. This type of authentication is often considered insecure and vulnerable to a range of attacks.p  pIs this true Really I need your opinion how to protect my php scripts from unauthorized access.p  pThe

Negative 74269 pI am wanting to create an application whose behavior is directly related to that of another web application.  Essentially, there is an application that runs within Gmail that dynamically  interacts with the the interface based on the actions of the user.p  pThe problem I am running into is that I want to make an application that interacts with that web application, but they do not offer an open API.  As such I cant just call the api for the data i need.p  pWhen I open the development console in chrome I can see the application running, and the debugging comments that run based on the activity.p  pIs there any way that I can crawl that dynamic activity using something like PhantomJS to base the activity of another application.  p  pIF the console says X in the command console, run Z script in this other application.p  pI am clearly not an engineer, but want to have an idea if something like this is possible.p  pA very hacky way to deal with a closed API.

Negative 74269 pWe had a kernel module which writes into a file and we read the proc file to get some information regarding hardware operation. The hardware operation statistics data became more than 3072 bytes PROCBLOCKSIZE  so we locally buffer the data by defining a global buffer of size 4096 bytes . Once the data is completely read then we move the data to the procreadkernel buffer to the local buffer. This is done as per hack 2 defined around line number 165 in linux2.6.28procfsgeneric.c. We are not sending eof till the entire buffer is read so read proc will be called two times one for 3072 bytes and next for 1024 bytes. We do a memcpy to copy the data to the read proc buffer. The read proc will be invoked only by command line.p  pBut inserting this particular module after adding the global buffer is making some difference in the performance numbers of get from storage device . If we do not do modprobe of this kernel module then we are seeing better numbers. Logically the global buffer will be in BSS area and since the command is not called so memcpy will also not be invoked. We are not able to explain this anomaly. Any pointers will be highly helpful.p
Negative 74269 pIm thinking of learning hadoop but not sure if itll solve my problem.  Basically I have a job with a queue and a bunch of workers.  Each worker does a small amount of work and then either saves the resultsif successful or sends it back to the queue for further processing.  My problem is scalable, is limited by the bandwidth on the networkec2 which will never keep up with multiple cpus crunching the data.  I thought maybe I could run my jobs in Java in a hadoop cluster and have hadoop distribute the work via a queue.  Would this be a better approach I am correct in assuming hadoop can a queue and try to run jobs as locally as possible to minimize bandwidth usage and maximize cpu usage My program is very cpu bound but most of my recent problems with its performence are related to passing work over a networkI want to keep the work as local as possible, but the difference between the hadoop tutorials I see and my problem is that in the tutorials all the work is known in advance while my program is generating new work for its self constantlyuntil its finally done.  Would this work and would it help me reduce the impact of passing messages over a network p  pSorry Im new to hadoop and wanted to know if it could solve my problem.p

Negative 74269 pBackground  For the most part, Im self taught in C, so I apologize if this is some simpleminded problem.  I am creating something to the effect of a mailing list each object has name, address, contact info, etc and will be printing out in labels there will be two colums and four rows per printed page.  I have the list in formMain where you can add, edit and delete individual labels and I have a form printPreviewone for individual entries selected from the list.p  pThe problem Im trying to create a print preview form for the whole list generating a group box containing a text box and picture box for each object from the list  that way Ill have exactly the number of labels as objects  then fill each box with the content respective to each object on the list.

Negative 74269 pI started an new app and I wanted to use the latest patterns and guidelines for android, one of those is to use Loaders AsyncTaskLoader instead of AsyncTasks, Im trying to see if Loaders are suposed to really replace all your AsyncTasks tasks i.e.p  pLets say you want to build an app based on REST calls, one of those calls is in charge of login the user. So while you click submit on a fragment button a dialog comes up until the response gets back, if Im correct the AsyncTaskLoader onLoadFinished wont let you dismiss a dialog unless you use a handler, and well using this, makes the solution look a bit hacky, cause then you need to show error dialogs like for when the username or password is wrong, and well you may end up with a bunch of calls to handlers.p  pI did this in a snap using an AsyncTask and all working ok, now that I was moving all the code to AsyncTaskLoader it seems Im hacking many things when its supposed to be easier, Im a beginner so please be patient with your answers.p  pI appreciate the time you take.p

Negative 74269 pI am working on implementing BFSK modulation and demodulation with frequency hopping and I need to test my results using Matlab. The output the I am getting from my BFSK program is an array of sine values corresponding to the carrier signal for different bits. These signals are passband signals centered at 2.51KHz with a band width of 4KHz around it. But to test the demodulation step, I need to convert the signal to baseband. So I need to center my output signal at 0Hz. p  pI know that creating a complex signal of 2.51KHz and multiplying it in timedomain would do this job. But is there any method that I can use with codefftcode function in matlab to shift the center frequency of the signal and then take an codeifftcode of the signal to generate the baseband signal.p  pThanks, Anshup
Negative 74269 pI do a bit of animation geekery as a side hobby, mostly in Javascript DOM and canvas based as well as having done a bit in C and other technologies. However most of it has been based on sprites, bounding boxes, simple pixel movements etc  and now Im interested in using vector graphics and implementing a character with realistic moving joints driven by physics forces. Id like to get something going either in the canvas element or SVG.p  pThere are plenty of questions on here relating to inverse kinematics, but most of them are a bit low level and assume a prior knowledge of vectors, forces, and engineering terminology. What Id really appreciate is some pointers on the fundamental principles behind how a basic stickman with hip, knee, ankle joints etc can be made to move semirealistically.p  pI use Knockout.js a lot and have been wondering if I can implement the positioning of each joint via Knockouts computed functions, where for example the location of the knee joint is computed from the positions of the hip and ankle joints and forces operating on them. But Im having a hard time finding a starting point Ive been walking in slow motion around my house like an insane man trying to isolate which parts of the human body actually move first and how each part responds to the movements of the others. Is there a generalized approach to how the humanoid figure is set in motion in games and animationsp  pBearing in mind that Im used to working with pixel coordinates as opposed to vectors and forces, am I being naive to try to tackle this in isolation Will I find that I immediately also need to learn about centres of gravity, momentum, and all the restp  pAny help appreciated, including links to noob tutorialsp
Negative 74269 pI have been working in a small shop which has been running VB6 for its main application. I started there about six years ago. In my previous experience Ive only ever dealt with MSSQL. This shop primarily uses Oracle. Since ive been there Ive mostly worked in .NET. Ive even managed to slowly integrate some semblance of order by introducing CSLA framework even though my colleague knows nothing about OOD or OOA as hes been working in VB6 and has been consumed by it as well as managing the database. p  pOne of the most annoying observations is that my colleague insists on creating a unique account for each every user who needs access to the database. There is also a separate table which provides in depth detail of the users access rights. In order to utilize connection pooling I created a unique authentication piece which authenticates the user against Oracle and then stores the user rights in the PrincipalIdentity. I then use a common account which then facilitates the normal routine communication with database. p  pSince implementing this Ive noticed a decrease in TNS errors. p  pDoes anyone see any conflict with this approachp

So, for instance, the MS Html handler would generate AuditDoc.Title from an html textbox with the variable Title within the AuditDoc viewmodel.  My dilemma is that JQuery validation doesnt like that DOT in the middle of the name.  So when I put AuditDoc.Title as the name to validate against, it gives me a javascript error.

My opinion is in the YES, this is a race condition category. Actually I gave this example as a race condition situation, on a different question.  At the same time, I also read some interesting comments in the NO, this isnt a race condition category.  I think I will settle and conclude that this is or isnt a race condition depending on the perspectivelevel from which one looks at the problem.

Negative 74269 pIm working on a web service using the topdown approach, generating service types and interfaces from a WSDL using JAXWS wsimport.  This provides a port type interface as follows, which I implement.p  precode   This class was generated by the JAXWS RI.   JAXWS RI 2.2.4b01   Generated source version 2.2   WebServicename  ExamplePortType, targetNamespace  httpexample.com public interface ExamplePortType              param example       return java.lang.String       throws ExampleException           WebMethod     WebResultname  exampleResponse, targetNamespace  httpexample.com     RequestWrapperlocalName  sendExample, targetNamespace  httpexample.com, className  com.example.SendExample     ResponseWrapperlocalName  sendExampleResponse, targetNamespace  httpexample.com, className  com.example.SendExampleResponse     public String sendExample         WebParamname  example, targetNamespace  httpexample.com         ExampleRequest example         throws ExampleException       codepre  pIt seems like the normal way to add this service to your application server in my case, Tomcat, is to add the implementation class to the web.xml as a servlet and add WSServletContextListener as a listener.  Very roughly, it seems that on initialization of the context, the listener constructs ServletAdapters which wrap the implementation bean and add them to a WSServletDelegate which is called by a thin WSServlet.  Requests to your implementation are then handled by the WSServlet and passed to your bean by the delegate based on whatever URL patterns you have set up.p  pIs there a way to do the above programmatically  I want a method which accepts an instance of the above interface and returns to me an instance of a Servlet, which, if registered in a ServletContext, would route the appropriate requests to the wrapped implementation.  Something likep  precodeServlet exampleServlet  new ServletAdapter.wrapnew ExamplePortTypeImpl codepre  pOne requirement is that I cannot rely on static configuration files such as web.xml or sunjaxws.xml.  Does JAXWS or a related library ie Axis2, etc. provide this kind of functionalityp  pApologies if something is not clear its my first time here .

Negative 74269 pI want to implement some king of spatial indexing data structure for my codeMKAnnotationscode.  Currently its horribly slow when I try to filter them based on distance criteria  34k of locations, currently extremely slow with a simple double codeforcode ... .p  pId like to create clusters of codeMKAnnotationscode, to decide if it is close to another. Also, these locations are in a somewhat creation order and a previousnext functionality would be needed to jump between this is not a must.

What algorithmdata structure should I use p  pstrongUpdatestrong I store these locations in a Core Data database, they represent a path. When the map is opened they are fetched into an array and then I just use that array for distance calculations and annotation creation.  When the user moveszooms the map, I loop through them and decide what needs to be changed on map, so it is kinda static the whole stuff. As I understood, if Id be using a tree, I could store the locations there and when a zoommove happens I just search through it and obtain the ones in the new region. Is this true    p  pEven in the dynamic case, when I can add new locations to this array, it would be a single insertion and its happening rarely.p

I dont know yet how much, but therell be a lot of different terms.p  pI had some approaches, like replacing p  precodeSELECT REPLACEREPLACEname,St.,Saint,St,Saint FROM cities WHERE name  REPLACEREPLACESearchTerm,St.,Saint,St,Saint codepre  pBut the performance is ugly.p  pAlso codeSoundExcode doesnt really give the results I need, because Saint and St dont sound similar at all.p  pThe citynames come from a external datasource by mergereplication, so I cant update them on the server and I dont want to update the citynames, but use them as they are stored in the db.p  pHow could I do the search to fit my needsp

Negative 74269 pBefore I go asking more questions about the coding, Id like to first figure out the best method for me to follow for making my database.  Im running into a problem with how I should go about structuring it to keep everything minimized and due to its nature I have lots of reoccurring data that I have to represent.p  pI design custom shirts and have a variety of different types of shirts for people to choose from that are available in both adult and child sizes of both genders.  For example, I have crewneck shirts, raglan sleeves, ringer sleeves and hoodies which are available for men, women, boys, girls and toddlers.  The prices are the same for each shirt from the toddler sizes up to 1x in the adult sizes, then 2x, 3x, 4x and 5x are each different prices.  Then theres the color options for each kind of shirt which varies, some may have 4 color options, some have 32.p  pSo lets take just the crewneck shirts for an example.  Men s1x, Women s1x, Boys xs1x, girls xs1x and toddlers NB18months is a total of 22 rows that will be represented in the table and are all the same price.  2X and up only apply to men and women so thats 8 more rows which makes 30 rows total for just the crewneck shirts.  When it gets into the color options, theres 32 different colors available for them.  If I were to do each and every size for all of them that would be 960 total rows just for the crewneck shirts alone with mainly HIGHLY repeated data for just one minor change.p  pI thought about it and figured Its best to treat these items on the table as actual items in a stock room because THEYRE REALLY THERE in the stock room... you dont have just one box of shirts that you can punch a button on the side to turn to any size of color, you have to deal with the actual shirt and tedious task of putting them somewhere, so I deciding against trying to get outrageous with a bunch of foreign keys and indexes, besides that it gets just as tedious and you wind up having to represent just as much but with a lot more tables when you couldve just put the data its linking to in the first table.p  pIf we take just the other 3 kinds of shirts and apply that same logic with all the colors and sizes just for those 4 shirts alone there will be 3,840 rows, with the other shirts left Im not counting in you could say Im looking at roughly 10,000 rows of data all in one table.  This data will be growing over time and Im wondering what it might turn into trying to keep it all organized. So I figured maybe the best logic to go with would be to break it down like the do in an actual retail store, which is to separate the departments into men, women, boys, girls and babies. so that way I have 5 separate tables that are only called when the user decides to go to that department so if theres a man who wants the men shirts he doesnt have 7,000 rows of extra data present that doesnt even apply to what hes looking for.p  pWould this be a better way of setting it up or would it be better to keep it all as one gigantic table and just query the men shirts in the php from the table in the section for men and the same with women and kidsp  pMy next issue is all the color options that may be available, as I said before some shirts will have as few as 4 some will have as many as 32, so some of those are enough data to form a table all on their own, so I could really have a separate table for every kind of shirt.  Ill be using a query in php to populate my items from the tables so I dont have to code so much in the html and javascript.  That way I can set it to codeSELECT ALL  table WHERE typemencode and it will take all the men shirts and auto populate the coding for each one.  That way as I add and take things to and from the tables itll automatically be updated.  I already have an idea for HOW Im going to do that, but I can only think so far into it because I havent decided on a good way to set the tables up which is what Id have to structure it to call from.p  pFor example, if I have all the color options of each shirt all on the same table versus having it broken down and foreign keys linking to other tables to represent them.  that would be two totally different ways of having to call it forth, so Im stuck on this and dont really know where to go with it.  any suggestionsp

A simple layout of 3 items with transparent background to show the problem better.

The resulting list is code1000code long, but at least one of the lines will actually be a concatenation of a line, without the codencode, and most of another line from a little way strongupstrong 36 lines strongbackstrong, exactly 4096 bytes, in this example the file this makes some sense as the file is read backwards, see below.p  pLooking at the files codeseekcode and codetellcode positions before and after the codeislicecode, I get e.g. code3530855code and code3651687code respectively, a read size of code120832code bytes.p  pIf I seek the file back to code3530855code when I encounter this error, in pdb, and then do codefile.readlines120832code I get code1092code lines codereadlinescode size is only a hint, so that makes sense, and the munged line is not present but the component parts of it are intact in their correct respective indexes.p  pThere are no other processes reading from or writing to that file, so I cannot see how it would be shunted forward while doing an codeislicecode, for example.p  pThe position of the first codetellcode before the codeislicecode, given above as code3530855code is reached by a backwardsreader generator the file is codeos.dupcoded, first, inside the generator, codeyieldcodeing line by line  a loop on the generator codebreakcodes when it has found a line that contains the last timestamp it successfully sentp  precodefor line in BackwardsFileReaderfp     if somecondition         break codepre  pandp  precodedef BackwardsReaderseekfile, size4096, pos1     Read a file line by line, backwards     fd  os.dupseekfile.fileno     buf       whence  os.SEEKEND if pos lt 0 else os.SEEKSET      with os.fdopenfd as readfile         readfile.seek0, os.SEEKEND         if readfile.tell  0              File is empty, bail.             return         readfile.seekpos, whence         buf  readfile.readsize         readfile.seekpos, whence         newlinepos  buf.findn         if newlinepos  1             trailingnewline  True             buf  buf[newlinepos]         else             trailingnewline  False          while 1             newlinepos  buf.rfindn             pos  readfile.tell             if newlinepos  1                  Found a newline                 line  buf[newlinepos1]                  Seek the original file to the end of buf                 seekfile.seekpos  lenbuf, os.SEEKSET                 buf  buf[newlinepos]                 if pos or newlinepos or trailingnewline                     line  n                 yield line             elif pos                  Need to fill buffer                 toread  minsize, pos                 readfile.seektoread, 1                 buf  readfile.readtoread  buf                 readfile.seektoread, 1                 if pos  toread                     buf  n  buf             else                  Startoffile                 seekfile.seek0                 return codepre  pIf I dont bother islicing the file, and read the whole lot on my Mac the problem still happens, but not at that same place, and less frequently.p  pThe only thing I can think of is that the generator might be progressing the file further backwards by 4096 bytes, the buffer size while islice is reading the file forwards... The weird thing is that this never happens on the Linux box. Low level file operations arent my bread and butter, and when combined here with a generator, I think I must be missing something  can anyone suggest the next debug step here, or offer a hint about what might be causing this disparityp

Negative 74269 pI am going to create a bloglike application for a University.  I have been given access to their server, but I was not granted access to their databases.  The server has PHP installed, so I plan on utilizing that.p  pAt the very least, I would like to give the user the ability to post a blog.  Though this is not a strict requirement, the ability to comment on each blog post would be nice.p  pIf I were to keep the application very simple, I could just use flat files to store the blog posts.  Using flat files would be fairly unwieldy when incorporating comments, however.  Another option would be to use SQLite, though I have not confirmed whether or not that is installed on the host.p  pNeither of the above options are ideal.  I have also been looking at Googles Blogger API.  This seems like a good option, but the limitations are fairly, well, limited maximum of 100 posts, 1MB per post, etc.  Are there any other sites out there that provide blogging webservices  I am certainly not looking for stuff like Wordpress.com or Blog.com, as I want to write custom software.  I am strictly looking for a way to store and organize the information, for free.  Google Storage also sounds like an option, but I dont want to start paying if the site gets too much traffic although it will be a pretty lowtraffic site.  p  pThanks for any ideasp  pstrongEDIT Looking for a FREE solutionstrongp

Negative 74269 pI have to search on many associated models through a hasmany relationship. For arguments sake, lets say I have a Product model with many categories through a hasmany association. Because I have to do this with many of the parent models child associations, Ive created a cache table, where I store all the ids in the association as a comma separated string  23,34,56,78 rather than doing a join. This also helps with advanced searches I need to do later with conditional ANDs on the category ids.p  pMy question is what is the best way to query the presence of an id in such a string in active record.

Am I correct in thinking that as long as I built the unorderedmap with no collisions, my lookup time will be O1p  pMy concern then is what the complexity becomes if there the key is not present in the unordered map.  If I use unorderedmapfind, for example, to determine whether a key is present in my hash table, how will it go about giving me an answer  Does it actually iterate over all the keysp  pI greatly appreciate the help.p

Negative 74269 pI have what I think is a very basic question about JAXRS but I somehow cant easily find the answer.p  pI am trying to refactor a REST service which uses a standard Javax servlet  routing requests to methods by hand  into an cleaner JAXRS implementation. The current application sets some variables during the servlet init. It assigns those as attributes of the HttpServlet class so they are available during each doGet and can be passed as parameters to request processing methods. For clarity, one of these is a ConcurentHashMap that acts as a cache.p  pNow, with JAXRS, I can extend Application to set my resource classes. I can also use the Context annotation in each resource implementation to inject things like ServletContext when processing a request. But I do not know how to similarly inject variables set during application initialization.p  pI am using the Apache Wink 1.3.0 implementation of JAXRS.p

Negative 74269 pI am developing a project in robotics using android camera. The robot can move and clean the surface if any objects are found in the path. I am stuck in detection of objects in the path, I am not using any sensors to find the distance between the camera and the objects. I am only using a camera to find the objects in the path. I dont want to find out shape, type, color of object in the path. small objects in the path can be ignored such as sand , grass etc. There should not be any big objects in the path in the marked portion of the figure belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combtKpI.jpg altenter image description herep  pWhile detecting objects using camera paintings, shadows, are detected as objects. From the above figure the music symbol is detected as an object. Is there is any paid or open source library to find out real object detection using camera it will be more helpful if it is usable in Java or c. I have tried opencv, javacv, jhlabs,jjil, aviary sdk, jiu, imagemagic, etc. But no where i can find an exact solution for my need.

If it is not possible please give me an explanation why it was not possible. p  pThe possibilities i have triedp  ol lipFace Recognition algorithm feature detection  Face detection algorithm based on matching a pattern.

Negative 74269 pWere developing some sort of Web API, which allows us to set values for hierarchical structure like thisp  precodeltROOTgt     ltCOLLECTIONELEMENTgt          ltSIMPLEELEMENT gt  alias  nail         ltSIMPLEELEMENT gt  alias  hammer          ltCOLLECTIONELEMENTgt             ltSIMPLEELEMENT gt  red             ltSIMPLEELEMENT gt  green         ltCOLLECTIONELEMENTgt      ltCOLLECTIONELEMENTgt         ....     ltCOLLECTIONELEMENTgt          ltSIMPLEELEMENT gt  alias  nail         ltSIMPLEELEMENT gt  alias  hammer          ltCOLLECTIONELEMENTgt             ltSIMPLEELEMENT gt  red             ltSIMPLEELEMENT gt  green         ltCOLLECTIONELEMENTgt      ltCOLLECTIONELEMENTgt ltROOTgt codepre  pAs you can see we have two types of elements codeCOLLECTIONELEMENTcode, which can contain codeSIMPLEELEMENTcode and other codeCOLLECTIONELEMENTcodes. Each field in hierarchical structure has an alias, which is actually exposed to the partner we do not want to expose the structure of our hierarchy, alias is unique per structure.p  pThe problem is that we do not really know how to give our partner good API when he want to updateset codeSIMPLEELEMENTcode, which belongs to the nested codeCOLLECTIONELEMENTcode. For example,p  pRight now I have two codeCOLLECTIONELEMENTcodes on the root level. I want to update codehammercode value for second codeCOLLECTIONELEMENTcode entry. So for right now were using such structure codehammer[1][2]  newHammerValuecode.p  pcode1code Shows that it should set first occurrence of codehammercode inside 2 parent collection elements. That works pretty well, but if we have more complex structure with a lot of nested levels we can have something like this codehammer[1][2][3][5][2]code, in that case its pretty hard to handle all the errors and index mismatches and it doesnt give our partner any idea what he is setting right now.p  pSo the questions is, how to set hierarchical structure values through the codeWebApicode using friendly names and without exposing the structure itself to the user Any ideasp

Negative 74269 pSo, Im using git with Git Extensions 2 on Windows with a large VB6 codebase. For anyone who isnt familiar with VB6, it is caseinsensitive and has a habit of changing the case of variable names whenever you save a file. There are steps which can be taken to minimise this behaviour see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1064858stopvisualbasic6fromchangingmycasingStop Visual Basic 6 from changing my casinga, but it is unfeasible to completely eliminate the problem in this way. The problem of course is that the case changes show up as changes in Git, thus interfering with the commit history to the point where actually changes are almost impossible to find.p  pIm looking for a way to handle this from the source control side and would appreciate any input. The avenues Im currently pursuing are in order of preference arep  ol liMake the Git diff case insensitive  Cant seem to find a way to do this. It will also not pick up changes to strings, but thats a price Im willing to pay for an easy fix.li liReset hunks with only case based changes before commiting.li liMove to Visual Source Safe which has an option for case insensitive diff  No...li ol  pIve got a feeling that option number 2 is probably my best bet, but Im not really sure of the best way to handle it. My current line of thinking isp  ul liCreate some tool to automate Git command lineli liUse the interactive prompt to iterate all changes, splitting down to the smallest hunksli liFor each hunk, if the only changes are to case only, reset itli ul  pIm pretty sure this is about as good of a solution as is possible. Running this tool before staging will solve all of the problems. Does anyone have any thoughts on this methodp  pAlso, if i do go down this route, it would be preferable to have a Git hook to prevent any case only changes. I have absolutely no idea how to implement something like this, so any help towards creating such a script would be great.p  pTo give some idea of the scale of the problem, when the case of a variable changes, it will change EVERY instance of every variable with the same name in open files. Every commit, this will have happened to several variables and it will appear as if 30 of each modified file has changed. This makes a manual process which is what Im currently doing quite impractical and only useful for really small commits.p  pMany thanks for any helpp

Negative 74269 pAnother question regarding list syntax I am slowly learning I think. I have data in the following simplified formp  precodeac1,2,3,4,5,NA,NA bc6,7,8,9,10,NA,NA cc6,5,3,NA,NA,NA,NA dcNA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA Adata.framea,b,c,d Bdata.framec,b,a,d Cdata.framed,c,b,a mylistlistA,B,C binsc0,2,4,6,8,10 codepre  pI would like to bin each column in the list of dataframes according to the bins defined and then return a mean number for each bin for each dataframe. I dont mind particulary what form the output is, a dataframe or a list of vectors. Thus in this examplep  precodehista,bins, plot FALSE histb,bins, plot FALSE histc,bins, plot FALSE codepre  pgive counts ofp  precodecounts [1] 2 2 1 0 0 counts [1] 0 0 1 2 2 counts [1] 0 1 2 0 0 codepre  prespectively.p  pI dont know how to do it but given that d contains only NAs I would like it to returnp  precodecounts [1] 0 0 0 0 0 codepre  pI guess turn each NA into 0.p  pTherefore the mean of A which contains a,b,c,d would bep  precodecounts [1] 2 2 1 0 0  counts [1] 0 0 1 2 2  counts [1] 0 1 2 0 0  counts [1] 0 0 0 0 0      2 3 4 2 2  4     0.5 0.75 1 0.5 0.5 codepre  pThis would be my desired output for dataframe A. The final list of vectors would also include relevant vectors for B and C although as I said a dataframe of columns for each dataframe in the initial list would also be fine since the final step will be for me to plot these mean counts against the midpoint of the bin.p  pI hope my explanation is enough to give some idea of what I am trying to do.p

Negative 74269 pI have an issue using Volley with conditional GETs on cached responses when the request goes through one or more redirect hops. p  pOn the initial request, if the server responds with a 302, the HTTP stack Im using the default HurlStack transparently follows the redirects and ultimately returns the response from the final server.p  pOn subsequent requests, Volley adds an IfModifiedSince header to perform a conditional GET, but these are sent to the initial server, so instead of redirecting we just get a 304 response and the request never reaches the final server. p  pSince Volley is very loosely coupled with its underlying HTTP stack, theres no way to communicate the fact that the cache headers should only be sent with the final request.p  pThe best solution that I can see besides never sending conditional GETs is to write a custom HttpUrlConnection implementation that recognizes that certain headers belong to a specific URL and only sends those headers when appropriate. This means, I would have to save the URL of the final server somewhere, probably as a custom header so that it is saved in the cache along with the other headers.p  pA slightly less hacky solution would be to write a custom HttpStack implementation that handles redirects manually. But that would mean we could not reuse the connection for redirects to the same host, so it would be less efficient.p  pHas anyone else run into this issue and have a better solution It doesnt seem to be specific to Volley or HttpUrlConnection, but to any HTTP library that handles redirects transparently. How do you tell it which headers go with a given URL  p

Negative 74269 pI have a loop in my application that loops through a set of entities in the following fashionp  precodeforeachvar entity in mEntities      entity.Update  codepre  pSome of these entities maintain a networking component that will call a Azure Mobile Service in order to update their state to the server. An example is belowp  precodepublic class TestEntity      public int Index     public int PropertyValue      public async void Update              Task.Run gt              MyAzureMobileServiceClient.UpdateIndex, PropertyValue                codepre  pThe UI rendering is done by Monogame in a more traditional game loop fashion. Whilst I do not know the inner workings of it, I am fairly certain that it does not have an actual separate thread doing the work. In practice, this shows as the UI freezing every time this update is called.p  pI want to be able to run it smoothly in the background. In the old Windows model this could have easily been done by starting a new Thread that would handle it, but I dont understand the threading well enough in WinRT to understand what is wrong with my approach.p  pAny ideasp  p[update] I also tried thisp  precodeTask.Factory.StartNewasync  gt      whiletrue          await Task.Delay1000         MyAzureMobileServiceClient.UpdateIndex, PropertyValue       codepre  pEvery 1 seconds, I get a minifreeze like before.p  p[update 2] I tried this with a twist. I replaced the Azure Mobile Service client call with a standard HTTP request and it worked splendidly no minifreezes. Granted it wasnt to the backend yet, but at least I have a work around by doing the whole thing manually. Would prefer to not do that, however.p  p[update 3] This is getting peculiar. I realize I simplified the code in this question in order to get it coherent in the context. However, this appears to have removed the true source of the problem. I tried the following thingsp  ol liI created a HTTP request and created the request manually, called it inside the Task.Run and it worked splendidly with no latency.li liI called the Azure Mobile Service client Update DIRECTLY and there was no latency.li ol  pSo this brings me to where the problem lies. I basically have a wrapper class for the Azure Mobile Service. The real path that goes looks roughly like thisp  precodeCommunicationClient.UpdateAsyncmyObject  public Task UpdateAsyncMyObjectType obj      var table  mMobileServiceClient.GetTableltMyObjectTypegt     return table.UpdateAsyncobj  codepre  pThis causes the lag, but if I do this instead of it, it works with no latency whatsoeverp  precodevar client  CommunicationClient.MobileServiceClient var table  client.GetTableltMyObjectTypegt table.UpdateAsyncobj codepre  pSoooooo... I should probably refactor the whole question. Its getting tldry.p

Maybe it should have been done entirely in Linux.p  pI am also interested to jump to another Windows compiler such as MinGW in addition because of the Visual Studio licensing restrictions.

Negative 74269 pSo I dont have resharper I think the command was like ctrlshiftt.  When I want to search files I use ctrl comma.  The search box pops up and then I start typing.  But the built in preview just grabs whatever I have typed and opens the file.  Even though I am still typing.  So I am trying to open a file reportvaccine, but I only get out report and the preview has opened the first selected report.  It has pretty much rendered this form of quick file searching useless.  Which is a huge bummer because we have hundreds of procs and scrolling through and manually finding the file is a huge pain.  If there is a way to turn off preview I would be fine with that.  This command working properly is waaay more important to me than a preview of the file to be opened.  Thanks I would greatly appreciate the help.p

Negative 74269 pI have just downloaded the latest Arduino Library code from Github, and its broken my MQTT client program.  Im using PubSubClient 1.91 on Arduino, and Mosquitto 1.1.2 Build 20130307 on Mac OSX. I also tested against Mosquitto on Windows 7, same problem.p  pThe supplied Mosquitto clients work fine, Mac over to Windows, Windows over to Mac so its some problem with whats coming from the Arduino end. A wireshark trace shows the Arduino client sending the following data packetp  p1015ffff4d51497364700302000f000741726475696e6fp  pAnd the Mosquitto broker shows New connection from 10.0.0.115 Socket read error on client null, disconnecting.p  pBefore I start to crawl through the MQTT spec, can anyone see anything wrong with the data packet being sent Its got to be something to do with new Arduino library code... p  pemem Update Upon further investigation, it appears to be a code generation problem with avrg, although life experience tells me it will turn out not to be so.

Negative 74269 pI have a C, COMexposed .NET assembly, which I use heavily as a library for VB6 clients Office VBA.  I am extremely happy with it.p  pThat same COMexposed library is useful for me in some newer, .NET clients I have written as well.

But I now have several, independent copies of my COM assembly floating around with my .NET apps in addition to it being registered as a COM object on the machines in question.p  pThis means that every time I make a bug fix or add functionality to my COM, I need to update these floating copies as well which makes maintenance annoying at best. I want to expose my needed functionality emonceem, for all apps that use it isnt that the purpose of COMp  pI tried activating the COM using late binding, hoping I could get around the problem but I got different behavior on two different machines, so I decided to ditch that idea.p  pIs there an elegant way to handle this  I thought perhaps it would make sense to register the COM assembly in the GAC upon installation, but it just seems like the wrong thing to do since its already registered as COM plus, it seems like registering in the GAC is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma498367864414not considered good practicea.p

Negative 74269 pDue to decisions that are completely outside of my control, I am in the following situationp  ul lipI have a product listing on catalog.orgpli lipClicking the Add to Cart button on a product makes an AJAX JSONP request to secure.comproductadd[productKey], which saves the cart record to the database, emsets a cookie with the cart IDem, and returns a true response or false if it failedpli lipBack on catalog.org, if the response is true, another AJAX JSONP request is made to secure.comcartinfo, emwhich reads the cart ID cookieem, fetches the record, and returns the number of items in the cartpli lipBack on catalog.org once again, the response is read and an element on the page is updated showing the number of items in the cart if anypli lipAt this point, clicking the Go to Cart button on catalog.org displays the cart summary on secure.compli ul  pThis works beautifully in Firefox 17, Chrome 32 and IE 11. It also works in IE8  IE10 on our development and test environments, where catalog.org is catalog.development.com and catalog.test.com and secure.com is secure.development.com and secure.test.com respectively.p  pHowever, after we deployed to production, this stopped working in IE8  IE10. After adding a product to the cart, the number of items in the cart is updated successfully on catalog.org. Then, after clicking the Go to Cart button on catalog.org, the cart summary on secure.com shows nothing because it cant read the cookie. Going to Cache  View cookie information in IE develeoper tools shows no cart ID cookie. It should be there, just like it is there in other browsers and in our development and test environments.p  pI believe whats happening is IE is blocking third party cookies. We have added a P3P compact policy header to all requests on secure.com, but the cookie is still not being set. The header we are setting isp  precodeP3P CPCAO PSA OUR codepre  pWhy doesnt adding the compact policy header fix this in IE8  IE10 How can I fix this to work in all versions of IEp  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pThere are several good ideas posted below. I accepted sdecimas because it sounded the most promising. We ended up combining some of these ideas but managed to avoid XDomainRequestp  blockquote   ul   liClicking the Add to Cart button on a product makes an AJAX JSONP   request to secure.comproductadd[productKey], which saves the cart   record to the database, emsets a cookie with the cart IDem, and returns a   true response or false if it failedli   ul blockquote  pWe changed the action at secure.comproductadd to return a JSON object with a boolean indicating success or failure emandem the cart ID.p  blockquote   ul   liBack on catalog.org, if the response is true, another AJAX JSONP   request is made to secure.comcartinfo, emwhich reads the cart ID   cookieem, fetches the record, and returns the number of items in the   cartli   ul blockquote  pWe changed the callback function to check for both properties in the response object. If success is true and the cart ID is present, we create a hidden iframe on the page. The codesrccode attribute of the iframe is set to a new endpoint we added to secure.com. This action accepts a cart ID parameter and saves the cart ID cookie. We no longer need to save the cookie in the secure.comproductadd action.p  pNext, we changed the action at secure.comcartinfo to accept a cart ID parameter. This action will use the cart ID parameter if present to fetch the cart information, otherwise it will still attempt to read the cookie. This extra check would be unnecessary if we could guarantee that the iframe had finished loading and the cookie had been saved on secure.com, but we have emno wayem of knowing when the iframe has finished loading on catalog.org due to browser security restrictions.p  pFinally, the P3P header codeCPCAO PSA OURcode is still required for this to work in IE7  IE10. Yes, this works in IE7 now too p  pWe now have a solution albeit an incredibly complex one for saving and accessing cross domain cookies that works in all major browser, at least as far back as we can reliably test.p  pWe will probably refactor this some more. For one thing, the second AJAX JSONP request to secure.comcartinfo is redundant at this point since we can return all the information we need in the original request to secure.comproductadd action a side benefit of changing that action to return a JSON object  plus we can return an error message indicating exactly why it failed if there was an error.p

Negative 74269 pI have been trying to figure out how to do a simple fade in of image2 over image1 in the code below.  Normally I would use css with position absolute and zindex to place image1 on top of image2 and then fade out image1 to reveal image2.  Problem is Im trying to use Twitter Bootstrap responsive css which seems to preclude this and similar easy methods, so I turned to jQuery.  But I cant seem to get the coding right.  What Im using below only shows a split second of image1 before loading image2.  This is also only part of what I want it to do.  Once I have the delayed image src change, I would like to fade in the new image.  I have tried putting image2 in the containing div backgroundimage, but couldnt get the responsive css to treat it correctly.  So Im not sure what else to try.

Again, this is what I think so far since I dont fully understand them.p  pBesides creating a unique datatype with structs what would be the difference between structs and hashesdictionariesp  pWhat would be the main benefit of choosing structs p  pDoes it make sense to think about structs as hashes or dictionariesp  pAgain, Im just trying to have a better understanding about concept of structs in C.p  pThanksp

And Ive tested it without any additional hardware plugged in, to make sure that it isnt a symptom caused by the power supply not being able to sustain everything connected to the Pi, as someone suggested to me.p  pBy now Im totally out of ideas except that the hardware is maybe just faulty.

In the example above, industry was the key which contained a list of dicts, so each of the children dicts in the list have industry added to them.p  p2 Add Parent Items to Each Dict within List  in this case, the name and industry were the items in the top level list of dicts, and so the name keyvalue was added to each of the items in industry.p  pI can imagine some scenarios where you had multiple lists of dicts or even dicts of dicts in the Parent items and applying each of these subtrees to the children list of dicts would not work.  As a result, Ill assume that the parent items are always simple keyvalue pairs.p  pOne more example to try to illustrate the potential variabilities in data structure that need to be handled.p  pstrongSource Data Example 2strongp  precode[uindustry [    uid u112, uname uA,    uid u132, uname uB,    uid u110, uname uC, ucompany [                             uid500, usymbolX,                             uid502, usymbolY,                             uid504, usymbolZ,                   ]    ,    ],   uname umaterials,  uindustry uid u210, uname uA,   uname uconglomerates ] codepre  pstrongDesired Result Example 2strongp  precode[unameumaterials, uindustryidu112, uindustrynameuA,  unameumaterials, uindustryidu132, uindustrynameuB,  unameumaterials, uindustryidu110, uindustrynameuC,                          ucompanyid500, ucompanysymbolX,  unameumaterials, uindustryidu110, uindustrynameuC,                          ucompanyid502, ucompanysymbolY,  unameumaterials, uindustryidu110, uindustrynameuC,                          ucompanyid504, ucompanysymbolZ,  unameuconglomerates, uindustryidu210, uindustrynameuA, ] codepre  pI have looked at several other examples and I cant seem to find one that works in these example cases.p  pAny suggestions or pointers  Ive spent some time trying to build a recursive function to handle this with no luck after many hours...p  pstrongUPDATED WITH ONE FAILED ATTEMPTstrongp  precodedef flattensubtree, flattened[], path, parentdict, childdict     if typesubtree is list         for i in subtree             flattened.appendflatteni,                                       flattenedflattened,                                       pathpath,                                       parentdictparentdict,                                       childdictchilddict                                                                             return flattened     elif typesubtree is dict         lists           newparentdict           newchilddict           for key, value in subtree.items             newpath  path    key             if typevalue is dict                 for key2, value2 in value.items                     newpath2  newpath    key2                     newparentdict[newpath2]  value2             elif typevalue is unicode                 newparentdict[key]  value             elif typevalue is list                 lists[newpath]  value         newparentdict.updateparentdict         for key, value in lists.items             for i in value                 flattened.appendflatteni,                                       flattenedflattened,                                       pathkey,                                       parentdictnewparentdict,                                                             return flattened codepre  pThe result I get is a 231x231 matrix of None objects  clearly Im getting into trouble with the recursion running away.p  pIve tried a few additional start from scratch attempts and failed with a similar failure mode.p

Having 6 nominal attributes which I want to analyze for patterns, I need to transform those into binominal attributes, using the Nominal to Binominal Function.

I started using the nominal attribute with the least distinct values, resulting in a csv file containing my dataset ID and now 7 binominal attributes.

Negative 74269 pI have completed my first site, bar resizing it for different screen sizes. I have read up on how to do this, but before I start I wanted to find out if certain browsers for example chrome for windows 8 automatically resize content to fit the screenp  pI built my site on a 20inch screen, yet when I view it on my 11.6inch laptop in chrome, the page fits perfectly on the page. However, load it on an old square 17inch monitor and everthing it HUGE and you have to scroll non stop just to get anywhere. The same happens loading it on my laptop in other browsers.p  pSo if I create a CSS file with smaller properties and run a media query, am I risking shrinking the page that fits perfectly already in chromep

Negative 74269 pIm building a web application using node.js, this is my first time working with node. Im using express framework and I have a question about client side rendering. p  pAll the tutorials that I have found online talk about express and server side rendering. They talk about how you can use jade the express templating engine, to serve rendered templates as reponse to your web application.p  pMy application is going to be client heavy and most of the rendering will be done client side. I want to call server to just get plain JSON response and then render it client side, so server side rendering is not of much use. p  pIn this case, is express a right choice I really like the way I can write APIS in express but Im concerned about how to serve my application. If I dont want to use the server side rendering it would mean that I would have to serve static HTML at the first call which seems weird to me.  p

Negative 74269 pI have a simple application and I require a bit of assistance with one new feature. p  pThe application is a table view TV1 which is populated by the user adding an entry a button in the navigation bar which modally brings up a new view controller for the user filling in a name, event and amount text field and selecting a date from the date picker. p  pThe table view controller is part of a tab bar controller where the first tab shows everything timeline and the second tab shows just the list of events. If you click on an event, you segue over to see all transactions with that event. p  pIve added a bar button item here as well which segues to the Add Entry view controller, with the aim of having the event already selected. p  pWhat I mean by this isp  pSay you have 3 events called Wedding, Birthday and Anniversary in your transactions. If you click on the Event tab, youll see Wedding, Birthday and Anniversary in a Table view. Clicking Birthday will show you all the transactions where event  Birthday. p  pI have a bar button item which will allow me to add entries from this screen, but because its coming from the Birthday event, I want that event text field to already be filled in, in the Add Entry with the name of this event Birthday in this case. p  pIm using Core Data and NSFetchedResultsController. p  pThe situation right now is, when I press the button to add a new entry from the Selected Event Birthday, its not preconfiguring the event text field with Birthday in the Add Entry screen. p  pHeres some code which should hopefully explain what Im doing. p  pFrom the Event Tabp  precode This segues over to the selected event Birthday.   voidprepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue senderidsender      NSIndexPath indexPath  [self.eventTableView indexPathForCellsender]     Occasion selectedOccasion  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]     if [segue.identifier isEqualToStringSelected Occasion Segue]              ESelectedOccasionTableViewController selectedOccasionTVC  [segue destinationViewController]         [selectedOccasionTVC setOccasionselectedOccasion]       codepre  pFrom the Selected Event Tab Birthday, I create two segues, one for editing a cell and one for creating a new entryp  precode voidprepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue senderidsender      NSIndexPath indexPath  [self.selectedOccasionTableView indexPathForCellsender]     Transaction seletedTransaction  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]      The first segue is to edit the existing entry     if [segue.identifier isEqualToStringEditable Cell]              EDetailViewController dvc  EDetailViewController segue.destinationViewController         dvc.selectedTransaction  seletedTransaction           This segue is to create a new entry from the event     else if [segue.identifier isEqualToStringCreate New Entry From Event]              EddEntryViewController eAppEntryViewController  EAddEntryViewController segue.destinationViewController         [eAppEntryViewController setSelectedTransactionselectedTransaction]        codepre  pThe first segue is for editing the cell which works perfectly, but in the second segue, the one Im interested in here, Im not actually clicking on a cell Im clicking on a bar button item which will modally bring up the add entry.

Negative 74269 pDescription of app Widget displaying some information set to update every 60,000ms. One view Activity that serves as a place to set preferences used by Widget. All preferences save, and update just fine.  When the user presses the Close button, the information is updated, and the Widget gets the call to update.  The SavedPreferences are called inside the Widget void for onUpdate.p  pThis all works fine.  Thank you to many questions already answered here that got me that far  p  pHere is the issue...  When the automatic update fires later, the vars from the SavedPreferences fail to load.  Sometimes they do.  Sometimes the dont.  Since this is running on my tablet, I have no error log to report.  What I see is that the Widget doesnt crash, but it displays its raw XML with none of the TextViews populated with SavedPreferences. What I find really strange is that the even defaults are not loading.  That is, the key its loading is set that if nothing is found, its supposed to return the default.  This normally would be used for, say, the first time the Widget loads, and there are no preferences to load. Why wouldnt the defaults load if the reading of the preferences fails Why would the reading of the preferences fail so complelety, but only some of the timep

Whats up with thatp  pBigger picture Im really looking to have a national holiday calendar by country. timeDate has set up the UK, US, Switzerland, and Canada, but the rest of the G7 in particular Japan and Australia are missing. Perhaps this belongs in some other package If it doesnt my plan is to basically do a mix of modify the existing timeDate functions and write those that dont exist. someone somewhere has probably already done thisp
Negative 74269 pIm looking for the best way to display pdf document on a website. Surely I need to convert it to jpeg or gif for the browser to handle it. I read few posts but most refer to GhostScript and its pdf2image. But that solution calls for starting a process that would save a copy of pdf doc to the file system and then would have to be loaded back into memory for displaying. Frankly I find it a bit clumsy. For those of you who have done it, what library you used and if you could attach a link to some examples, Id greatly appreciate it.  Im developick a web application that helps manage manufacturing process and is accessed fron android tablets. Company has a stockpile of documentation in pdf files that is to be delivered to production managers. Id love the solution to be akin Crystal Report Viewer contron but I I understand that I have to stick to pdf to image conversion. Please give me some advise here.p

Where there sliders are changed when you click any. p  pThe problem is that when I pass the variables of the sliders in the third class are perfectly stored but when you run the code to modify sliders coming past the main class when clicked are FXML variables are null. p  pHere you have the code p  pMain classp  precodepublic class OpenPilot extends Application       Movements Movements  new Movements      Override     public void startStage stage throws Exception           Parent root  FXMLLoader.loadgetClass.getResourceFXMLDocument.fxml           Scene scene  new Sceneroot          scene.setOnKeyPressednew EventHandlerltKeyEventgt              Override             public void handleKeyEvent Key                 Movements.GetKeysKey                                stage.setScenescene         stage.show                  param args the command line arguments           public static void mainString[] args          launchargs        codepre  pControllerp  precodepublic class FXMLDocumentController implements Initializable       Movements Movements  new Movements      FXML public Slider SpeedSlider     FXML public Slider TurnsSlider          Override     public void initializeURL url, ResourceBundle rb           Send GUI Information         Movements.GetSlidersSpeedSlider, TurnsSlider            codepre  pMovementsp  precodepublic class Movements       Define Data Variables     public double SpeedValue     public double TurnsValue      Define GUI Variables     private Slider SpeedSlider     private Slider TurnsSlider      public void GetSlidersSlider SpeedSlider, Slider TurnsSlider          this.SpeedSlider  SpeedSlider         this.TurnsSlider  TurnsSlider       Get Sliders      public void GetKeysKeyEvent Key          System.out.printlnKey.getCode         System.out.printlnSpeedSlider          Platform.runLaternew Runnable                  Override public void run                      TurnsSlider.setValue10                                  codepre

Negative 74269 pI have been toying with OpenGL for about 2 weeks, creating hardcoded VBOs and making rotating triangles, but the question that has been lingering in my head is how the heck do I create more than one VBOVAO in realtime so I can handle multiple objects  And how do I render multiple objects on the screen  The binding system seems limiting and restrictive.  Eventually, I want to be able to create objects and draw them using a single Lua function.  Sorry for the nocode post, but I have no code to begin with as I am trying to figure this out conceptually.p

Negative 74269 pI am plotting a line with matplotlib, and I use an animation. Lets say there isp  precodeline1,  ax.plot[], [], lw2, label1 codepre  pMy Animation is done with a FuncAnimation. Now I do have a problem. I am plotting Values of Angles in a Range from 0 to 360. But the input values can be larger. If they are larger, I use modulo to bring them down to my range. Bad thing is When I come across a line with angle values like 358, 359, 360, 361, the values on my plot are 358, 359, 0, 1. This works as intended, but the plotted line has a connection from my 359 to 0 value. Is there a way to suppress this So lets say, draw a line from 357, 358. 359, and then continue at the bottom of my plot at 0, 1, 2, and not draw this vertical connection line between 359 and 0p  pEDITp  pI found a workaround for this problem I do have enough values that are close enough to each other, so i can use point markers instead of a full line. But this is only a small solution for the problem, if your values are not as close to each other as mine are, you will only have random points in your plot. Here is what I didp  precodeline1,  ax.plot[], [],., lw2, label1 codepre  pEDIT2p  pI am now using simple plotting instead of animations.

Negative 74269 pI hope Im just being silly here.p  pFor an app Im trying to create 2 seperate layouts to scale the text nicely on two different physical devices, without having to generate a lot of conditionals in my code. The two specific devices Im having trouble with arebrp  pSamsung Galaxy TabPro br 8.4 Tabletbr 1600x2560 px Real  800x1255 DP  800dp  320dpi  2.0 density  1600x2560 px Normalp  pSamsung Nexus 10br 10.1 Tabletbr 2560x1600 px Real  1280x727 DP  800dp  320dpi  2.0 density  2560x1504 px Normalbrp  pHow do I differentiate between these two devices in the layouts folder They have the same dpi group, same density modifier, same dp group, same resolution, same everything. Except that one is 2 inches bigger than the other.p  pEDIT To add information about the exact issue why I want to differentiate. Text with certain textsize SP shows up bigger on the 10 tablet compared to the 8 one. So much bigger in fact that the text becomes unsigthly. As if you turned on Accessibility options without actually having them onp

Unfortunately, I have a problem because when I set the WMP Controls volume it adjusts the whole apps volume, whereas setting the texttospeech objects volume does not affect WMPs volume. Is there a way to play an mp3 so ideally both volumes are completely independent of each otherp

Negative 74269 pIm designing a web application that allows editing pages.

For example, inline content elements such as a time or image, or counter, or tickertape text can be altered by the user within the page.p  pAnd sometimes reposition is disallowed, turning the page to a template which only allows users to vary text and some appearance settings.p  pstrongCan you suggest such a presentation slide page editor for a web applicationstrongp  pIf you are going to suggest TinyMCE or the like, please specify what enables these to do inline or floating content elements, and whether it allows pixelperfect editing as shown in my screenshot.p  p.. i am guessing there is no such thing, and id have to build something from scratch.

Negative 74269 pI have a model, codeCardcode, that belongs through an codeevaluablecode polymorphic association to codeContent1code and codeContent2code codeContent1code and codeContent2code both have a codehasone card, as evaluablecode. Also, codeCardcode codebelongsto listcode, so the codeContentscode have virtually one codeListcode through codeCardcode. p  pcodeContent1code and codeContent2code are resources They can be created and updated through a form by the user. In those views, I would like to make possible to also edit the list. For example, the view for creating codeContent1code also would allow to give the name of the list which is associated to Content1 though the codeCardcode.p  pI would like to strongallowstrong developers strongto extend the codeContentscode ignoring as much as possible from the codeCardcode and codeListcodestrong stuffs, in a framework fashion. Ideally, they would just write the part of the views related to the codeContentcode itself, and those would be included in a view with the list related fields. p  pOn the controller side, for the moment, each codeContentscode has its own controller, but they implement only two methods, codeevaluableparamscode which parses the params related to the codeContentcode model and codeevaluablemodelcode which just returns the model class. All the actions are inherited from an abstract controller that uses those two methods in their implementation.p  pIt works pretty well since the controller code for each codeContentscode is very short and does not require to know anything from the rest of the app except the Content model. but Im not sure it is the Rails way to do things, and maybe it would be hard to extend with other kinds of contents.p  pSo my main problem at this time is on the view side codeContentscode have their own controllers and own view. p  ul liIs it possible to integrate those views to include the List fields, without the codeContentscode controllers and view even knowing that there is a codeListcode model li liIs the controller inheritance a sustainable design  Are there other solutions li ul  pI guess this problem is not so particular, but I probably lack of the right terminology or keywords or Rails knowledge. Id be grateful for any indication, or feedbacks from people whod have experienced a similar problem.p  pThanks for your helpp

One codekey, valuecode pair is codestatus gt truefalsecode. However, I find that when I try to post codestatuscode as a string like p  pcodestatus gt THIS IS NOT A BOOLEANcode p  pand create my object in my controller, the codestatuscode attribute of my object becomes codefalsecode. p  pTherefore, is there any clean way in rails to validate that my codestatuscode corresponds to a booleanp  pThanksp

Negative 74269 pI am playing around with Neo4j and so far I have a geographical graph where an codeAIRPORTcode is connect to a codeCITYcode, the codeCITYcode to a codeCOUNTRYcode and the codeCOUNTRYcode to a codeCONTINENTcode, as depicted in the pictureimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGaoyQ.png altenter image description herep  pLabels on the arrows translate to codeorg.neo4j.graphdb.RelationshipTypecode into my code. So far, I can build the path between the start node codeMXPcode to the end node codeLTNcode using the following monodirectional traversal.p  precodeTraverser traverse  database.traversalDescription.depthFirst   .relationshipsCITY, BOTH   .relationshipsCONTINENT, BOTH   .relationshipsCOUNTRY, BOTH   .relationshipsREGION, BOTH   .evaluatorEvaluators.includeWhereEndNodeIsendNode.traversestartNode codepre  pWith this, I get a single path codeMXP gt Milan gt Italy gt Europe lt England lt London lt LTNcode, which is correct given the graph description, the traversal description and of course my understanding my understanding of such description.p  pI am trying to change this code to perform a bidirectional traversal, meaning I want to start from both codeMXPcode and codeLTNcode and stop at the collision point. I tried with the following snippet, where comments mean my understanding so it may easier to point out the problem.p  precodeTraversalDescription startSide  database.traversalDescription.depthFirst Depth first algorithm   .relationshipsCITY, OUTGOING consider CITY relationship, only outgoing   .relationshipsREGION, OUTGOING consider REGION relationship, only outgoing   .relationshipsCOUNTRY, OUTGOING consider COUNTRY relationship, only outgoing   .relationshipsCONTINENT, OUTGOING consider CONTINENT relationship, only outgoing   .evaluatorEvaluators.excludeStartPosition do not consider the starting point.                                                 Here I tried also with all, with the same result                                                with includeWhereEndNodeIsendNode, again with same result                                                and combining includeWhereEndNodeIs and excludeStartPosition, once more with same result.                                                All tries I mirrored for the endSide description, changing endNode to startNode where I feel it was needed  TraversalDescription endSide  database.traversalDescription.depthFirst   .relationshipsCITY, OUTGOING   .relationshipsREGION, OUTGOING   .relationshipsCOUNTRY, OUTGOING   .relationshipsCONTINENT, OUTGOING   .evaluatorEvaluators.excludeStartPosition  ListltNodegt asList  Arrays.asListstartNode, endNode Traverser traverse  database.bidirectionalTraversalDescription.endSideendSide.startSidestartSide.traverseasList, asList codepre  pHere, instead of the path I am getting with the monodirectional traversal try, I get two paths, one with only codeMXPcode and one with only codeLTNcode.p  pAt this point I seriously believe I am completely misunderstanding the bidirectional traversal and maybe even its purpose. Where is my mistake Why I do not get the same outputp

Negative 74269 pRight now, our application only has one Web Site instance along with SQL Database deployed at Azure US datacenter. We are looking for deploying more Web Site instance at other datacenter such as APAC and Europe. There still be a local SQL Database for each of those web site instance. We would like end user could fail over to another instance if his registered instance is not available, such as if US web site instance is down, we could fail over user to Europe instance. With this, we would need to synchronize local SQL Database at all data centers, US, Europe and APAC. p  pSo we are looking for whats best approach to implement the database synchronization here for Azure SQL Database.

Negative 74269 pIm trying to recreate Hearthstone cards as objects in Java, but Im having trouble doing this in a good and efficient way.p  pAll cards have some common properties like a name. But the problem is that there is about 300 cards to generate, and there is about 30 different abilities that each card may or may not have. Now, do I have to create a basic card class with all the possible abilities set to false and then set all its specific ability parameters to true This approach seems to get very messy with all the getters and all the extra information that some abilities needs to specify... So my question is if theres there a better way to solve this kind of problemp  pI would like to create these card objects so that Im only adding the specific abilities as fields, but I cant figure out how to do this in a good way.p  pThankful for helpp
Negative 74269 pSo I have 200 event handlers and 90 of them always use 3 variables a, b, c.

Im guessing there isnt a fix for this.  If its that easy to fix it just by highlighting it, it probably isnt a problem with the code.p  pBasically it works as intended in IE11 and chrome and Firefox, but if you do this fiddle in IE10, youll notice when the child div slideToggles, the background color starts over in the child div rather than extending to include the child div as it expands.p  pIf you try this fiddle in IE10 you should see what I mean.  It will look normal in all other browsers.p  pIm wondering if there is anything I can do to modify my CSS code to make it work properly in IE10 also.p  pIve triedp  precodebackgroundimage mslineargradienttop, FFFFFF 0, A4A4A4 100 codepre  pbut it still doesnt do anything different in IE10. The normal way I use it isp  precodebackground lineargradientFFFFFF, A4A4A4 codepre  pwhich works in IE11 and all the other browsers.  It seems its just IE10 that is throwing me through a loop.p  pThe weird part is, if i open Developer tools and highlight any of the divs,the colors reset and look like they are supposed to look when the div is expanded.  That, to me, says its clearly a bug with how IE10 is displaying it on its first run of the code.p  pAnything I can do or is it just IE10 people are gonna see it slightly different. This bug doesnt stop my code from working or the webpage from being useable just makes it look weird.p

As I have said, I am just a beginner, so I am still figuring out the best practices, etc. For example, I have tried passing imageURI directly to ft.upload function, but I have read somewhere this is the way to do it.p  pOf course, everything is wrapped in on click handler, and works ok until to the point I pick an image from the file system. I think I have tried uploading both images from the SD card and internal storage.

I ended up using a workaround  transferring a file as base64 string via ajax and recreating it on the server. I achieve this using ImageURI variable directly, with emdestinationType Camera.DestinationType.DATAURLem option set. Let us leave this workaround here as a solution if anybody else is having the same issue but I am still very much opened to doing this properly.p

Negative 74269 pI am writing a 2D lunar landerstyle game in Java and using the Slick2D library to handle the graphics.  I am having a problem handling the background images.  p  pHere is my problem I have 3 layers of details to paint on the background behind the spaceship stars, mountains and land including landing sites.  These are repainted each loop as the ship centre of the screen moves around.p  pThe images for these layers are 4500 pixels wide by 1440 high.  This is mainly to create some sense of variety stars and to be sufficiently wide to hold the generated mountains and land the land includes the landing sites.  Mountains and land are generated per turn and are polygons drawn into holding images.p  pSlick2d or opengl is complaining that it cannot handle images of this size  it says it can only handle textures that are 512 x 512 on my development PC.  So... if I have been exploring different methods to work around this includingp  pa. doing polygon clipping in each loop to reduce my polygons mountains and land to the displayable screen size 640 x 480, but this seems mathematically challenging, orp  pb. splitting my layer images into 512x512 tiles and then updating the screen with the tiles, which is an extension of what I already do wrapping the layers to create an infinite world so seems more doable given my abilities.p  pMy first question or sensecheck, really is am I missing something  My images, although large, are minimal in terms of content, e.g. black background with a few lines on.  Is there a way to compress these in Slick2Dopengl or have I missed something to do with settings that means I can make my card handle bigger images  Im assuming not, based on what I have read, but hope springs eternal.p  pSo, assuming I have not missed anything obvious, on to part 2...p  pAs a quick I might get away with this workaround, I have reverted to using BufferedImages to hold the layers and then extracting portions of these into Slick2D images and painting these on the screen in each render loop.  Doing it this way I am getting about 3 FPS, which is obviously a tad slow for a realtime game.  p  pTo create the BufferedImages I am usingp  precode   BufferedImage imstars  new BufferedImagebWIDTH, bHEIGHT, BufferedImage.TYPEINTARGB    Graphics2D grstars  imstars.createGraphics codepre  p... and then I draw my content onto them stars, etc.p  pIn my render loop a do a bit of maths to work out which chunks of the images I need to display to cope with wrappingproviding an infinite experience and then extract the relevant portions of BufferedImage to a Slick2D images as followsp  precodeImage i1star  Tools.getImagestars.getStarImg.getSubimageint x1, int y1, width, height g.drawImagei1star, 0, 0 codepre  pI have written a static helper method to convert my BufferedImage chunk to a Slick2D Image as followsp  precode   protected static Image getImageBufferedImage bi       Image im  null      try         im  new ImageBufferedImageUtil.getTexture, bi       catch IOException ex         Logger.getLoggerTools.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex            return im     codepre  pIm guessing this is a bad way to do things based on the FPS I am getting, although 3 seems very low.  I was getting about 25 FPS when I was using code Id written myself doing the same thing  So, is there an accelerated Slick2Dopengl way to do this that I am missing or am I back to having to either tile my background images or hold them as polygons and develop a polygon clipping routinep

Negative 74269 pSo basically I would like to apply a filter to a binary image that takes a weighted average of the values of the neighboring cells. This part I have set up already.p  pMy problem now is I have an edge in my image which is not the edge of the matrix. I want to take a weighted after of the neighboring elements, but only do so for the particular elements that Im interested in. p  pThere are two approaches that I know of. Either 1 change the weight of the disk filter when the edge is in proximity to the disk or 2 somehow reflectmirror the values near the edge to the other side. The problem with 2 is that my edge is not straight and kind of goes everywhere. p  pHere is an oversimplification of the scenariop  precodebin   [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0          0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0          1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0          1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0          1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0          1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0          0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0          0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]  mask  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0          0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1          0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0          0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] codepre  pI want to apply a filter to codebincode but I only want to take weights of the elements that have a value of 1 in codemaskcode. I cant necessarily mirror codebincode because of the nonlinearity of the edge, so there must be some way to change to weights of the disk filter. For example, if the normal disk filter has 20 elements in it, each one would have a weight of 0.05. But lets say we are right up against a flat edge only half of the values of codebincode in the disk filter have a value of 1 in codemaskcode. Therefore there would be 10 elements, each with a weight of 0.1. Is there a noniterative way to apply a filter like thisp

Negative 74269 pTake a look at the following navigation img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIkPDj.png altChrome 39 headerp  pAs you see, the styling of the navigation is broken since Chrome 39. It works fine on Chrome 38 and any other modern browser.p  pThe only thing I see that fixes the layout is setting the fontsize of the  to any other size than 15px. But it should be 15px.p  pThe same thing goes for the top navigation links, changing the font from 12px to 13px fixes that too.p  pAny ideasp  pedit Ive isolated the problem and found the fix.

Negative 74269 pI wrote a project in eclipse CDT. It has the files SSLL.h and main.cpp. Main includes SSLL.h and catch.hpp which is a unit testing framework inside an include directory with a bunch of other catch files. p  pIt completely works in eclipse. But to submit to project I need to submit my two files and the exact g command line used to compile the project so my instructor can compile it. How do I use g to compile my project.p
Negative 74269 pI am trying to set up automated Azure deployments for a Bamboo OnDemand build server but I ran into some troubles along the way.p  pThe errors Im getting are along the lines of the following post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26919157Deploy a Cloud Service using Powershell and Teamcity failsa. Unfortunately, downgrading the Azure PowerShell cmdlets to the September 2014 version did not help.p  pBamboo OnDemand uses Amazon EC2 elastic instances to perform the actual builds. They provide readymade virtual machines Windows Server 2008R2 which load a Bamboo elastic agent. The agent runs under a user called codebamboocode. By default, this user is emnotem a member of the administrators group. To cover all my bases I added the user to the administrators group, but, to no avail.p  pIn order to save costs, I have a script which boots up the build server at 7 AM and shuts it down at 8 PM.p  pI am using a PowerShell script which I initially found on a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netsrkirklandcideploymentofazurewebrolesusingteamcity relnofollowScotts Bloga a hrefhttpsgist.github.comjnsn7dab1fbe99f1cf719097 relnofollowgista which I slightly modified to fit my needs. From my understanding, bamboo is executing the script using codeExecutionPolicy bypasscode but I already used codegpeditcode to allow PowerShell scripts to be run. However, I cannot find any relevant information to this in my build logs.p  pThe relevant parts arep  precodeImportModule Azure ImportAzurePublishSettingsFile PublishSettingsFile CToolsazure.publishsettings SetAzureSubscription CurrentStorageAccount service SubscriptionName subscription codepre  pFollowed by a function call to codePublishcode which in turn performs the following callp  precodedeployment  GetAzureDeployment ServiceName service Slot slot ErrorVariable a ErrorAction silentlycontinue  codepre  pWhen the codeImportAzurePublishSettingsFilecode call is present, I get the following errorp  precodeImportAzurePublishSettingsFile  An internal error occurred.

Negative 74269 pThe SocketScan API for iOS is written in ObjectiveC and is intended to integrate SocketMobile scanners in CHS mode into native applications.p  pWhen the ScanApi is initiated, requires the ViewController to be set as a ScanApiHelperDelegate, which requires some setup on the viewDidLoad as well as a few functions for receiving actions from the scanner.p  pVars are setupp  precodevar scanApi  ScanApiHelper var scanApiConsumer  NSTimer codepre  pThen in the viewDidLoad, the following code is implementedp  precodescanApi.setDelegateself scanApi.open scanApiConsumer  NSTimer.scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval0.2, target self, selectorSelectoronTimer, userInfo nil, repeats true codepre  pThen, the following function is called by scanApiConsumer to listen for notifications from the scannerp  precodefunc onTimer  gt Void     scanApi.doScanApiReceive     scanApi.getDevicesList  codepre  pWhen a barcode is scanned, it performs the followingp  precodefunc onDecodedDatadevice DeviceInfo, decodedData ISktScanDecodedData      code to execute here  codepre  pIf needed, the user is routed to another view where scanning a barcode executes different code.

And, on viewDidAppear on the original viewer, I have this setup, which also works as intendedp  precodeoverride func viewDidAppearanimated Bool      scanApi.setDelegateself  codepre  pThe issue arises when the user needs scanning functionality in a completely different area of the storyboard the remote view, where a prepareForSegue method isnt possible to trigger a scanApi.setDelegatep  pMy initial thought was to simply define scanApi delegate in the remote view by executing a scanApi.setDelegateself in viewDidAppear on the remote view. Of course, this view is also designated as a scanApiHelperDelegate and contains all the needed functions. However, it doesnt work. The original viewController is still the delegate and scanning barcode continue to trigger the functions listed in the original viewController, not the current one. The compiler returns no errors.p  pI suspect it is either a something about the way Swift interacts with the ObjectiveC API or b i am incorrectly declaring what should be the new scanApi delegate by using self.p  pSo, what is the proper way to declare the new scanApi delegate in this scenario or is this an issue with the APIp

Therefore, you can only draw UIImages over UIImageViews.p  pSo another problem arises here as well, because when it comes to placing the UIImage where the user touches, UIImages do not have the center property and i cant seem to position the UIImage according to touch.p  pIts easy to place the UIImage when its assigned to an imageView.

Negative 74269 pA friend has asked me to check out an old uni project he did using Construct 2. It was made using a uni copy of Construct so I have no way of editing the original files, and only have access to the online export. Please bare in mind that Ive never used Construct before, so I have no idea how it formats its code. Im more of a web designer but I said Id have a go. p  pSo the issue is it freezes after a few seconds. If I click quickly I can get past the intro screen, but if dont click the game freezes anyway. In other words the error is not caused by user input but by something happening in the background. p  pThe example is here  a hrefhttprosietheband.commoeba relnofollowhttprosietheband.commoebaap  pHas anyone seen this issue before I was wondering if using an older browser might do the trick, as it worked a couple of years ago when it was made, and nothing else has changed since. p

I want to parallel the model in this way, the master FMU is put on the main thread, and fork everything else on other threads. p  ol liI want to know if this simple idea is achievable by using FMUs exported from Dymola...li liIf possible, is it worthwhile doing it I wander if the parallel model is as efficient as as a sequential one at the physics level. I understand that a badly paralleled program is slower than a sequential one, but I just need to know if it is physically slower or fasterli liThe latest Dymola has built in the openMP features, has anyone ever used it What does it look likeli ol  pI found a paper about this Master for CoSimulation Using FMI a hrefhttpwww.ep.liu.seecp063014ecp11063014.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.ep.liu.seecp063014ecp11063014.pdfap  pGreatly appreciated for any answers or discussions. p

It is currently based on shell tools connected by named pipes.  Several processes work together to get the job done, communicating over named pipes, not unlike a production line in a factory.p  pIn general it is working delightfully well, however there is one major problem with it.  In the case where processes are communicating over two or more named pipes, the sending process and receiving process must open the pipes in the same order.  This is because when a process opens a named pipe, it blocks until the other end has also been opened.p  pI want a way to avoid this, without spawning extra helper processes for each pipe, without having to hack existing components, and without having to mess with the program networks to avoid this problem.p  pIdeally I am looking for some nonblocking fifo option, where open on a fifo always succeeds immediately but subsequent operations may block if the pipe buffer is full or empty, for read... Id even consider using a kernel patch to that effect.  According to fifo7 ONONBLOCK does do something different when opening fifos, not what I want exactly, and in order to use that I would have to rewrite every existing shell tool such as cat.p  pHere is a minimal example which deadlocksp  precodemkfifo a b gt a gt b  amp lt b lt a  amp wait codepre  pIf you can help me to solve this sensibly I will be very gratefulp

Negative 74269 pI have 4 pages in UIPageViewController and there are some inputs in each page. I would like to show alert when user change something on page and tries to swipe to other page. Alert should have two options stay or continue to next page. I was searching for this and I just found solutions which add alert when user tap or do something else and if should continue then segue is performed. But in UIPageViewController UIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScroll I dont have much options how to work with slide gesture. I am looking for some way that I could add code to viewWillDisappear and eventually stop disappearing if user taps stop. But in method viewWillDisappear its too late. Any ideas p
Negative 74269 pIm having an issue starting a daemonized Sidekiq process on a remote server with Mina.p  pI can start Sidekiq in a daemonized state when deploying, but outside of the deploy task the process silently crashes and does not log anything.p  pWhat Ive found is that if I add codequeue sleep 1code after my Sidekiq command in my start task then Sidekiq runs successfully in a daemonized state outside of the deploy task. i.e. I can run codemina sidekiqstartcode and it works. However, without the sleep, then codemina sidekiqstartcode starts the process but the process crashes before logging anything.p  pMy Sidekiq command isp  precodebundle exec sidekiq v d C varwwwcreamcurrentconfigsidekiq.yml P varwwwcreamsharedpidssidekiq.pid L varwwwcreamsharedlogsidekiq.log r varwwwcreamcurrentscriptboot.rb codepre  pHowever, Im confident that this is all correct, as I can run Sidekiq when I deploy and if I add codequeue sleep 1code at the end of my start task.p  pHas anybody come across this issue beforep  pp.s. Im using Mina with a plain Ruby project. There is no rails here, hence why Im not using the minasidekiq gem.p

Negative 74269 pI would like to get folks thoughts on the following approach, and perhaps even suggest better alternatives. p  pI have a weather simulation, and I want to be able to calculate specific properties as the simulation progresses. Suppose I have a Base Class codeWeatherSimcode from which different types of simulations derive. So I may have a codeConstantTemperatureWeatherSimcode or codeConstantPressureWeatherSimcode, etc.. p  pIn the case of codeConstantTemperatureWeatherSimcode I may be interested in how the average barometric pressure changes with time iterations in the actual simulation, and so on. I may also run the same simulations, where I want to monitor other properties, such as average velocity field vector, or some arbitrary quantity which I desire. p  pThe thing is, I need to calculate the properties in the most efficient way possible, since these simulations are strongverystrong computationally expensive. This means that while I can have a vector of property calculating functions, like thisp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeclass ConstTempWeatherSim      stdvectorltstdfunctionltdoubleModelampgtgt properties      void Iterate        Perform calculations...        Calculate properties      forautoamp property  properties           propertymodel  codepre  pThis approach is very inefficient. For the case of say, average pressure, I can loop though emallem elements in the model and get the pressure property on every iteration. A much more effective approach is to keep a running average. p  pThe thing is, I dont want to pollute my class with every possible calculable quantity and frankly I cant even if I wanted to, since I dont know what weird property a user may want to calculate.p  pMy solution to this problem was to use somewhat of a visitor pattern. My codeWeatherSimcode is a codeVisitablecode object, and the property I want to calculate is my codeVisitorcode. I store a vector of codeVisitorscode in my codeWeatherSimcode and each iteration I call the codeVisitorscode to do their thing. Each visitor will accept a reference to codeWeatherSimcode and so they can store their running average internally.p  pIn my mind that is a good way of solving this issue, except there are two other things I need to resolve, which is why Im here. p  ol lipSome properties are needed to perform calculations in a specific simulation. So for example, I may need to use pressure in my codeConstantTempWeatherSimcode as part of the algorithm. Should I just keep a running average of the required property separately from my codeVisitorscode and use those to augment the properties already computed by the codeWeatherSimcode Or should I have a private vector of codePropertyVisitorscode that I use for the necessary properties and have the user add anything else they need to a separate queue Is there some other waypli lipAfter each iteration, codeWeatherSimcode calls Observers to log the desired information. Whats the best way of getting the data from the codePropertyVisitorscode to the codeObservercode I dont think it would be wise to pass in a vector of references to the codePropertyVisitorscode themselves to the codeObserverscode. I was thinking that in my codeSimEventcode class, which contains information on the event, I could get the values  from all the codePropertyVisitorscode and store them in a vector in codeSimEventcode. Or am I barking up the wrong tree pli ol  pPerhaps the visitor pattern isnt the best approach to this. I would appreciate thoughts on how to approach this problem.p  pThank you all in advancep

If I try it too early though, it makes it even worse prolongs the waiting time to 5min the first time, 10min the second time and so on.p  pA collegue using Visual Studio 2013 Professional had the problem aswell while using the Express version, but it was fixed in the Professional version installing this version is not a possibility for me.p  pAll help is highly appreciatedp

In other words Should I rather use the timestamp value of when I load the data into elasticsearch as the elasticsearch rather than some constant value like codebitscode used in the above example.p  pAs my data does not have the timestamp inherently, What format should my timestamp that I am supposed to use as the codeindexcode have, If I shouldp

Negative 74269 pThis is a pretty long question in words, but it all adds up to one function.p  pFor some time, I have tried figuring out how to increment a variable, save it and then display it. Only problem is I figured out that to save the variable and allow all users on the website to see the same updated variable, it has to be saved server side, so now I have a big question as I have tried to figure out one thing, and now has to do it another way.p  pTo store a variable server side, is it enough to save the variable in a .php script because if so, I think what I am looking for is a way to have a variable in a .php script, then when a specific function is called I want to increment this variable by one, and then last I want to save this variable server side, to always be able to have the exact same variable on all users screens. The .php script is called by a form from the html script, so there is no problem there, the problem is as mentioned above, how to make a variable in .php script, increment that variable when a function is called, save that variable and then pass it back to the html page to display. p

Negative 74269 pIm trying to solve the following problem Given a sorted increasing order array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a BST with minimal height.p  pThe given answer takes the root node to be the middle of the array. While doing this makes sense to me intuitively, Im trying to prove, rigorously, that its always best to make the root node the middle of the array. p  pThe justification given in the book is To create a tree of minimal height, we need to match the number of nodes in the left subtree to the number of nodes in the right subtree as much as possible. This means that we want the root node to be the middle of the array, since this would mean that half the elements would be less than the root and half would be greater.p  pId like to askp  ol lipWhy would any tree of minimal height be one where the number of nodes in the left subtree be as equal as possible to the number of nodes in the right subtree Or, do you have any other way to prove that its best to make the root node the middle of the arraypli lipIs a tree with minimal height the same as a tree thats balanced From a previous question on SO, thats the impression I got, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29324245visualizingabalancedtree2932430429324304Visualizing a balanced treea but Im confused because the book specifically states BST with minimal height and never balanced BST.pli ol  pThanks.p  pSource Cracking the Coding Interviewp

Negative 74269 pIm working on a Spring Boot application. I want to provide a pretty rudimentary plugin system. Initially I was hoping itd be enough to just add the JAR to the classpath like sop  precodeURLClassLoader sysloader  URLClassLoader ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader Class sysclass  URLClassLoader.class  Method method  sysclass.getDeclaredMethodaddURL, URL.class method.setAccessibletrue method.invokesysloader, new File.pluginplugin.jar.toURI.toURL  SpringApplication.runApplication.class, args codepre  pIn the plugin.jar is a class annotated with codeControllercode and a RequestMapping. The context loads fine and the constructor of the controller is getting called as well. However, looking at the logs, I can see that the RequestMapping did not get picked up.p  pAdditionally, if I try to codeAutowirecode a JpaRepository in the plugin controller it fails complaining that it cant find the repository interface class which Im guessing is some problem that arose from me messing around with the ClassLoader.p  pJust autowiring the repository in my main application works fine though, so it shouldnt be an issue with its configuration.p  pIs there something Im doing wrong Can I maybe configure Springs ApplicationContext or its ClassLoader to make this work correctlyp  pTo summarise, I want to load some Controllers and maybe other Spring components at runtime from an external JAR in another folder.p

Negative 74269 pI am using JMeter to run stress tests against my MVC3WebApp, EF6.1, SQL AzureS2 application.p  pThe V11 and V12 instance are identical. Basically I used the same bacpac file. When creating the V12 instance I created the new SQL Server, and then imported the bacpac , choosing the S2 pricing tier. So both instance are the same apart from one is on a V11 server and the other is on a V12 server.p  pMy JMeter Test case has about 60 calls in it. Initially I run with one loop and then with five loops, and with differing numbers of concurrent users as followsp  precode1 User, 30 sec rampup, 1 loop   V11S2  550ms average 1 User, 30 sec rampup, 5 loop   V11S2  555ms average 1 User, 30 sec rampup, 1 loop   V12S2  755ms average 1 User, 30 sec rampup, 5 loop   V12S2  800ms average  5 User, 30 sec rampup, 1 loop   V11S2  620ms average 5 User, 30 sec rampup, 5 loop   V11S2  684ms average 5 User, 30 sec rampup, 1 loop   V12S2  800ms average 5 User, 30 sec rampup, 5 loop   V12S2  972ms average  10 User, 30 sec rampup, 1 loop   V11S2  868ms average 10 User, 30 sec rampup, 5 loop   V11S2  1317ms average 10 User, 30 sec rampup, 1 loop   V12S2  1000ms average 10 User, 30 sec rampup, 5 loop   V12S2  1686ms average  20 User, 30 sec rampup, 1 loop   V11S2  2422ms average 20 User, 30 sec rampup, 1 loop   V12S2  3000ms average codepre  pThe above test case has a mix of creates, updates and selects. Also the times represent the complete time for the request.  However, from looking at my NewRelic graphs I can see that the .NET component is minor and consistent, whereas the SQL server component is the major and variable one ie that is the one that shoots up when the user number increases.p  pI have seen writeups that one should get 25 speed ups. With the above results It seems I will migrate from Web Edition to V11, but not to V12. I would be interested if others have experienced the same or whether you could offer a reason or possible solution, excepting use of S3 or P1....p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI have done further testing with all of the compatibility levels ie 100,110 and 120, using the same test plan as above ie about 60 http calls. My original database was developed on SQL 2008, and was set at Compatibility Level 100. However there was neglible difference between compatibility levels on V12, and all performed poorly as against V11. Iep  precodeS2V11100 10 users, rampup 300 secs, 3 loops  632ms Av. Req.duration S2V12120 10 users, rampup 300 secs, 3 loops  1029ms  S2V12110 10 users, rampup 300 secs, 3 loops  1111ms S2V12100 10 users, rampup 300 secs, 3 loops  1088ms S2V11100 20 users, rampup 300 secs, 3 loops  1180ms  S2V12120 20 users, rampup 300 secs, 3 loops  4190ms  S2V12110 20 users, rampup 300 secs, 3 loops  4388ms S2V12100 20 users, rampup 300 secs, 3 loops  4269ms S2V11100 30 users, rampup 300 secs, 3 loops  2745ms  S2V12120 30 users, rampup 300 secs, 3 loops  7937ms  codepre  pSo it seems I can get an extra 10 users to operate concurrently on S2V11 on my DB than on S2V12 which is significant. So at present it seems that I am best to stay with V11 until I need S3. my only thought as to the cause is that the DB was developed using SQL 2008. Also I use Entity Framework 6, perhaps I need to tweak the configuration I believe not, never had to before.p

Negative 74269 pI have a MultipleChoiceField and for displaying the values that had been previous selected in the admin, I have to override method stronginitstrong from a ModelForm. I have the following class with its formp  precodeclass Profilemodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength64     contract  models.CharFieldmaxlength100  class ProfileFormforms.ModelForm     CONTRACTCHOICES           scholar, uScholar,         freelance, uFreelance,         contract, uContract,         volunteer, uVolunteer          contract  forms.MultipleChoiceFieldchoicesCONTRACTCHOICES      def initself, args, kwargs         initial  kwargs.getinitial,         initial[contract]  [scholar, contract, freelance] Here I would have to be able to get the attribute contract from the Profile class, not this list         kwargs[initial]  initial         superProfileForm, self.initargs, kwargs codepre  pWith the codeinitial[contract][scholar,contract,freelance]code works this values are shown as selected but I have to achieve this with the attribute contract from Profile. I know that you can access to the model from a ModelForm with the attribute eminstanceem, but theres one problem you can only have access to eminstanceem once the native method of init is called. And in this case, I have to call it later because otherwise it doesnt work for me. I already have tried to do it the following wayp  precodedef initself, args, kwargs     superProfileForm, self.initargs, kwargs     self.fields[contract].initial  self.instance.contract codepre  pBut that doesnt work it shows no errors but the selected attributes doesnt appear as selected. And furthermore, the following doesnt work eitherp  precodedef initself, args, kwargs     superProfileForm, self.initargs, kwargs     self.fields[contract].initial  [scholar, contract, freelance] codepre  pIt has only worked as the first way, but with the problem that I dont know how to access to the attribute contract. Any ideas Thanks in advancep
Negative 74269 pSo I am working on a homework assignment that requires us to take an integer array and create a parallel array of pointers that will then point to the corresponding element in the original array. We are then to sort the array of pointers into numerical order, and use a bubble sort in a function to do so. My question is, once the array of pointers is passed to the function, how do I dereference back to the value that the element pointer points to so that i can use comparisons in the bubble sort, switch values, and output the sorted arrays Am i right to pass the array of pointers into a pointer, or should I pass the actual array into the function Code as it is currently below.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  void sortint [], int void swapvaluesint , int    int main      int dataarray[]   0, 0, 0, 0, 123, 124, 125, 3000, 3000, 82, 876, 986, 345, 1990, 2367, 98, 2, 444, 993, 635, 283, 544, 923, 18, 543, 777, 234, 549, 864, 39, 97, 986, 986, 1, 2999, 473, 776, 9, 23, 397, 15, 822, 1927, 1438, 1937, 1956, 7, 29, 1      int ptrarray[100]     int flag1  0     int flag2  0     int flag3  0     int i  0     int j  0     int k  0     const int size  sizeofdataarray  sizeofint     for i i lt size i              ptrarray[i]  ampdataarray[i]          sortptrarray, size         return 0    void sortint ptrarray[], int size      int i  0     int j     for i i lt size i              j  0         for j j lt size1 j                      if ptrarray  j  ptrarray  j  1                              swapvaluesptrarray, j                          else                 continue                 void swapvaluesint ptrarray, int j      int holder     holder  ptrarray  j     ptrarray  j  ptrarray  j  1     ptrarray  j  1  holder  codepre

Negative 74269 pI am looking for the alternative design to singleton pattern given the following preconditionsp  ul liThere isare Spring managed beans which use some utility serviceli liThere isare POJOs which use the same utility serviceli liImplementation of service should be easy to mockswapli ul  pThere is codeJacksonMappercode which implements codeJsonStringConvertercode interface.p  pThe POJO is some custom object created by Builder pattern, like example bellow, that is using implementation of interface JsonStringConverter.p  precodepublic class User       private static final JsonStringConverter jsonStringConverter  JacksonMapper.getInstance      private String name     ...      private User User builder          this.name  builder.name           public String getName           return name           public String toJson           MapltString, Stringgt jsonMap  new LinkedHashMapltString, Stringgt          jsonMap.putUserAtributes.NAME.getDescription, this.name          return jsonStringConverter.toJsonjsonMap           public static class UserBuilder           private String name         ...       public UserBuilder nameString name           this.name  name          return this           public User build           return new Userthis          codepre  pSince instances of codeUsercode are not managed by the Spring, i cannot inject  implementation of codeJsonStringConvertercode into User with codeAutowirecode annotation.p  pOn the other hand, there are Spring managed Beans which use same implementation of that interface to convert some other maps to Json String. But since i already have an instance of converter cached outside Spring IOC, rather then creating new object inside IOC just for injection, i also poll it with getInstance in bean. This is the part i dont like at all.p  pThis is the Singleton in questionp  precodepublic class JacksonMapper implements JsonStringConverter       private static final ObjectMapper jsonToMap     private static final ObjectMapper mapToJson      private static final JacksonMapper INSTANCE      static               INSTANCE  new JacksonMapper         jsonToMap  new ObjectMapper         mapToJson  new ObjectMapper                Exists to defeat instantiation          private JacksonMapper       not called           public static JacksonMapper getInstance           return INSTANCE         methods...  codepre  pOptions i see right nowp  ul liLet JsonStringConverter be class with static methods for conversion from and to Json. Spring managed beans and POJOs can now use that Utility class instead of Singleton.li ul  pstrongConsstrong i would prefer to use explicit interface between codeJsonStringConvertercode and client code, for mocking and possibility to swap implementation easily.p  ul liUse Singleton pattern li ul  pstrongConsstrong requirement to have unnecessary object in memory to call method that should have been static to begin with.p  pCould somebody point me to a third reasonable option for the above situation p  pPlease note that this is general question, not tied to this specific use case, when there is dependency on same service for both Spring managed beans and POJOs.p

So clearly they are referred to the different things.p  pALL the thing happens in local machine.p  pAs this question is simplified from a network scenario, so for some reason, I dont want another class to manipulate those two threads, they are blind to each other. Perhaps the only thing they know for each other is that each thread running on the same local machine, plus, they know the port numbers of the other. Under such condition, I need some methodologies to create a data structure which both of them can see.p  pI also think of using memory address. Like one class get the memory address of the object, and the other get the object from the address and cast it to the correct data structure. Is it possible in javap  pAny help will be appreciatedp

Negative 74269 pStraight to the point Is it possible, in Python 3, to write a string to some binary stream without first holding a copy of it in memory encode, and without it being extremely slow.p  pBy slow, I mean that if I have e.g. a 300m string, it takes hundreds of milliseconds to encode it to utf8. In fact, it takes almost as long just to loop through and slice the string into 100k chunks. Thats only slicing, no encoding codefor ... s[ij]code which seems like i might be the memory allocation thats taking up most of the time, but I dont know how to verify that letalone work around it.p

Negative 74269 pFrom the a hrefhttpswww.gnu.orgsoftwaremakemanualhtmlnodeErrors.htmlErrors relnofollowdocsap  blockquote   pUsually when a recipe line fails, if it has changed the target file   at all, the file is corrupted and cannot be usedor at least it is not   completely updated.  Yet the files time stamp says that it is now up to   date, so the next time make runs, it will not try to update that file.   The situation is just the same as when the shell is killed by a signal   note Interrupts.  So generally the right thing to do is to delete the   target file if the recipe fails after beginning to change the file.   make will do this if .DELETEONERROR appears as a target.  This is   almost always what you want make to do, but it is not historical   practice so for compatibility, you must explicitly request it.p blockquote  pSo, here I have a makefilep  precode The idea here is to autogenerate the file make.include     and to use it as a makefile.

Computer engineering with okey results. I dont know why i seem to struggle so much with this. Its like every time i try to learn a Java Framework i wont even get to the point where i can apply my previous Java skills, because of dependency problems, deprecated classesmethods and different framework type problems.p  pCan anyone guide me on my way so that i perhaps can advance from making simple swingjavafxconsole applications to something elsep

Otherwise people see the link, click on it, and there might not be any comments.p  pSo the problem, I assume, is because using GROUP BY, it may or may not happen to show a record from the scores table that includes a comment.p  pI have tried using ORDER BY as well, but that just orders the results. Or using WHERE, but that only returns the lodges that have had comments. I thought HAVING might be it, but that just filtered the results again.p  pWhat I am looking for is to use GROUP BY, but for the summarised lodges rather than all results to be order by Comment so has if the lodge has any comments, I can use that to show or hide the link to the comments for that lodge.p  pI hope that makes sense, and might be possible.p  pThanks.p  pThis is my original queryp  precodeSELECT    scores.ScoreID,    COUNTscores.ScoreID as scoreCount,    AVGscores.Score as AverageScore,    lodges.LodgeID,      lodges.Lodge,    countries.Country,    lodges.CountryID,    categoriesFull.CategoryID,    nominations.NominationID,    scores.Comments,    nominations.AYfinalist,    nominations.AYrank,    lodges.2016Registered,    nominations.Year,    categoriesShort.CategoryShort,    countries.CountryShort FROM    lodges       INNER JOIN continents          ON lodges.ContinentID  continents.ContinentID       INNER JOIN countries          ON lodges.CountryID  countries.CountryID       INNER JOIN scores          ON lodges.LodgeID  scores.LodgeID       INNER JOIN nominations          ON lodges.LodgeIDnominations.LodgeID          INNER JOIN categoriesFull             ON nominations.CategoriesFullID  categoriesFull.CategoryID            AND scores.categoryID  categoriesFull.CategoryID            INNER JOIN categoriesShort               ON categoriesFull.CategoryID  categoriesShort.CategoryShortID WHERE        lodges.CountryID  8    AND scores.CategoryID  7    AND Year  2016    AND Nominee  Y  GROUP BY    Lodge codepre  pI have been trying sub queries, without any joy thoughp  precodeSELECT  FROM  SELECT    scores.ScoreID,    COUNTscores.ScoreID as scoreCount,    AVGscores.Score as AverageScore,    lodges.LodgeID,      lodges.Lodge,    countries.Country,    lodges.CountryID,    categoriesFull.CategoryID,    nominations.NominationID,    scores.Comments,    nominations.AYfinalist,    nominations.AYrank,    lodges.2016Registered,    nominations.Year,    categoriesShort.CategoryShort,    countries.CountryShort  FROM    lodges    INNER JOIN continents      ON lodges.ContinentID  continents.ContinentID    INNER JOIN countries      ON lodges.CountryID  countries.CountryID    INNER JOIN scores      ON lodges.LodgeID  scores.LodgeID    INNER JOIN nominations      ON lodges.LodgeIDnominations.LodgeID    INNER JOIN categoriesFull      ON nominations.CategoriesFullID  categoriesFull.CategoryID      AND scores.categoryID  categoriesFull.CategoryID    INNER JOIN categoriesShort      ON categoriesFull.CategoryID  categoriesShort.CategoryShortID   WHERE    lodges.CountryID  8    AND scores.CategoryID  7    AND Year  2016    AND Nominee  Y ORDER BY Comments ASC   AS Comments  GROUP BY    Lodge codepre  pThe above just lists one lodge with ScoreCount as the total number of all scores of all the lodges in that group.p  pIf I change the  to the fieldsp  precodeSELECT   scores.ScoreID,    COUNTscores.ScoreID as scoreCount,    AVGscores.Score as AverageScore,    lodges.LodgeID,      lodges.Lodge,    countries.Country,    lodges.CountryID,    categoriesFull.CategoryID,    nominations.NominationID,    scores.Comments,    nominations.AYfinalist,    nominations.AYrank,    lodges.2016Registered,    nominations.Year,    categoriesShort.CategoryShort,    countries.CountryShort  FROM  SELECT    scores.ScoreID,    COUNTscores.ScoreID as scoreCount,    AVGscores.Score as AverageScore,    lodges.LodgeID,      lodges.Lodge,    countries.Country,    lodges.CountryID,    categoriesFull.CategoryID,    nominations.NominationID,    scores.Comments,    nominations.AYfinalist,    nominations.AYrank,    lodges.2016Registered,    nominations.Year,    categoriesShort.CategoryShort,    countries.CountryShort  FROM    lodges    INNER JOIN continents      ON lodges.ContinentID  continents.ContinentID    INNER JOIN countries      ON lodges.CountryID  countries.CountryID    INNER JOIN scores      ON lodges.LodgeID  scores.LodgeID    INNER JOIN nominations      ON lodges.LodgeIDnominations.LodgeID    INNER JOIN categoriesFull      ON nominations.CategoriesFullID  categoriesFull.CategoryID      AND scores.categoryID  categoriesFull.CategoryID    INNER JOIN categoriesShort      ON categoriesFull.CategoryID  categoriesShort.CategoryShortID   WHERE    lodges.CountryID  8    AND scores.CategoryID  7    AND Year  2016    AND Nominee  Y ORDER BY Comments ASC   AS Comments  GROUP BY    Lodge codepre  pI get the error p  pUnknown column scores.ScoreID in field listp  pAm I barking up the right tree at allp  pMany thanks for any suggestions or pointers.p
