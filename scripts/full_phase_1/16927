Im not sure why lxml is calling into html5lib twice but I think it may be because for some reason it first tries to create a new instance of its own codeXHTMLParsercode before doing what Im actually asking it to do, which is just to create an instance of its own codeHTMLParsercode.p  pSo maybe the fact that it does make two calls to html5lib causes html5lib to sort of lock in the default codenamespaceHTMLElementsTruecode behavior that results from the first call, and then ignore the codenamespaceHTMLElementsFalsecode directive when it sees it in the second call.p  pMaybe in making two calls the way it does, lxml is either breaking some assumption in html5lib, or is actually misusing the html5lib API in a way that it by design is not intended to be used.p  pOr maybe the cause isnt at all the result of lxml making two separate calls to html5lib, but instead some other problem in the way its using the html5lib interface.p  pAnyway, Im interested in hearing from others about whether anybody else ahs run into this problem and has a workaroundor at least have some insight into why its happening.p

Positive 16927 pI am looking for a solution to parse html with Ruby. I need a solution similar to Apache Tika with an option to extract main content of any page, not just a particular website.p  pExamples. If that is a news article, I would be interested to extract an article with its title form a page skipping the rest. If its a StackOverflow question, I would only want title, question, replies. If its a picture with a title, I would only keep title. p  pBeing completely new to Ruby, I have looked at html parsing gems a hrefhttpswww.rubytoolbox.comcategorieshtmlparsing relnofollowherea that included Nokogiri and others. But I would really appreciate directly pointing me out how do I do it if thats possible.p  pWhile alternative solutions are interesting, I would like to mention that I cannot use Apache Tika as an app, but only in a server mode, so it does not provide an option to extract main context. On the other hand, main code that used to call Tika is in Ruby, so I need Ruby solution.p
Positive 16927 pIs there some type of limitation on Jsoups parsing. I have been dealing with memory issues which is another question I have open on this site, but started to realize that I am not even getting all the info I need.p  pI am using jsoup to parse an html page, its a test page and there is nothing but millions of numbers separated by white space. When I parse it with jsoup, I can get some of the text, but it wont get all of it.p  pFor example, if I have a codeString textcode that contains the html from .parse, it only has half of the numbers in the entire web page. If I go to the web page and grab the last number and call code.containscode on the codetextcode with the html, it will fail. But if I check code.containscode for a number thats half way in the html it passes, what is the meaning of thisp  pEven more weird, is if I parse the html and write it to text file, the text is empty except for the first few words on the page. The test page basically says test page then followed by millions of numbers, and in my text file it only says test page with no numbers, but there are 100 numbers because I can call .contains on the text to check which numbers are there.p  precode    html  Jsoup.connecturl.toString.get.html             Document doc  Jsoup.parsehtml             text  doc.body.text                      PrintWriter out  new PrintWriterfilename2.txt             out.writeJsoup.parsehtml.body.text             out.flush             out.close codepre  plast relevant test code p  pedit Wasted so many hours on this and the answer was as simple as this not able to parse complete html of a url using Jsoup.

Negative 16927 pIve recently inherited C console application that is in need of some pruning and clean up.  Long story short, the app consists of a single class containing over 110,000 lines of code.  Yup, over 110,000 lines in a single class.  And, of course, the app is core to our business, running round the clock updating data used on a dynamic website.  Although Im told my predecessor was a really good programmer, it obvious he was not at all into OOP or version control.p  pAnyway... while familiarizing myself with the code Ive found plenty of methods that are declared, but never referenced.  It looks as if copypaste was used to version the code, for example say I have a method called getSomethingImportant, chances are there is another method called getSomethingImortantJuly2007 the pattern is functionName[datestamp] in most cases.  It looks like when the programmer was asked to make a change to getSomethingImportant he would copypaste then rename to getSomethingImortantDate, make changes to getSomethingImortantDate, then change any method calls in the code to the new method name, leaving the old method in the code but never referenced.p  pId like to write a simple console app that crawls through the one huge class and returns a list of all methods with the number of times each method was referenced.  By my estimates there are well over 1000 methods, so doing this by hand would take a while.p  pAre there classes within the .NET framework that I can use to examine this code  Or any other usefull tools that may help identify methods that are declared but never referencedp  pSide question  Has anyone else ever seen a C app like this, one reeeealy big class  Its more or less one huge procedural process, I know this is the first Ive seen, at least of this size.p

Negative 16927 pTheres some debate here over which is better for referencing our common code base from other projects by project or by assembly.  Im in favor of referencing the project, especially since we have automated unit tests that prove that the common code does what it needs to.  p  pThe thought from the other camp is to lock down those projects and only release assemblies once a month or something.  Then force all projects to reference the assemblies.  They think this will protect them from deploying untested code.  They are too busy to write automated unit tests and configure their projects for continuous integration and I have no influence on that, so please do not focus on this aspect.p  pHeres the reasons I can think of why project references are the better solution.  Im looking for other opinions as well.p  pPROSp  ul liReferencing projects ensures you are working with the latest code.  You dont have to wait on anything.li liReducing duplication.  Without having the latest code, there is a greater chance of reinventing the wheel.li liIf a developer needs something and cant add it to the assembly where it belongs, it will be created in any location that will work, creating many inconsistencies and code duplication.li liDevelopment is easier because you can easily seedebug what is happening in the referenced code.li liOur common stuff doesnt change that often, but when it does, its usually something useful.

Negative 16927 pIm writing a live wallpaper, and Im forking off two separate threads in my main wallpaper service.  One updates, and the other draws.  I was under the impression that once you call thread.start, it took care of everything for you, but after some trial and error, it seems that if I want my update and draw threads to keep running, I have to manually keep calling their run methods  In other words, instead of calling start on both threads and forgetting, I have to manually set up a delayed handler event that calls thread.run on both the update and draw threads every 16 milliseconds.  Is this the correct way of having a long running threadp  pAlso, to kill threads, Im just setting them to be daemons, then nulling them out.  Is this method ok  Most examples I see use some sort of join  interrupt in a while loop...I dont understand that one...p
Negative 16927 pMy Flex application uses a clientside pimento EntityManager which fetches quite a few objects and associations. It does this by forcing eager fetching of particular association ends in the form of fetch plans. I would like to update the client whenever a change has been made to an entity existing in the EntityManagers cache. Is it possible to update the state of the changed entity ONLY, including updating which entities are associated, without resetting the state of these associated entities I have setup an EntityListener with a JPA postupdate method that notifies clients when a persisted entity has been updated. I want this to trigger a refresh for the modified clientside entity, but calling EntityManager.refreshentity resets all lazy associations to proxies. Initializing these proxies resets the associated entities, even if they were loaded previously. Im looking for an efficient way to keep the clients state in synch with the servers state, at least with respect to the entities that have already been retrieved by the initial load.p

I am making a website to show off my results and I would like to have a navigable slideshow with the normal play, pause, forward, rewind features.  I currently have a phpjavascript circular frame queue set up.  It works by having 10 frames contain images 110, then when the user wants to see images 2, change the view and load image 11 into frame 1 and so on.  This circular queue style works well for normal scrolling, but I would like to change the image every 100 ms and it bogs down.  Is there a better way to do this on this sidep  pMy main source of slowdown is that my images are dynamically plotted in GD from an xml file containing a large number of data points.

Negative 16927 pIn a recent project I had to create a Singleton class and after a lot of digging around on Google I came up with this template class definition. The idea is to derive from this template class and make the derived class constructor protected  private. It seems to work well but I have only used it with a single class in one project so I was hoping some of you could point out if Ive made mistakes in the implementation. Here it isp  precode   brief       Singleton design pattern implementation using a dynamically allocated singleton instance.     The SingletonDynamic class is intended for use as a base for classes implementing the Singleton   design pattern and require lazy initialization of the singleton object.

There are NSURLDelegate methods didFailWithError, etc which return the related NSURLConnection. The problem is that there is no NSURLRequest returned in the delegate methods and there is no NSURL accessor in the NSURLConnection.p  pThe solution Ive implemented is to maintain a NSMutableDictionary which pairs the URL string that was sent with the result of this NSURLConnections hash method.p  pIve tested it and it seems to work  the hash of the NSURLConnection that is returned in the delegate method is the same as the hash from the NSURLConnection that was sent initially.p  pMy question is it safe to do this Is there a better key to use than the hash Im asking because in my naive understanding, the hash is somehow associated with the address of that object in the memory, and it seems possible that backgrounding the app or turning the phone off and on may change this value as things are rewritten to memory.p  pThanks very muchp

Negative 16927 pI have an autocomplete on my site where a user enters a class at their school.  It then provides a dropdown of Classes that have the words they entered somewhere in their fields.  The Classes table has the fields ClassID, TermID, DepartmentCode, CourseCode, ClassCode, CourseTitle, Instructor which are all searched by the terms the user puts in.  Suppose a use enters the words international econ.  It would then search these two terms in the fields as followsp  precodeSELECT ClassID, DepartmentCode, CourseCode, ClassCode, CourseTitle, Instructor FROM Classes AND REPLACEREPLACEREPLACECONCATDepartmentCode, CourseCode, ClassCode, , , , , ,  LIKE international OR Instructor LIKE international OR CourseTitle LIKE international AND REPLACEREPLACEREPLACECONCATDepartmentCode, CourseCode, ClassCode, , , , , ,  LIKE econ OR Instructor LIKE econ OR CourseTitle LIKE econ LIMIT 10 codepre  pTwo quick notes on this query I do the REPLACE and CONCAT so that users can enter deptscoursessections as a unit, e.g. ECON101 A dept and a course together.  Also, Ive pasted a greatly simplified query which leaves out the way I currently sort and group.p  pHowever my question deals with how I can sort the results.  I want entries matching the ClassCode to be returned at the the top, followed by CourseCode, followed by Dept, then followed by CourseTitle, lastly by prof.  In other words, I want the results sorted by the amount of specfificity the user provides in the autocomplete.  If they know the ClassCode, Id therefore like it to be at the top.p  pI cant think of a way of doing this sort which doesnt require a huge query.  So far the only way I can think of doing it is aliasing a bunch of LIKE comparison for each term to each field, and then ORDERing by those aliases.  Thats equivelant to 5 times the number of words the user enters in the autocomplete.. In other words, a huge ugly query.p  pIs there a simple, efficient way to do this sort If there was something like an INSTR function which took strongmultiplestrong strings to search for, I could easily just compare all the words in the autocomplete to each field, and always sort on the 5 aliases produced by that.p  pAny input welcome, even if its a general suggestion that goes beyond the scope of the question.  However, in advance I want to note that Im not open to using something like FULLTEXT or a search system like Sphinx here because I dont feel its fit for a nonintensive, fast query like this one.  Also, Im not open to restructuring my database.  So Id like to do this with a good MySQL query on what I already have.p  pThanks in advance..p
Negative 16927 pthis is a bit of an odd question, so Ill start at the beginning...p  pMy needs for NSFetchedResultsController NSFRC are the ability to perform filtering and sorting after the objects have been fetched, mostly because the filtering and sorting require querying the fetched objects themselves, and is therefore not possible with NSFRC. So, I wrote my own class, BSFetchedResultsController, which aims to replicate the functionality of NSFRC delegate notifications, automatic sectioning and caching but with added hooks for the user to set their own blocks for filtering and sorting. The code for this class is on github here if anyone wants it a hrefhttpsgithub.comblindingskiesBSFetchedResultsController relnofollowhttpsgithub.comblindingskiesBSFetchedResultsControllera, although I wouldnt consider the class ready yet as a drop in replacement of NSFRC.p  pSo, Ive not yet implementing caching, mostly because Im not really sure how Apple has implemented it. The caches are stored in binary files herep  papp dirLibraryCaches.CoreDataCachesSectionInfoCachescache namesectionInfop  pSo, presumably, my class would need to store its caches in a similar location How is this structure organisedwork The cache needs to store the NSFetchPredicate or properties required to regenerate it, and it needs to archive the fetched objects somehow. But, NSManagedObject doesnt conform to NSCoding, so, how does it archive the objects And lastly during the NSNotificationCenterDidChangeNotification handler the cache needs to be updated.p  pSo, the real aspect of this is how to archive the fetched objects, Im leaning towards just saving the objectIDs in an array And then just get those objects from the context. Is that enough p  pIf anyone has thought about how to implement p

Negative 16927 pI feel my question is really n00b apologies if I dont word it clearly p  pIn my project Im using a 3rd party framework that fetches some data for me using asynchronous codeNSURLRequestscode RESTful API.  When the data is received and ready, delegate function codedidReceiveResponsecode is called. On error case codedidFailWithErrorcode is called.p  pThe problem is framework cannot queue requests, so if I call request methods sequentially I only receive the response for the last request issued. p  pNow the issue is that I cant change frameworks code. Given this is there any way of having a workaround for this problem Something like for a set of requests the emn1em request is not issued until request emnem is finished either codedidReceiveResponsecode or codedidFailWithErrorcode was called additionally, when the last request in a set is finished, I get a sort of notification. Ideally, the solution should by supported work for both iOS3 and iOS4.p

Negative 16927 pI have a little problem with the Flot plugin while displaying the xaxis labels in the graph. They are mode time. Currently I use Flot with the tooltip function and the tooltip contains a date and time. I supply a json to the plugin which contains timestamps. Afterwards I convert the timestamp and I display it in the tooltip.

Doing something like mousedown, determine the position of all droppable, mouseup determine if we are in a droppable position.

So, mousedown determines what is being dragged, and mouseup determines where it is dropped. Add some variable to make sure were dragging, and remember what is dragged.p

Negative 16927 pIm making a product review service using Google App Engine, and Im wondering about good practice for structuring my datastore models Im using the high replication setting, and Ive gathered that the way you structure entities and their ancestors is quite important. Particularly, Im wondering about using lists of keys or if I should be using ancestorsparents instead. My basic model looks like thisp  precode           Product            [reviews]  gt  Review                                  author  gt     User                                                                   [reviews]                                                                                                                                                                    codepre  pAs you can see, each product contains a list of reviews, and each user account also contains a list of reviews written by the user. My main questions are about these lists of reviews and whether its best to store them as lists of review keys, or whether its better to just generate them on the fly using queries.p  pIt seems that for the list of reviews related to a given emproductem, the best thing to do might be to create the Review entities as children of the given Product, and then just create the list of reviews onthefly when I need it using an ancestor query, e.g.p  precodereviews  db.GqlQuerySELECT                         FROM Review                        WHERE ANCESTOR IS 1                        ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 10,                        productkey codepre  pHowever, for getting a list of reviews written by a given user, I cant think of a way to do the same as above. It seems I would have to store a list of keys that pertain to each review the user has written. Is this correct If so, whats the best way to store a list of keys in GAE datastorep  pAny help or insight into this scenario as it relates to GAE datastore andor general database design would be greatly appreciated. Im pretty new to database design in general, so the more help the better. Thanksp

Negative 16927 pFor my first ASP.NET MVC 3 application, Im using the codeaspnetUserscode and codeaspnetRolescode tables to provide authentication for my users and for a few roles.  That seems to work pretty well.  Additionally, I want to make associations between the loggedin user and rows in various tables.  p  pAs a concrete example, Ive got a codeRecipescode table which has columns specific to recipes name, dates, attributes as well as a codeUserIDcode column.  That codeUserIDcode column is currently a foreign key to a codeUserscode table in my IceCreamDB NOT the codeaspnetUserscode table in the aspnetdb which contains various domainspecific information about users of the system.  So, its easy enough to create a query that retrieves all of Matts recipes, by creating a user in my Users table named Matt who has some integer UserId and then use that UserId during Creates and Updates to the codeRecipescode table.  Great.p  pTo tie the loggedin user itsmatt from the aspnetUsers table to my IceCreamDBs Users table UserId for Matt, I have a Guid column in IceCreamDB Users table which is filled in with the aspnetUsers Id its a Guid for the login.  p  pIceCreamDBs Users tablep  precode UserId     1                primary key used as FK for other tables   UserName   Matt  Phone      5551212  Department Product Development  Building   2A  Office     221  UserGuid   7fc75a6c7e3243f3be8cbe0122bf54cb  Guid from aspnetdb User table codepre  pAnd this works OK  as part of the user registration process, I create an aspnetUser, set up whatever roles e.g., Administrators, Owners, Production are appropriate, and then create a user entry in the IceCreamDB Users table, copying the Guid into the new row.  This lets me log into the website and see my recipes or my orders.p  pBut I feel Ive homebrewed this solution and theres likely a better, different approach to doing this. Id like some guidance on this. p

Negative 16927 pFrom my previous experience, Ive almost always had problems with linking files with my website projects. p  pFor example, linking CSS styles, Javascript files and including files in PHP. The problem is, that on my PC, the directory of my project was codewwwprojectnamecode and when I put the project on a server, the directory would be just codewwwcode. When I uploaded the project to a server, images wouldnt show, styles wouldnt work, database connections wasnt set, functions were not defined etc... p  pSo my question is strongWhat is the best and most efficient way to linkinclude filesstrongp  pSomething that will work no matter what the directory of the project is, and possibly, if I include codeprojectincludesmysql.class.phpcode in codefile1.phpcode, and I move that file to a different directory, it would still properly include codeprojectincludesmysql.class.phpcodep

Negative 16927 pWhat would be the most efficient way to find all ExtJS components that are rendered as descendants of a given HTML Element Note that this Element is not part of a component itself and is not managed by Ext in any way, it is just hardcoded raw HTML. And this Element may not only contain just ext components, it may have other nonext managed html in it as well, and that html can also contain ext components. So that means that the solution must traverse all the way down the DOM, not just look at direct children.p

Negative 16927 pI am developing a packet sniffer based on windows raw socket on windows 7. The program captures packet from IP layer. The issue i am facing here is, Program captures all packets but some of them are captured in wrong order, for eg. for a tcp connection establishment phase, instead of getting packets in SYN , SYNACK, ACK order i get it as SYN, ACK, SYNACK. Instead of capturing ACK after SYNACKfrom remote, pgm gets ACK before SYNACK packet. Same thing is happening  some times during data transfer phase also. Program captures the ACK packet of a data packet before the actual data packet.  If i run a wireshark in parallel, it displays properly.

Negative 16927 pFrom Gang of Four on the Template Method Patternp  blockquote   pThree implementation issues are worth noting p      ol   liUsing C access control. In C, the primitive operations that a template method calls can be declared protected members. This ensures   that they are only called by the template method. Primitive operations   that must be overridden are declared pure virtual. The template method   itself should not be overridden therefore you can make the template   method a nonvirtual member function.li   ol blockquote  pThis ensures that they are only called by the template method. is not true, is it As the primitive methods if some are virtual rather than pure virtual for example could also be called from a derived class. Is it not true that only declaring the primitive methods private ensures they are only called by the template method The private virtual primitive methods can then still be implemented or reimplemented in subclasses to provide the specialised behaviour which is required within the algorithm defined in the template method in the superclass.p  pSee Virtuality from Herb Sutterp  pa hrefhttpwww.gotw.capublicationsmill18.htmhttpwww.gotw.capublicationsmill18.htmap  pWhere he states thatp  blockquote   pGuideline 2 Prefer to make virtual functions private.    Guideline 3 Only if derived classes need to invoke the base implementation of a   virtual function, make the virtual function protected.p blockquote  pI dont see any requirement within the GoF Template Method pattern for derived classes to invoke base class implementations of virtual functions, so why do Gang of Four recommend making these functions protected rather than privatep

Negative 16927 pI have a multitouch application. It has 3 ccv applications sending udp packets to it. The application created receives all of these packets via ofxTuio which is mulitthreaded. These touches are then coming into the code we wrote on a single thread. We have display objects. They each have a list containing pointers to all of the objects they contain. For example we have written, onEnterFrame, addChild, removeChild functions similar to the display list syntax you would see with actionscript. We, however, are getting iterating errors concurrency issues on the objects list because of the multithreaded tuio events. How do we prevent this from happening. It seems as though locking mutex would not be right because these lists are not being accessed on multiple threads. I have created a custom queue for this list where they never iterate while objects are being removed or added to the list with a couple booleans and some extra lists for queueing. I suspect people have run into things like this, whats proper practicep

Negative 16927 pI really like the idea of the a hrefhttpdtrace.orgblogsbrendan20111216flamegraphsmysql relnofollowFlame Grapha for profiling since it will help in eliminating unneeded function calls. There is a catch however in that it requires the profiler to do a complete stack dump each time it collects a sample. This can be accomplished with DTrace or SystemTap quite easily, but I need to be able to do this on an ARM device running ubuntu which eliminates DTrace. I would also like to do this without recompiling the kernel which eliminates SystemTap.p  pIs it possible to get ValgrindCallgrind or OProfile or some other profiling tool that can run on an ARM device in Ubuntu to output something similar tobr codedtrace n profile1001 pid  12345 ampamp arg1  [ustack]  count codep

Negative 16927 pIm writing a Java program minimum compilable example below, and Im trying to pretty up the user interface by making some elements line up.  If you run this, you can see that codedipcode and codedpwordcode would look a lot better if I could make them the same size.  And I want them to dynamically stay the same size even when you resize the window.p  pGroupLayout has a codelinkSizecode method that lets you link the sizes of unrelated objects.  This works great with buttons and labels.  But with JTextField, its a disaster. Even if I set the minimum size on one of them to something large, it still insists on setting the sizes to zero.p  pIve also tried things like telling GroupLayout that the horizontal min and preferred sizes are codeGroupLayout.DEFAULTSIZEcode or codeGroupLayout.PREFERREDSIZEcode to no avail. Can anyone tell me if there is any way I can coerce JTextField to work properly with linkSizep  pNote that to turn on the linkSize, there is a line, labeled with a comment, that you need to uncomment.  When you do that, the JTextField widths get messed up. Also, try adding codedusernamecode to the  list of linked objects.  Now, even though theres tension, you might say, to make the usernamepassword row horizontally the width of the window, the fields go to zero size and wont resize.p  pThanksp  precodepackage textfield

For example, client emXem sends a line thats 16KB long even though the linelength limit is 1024 bytes. After reading more than 1024 bytes, I want to stop reading additional data, close the socket and raise an exception. Ive looked through the docs and some of the source code, and I dont see a way to do this without rewriting the readline method. Is there an easier way that Im overlookingp  pEDIT Comments made me realize I need to add more information. I know I could write the logic to do this without much work, but I was hoping to use builtins to take advantage of efficient buffering with memoryview rather than implementing it myself again or going with the naive approach of reading chunks, joing and splitting as needed without a memoryview.p

I started the code initially on a different platform.p  pIn some of my class headers I need to include a file which is specific to the other platform, however, this file doesnt exist in the Visual C workspace.p  pIve tried using code like thisp  precode if TARGET  OTHERPLATFORM  include themissingfile.h  endif codepre  pwhere TARGET is defined elsewhere as WINDOWSp  precode define TARGET WINDOWS codepre  pHowever, I still get a compiler error stating that themissingfile.h cannot be found.

Negative 16927 pI have a online tool where you can make presentations and then either preview them right online or download them for use later in a presentation. This have been done in flash.

I didnt want to tinker around in the s3Slider.js file because I thought Id just make it worse.p  pSecond, is there a way, perhaps using PHP sessions, to preserve the position of the slideshow ie. the current image between pages so that it doesnt just start over again each time you click a link Id like to have about a dozen images, but I feel that only the first few would ever be seen.p  pI have contacted the author, but he has not replied yet.p  pstrongEDITstrong I fixed the speed issue.

Negative 16927 pI have a PHP script where a user can upload an image.  This image is stored in the temporary directory and is returned to the user.  The user can then use a javascript interface to crop the image.  x1,y2x2,y2 is sent to the script which is used to crop the image.  It is then returned to the user for another preview andor crop.  Once the user is sufficiently satisfied he will click save.  The temp file is copied over to the original and the temp deleted.  These are not peruser images, but rather images of equipment.  Any user in the organization can replace any image of equipment.  This approach is good but there are a few issuesp  p1 Lets say the user uploads an image for preview but then closes the browser window.  I will be left with a temporary file.  This can become an issue.  Sure I can have a CRON clean them up but in theory I can have a ton of temporary files this is ugly.  The cron can also delete the users temp file during an edit.p  p2 To deal with number 1 I can always have a temporary file per piece of equipment, such as equip1.temp and equip1.jpg.  All uploads are stored in equip1.temp, all commits are transfered to equip1.jpg.  If two users are trying to upload pictures of the same piece of equipment at the same time this could mess them up highly unlikely  not an issue, but still uglyp  p3 I can always pass the image back and forth user uploads image and it gets echoed back as an codeltimg srcbase64..... gtcode.  The resulting edits  original base64 string are sent back to PHP for processing.  This solution relieves the temp file issue but I noticed it takes several seconds to send high res images back and forth.p  pHow would you deal with this situationp

Negative 16927 pI am going to have an ASP.net MVC web site example.com and a Web API site api.example.com running on the same domain. What is the best and most secure way to use Forms Authentication to allow a user to log in to the MVC site, and have that login accepted by the code[Authorize]code filter in the API site Additionally, there is the possibility that both sites will be hosted on multiple servers each of which might have its own subdomain, so a solution that would allow for a single sign on approach to work among all of the servers in the cluster would be preferred. p

Negative 16927 pAnswer found. See below. p  pIn the following code, I am updating about 350,000 records by linking some of the relationships. However, in the end, I examine the sqlite database, and only a fraction of the relationships are saved. The rest are still nil.p  pupdatep  pBefore describing the code in question, I should explain that the codedictionaryOfSynsetDictionariescode contains prefetched codesynsetcode objects. It is organized as a dictionary containing four dictionaries, where the keys are n, v, a, and r for the four parts of speech, or codeposcode. Each of the inner dictionaries contains references to the codesynsetcode objects, which are subclassed from NSManagedObject. p  pEach inner dictionaries is keyed by what is called codesynsetOffsetcode.p  pThe code below fetches all of the codeSYNSETPOINTERcode objects from the store and puts them into an array. Each codeSYNSETPOINERcode object refers to a codesynsetcode by the codesynsetOffsetcode and codepartOfSpeechcode codeposcode properties. It also contains a relationship that links the codeSYNSETPOINTERcode object to the codesynsetcode by matching codesynsetOffsetcode and codeposcode to the corresponding codesynsetcode in codedictionaryOfSynsetDictionariescodep  pSo now, after having prefetched and organized the codesynsetcode objects into the dictionary, the following code fetches all of the codeSYNSETPOINTERcode objects into an array, iterates over the array, linking synset pointers to their synset objects directly through the corresponding relationship.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfb6lf.png altenter image description herep  pThe picture above shows two relationships between the codeSYNSETcode and codeSYNSETPOINTERcode objects. This is based on the original dataset organization. They serve two different purposes. For this question, I am referring to the onetoone relationship.p  pend updatep  pHere is the code doing the updatesp  precode[request setEntity[NSEntityDescription entityForNameSYNSETPOINTER inManagedObjectContext[ManagedObjectContext moc]]] predicate  nil [request setPredicatepredicate] sortDescriptor  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeysynsetOffset ascendingYES] [request setSortDescriptors[NSArray arrayWithObjectsortDescriptor]] NSArray synsetPointersArray  [[ManagedObjectContext moc] executeFetchRequestrequest erroramperror]  int i  0 int j  0  forSYNSETPOINTER pointer in synsetPointersArray      NSString pos  pointer.partOfSpeech     NSString offset  [pointer.synsetOffset stringValue]     pointer.synsetPointer  [[dictionaryOfSynsetDictionaries objectForKeypos] objectForKeyoffset]     error  nil     if [[ManagedObjectContext moc] saveamperror]          NSLogerror with savenn,error.localizedFailureReason, error.localizedDescription         NSLogpause and quit          NSLogpos , offset , pointer , pos, offset, pointer     if j100          NSLog d, pos, i         j0          i     j  codepre  pHere, I am updating the property codesynsetPointercode for the pointer of class SYNSETPOINTER, a subclass of NSManagedObject.

Apparently no amount of encoding will do me any good before sending the body and header because it appears to be doing its own encoding and it appears to be totally incorrect.  I think this is a bug in codesendBodyAndHeadercode.  It encodes the ampersand back into the URI before sending it.  This is bad.  Why are we doing that  We have an application that reads files from one department and are written to a share and another system automatically picking those file up and delivering it when processing on the file is finished.p  pSee below camel codeURISupport.normalizeUriString uricode method is encoding the URI here and this puts the ampersand back into the file path.p  precodeURI u  new URIUnsafeUriCharactersEncoder.encodeuri codepre  pSo you see no amount of preprocessing on the file path in the URI is going to work at all because sendBodyAndHeader is going to do whatever it feels like doing.

Negative 16927 pI would like to pass C reference to CC codepointer, and than get it back from pointer to Creference. I have many pairs uint,Object. I created sorting mechanism in C code, because its much faster than C. There is only keyuint and valueobject reference needed. C code is using key for sorting, and is not changing the valuepointer. Is there any simple way to do it Do i need to use marshalling C function will be called many timesmaybe even a million times, so i am affraid it will be with marshalling too slow, and i dont even know how to do it with marshalling. I believe when objects address is changed by GC, address of C reference is not changed. So there will not be needed to place object in pined memory. Am i right about this Now i am able to call C function using DllImport, i am able to store C reference to C pointer, but i am not able to get address stored in C pointer to C reference.p  pAny ideas on how to do thisp

Negative 16927 pI have been unable to find a solution to this problem anywhere. I am using Xcode 4.5 to write an iOS 6 app using storyboards. It uses a Navigation Controller to jump between several View Controllers with Navigation Bars, including a few that use a UIWebView to display a website. I have added code to the AppDelegate and various ViewController files to restrict the view to Portrait for most scenes in the app since they really wont look good otherwise, but to allow Landscape view for the websites. And the Info.plist is configured allow all 4 orientations.p  pEverything works fine in the UIWebView scene including rotation, scrolling and zooming  except for one thing when I rotate from Portrait to Landscape, the horizontal dimension of the website stays locked at the horizontal dimension for the Portrait view  resulting in a large white space to the right of the website in the scene see images below. I fixed a small 14 white space at the top of the UIWebView by selecting Layout Wants Full Screen under View Controller in the Attributes Inspector. But I cant fix this.p  pI can supply relevant code or Storyboard settings if necessary. Can anyone help Thank you.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgGHSo.jpg altPortrait viewp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVGc2o.jpg altLandscape viewp

Negative 16927 pIn my application there are several services that process information on their own thread, when they are done they post a message to the next service which then continue to do its work on its own thread. The handover of messages is done via a LinkedBlockingQueue. The handover normally takes 5080 us from putting a message on the queue until the consumer starts to process the message.  To speed up the handover on the most important services I wanted to use a busy spin instead of a blocking approach I have 12 processor cores and want to dedicate 3 to these important services. So.. I changed LinkedBlockingQueue to ConcurrentLinkedQueuep  pand didp  precodefor   Message m  queue.poll  if m  null    ....  codepre  pNow.. the result is that the first message pass takes 1 us, but then the latency increases over the next 25 handovers until reaches 500 us and then the latency is suddenly back to 1 us and the starts to increase..

The materials chosen for this estate were brick or plaster for walls and structural bays, and pressure treated fir for the wood spans. These materials, along with brick or quarry tile flors, provide a relatively neutral background. The resulting expression is directly that of the sturdy but graceful nature of the masonry against the more tenuous and taut nature of the wood. The site commands a megnificent view of English Bay, the North Shore mountains of West Vancouver and the downtown Vancouver skyline to the east. Private south facing courtyards trap the sun and serve as entry courts from the strets. One outdoor and one indoor swimming pool were incorporated for individual owners as well as several roof gardens.ltpgt         lth4gtThe Unitlth4gt         ltpgtThis is a rare residential offer on the Golden Mile built during one of Ericksons most creative periods.

Negative 16927 pI am just getting started with GWT development using Maven as a build system.p  pI come from the Java  Flex world, so naturally I have client side modules and server side modules that are cleanly separated. p  pWhile digging into the bestpractices og GWT and digging deeper and deeper, to me the default configuration of GWT projects feels more and more like a total mess of responsibilities. Especially when it comes to multimodule projects.p  pI did understand, that the convention states that serverside logic belongs in server packages, shared code in shared and stuff that is compiled to HTMLJavaScript by the GWT compiler in client packages. And all code goes to srcmainjava. So far so good.p  pNo matter how I try to see it ... to me stuff in the client packages is simply deadcode. Even if the java compiler compiles this to classes, the classes are never used at runtime and are only needed to provide input to the GWT compiler in the compilation phase. So even if it looks like Java, its actually not and only looks like Java. It sort of feels dirty to place these inside the same jars as live code.p  pWouldnt a maven structure like this make more sensep  precodesrc srcmain srcmainjava srcmainshared srcmaingwt codepre  pAnd to have the javacompilerplugin use srcmainjava and srcmainshared and the GWT compiler to use srcmaingwt and srcmainshared p  pAlso it would feel a lot better if the build would produce two types of artifacts ... normal jars containing clases from srcmainjava and srcmainshared and a second gwt, which contains classes and sources of srcmaingwt and srcmainshared. p  pI wouldnt add a dependency to some mixedup jar, but could decide if I want to import some GWT components or if I want to import some serverside functionality.p  pNext thing is that the GWT default is to place xml, resources and other stuff in srcmainjava ... XML ampamp Resources  Java p  pOr is there a real reason for all of this, that I simply havent realized yet ... or do I simply have to start getting dirty and not worying about stuff like thatp  pChrisp

Negative 16927 pmy question is probably simple for most but its troubling me and ive been googling for sometime now. p  pIm trying to create a product on this following website for a clientp  pa hrefhttpswww.anigmabeauty.co.nzindex.phpoptioncomvirtuemartampviewcategoryampvirtuemartcategoryid1ampItemid235 relnofollowhttpswww.anigmabeauty.co.nzindex.phpoptioncomvirtuemartampviewcategoryampvirtuemartcategoryid1ampItemid235ap  pI want to create another Voucher called 100 Gift Voucher with that voucher set at 100.00 obviously. when the viewer clicks on this I want to have a Enter Amount box where the viewer can enter the amount they want to pay for a Gift Voucher. for example if they wanted a 210.00 Gift Voucher, they simply enter 210.00p  pI managed to do this with custom fields but it then adds the amount entered eg. 210.00 onto the 100.00 which I dont want. If it is possible I would like the 100 Gift Voucher set to 0 dollars and whenever the viewer types in the value they want eg. 210.00 and then go to the Shopping Cart the Total amount will be 210.00p  pAny help would be AMAZINGp  pThanksp
Negative 16927 pI find it difficult to find a good title I hope I can explain it better. I have two tablesp  precodecar  id, carid, name carpictures  id, fkcarid, url codepre  pObviously a car can have several pictures those are linked by the carid saved as fkcarid in the carpictures table. Workflow in a frontend could bep  precode you add a new car to the database  you add pictures to this car entry codepre  pIf followed this way you first create a new entry in the car table. Then you have a carid you can reference in the carpictures table.p  pBut what if you like to change the workflow like thisp  precode you add a new car  you immediately add pictures  you save the new car to the database codepre  pIf followed this way you do create the database entry only if the user has finished all steps. But if you want to add pictures to the car there is no carid for it yet. So you cant reference the id.p  pWhat is the usual way to do this if adding the car and adding the pictures are two seperate api calls for example.p  pIt seems I need to clarify what I am doing. Lets say I have two api calls www.domain.comapicaraddnamenewcar  for adding a car ie. adding to the database www.domain.comapicarpictureaddcaridx  for adding a picture to a car ie. handle the upload and put data to the databasep  pThe frontend would look like this A page with a  table with all cars which you can edit and add new pictures to it in another page. Another page to add a new car which also has the possibility to add picture. This would be the same pageform as editing a car only that no carid is available.p  pEditp  pI myself can think of several ways to handle this case.p  pfirst create a database entry for a car immediately when the user opens the add new car form. that way you always have a carid. but you have to handle if the user decides to cancel adding a car and need to remove those dummy database entries. if something goes wrong there you may end with a lot of empty car entries in the database. maybe the row has a flag that is set when the car is actually inserted by the user.p  psecond insert new pictures with temporary negative fkcarid and update those rows with the actual carid if the row is created in the database.p  pthird save new pictures into a temporary table with a temporary id when there is no carid yet. then you have to return that temporary id and moved those entries from the temporary table on the creation of a car entry in the database.p  pBut those ideas sound complicated and I hoped there is some best practice way how to do it. Maybe the problem is in my workflow itself and there is a better way to do it. Yet it seems to be a good idea to separate the process of adding a car and adding pictures to a database.p

Negative 16927 pI am writing a web application in Visual Studio 2010 using C.

Negative 16927 pThere are several questions on SO regarding how to create a prebuild step for codeqmakecode, I can do that with this in my code.procode filep  precodeversionTarget.target  ..VersionDataversioning.h versionTarget.depends  FORCE win32 versionTarget.commands  cd PWD python.exe .versiongetter.py p TARGET else  versionTarget.commands  cd PWD python .versiongetter.py p TARGET  PRETARGETDEPS  ..VersionDataversioning.h QMAKEEXTRATARGETS  versionTarget codepre  pNow, the problem is that this approach is not a build step per se but just another build target, so if I have the codejcode flag configured for codemakecode it runs my script in emparallelem with the other build jobs.  This is very bad, because my script createsupdates a header file  having it change part way through the compilation is not acceptable.p  pSo, is there anyway I can have this script executed before emanyem compilation is ran  I know I can create another script and call the codeversiongetter.pycode and codeqmakecode in sequence from that, but this is not desirable as I would have to compile from the command line rather than from within Qt Creator.p  hr  h2Updateh2  pThe complete code.pricode file that is included by every one of my subprojects is belowp  precodeCONFIG  thread QT  core        gui  versionTarget.target  ..VersionDataversioning.h versionTarget.depends  FORCE win32 versionTarget.commands  cd PWD python.exe .versiongetter.py p TARGET else  versionTarget.commands  cd PWD python .versiongetter.py p TARGET  PRETARGETDEPS  ..VersionDataversioning.h QMAKEEXTRATARGETS  versionTarget  DEPENDPATH  ..VersionData INCLUDEPATH  ..VersionData HEADERS  ..VersionDataversioning.h  UIHEADERSDIR  PROFILEPWDincludeQui DESTDIR  SYRENPATH  win32msvc      QMAKECXXFLAGS  stdc0x  codepre  pBut this still results in the same parallel behaviour.

Negative 16927 pSo as advised I am extending my earlier question to pick up the username of the system opening my web page and then authenticating that user accordingly. Thanks to some useful advice and after long hours of reading and testing I managed to write a very simple Java Applet which I embedded in login.xhtml page. However, now Im stuck over next appropriate step in order to pass the username picked up by the java applet to the login managed bean. Allowing my web page to authenticate user based on their systems username without user actually having to put his username in the login.xhtml page. Meanwhile trying to search for the next appropriate step I feel my understanding going up and down and sideways. What best i could pick is that now in order to pass the username picked up from java applet to the login bean I will have to write JavaScript But I am not sure if this is really what is required or there is another appropriate step to handle this more elegantly.

Negative 16927 pI am working on a Java JSE 7 application that receives a private key in SSLeay format from an external server and needs to construct a java.security.PrivateKeyderived object.

Negative 16927 pOver the last few weeks Ive been reading anything I could get my hands on about authentication and the different methods for securing and authenticating a user through a RESTful service, more specifically asp.net web api. This is really my first dive into http authentication and the more Ive read the more confused I get.p  pLet me give some details on the application infrastructure of my project...p  pIm building a RESTful service that will serve as the data access layer for a web application. The application itself will pretty much be a SPA built off of AngularJS. User login and CRUD operations will all be handled through the API and done over http NOT HTTPS.p  pIve read a lot of different articlesexamples and I think I have a direction that makes sense for my goals. Id like my approach to be similar to how Amazon Web Services does their authentication, and theres a a hrefhttpwww.thebuzzmedia.comdesigningasecurerestapiwithoutoauthauthentication relnofollowgreat articlea on The Buzz Media that specifically describes how they do their authentication at a high level. I also found an a hrefhttpforums.asp.nett1837229.aspx1ASP20NET20Web20API20oAuth5122653 relnofollowexamplea that closely resembles the high level description from the article specifically the server code section.p  pBut there are some things that Im confused about...p  ol liWhen the user logs in through the client Angular in my case the client will create a hash using the users password. The hash will contain the apikey, and a secret that only the api and client know. How is the secret obtained by the client when logging in It seems like a request would first have to be made before logging in to get the secret, then create the hash and send another request to authenticate the user A code example would be VERY helpful.li liWould I use a DelegatingHandler or create a custom Attrubite that I would decorate each controller with Whyli liOnce the user has been deemed authenticated I would then create a nonce which would be stored in the database for that user and returned in the response. The client would use this nonce in their next request. In the server code example link above the nonce is generated but is never sent back to the client. The example uses a custom Attribute, but Im confused on how this nonce would be returned to the client in the response Again, a code example would be VERY helpful.li liFrom there on out its just the client hashing the apikey, nonce and data with every request and the API service sending back a new nonce in the response Am I missing somethingli ol

Negative 16927 pCan you any help me with this issue. I have installed haproxy loadbalancer. it is working perfect, but the problem is other. When the application connect to the backend server direct without loadbalancer and the server is down, the application say trying to reconnect  this is good, because a user know that the server is down. But wenn application is connect to loadbalancer and server is down, the application staying open and dont say trying to reconnect. This is because the app is connect direct to haproxy and the app think, that everything is ok with connection. Do you have any ideas how to make haproxy to be disable or service to be shutdown when all backend servers are down and of course when some of the servers are up, haproxy to be up also p

Negative 16927 pIm unclear about Androids UI mechanism to go back one screen.  I have read the docs and I understand that the hardware back button should serve to do just that. Meanwhile, the Action Bar in ICS serves as an up button if the activity has multiple entry points.  This leaves me with two questionsp  ol liI notice many Android apps use the left side of the Action Bar go to back anyway in addition to the hardware back button. Should I do this with my app meaning there will be two ways to go backli liDo Android users naturally use the hardware button to go back, or do they expect a nav button at the left side of the Action Bar to go back a la iOS  It seems like having to resort to the hardware button below the screen to go back is a pain in the ass for users especially on tablets  Is this really what Android UI guidelines prescribe  Thank you.li ol
Negative 16927 pThis question generally applies to the standard DataGridView. For some reason it will always select a cell after sort, even if there is no cell selected selection was cleared at the moment the user clicks on the column header to sort the DataGridView. To explain why I really dont want this, I need to provide a little more background about my project. p  pI need to extend the functionality of the DataGridView, while keeping databinding intact. Firstly, I need to organize the data into expandablecollapsible groups. Later, other functionality already written specifically for the DataGridView by others will be added. This means I do not have the freedom to use a thirdparty grid component that isnt built around the DataGridView. p  pTherefore Ive decided to use the DataGridViewGrouper component written by HotDog Robert Verpalen, see a hrefhttpblogs.vbcity.comhotdogarchive200812199225.aspx relnofollowthis linka for his code. In this component collapsed rows are hidden by setting their visible property to false.p  pIn principal it works, until I try sorting the data after having selected one of the group rows. In that case it throws an error ArgumentOutOfRangeException. I thought Id take a shortcut to solve this problem and added p  precodeprivate void dataGridView1CellMouseClickobject sender, DataGridViewCellMouseEventArgs e  if dataGridViewGrouper1.CurrentRowIsGroupRow              dataGridView1.ClearSelection       codepre  pThere is no reason why users would have to be able to select one of the group rows, and clearing their selection gets rid of the error I got when I tried to sort.  However, after sorting, there is always a cell that gets selected even if the selection was cleared before the sort. p  pIve added a CellMouseDown event to keep track of which cell was last selected before sorting, so that after the sort I can select the same cell again and not the cell that happens to sit at the same row index.p  precodeprivate void dataGridView1CellMouseDownobject sender, DataGridViewCellMouseEventArgs e  if e.RowIndex  1              if dataGridView1.SelectedCells.Count  0  return           selected  dataGridView1.Rows[dataGridView1.SelectedCells[0].RowIndex].Cells[0].Value.ToString       codepre  pI return from this method if there are no selected cells there is after all nothing to be remembered. The fact that this return does indeed occur if a sort is attempted after a group row was last selected, means my attempt to clear that selection was successful.p  pHowever, after the sort a cell is still selected in this case. This is a seemingly random chosen cell somewhere in the group. I suspect it is somehow related to the position of the cell that was selected before the selection was cleared. This leads to rather annoying behavior, like the screen jumping to this selected cells position a few hundred lines away or an invisible row in a collapsed group becoming visible as it is selected. p  pI cant find out during which event the cell is selected. Ive tried to keep track of which group row was selected before the sort, so that I can later select something else and if necessary make all the rows in that group invisible again, but I didnt manage. I also feel this isnt the right way to fix this problem. p  pSimilarly, working with loops to select the closest by visible data cell before going into the sort action rather than clearing the selection, doesnt seem like a great solution. Especially because I would still have a problem when all groups are collapsed there are no visible data rows.p  pWhat I really want I think is to stop a cell from being selected after a sort, if there wasnt one selected before the sort. Can someone please help me with thatp

Negative 16927 pI have a pretty simple question that Im hoping someone can point me in the right direction on. Im a java developer trying to figure out the correct objective C approach to a global lock. I have a class which is instantiated in several place.

In java this would be done as followsp  precodestatic Object lock  public void writeToFile     synchronizedlock       thread safe code goes here       codepre  pThe static identifier would mean that the lock object is shared across all instances and would as such be threadsafe.

Negative 16927 pI have a string of 1s and 0s that i padded with enough 0s to make its length exactly divisible by 8. My goal is to convert this string to a number of bytes and order it in such a way that the first character i read is the least siginificant bit, then the next on is the next least siginificant, etc until i have read 8 bits, save that as a byte and the continue reading the string saving the next bit as as the least siginificant bit of the second byte.p  pAs an example the string 0101101101010010 is length 16 so it will be converted into two bytes. The first byte should be 11011010 and the second byte should be 01001010.p  pI am unsure how to do this because it is not as simple as reversing the string i need to maintain the order of these bytes.p  pAny help is appreciated, thanksp

If so, how can I do that pleasep  pAlso thought about having sitedatetime composite column headers as that allows me to filter for those properties nicely. Then I could have the row keys as param  param value composite keys and build a set of userids as values.

Negative 16927 pI was always taught to use IDs in my code to refer to records into the database.p  pBut lets take the case we have same roles in the table Role. Now I want to query only the records related to the role Playerp  precodeID    ROLE 1     Admin 2     Organizer 3     Player codepre  pI dont know in my code the ID of Player, but I want to retrieve all the players, so with Hibernate I wrote    p  precodeString queryString  from User u where u.role.role   Query queryObject  getSession.createQueryqueryString queryObject.setParameter0, player return queryObject.list codepre  pAs you can see I wrote player in the code. I think this is not the best way and I should use an ID instead. But I dont know the ID and it may change depending on the server on which I run the application. A second problem with my solution is that player can be capitalized into the database and this may be changed over time.p  pSo, what should be the solution to all these problems Is there any way to use the ID instead Or any other way to improve this codep

Negative 16927 pIve had good experience with Spring MVC REST with a couple of solid projects delivered. My question is about JAXRS compliance.

Negative 16927 pI have implemented a Play 2 QueryStringBindable in Scala for a Range type. A Range consists of either a min or max value or both of type Float. In my QueryBindable implementation I use the internalBinder to convert the two possible parameters min  and max to Option[Either[String, Float]], combine them in a tuple, do a pattern match over this and finally return an Option[Either[String, Range]]. This works but as you can see in the code below the pattern match is very verbose.

Than for each codePointcode, I check all his neighbors [x1,y], [x1,y], [x1,y1], [x1, y1], ... and store them in neighbors vector for that codePointcode. p  pThen, by the size of the neighbors vector, I determine if the Point is a strongnodestrong 3 or more neighbors, a strongtipstrong 1 neighbor, or just some basic point 2 neighbors. p  pAnd here comes the part, where I have no idea how to implement some path finding to check whether there is a way for example from a tip point to the closest node point. p  pWhat is more, I have no idea if my tree representation is good probably is not.

Negative 16927 pMy Enemy class has several methods, e.g. codewalkAnimationcode and codedeathAnimationcode, that return instances of SKAction. Because these SKActions involve coordinating basic actions on many child nodes of the Enemy node, coderunActiononChildWithNamecode seems to be the way to manage this.p  pHowever, according to the documentation and to experimentation, codeSKAction runActiononChildWithNamecode is instantaneous. That means if such an action is present in a sequence, the next action will fire immediately, instead of waiting for that child action to complete. Similarly, if there is a completion handler, that would be invoked immediately. So effectively, coderunActiononChildWithNamecode is nothing more than shortcut for a coderunBlockcode action, just like coderemoveFromParentcode is.p  pAs a concrete example of the problem I face, say I have a composite death animation. The sprite backing my Enemy flashes red, and then the Enemy itself is removed from the scene. I cant use codecolorizeWithColorcolorBlendFactordurationcode on my Enemy directly, since that action only operates on SKSpriteNode instances. I cant use coderemoveFromParentcode on Enemys Sprite node, since that wouldnt completely remove this Enemy instance from the scene. So coderunActiononChildWithNamecode is needed.p  precodeSKAction deathAnimation      SKAction flashRed  [SKAction colorizeWithColor[UIColor redColor] colorBlendFactor1.0 duration0.2]     return [SKAction sequence[                                 [SKAction runActionflashRed onChildWithNameSprite],                                 [SKAction removeFromParent],                                 ]]  codepre  pWhen I run this SKAction, my Enemy node immediately disappears without flashing red. The reason is that coderunActiononChildWithNamecode does emnotem have a duration of code0.2code. Its duration is instant. Similarly if my SKScene were to use code[enemy runAction[enemy deathAnimation] completion ... ]code, that completion block would be invoked immediately.p  pI would hate to switch to a lesser design. My Enemy class returns codeSKActioncode instances to give the SKScene precise control over the coordination and composition of these actions. An important aspect to this is being notified of the completion of such actions. coderunActiononChildWithNamecode is certainly not up to that standard.p  pOne hacky solution would be to include a code[SKAction waitForDuration0.2]code in the sequence between coderunActiononChildWithNamecode and coderemoveFromParentcode. Its not ideal though. Is there a chance that the codewaitForDurationcode and codeflashRedcode actions could finish on different iterations of the run loop That doesnt really matter for this case, but as soon as you involve multiple actions with multiple completion handlers, I worry about the race conditions might cause.p  pDo I have other options besides codewaitForDurationcodep
Negative 16927 pI am using codeImageViewcode to make a 1.3 MB image as background for an activity. The activity has another smaller image the logo and 3 buttons. There is nothing else in that activity. Now this activity takes upto 9 seconds to display. Till then the app shows a black screen.

Negative 16927 pEditp  pThis seemed like a pretty good question and now I see that there might be a way more straight froward answer than what I just spent the entire day coding up.p  pI found reference that you can put this in the .htaccess file and the search engine will not index the pdf files.

Lately Google has been linking to the pdf instead of the web page that has the embedded and the ads.  Seems crazy as they are Google ads but nice for the user I guess.  My revenue has dropped in half.  I can make the web results go to another page by creating a directory called .pdf and putting a file index.php with the appropriate header redirects.  In the new file I can rename the pdf but this just delays the problem to when they index the new location. Doing this to 700 files is not something I want to do every week.p  pI have considered translating the pdf files to html and have tested zamzar windershare, somepdf, intrapdf and none of them do a good job.  Some of the translations were almost readable, some just a white page, some a black page, one was a black page with some blotches here and there. I tried an online service a few hours ago and have yet to get the email with my file.p  pI am not set on pdf to html, it is just what I could think of.p  pPerhaps there is a better solution.  Others must have this problem and have solved it somehow.  Obviously I need the page searchable as well so just converting everything to images isnt a solution.  I dont know what to do.p

The question is, how do you use token to authenticate user to your own server p  pIm thinking something like creating a cookie that maps to a token, so when user acts, each time Ill get a cookie and I know that this is user A.

Negative 16927 pI have a SSIS job that runs under a schedule on SQL Server 2008 R2.  Ths job takes multiple commaseparated text files and imports them into SQL tables.  I created this SSIS package about 4 years ago and I have periodically updated it without issues.  I recently had to make a minor change to one data flow task.  This worked fine on my machine, but when I put the job on the server, it errored out.  On closer inspection, the reason it errored out was that the values it was trying to put into SQL tables all included quotation marks around the values.  This would cause errors on the nonstring values like integer types or just bring the quotes in on the string fields.p  pMy source text files do contain quotation marks around some of the values.  Here are two example linesp  p5365181,A120,B002209A12,AA,011614,3,0.000,1555.50,0,0,UA,121713,,KS,A,04,1,MNS,AMp  p5400391,G040,YPCILANHAS224,Y,011614,2,0.080,905.28,0,0,SM,011614,,,A,02,1,MNA,AMp  pTherefore, on my Flat File Connection Manager, I have the Text qualifier set to quotation marks, like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfJ9xO.png altTextQualifierp  pWhat is really strange is that the data flow task that is having issues is not the one I modified.  I did not change the SQL table definitions in any way.  In the end, I added derivied columns in my DFT to strip out the quotation marks manually.  Examplep  precodeREPLACE[Column 0],, codepre  pSince this has to be done for each row, I had to to this 18 times, which was pretty annoying.p  pAnother really strange symptom is that this works fine from my laptop.  If I run my SSIS job on my laptop and update the same tables on my production server, it works fine no quotation marks.  It is only when the job is run automatically via a scheduled SQL job that this issue occurs.p  pI would emgreatlyem appreciate any suggestions anyone might have.p  pThank youp

Negative 16927 pI have a C program which uses gccs codeuint128tcode which is great, but now my needs have grown beyond it. What are my options for fast arithmetic with 196 or 256 bits The only operation I need is addition and I dont need the carry bit, i.e., I will be working mod 2192 or 2256.p  pSpeed is important, so I dont want to move to a general multiprecision if at all possible. In fact my code does use multiprecision in some places, but this is in the critical loop and will run tens of billions of times. So far the multiprecision needs to run only tens of thousands of times.p  pMaybe this is simple enough to code directly, or maybe I need to find some appropriate library. What is your advice, O great StackOverflowp  pClarification GMP is too slow for my needs. Although I actually use multiprecision in my code its not in the inner loop and runs less than 105 times. The hot loop runs more like 1012 times. When I changed my code increasing a size parameter so that the multiprecision part ran more often vs. the singleprecision, I had a 100fold slowdown mostly due to memory management issues, I think, rather than extra ops. Id like to get that down to a 4fold slowdown or better.p

Negative 16927 pIm new to Angular but have experience with ASP.NET MVC so the basic concepts here are not new to me.  I am trying to pass a simple text parameter to my WebAPI controller something like the word park, the WebAPI controller then would do a linq query and return the results to Angular which would display those results with ngrepeat in a veiw.  It works fine in the case where I return all the rows from the database but when I try to pass in a keyword parameter nothing happens.

I am looking for some assistance in the best way most efficient using a linear time algorithm to determine if the current position is within one of the bnonoverlappingb regions.p  pLets assume I have the following to determine the user defined regions I scan the document at the start using regex to determine the regionsp  precodeREGION START  0, END  20 REGION START  21, END  24 REGION START  34, END  40 codepre  pI dont care what region the user is in, I just need to determine if they are in or out of a region, given position X. I could store the regions as an array and loop through the entries until I find one that matches, but this isnt linear time and would take longer if it didnt match a region.p  pIs there an easier way to do this using an algorithm or storing the data in a certain wayp

Negative 16927 pI have build a generic data converter for my service layer and I am now trying to build interfaces so that I can use dependency injection Autofac to do the binding.

Needless to say its the final declaration that I need for dependency injection to work and also because its how I want to declare it anyway.  p  pIt is a limitation of interfaces or have I simply missed somethingp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThanks D Stanley and others for pointing out my misunderstanding. I think you can see what I am trying to do, which is build a generalised data to DTO and DTO to data converter. The code works fine, with the help of AutoMapper. I have updated the code to include the GenericDto which each DTO inherits.p  pThe question was not well thought out and I am sorry for that. I have provided an answer which agrees with you guys and also explains what I was ultimately trying to achieve which is actually working now. p

Negative 16927 pI have a Java socket client talking to a socket server written in another language. I am running this on Linux.p  pJava client is coded with test logic  establish client connection from java to the other language, send dummy string to server, get dummy string back  close client socket  loop.p  pAfter millions of calcs and around 7 hours, I got a read timeout on java side.p  pDont have any monitoring tools right now to see if GC came in the way or something else. p  ul liWhats the general expectation here should it run forever until server space runs out or some other external factor interferesli liHow do I make this communication reliable any best practices for faulttolerance to be coded hereli ul  hr  pstrongAdding replies here to comments belowstrongp  pThanks everyone for responding. Yes, exceptions are being catched and logged thats how i came to know about the socket read timeout error. and yes, connection was established, send also happened and then the read timeout occurred as per read timeout error.. so thats puzzling  if the server was having problems, the connection would not be successful or something else would go wrong before sendingreading data. Also, there was no error on the server  the server has a 10s write timeout, but even then there was no error  not sure why. java has 2 min read timeout  and still threw the error.p  pI had only put in error logging and not debuginfo level. no errors were there on the server application, only java client threw error and then it kept on throwing a read timeout for 1 hr. So, thats again weird  java kept on connecting and sending test string and had problems receiving the data and server never complained i can code fault tolerance to say if read timeout then wait some time and then try again  but not sure if this would completely solve my problem. sadly the server cant be rewritten to keep the socket open.p
Negative 16927 pCurrently I am working on an app that uses mutual authentication in order to communicate with a REST interface. Because I am very new to this topic I studied several examples  and now I have some questions. I hope that I am able to stick all knowledge pieces together to gain a better view of the whole process.p  pThe process should look like the followingp  ol liI got the exported server certificate which contains the servers public key and added it to the app bundle which is later used for SSL Pinning.li liThe first Request, which represents the beginning of the 2 way authentication, is a Post Request which also contains a Certificate Signing Request to get a client certificate which is required to talk with the secured part of the REST interface. The CSR is dynamically generated in code via openSSL lib.li liThe response of the server returns the signed certificate which is used for client authentication. This certificate is in DER Format and Base64 encoded. li ol  pThe code I use to perform the SSL Pinning for the first request looks like the following and the SSL Pinning works as expected.p  precode voidconnectionNSURLConnection connection willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallengeNSURLAuthenticationChallenge challenge      NSString cerPath  [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourceservercert ofTypecer]     SecTrustRef serverTrust  challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust     SecCertificateRef certificate  SecTrustGetCertificateAtIndexserverTrust, 0      NSData remoteCertificateData    CFBridgingReleaseSecCertificateCopyDatacertificate     NSData localCertificateData  [NSData dataWithContentsOfFilecerPath]       if [remoteCertificateData isEqualToDatalocalCertificateData]           NSURLCredential credential  [NSURLCredential credentialForTrustserverTrust]         [[challenge sender] useCredentialcredential forAuthenticationChallengechallenge]          [[NSURLCredentialStorage sharedCredentialStorage] setCredentialcredential forProtectionSpace[challenge protectionSpace]]          NSLogCertificate Pinning Succeeded       else           [[challenge sender] cancelAuthenticationChallengechallenge]          NSLogCertificate Pinning Failed        codepre  pBut how do I deal with the returned certificate from the server As far as I know I have to use the following NSURLConnection delegate methods  and to provide this certificate somehow to the server for further requests.p  precode BOOLconnectionNSURLConnection connection canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace   NSURLProtectionSpace protectionSpace      if[[protectionSpace authenticationMethod] isEqualToStringNSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust]           NSLogWants to Authenticate Server Trust          return YES           if[[protectionSpace authenticationMethod] isEqualToStringNSURLAuthenticationMethodClientCertificate]           NSLogWants to Authenticate Client Certificate          return YES           return NO  codepre  pAndp  precode voidconnectionNSURLConnection connection didReceiveAuthenticationChallengeNSURLAuthenticationChallenge challenge codepre  pstrongNow my question.strong I saw several examples using the PKCS12 Format which requires a private key and the certificate authority instead of a DER encoded certificate, to authenticate self against the server.

For some reason, the OnGetPlaybackPositionListener callback is not being called when the lockscreen widget is shown, instead the lockscreen widget always assumes progress is 0 then guesses the progresses from that point until the next pauseplay. So basically every time you pause it starts the progress over bc it is always getting 0.p  pI placed a log in my code and it never gets logged, making me think something is happening or Im not doing something so that my callback is not registered properly.

Negative 16927 pI have since connected to my SSH site using Putty and Filezilla.  Putty and Filezilla give me direct access to the appropriate directories and Filezilla gives me a full path from the top level directory.  I have then tried the same path from the starting point in Aptana, but get blocked one level above my target directory.  If I collapse all the directories in Putty and Filezilla and try to expand again, Putty works fine, but Filezilla then blocs at the same point as Aptana.  So there is some subtle difference in approach between Filezilla and Aptana and Putty.p  pI was looking for a way to get an encryted link when editing files on my hosted webserver when using Aptana Studio.  I can get an ordinary Remote FTP link set up and use that to edit files.  The SSH facility looked as though it could do a secure link, so got the SSH details off my ISP and set up in Studio.  In the setup I was asked to select a directory, but the ones available were all system directories rather than my htdocs tree.  However by leaving out the default provided , I could get to the htdocs tree and see all  my files under remote.  However when I try to load a file to Studio, I get a file does not exist message.  p  pIm new to SSH and Studio and dont know whether what I am trying to do is not possible or there is something else I need to set up.  So far I have  just been using Studio as a remote editor for PHP and HTML.  I suspect there is a much better and professional way to set up what I am doing under Studio even ignoring the secure transfer as I am currently doing separate backup of the files in Filezilla, but just havent figured out the way to set everything up yet.p  pMany thanks for any help.p

Negative 16927 pUp until iOS7, Apple did not support dynamic linking due to security concerns. Code reuse between developers usually relied on static libraries, which were built as part of the executable of the app.p  pIntroducing extensions in iOS8 seems to change this a bit, because extensions are separate executables. Sharing code between an extension and its containing app is done via a framework. Apple is saying this in their release notesp  blockquote   pFrameworks for iOS. iOS developers can now create strongdynamicstrong frameworks.   Frameworks are a collection of code and resources to encapsulate   functionality that is valuable across multiple projects. Frameworks   work perfectly with extensions, sharing logic that can be used by both   the main application, and the bundled extensions.p blockquote  pEmphasis is mine.p  pSource a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleaseiosdocumentationDeveloperToolsConceptualWhatsNewXcodeArticlesxcode60.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40014509SW1httpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleaseiosdocumentationDeveloperToolsConceptualWhatsNewXcodeArticlesxcode60.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40014509SW1ap  pFurther, in the extension dev guide, they explain that you can share code between an extension and the containing app via a embedded framework.p  pSource a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleaseiosdocumentationGeneralConceptualExtensibilityPGExtensionScenarios.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40014214CH21SW1httpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleaseiosdocumentationGeneralConceptualExtensibilityPGExtensionScenarios.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40014214CH21SW1ap  pMy question is  what is an embedded framework, how does it differ from a dynamic framework, and will we really see proper dynamic linking in iOS8 All the documentation Ive read seems ambiguous about this.p
Negative 16927 pstrongUpdate 1strong I included the stack traces of all threads instead of just the main threads  I thought it was enough already.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong I reopened this question, since even after applied the changes illustrated in my own question, I still get the very same error report today...p  pstrongUpdate 3strong It seems that the error happened when the thread is terminating and the thread message thats being sent when the error happened was codeCOmniTaskMsgTerminatedcode. Now its very strange  Ive replaced almost all calls to codeTask.Comm.Sendcode in my program with a threadsafe queue, so Im quite sure the number of thread messages go through codeTask.Commcode is a very small, far less than that might fill up the Windows message queue...p  hr  pI use OmniThreadLibrary3.03a just upgraded to the latest svn, Ill see... with Delphi XE4, and get an error reported from the end user, the error message and stack trace of the thread that had this problem are included at the end.p  pActually Ive reduced the possibility of this error, by replacing the calls to codeTask.Comm.Sendcode with a threadsafe queue which is used by the background threads to send logs to the main thread. Now I dont know where to look at, the most possible place is here but within this code block no codeTask.Comm.Sendcode calls...p  precode  at this point, we are already in a thread other than the main thread.

While I want to send an error object in a SOAP Fault instead. How can I do thatp  pThanks in advance.p  h2Updateh2  pDefault exception strategy sends SOAP Fault with error message. Initially my purpose was to just add the logger and let the default error message go in the SOAP Fault. I added Catch exception strategy but later found out it does not send SOAP fault. Instead then I used Rollback strategy that send SOAP fault. However, there was not much benefit of logging exception inside strategy block using Mule Logger as it is already logged by Mule. p  pNow, I realize the advantage of using cxfoutFaultInterceptor. You can not only add custom elements to SOAP Fault but you can also segregate custom logs in separate log file. Thanks Anirban for providing sample interceptor class.p

Negative 16927 pWe have an authentication system which uses Google App Engine as the backend. The underlying languages and frameworks consist of Java, JDO, Google Authentication amp Google App Engine.p  pWe have a User Entity. A User Entity is User Metadata saved from the Google App Engine authentication response for example first name, last name, email address.p  pWhen a user tries to register or login both a signin event, we scan the datastore to see if a user with the same email address already exists. If the user does not already exist, we create a new user. If the user does exist, we update and retrieve their user information and then retrieve their application data.p  pWe need to run separate, multiple transactions, because the Login page is completely separate of the application page.p  pIn some cases, when a user tries to register twice in a short period of time, a duplicate user is created. While we could always fetch the last user registered, we really want the query to be a unique JDO query. Using a unique JDO query, the JDO query run inside a transaction sometimes fails due to two identical values being found for the users email address.p  pWe considered the following ways to enforce the constraint p  ol listoring a freshly registered users information in cache. We didnt seem to find any information that would suggest cache would be a suitable solution to prevent duplicates. Is cache instantly available across machines Even if it is, the cache could eject an entity for various reasons.li listoring the users email in a session. This seemed to bloat the code and seemed a bizarre way to enforce constraints.li ol  pIs there a bestpractices approach with Google App Engine to prevent duplicate values during an authentication workflow, and separate transactionsp

Negative 16927 pI am using AFNetworking to send and receive responses from a controller on my network. The controller is receiving the response and sending back its response but my code is printing out null for its response object.

Negative 16927 pIm working to create a view that uses a full outer join and then a left outer join to join to it.  The view produces the results I want, but were using EF6 Database first to pull in the DB object into a .net MVC application.  With that we have to have at least one column in the view be nonnull unique to allow ef to create the inferred primary key.  I tried adding it afterwards but couldnt get around it because the view in SQL with the full outer join has to allow nulls.p  pI also tried union and union all but that creates duplicates.  I want the nonnull unique values.p  pFor example.  Lets say TableA, TableB, and TableC all have the same primary key.  All tables have different columns which is why union all produces duplicates.  I want the merged results where merged.p  precodeSelect   c.guid  ,a.something  ,b.something  ,c.something  ,etc FROM TableA as a Full Outer Join TableB as b on a.guid  b.guid LEFT OUTER JOIN       TableC as c on c.guid  a.guid OR c.guid  b.guid codepre  pIve also tried a right outer join with TableC first but that gives the same results.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 16927 pI cant for the life of me stream a mp4 to Chrome with a html5 codeltvideogtcode tag.  If I drop the file in codepubliccode then everything is gravy and works as expected.  But if I try to serve it using codesendfilecode, pretty much everything imaginable goes wrong.  I am using a rails app that is proxied by nginx, with a codeVideocode model that has a codelocationcode attribute that is an absolute path on disk.p  pAt first I triedp  precodedef show   sendfile Video.findparams[id].location end codepre  pAnd I was sure I would be basking in the glory that is modern web development.  Ha.  This plays in both Chrome and Firefox, but neither seek and neither have any idea how long the video is.  I poked at the response headers and realized that codeContentTypecode is being sent as codeapplicationoctetstreamcode and there is no codeContentLengthcode set.  Umm... wthp  pOkay, I guess I can set those in railsp  precodedef show   video  Video.findparams[id]   response.headers[ContentLength]  File.statvideo.location.size   sendfilevideo.location, type videomp4 end codepre  pAt this point everything works pretty much as expected in Firefox.  It knows how long the video is and seeking works as expected.  Chrome appears to know how long the video is doesnt show timestamps, but seek bar looks appropriate but seeking doesnt work.p  pApparently Chrome is pickier than Firefox.  It requires that the server respond with a codeAcceptRangescode header with value codebytescode and respond to subsequent requests that happen when the users seeks with code206code and the appropriate portion of the file.p  pOkay, so I borrowed some code from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma76043304283486herea and then I had thisp  precodevideo  Video.findparams[id]  filebegin  0 filesize  File.statvideo.location.size fileend  filesize  1  if request.headers[Range]   statuscode  ok else   statuscode  partialcontent   match  request.headers[Range].matchbytesdd   if match     filebegin  match[1]     fileend  match[2] if match[2] ampamp match[2].empty   end   response.header[ContentRange]  bytes   filebegin.tos    fileend.tos    filesize.tos end response.header[ContentLength]  fileend.toi  filebegin.toi  1.tos response.header[AcceptRanges]  bytes response.header[ContentTransferEncoding]  binary sendfilevideo.location, filename gt File.basenamevideo.location, type gt videomp4, disposition gt inline, status gt statuscode, stream gt  true, buffersize  gt  4096 codepre  pNow Chrome attempts to seek, but when you do the video stops playing and never works again until the page reloads.  Argh.  So I decided to play around with curl to see what was happening and I discovered thisp  blockquote   p curl header Range bytes200400 a hrefhttplocalhost8080videos1001.mp4httplocalhost8080videos1001.mp4a    ftypisomisomiso2avc1mp41       moovlmvhdtraktkhp      p curl header Range bytes12001400 a hrefhttplocalhost8080videos1001.mp4httplocalhost8080videos1001.mp4a    ftypisomisomiso2avc1mp41       moovlmvhdtraktkhp blockquote  pNo matter the byte range request, the data always starts from the beginning of the file.

And why doesnt nginx set codeContentTypecode automagically here like it does for the simple nodejs example  I have codeconfig.actiondispatch.xsendfileheader  XAccelRedirectcode set. I have moved it back and forth between codeapplication.rbcode and codedevelopment.rbcode with the same results.  I guess I never mentioned... this is rails 4.2.0.p  hr  blockquote   pUpdate 3p blockquote  pNow Ive changed my unicorn server to listen on port 3000 since I already changed nginx to listen on 3000 for the nodejs example.  Now I can make requests directly to unicorn since its listening on a port and not a socket so I have found that codecurl Icode directly to unicorn shows that no codeXAccelRedirectcode header is sent and just codecurlcodeing unicorn directly actually sends the file.  Its like codesendfilecode isnt doing what its supposed to.p

Negative 16927 pWhilst JavaScript might not be multithreaded, it does support asynchronous execution and whilst executions for 2 or more asynchronous bits of code might be on the same thread, the fact that an asynchronous order of events cannot be predicted, makes it possible for a race condition between asynchronous executions to occur.p  pI am doing an strongasynchronousstrong check for the existence of an object property.

For this I load the properties and tenants from the REST service in the controller, then I use the following method in the view within an ngrepeat row to display the tenants lease expiryp  precodeparent.leaseInfoproperty.expires codepre  pThe implementation of leaseInfo looks like thisp  precode    scope.leaseInfo  functionproperty      if property ampamp scope.tenants          for var i  0 i lt property.tenantIds.length i              var tenant  scope.lookupTenantproperty.tenantIds[i]               TODO does tenant have active lease  for now just pick the first one             if tenant.leaseStart ampamp tenant.leaseStart.length gt 0                  var label  info                 var expires                   var leasePeriod  tenant.monthToMonth  Monthtomonth  tenant.leasePeriod  month                 var leaseStart  momenttenant.leaseStart                 var leaseEnd  leaseStart.addtenant.leasePeriod, M                 var leaseDaysLeft  leaseEnd.diffmoment, days                   expired is danger, lt 31 is warning, otherwise okay                 if leaseDaysLeft lt 0                      label  danger                     expires  expired   leaseEnd.fromNow                  else if leaseDaysLeft lt 31                      label   warning                     expires  expires   leaseEnd.fromNow                  else                      label  success                     expires  expires   leaseEnd.fromNow                                   return  label label , leasePeriod leasePeriod,  expires expires                                  return  label danger, leasePeriod Vacant, expires no lease   codepre  pI think this is a somewhat egregious example of how Im misusing angluar bindings and controllers.  I even call this multiple times on the same tenant row to display the different components of the object that is returned.  However I chose my worst example to get my point across about what Im struggling with.p  pOne option would be to assemble the entire JSON structure in node, and have the tenant and calculated values already expanded and calculated in the REST service response.  However to me this feels like Id be breaking some REST service principles in returning a deeply nested structure that is a mixture of multiple entities.p  pI guess I could also do this on the client in the angular controller and assemble this object structure once the collections are loaded.  This feels a little better to me as I would not have the strange parent binding and inefficient lookup and calculation perbinding.p  pI appreciate any advice on how to bind and display related data such as this, and from within child scopes such as the ngrepeat row.p
Negative 16927 pI would like to have a web and an endpoint module.p  pI have this working in my dev environment largely following a hrefhttpsgithub.comGoogleCloudPlatformappenginemodulessamplejava relnofollowhttpsgithub.comGoogleCloudPlatformappenginemodulessamplejavaa .p  pHowever I cant get this working when hosted inside app engine. If I make the web module the default, I cant route to the endpoint module via dispatch.xml. This is because endpoints apparently need to live at ahapi and its not possible to route this away from the default module.p  pThe other alternative is putting the endpoint module as the default module, however I dont then know how to route everything but ahapi to the web module. It seems that you cant route  away from the default module.p  pEDIT Note I want to have both modules running off of the same custom domain.p  pEDIT2 Note this is single page app. The front end module is purely html, css and js, which I want to talk to the endpoint module on the same domain.p  pAny way to solve thisp
Negative 16927 pI am using Hibernate behind JPA. I am using EntityGraph to fetch the required data.p  pI have classes A, B and Cp  precodeclass A    Integer attrib1   String attrib2   ListltBgt blist  typical size about 250 objects   ListltCgt clist  typical size about 100 objects  codepre  pClasses B and C have their own subgraphs that I am fetching along with the main graph.p  pThe problem is occurring with the main graph.p  pIt is generating 3 SQL queries in all to fetch all the required data. The problem is with the first query. p  pIn an attempt to reduce the number of queries thats what I think, in the first query, Hibernate does a join on A, B and C.p  pi.e p  pA  left outer join B on A.xB.x left outer join C on A.yC.yp  pThis creates highly suboptimal result set with several tens of thousands of rows with a lot a duplicated data across rows.p  pI can see that the same query can turn out to be very effective by avoiding separate queries for each collection if the number of relations between A and B amp A and C is small. However, in this case, since the number of relations is large, it fails miserably.p  pHow do I make hibernate not do thisp  pI would like Hibernate to generate a separate SQL query for each Collection. This way the cost would go up linearly with collection size. p

Negative 16927 pwe are developing an app for outlook using Apps for Office JavaScript API. We need to be able to store properties for each appointment per user, but the appointments may or may not reside in the loggedin users calendar. they may instead be in a shared calendar that the user has been granted readwrite access.p  pHowever, when using the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryofficefp142138.aspx relnofollowloadCustomPropertiesAsynca method of the opened item, it fails if the appointment is from a shared calendar.p  pWe attempted to work around this by using the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comENUSlibraryfp161171.aspx relnofollowroamingSettingsa object, but it appears these properties are not per message like custom Properties are but rather GLOBAL to the application, so no matter what message they open it will always have the same properties.p  pIs there any workaround to this users want to be able to utilize the compose app but need to be able to use it with shared calendars.p

Negative 16927 pI have got two activities. In first you can input jobname and job place into inputtext views. First activity contains also navigationdraver menu appearing from left side of screen. After clicking Searc button, results are shown in listview in second activity. You can longclick on any listview item and then it will be added to navigationdrawer in first activity. You can go back to first activity by clicking back arrow. The problem is, that when I will go back to first activity, press Search button again and then go back to first activity again, the navigation drawer menu is empty again all items, which were added on first try are deleted. How to fix thatp  pHere is pic with my activities sorry for poor qualityp  p1 first activity 2 navigation drawer in first activity with added items from second activity listview 3 second activity listview with search results img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfqgCj.png altenter image description herep  pEDIT My code from two activities without imports to shorten it a little First mainp  precodepublic class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity       ListviewActivity lv  new ListviewActivity      private ListView mDrawerList     private DrawerLayout mDrawerLayout     public ArrayAdapterltStringgt mAdapter     private ActionBarDrawerToggle mDrawerToggle     private String mActivityTitle      ArrayListltStringgt arrayFav  new ArrayListltStringgt     ArrayListltStringgt arrayLin  new ArrayListltStringgt      private ImageView mImageViewLogo     private Button mButtonSzukaj     private EditText mEditTextPraca     private EditText mEditTextMiejsce     public static String nazwaStanowiska     public static String nazwaMiejscowosci     private Settings mSettings      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.startlayout           mDrawerList  ListViewfindViewByIdR.id.navListmDrawerLayout  DrawerLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.drawerlayout         mActivityTitle  getTitle.toString          addDrawerItems         setupDrawer          getSupportActionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue         getSupportActionBar.setHomeButtonEnabledtrue          mImageViewLogo  ImageViewfindViewByIdR.id.imageViewLogo         mButtonSzukaj  Button findViewByIdR.id.buttonSzukaj         mEditTextPraca  EditTextfindViewByIdR.id.editTextPraca         mEditTextMiejsce  EditTextfindViewByIdR.id.editTextMiejsce          final String mPrBefore  mEditTextPraca.getText.toString         final String mPrAfter  mPrBefore.trim          final String mMiBefore  mEditTextMiejsce.getText.toString         final String mMiAfter  mMiBefore.trim          mEditTextPraca.setTextmPrAfter         mEditTextMiejsce.setTextmMiAfter          mSettings  new Settingsthis          mAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged         ifmAdapter.isEmpty             arrayFav.addBrak ofert             mDrawerList.setOnItemClickListenernull             mDrawerList.setOnItemLongClickListenernull                  mAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged          mButtonSzukaj.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener               Override             public void onClickView v                   if TextUtils.isEmptymEditTextPraca.getText.toString ampamp TextUtils.isEmptymEditTextMiejsce.getText.toString                      mEditTextPraca.setErrorPole obowizkowe                     mEditTextMiejsce.setErrorPole obowizkowe                     return                  else if TextUtils.isEmptymEditTextPraca.getText.toString                      mEditTextPraca.setErrorPole obowizkowe                     return                  else if TextUtils.isEmptymEditTextMiejsce.getText.toString                      mEditTextMiejsce.setErrorPole obowizkowe                     return                  else                      nazwaStanowiska  mEditTextPraca.getText.toString                     nazwaMiejscowosci  mEditTextMiejsce.getText.toString                     Intent myIntent  new IntentMainActivity.this, ListviewActivity.class                     MainActivity.this.startActivityForResultmyIntent, 1                      mSettings.setmText1mEditTextPraca.getText.toString                     mSettings.setmText2mEditTextMiejsce.getText.toString                     mSettings.save                                                readPreferences           protected void readPreferences         mEditTextPraca.setTextmSettings.getmText1         mEditTextMiejsce.setTextmSettings.getmText2           protected void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data          super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, data          if requestCode  1              ifresultCode  RESULTOK                 ArrayListltStringgt passedText  data.getStringArrayListExtratext                 ArrayListltStringgt passedLink  data.getStringArrayListExtralink                 arrayFav.clear                 arrayLin.clear                 arrayFav.addAllpassedText                 arrayLin.addAllpassedLink                 addDrawerItems                                 Override     public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu           Inflate the menu this adds items to the action bar if it is present.         getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.menumain, menu         return true           Override     public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item           Handle action bar item clicks here.

Negative 16927 pim new to Pygame, and still learning Python. Im using Python 3.4.  I followed this amazing game creation tutorial a hrefhttppythonprogramming.netpygamepython3part1intro relnofollowhttppythonprogramming.netpygamepython3part1introa after completing the lessons I decided to change the game slightly, and have succeeded in added some more movement and fixed some bugs. however now im trying to figure out how to change the sprite when I press an arrow key, as to make it appeal like it tilting.   I have a file call racecar.png which is the plane and moveright which looks like it is tilted. My end goal is to have it when I press the right arrow, the moveright.png is displayed until I release the key, in which case it returns to racecar.png. I have looked up how to use sprite sheets, which failed, how to animate, watched youtube, googled my problem but I cant find anyone else who has this problem. most of what I found talked about moving the sprite around the screen. here is the codep  precodeimport pygame import random import time  pygame.init  carwidth  100 carheight  100  displaywidth  800 displayheight  600  gameDisplay

Negative 16927 pThrough my Android application I want to connect cloud such as Dropbox, Google Drive etc. However, I want to make my application location sensitive. That is if I am in US my app will send data to Dropbox US server, if I am in Germany data would be redirected to server in Germany. In their API guide I couldnt find anything like that. How to specify location specific server through Android App before the cloud provider handle this on its own Moreover, I am skeptical about data consistency among different servers. If I want to upload same file with different edit from different location does the providers maintains different version location wide  I am very new in this area. Can somebody share hisher idea, experience on this  p

I click on sync, and quickly on changes to list my copious changes for the day.. 50 files or so. GitHub, pops up something about a conflict on a binary file that I never touched, and shouldnt be in conflict as no one else is editing the project It gives me some option like you cant commit your changes until you fix and commit this conflict. I cant remember the second option, but I click commit. It commits the conflicted binary file.. but then.... all my list of changes disappears from the changes window, and after loading up the project all the work for the day has gone...    it is back to looking like it did at the start of the day. there is no record of a commit or any changes in github, except for the conflicted single binary file, and the commit from previous day at work.p  pWhat happened  why were there no warnings  Surely this cannot be how Git is supposed to behave when there is a conflict  Help please. is my work still somewhere p
