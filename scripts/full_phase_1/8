Positive 8 pGiven string of digits like 72388 and int n, delete n characters from the sting such the resulting string contains minimal number representation, you must preserve relative position of digits. Example if st72388 and n2, the answer is 238.  p  pBelow solution does not seem to work for all the cases. How can we reduce a string to minimal string p  pSolution  Idea here is scan from left to right delete a char if it is greater than next char in string array and prev char. if the number of chars deleted are less than n by the end of the iteration, repeat the same iteration from end to start of the string.p  precodechar  minstringchar str, int n  static char buf[100]   int len  strlenstr int k  1 int count  0 int i char prev, curr, next  iflen  0  len lt n return 1  iflen  n return 0  prev  str[0] fori1 iltlen1 ampamp countltn i  curr  str[i] next  str[i1] ifcurr gt next ampamp curr gt prev      count     continue  else ifcurr lt next ampamp curr lt prev      count     prev  curr     buf[k]  curr  else      buf[k]  curr    ifcount lt n  count  0 k  len  n prev  buf[k  1]  str[len1] forilen2 igt0 i      curr  str[i]     next  str[i1]     ifcurr gt next ampamp curr gt prev          count     continue          else ifcurr lt next ampamp curr lt prev          count     prev  curr     buf[k]  curr          else          buf[k]  curr        printfResulted string        sn, buf return buf  else  for iltlen i      buf[k]  str[i]   printfResulted string ascending      sn, buf return buf   codepre
Positive 8 pI have a script that contains a struct and I need to make several computations to the fields. Right now all of my computations are within my main function and everything is getting ugly and out of control. Id like to know how I can create a function to be able to pass my struct to, to do calculations. The main also contains an integer value reccount that holds the number of elements in my struct. Id also like to pass that value to the new function.

Positive 8 pI am writting an application in C that will be ran in a terminal, and it would be handy but not necesary to use some of the less used unicode characters. From my experimentation, I have not had any trouble rendering them. However, I would not use any non ascii characters if it were a likely source of trouble in the future.p  pSo, in short, can I count on just about any terminal or terminal emulator in the modern nix world mainly linux, freebsd, and osx to properly render arbitrary utf8 charactersp  pIf I cannot make such an assumption, there are particular subsets of unicode characters defined for various purposes, so would some such subset at least be reliably rendered in any likely modern nix terminal or terminal emulatorp  pNOTE When I say arbitrary, I do mean arbitrary any unicode characters.

Positive 8 pI am planning to write a Java FFI library that will use a hrefhttpluajit.orgdynasm.html relnofollowDynASMa to generate the FFI trampolines at runtime, instead of performing interpreted calls via libffi.p    pAt least initially, I do not plan on supporting passingreturning composite types by value.

Also, DynASM does not support dynamic register allocation.p

I would like to be able to continue increasing it the amount of values it can contain indefinitely.p  pThis is the test code I have been using to try and figure this outp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainvoid          int i         int Up         int Ary[0]          printfPlease enter the number of integers you want to input          scanfd, ampUp         fori  0 i lt Up i                          printfPlease enter a number                  Ary[i]  int mallocsizeofint                 scanfd, ampAry[i]                  fori  0 i lt Up i                          printfd , Ary[i]                 ifi  10  0                                          printfn                                   return 0  codepre  pThis may be a poor way of attempting to figure this out and I may also be doing this is a completely wrong way However I get a segmentation fault sometimes. If I use small values such as only entering 4 or 5 values it works fine, however if I enter 10 values it gives me a segmentation fault. If I enter 50 values, it lets me enter all 50 but gives me a segmentation fault after printing out the 41st value. p  pThe code itself is simply a means to an end. Ultimately what I would like to know is how I can set up an array of anything that can have values added to it indefinitely while retaining previous values using dynamic memory allocation p  pemPS. I hope this defines my question well enough, however if it does not I would like to refine my question so it is more clear. Please make a comment if this is unclear and why.emp
Positive 8 pI am having an issue with getting a user string passed in as a variable parsed so that each word is in its own variable.

Negative 8 pI have been asked to develop some usercontrols in ASP.NET that will at a later point be pulled into a SharePoint site as web parts. I am new to SharePoint and will not have access to a SharePoint server during the time I need to prototype these parts.p  pDoes anyone know of any reasons that this approach will not work  If this approach is not recommended, what would other options be Any suggestions on a resourcetutorial on what to consider when developing an ASP.NET web part with SharePoint in mindp  pThanksp  pstrongEdit 12312008strong I finally marked an answer to this one. It took me a while to realize that going the SharePoint route right away, though painful at first, is the best way to go about it. The free VPC image makes getting set up to develop relatively painless. p  pWhile you can, as I did, develop web parts in ASP.NET without SharePoint, when it comes to developing and deploying SharePoint applications you havent learned a thing, only pushed the learning curve off into a time when you think you are done, and have probably informed stakeholders to that effect. To delay the SharePoint learning curve doesnt do you or your project any favors, and your final product will better for the expertise you gain along the way.p

Negative 8 pIm walking through Adam Kinneys Blend tutorials a hrefhttpvisitmix.comlabsrosettaEyesOfBlend relnofollowhttpvisitmix.comlabsrosettaEyesOfBlenda and Im seeing some puzzling behavior with resizing objects.

Before I group the 3 circles into a grid, if I select all 3 they all resize the way I would intend with each circle growing and shrinking to the appropriate size to maintain the original proportion and position. Now, if I group the circles into a grid and then try to resize, resizing still occurs but the proportion of the 2 inner circles does not hold.

Negative 8 pIve got an object that is being serialized  deserialized via the XmlSerializer in C, .NET 3.5. One of the properties and more in the future is a collection List where T is an enum value. This serializes  deserializes fine.p  pWe are also using a default values mechanism to provide default values for the object, in case the serialized version doesnt have any value set. as a simple example, here is what we are dongp  precodepublic enum MyEnum    Value1,   Value2   public class Foo     public List SomeSetting get set     public Foo        SomeSetting  new List     SomeSetting.AddMyEnum.Value1     SomeSetting.AddMyEnum.Value2     codepre  pThis code works fine for setting the default values of SomeSetting when the object is constructed. p  pHowever, when we are deserializing an xml file that has values for SomeSetting, this default value setup is causing problems the xml deserializer does not reset the SomeSetting collection  it does not wipe it clean and populate with new data. Rather, it adds on to the data that is already there. So, if the xml file has Value1 serialized into it, when I deserialize that file, i end up with SomeSettings having Value1, Value2, Value1 as the values being stored.p  pI need a way for the xml deserialization process to allow my default values to exist when there is no data for SomeSetting in the xml document, and also to wholesale replace the SomeSetting values when there is data in the xml document. How can I do thisp  pFYI  this is not the only property in the document. The document does exist, and is being serialized  deserialized for the other simple values. This is the property that is causing problems, though. I have to support this scenario because I need to do this a lot, now.p

Negative 8 pImagine the following situation I have two branches DEV and MAIN. Im working on a file in the DEV branch called program.cs. I checked it in multiple times, so I end up having a couple of changesets for example 5900, 5905, 5909. Please note these are not contiguous.p  pNow I want to merge these changes to MAIN, but without checking in each changeset in between. This isnt possible because the first merge works, but the second merge of the changeset gives me the following error p  precodeTF14085 Cannot merge DEVprogram.cs to MAINprogram.cs because there is an incompatible pending change not edit or encoding at MAINprogram.cs already. codepre  pIs there any way to get around this error Is Visual Studio 2010 behaving the same I will probably have the chance to try this out later today How does TFS do this when merging multiple, but contiguous changesetsp

Negative 8 pWondering if anybody else has found some very odd behaviour with the XAMLWPF 4 editor in VS2010, and can explain what is going wrong. This only occurs if the project is using .NET 4.p  pWhenever I tried to open a XAML document for editing, the window would appear to open for a split second and then vanish, but VS2010 would still list the window as open.p  pThe fault was eventually traced to having the Reuse current document window, if saved option under Documents in the Environment options checked. Once this was unchecked XAML 4 files opened as expected.p  pAs I said, this only appears to occur on projects targeted at .NET Framework 4  those targeted at 3.5 worked without a problem, and the Reuse current document window, if saved appears to work fine on other files.p

Negative 8 pI have read quite a few posts on SO and around the web of the benefits and features of various WPF Frameworks Caliburn, Prism and Module Frameworks MEF, Unity and combining them.  p  pIn theory, I love the ideas behind them.  And I know once I get a grasp on those systems, that it may actually increase development speed  but the upfront cost of learning tools and frameworks with that level of complexity seems high. p  pstrongProject Backgroundstrongbr I am taking a 10year old series of Access databases with an enormous amount of bad macro code and redesigning the database.  On top of that, I want to come up with the best way to display and present that information.  Using Access 2007 is an option, but not one I would like to use.p  pThe company I am working for is a small to medium size business and the app will have about 4080 concurrent users during the work day.

If I go for a standard approach, the code would be littered with ifelse statements. However, if I go with a large framework  I feel it is overkill for what is basically a database access layer  especially given the high upfront learning curve.

Negative 8 pSorry for the somewhat confusing title.  Not sure really how to title this.  My situation is this I have an academic simulation tool, that I in the process of developing a web frontend for.  While the Cbased simulator is computationally quite efficient several hundredths to a tenth of a second runtime for small systems, it can generate a significant in web app terms amount of data 46mb.p  pCurrently the setup is as followsp  ol liUser accesses index.html file.  This page on the left side has an interactive form where the user can input simulation parameters.  On the right side is a representation of the system they are creating, along with some greyed out tabs for various plots of the simulation data.li liUser clicks Run simulation.  This submits the requested sim parameters to a runSimulation.php file via an AJAX call.  runSimulation.php creates an input file based on the submitted data, then runs the simulator using this input file.  The simulator spits out 46mb of data in various output files.li liOnce the simulation is done running, the response to the browser is another javascript function which calls a file returnData.php.  This php script packages the data in the output files as JSON data, returns the JSON data to the browser, then deletes the data files.li liThis response data is then fed to a few plotting objects in the browsers javascript, and the plot tabs become active.  The user can then open and interact with the plotted data.li ol  pThis setup is working OK, however I am running into two issuesp  ul liThe return data is slow 46mb of data coming back can take a while to load.  That data is being gzipped, which reduces its side considerably, but it still can take 20 seconds on a slower connectionli liThe next goal is to allow the user to plot multiple simulation runs so that they can compare the results.li ul  pMy thought is that I might want to keep the data files on the server, while the users session is active.  This would enable the ability to only load up the data for the plot the user wants to view and perhaps loading other data in the background as they view the results of the current plot.  For the multiple runs, I can have multiple data sets sitting on the server, ready for the user to download ifwhen they are needed.p  pHowever, I have a big issue with this line of thinking how do I recognize in php that the user has left the server, and delete the data  I dont want the users to take over the drive space on the machine.  Any thoughts on best practices for this kind of web appp

Negative 8 pthis is my first question, so please be gentle p  pIm stuck with a weird problem. Essentially i get three XSD definitions like the followingp  precodePartA.xsd targetNameSpacePartA includePartB.xsd  PartB.xsd lt no namespace definition gt  PartC.xsd targetNameSpacePartC inludePartB.xsd importPartA.xsd codepre  pThe error pops up, when binding emPartCem via JAXB to Java classesp  ul liA classinterface with the same name b.exampleType is already in use. Use a class customization to resolve this conflict.li liThis confusing error happened most likely because the schema uses a technique called chameleon schema, which causes a single definition to be loaded multiple times into different namespaces. See a hrefhttpforums.java.netjivethread.jspathreadID18631httpforums.java.netjivethread.jspathreadID18631a for more about this.li ul  pFollowing the link, i found out, the actual error lies in PartB, which has no namespace declaration This method is called strongemChameleon Schemaemstrong. The defined types in emPartBem will adopt the namesspace of the emimporting XSDem.p  pSo in my case, there are two namespaces for the same typep  ol liPartAli liPartCli ol  pAnd this is, where JAXB breaks down. I havent found a way to bind emPartCem properly. And to make things tricky i have chance to change the original XSD definitionsp  pHas anyone come across this phenomena or something like that before and has a valid workaround for it p

Negative 8 pOk, so I am hoping someone can shed some light on this. The thing is I have an app where the user can interact with a number of pads that are kind of like big icons, that can be dragged around on the screen. Tapping once on the pad opens it and tapping and holding brings up an alert view which asks if you want to delete it. I am using a timer to check that a user is tapping and holding and invalidating the timer in the touchesMoved and touchesEnded events. The thing is that if you tap very quickly on a pad the touchesEnded event is never fired and as such the delete dialog appears, which can get a little confusing for a user.

Negative 8 pI am working on a web application that is deployed to Websphere as a war file contained inside a wrapper ear. There are no other modules within the ear. A shared library has been created at the cell scope in the Websphere admin console, and I can specify a shared library reference at the web module level in the admin console. Everything works great when I do this, until I undeploy and redeploy the application, which of course causes the shared library reference to disappear.p  pI would like to specify the shared library reference in the deployment descriptors for the war or ear, but Im not sure how to do this at the web module level. Does anyone know if a shared library reference can be specified at the web module level via deployment descriptors in the war or ear filep  pEDIT this screenshot shows the shared library reference that was created in the admin console. My goal is to have the same shared library reference created via deployment descriptors, so that each time the app is undeployed and redeployed the shared library reference does not need to be recreated in the admin console.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcdmKA.pngp

Negative 8 pI know that a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat, runs in a single instance of the JVM, which means all of its servlets will run in the same process.p  pI also know that the architecture of the servlet container means each web application exists in its own context, which suggests it is isolated from other web applications. p  pAs depicted here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8BGnQ.jpg altalt textp  pAccepting that each web application is isolated, I would expect that you could create 2 copies of an identical web application, change the names and context paths of each as well as any other relevant configuration, and run them in parallel without one affecting the other.

Negative 8 pI have a website that uses a View with exposed filters and the Finder module to search for jobs.  One of the criteria is salary range, which is displayed in British Pounds in a select box with 4 options.  However, the client has asked for an option that allows the user to display a different currency.p  pI have created a module that allows a user the select a different currency, which in turn sets a session variable containing a currency value.  When the user views a page containing either the Finder search form or the Views exposed filter, Drupal adds some JQuery which changes the visible values of the select box based on the value of the session variable.  However, it does not change the actual values of the select options  only what the user can see.  p  pUnfortunately this method throws the illegal choice has been detected please contact the site administrator error, obviously because the posted form array doesnt match the form array stored by Drupal.  So the question is, how can I stop this error from occurring  I was thinking of the form values being reset by JQuery just before submit, although Im not sure how I would change the values between the user clicking the submit button and the form actually being submitted.  Another choice is perhaps hookformalter to change the form values, but Im not exactly sure if this would work either.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 8 pSo I need to test some view models that have a private field containing an adapter, this adapter gets manipulated via ICommands  input  etc from the views, I think this is a pretty common model, the view exposes some public properties that are specific to what that particular view is all about and then then the adapter is concelled in a private field. Now my problem is testing. I am using Unity to register an instance of that adapter and then each view model gets that same instance of course but I cant test it cause it is private so I created an accessor class but I cant figure out how to create and instance of it.

Negative 8 pI noticed that some of my gzip decoding code seemed to be failing to detect corrupted data.  I think that I have traced the problem to the Java GZipInputStream class.  In particular, it seems that when you read the entire stream with a single read call, corrupted data doesnt trigger an IOException.  If you read the stream in 2 or more calls on the same corrupted data, then it does trigger an exception.p  pI wanted to see what the community here thought before I consider filing a bug report.p  pEDIT I have modified my example because the last one did not as clearly illustrate what I perceive to be the issue.  In this new example, a 10 byte buffer is gzipped, one byte of the gzipped buffer is modified, then it is ungzipped.  The call to GZipInputStream.read returns 10 as the number of bytes read, which is what you would expect for a 10 byte buffer.  Nevertheless, the unzipped buffer is different than the original due to the corruption.  No exception is thrown.  I did note that calling available after the read returns 1 instead of 0 which it would if the EOF had been reached.  p  pHere is the sourcep  precode  Test public void gzip      try        int length  10       byte[] bytes  new byte[]12, 19, 111, 14, 76, 34, 60, 43, 91, 101       System.out.printlnArrays.toStringbytes        Gzip the byte array       ByteArrayOutputStream baos  new ByteArrayOutputStream       GZIPOutputStream gos  new GZIPOutputStreambaos       gos.writebytes       gos.finish       byte[] zipped  baos.toByteArray        Alter one byte of the gzipped array.

Negative 8 pI am not exactly sure the best practice of doing this, so I thought Id ask.p  pHeres the programs objectivep  ul liA custom navigation controller created via a root UIViewController that does not actually subclass UINavigationControllerTo easily manipulate the designli liNested view controllers for different screens manipulated by the main view controllerli liEach nested view controller has its own nib fileli ul  pCurrently, I have it working, however each nested view controller is not a view controller but a subclassed UIView. I feel like this is bad practice because I am using these UIViews in a view controller way but without the functions of a view controller ie. viewDidLoad. Also, these UIViews are taking on the usual delegate methods of a UIViewController which really sets off red flags.p  pIs this actually bad practicep  pThings I am afraid of when trying to switch to UIViewControllers are that I would still have to make a subclass of UIView to identify which view to point to when I load the nib viap  precodeNSArray bundle  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamednibName ownerself optionsnil]  for id object in bundle      if [object isKindOfClass[SubclassedUIView class]]         currentScreenViewController  SubclassedUIView object  codepre  pI havent checked yet, but I assume I have to do SubclassedUIView rather than just UIView in that statement because there are other UIView objects in the bundle. But then again, that situation may be better off than the current one.p  pA different solution may be to make MainViewController a delegate for all of the UIViews that require a delegate and create categories of the MainViewController containing the delegate methods for each nested nib.p  pAny idea herep

Negative 8 pIve build an asp.net site with a report viewer control that displays reports hosted on our reporting services report server. Everything works great. But now I need to do the same thing with a public facing site, where Ill need to access my report server through the firewall. p  pMy question is How do I lock this down to make sure that the end user can only access certain reports p  pI think that all I need to do is make sure my IIS, in my DMZ, can talk to the report server. But, I think Ill need to impersonate a user that only has access to the reports I want to make available. On the other hand, if my report server is only accessible from the DMZ, then I wont need to worry about the end user directly connecting to the report server. I seems like any report I want to serve to the outside world just needs to be accessible by the default ASPNET account I hoping someone can confirm my speculation or tell me where Im wrong.p

Negative 8 pI have a c application with several image typesRGB, Gray... and every type has properties like Rotation or Scale. Every image type is generated via some computation from the other types. For example, A rotated codeGrayImagecode is generated by rotating a codeGrayImagecode which in turn is generated by graying an codeRGBImagecode.p  pI would like to design a cache class with methods codeGetX...code that caches the various images and possibly all images in the computation path. This class would also know how to generate each image in case it is not in the cache.p  pThe class must fulfill some constraintsp  ol lipSince we are dealing with images of different types and representationsRGB, GrayScale etc. the cache must return a concrete class for the calling code to be able to use it without some sort of casting. Thus, the cache mechanism must hold different cache structures containing concrete types. fix me if Im wrong herep  precodemaplt...,RGBImagegt  maplt...,GrayImagegt  codepre  pfor example. pli lipThe cache must be flexible to changes in computation of images. Changes to code are acceptable as long as they are not too large.pli ol  pThe current version I have attaches a codeKeycode struct to each image type. Theres codeGrayKeycode, codeRGBKeycode and so on. the various keys hold properties like Scale and Rotation and can have properties specific to the image e.g. toGrayConvertingMethod for codeGrayKeycode. The cache holds maps of the form p  precode    map ltXKey,XImagegt codepre  pcodeGetX...code method receives a codeKeycode struct as parameter requesting a Rotated GrayImage for example. Though, this implementation forces the cache to apply lots of logic for computations of images. It must check whether GrayKey requests a rotated image or not and act accordingly. I would like to encode this image computation relationship in a more elegant way but cant seem to find one.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 8 pI am writing a compiler more for fun than anything else, but I want to try to make it as efficient as possible.  For example I was told that on Intel architecture the use of any  register other than codeEAXcode for performing math incurs a cost presumably because it swaps into codeEAXcode to do the actual piece of math. Here is at least one source that states the possibility httpwww.swansontec.comsregisters.html.p  pI would like to verify and measure these differences in performance characteristics. Thus, I have written this program in Cp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltintrin.hgt include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      int64 startval     int64 stopval     unsigned int value  Keep the value to keep from it being optomized out      startval  rdtsc  Get the CPU Tick Counter using assembly RDTSC opcode       Simple Math a  a ltlt 3  0x0054E9     asm          mov ebx, 0x1E532  Seed         shl ebx, 3         add ebx, 0x0054E9         mov value, ebx           stopval  rdtsc     int64 val  stopval  startval     cout ltlt Result  ltlt value ltlt  gt  ltlt val ltlt endl      int i     cin gtgt i      return 0  codepre  pI tried this code swapping codeeaxcode and codeebxcode but Im not getting a stable number.  I would hope that the test would be deterministic the same number every time because its so short that its unlikely a context switch is occurring during the test.  As it stands there is no statistical difference but the number fluctuates so wildly that it would be impossible to make that determination. Even if I take a large number of samples the number is still impossibly varied.p  pId also like to test codexor eax, eaxcode vs codemov eax, 0code, but have the same problem.p  pIs there any way to do these kinds of performance tests on Windows or anywhere else When I used to program Z80 for my TICalc I had a tool where I could select some assembly and it would tell me how many clock cycles to execute the code  can that not be done with our newfangeled modern processorsp  pEDIT There are a lot of answers indicating to run the loop a million times.  To clarify, this actually makes things worse. The CPU is much more likely to context switch and the test becomes about everything but what I am testing.p

If theres a problem then roll back everything that happened and if everything was good then commit it. Its all worked quite great but theres just one flaw that Ive come across so far.  I added Exception logging so I can see when there are issues that users face. But the problem is, if the table that logs the errors is InnoDB then its also included in the transaction and will rollback if theres a problem so no errors are stored.  To get around this I basically just made the Error logging table MyISAM so when a rollback is done, the changes are still there.p  pNow Im thinking of other bits Id like to keep out of the transaction, like sending a mail within my application to the admin to help alert of problems.p  pIs there any sort of way for me to not include a database insert within the parent transaction Have I taken a bad route in terms of ApplicationDB design and is there any other way I could have handled thisp  pThanks, Dominicp

Negative 8 pI am writing a simulation which requires a backing database to store the results. The simulation writes a huge amount of data.

The simulation creates realizations in a scenario in parallel, so many realizations and calculated at the same time and inserted into the scenario the simulation is currently working on. p  pHowever, in NoSQL, specifically MongoDB, relations are bad and slow, so I should make use of embedded documents as much as possible.

Negative 8 pI am new to MVC so this is my first attempt and I am sure you guys can give me improvement on this, thanks for any tips or helpp  pBelow is what I have come up with for a routerdispatcher system for my personal framework I am working on, it is my first attempt at using the MVC pattern.p  pThe first block of code is just my .htaccess file which routes all request through my index.php file.  p  pThe second block of code is my array of Routes which will tell the Router object, which class and method to call as well as any ID or paging numbers if they exists.p  pThird block of code is the router class.p  pFourth block is just running the classp  pSo the router class has to use regex to match the URI with a route in the route map, in theory, this just sounds like bad performance when there is a list of 50 routes that the regex has to run on, should I be doing this differently  The main reason I use the regex is to match page numbers and ID numbers when they exists in the route.p  pAlso please do not just tell me to use a framework, I am doing this to learn it better, I learn better this way and just prefer to not use an existing framework at this time, I have studies all the main ones and some less common ones for ideas already.p  p1 So the main question, does anything just not look rightp  p2 Is there a better way to detect what is in the URI than using the regex on an array like I am doing, consider it on a high traffic sitep  p3 Since everything is routed through the index.php file with this, how would I go about handling AJAX requestsp  pSorry if this is

Negative 8 pIm exploring Mongo as an alternative to relational databases but Im running into a problem with the concept of schemaless collections. p  pIn theory it sounds great, but as soon as you tie a model to a collection, the model becomes your defacto schema. You can no longer just add or remove fields from your model and expect it to continue to work. I see the same problems here managing changes as you have with a relational database in that you need some sort of script to migrate from one version of the database schema to the other. p  pAm I approaching this from the wrong angle What approaches do members here take to ensure that their collection items stay in sync with their domain model when making updates to their domain modelp  pEdit Its worth noting that these problems obviously exist in relational databases as well, but Im asking specifically for strategies in mitigating the problem using schemaless databases and more specifically Mongo.

Negative 8 pWe use PayPals Payments Pro NVP API to provide seamless credit card and paypal processing on our site.

The API uses a redirect when clicking the PayPal logo but then PayPals code seems to run a framebusting script and the transaction cant continue.p  pI am seeking suggestions or sample code for how to handle users wishing to PayPal for their payment via the iframe.  One option is to popup a new window but then it leaves the design open to issues since the user can switch between that window and the window containing the iframe and conceivably get the cart out of sync with what the PayPal window is displaying. p

Negative 8 pI have an ASP.NET MVC 3 application and am using Ninject for injecting dependencies into my classes.p  pActions on the Controllers pass ViewModels that do not contain logic to the view layer.p  pWhen a HTTP form is POSTed MVC 3 creates a ViewModel instance and binds the incoming POST data to the ViewModels properties.

Negative 8 pHave a small problem here in WP eCommerce. When I add items to my cart, my cart widget reflects the changes immediately using AJAX. However, if there are items in my cart and I refresh the page, my cart shows 0 items by default when there are still actually items in my cart.

Negative 8 pIs it possible for a USB device to tell the host which alternate interfaces to use, either during startup or any other timep  pI know about the GETINTERFACE and SETINTERFACE interface requests, but my impression is that the host will just assume alternate interface 0 is in effect on startup  at least for HID devices.  Im hoping to find some way around this without writing a host driver.p  hr  pemBackgroundem Im working on a personal project involving converting various PS2 and other devices to USB HID.  Normally you wouldnt need a driver for this since OSs tend to support such devices natively.  However, for the keyboard interface I would like to provide several NKRO options, so some keyboard interfaces will have more than the standard 6modifier keys.  This works fine natively in the OSs Ive tried, but I would like to allow the user to choose which keyboard interface to use.  Ideally this would be saved on the device and take effect again on startup, so I dont need to provide a driver for the device.p

Negative 8 pI was hoping someone could help clarify my options regarding refactoring methods from codebehinds from ASP.NET webforms pages.p  pAs background, we have spent some time recently implementing the repository pattern in both a generic and non generic sense, which has enabled us to move a lot of the DAL methods out of the codebehinds, which is great.p  pWhat Im struggling to finalise, is a sensible approach to moving application logic methods out of the codebehinds which specific focus on the repositoryDAL and how best to structure the BL classes.p  pHere are the two options I am considering at presentp  p1.Create a Business Logic class per codebehind and from this, expose         methods like codegetProjectint idcode which would behind the scenes,         access a repository instance of coderepo.GetByIdint idcodep  pThe benefit of this as far as I can see would be the followingp  ul liseperate app logic from the codebehinds, allowing them to be simpleli liallowing testable methods at the BLL with some tweaking, kind of synonymous with controller classes in MVC this is still webforms thoughli liDoesnt expose the repository directlyli ul  pThe downside would bep  ul liA lot of wrapper methods in the BLL which dont really do anything besides hide the repository methodsli ul  p2.Write extension methods on my entity types, e.g. codeProject.getUserscode which would access a repository instance method  allowing BL to be stored without the need for a specific BLL class, thereby reducing the duplication of the wrapper methods in each BL class. p  pThe benefit of this would bep  ul liNo need to have a BL as such, storing methods with their entity typeli liLess wrapper methods, as there wouldnt be a need for codeProjectBL.getUsersprojectidcode and codeUserBL.getUsersprojectidcode which both call coderepo.getProjectUsersprojectidcode behind the scenes, simple codeProject.getUserscode from both codebehindsli ul  pThe downside of this as far as I can tellp  ul liIf I introduce new types in the future, e.g. SubProject codegetUserscode needs to be reimplimentedli liIm not too keen on extension methods in general and not sure if this is the right place to use themli ul  pIm a little unsure which is better practice, or if Ive missed a better option all together. It may be worth knowing that initially the repository was being instantiated in the codebehind and accessed directly, but as I understand things, this is not ideal as we risk returning things like IQueryable from the repository and making DAL methods which can be manipulated in codebehind to produce inconsistent results.p

Negative 8 pAfter days of research and recoding I am pretty much stumped.  My goal is to get a test app running with a single tableview populated from two separate fetchedResultControllers.  p  pI have a series of items on a shopping list, each with a department and a boolean collected flag.  Uncollected items should be listed by department, followed by a single section containing all collected items regardless of department.  As a user checks off uncollected items, they should move down to the collected section.  If she unchecks a collected item, it should move back into its correct department.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsgBVY.png altenter image description herep  pTo achieve the first part uncollected items, I set up a simple fetchedResultsController that fetches all items where collected  NO, and sectioned the results by departmentp  precode NSFetchedResultsController firstFRC       Set up the fetched results controller if needed.     if firstFRC  nil            Create the fetch request for the entity.

I also wire up this image which is on a button to toggle from checked to unchecked when it is touched, and update the item accordingly.p  pThis part all works fine.  I can view my list of items by department, and when I mark one as collected, I see it drop off the list as expected.p  pNow I attempted to add the bottom section, containing all of the collected items in a single section.  First I set up a second fetchedResultsConroller, this time to fetch only uncollected items, and without sectioning.  I also had to update the followingp  precode NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView       Return the number of sections  add one for collected section     return firstFRC.sections.count  1    NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection       Return the number of rows in the section     if section lt firstFRC.sections.count          return [[firstFRC.sections objectAtIndexsection] numberOfObjects]          else          return secondFRC.fetchedObjects.count         NSString tableViewUITableView tableView titleForHeaderInSectionNSIntegersection      if section lt firstFRC.sections.count          return [[[firstFRC sections] objectAtIndexsection] name]          else         return Collected       codepre  pI then updated the cellForRowAtIndexPath in a similar fashion, so that the item I retrieve comes from the right FRCp  precode    Item item     if indexPath.section lt firstFRC.sections.count          item  [firstFRC objectAtIndexPathindexPath]          else          item  [secondFRC objectAtIndexPath[NSIndexPath indexPathForRowindexPath.row inSection0]]           [[cell textLabel] setText[item name]]  rest of cell configuration codepre  pThis works great when I launch.

Negative 8 pHi Socket Programming experts,p  pI am writing a proxy server on Linux for SQL server 20052008 running on Windows.  The proxy is coded using bsd sockets and in C, and it is working fine with a problem described below.p  pWhen I use a database client written in JAVA, and running on a Linux box to fire queries with a concurrency of 100 or more directly to the Database server, not experiencing connection resets. But through my proxy I am experiencing many connection resets.p  pDigging deeper I came to know that connection from DB client to Proxy always succeeds but when the Proxy tries to connect to the DB server the connection fails, due to the SYN packet getting RST,ACK.p  pThat was to give some background. The question is  Why does sometimes SYN receives RST,ACK p  precodeDB clientlinux to Serverwindows  gt Works fine DB clientlinux to ProxyLinux to Serverwindows gt problematic codepre  pI am aware that this can happen in connection refused case but this definitely is not that one. SYN flooding might be another scenario, but that does not explain fine behavior while firing to Server directly.p  pI am suspecting some socket option setting may be required, that the client does before connecting and my proxy does not. Please put some light on this. Any help links or pointers is most appreciated.p  pAdditional infop  pWrote a C client that does concurrent connections, which takes concurrency as an argument. Here are my observations     At 5000 concurrency and above, some connects failed with connection refused.    Below 2000, it works fine. p  pBut the actual problem is observed even at a concurrency of 100 or more.  Note The problem is time dependent sometimes it never comes at all and sometimes it is very frequent and DB client directly to server works fine at all times .p

Negative 8 pI have a Document Sequence table with 1 row and 1 column. All it does is have a sequence number. Every time we need to create a new document, we call a stored proc which updates the existing sequence number in this table by 1 and read that and use that for id in the document table. p  pMy question is If multiple requests try to call this stored proc which updates the sequence number and returns it, is there a chance it will give the same number to multiple callers I right now have another stored proc which calls this seq number generator sp in a transaction and then create a document with the obtained id. I was wondering if I had to do it with just entity framework in code and not use the stored proc, is it possible Will Entity framework 4 support transaction by itself so that only one process is calling the seq updater sp at a time p

Negative 8 pI have a website where users upload photos using jQuery File Upload and I then provide the service of manually Photoshopping those photos and emailing them back to them when Im done. p  pThis is a demo of the upload tool Im using  a hrefhttpblueimp.github.comjQueryFileUpload relnofollowhttpblueimp.github.comjQueryFileUploadap  pThe process goes like thisp  ol liUser visits the website and uploads one or more photosli liUser fills in a textbox with specific instructions regarding how they want the photo manipulatedli liUser chooses one of three perphoto price options.  For example, if one option is 50 per photo and they upload three photos, theyd pay 150 li liUser pays for the service and waits 3  5 days while I work on the photos before I email them the resultli ol  pI have three Amazon Simple Pay buttons on the page, one for each price option.  I have this setup and tested.  However, once the user pays and then returns to the site, I have no way of knowing what photos they uploaded.  Those photos will simply exist on my server, but I dont have any way of associating them to the specific user and his payment.  What I want to accomplish is for the Amazon Pay Now button to first upload the photos I can bind a jQuery trigger event for this, then send them, along with a custom JSON packet of data to either Amazon or my own server where that data is temporarily held until the payment processing succeeds, and then email the data to me.  p  pOnce it succeeds, Amazon already sends me an email with info about the transaction, but I also want it to include my JSON data as well as the uploaded photos.p  pThe goal is to make the payment process rock solid so that the uploaded photos are always firmly associated with the payment, so as to minimize any potential errors by the user. As for myself, I dont want to ever accidentally associate a users uploads with another user, which is why I want a way for the entire payment process to package everything together for me.  Ive been reading the Amazon Simple Pay documentation, but I havent found anything that tells me how to send data to Amazon and include it in the verification or failure emails it sends to me.  p  pMy question is, is this even possible  And if so, what techniques should I use to accomplish it  p

It looks like thisp  precode in my headers typedef var object[][2] typedef var array[]    in user code var foo  array 1, b, true  var bar  object  name, Bob ,  age, 42   codepre  pThis works out pretty nicely. The problem comes in with nested lists.p  precodevar foo  array 1, b, array 3.1, 3.2   codepre  pFor some reason my variant class interprets the nested array as a boolean, givingp  precode[1, b, true] codepre  pInstead ofp  precode[1, b, [3.1, 3.2]] codepre  pIf I explicitly cast the inner list to a var, it worksp  precodevar foo  array 1, b, vararray 3.1, 3.2   codepre  pWhy do I have to explicitly cast the inner list to a var after I cast it to an array, and how can I get around this extra cast As far as I can tell it should be implicitly converting the array to my var class anyway, since its using the constructor for an array of varsp  precodetemplate ltsizet lengthgt varconst varampstart[length]     internal stuff   init   setFromArrayvectorltvargtstart, start  length  codepre  pIt seems that without the explicit cast to var, the initialization list somehow gets cast to something else on its way from being cast from an array to a var. Im trying to understand why this happens, and how to avoid it.p  hr  pHeres a hrefhttpsgist.github.com3392320 relnofollowa gista with the complete source. Let me know if I should add anything relevant to the question.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pApparently codefoo1, twocode does not actually cast an initialiation list its a complete expression called a a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccCompoundLiterals.htmlCompoundLiterals relnofollowcompound literala. It seems that its only available in C, although g doesnt complain unless you give it codepedanticcode.p  pIt looks like my options arep  ul liFind another concise initialization syntax that is officially supported.li liUse compound literals and hope they work in other compilers.li liDrop support for C lt 11 and use initializerlist.li liDont offer a concise initialization syntax.li ul  pAny help with the first option would be the sort of answer Im looking for at this point.p  pMacros are another sort of lastditch option, and Ive written some that do the job, but Id like to not have to use them.p

Negative 8 pFirst off, I saw similar posts already, but they werent exactly what I am asking. p  pI used the Facebook Dev to create a like button for my website, stuck the code in and the the button showed up. The only issue is that it likes the wrong url when I click the button.p  pIm pretty sure the issue is that I have it set to redirect automatically from mydomain.com to the most recent post. I think this is gumming up the works with the like button and causing it to like mydomain.commostrecentpost instead of simply liking mydomain.com.p  pIs there a way to correct this issue without having to get rid of the redirect because that isnt an optionp  pSorry if that was a little wordy, wanted to make sure I explained the issue fully.p

Negative 8 pstrongWhat I wantstrongp  pI have a situation where I want to show affiliate ads on my website. These are basically javascripts, with content within them. As my site has a responsive design, I want to load different ads depending on the jQuery innerwidth property. So summed up I want to load different javascripts depending on the innerwidth property.p  pstrongWhat I have donestrongp  pI load two different javascripts in hiddenfields, and depending on the innerwidth, I show either one with the div.html command. However, this gives the potentially dangerous request.form error when the user submits a post ASP.NET defence of XSS, as the content loaded has dangerious characthers, which makes sense.p  pI could say ValidateRequestfalse on all pages, but thats a horrible solution which would open a lot of security problems.p  pstrongMy thoughts...strongp  pThe best way would be to load the ads from the serverside, but we dont know the browser width here. From what Ive been able to read, it seems hard  impossible to get the innerwidth value at pageload.p  pBut I would like to load my ads without making a potentially dangerious request.p  pAny ideas on how to solve thisp

Negative 8 pDue to network architecture of our software, our application servers cannot connect directly to the web service of our customer. Because of this we have an integration server between the application servers and customers servers. This integration server hosts a proxy web service. The problem is that the necessary credentials and some other additional information needs to be passed from the database at our application server to our proxy web service at the integration server.p  pI wouldnt want to pollute the API and pass the object containing credentials and additional information on each web service request. Additionally we have multiple integration servers which can be shut down at will so I cannot just initialize the web service with credentials and other information in a separate method because the subsequent web service requests might be passed to another integration server.p  pIs there a way to add some kind of SoapExtension which could be used to pass the information to my web service instance on each method If not, is there something else I could do besides adding an argument to each web method and use that to pass the informationp

Negative 8 pI have a question regarding on how to save and load game automatically. In this example, like emTemple Runem, it automatically saved the game on everything records, money gained, and unlocked goodies as straightforward as it seems. Comparing to the PlayStation 1 game, lets say emAbes Exodusem for example, it doesnt have an auto saveload feature but it can save the game on the exact location of the area within the level of the game where Abe left and when you load the game, it automatically starts the game on the last location left within this level.p  pNow, Im trying to test this feature of the auto load and save game by this simple app Ive made, here are the sequence that Ive expecting to succeed the followingp  ol liOpen the app for the first time and if this app is new, the movable sprite will start at the center by default.li liNext, I tried to move the sprite by tilting the device and placed it no top.li liThen, when I close the app by using the emBACKem key and not the emHOMEem key to close the app by disposal.li liFinally, when I reopen the app, whenever that coordinate I placed it on the sprite will be the new starting point.li ol  pMy program has some bugs on it.

Unfortunately, this is not acceptable for my purposes.p  ul liMy handler simply passes the incoming bytes to a backend storage system virtual machine disk repository, and waiting for the whole disk to be written to a cache only to be read again takes a lot of time, tying up a lot of resources, and reducing throughput.li liThere is a cost associated with writing the blocks and reading them again, since the app is running in the cloud, and the cloud provider charges per block readwritten.li liSince every byte is written to the local disk, my service VM must have enough disk space to accommodate the total sizes of all the streams being uploaded i.e., if I have 10 uploads of 100GB each, I must have 1TB of disk just to cache the content. That again is extra money, as the size of the service VM grows dramatically, and the cloud provider charges for the provisioned disk size as well.li ul  pGiven all of this, I am looking for a way to use the HTTP InputStream or as close to it as possible to read the attachment directly from there and handle it afterwards. I guess the question translates into one of   Is there a way to tell CXF not do caching  OR  is there a way to pass CXF an output stream one I write to use, rather than using CachedOutputStreamp  pI found a similar question a hrefhttpmailarchives.apache.orgmodmboxcxfusers200907.mbox3C24677330.posttalk.nabble.com3E relnofollowherea.

Negative 8 pIve got an application which is identifying motion in a webcam image. It produces something like the following...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDexHs.png altenter image description herep  pAreas in black indicate motion. This is largely done on a perpixel basis although nearby pixels are taken into accountp  pSo... Now that Ive got a movement truefalse for each pixel, I need to use that information to identify object outlines.p  pWhat Id like is something like the following. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2tr6D.png altenter image description herep  pOutlines dont have to be precise and I could accept a bounding box. There are also some areas of noise which are more visible if I show you both combined...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8uEKY.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see there are a couple of movement pixels outside the objects. Presumably, Id eliminate these by specifying a minimum area for an object.p  pSo, what algorithms are there for identifying the edges of objects. Ideally, Id then be able to use this information to calculate the approximate center of each object.p  pNote As mentioned by mmgp, the images above are all full RGB, even the BampW one. This is due to the way Im generating the image for export. Internally, its a Bit array.p

Negative 8 pI have a multithreaded program whose thread number could be customized. The program is responsible for generating HTTP requests, sending the requests to a web service, receiving response and parsing the response to get some result value. p  pSince it takes almost 1 sec for each request to get the response, to make the program get as many responses as possible, multiple threads are started. p  pFollowing code is used to start multithreads p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecode    ...     for int i  0 i lt threadNum i          threadArray[i]  new ThreadrequestGeneratorArray[i]         threadArray[i].start           for int i  0 i lt threadNum i          try              threadArray[i].join          catch InterruptedException e              logger.errore               codepre  p...p  pWhen the thread number is 50, and totally 10K requests are generated and sent, the program works well. When the thread number is still 50, and the total request number is 100K. The program was hanging when 95K requests were sent. No exception existed, and the program just hanging there. p  pAnd then I add a few JVM arguments like this java Xmx1024M Xms512M XXMaxPermSize256m ... With such arguments, 50 threads 100K request worked. However, 50 threads 1M requests was hanging again. I set the thread number to 20 and request number as 1M, it worked again.p  pI want to set the thread number to 50, since as tested with fewer requests number 10K, 50 threads makes the highest efficiency. The request number could be much larger as 10M, 100M, event 1B. In this cases, it would not be a good idea to increase the size of Xmx Xms or MaxPermSize. What should I do Whats the root cause of program hanging p  pp  pI used Executor Service instead of threads directly. But the problem occurred as well. I rechecked the code, and found there is a mistake  I instantiated a HttpClient object for each request. I changed the code to instantiated a HttpClient instance for each thread, and the program doesnt hang anymore. p  pI think the root cause of program hanging is that it set up too many HTTP connections to the web service, and used out all threads of the web service. That made the web service cannot answer to any new arrived requests. Is it correct   p

Negative 8 pI am trying to understand different artifacts around implementing Tridion XPM. Unfortunately I did not find any article that has answers to my questions. p  pFor example Content delivery server on WebSphere can have four different applications, one for Content deliverywhich handles publishing, one for web service oData implementation, one for XPM with Session preview and the actual preview application. I am assuming we can merge one or more of these applications into one for a simple implementation with one or two consuming websites.p  pMy questions arep  ol liHow can we simplify the number of applications WARs to be made Though I always prefer to keep the preview application separate from Tridions framework. What are the benefits around Content Delivery session preview Web service as a standalone JavaJSP Web application Versus adding it to existing applicationli liHow can I associateintegrate webserviceoData to XPM or other common basic functionality like component linkingli ol  pFor example if I publish a page with out enabling oData it will split codetridionComponentLinkcode tag where as if I enable it will split codetcdlLinkcode tag. So I need to come up with custom class to read these tags which eventually require adding Tridion framework in the preview application. Assuming I did not include any Tridion framework in my preview to have a clean application dependency p  pI looked at Tridions live site for more information, but I could not find much useful info for my questions.p

Negative 8 pI have a bunch of objects that I need to be able to serialize in JSON, PHP, whatnot. I have stuff such as a JSONSerializer, and clearly have serialize available. Now what I still need is object specific logic to turn the objects into something that can be fed to JSONSerializer or serialize. Basically either a primitive type or an array containing only elements matching this condition.p  pTwo questionsp  ol lipHow do you call this step before serialization arrayification Im thinking of giving my objects a toArray method. I also want them to implement some interface that specifies this method Anyone a better idea then Arrayablepli lipHow can I go best about unserialization I could have a static newFromArray method in each object. Not fond of static code though. Any opinions on a factory that can construct objects of a given type from their arrayificationpli ol  pNote This needs to work with PHP 5.3.p

Negative 8 pIm building a PHP application with an API that has be able to respond very rapidly within 100ms to all requests, and must be able to handle up to 200 queries per second requests are in JSON, and responses require a DB lookup  save every time. My code runs easily fast enough very consistently around 30ms for single requests, but as soon as it has to respond to multiple requests per second, the response times start jumping all over the place.p  pI dont think its a memory problem PHPs memory limit is set to 128MB and the codes memory usage is only around 3.5MB or a MySQL problem the code embeforeem any DB request is as likely to bottleneck as the bit that interacts with the DB.p  pBecause the timing is so important, I need to get the response times as consistent as possible. So my question is are there any simple tweaks I can make to php.ini or Apache to stabilise PHPs response times when handling multiple simultaneous requestsp

Negative 8 pWe are relatively new to Maven and now face a problem.p  pWe have a Maven project projectA whose JAR is the dependency of several other projects.  Some of the other projects are some custom web container while others are not, so some of projectAs dependency jars are provided in the case of the custom web container, but should be runtime scope in the case of other projects. We currently use exclusion list to filter out the provided jars in the case of the custom web container.p  pWe are wondering if it would be better to use maven profiles.  We know how to create the profiles with different dependencies actually same dependencies different scope, and in both profiles, the built projectA jar is identical bitwise.  But what we dont  know is, when we deployrelease the projectA jar artifact to a maven repository, what should the pom.xml look like  For these web container projects, the pom.xml should not include the provided jars, but for other projects, the pom.xml should include these jars.  p  pWe can use a different name for the jar in each profile and deploy each with a different pom.xml, but since these jars are identical bitwise, it doesnt seem like a perfect solution.  So we thought theres gotta be a better solution to this problem, only that we dont know since we are relatively new to Maven.  Thanks.p

Negative 8 pHeres our problem we have a product that we use an Installscript MSI to install.  At one point we switched to a completely new Installscript MSI to handle versioning properly and restructure the features.  During this time, a majority of the installer remained the same, such as our database.  At more than one installation site, since the database already existed, and we didnt want the installer to dropcreate the database, we decided to uncheck the database feature.p  pFast forward a year, we are now doing product upgrades that modify the structure of the database.  Because we neglected to install the database feature when we ran the newer installer, these SQL scripts are not being run.  This is a major problem since we would like to continue upgrading our product in this manner.  My question is is there a simple way of altering the installation MSI database so that the database feature is considered to be installedp  pSome stipulations We are not considering the option to rerun the setup and add the feature that way.  The installer was not properly designed to handle this elegantly.p

Negative 8 pI have a pretty basic form with a textbox and a submit button. The form is supposed to accept an email and send it to a PHP page for processing, via an ajax request. The form is not actually submitted though. Instead, an onSubmit event is used to call a function, where the Ajax request is made if the email is of valid format.

Negative 8 pWe have an application built in WPF. For reports we are using the Winforms host to display and preview the report.

Negative 8 pAs the title states, Im interested in differences between stopping the debugging process in the VS 2010 and closing that application after it is installed. The reason Im asking this is that I get a weird problem with my application  this application employs several parentchild form connections. The data transfer works fine, and this is the code I use to enable itp  pIn the child formp  precodepublic ParentForm Parent  get set  codepre  pAnd in parent formp  precodeChildForm CF  new ChildForm CF.ParentForm  this CF.ShowDialog codepre  pIn the parent form I mark the variables or methods that need to be shared as public, and the data transfermodulation works fine.  The problem Im getting is with a smart card reader. It should be called from one of the child forms specifically third generation child form, and simply read the cards ID number. The problem is that this works perfectly the first time the child form is created, but stops working completely every next time the child form has no special method defined in its FromClosing or FormClosed methods. I managed to cheat my way out, and defined the reader specific data in the parent root generation form, and it works properly now, but Im worried about what will happen when I install the application I cant start with testing yet because the destination workstations are not available to me yet  to be specific, will the reader stop working the first time the user closes the application.

Negative 8 pMy question exactly wants to know whether it is possible to upload all files first and then extract their metadata later sometimes I am developing a web api which will allow me to upload files and extract their metadata.  The way I have been using to extract metadata is to upload one file at a time and extract its metadata and print it out. I wish to implement this on strongclient sidestrong javascript and also be able to allow users to download the uploaded files from the server  a dropbox like implementation which also allows metadata manipulation . Is it possiblep  pA very sincere thanks for your timep

Negative 8 pI understand this is an issue that has been fixed in .NET 4.0 however, upgrading our framework is not an option as of yet. SOON, but not yet. For the time being I am using .NET 3.5. p  pAs Ive seen in many other posts that this is a very common issue. Nobody really seems to say why it is an issue, which is why it seems like many answers dont seem to grasp the actual problem. p  pWhen using aspTable control or aspGridView control, the generated markup looks as suchp  precodeltaspTable idtable1 border0 runatservergtltaspTablegt  codepre  pGridview is much the same but includes a rules attribute that can be ommitted by setting the Gridlines property to none. However, while setting gridlines to none takes care of the rules attribute, the border0 always remains. p  pstrongNow the problemstrong in order to Validate this code using W3 validator, the border property MUST be set to border OR border1. This seems like a very simple fix, further investigation proves quite the contrary. p  pIve tried to change the value to something the validator will acceptp  piep  precodetable1.Attributes.Addborder, 1  This generates ltaspTable idtable1 border0 border1 runatservergtltaspTablegt  table1.Attributes.Addborder, null  This generates ltaspTable idtable1 border0 border runatservergtltaspTablegt  table1.Attributes[border]  1   This generates ltaspTable idtable1 border0 border1 runatservergtltaspTablegt  table1.Attributes[border]     This generates ltaspTable idtable1 border0 border runatservergtltaspTablegt  table1.Attributes.Removeborder  This generates ltaspTable idtable1 border0  runatservergtltaspTablegt codepre  pNone of these have reached the desired result. aspTable always generates border0 and I cant seem to modify the value. p  pDoes anyone have any other ideas, and again, upgrading the framework is not an option for the time being. We will be upgrading at some point in the relatively near future  but not before this version goes to production. p  pMany Thanksp

Negative 8 pI would like some help in trying to create a set of string variables which are dependent on string with even length. So, one would be given the string codestr0code, which has size, say 100, and I want to store every two cells in codestr0code in another string called codestr1code, and so on that is, if I letp  blockquote   pstr0  8517009663267111443765353568345207927294601110028317841194534479270436162474731520343936822627589531,p blockquote  pthen I would like somehow to have a gadget which pushes every two digits in codestr0code into a another string called codestricode where codeicode is the nth twodigit combo in codestr0code, namely we would havep  blockquote   pstr1  85p      pstr2  17p      pstr3  00p      pstr4  96,p blockquote  pand so on. But this would change in accordance with the size of the input string codestr0code, so every time the user runs it shehe can stream different sized strings to produce a set of codestr0.size2code string variables. The whole idea here is that Im trying to convert these strings codestr1code, ..., codestrncode into integers in a for loop or something later on, but I can do that myself.p
Negative 8 pIm trying to find a constant something like a secret token from inside of an iOS app in order to build an app using an undocumented web API by the way, Im not into something illegal. So far, I have the decrypted app executable on my Mac jailbreak  SSH  dumping decrypted executable as file. I can use the strings command to get a readable list of strings, and I can use the classdump tool a hrefhttpstevenygard.comprojectsclassdump relnofollowhttpstevenygard.comprojectsclassdumpa to get a list of interface definitions headers of the classes. Although this gives me an idea of the apps inner workings, I still cant find what Im searching for the constants Im looking for. There are literally thousands of string definitions in the strings command dump. Is there any way to dump the strings in a way that I can have the names of the NSString constants with their values. I dont need the implementation details of the methods, I know that its compiled and all I can get is assembly code.

Negative 8 pI have to read an external XML file from a website. I am either going to use XMLReader, XMLDocument or Serialization. I need to read this external xml file and then send the values to C object. Once I have it loaded I need to perform some calculations on some of the fields. These calculations will be stored in fields that are different from the XML file. The reason being my database schema is different form the XML schema. I will need a mixture of the XML fields and new fields to be inserted into the database. Once I perform these calculations I need to send the results to my database. Should I create two objects  One for XML schema and one for Database Or should I just create the XML schema and add the extra fields that I need to be inserted into the database Also what would be the best approach for this XMLReader, XMLDocument or Serializationp

Negative 8 pWorking with IP4 addresses, which obviously can be stored in 32 bits.  I need to keep track of a list of ips, which can be a fairly long list, so would like to keep it tight as possible.

So, my question is how can I remove a listener before an event takes place The problem is that I have three listeners in my tree, and on codecheckchangecode I want to prevent the codeitemclickcode event. But everything executes in an unexpected order. The code isp  precodecheckchangefunctionnode,check                              alert1 , itemclickfunctionview,rec,item,index,eventObj   alert2 , renderfunction   Ext.getCmpmytree.oncheckchange,functionnode,check     alert0     Ext.getCmpmytree.removeListeneritemclick,this     codepre  pWhen I check a node in my tree, I first see codealert2code, then codealert1code and only then codealert0code. So, the code which should remove the listener happens at the very end and I want the opposite.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI do not want to completely remove the codeitemclickcode event. The more appropriate word is to stop an event, to prevent it from happening.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe solution is to do e.getTarget check inside the itemclick event. So, my code inside the codeitemclickcode event now looks like thisp  precodeitemclickfunctionview, record, item, index, e, eOpts   ife.getTargetspan,1,true       all other code which should take place in case       itemclick event does not come from checkbox element     codepre
Negative 8 pIve been looking for quite a while how I can increase the UDP Buffer, without a solution.p  pI have some kind of a Webcam which send over UDP JPEG Images. These are divided by the cam no MTU fragmentation in datagram packets of 1024 Bytes. When the Image size gets near 65K, the Image gets erroneous because of lost packets. I think this is because of the maximum message size of 655270xfff7 of the UDP Transport Provider, what you can see with SpOrder.exe in the Windows SDK.p  pI have tried to change this size with the function WSCUpdateProvider from Ws232.dll.

So, why inner div is responsible for this Somebody told me to make a different stylesheet for small screen. Though, I cant understand the problem, but shouldnt the solution be simple But, if at last its the only solution to make a different stylesheet for small screen, then what will be the code for that scenario Basically, Im making a website of this a hrefhttpthemes.mysitemyway.cominfocus relnofollowsimilar structurea at where I need lots of thisp  precode.outer     width 100    float left  .inner    width 940px   margin 0 auto  codepre  pI dont want that website would be responsive.

Negative 8 pI have a view controller that consists of two child codeUIContainerViewcodes, one of which is fixedwidth, and the other which dynamically adjusts its width based on portrait vs landscape mode. Both contain codeUITableViewcodes.p  pFor some reason, if the screen loads in portrait orientation it renders fine. However if it loads in landscape and then emrotatesem to portrait, the second dynamic table gets all screwy and thinks its wider than it isshould be, letting you scroll it horizontally which it should emnotem be doing.p  pThe cells of the tableView all size properly and stick to the left side of this too wide tableView. However, if I color the background of the tableview pink, I can see the whole thing is extending into this too wide zone.p  pIts baffling me whats going on here. Shouldnt autolayout be the same regardless of which orientation the view controller was loaded asp  pIf I log the widths in a codeviewDidRotate...code handler, everything appears to have the correct width, yet its still rendering in this bizarre way.p  pIs there perhaps I way I can just force the container view to relay it self outp  pstrongUpdatestrong It is the codecontentSizecode of the tableView that is getting messed up. All the other widths are correct when logged, but the contentSize.width is way off.

Negative 8 pAs many, I am also switching to Android Studio. The Android project I have is a IntelliJ Classic project with two key dependencies the google play services and the facebook SDK. Ive swithced a project to the new Gradlebased build withthe play servies, which is rather straightforward but I fear switching the Facebook SDK library is not that easy. p  pIve heard and seen the usage of aar in the dependencies. Does this dependency style exist for teh facebook SDK already I assume there must be others out there who use the facebook sdk with a new Android Studio  Gradle based build. p  pIt would be great to get a stepbystep instruction how to get this done. p

Negative 8 pI have some C code on Windows that uses plain old ADO not ADO.NET to retrieve data from a bunch of SQL Server databases. The code uses forwardonly cursors to allow for fire hose cursors for maximum data throughput on queries that produce large Recordsets.p  pThe code that processes the results looks like this, using the importgenerated wrapper for ADO 2.7p  precodeADODBRecordsetPtr recordsADODB.Recordset  recordsgtOpencmd, varianttstaticcastltIDispatch gtmDBConnection, ADODBadOpenForwardOnly, ADODBadLockReadOnly, ADODBadCmdText  if recordsgtBOF ampamp recordsgtEOF    ... Loop over the recordset and extract data from each record ...  codepre  pProfiling shows that close to 40 of the above loop is spent in the call to BOF and this is having a massive impact on the overall database codes read performance. Because the code uses forward only cursors, its not possible to check the RecordCount property as it is always 1 when using a forward only cursor.p  pIs there another way to either check for an empty Recordset that is not using the BOFEOF check, or a way to speed up this checkp  pThe other alternative that I can think of at the moment is to use one of the other cursor types and check how that will affect data throughput.p

Quick searches on Google and Stack Overflow for getElementById and .style problems in IE6 were fruitless a common problem is false matches due to name attributes, but the div in question has no name attribute. Thanks in advance for any answers helping identify and address this error.p  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         lttitlegtThe Lucky Personlttitlegt             ltstyle typetextcssgt             inputSelectLuckyPerson                              height 150px                 fontsize 60px                          pRowDetails, pSeatDetails, divRowNumber, divSeatNumber                              fontsize 100px                 display inline                          divRowNumber, divSeatNumber                              color 0000FF                          ltstylegt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltdiv idLuckyPersonIsgtltinput typebutton idSelectLuckyPerson valueAnd the lucky person is... onClickGetResultsgtltdivgt         ltp idRowDetailsgtRow number ltdiv idRowNumbergt0ltdivgtltpgt         ltp idSeatDetailsgtSeat number ltdiv idSeatNumbergt0ltdivgtltpgt         ltscriptgt             var MinRow  2             var MaxRow  8             var SeatsInRow  new Array             SeatsInRow[1]  25             SeatsInRow[2]  25             SeatsInRow[3]  27             SeatsInRow[4]  27             SeatsInRow[5]  27             SeatsInRow[6]  27             SeatsInRow[7]  29             SeatsInRow[8]  31             SeatsInRow[9]  31             SeatsInRow[10]  31             SeatsInRow[11]  31             SeatsInRow[12]  33             SeatsInRow[13]  33             SeatsInRow[14]  33             var ShuffleSpeed  200             var RowNumberDisplay  document.getElementByIdRowNumber             var SeatNumberDisplay  document.getElementByIdSeatNumber             var ChosenRow, ChosenSeat             function GetResults                              var IsRunning  CheckStatus                 if IsRunning                                      ChosenRow  ChooseRow                     ChosenSeat  ChooseSeat                     RowNumberDisplay.style  color FF0000                     SeatNumberDisplay.style  color FF0000                     ShowRowResult  window.setIntervalTryRowResult, ShuffleSpeed                     if DelaySeats  false                                              ShowSeatResult  window.setIntervalTrySeatResult, ShuffleSpeed                                                                function ChooseRow                              return Math.floorMath.random  MaxRow  MinRow  MinRow                          function ChooseSeat                              return Math.ceilMath.random  SeatsInRow[ChosenRow]                          function TryRowResult                              TryRow  ChooseRow                 RowNumberDisplay.innerHTML  TryRow                 if TryRow  ChosenRow                                      window.clearIntervalShowRowResult                     document.getElementByIdRowNumber.style  color 0000FF                     if DelaySeats  true                                              ShowSeatResult  window.setIntervalTrySeatResult, ShuffleSpeed                                                                function TrySeatResult                              TrySeat  ChooseSeat                 SeatNumberDisplay.innerHTML  TrySeat                 if TrySeat  ChosenSeat                                      window.clearIntervalShowSeatResult                     document.getElementByIdSeatNumber.style  color 0000FF                                           function CheckStatus                              if RowNumberDisplay.style.color  rgb255, 0, 0  SeatNumberDisplay.style.color  rgb255, 0, 0                                      return false                                  return true                          ltscriptgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 8 pSo for starters, I have a rather complex system that connects to a python web socket to fire off some various Android events. I was more or less given this system in working form on a Mac Mini. I have since ported it to Ubuntu 13.04 with some success. The problem Im running into is with two python scripts Im using to actually trigger these Android events.p  pWhat I have are two .py files, runwsh and performAction. Essentially runwsh is connected to via a socket and told what events to fire. runwsh starts a subprocess for performAction and pipes input to performAction and performActions output back to runwsh.p  pThe first major call is Install in runwsh. runwsh sends this down to performAction which has been running in a while True loop, waiting for input. This may be where the problem lies, but Im not sure. performAction reads in by setting the following using python 2 something so rawinput is standardp  precodeinput  rawinput codepre  pperformAction then checks that by the followingp  precodeif input is None     continue if input  Install     device.installPackagepathToMyApk.apk     runComponent  blah.activityBlah     device.startActivitycomponentrunComponent     time.sleep1     subprocess.call[blahadb, pull, pathToTextFileInAndroid.txt, pathToTextFileInUbuntu.txt]     print Install Successful codepre  pThis is after the initial waitForConnection call to the emulator which does succeed. Now whenever Install is sent down, it just hangs without anything happening. I know this, because no output can ever be read from the runwsh script. For reference, below is the relevant bits from runwsh.p  precodeargs  [pathToMonkeyRunner, pathToPerformAction.py] prog  subprocess.Popenargs, stdinsubprocess.PIPE, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE prog.stdout.readline This is to spit out a printed connection statement for when waitForConnection finishes ... Inside install call inputToWrite  Install prog.stdin.writeinputToWrite s  prog.stdout.readline f  openpathToTextFileInUbuntu.txt, r t  f.read Read from the file and send information back out through the socket codepre  pIve inserted print statements before to verify that the line, s  prog.stdout.readline, is never hit. There are other elif cases for different inputs in performAction, which also fail, but Im just looking at this case for now. The real bugger here though is that when this hangs, I eventually just kill off the python process from the terminal. When Ive done this with the install part commented out and my apk already installed by hand via adb, once the process has been killed, the emulator finally pulls up the activity page like it is supposed to Im running with the window open for debugging purposes, but normally would have nowindow on. Strangest thing in the world. Ive tried inserting various time.sleep calls into the code thinking perhaps if I have a data race, I can steer it one way or another, but alas, this also seems to have failed.p  pPlease, I know this is a huge question in a large system, but any help would be magnificent. I have scoured the web looking for more in depth help with python, monkey runner, and Android with nothing particularly addressing this problem. p  pAlso please ignore any silly typos in the code or my writing. The code I hand copied over from staring at a terminal in a vm rather than actual copy paste. Ive changed the various paths to garbage, but they should be sufficient for understanding. Thanksp
Negative 8 pI have a shared server for PHP and the user account under which the Apache webserver is running is strongnobodystrong and the user for my ftp and cpanel is different lets say strongjokertecstrong.  p  pNow when my webserver creates any folder I have problems renamingdeletingmodifying that folder using cpanel and when my cpanel creates any folder the webserver has problems  doing the same. This is due to the owners of both the folders being different I think.p  pWhat I want to ask is that Is this some kind of server misconfiguration and both the user under which apache runs and the cpanel username should be same  Or I am missing something here As I think we cannot change the user under which php runs for creating folders dynamically.p

Negative 8 pWeve been using chef for our deployments, and it works wonderfully for straightforward scenarios. However, we now want to script out a redundant architecture on our VM infrastructure. Several boxes are clustered together, but running chef scripts prematurely will cause them to fail. For example, we would like to provision a Windows cluster. Server 1 can configure the Failover Cluster feature and then attempt to form the cluster, but since Server 2 is not yet configured, the run will fail.p  pHow should this be done Here are some ideas weve come up withp  ol liDesign the chef runs, knowing that they will fail but will eventually pass when continuously rerunning them. ul liThis is not ideal from an automation standpoint since the feedback will become ambiguous. Did the run fail in an expected way, or did it fail for an unknown reason This would likely require a human to get it set up.  br  br li ulli lipCall knife ssh from a custom recipe to provision Server 2 when the recipe is run on Server 1. For examplep  precodewindowsfeature FailoverClusters do     action install end   ensure server 2 has the cluster feature enabled   this would likely be implemented as a LWRP using the  the KnifeChefSsh class rather than the execute LWRP execute knife ssh nameServer2 recipe[windowsclustersecondary]     action run end   join the second server to this cluster semipseudo code windowscluster server2 do     action join end codepreli lipAlternatively, a coordinator script could be written so that it calls knife ssh in the correct order.

The second time, SQLAzureMW always timed out the source server on the bcp command with large tables a few over 5 GB. Similarly, SSIS Import  Export Wizard also timed out. I found the source server was always the problem so I tried increasing the instances class from an m1.medium to an m1.xlarge to no avail, the source server still always timed out before making any significant progress on the large tables.p  pIn the end I ended up writing my own .NET program that simply ran a SELECT  FROM [table] ORDER BY [id] OFFSET 0 ROWS on the large source tables and pushed the results into SQLBulkCopy on the destination server. Again the source server timed out repeatedly but I wrapped the try and catch statements in a loop that would simply resume the query from the last point where SQLBulkCopy. That being said, Im not exactly thrilled with this solution.p  pIm considering building a solution around the Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Transfer class but Im afraid there might be the same problems with lack of recovery from a broken source connection.p  pId much rather an out of the box solution for this like SQLAzureMW was before tables got too large and that Id expect SSIS Import Export Wizard to be. There has to be a better way.p

Negative 8 pI have been dealing with maven and osgi for a few weeks time now and still get confused regarding dependencies and bundlespackagesplugins. Mainly i cant understand what they are. Because im new to both java and osgimaven its hard for me to visualize how they are connected or what is a part of the other. So not to be too vague ill try to ask a bunch of specific questions.p  p1 As i understand bundles and plugins are same things  just different name. Is package also the same thing I found many debates on the topic should i use importpackage or requirebundle but i cant really understand them before i understand what a package or bundle is.p  p2 Dependencys. For example if i want to use slf4j api i add this dependencyp  precode    ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtorg.slf4jltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtslf4japiltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt1.7.5ltversiongt     ltdependencygt codepre  pBut what does that really mean I understand that adding the dependency will make the usage of slf4j available to me. Can i assume that the thing im depending on is just a compiled project like the one i make locally somewhere in maven repositoryp  p3 Osgi bundles. If my previous notion is correct dependencys are like projects then are bundles like packages under project If so then i assume that one dependency may add the possibility of adding multiple osgi plugins. If so then where can i see what dependency makes what imports available. Im asking this because i noticed that the name i write under importpackage isnt always the same in the dependency.p  p4 When launching osgi configuration in eclipse i have to select plugins. There are some i can select from under target platform and as i understand i have to select all the plugins i imported in manifest. What is this target platform and where did those plugins get therep  pThese are long and probably really stupid questions so i really appreciate any help. Thanks p

Negative 8 pThe problem is self explanatory when running the code where I have two templated classes and one of them is passed into the other.

This app demonstrates an HTTP client. A server is provided with this sample.              The client and server must be deployed on separate machines. Once the server is set up,              the client can set up the ControlChannelTrigger with the HttpClient by clicking Connect.              This sends an HTTP request to the server. Note that the server by default responds by completing the               HTTP request after a delay of 25 seconds. This delay is to ensure the client app can have enough time              to enter suspended state and then receive the incoming HTTP response from the server.              ltTextBlockgt              ltGrid xNameClientSettings Margin5gt                  ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                      ltRowDefinitiongt                      ltRowDefinitiongt                      ltRowDefinitiongt                  ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                  ltTextBlock  Grid.Row0 TextServer Name  TextWrappingWrap VerticalAlignmentCenter StyleStaticResource BasicTextStyle gt                  ltTextBox Grid.Row1 Grid.ColumnSpan2 xNameServerUri TexthttpServerHostNameCCTHttpServerSampledefault.aspx HorizontalAlignmentLeft VerticalAlignmentCenter gt                  ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal Grid.Row2gt                      ltButton xNameConnectButton ContentConnect ClickConnectButtonClick gt                      ltButton xNameClearButton ContentClear Log ClickClearButtonClick gt                  ltStackPanelgt              ltGridgt          ltStackPanelgt          lt Add Storyboards to the visual states below as necessary for supporting the various layouts for the input section gt          ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt              ltVisualStateGroupgt                  ltVisualState xNameInputDefaultLayoutgt                  ltVisualState xNameInputBelow768Layoutgt              ltVisualStateGroupgt          ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt      ltGridgt       ltGrid xNameOutput HorizontalAlignmentLeft VerticalAlignmentTop Grid.Row1gt          ltScrollViewer        HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityDisabled        VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto        HorizontalScrollModeDisabled        VerticalScrollModeEnabled        ZoomModeDisabled        Margin10,4,10,0gt              ltTextBlock xNameDebugTextBlock                      TextWrappingWrap                     StyleStaticResource BasicTextStyle                     IsTextSelectionEnabledTrue gt          ltScrollViewergt          lt Add Storyboards to the visual states below as necessary for supporting the various layouts for the output section gt          ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt              ltVisualStateGroupgt                  ltVisualState xNameOutputDefaultLayoutgt                  ltVisualState xNameOutputBelow768Layoutgt              ltVisualStateGroupgt          ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt      ltGridgt  ltGridgt  codepre  p p  pI would expect the codeScrolViewercode at the bottom and want it to put a scroll bars around the codeTextBlockcode as and when its requires it.p  pThe sample shows debug in the codeTextBlockcode, but when it fills, the entire Layout becomes scrollable rather then just the codeTextBlockcode.p  pCan you tell me why And what I need to do to make the scroll bars appear around the codeTextBlockcode onlyp

Negative 8 pIve started a textbased browser game, using CodeIgniter. I used Doctrine as ORM since then but I face a problem I cant seem to solve with Doctrine My game will have multiple servers to limit the number of players in a single universe and so I have multiple databases  One for user accounts and reference data  One for each server with the servers specific datap  pSome tables from the servers databases have relations to tables from the general database. The problem is Doctrine isnt designed to handle cross database relations. It seems there is a fix to make such joins a hrefhttpwww.doctrineproject.org20090619crossdatabasejoins.html relnofollowhttpwww.doctrineproject.org20090619crossdatabasejoins.htmlap  pBut as author says, its just good for edge cases. In my project, there are a lot of cross database relations, so I prefer not to use this fix.p  pThe only solution I can figure would be to replace Doctrine with an ORM that handles well that type of relations. Does anyone know a good ORM I can use with CodeIgniter corresponding to my needsp  pThanksp

My problem is Im having troubles with the consolidate method.p  pWhat the array would look like before consolidate a,b,c,d are horsesp  panullbnullcdp  pWhat the array would look like after consolidatep  pabcdnullnullp  pSo my logic would be to make a nested for loop. The first loop would search for a null value, once the first loop finds the null value, the second loop would look for a horse and then swap with it. Then the second loop would end and go back to the first loop. So here is what I have right now and it doesnt workit just terminates. Is my logic wrong or is it my syntax thats causing the problemsp  precodepublic void consolidate      int j  0     forint i  0 i lt spaces.lengthi              if spaces[i]  null                      forj  i j lt spaces.length ampamp spaces[j]  null j                                        spaces[i]  spaces[j]             spaces[j]  null                codepre

Based on the trend from previous imports, Id expect the import of 400k to take a bit over a minute. Instead, it churns away for about 57 minutes before running into the heap space error. It seems like I could split this file into 300,000line chunks, but isnt that what USING PERIODIC COMMIT is supposed to do, more or less I suppose I could give Neo4J more memory too, but again, its not clear why I should have to in this scenario.p  pAlso, to be clear, the lookups on both codeSense.uidcode and codeDependencySet.labelcode are indexed, so the lookup penalty for these should be pretty small.

The information it returns is a row for each contact in the contactlist table along with information on the company directorycompany they work for and various other details about the contact from the contact table. So the information looks something like thisp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodecontactlistid  contactid  id  active  id  type    firstname   surname     job       company   directorycompanyid id  name    id 36311   1939    316955375   1   1939    directory   Joe         Bloggs      Deputy Editor       786 786 Herald People   0  36311   1935    316955374   1   1935    directory   Jim         Bloggs      Advertising Manager 786 786 Herald People   0 36311   28034   316955373   1   28034   directory   Jay         Bloggs      News Reporter       786 786 Herald People   0 codepre  pI then went and attempted to modify the above codeSQLcode as additional functionality was required but Ive been seeing unwanted results.

For example, maybe such a requirement constrains the implementation from not rehashing the entire container after an element is removed, but rather only allows it to remove the element from its corresponding bucketp  pWithout such a guarantee in C11, and if I desire my code to be portable, do I have to worry that some elements will be visited multiple times or not at all if I remove an element from an codestdunorderedmapcode during iterationp

Negative 8 pI have just started using the OpenGL ES 2 for android for my little game and have encountered a problem on redrawing the screen on each frame.p  pI have setup a loop on my Renderers onDrawFrame, just a simple [ updateGameLogic  drawGame ] or Thread.sleep loop based on the time lapsed from last drawGame call.  p  pCurrently the updateGameLogic method simply translate the camera to the ve X direction the game is 2d.  p  pIn the drawGame call, I first clear my screen with GLES20.glClearGLES20.GLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLES20.GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT. Then I have 3 glBindTexture and glDrawElements calls for drawing 3 categories of objects with different texture atlas.p  pHere comes the problem, in between each frame drawn on screen, there is a blink of the previous frame appearing which is undesired and makes the game look dizzy. Precisely, say the game is just about to draw frame 3 from frame 2, right before frame 2 vanish and frame 3 appearing, there is a split moment where frame 1 is displayed.  p  pI thought this may be due to the way the GLSurfaceView is buffered by the system so I experimented with calling multiple glClear before drawing but everything stays the same.  Would be grateful if someone can provide some explanation  solution to the problem, and what I have done wrong, thanks. basically paragraph 2 to 4 is all my code so I have not posted it, unless requestedp

Negative 8 pI have a problem with a small project Ive been doing. It is essentially a service allowing queries on a WFS server in a more restful manner. My problem is that the response I receive is complete gibberish, but only when I deploy my project on Red Hat OpenShift or Heroku. On Cloud9 everything works perfectly. Be aware that Ive been using this project as a way to teach myself express and nodejs and that the coding might not be optimal.p  pMy main problem is that the WFS server return the data in ISO88591 with accented characters in french and I lose them when working on the response, they either become gibberish or the  character.p  pI tried two different ways to solve this, both return gibberish when deployed. For the first I extended Request with a codecollectcode method to replace the codeerrorcode, codedatacode and codeendcode event. Basically I query the WFS and if the codeformatcode parameter is passed I transform the response in json with the codexml2jscode node module.p  precodereq.piperequest.getapp.getbaseUrl  ampREQUESTgetcapabilities.collectfunctionerr, body      iferr         return nexterr      ifreq.query.format ampamp req.query.format.toLowerCase  json         parseStringbody,mergeAttrs true, functionerr, result             iferr                 return nexterr              res.json200, result              else ifreq.query.format         res.typeapplicationxml charsetutf8         res.send200, body     else         nextnew ErrorLe paramtre format nest pas du valide.

La valeur accepte est JSON.             codepre  pI still get the same result as the first way I tried. While I normally try to solve my problems myself I think I hit a wall here. Like I said I am still learning about nodejs and express so it might be a really simple thing I did not account for. After reading around I suspect it has something to do with the encoding but what bug me is that it works fine on Cloud9 and it breaks only when deployed.p  pSorry for the long wall of code and text but I wanted to be as clear as possible, English is not my main language so if you need clarifications just ask away.p  pThanksp

Negative 8 pIve got two windows machines running the latest version of cygwin.  I have OpenSSH configured on both of them, and passwordless authentication has been set up for the remote machine.  I can ssh into either machine without problems.  strongAll commands below are executed in cmd.exestrong.  p  pSystem Specification identical for both machines p  ul liCygwin version 1.7.32li liWindows 7li liver from cmd returns Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]li liR 2.14.1li ul  pThe basic form of my problem is this.  I have to start an executable on my remote machine.  I must start this executable via ssh through windows command line, not cygwin.  That executable has a couple parameters.  One of these parameters needs to be encapsulated within double quotes Because I am working with a third party package in R, which makes a call to system, and one parameter expects a string.  The actual parameter is e parallel.slaveRSOCKp  pThe script.exe called below is the file Rscript.exe.  This comes with any to my knowledge installation of R.  I did not create it, compile it, or anything.  It is just utilized by the package I am trying to debug, as it allows you to execute R commands outside of the R console gui. The package I am trying to debug is parallel, which I am using to run parallel processes on remote machines.  I also did not have any hand in creating or compiling this code.p  pMaybe needless additional info, but the portion of the package Im trying to debug is the function that spins up a process on a remote machine.  This function develops a command, given some parameters, and executes this command in cmd.exe.  Im trying to replicate the command and manually execute, as when running through the actual package the process simply hangs.p  pIf I were starting the executable on strongemmyemstrong machine, I would do the following, in windows cmd.p  precodeCPathscript.exe e parallel.slaveRSOCK  codepre  pAnd this works fine. Establishing an ssh connection to the remote machine and subsequently running this command changing C to c also works. p  pBut, when I make the following call for starting this script on the strongemremoteemstrong machine from my machinep  precodessh remoteHost cPathscript.exe e parallel.slaveRSOCK codepre  pI get the following errorp  precodebash c line 0 syntax error near unexpected token  bash c line 0 cPathscript.exe e parallel.slaveRSOCK codepre  pSo Ive lost the double quotes, obviously Im not escaping them correctly.

Negative 8 pI have three flash banners embedded with swfobject in a javascript slider jquery bxslider plugin.

The weird thing is that even though you cant see the animation it simply displays the first frame, at some point bannerEnd is called, so internally the flash animation is working.p  pAt first I thought its because the container with the banner is not visible and tried modifying the slides DOM in hope of triggering a rerender and forcing the browser to start the animation  as seen in onSlideAfter method, but that didnt help. I dont have much experience with flash and couldnt find any relevant solutions or similar problems online, so I dont really know where to look.p  pIts also not the issue of the one particular banner  if you change the order, the problem persists with the last third banner.p  pI isolated the code from the rest of the page and it can be seen here a hrefhttpspang.fraktal.eestepanflashbannerissue relnofollowhttpspang.fraktal.eestepanflashbannerissueap

So how does the constructor need to be in order to keep the old values so I can do the subtraction without storing it in a named variable.p  pThis is my codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltcctypegt include ltcstdlibgt using namespace std  class Time      private      int hours      int minutes      int seconds      void normalize     public      Time hours  minutes  seconds  0 normalize      Timeint x, int y, int z      friend Time operator  const Timeamp t1, const Timeamp t2      friend Time operator  const Timeamp t1, const Timeamp t2      friend bool operator lt const Timeamp t1, const Timeamp t2      friend istreamamp operator gtgtistreamamp ins, Timeamp t1      friend ostreamamp operator ltltostreamamp out, Timeamp t1   TimeTimeint x, int y, int z      hours  x     minutes  y     seconds  z      normalize   void Timenormalize      int s  seconds     int m  minutes     int h  hours      whiles lt 0              s  60         m           whilem lt 0              m  60         h           whileh lt 0              h  h  24           seconds  s  60     minutes  m  s60  60     hours  h  m60  s3600  24   istreamamp operator gtgtistreamamp ins, Timeamp t1      ins gtgt t1.hours     ins gtgt t1.minutes     ins gtgt t1.seconds      t1.normalize      return ins  ostreamamp operator ltltostreamamp out, Timeamp t1      ift1.hours lt 10         out ltlt 0 ltlt t1.hours ltlt      else         out ltlt t1.hours ltlt      ift1.minutes lt 10         out ltlt 0 ltlt t1.minutes ltlt      else         out ltlt t1.minutes ltlt      ift1.seconds lt 10         out ltlt 0 ltlt t1.seconds     else         out ltlt t1.seconds      return out   int main      Time t1, t2, t3, t4     cin gtgt t1     cin gtgt t2     cin gtgt t3      cout ltlt Time1  ltlt t1 ltlt endl     cout ltlt Time2  ltlt t2 ltlt endl     cout ltlt Time3  ltlt t3 ltlt endl      t4  t1  t2     cout ltlt Time4  ltlt t4 ltlt endl      t1  t3  t4     cout ltlt Time1  ltlt t1 ltlt endl      if t1 lt t3         cout ltlt Time1 lt Time3 ltlt endl     else         cout ltlt Time3 gt Time1 ltlt endl      Time t5  t2  Time0,0,1     if t5 lt t2         cout ltlt Time5 lt Time2 ltlt endl     else         cout ltlt Time5 gt Time2 ltlt endl      cout ltlt Almost midnight  ltlt Time0,0,0  Time0,0,1 ltlt endl      return 0   Time operator  const Timeamp t1, const Timeamp t2      Time temp     temp.hours  t1.hours  t2.hours     temp.minutes  t1.minutes  t2.minutes     temp.seconds  t1.seconds  t2.seconds      return temp   Time operator  const Timeamp t1, const Timeamp t2      Time temp      temp.hours  t1.hours  t2.hours     temp.minutes  t1.minutes  t2.minutes     temp.seconds  t1.seconds  t2.seconds      temp.normalize      return temp   bool operator lt const Timeamp t1, const Timeamp t2      ift1.hours lt t2.hours ampamp t1.minutes lt t2.minutes ampamp t1.seconds lt t2.seconds         return true     else         return false  codepre  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 8 pI am working on a problem that involves taking fractional powers of particular matrices.p  pFor the matrix A with 2 on the main diagonal and 1 on the sub and super diagonal the finite difference matrix for the Dirichlet Laplacian in 1D, there was basically no difference between using MATLABs codesqrtmAcode function and diagonalizing the matrix codeA  VDVcode and computing codeVD12Vcode even if the matrix was as large as 1000x1000. This made me think I could compute other fractional powers codeVD1nVcode that MATLAB does not have built in functions for.p  pHowever when I consider the matrix A for the Dirichlet Laplacian in 2D, there is a significant difference between MATLABs sqrtm function and the diagonalization procedure I used above even if the matrix was as small as 100x100. In particular, MATLABs sqrtm function is better and my results dont make any sense if I do it the other way.p  pI am wondering if anyone can explain why this happens and if there is a way to fix it so that I can compute fractional powers of a large matrix in MATLAB.p  pstrongEdit I made a big mistake since codeA  VDVcode, not codeVDVcode as I wrote above and in my code.

Negative 8 pFor context, Im trying to handle mouse events on instances of codeCollectioncode from codematplotlibcode. codematplotlibcode handles the mouse events too, the problem is that Im doing this from codenetworkxcode, which uses codematplotlib.pyplot.scattercode to plot nodes on a graph. Im not modifying codematplotlibcode itself, because I dont think these features would be useful to codematplotlibcode.p  pI also want to be able to pick and choose which events are handled and allow users to choose what happens when a mouse event is detected. So, for example, if I want something to be draggable, I would allow it to handle mouse click, motion and unclick events. However, if I want it to just give me information about a node, it just needs to handle the mouse click event.p  pcodematplotlibcode does have an example a hrefhttpmatplotlib.orguserseventhandling.htmldraggablerectangleexercise relnofollowherea, where they wrap the instance in a codeDraggablecode class, connect to the mouse events and have functions to handle behaviour. In my case, I wouldnt know which events I would want to handle or I might not implement the callback functions for each event.p  pAs I see it at the moment, one option is to create methods that could be bound to the instancep  pre classlangpython prettyprintoverridecodeimport types import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  def onclickself, mouseclickevent     callback on click event, mouseclickevent is passed     automatically by mplconnect     pass  nodecollection  plt.scatter...

Negative 8 pHow would I get the ip address of a mongo container and set it as environmental variable when creating a node imagep  pIve been running into an issue with conflicting tech stacks keystone.js, forever, and docker.

Command would be codeforever keystone.jscode. There is an issue with this in that the docker container drops immediatly. If I start the app with a simple codeforever startcode rather than going to the script the app starts up fine but the env variable needed is not set. Its hard coded in the docker image but of course this is not a good solution as the ip of the mongodb may change in the future and then on the node container restart it would not be able to find the db. See a couple of possibilitiesp  ol lipSwitch to just using a node keystone.js, would loose the functionality of the forever start which will restart the app if there is a critical failure.

Negative 8 pI love Lens library and I love how it works, but sometimes it introduces so many problems, that I regret I ever started using it. Lets look at this simple examplep  precode LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell   import Control.Lens  data Data  A  x  String, y  String             B  x  String   makeLenses Data  main  do     let b  B x         print  view y b codepre  pit outputsp  precode codepre  pAnd now imagine  weve got a datatype and we refactor it  by changing some names. Instead of getting error in runtime, like with normal accessors that this name does not longer apply to particular data constructor, lenses use codememptycode from codeMonoidcode to create default object, so we get strange results instead of error. Debugging something like this is almost impossible. Is there any way to fix this behaviour I know there are some special operators to get the behaviour I want, but all normal looking functions from lenses are just horrible. Should I just override them with my custom module or is there any nicer methodp  pAs a sidenote I want to be able to read and set the arguments using lens syntax, but just remove the behaviour of automatic result creating when field is missing.p
Negative 8 pUsing the codecherecode command at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9637601opencygwinataspecificfolderthis linka I was able to add the open bash terminal here to my windows shell.p  pHowever, it looks like rather than opening in a regular cygwin shell it opens in a cmd prompt thats running cygwin. I am unable to maximize cygwin fully.

Negative 8 pI am using Umbraco 7.1 and I have a custom Membership Provider, which I set up following various different tutorials and blog posts. For the most part it is working well, but there are a couple of things I dont understandp  pMy custom Membership Provider inherits from codeSystem.Web.Security.MembershipProvidercode the majority of tutorials I have read say it should inherit from codeUmbraco.Web.Security.Providers.MembersMembershipProvidercode but when I change it to inherit from that, the methods I have overridden are no longer hit, for example if I put a break point on codeValidateUserstring username, string passwordcode it will not get hit when I attempt to login. Can someone please explain which class I should inherit from and why That would be awesome.p  pSecondly, I have overridden codeGetAllUsersint pageIndex, int pageSize, out int totalRecordscode so when I login to the back office and go to Members, I can see a list of all of the people who have registered on the site. But when I click on a member to view their details, the codeGetUserobject providerUserKey, bool userIsOnlinecode method gets hit, but the providerUserKey is always codenullcode. In the table my Members are saved in, I have a column for the ProviderUserKey, I have tried setting it as a UniqueIdentifier and as a string, with the same result. So if someone could tell me how to view Member details in the back office with a custom Membership Provider, I would appreciate it. I am assuming this is possible, but I could well be wrong. p  pAny help at all greatly appreciated.p

Negative 8 pI have a global ExceptionHandler in my web api 2.0, which handles all unhandled exceptions in order to return a friendly error message to the api caller.

Negative 8 pWe write many PySide scripts for Maya 2015, and we save the settings using codeQSettingscode.  Normally we create the codeQSettingscode object in our readSettings and writeSettings functions.  Today I tried making the codeQSettingscode object a class variable.

Negative 8 pwas writing an MVC application over the weekend and decided that part of the application should use WebAPI, i had the following javascript which calls a simple MVC Controller actionp  precode    .postAppTestDb, request, function data          if data.status  SUCCESS              alertdata.msg             installBtn.removeAttrdisabled          else              alertdata.msg              , json codepre  pWhen this returns the value codedatacode is represented as a JSON object. When i ported my code over to WebAPI the result in codedatacode was a string i.e. codestatusSUCCESS,msgTestcodep  pThe MVC controller method below removed other code to keep example simplep  precodepublic string TestDbstring appDb, string appUsername, string appPassword, string appHost              return JsonConvert.SerializeObjectnew  status  SUCCESS, msg  Test       codepre  pAnd the WebAPI controller method belowp  precode[HttpPost] public string TestDb[FromBody] TestDbDTO testDb              return JsonConvert.SerializeObjectnew  status  SUCCESS, msg  Test       codepre  pAs you can see from the above examples, both methods return exactly the same result.

Negative 8 pAfter upgrading to Ionic version 1.0.0beta.14, my dynamically generated images no longer render. The image links are pulled in from a http.get call. Ive output the results to the console and the link is present. This only occurs in the build, when viewing the files on the web or in Ionic Lab, they appear just fine.

For example, if I do want to edit the People controller, I have to press the shift key before I even start to type the name of the class.

Negative 8 pI am a Java API Developer trying to integrate with iOS Passbook App. I had created a PKPass bundle with Pass.json and other necessary resources. I could view the created pass in both Safari, Passbook mobile app.p  pCurrently I am trying to update the Passes. I have exposed a service for registering the device through which I can capture devicepush token, device library identifier, pass identifier. p  pWhen I try to update the pass, I am using APNS to create the Pull request from the device. I have exposed a service for Getting the Serial Numbers for Passes Associated with a Device and I could send the pass serial number and last updated back to the device.p  pThen the device hits my Getting the Latest Version of a Pass service and I am creating a new PKPass bundle. I am storing the new pkpass bundle in the server and have the bundle as a byte array in the service. I have to send back the pkpass bundle back to the device which I couldnt. I have the following queries regarding that.p  ol liI have created the new pass with same serial number and authentication token as the old one. Please correct me, if I am wrong.li liI am trying to send the whole pkpass bundle with Pass.json, icon images, manifest.json and signature. Please correct me, if I am wrong.li liWhat is the way to send back the latest version As byte array or any other wayli liI have exposed a service for logging errors but I couldnt see any error logs as well.li ol  pSimply I couldnt cross finish line in the update and everything else is working as expected till the response that I have to send for Getting the latest version of the pass. p  pSo from Java perspective, I need a Restful response entity for sending the latest version of PKPass. p  pPlease provide some sample Java codes, if possible.p  pEDITp  pActually I have added the following headers.p  pContentDisposition formdata name409eedb9bf2e436dbb2bfed3c6630c66 filename409eedb9bf2e436dbb2bfed3c6630c66.pkpass  CacheControl mustrevalidate, postcheck0, precheck0  ContentType applicationvnd.apple.pkpass  ContentLength 28996  Date Fri, 17 Apr 2015 163251 GMTp

Negative 8 pI am creating basically a shopping cart app and I am trying to populate a listView with images of the items. So currently everything else is displayed just fine like the size, store, description, price, etc. All this information is being retrieved from my existing database and put into the listView. For the images, I have put the names of the images into a column in my database called ID and I have put the actual images into my drawable folder. To make the images show up with their respective item, I am using the getResources method, but for some reason, it isnt working, it wont show the image. I have posted the code below, and youll see the getResources method in my ListItemAdapter.java. If someone could figure this out and fix it, that would be great.p  pstrongDatabaseHelper.javastrongp  precodepackage ankitkaushal.app.healthysizing  import android.content.Context import

Negative 8 pSuppose you want to make a plot of regression coefficients where interactions are both grouped and renamed.

Negative 8 pI have a listview on my mainactivity that is showing items from a database. I have an add button up in the action bar. When the add button is clicked on a dialog pops up and the user fills out fields for the new item and then they click add and it adds the item to the database. The only problem is that the listview on the mainactivity doesnt update to show the new item. I can close the app and reopen it and I see the new item. It just doesnt update immediatly. Same problem with deleting an item, only the delete happens onLongPressp  pstrongMainactivity.javastrongp  precodepackage blah.blah.blah  import android.app.AlertDialog import android.app.Dialog import android.app.DialogFragment import android.content.ContentValues import android.content.DialogInterface import android.database.Cursor import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase import android.os.Bundle import android.support.v4.app.Fragment import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity import android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager import android.support.v4.app.FragmentPagerAdapter import android.support.v4.view.ViewPager import android.util.Log import android.view.ContextMenu import android.view.ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup import android.widget.AdapterView import android.widget.ArrayAdapter import android.widget.EditText import android.widget.ListView import android.widget.Spinner import android.widget.TextView  public class InitActivity extends FragmentActivity       SectionsPagerAdapter mSectionsPagerAdapter      ViewPager mViewPager      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState           Gets the data repository in write mode         PlayersDBHelper mDbHelper  new PlayersDBHelpergetBaseContext         SQLiteDatabase db  mDbHelper.getWritableDatabase           super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activityinit           Create the adapter that will return a fragment for each of the three          primary sections of the app.         mSectionsPagerAdapter  new SectionsPagerAdapter                 getSupportFragmentManager           Set up the ViewPager with the sections adapter.         mViewPager  ViewPager findViewByIdR.id.pager         mViewPager.setAdaptermSectionsPagerAdapter      End onCreate      Override     public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu           Inflate the menu this adds items to the action bar if it is present.         getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.init, menu         return true           Override     public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item           Handle presses on the action bar items         switch item.getItemId              case R.id.actionadd                 showAddPlayerDialog                 return true             default                 return super.onOptionsItemSelecteditem                    public void showAddPlayerDialog           Create an instance of the dialog fragment and show it         DialogFragment dialog  new addPlayerDialog         dialog.showthis.getFragmentManager, addPlayerFragment           public class SectionsPagerAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter           public SectionsPagerAdapterFragmentManager fm              superfm                   Override         public Fragment getItemint position               ifposition  0                  Fragment playersFragment  new PlayersFragment                 return playersFragment              else ifposition  1                 Fragment otherFragment new otherFragment                 return otherFragment              else                  Fragment otherFragment2  new otherFragment2                 return otherFragment2                                 Override         public int getCount               Show 3 total pages.             return 3                   Override         public CharSequence getPageTitleint position              Locale l  Locale.getDefault             switch position              case 0                 return getStringR.string.titlesection1.toUpperCasel             case 1                 return getStringR.string.titlesection2.toUpperCasel             case 2                 return getStringR.string.titlesection3.toUpperCasel                          return null              End sectionsPagerAdapter       public static class PlayersFragment extends Fragment           public static final String ARGSECTIONNUMBER  sectionnumber         public int myFragmentId  1         private ListView mylistview         private String[] values          public ArrayAdapterltStringgt adapter            public PlayersFragment                    Override         public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,                 Bundle savedInstanceState               View rootView  inflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentplayers,                     container, false             mylistview  ListView rootView.findViewByIdR.id.myListView              registerForContextMenumylistview              PlayersDBHelper mDbHelper  new PlayersDBHelperrootView.getContext             SQLiteDatabase db  mDbHelper.getReadableDatabase               Define a projection that specifies which columns from the database              you will actually use after this query.

Negative 8 pI am creating a VBA tool to record for QA purposes revisions of translated files.p  pI can read both original and revised text, whitch I do paragraph by paragraph.p  pBut I run into problems every time the file cannot be written to open by someone else or wasnt closed correctly.p  pSince the macro will run for a long time, this is an issue. I could work around it, but my client probably will not be able to follow the procedure.p  pIs there no way to just read the original text without having to modify the filep  pIt really feels that there should be a way.

Negative 8 pIs it possible to determine whether or not a javascript function is pure, using javascriptp  blockquote   pA function is said to be strongpurestrong when it behaves in a predictable way, in the sense that for each x, the function will always return the same associated y value i.e a singlevalued map.p blockquote  pFor example, a pure functionp  precodefunction purex    return x  x  codepre  pAnd impurep  precodevar x  0 function impurey    x  x  y   return x  codepre  pWhile its easy to tell here that codeimpure0  impure0code, it isnt as apparent with a function such asp  precodefunction weirdx    if x  specificThing      return false    else      return true     codepre  porp  precodevar count  0 function surprisex    count   if count  10e10 ampamp x  0      return true    else      return false     codepre  pAnother way of asking this is, is it possible to determine whether or not a javascript function is impure, using javascriptp  pTheoretically it may be possible or impossible, but practically what steps can one take to start to determine this, maybe given a set of constraints or assumptionsp  pAnother definition of purity includes the caveat that nonlocal variables may not be changed, but Id like to consider that a separate problem.

Negative 8 pI know inheritance means is a relationship, and it can also have polymorphic behaviour. But for example, in Java, the difference between extending from a parent class and implementing an interface is that the interface has methods to be implemented only. They both need the child class to depend on the parent class and lead class to couple to each other.p  pSo, besides extending from parent class, should implementing interfaces to a class also be avoided if possiblep

Negative 8 pIve been reading quite some articles on the asyncawait programming model, still there are some things which are not very clear, and I would like to share my perplexities around those.p  pSay we have the following configurationp  pThe main, async, method is codepublic async Taskltboolgt DoSomethingBigAsync...code which internally has 3 other methods called as followsp  pA codevar a  await someInstance.DoSomethingLittleAAsync.ConfigureAwaitfalsecode br B codevar b  await someInstance.DoSomethingLittleBAsynccode br C codevar c  someInstance.DoSomethingLittleCcodep  pThe main method is called, say, from a UI thread. We know that the context will be captured and when the main method completes the context will be restored.p  pIf Im not wrong, when the first strongAstrong async method is called, due to the codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode the UI context is not captured and the continuation is instead pushed to a thread from the pool. But this is not guaranteed to happen, because the call may complete immediately. For this reason, I suspect, that codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode should be called on all the inner async methods strongAstrong and strongBstrong in this case. Is this correct, or the runtime knows what to do after it sees the first call to codeConfigureAwaitfalsecodep  pMy other concern is about two bad practices or considered so and their side effects.p  pOne bad practice seems to be, as per Stephen Toubs article p  blockquote   pexposing asynchronous wrappers for synchronous methods in a library   is badp blockquote  pFor this reason it wouldnt be a good idea to make an async version of the codeDoSomethingLittleCcode method.p  pThe other bad practice seems to be p  blockquote   pDont mix blocking and async code.p blockquote  pNow, looking at the code above, if the first codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode would guarantee that continuation is pushed to the thread pool I would see no added value in using codeTask.StartNew gt  c  someInstance.DoSomethingLittleC code. If, on the other side, codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode never guarantees that continuation is pushed to the thread pool, then we might have problem and we would have to make sure we use codeTask.StartNew gt  c  someInstance.DoSomethingLittleC code.p  pWRONGbr A codevar a  await someInstance.DoSomethingLittleAAsync.ConfigureAwaitfalsecodebr B codevar b  await someInstance.DoSomethingLittleBAsynccodebr C codevar c  someInstance.DoSomethingLittleCcodebrp  pCORRECTbr A codevar a  await someInstance.DoSomethingLittleAAsync.ConfigureAwaitfalsecodebr B codevar b  await someInstance.DoSomethingLittleBAsync.ConfigureAwaitfalsecodebr C codevar c  Task.StartNew gt return someInstance.DoSomethingLittleCcodep

An OpenCL program consists of kernels. Each kernel can be called enqueued from   the host part of an application.   First create a kernel to call it from the existing program.

Negative 8 pI am having a problem with my web user control WUC.  Whenever the page tries to it load, the browser gets a javascript error ReferenceError  is not defined.  This is occurring because my WUC is trying to execute some jquery before my scriptmanager on my master page is referenced.p  pFirst, my WUC is a menu bar that every web page will have.  I am actually referencing a dll file to create my user control, which it seems to use jquery to build the menu bar.  In order for the jquery to work, it needs to reference jquery1.11.3.  Now, as I mentioned, I have a master page that has a scriptmanager, and I am properly referencing jquery1.11.3 in it.  Also, just to clarify, my scriptmanager is the first tag in my form tag.p  pNow, the only way I can seem to get my WUC to load properly is by referencing jquery1.11.3 in the header contentplaceholder for each page specifically.  This is very redundant, and something I want to avoid.  Does anyone know how to solve this issuep

Negative 8 pIm trying to write custom serialization for an object in jackson and there seem to be many options, Im wondering if one is generally preferred over the others.p  pIve read about codeJsonSerializableWithTypecode, and its deprecated sibling codeJsonSerializablecode. This seems good, since it doesnt require users of the class to register codeModulecodes in their codeObjectMappercodes. However I cant seem to resolve codeJsonSerializableWithTypecode or find any examples of its usage. The fasterxml page that talks about it seems dated as well.p  pThe other option seems to be external serialization with codeJsonSerializercodes. Ive read about codeJsonSerializecode, but cant tell if its betterworseoldernewer than codeJsonSerializablecode.p  pIs there a compelling argument for either one of those over the other Or is registering a codeModulecode to an codeObjectMappercode the most accepted wayp

Negative 8 pI have a codetimezonecode attribute on my codeUsercode model which tracks the users preferred timezone. This starts off as codenilcode by default.p  pOn their personal EDIT page, the user can change their timezone by selecting another one from a dropdown list.p  pMy test is as follows  p  precodeit updates the users time zone on submit do    Creates with FactoryGirl   user  createuser     BEFORE state confirmation   expectuser.timezone.to benil     Simulate the user selecting a timezone from the dropdown on their edit page.     Capybara is used for selection and clicking.   visit editprofilepath   selecttimezonefromdropdownAmericaNewYork     Submit, which sends a POST request to update the User model   clickbuttonSubmit     AFTER state confirmation  this FAILS    Apparently the reload doesnt work and timezone is still set to    nil for this user    user.reload   expectuser.timezone.to eqAmericaNewYork end codepre  pAs you can see, the test fails because the codetimezonecode is never updated for this User record.p  pHeres whats strange p  ol lipIn the database, the value correctly DOES change. Its just the codeActiveRecordcode object which doesntpli lipTo get around 1, I tried reloading the object attributes, but no luckpli lipIf I pause it with codebinding.prycode just after the codereloadcode and run codeuser.reloadcode strongmanuallystrong, it works. So its just while running during the test suite that its not working.pli ol  pIs there something strange going on here with how the value is cached and reloadedp  pThanksp
