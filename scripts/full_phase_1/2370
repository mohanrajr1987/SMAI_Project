Lets say the possible values for the sentiment are a,b,c,d,e. So in part one of my data, i will have all the reviews, but the reviews that have sentiment a will be marked as positive and all of the others will be marked as negative. Similarly i create other parts for the other sentiment values.pli lipClean up the data in all 5 partspli lipCreate a pipeline and feed all the test set parts to my classifier, one after the other. I will store one result per part. So result of classifying part one is partOneRes and so on. Anything which is marked as positive in partOneRes belongs to sentiment a. Similarly for other parts.pli lipFinally i would like to combine the results for all 5 parts. I will look at partOneRes. Anything that is marked positive will be changed to Sentiment a. I will do similarly for all the other parts. Then i simply merge the results.pli lipIt would have been ideal if i got no overlaps or duplicates. But i get a small number of duplicates, which is fine. I can add some logic to handle that.pli lipI would do this for all three classifiers and finally i want to find out which classifier give me the best results.pli ol  pMy problem is that I can see that there are many reviews which my classifier was not able to put in any category Why would this happen Could it be due to the small size of the datasetp
Positive 2370 pi would like to get the base form of a word using Stanford in java.p  ppublic class baseForm p  precodeprotected StanfordCoreNLP pipeline      public baseForm           Create StanfordCoreNLP object properties, with POS tagging          required for lemmatization, and lemmatization         Properties props         props  new Properties         props.putannotators, tokenize, ssplit, pos, lemma                     This is a pipeline that takes in a string and returns various analyzed linguistic forms.            The String is tokenized via a tokenizer such as PTBTokenizerAnnotator,            and then other sequence model style annotation can be used to add things like lemmas,            POS tags, and named entities. These are returned as a list of CoreLabels.            Other analysis components build and store parse trees, dependency graphs, etc.                       This class is designed to apply multiple Annotators to an Annotation.            The idea is that you first build up the pipeline by adding Annotators,            and then you take the objects you wish to annotate and pass them in and            get in return a fully annotated object.

Positive 2370 pIm using the Stanford classifier to perform a classification task on tokens in sentences, where each token has to be assigned to one semantic category. p  pEverything works well at training time, but I have the following problem. When, after training, I try to classify a new instance and this instance has a feature that is never seen in the training set, the classifier will output a score of 0.0 for all the labels, therefore returning always the first label in the list as best. In the specific case Im using the lemma of the word as a feature, doing like thisp  precodeLabel1    currentposNN currentlemmadog otherfeatureX ...

Negative 2370 pFirst, this question is assuming that there is a working method for interacting with a Mail Server in this fashion. If its not, please feel free to let me know. Second, Im relatively new to working with Mail Servers, so any related reading materials would be greatly appreciated.p  hr  pIm working on a project that allows the creation of online stores using toplevel domains. The solution is rather robust and Im happy with how its come out. However, the need has come to allow users who use toplevel domain names for their stores to also host their email with us. The solution has a built in messaging center that Id like to utilize, which is currently using MySQL for message storage similar to the messaging systems on various social networking sites. Ive been reading on working with POP in PHP, and integrating in that way shouldnt be an issue. However, Im running into a wall when it comes to the actual mail account creation and management, as there seems to be little to no accessible on the web learning material on the subject.p  pIn my ideal situation, upon a new user registration, Id like to use the username and password that theyve chosen as their account access credentials to setup a default user on the mailserver, and provide an interface within the solution to add, remove, and modify users on the mail server, which I would then access via a POP mail applicationinterface.p  pHeres what Im working with Im hosting with MT, running QMail, PHP 5.2, MySQL 4, and Apache on a Linux server. I have shell access root, and can modify any necessary root files. Also, Im allowing users to point domains to their stores via ARecords as well as by NS records. Im assuming that Ill need to ask them to point their domains MX records to my mailserver address in order for this to workp  pWhat Im looking for is a place to start looking and learning. Reading materials, tutorials, casestudies, etc. Whatever you can send over to help me get closer to my goal. Also, if the method Ive described above is flawed, or you can recommend a better method, Id be willing to hear your thoughts on that as well.p  pFeel free to use this thread as an open discussion on the topic as well though, Id like answers and suggestions to be a first priority.p

Negative 2370 pI am trying to identify the right tool, language, software package, or other for the automated development of presentations, where the presentation is user interactive.p  pThe presentation will consist of images with titles and some descriptive text. Most of the time there will be 3570 images. I would like to show each image on a separate page, slide, tab, etc. I guess proper terminology depends on the solution.p  pThe images will change, but the titles will remain the same, and there will be a little bit of change to the description of each image.  p  pAfter putting the presentation together, I would like the user to be able to circle and write on the electronic image in kind of the wax pencil sense I previously worked in a photo lab and we worked with wax pencils on negatives all the time and would like to have kind of a similar flexibility.  Moreover, I would like users to be able to add comments as well, kind of in the way Adobe PDF Professional allows, e.g. inserting bubble comments, etc. p  pMost importantly, I would like to be able to do this in an automated way. Right now we are using PowerPoint, but the amount of time it is taking to put an image on a slide in PowerPoint, resize it, and then set up the text is killing us. Plus, as the images change it takes tons of time to go back and update them. Thus, we would like something that is a bit faster to update images and get the feedback from our few users. Does not necessarily have to be a web hosted solution, but could be run through a browser.  p  pSorry this is so long and thanks for any ideas and feedback, especially if there is an existing software package solution, language that can be used, or other approach to get this done.p

Negative 2370 pI have read a lot about the Java class loading process lately. Often I came across texts that claimed that it is not possible to add classes to the classpath during runtime and load them without class loader hackery URLClassLoaders etc.p  pAs far as I know classes are loaded dynamically. That means their bytecode representation is only loaded and transformed to a java.lang.Class object when needed.p  pSo shouldnt it be possible to add a JAR or .class file to the classpath after the JVM started and load those classes, provided they havent been loaded yet  To be clear In this case the classpath is simply folder on the filesystem. Adding a JAR or .class file simply means dropping them in this folder.p  pAnd if not, does that mean that the classpath is searched on JVM startup and all fully qualified names of the found classes are cached in an internal listp  pIt would be nice of you if you could point me to some sources in your answers. Preferably the offical SUN documentation a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdocsbooksjvmssecondeditionhtmlVMSpecTOC.doc.htmlSun JVM Speca. I have read the spec but could not find anything about the classpath and if its finalized on JVM startup.p  pP.s.p  pThis is a theoretical question. I just want to know if it is possible. There is nothing practical I want to achieve. There is just my thirst for knowledge p

Negative 2370 pI am wondering about the benefits of having the stringtype immutable from the programmers pointofview.p  pTechnical benefits on the compilerlanguage side can be summarized mostly that it is easier to do optimisations if the type is immutable. Read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2916358immutablestringsvsstdstringherea for a related question.p  pAlso, in a mutable string type, either you have threadsafety already builtin then again, optimisations are harder to do or you have to do it yourself. You will have in any case the choice to use a mutable string type with builtin thread safety, so that is not really an advantage of immutable stringtypes. Again, it will be easier to do the handling and optimisations to ensure threadsafety on the immutable type but that is not the point here.p  pBut what are the benefits of immutable stringtypes in the usage What is the point of having some types immutable and others not That seems very inconsistent to me.p  pIn C, if I want to have some string to be immutable, I am passing it as const reference to a function codeconst stdstringampcode. If I want to have a changeable copy of the original string, I am passing it as codestdstringcode. Only if I want to have it mutable, I am passing it as reference codestdstringampcode. So I just have the choice about what I want to do. I can just do this with every possible type.p  pIn Python or in Java, some types are immutable mostly all primitive types and strings, others are not.p  pIn pure functional languages like Haskell, everything is immutable.p  pIs there a good reason why it make sense to have this inconsistency Or is it just purely for technical lower level reasonsp

Negative 2370 pSo I have created a model in Ogre3D and this model is made up of a number of triangles of arbitrary rotation and position. I would like to unwrap the model like many modelling programs do so that all of the triangles are mapped to 2d x,y but the triangle sizes are maintained. This is for applying decals. The reason the triangle sizes must be maintained so that when the texture is applied there isnt any stretching.p  pThis was the direction I was thinking of going in but I am having trouble visualizing it and achieving the correct algorithmsp  precodeVerticies will have a converted bool  func triangle x      for each of xs vertices            map to x,y coordinates if not converted            check other triangles for common vertex if so call funccommontri codepre  pOnce this returns there will be a converted version of all of the triangles so that they are all unwrapped and placeable on the texture, where I am having trouble is the mapping to x,y space. Im not sure how to get a triangle in 3d space to 2d space so that it maintains all of its attributes like going from an angled view to a perpedicular view of the surface Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 2370 pIm developing a plugin for a bigger app and I encountered a strange problem with the following code. When run in Release mode or in Debug with no breakpoints everything is fine. But when I put a breakpoint somewhere near the snippet below I get an error. It looks like debugger preevaluates the code inside the if blocks causing an error altough this code is never actually reached. p  pPlease note that the indexer internally checks for incorrect indexes and fires an event way up to the main application. The main app handles this error event by showing a dialog box and closing itself. I cant change the main app and I cant modify the indexer altough I think throwing an exception instead of firing an event could work.p  precodeint a  GetA  returns 0 if a  1     manager[a  1][ColumnName.Name]  X Manager has an indexer returning a DataRow.   if a  2     manager[a  1][ColumnName.Name]  Y  codepre  pWhen I disabled the Enable property evaluation and other implicit function calls in ToolsOptionsDebugging it worked perfectly. Do you have any ideas how to workaround this I dont want this error messages but I also dont want to lose the debugger evaluation convenience.p  p[EDIT] I rewrote the description. p  pstrong[UPDATE]strong I temporarily changed the code inside the indexer to throw an exception insted of delegating an event to the upper errorhandling layer and it helped. VS debugger swallowed the exception so all side effects stopped no message boxes were displayed by the error handling layerp  pSo the question isp  pIs there a third option besidep  p1 Permanently changing from an event being poppedup to upper layer to an exceptionp  p2 Unchecking Enable property evaluation and other implicit function callsp

Negative 2370 pI have a Jtree with nodes representing images that the user can call up and view.   Sometimes it takes the images up to four or five seconds to load.    Ideally, I would like wait cursor to show while the user is waiting and the node selected in the tree to be selected.   However, what Im find is that the user clicks on the node, nothing appears to happen and then the image appears and then the node is selected the wait cursor never appears or more likely appears very briefly and then disappears immediately.

Negative 2370 pIm implementing a CMS site in Django, and Id like to add fulltext content search.  The site is reasonably small and will generate low search traffic, so I think Whoosh will be a reasonable production solution.p  pMy current understanding is that the Whoosh indexing and result generation happens in the application process, rather than requiring its own daemon, which is great.  However, Im a bit worried about concurrent access to the index.

Negative 2370 pi put data in, but no mdf file is created. No database is created.. Why is thatp  pAn extract from the book that i have read nowp  blockquote   pAt this point, the CreateUserWizard control uses the ASP.NET Membership class behind the scenes to create a new user. The default membership provider creates the aspnetdb.mdf file if it doesnt exist already and then adds the new user record. Once this process is complete, the CreateUserWizard control shows a message informing you that the user was created. Miraculously, all of this takes place automatically even though you havent configured anything in the web.config file and you didnt create the database file in advance. p blockquote

Negative 2370 pI hate even bringing this up bc there are so many hundreds of pages talking about this error dating back 78  years...  However, I cant quite figure this out.p  pI have a report service running on server A which connects to SQL Server 2008 R2 on Server B.  Both servers are running Windows Server 2008.  The report service is multithreaded and runs up to 10 reports at a time each on its own thread.br My connection string is as followsp  precodeData SourceServerBInitial CatalogDBNametrustedconnectionYESConnection Timeout0Max Pool Size500 codepre  pAs you see, I have set the connect timeout to 0 to wait for a connection until its available, and max pool size to 500 bc I wanted to make sure the pool was not too small for my multithreaded service.  The error typically only shows up when the service starts and there is a queue of reports waiting to be processed.p  pSo obviously, the first thing to do is look for leaking connections..  there have to be connections that are not being closed that are causing the pool to fill up, right  Nope looks like the pool never fills up.p  pI have spent the last several hours running Performance Monitor on the server watching .NET Data Provider for SqlServer and the NumberOfPooledConnections never gets above 20 or  so.  I also have perfmon running on the SQL server watching SQLServerGeneral Statistics and UserConnections never goes above 50.  During this time, I have caused this error to be reported 2 or 3 times by manually restarting the service.p  pWhat else can I look for  What else would cause this error Full error message isp  precodeSystem.InvalidOperationException Timeout expired. The timeout period elapsed prior to obtaining a connection from the pool.

Negative 2370 pI have a Silverlight 4 app that calls a number of WCF methods.  Ive got two general types of tests I can run in Visual Studio one is a console app that calls the methods synchronously, and the other is the Silverlight app where Im calling them asynchronously.  Both testing methods work I get data back from my service.p  pWhat Im doing then is to launch my app via a custom ECB menu item in SharePoint this brings up a modal dialog where my Silverlight object tag is hosted inside an HTML page the Silverlight app displays correctly I can even pass query string parameters in from SharePoint and those are displaying correctly.  Thus the app is running inside the modal dialog as I expect.p  pBut, in the context of SharePoint, none of the WCF calls are working.  I get an exception which is an exception occurred during the operation, making the result invalid.  Ive tried this with endpoints such asp  pa hrefhttplocalhost19261MyService.svc relnofollowhttplocalhost19261MyService.svcap  pa hrefhttpsomething.devvtibinsomething.WCFMyService.svc relnofollowhttpsomething.devvtibinsomething.WCFMyService.svcap  pThese endpoints work when I test from Visual Studio, again, both synchronously and async.  p  pIt obviously seems like some security or authentication issue when I try the endpoints other than localhost, I do get a credentials prompt, and although I have administrative privileges in SharePoint and on the box, entering the credentials doesnt help the service call still fails.p  pAny ideas out there  Many thanks Davep

Negative 2370 pI have a JSP page, where some parts of the pages are loaded from the backend using AJAX. For example, when I first open the page, the URL is a hrefhttpwww.madeupdomainnamebecauseofstackoverflowrestrictions.comlistUsers.do relnofollowhttpwww.madeupdomainnamebecauseofstackoverflowrestrictions.comlistUsers.doa. The page contains an add user button, which loads HTML content containing a form etc. from the backend to the divelement with id addArea. The URL stays the same the whole time naturally, as the request is done in the background.p  pThe problem I have is that the content loaded using AJAX is not completely viewable with any means. p  pUsing Firefox I can see the new HTML with the Firebug addon and Inspect element, but the content within the scripttags is not visible that way also not in the Script tab in Firebug  only the originally loaded scripts appear there. If I use View page source in FF a page reload is executed and I dont see the newly generated content I only see the content of page a hrefhttpwww.madeupdomainnamebecauseofstackoverflowrestrictions.comlistUsers.do relnofollowhttpwww.madeupdomainnamebecauseofstackoverflowrestrictions.comlistUsers.doa as it was when first loaded.p  pWith Chrome I have the same problem as with Firefox.p  pUsing IE I see only the original source.p  pOf course I can work around this by adding debugging mechanisms to the JS code and working halfblind, or moving parts of the JS code to external files etc., but if by any means possible, I would prefer to just view the code loaded using AJAX.

Negative 2370 pIm using the following script to generate a horizontal drop down menu on a site. It works wonderfully in Firefox and Safari, but fails in IE8 surprise surprise. The intended behavior is that when a main menu item with a submenu is hovered over in the navigation list, the corresponding submenu will appear and any existing submenus in the .submenu div will disappear. In IE8, though, only one of the menu items will display its corresponding submenu and then only after the link to the left of it, a link without a submenu, has been hovered, and its doing so disables the CSS hover effect on the links. a hrefhttpwww.qualprnt.comclientsfbcw relnofollowHeresa a live example.p  pIm not experienced enough in jQuery to know why I might be running into issues, so Im asking the good folks at StackOverflow for help.

Negative 2370 pI am using C with a data repeater tied to a table adapter to pull a few columns from a table.  I have 3 FillBy clauses on my adapter, FillByFirstName, FillByLastName and FillByMRN Medical Record Number. These all three pull data from a table in SQL 2000 called Clients.p  pThe First Name QUERY looks like this and it works as desired p  precodeSELECT CLLName, CLFName, MEDRECNO, CLSEX, CLDOB, RACECode FROM dbo.Clients WHERE CLFName   ORDER BY CLLName, CLFName codepre  pThe Last Name QUERY looks like this and it too works as desiredp  precodeSELECT CLLName, CLFName, MEDRECNO, CLSEX, CLDOB, RACECode FROM dbo.Clients WHERE CLLName   ORDER BY CLLName, CLFName codepre  pThe MRN QUERY is where it fails and it is different because it utilizes the SQL LIKE statement.p  pAfter tons of searching online Ive found solutions that are touted as working but utterly fail for me.p  pFirstly solution I have failed with isp  pTable Adapater Queryp  precodeSELECT CLLName, CLFName, MEDRECNO, CLSEX, CLDOB, RACECode FROM dbo.Clients WHERE MEDRECNO LIKE  ORDER BY CLLName, CLFName codepre  pC codep  precodeclientsTableAdapter.FillByMRNclinicalSystemDataSet.Clients,   searchStr   codepre  pThis returns no error and no results.p  pWhen I trace it in SQL its executed like this Ive removed only the line breaks and some spacing.p  precodeexec spexecutesql NSELECT        CLLName, CLFName, MEDRECNO, CLSEX, CLDOB, RACECode FROM            dbo.Clients WHERE        MEDRECNO LIKE P1 ORDER BY CLLName, CLFName, NP1 char1024, 2222 codepre  pThe spacing I removed is... the 2222 in the last portion is padded out to 1024 characters.  I dont think this is at issue because the working methods without the like statement are padded as well.  IF this is at issue, I dont know how to change the behavior since the table adapter creates this query in cohort with SQL.p  pBI CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHY THE ABOVE METHOD FAILSB  Executing it directly in sql in this format returns an empty recordset with our without padding spaces.  There are 11 records in my table that return with this WORKING queryp  precodeSELECT  CLLName, CLFName, MEDRECNO, CLSEX, CLDOB, RACECode FROM dbo.Clients WHERE MEDRECNO LIKE 2222 ORDER BY CLLName, CLFName codepre  p...which is the above sql trace transformed into the actual statement without params and with the identical selection criteria.p  pThe second solution that fails for me is thisp  pTable Adapater Queryp  precodeSELECT CLLName, CLFName, MEDRECNO, CLSEX, CLDOB, RACECode FROM dbo.Clients WHERE MEDRECNO LIKE      ORDER BY CLLName, CLFName codepre  pWhile this does NOT work when calling the method from code, when editing the statement via the DataSet Designer, if I click the QUERY BUILDER and test it it prompts for the parameter it will return the desired set of records.p  pC portionp  precodeclientsTableAdapter.FillByMRNclinicalSystemDataSet.Clients, searchStr codepre  pThis returns NO results and a SQL trace showsp  precodeexec spexecutesql NSELECT CLLName, CLFName, MEDRECNO, CLSEX, CLDOB, RACECode FROM dbo.Clients WHERE MEDRECNO LIKE   P1   ORDER BY CLLName, CLFName, NP1 char1024, 2222 codepre  pAgain the 2222 is padded out to 1024 characters. But notice that the  in the sql is changed to .   The adapterSQL is fixing single quotes to double single quotes FOR me.p  pAdditionally Ive tried passing  without the single quotes but it only results in syntax errors in the table adapter.  Ive tried passing double quotes, with syntax errors as well..  and a few other miscellaneous this should fail, but why not type things.p  pIn almost every post one of these two ways is demonstrated to be a working way to do it, but I just cant make it work.p  pThere appears to be a disconnect in how the tableadapter should be presenting sql and how it actually is.. especially when the query builder shows success using the exact same statement that fails during runtime.p

Negative 2370 pI am making a billiards game, so my gravity is set to zero and I apply impulse to make a cue ball move.

The problem starts when they slowdown a lot and are about to stop but dont actually stop for like 45 seconds, and thats looks very unrealistic. p  pOne of the solutions that I thought was to check every frame the velocity of the ball and if its bellow some number i.e. when the ball is about to stop, make it zero to stop the object. The problem with this approach is that I am making a multiplayer game, where two players can have a slightly different frame rate and thus making two simulations of the same shot inconsistent.p  pCan anyone think of any other solutionp

Negative 2370 pI have an asynchronous function that checks for a few things and runs itself over and over using setTimeout and a queue.pop.

So I have a statement at some point like the followingp  precodeif isWhatIneedcurrentItem     completed  true    return  codepre  pIve got what I was looking for. The problem is that the queue has been fed more items since then and it keeps being executed asynchronously. So to remedy to this Ive added at the very top of that functionp  precodeif completed    console.logalready completed   return  codepre  pThis prevents each execution in the stack of calls from doing anything further especially not to pop more items from the queue and keep running.p  pMy question is, Ive read using multiple return statements esp. at the top of a function is poor practice. But in this case do you see another way this could be done I could wrap the whole body of my function with if completed  ...  but this strikes me as ugly also because it indents the whole body, the early return does not.p  pThanks, p

Negative 2370 pSometimes, VS wont let me do edit and continue, and it turns out its because my project codeEric.Controlscode has a reference to codeEric.Controlscode.

Negative 2370 pIm a beginning programmer, so I really dont know too much about IDEs or how they work.  Ive been wanting to migrate to the CodeBlocks IDE for a while now.  I wanted to test out a wxWidgets project, but in the process of setting one up, it asked me to select the location of wxWidgets, and said that it must be containing the common include and lib folders.  I then realized that there werent either of these folders located in the main CodeBlocks program folder.  Ive tried reinstalling it using the standard installation option, but to no avail the issue still stands.  Whats weird, however, is that simple console applications that include iostream or stdio.h do work with no errors.  Now, Im not really emdyingem to use wxWidgets, but this brings up the question strongemis this an installation error or a wxWidgets erroremstrongp

Negative 2370 pI have a VSIX extension that I created which shows up in Visual Studio 2010 and works as designed.p  pHowever I am attempting to build some Visual Studio automation which relies on this Extension and although its present in the project where I am building my automation package, when I run the package project, the visual studio experimental solution loads no problem, however when I look within the Extension Manager I do not see my registered Extension even though it shows up within my Visual Studio project where I am building my extension.p  pThe extension is a custom shell for LightSwitch which may be a clue as to why it is not showing within my experimental instance of Visual Studio, not sure as I see other extensions I built and registered for LightSwitch showing up.p  pOf course my issue is that when I attempt to load a solution that has a dependency on my LightSwitch extension, which otherwise loads fine outside of the Experimental Instance, fails due to the fact it cant locate my custom extension when I try to load the solution within my experimental solution.p

Negative 2370 pI am hosting a computing service on Ubuntu 12.04 and I need a method to prevent users from forkbombing. I am currently using codesetrlimitRLIMITNPROCcode in Linux. However, this actually sets a global limit on the number of processes for a given UID. Because my service has many parallel jobs, all running with the same UID, this means that one process can DOS the entire service.p  pInstead I am looking for a way to set a restriction on e.g. the recursive number of child procs for the current process.

This worked fine for years, but now the requirements changed Some stations need to synchronize their transportation more than it was necessary in the past. They need a task id in their transport commands, which must be the same for the outtransporting station and the intransporting station. The ID might be generated in codetransportOutcode, but the problem is how to carry the id the intransporting stationp  pI might simply extend the interface of codetransportIncode, but since only a small number of existing stations require this id it seems bloated and bad design to me. I wonder if there is a better way or how anyone would handle it if they were to design this from scratch.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2370 pThis question is probably borderline for stack overflow, so I apologize in advance if it seems overly offtopic. Im writing a program that involves many languages and Im in need of a table which maps emlanguagesem to Unicode points. Those of you familiar with Unicode will know that characters are divided up in blocks such as Latin, Cyrillic, etc. Of course, most languages which use Latin characters do not use emallem the Latin characters, and most languages which use Cyrillic characters do not use emallem the Cyrillic characters, etc. Im interested in a table that maps English only to those characters used in English, Spanish to only those characters used in Spanish, etc. Theres no need to cover every language in the world as this would be nearly impossible but at least some of the more common languages. Even then, this would be a fairly extensive table involving manytomany relationships. Im not sure that such a table exists. If it doesnt, I may turn this into an opensource project, as it would be very useful for me and possibly for others.p

Negative 2370 pI have created a program that subscribes to WPFs touch events. Everything has been working as expected over the last few months, but yesterday none of the touch events would fire. I tried creating a new, simple program to test touch events, but it works the same, all of the touch input gets sent as mouse events, even though the cursor changes from the mouse arrow to the touch crosshairs.p  pI restarted the computer several times and reinstalled the drivers but it did not seem to change anything. I have tried using a different brand of touch screen with different drives which also used to work and am seeing the exact same issue. Using the touch screens built in test tool, I can see that touch and multitouch are working as I expect and viewing the  Pen and Touch section of the System Properties confirms that the computer is recognizing the touch screen. p  pEDIT I continued to test the monitor and it appears that multitouch is working in other windows programs like paint. The touch appears to not work only in my applications.p  pHas anyone else experienced this or have any idea how to reenable the touch eventsp

Negative 2370 pThe problem i am facing is that I have a spreadsheet that pulls data from an intranet site that stores credentials in a cookie on the browser. My macro does authenticate into the site via internet explorer, but the hyperlinks i add to the data that lead back to the site will open in the default browser of the user. Is there a way to change which browser the Hyperlinks method will open, or is there a way to forward the request directly to the default browser of the user without going through Microsoft Office Protocol Discovery Hyperlinks in Outlook open directly to the default browser, is there a reason excel does not Or is there a way to somehow grab that cookie and send it with the request Any help would be appreciated.p

If the corresponding bytes of d2,a4,00 are 00010001, 00110010, 00000000, then by concatenating these binary values gives me 000100010011001000000000, which if converted into an integer gives me, lets say 1000200. So, i can access the information related to that mac address using array[1000200].  p  pIf i want to do it in reverse direction, lets say i was given 1000200 number, how can i convert it into mac address 002334d2a400Assuming first 3 bytes are same for all entries.

Negative 2370 pHaving some problem developing a SignalR client for a Hub hosted in asp.net website with gzip compression enabled. Since we are using IIS compression, the response from SignalR also gets compressed, but, the client does not understand the response and we get a Json parsing error on the client side. p  pSignalR internally uses codeHttpWebRequestcode to make make http requests and codeHttpWebRequestcode can be configured to automatically decompress the response using codeAutomaticDecompressioncode property. So, if somehow I can get hold of the codeHttpWebRequestcode object used by SignalR to make the request, I should be able to set the enable automatic decompression.p  pI thought I should be able to get access to the codeHttpWebRequestcode by providing codeHubConnection.Startcode with my custom implementation of codeIHttpClientcode, codeIHttpClient.GetAsynccode takes a codeprepareRequestcode action which I thought should give me access to the codeHttpWebRequestcode, but, codeHttpHelper.GetAsynccode wraps the codeHttpWebRequestcode with codeHttpWebRequestWrappercode before passing to codeprepareRequestcode and codeHttpWebRequestWrappercode does not provide access to codeHttpWebRequestcode. p  pcodeHttpHelpercode class is internal so cant use it as well, so, I am not exactly sure how to enable automatic decompression with SignalR. p  pI can expose the codeHttpWebRequestcode in codeHttpWebRequestWrappercode, but, would prefer a simpler solution if one exists.

Negative 2370 pI am developing .NET WEB Api REST Service using framework 4.5 and the architectural direction now is to separate functional areas of our API. In other words, placing controllers into separate assemblies, e.g. having controllers in assemblies like company.web.administration, company.web.claims, etc.p  pAfter experimenting with it, I noticed the power of the MVC framework. I can place controllers into separate class libraries but as long as these libraries are in the bin folder, they strongdont even have to be referencedstrong. MVC finds them in the assemblies and API calls work fine.p  pBut under this architecture, the problem arises that we might get large number of these controller libraries. So, it would be helpful to pack them together under bincontrollers, for example.

Negative 2370 pThis is a longshot question, so bear with me. p  pI like to have my code warning free so that I can quickly determine if I have a warning that truly needs to be dealt with.  I have it set that if certain javadoc items are not correct, it will display a warning.  In the team I work with, they are not concerned with javadoc warnings in the unit tests.  These tests are always at srctestjava.  Unfortunately if there is a warning in the test, it not only shows the warning icon on the code folder srctestjava, but also on the project itself.  Im tempted just to javadoc all of their unit tests, but its not a good use of my time.  Is there a way to tell eclipse to ignore warnings from srctestjava or trigger different warnings for my tests than for my implementationp

Negative 2370 pI wanted to write a meteor app, that can post a tweet. Since accountstwitter goes through all the oAuth process and has all the data needed to make an authorized call to the Twitter API, I thought thats gonna be no problem.p  pAs it turns out, its a little trickier than that. By default, accountstwitter only exports the profile with the name of the logged in user.

It should not be in the profile, but on the toplevel for which I need to touch the accountsbaseaccountsserver.js, I guess. 2. It should not be accessible on the client side I guess, because that would allow stealing this info via XSS etc.p  pCan anybody give me some hint on how to implement that properlyp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 2370 pOkay, Im going to try to simplify this example as much as possible. Heres my problem. Im using node and express with jade to generate html. I have a main layout.jade file which at the end of the body contains thisp  precodeblock scripts   scriptsrcjavascriptslibsjquery1.8.1.min.js codepre  pThen I have a jade partial shapes.jade which has the following codep  precodeblock append scripts   scriptsrcjavascriptswire.js codepre  pThen I have my jade file propertiespanel.jade which generates the htmlp  precodeextends ..layout  include shapes  block controls   include ..controls codepre  pThe wire.js file needs jQuery to run. The html output from jade is exactly as I would expect it to be. I have a block of script tags at the end of the body tag, and in the correct order jQuery first.p  pThe problem is that jQuery is not being loaded by the browser first. BUT, then it seems to also load the file again after jQuery has loaded. I have deduced this because my wire.js file is wrapped in a selfexecuting anonymous function like thisp  precodefunction context,     console.log this, window.jQuery codepre  pAnd in my console I get 2 logs. the first one says undefined and the second one logs jQuery correctly.p  pSo heres the weird part though. If I comment out the script line from my shapes.jade, and instead add it to the layout.jade file after the jQuery import line, it generates the exact same html file, but everything loads in the correct order then.p  pUsing the chrome developer tools, I can see the load order in the resources tab and even though the html does not change at all, the load order changes depending on the way the jade file generates the same identical html.p  pAm I doing something wrong Im relatively new to jade, so I may very well be.p  pThanksp

Negative 2370 pI installed the freeglut3 and freeglut3dev by aptget. I want to create a OPENGL GLUT Project in Codeblocks. I was asked the GLUTs location and I entered usr as I found in a tutorial. But I got the error messagep  pThe path you entered seems valid, but this wizard cant locate the following GLUTs library file glut in it.p  pDid I set the right location What is the right way to setup up such a glut projectp
Negative 2370 pOkay, Im stumped... Ive reinstalled this instance 3 times now and I cant seem to figure it out. Ive pretty much followed this tutorial a hrefhttpcalebogden.comwordpressonlinuxintheamazoncloudwithmac relnofollowhttpcalebogden.comwordpressonlinuxintheamazoncloudwithmaca word for word with one exception, I installed phpmyadmin v3.5.5 from the phpMyAdmin website.p  pAlso, instead of installing it though Terminal, I did it with Coda, drag and dropped into the varwwwhtml folder through SFTP.p  pThe EC2 Instance is an Amazon Linux AMI 2012.09 64 bit.p  pThe problemp  pI went to phpMyAdminsetupindex.php created a New server with a cookie Authentication typep  pI only changed the Verbose name of this server and Password for config auth.p  pNow when I go to phpMyAdminsetupindex.php to log in, and typep  pUN Root PW mypassword Which Im using the one I created when I installed mySQLp  pusrbinmysqladmin u root password SUPERSECUREPASSWORDp  pI keep getting this error 1045 Cannot log in to the MySQL serverp  pI know Im typing the password in just as I typed it in terminal. Sorry for the long post for such a simple question, I just wanted to be as detailed as possible in case I did something wrong. p  pThanks in advance for any help.p
Negative 2370 pAfter some anguish trying to connect to a SQLServer database with Ruby, I finally discovered a hrefhttpsgithub.comrailssqlservertinytds relnofollowTinyTDSa and its fantastic.  p  pHowever, it requires a username and password to talk to the database.  In C tests in the past, weve used SSPI to supply this, so that any tester can pick up a script and run it and itll use their Windows Authentication details.p  pI cant find a way to do this with TDS beginning to suspect its not possible with the current version and hoping someone might prove me wrong, or have another suggestionp  pCheers.p
Negative 2370 pI am building an app for a festival. On thing is that I show a scrollable image the festival area where I must be able to zoom in and out and scroll too it. You can see an example image below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8p5TE.jpg altenter image description herep  pLike you can see over here, there are three stages Wablief, Marquee, The shelter. Now I should be able to click on those stages. When I click on a stage a tableview should pop up as a modalView with the artists in it. p  pNow my question is how can I achieve that Keep in mind that this image should be scrollable and zoomable.

Negative 2370 pIm using Aptana Studio 3 for PHP development. I know there is a snippet for PHPDoc blocks generation for classes and methods type doc, press ctrlspace and appropriate snippet is inserted. The problem is that its only possible to use it for new methods, docf snippet inserts something like thisp  precode   undocumented function     return void   author     function functionName   codepre  pSo whenever I have a method I want to document, I still have to manually insert all data regarding arguments and returned value. I remember that in PDT Eclipse I used long time ago there was a convenient hotkey ctrlshiftj IIRC that automatically filled all those PHPDoc params for a selected element, but it doesnt work in Aptana. Is there any better way for generating DocBlocks for PHP in Aptana Studio, other than just manually typing it in for each undocumented method and classp

Negative 2370 pI have image and I want it to be fullscreen in the layout. Then I want to place  icon on a particular place of the image the problem is that the icon doesnt lie on the same place when I run the application on multiple screen sizes.p  pThe only thing that worked fine is that I used a fixed width and height for the image in the xml layout file. But this is not enough to me I want it to be with the fullscreen size eventhough the image is stretched and also on all screen sizes and densities. Anybody has solved this issuep  pActually, I am using the following codep  precodepublic class MainActivity extends Activity   double [] X 60,100,140 double [] Y 65,105,145  Parameter for icons on Image RelativeLayout.LayoutParams [] params  Parameter for the Whole Screen FrameLayout.LayoutParams ScreenParams  RelativeLayout rl ImageView [] iv Context cox  RelativeLayout.LayoutParams paramss ImageView vvv  SuppressWarningsdeprecation Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain     cox  this      Screen Density     double Density  getResources.getDisplayMetrics.densityDpi     Log.vDensity is  , Density      Screen HeightWidth     double ScreenHeight  getResources.getDisplayMetrics.heightPixels     double ScreenWidth  getResources.getDisplayMetrics.widthPixels      Log.vScreen Width before  , ScreenWidth     Log.vScreen Height before  , ScreenHeight      double ScreenHeight  ScreenHeight  Density160     double ScreenWidth  ScreenWidth  Density160     Log.vScreen Width after  , ScreenWidth     Log.vScreen Height after  , ScreenHeight       ScreenParams  new FrameLayout.LayoutParamsintScreenWidth,intScreenHeight      rl  RelativeLayout findViewByIdR.id.rel1      iv  new ImageView[X.length]     params  new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams[X.length]      Toast.makeTextcox, Density is  Density, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show      forint i  0  iltX.length  i              Log.vX before  , X[i]         Log.vY before  , Y[i]          X[i]  X[i]Density160         Y[i]  Y[i]Density160          Log.vX after  , X[i]         Log.vY after  , Y[i]          iv[i]  new ImageViewthis         iv[i].setBackgroundDrawablegetResources.getDrawableR.drawable.star           double xx  21Density160         double yy  21Density160          params[i]  new RelativeLayout.LayoutParamsintxx,intyy         params[i].leftMargin  int X[i]         params[i].topMargin  int Y[i]          iv[i].setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener              Override             public void onClickView v                                     new AlertDialog.Buildercox                 .setTitle                 .setMessageImage                  .setPositiveButtonsdfsdfddddd,                         new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                              Override                             public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int which                                  dialog.cancel                                                               .setNegativeButton, null.show                                iv[i].setOnTouchListenernew OnTouchListener              Override             public boolean onTouchView v, MotionEvent event                   float X  event.getX                 float Y  event.getY                       Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, X  XnY  Y, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                  return false                                int arr[]  new int[2]         arr[0]int X[i]         arr[1]int Y[i]          iv[i].getLocationOnScreenarr          Toast.makeTextcox, , Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show          Add ImageView item to the layout         rl.addViewiv[i], params[i]           rl.setOnTouchListenernew OnTouchListener          Override         public boolean onTouchView v, MotionEvent event              float X  event.getX             float Y  event.getY                              Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, X  XnY  Y, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show             return false                  codepre  pAnd Android xml layout file isp  precode ltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidididrel1 xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt  ltImageView     androidididimageView1     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent I used fixed length here 250dip     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent I used fixed length here 250dip     androidscaleTypefitXY     androidsrcdrawableworld gt  ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre

Sorry for the mixup.p  pstrongEdit2strong clarification on the use of LibNoDavep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI am now running the unmodified software on a freshly installed linux machine. So far no complications have occurred. This leads me to assume that the problem may lie with the Java installation on the machine running eclipse.p  pIs it possible that there may have been complications during one or any Java updates that could have led to JNA misbehavingp  pI am not all that familiar with the Java update process, but from what Ive read recently, its not at all uncommon for Java to  for lack of a better term  break itself.p
Negative 2370 pIm trying to learn MVP, but something eludes me if the Presenter uses the view as an interface, then the View cannot be just a simple rendering of controls. Imagine trying to write a typingpractice game, where words are randomly generated into the UI and the user must type the words as they fall down the screen.p  pSo the view is going to have methods likep  precodepublic interface View      addWordString word, double x, double y  or possibly Word word     moveWordString word, double distance     removeWordString word     setScoreint score     registerKeyListenerKeyListener listener      other stuff  codepre  pBut ultimately the VIEW is going to have to be responsible for creating custom controls. A lot of code is omitted here, but hopefully this is enough to illustrate what I mean. Examplep  precodepublic class SwingView      private JPanel thePanel      private MapltString, WordComponentgt currentWords  new HashMapltgt      public SwingView          thePanel  new JPanelnew WordLayout          other stuff           public void addWordString word, double x, double y          WordComponent newWord  new WordComponentword         currentWords.putword, newWord         Point2D.Double point  new Point2D.Doublex, y         thePanel.addnewWord, point           public void removeWordString word          WordComponent theWord  currentWords.gettheWord         thePanel.removetheWord       codepre  pAlready the View implementation has logic going on. Its maintaining a codeMapcode of its codeWordComponentcodes. I have two classes of my own here, codeWordLayout implements LayoutManager2code, and codeWordComponent extends JLabelcode or something else, but that would be even MORE code. p  pIn theory, the presenter should know nothing about Swing, so I can unit test with a mock that maybe logs to the console or something. But simply managing the Swing objects is a job into itself. Or, what if I wanted to transform this application into a Tomcat Webpage. Now class codeServletViewcode is managing the AJAX calls that move the words around. Which has a dependency on the AJAX framework, which is even more work offloaded to the codeViewcode.p  pSummary Are codeViewcode implementations supposed to have logic that manage their own componentsp  pFollowup The code I wrote above probably wont even be responsive, because the codeModelcode and the codePresentercode arent working on the Event Dispatch thread or, they are, which is probably worse. Where does the code that hands off display updates to the Event Dispatch thread go Or, should the codePresentercode be on the Event Dispatch threadp  pstrongEditstrong One idea just occurred to me. Having a platformspecific subpresenter that emisem aware of implementation details like whether youre using Swing or something else.p  pstrongEdit2strong Still another question, based on DuncanJones answer. Imagine I wanted to put logic to make the game resizeable and scale the size of everything based on the new size. Would that logic be in the codeViewcode, or in the codePresentercodep

Negative 2370 pfirst off, I have read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9775193masonrydynamicslideshowheightissuesthis posta and its approach is not good, but does work, here is my issuep  pI am mixing infinite scroll with jquery masonry. My contents height can change before the next posts load. I have a script that will redo the positioning when heights change, but that cannot be applied to posts that are not loaded yet.p  pWhen the new posts load, it seems that some of them will overlap if heights increased. This is because masonry is applied on the new posts, and they are codeappendedcode based on the memory of where the end was from the last masonry callback.p  pI cannot simply call masonry every time the heights change because with new heights means that a new call of masonry will make content in different places, and that will be very sloppyp  h1questionh1  pThe way I see to solve this problem is if I could somehow change the positions that masonry seems to put into memory strongwithoutstrong recalling all of masonry on the shown content. p  pIs this possible with masonry, and how can I achieve itp

Negative 2370 pIm looking for some direction on an AWS architictural decision. My goal is to allow users to ftp a file to an EC2 instance and then run some analysis on the file. My focus is to build this in as much a serviceoriented way as possible.. and in the future scale it out for multiple clients where each would have there own ftp server and processing queue with no comingling of data.p  pCurrently I have a dev EC2 instance with vsftpd installed and a node.js process running Chokidar that is continuously watching for new files to be dropped. When that file drops Id like for another server or group of servers to be notified to get the file and process it.p  pShould the ftp server move the file to S3 and then use SQS to let the pool of processing servers know that its ready for processing Should I use SQS and then have the pool of servers ssh into the ftp instance or other approach to get the file rather than use S3 as a intermediary Are there better approachesp  pAny guidance is very much appreciated. Feel free to school me on any alternate ideas that might save money at high file volume.p  pThank you for the help.p

My ultimate goal is to provide seamless user experience while a game is waiting for Game Center authentication handler being called, and a loading scene being displayed from the very start of the app awaked from background would be sufficient not only preventing user interaction which can be done many ways, but not showing previous game UI to the user. However, this solution is susceptible to the problem described above  if user taps the home button during scene transition he is going to get a very strange screen after bringing the game from background.p  pEDIT After some more research I didnt find any satisfactory solution to replacing scene during codeCCTransitioncode, however, problem described above was solved by not calling codereplaceScenecode but by adding a loading codeCCLayercode to the visible codeCCScenecode, as LearnCocos2D thanks Steffen suggested. This is not perfect, since adding a child during scene transition still has some narrow window in the sense of running time when strange results occur, but it is much better than replacing the scene. I would like to mention that it only concerns me when testing my game on 3GS, since newer devices are significantly faster and it is very difficult to reproduce the problem of home button clicking during codeCCTransitioncode on something faster than 3GS.p

Negative 2370 pUsing VS2012 to create a web application in VB, I have the following issuep  pI create a aspCalendarExtender that populates a aspTextBox.  This Textbox has the property EnabledFalse assigned to it.  Once the aspCalendarExtender has been called it will place a date in the TextBox in the format Sept 1 2000.p  pI now want to use JQuery to detect this change.  I have come across many examples which rely on a text change using the keyboard or a Blur, but none of these work.  I have even attached a JQuery event to the button that triggers the Calendar to popup that removes the EnabledFalse property of the aspTextBox [My train of thought was to remove the enabled property, allow the JQuery to detect a pasted change, then disable the textbox again]p  pAny ideas or suggestions gratefully received.p
Negative 2370 pCan two threads use the same socket at the same timep  pfor example, first i open a socket that represents a connection between Android client and windows 7 server.  i want to send an integer that is the size of the file by using DataOutputStream, then after this i will use BufferedOutputStream to send the binary file, such as a pdfp  pthe server will get the size sent by the client and then check if the size of the file received is the correct size. it compares the send integer, file size number with the actual size of the file received.  if there is any difference than the server knows that the file is not complete and then it will send a message back to the client to request that the file be sent again.p  pi have an app where the file is received as incomplete about 5 of the time. it arrives smaller than the actual size.  the only way to fix this problem is to resend the file again if it is not completep  pif i send a file, it is required to have a port open and waiting to receive a message back from the server telling the client if the file was received complete or has to be resent.p  pso is it possible to have one thread using the socket and listening for any messages and on another thread sending a message.  so that if a message is being received back from the server at the same time one is being sent.p  pit is clear that using only one thread will block and that two threads are needed but to use the same socket are there possible problems with thisp

I am running a mobile redirect script for the mobile version of my site. I also have a header.php and footer.php running in my includes folder. However, I get the above warning when I try to access my site through my android. Someone tried to check on their iPhone and the same thing occurred. Below the warning, the desktop version of the site displays. In my index.php, here is the code that shows directly above my first  command this forum wont let me display correctly what is before this code so, whats there is the code here Doctype Html, aboutthree lines of   if ie7,8,9 lines, a html head, some meta charsetutf8 the title and meta descriptions and keywords.

First, detect iPhone tier devices, like iPod Touches, Android, WebOS, etc.        Send them to the nice touchoptimized page.        These often have rich CSS and advanced but mobilefriendly JavaScript functionality and no Flash.    Second, detect any other mobile device. Send them to the basic mobile pages, with light CSS and no JavaScript.       Some often older touch devices might be included in this bunch, which otherwise includes feature phones.       Its a Best Practice to include an alternate web page for lesscapable mobile devices.     Finally, assume anything else not caught by these filters is a desktop PCclass device.        Send them to your regular home page which may include large pictures, lots of JS, Flash, etc..        NOTE If you wanted an iPadclass tabletoptimized web site, too, then you should FIRST do a        device detection using the DetectTierTablet method. Then detect for iPhone tier, and so on.      In this simple example, we simply reroute depending on which type of device it is.   Before we can call the function, we have to define it.    function AutoRedirectToProperHomePage          global uagentobj, iphoneTierHomePage, genericMobileDeviceHomePage      We have variables for certain highusage device variables, like the iPhone Tier.        You might use the device variables to showhide certain functionality or platformspecific features and ads, etc.        Alternately, you can use the method DetectTierIphone.        Sometimes, you may wish to include the Tablet Tier devices here, as well.        if uagentobjgtisTierIphone  uagentobjgttrue        header Location .iphoneTierHomePage      We can generally use the Quick Mobile detection method to save a couple of cycles.       else if uagentobjgtDetectMobileQuick  uagentobjgttrue        header Location .genericMobileDeviceHomePage      Well assume that anything else not caught in the above filters is a desktopclass device.

Of course there is no such token codehcode, but if there were, the pattern space would match, and the output would bep  precodeone foo three codepre  pDoes codesedcode provide any way to do thisp  pMy goal here is to count all such matches in a large file 4MB.

Negative 2370 pBefore you respond, yes, Ive read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6430374isthereamaximumsizethatwebpagesshouldbekeptunderthisa post.p  pThe difference in emmyem question is that Im not looking for best practice, or internet speed considerations, so much as the actual maximum browsers or each browser if you wish to, or have to, be specific can handle before they crash, and also how big of a file the php engine can handle before emitem crashes.p  pThe reason being is Im building a online job application for a company I work for, and I have lots of necessary JavaScript validation though, I put what I could in external js files to prevent SPAM amp abuse. I also have PHP intertwined with JavaScript to test if PHP is active, if not it falls back to JavaScript functions. I also have jQuery, MooTools, and more like such... Not to mention all the required questions, textboxs, dropdowns, radio buttons, check boxes, and textareas.p  pThe problem is that Ive only completed one section of the online application and my file is already at 32 KB. Considering the amount of work Ive done, and what I have left to do, I can see this htmlphp .php file easly reaching 200KBp  pSo I need to know the true maximum limit to both the typical HTML browser and serverside PHP engine.p  pThanks in advance,p  pJamesp

Negative 2370 pIs there an equivalent in c for the following code in Javap  precodeListlt extends Numbergt list list  new ArrayListltFloatgt list  new ArrayListltIntegergt list.addFloat.valueOf4.0  doesnt compile and it is fine Number e  list.get0  workds codepre  pI was reading about covariant types in cp  precodeListltSomeClassgt list2  new ListltSomeClassgt IEnumerableltObjectgt list3  list2  works codepre  pFrom whatever I understand all the interfacesclasses in Java are supporting covariance by default. Depending on the type parameter used in the declaration, features method that take the parameterized types as input that dont follow covariance are not supported. Meaning, codeListlt extends Numbergtcode  can take a reference of codeListltIntegergt or a ListltDoublegtcode, but it would no longer support methods like add.p  pNow, on the other side in C, looks like I need to find an interface that supports Covariance and then use it. So, whenever I want to write some generic class, I have to write a separate interface that supports all covariant operations for all derived classes and make sure my class implements that interface Is this correct or am I missing something.p  pThanksp

Negative 2370 pI have the following situation My problem revolves around using strongly typed enum classes as flags just as in C with the FlagsAttribute. I know this is not the way enum classes were meant to be used in the first place, but that it not the point of this question. p  pI have defined several operators and functions to use on these enum classes, and a custom type trait to distinguish normal enums from Flagenums. Heres an examplep  precode Default typetrait which disables the following operators template lttypename Tgt struct isflags  stdfalsetype    Example operator to use enum class as flags template lttypename Tgt stdenableiftltstdisenumltTgtvalue ampamp isflagsltTgtvalue, Tampgt operatorT ampt1, const T t2      return t1  staticcastltTgtstaticcastltstdunderlyingtypetltTgtgtt1                                  staticcastltstdunderlyingtypetltTgtgtt2  codepre  pNow if I define any codeenum classcode i can do the followingp  precodeenum class Foo  A  1, B  2   enum class Bar  A  1, B  2    Declare Bar to be useable like Flags template ltgt struct isflagsltBargt  stdtruetype    void test      Foo f     Bar b     f  FooA  Doesnt compile, no operator      b  BarA  Compiles, typetrait enables the operator  codepre  pThe above code works fine and using a macro for the template specialization it almost looks like the very convenient C FlagsAttribute. p  pHowever, when the codeenum classcode is not defined in namespace scope, I run into an issuep  precodestruct X      enum class Bar  A  1, B  2        Following line gives C3412 Cannot specialize template in current scope     template ltgt struct isflagsltBargt  stdtruetype   codepre  pThe type trait cannot be specialized here. I would need to define the trait outside of X, which is possible, but separates the FlagAttribute from the enum declaration. It would be so nice to use this in our code since flags are used all over the place but in a rather oldfashioned manner codeintcode  codedefinecode. All solutions to this problem I have found so far focus on classes instead of enums, where the solution is much simpler, since I can define the trait as a member of the class itself. Enums, however, cannot inherit, contain typedefs or whatever might be needed to differentiate a certain enum class from another. p  pSo is there any possibility to define some kind of trait in a classscope which can be used in global namespace scope to recognize special enum classtypes p  pstrongEDITstrong I should add that Im using Visual Studio 2013. p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Thanks for the answers, the tagsolution worked really well, although I had to make a subtle change making it even more simple in the process. Im now using this custom type traitp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt struct isflags  private     template lttypename Ugt static stdtruetype checkdecltypeUFlags     template lttypenamegt static stdfalsetype check...      typedef decltypecheckltTgt0 result public     static const bool value  stdisenumltTgtvalue ampamp resultvalue  codepre  pNow, all I need to do is add codeFlagscode to the enum class, no matter what scope its inp  precodeenum class Foo  Flags, A  0x0001, B  0x0002  codepre  pSee also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma85974981314789herea for a similar problem and solution. p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Since Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 this solution will cause compiler crashes when the codeisflagscode trait is applied to iosbase headers. Therefore we are now using a different and cleaner approach, we use a template class which acts as the storage for an codeenum classcode and defines all operators on itself without any typetrait magic. The template class can be created implicit with the underlying codeenum classcode and explicit with the underlying type. Works a charm and is much less of an codeenableifcodemess. p

I have a test suite which only shows the method name on my TestNG report  but then I have other test suites that are concatenating the test description after the method name and displaying that entire string on the report under the 2nd column after the class name column.   I cant figure out what controls this difference.p  pDoes anyone understand how this works and is enableddisabled in the suite   In this scenario, TestNG is being executed by the Maven Surefire plugin, which as you know, places the emailable report under the target directory rather than under testngoutput.p  pAlso, an additional detail I am wondering about is can the description be altered during the Test method so that the altered description can be shown on the reportp  pThis screenshot shows the favorable display of group and description but I have many other test suites that do not show this information and I want to know how to enable it.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlH3aH.png altenter image description herep
Negative 2370 pIm trying to implement a simple code testing server. The client will submit their code on the webpage and we will run it with two test cases which could take several minutes and well post the results. The page will be simple with a submission form and an output box.p  pMy problem is with updating the output box. Im looking for the emsimplestem way to implement the output box so that we show results as we run different test cases.p  pI tried googling for solutions and I found some like socket.io but my experience with ajax and socket.io or even js is very limited so Im looking for the simplest way to do this.p

I send object of type Message which I defined in another class..p  pI googled a little bit, and found out, that the problem is in stream and it should be reseted after each data had gone through stream.

Negative 2370 pIm having a hard time understanding why codewhile cin.getChcode doesnt see the codeEOFcode.

Was wondering if you all had a solution.p  pYoull notice the negative margin hits a limit at around 212 for image elements. Is there a reason for this Can you think of a work aroundp  pstrongWhy I Need This what Ive triedstrongp  pIm making a fluid layout and I want to display a rating system. I have a sprite sheet of stars similar to the one in the fiddle that I want to reuse at various sizes. p  pBecause the size changes I cant use a background image. So I decided to use an image inside a container with a variable width and codeoverflowhiddencode. The sprite sheet adjusts to the width of the container and the containers viewable content is determined by a codepaddingtop20code. This is so it can be fluid with its width since every star is a box, the total height is 20 the width.p  pThen I try and position the star image inside the container with margintop. I tried using codepositionrelativecode and a codetopXcode, but because the container technically has no height this was causing issue on mobile phones 100 of 0 is 0, etc.p  pSo I assumed negative margin would work, but then discovered this strange issuep  pemstrongNOTEstrong Because it affects only the last row I can make it work in my situation by using a paddingbottom instead of top thereby bumping every star row up 1, but this isnt an adequate solution for me because it just ignores the problem. What if I wanted quarter starsemp

Negative 2370 pI have a complex Visual Studio solution working with the data from a database. The database will be modified according to the new business rules, for this reason a new database will be created.p  pThe user needs to work for some years with the old database too.

The two versions of the application will be installed on the same PCs.p  pNo new funktion will be added to the old version of the application, only bug fixing. Actually I do not see any reason to create a branch. I just want to have on the hand the code of the old version if any bug has to be fixed any way actually it is a very stable version, without issues since 6 monthsp  pI am just thinking simply to clone the solution folder and create a new product version for the new version. Of course I will take care of all paths and references in the new folder, while the solution consist of many projects and assemblies more than twenty. p  pHas this way any drawback or shall I go in any case with a version controlling svn In the past with visual studio 56 I was used to clone the project folder for each new major release and it had always worked.

Negative 2370 pI had a test right now and this was one of the questionsp  pstrongInputstrongp  pThe places to visit in the labyrinth are numbered from 1 to n. The entry and the exit correspond to number 1 and number n, respectively the remaining numbers correspond to crossings. Note that there are no dead ends and there is no more than one connection linking a pair of crossings. For each test case, the first line gives n and the number of connections between crossings m. Then, in each of the following m lines, you find a pair of integers corresponding to the connection between two crossings.p  pstrongOutputstrongp  pFor each test case, your implementation should output one single line containing Found, if it is possible to reach the exit by visiting every crossing once or Damn, otherwise.

Negative 2370 pI was trying to change my apps name earlier and for whatever reason what I normally do didnt work and so now things are sort of screwed up. I ended up manually changing the app name in various places in xcode and now the name appears to have successfully changed.p  pThe app currently cleans, builds, and runs fine for both the simulator and my physical iPhone.p  pHowever, one thing that is bothering me is that if I go to the Project Navigator, and scroll down and view the contents of the Products folder, my code.xctestcode file is red. If I select it, and then view its details in the File Inspector on the right, and click the arrow button to view it in the finder, it doesnt take me anywhere.p  pIf I open the folder that its supposed to be in with Finder, it currently has 4 files. 2 of the files are code.appcode files, one has the old app name and the other has the new app name.

Negative 2370 pI am building a software that will store and manage doctors data. I would like to ask something that came to me and has to do with how I want to deploy my project. At first I wanted to have different django instance for each client. Each clinet would have his own database and run seperatelly from the others. But I am not sure I can automate this procedure, because for each instance I need to have different database, different password different db username, something that I am not sure It can be automated  while creating a every new instance of my django project.

Imagine the following scenariop  precodeUser pays gt After successfull payment gt DBMySQL is created gt  django instance is created gt  somehow django settings file is updated with db credentials gt syncdb is run codepre  pand this procedure must be automated.

Both of these things worked fine when running the packages directly in VS Shell. p  pWhile trying to troubleshoot these issues, I realized that I do not actually have integration services installed on my machine  just the designer. I will not be able to get integration services soon, at least so I would like to figure out how to launch VS Shell, validate, build and execute my SSIS load packages  not using the DTExec utility, but actually launching in the VS Shell using Windows Scheduler. p  pI know that to launch the program itself, I would just schedule devenv.exe. But what arguments do I use to validate, build and execute the packages using this method. The only thing I can find about executing packages involves using the utility, and assumes that the user has SSIS installed, not just the designer. p  pNow, if worse comes to worse I can just execute the load packages and then create some sql queries to pull together the row counts and other stuff I will need to audit the data, but it seems like there should be a way to do what I want to do.p

Negative 2370 pI am checking whether there are existing solutions procedures for the following scenario.

Negative 2370 pI have a primefaces datatable which has a list of values being displayed. And every row has a Open  button which navigates to other page for details and on the same page i have a back button which takes me page to the previous visited page. so it comes to the datatable page which gets refreshed to the original state...it does not maintain the records which the user had searched. My Managed Bean is in viewscope. I want to the records to be maintained even if the user navigates to other pages and comes back to the same page. I tried making the managed bean Session scoped that solves the issue but on page refresh the datatable does not get refreshed .even if we do a Controlrefresh it still maintains the same recordsp

Negative 2370 pI have a twitter share button on a webpage. I have submitted my website for twitter cards, and it is approved. I am using the twitter card tags correctly, but I have troubles to get the images appear on the timeline. On the twitter timeline I only see text and the URL. Only when clicking on the tweet, an image appears below the tweet expands.p  pI would like to have this image appear on the timeline, without needing to expand the tweet. Is this possible, or am is it necessary to use a service like twitpic or flickr to make this happenp  pMy first thought is that this is not possible because twitter only accepts certain image websites to publish their images on the twitter timeline, but I cannot find a twitter dev source that confirms this.p

Negative 2370 pI have a couple of production servers running Tomcat 7.0 with an APRSSL connector and because of the recent POODLE attack I was asked to disable SSLv3 completely in some of these servers. I dig through the a hrefhttptomcat.apache.orgtomcat7.0docconfighttp.htmlSSLSupport relnofollowTomcat Connectorsa documentation and according to it, setting codeSSLProtocolcode to codeTLSv1code instead of codeallcode should be sufficient to disable SSLv3 and enforce TLSv1.p  pThe problem is that codeTLSv1code seems to enable TLS but does not make the server refuse SSLv3. I tested this using codeopenssl sclient connect ssl3code and I verified that plainold SSLv3 connections can still be accepted, so I was wondering if this is a bug in Tomcat or if there is something else that I need to set to disabled SSLv3 completely.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I disabled APR for now and reverted to using a NIO connector with codesslProtocolTLScode and that works fine.

I have looked through the JavaDoc for 4.7, but I am not seeing anything.  I saw RealTimeGet, but that seems to not be what I am looking for.p  pAre there any hooks available builtin to Solr, or am I going to have to rollmyown using the logs to determine what has been changed in the indexp
Negative 2370 pWhen I call codedrawImagecode after having used codetranslatecode, if both of the calls are within the drawing loop then codedrawImagecode will base its x,y coordinates on the original x,y coordinates of the canvas element.

Negative 2370 pCOM is a standard of how a object is represented in memory, in binary level. With that in mind, use a COM object in any language is easy. You just need to interpret memory in a way that COM require and youll have the COM object in your control.p  pI think CLR was created with the same ideas of interoperability, but with a layer of abstraction, like, an own language not binary. With that in mind, how CLR achieve a binary level of interoperability like COM achieved Or dont achievedp  pCOM and CLR are complementary things Or are things that replace each other, because is what MS seems to been doing.p  pWith COM you dont depends of a Virtual Machine.

Negative 2370 pI need this for a custom app, built for a specific company, so it will not be on Google Play. I have an app, that uses about 15 SQLite tables. It needs to be able to work offline and online, so I have to use SQLite to keep information for the offline part. The main idea is that when user on Android touches a button, an update process is starting. The logic of the update is p  ol liFor each local table I have a AsyncTask class dealing with the update process described bellowli liEvery local SQLite table have an id field autoincrement AND idremote field to be filled with MySQL id of the record plus the rest of the fieldsli liEach time the update starts, the app prepares a string containing all idremote ids from the local table and sends it to the serverli liOn the server side, a PHP file receives the string of IDs and checks in the MySQL table, to see if there are new IDs that are not in the received String of ids each AsyncTask has its own php file on the serverli liIf the PHP finds in MySQL table new ids, then it sends the new records using JSON back to Androidli liI process the resulting JSON in onPostExecute of the AsyncTask and insert the new records in the SQLite tableli ol  pSo I have 15 AsyncTask classes that all perform the same operations as above, each of them dealing with a specific table. I also do the update of the remote tables sending the new records to MySQL through the same mechanismp  pMy problem is that I want to be able to seeknow when the update is donefinished so I can notify the user of that fact, but since we are talking about multiple AsyncTasks ... that run simultaneously... I have no idea how to implement this. How to find out when all the AsyncTasks are donep  pOr is there a better way to do this task The update of the localremote tablesp  pThank youp
Negative 2370 pI have a shiny app that allows users to upload their own data and do a few tasks. Depending on their data size and the type of tasks they would want to perform, sometimes the process gets long and even lasting forever.

How should I do itp  pMy second question is related to the first one. Say one of my app users has deployed a very heavy process and it has heavily occupied my CPU but the user himself has not initiated the stop signal. I would like to impose a time out command so that the app will be automatically terminated say after 5 minutes. How can I set it upp  pMany thanks and best regards,p  pcloudyp

If the screen will only accommodate 4.5 columns  400px then I would like the width to adjust to 450px or 25p  pUnless the screen resolution is a smart phone in which case width should be 100.p  pThe columns must be ordered from left to right.p  pFloating LIs to the left at 400px doesnt work and I cannot use a  base because I dont know in the context of CSS how many will fit...p  pPerhaps I could hardcode media queries with conditional testsp  precodemedia all and maxwidth 768px       width 100  media all and maxwidth 800px and minwidth 1200px       width 50  media all and maxwidth 1200px and minwidth 1600px       width 25  media all and maxwidth 1600px and minwidth 2000px       width 20  codepre  pBasically, I am trying to make a grid, which maximizes screen space but collapses vertically as screen space lessens.p  pAny ideas Masonary and similar JS libraries are not what I am after but I will consider implementing this in AngularJS if its the bestonly optionp
Negative 2370 pi am new in laravel4,i am developing a website and create an user registration functionality successfully.After a registration,the certain user will get an email for account activation,which is absolutely working fine in my web app.p  pstrongbut the problem is , the verification code which should be appear as a hyperlink,not appearing as a hyperlink except Gmail,that is,in other email service provider like yahoo,outlook,GMX... that verification code is not appearing as hyperlink.. only appearing as a plain text.strongp  pnow here is my mail.php filep  precodeltphp  return array     Mail Driver    Laravel supports both SMTP and PHPs mail function as drivers for the  sending of email. You may specify which one youre using throughout  your application here. By default, Laravel is setup for SMTP mail.   Supported smtp, mail, sendmail, mailgun, mandrill, log    driver gt smtp,     SMTP Host Address    Here you may provide the host address of the SMTP server used by your  applications. A default option is provided that is compatible with  the Mailgun mail service which will provide reliable deliveries.    host gt mail.forgroup.com,     SMTP Host Port    This is the SMTP port used by your application to deliver emails to  users of the application. Like the host we have set this value to  stay compatible with the Mailgun email application by default.    port gt 465,     Global From Address    You may wish for all emails sent by your application to be sent from  the same address. Here, you may specify a name and address that is  used globally for all emails that are sent by your application.    from gt arrayaddress gt .com, name gt ,     EMail Encryption Protocol    Here you may specify the encryption protocol that should be used when  the application send email messages. A sensible default using the  transport layer security protocol should provide great security.    encryption gt ssl,     SMTP Server Username    If your SMTP server requires a username for authentication, you should  set it here. This will get used to authenticate with your server on  connection. You may also set the password value below this one.    username gt ,     SMTP Server Password    Here you may set the password required by your SMTP server to send out  messages from your application. This will be given to the server on  connection so that the application will be able to send messages.    password gt ,     Sendmail System Path    When using the sendmail driver to send emails, we will need to know  the path to where Sendmail lives on this server. A default path has  been provided here, which will work well on most of your systems.    sendmail gt usrsbinsendmail,     Mail Pretend    When this option is enabled, email will not actually be sent over the  web and will instead be written to your applications logs files so  you may inspect the message.

Negative 2370 pI need to implement strongUndo  Redostrong functionality using strongOpenLayers 3strong vector editing just like demonstrated in a hrefhttpdev.openlayers.orgexamplesmodifyfeature.htmlhttpdev.openlayers.orgexamplesmodifyfeature.htmla for OpenLayers 2.p  pTo keep track of emgeometryem changes of emfeaturesem, I have to manage a memory stack that will hold changed geometric definitions of features upon user interactions. I know OpenLayers 3 provides observable objects. So codeol.Featurecode or codeol.Feature.getGeometrycode can be observed for changes, but I am looking for explicit events emitted by codeol.interaction.Modifycode, that should notify me when the eminteractionem starts or ends the vector editing operation just like codebeforefeaturemodifiedcode and codefeaturemodifiedcode events in OpenLayers 2.p  pA handler listening for observed emgeometryem or emfeatureem changes can be used for the purpose but it is too expensive because emgeometryem of the feature under modification is changed with every pixel move.p  pI have gone through the official a hrefhttpopenlayers.orgenv3.0.0apidocdocumentationa of OpenLayers 3 but couldnt find various events that are provided by OpenLayers 2. In most cases the documentation mentions emchangeem event only. I wonder if such events are not a consideration for Openlayer 3s architecture. If it is so, any suggestions how can I extend the existing codeol.interaction.Modifycode to incorporate custom events thanks.p

If I select emInvert Call Treeem in an attempt to see where codeobjmsgSendcode is used the most, it shows methods from near the top of the call tree, which doesnt make sense, since methods farther down in the call tree must be calling codeobjmsgSendcode more often. Unless, of course, codeobjmsgSendcode is being attributed with the cost of all of the functionality it in turn calls. In which case, Im back to the question of getting codeTime Profilercode tell me where codeobjmsgSendcode is delegating to.p

Negative 2370 pI need help to map requests for vBulletin posts to their new location on a Drupal 7 forum.p  pI inherited a Drupal site after it was migrated from Drupal 5 with vBulletin, to Drupal 7 with native Drupal Forum  Advanced Forum. The new sit also uses PathAuto.p  pEvery day I get many http requests using the old D5vBulletin URL scheme, and there is no mapping in place to rewrite the target.p  pI believe I can use Apache modrewrite or Drupal Global Redirect to handle this, if I can map the old system to the new one.p  pFor requests for thread, e.g. codeexample.comforumsshowthread.phpt1code it seems possible to map, because the Drupal 7 path alias to the node for the thread has already been created using the existing nodes title. So I can look up in the vBulletin database the old node title using the incoming querys t argument, edit that string according to the PathAuto settings in use on the new system, and create a URL alias. [Would love to know if theres a better way.]p  pBut for incoming requests for post, e.g. codeexample.comcodeI cant see how to do it. The vBulletin database has the posts in the post table, but in Drupal 7 Forum anything after the initial post is a comment and has not had a URL alias created for it because it doesnt have a title in vBulletin in most cases.p  pI suppose I could find the thread that the post belonged to and redirect the user to the top of the thread, as a workaround, but Id like to have an accurate map.p  pPlease any solutions for this p

Negative 2370 pAt a current client, the architect is insisting on using codeXmlSerializercode and its associated attributes to serialize an object model to XML which will ultimately form the basis of a file format. p  pI am dead against this approach. Bear in mind that this clients staff are not highly skilled developers and the contractors were brought in specifically to implement best practices and design principles as its a Greenfield implementation. I have been struggling to construct the arguments, until I decided to go back to base principles i.e. SOLID.p  pstrongReason 1 XmlSerializer violates Single Responsibility Principlestrongp  pWhen I create a model object for my object model i.e. class Person, I can describe the class as follows p  blockquote   pPerson class describes the attributes and properties of a Person within the system.p blockquote  pOnce I add the codeXmlSerializercode attributes, the description becomes p  blockquote   pPerson class describes the attributes and properties of a Person within the system strongandstrong   how those attributes and properties are serialized to XML.p blockquote  pNote the strongandstrong. Thus, violating strongSingle Responsility Principlestrong.p  pstrongReason 2 Over the longterm, codeXmlSerializercode results in classes that violate the Interface Segregation Principlestrongp  pAs this is a file format, the one thing that is guaranteed over time is that file formats change and migration needs to occur  codeXmlSerializercode is supremely stubborn in terms of it speaks one XML schema based on its attributes and that is it. Adding attributes like codeObsoleteAnnotationcode while it does not stop a normal developer from using that particular attribute, does stop the codeXmlSerializercode from serializing values tofrom that property basically acting like a de facto codeXmlIgnoreAttributecode. p  pThis is where an codeXmlReadercode or even codeLINQtoXMLcode serialization implementation would save massive amounts of effort for the developers in terms of longterm maintenanceenhancement, despite the initial development effort and maintains the strongInterface Segregation Principlestrong because codeXmlSerializercode forces the developer to keep propertiesattributes around in class interfaces that they do not use, in order to migrate from one version of a file format to another.p  pstrongNotestrong I am NOT saying that use of codeXmlSerializercode everywhere strongisstrong necessarily bad design tho the strongSRPstrong argument holds true for all implementations, only in the situation where interfaces are changing i.e. for a file format.p  pKeeping strictly to the application of SOLID principles to a changing file format and using codeXmlSerializercode as the serialization technology  is my analysis of the application of SOLID principles correctp

Negative 2370 pI am currently developing a strongC applicationstrong that uses strongtwo separate threadsstrong, the first is the strongmain threadstrong which the program operates on and the second is the stronglog threadstrong. The log thread is basically a strongloop that runs every second or sostrong and breaks only when the application is being closed.p  pBasically, every second or so, the log thread writes to a log file text file if there are messages to output. My problem is, on the main thread I have a move function which can change the path to the log file and other files and it moves the old files to the new location. My problem is, what happens if the log thread is writing to the log file and the move function tries to move the file or vice versa And how would I help prevent this from happeningp  pThe program runs fine if I dont change the save path but I am worried that the main thread and log thread may become deadlocked if they both try to do something to the log file at the same time. Ive done some research into this but all I can come up with are ways to stop multiple threads from readingwriting to a file at the same time, not moving the file and writing to it like I am. So really, is there some way that the log thread can tell the main thread it is using the log file and the main thread can use the log file when it is done or vice versap  pMulti threading is something I have always wanted to try but was always put off by the complexity of things like this. It certainly requires much more logic to stop things from going wrong.p  pHelp would be greatly appreciated as this is one of the last things that the application needs in order to prevent massive errors at least that I can tell, thats what testing is for really.p  pEdit What I am really looking for is strongsome way that the two threads can communicate to tell each other when they are accessing the log filestrong so that they dont try to access the same file at the same time.p

Negative 2370 pI have a 3D model that Im using as terrain. My current method of terrain collision is using gradients to find the Y value of the triangle based on the players x and z values.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comntrk0.png altDemonstrationp  pThis is an example of the top down view of an example triangle thats part of the terrain.p  pI get the gradients of p1 and p2 and use that to find the XYZ values for T1. Then I get the gradients of p1 and p3 and use that to find the XYZ values of T2. I then use T1 and T2 to get the gradient for that and as I know the X and Z values for P4, I use the gradient of T1 and T2 to get the Y value of P4. P4 is the players position but with the Y on the triangle plane.p  pAfter getting the Y value of the specific point on the triangle plane, I set the players Y position to that Y value.p  pThis worked for some triangles on the computer and on paper however there are some issues.p  ul liIt doesnt work with right angled triangles If P1 and P3 had the same X, the gradient would be infiniteli liIt doesnt work when some of the triangles and facing different directions.

Negative 2370 pIm having serious trouble trying to include javascript in a Partial View with asp mvc 4, reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14491801howdoesmvc4optimizationallowpartialviewscriptsthis posta I followed the instructions to create a custom Html helper to include the js. Unfortunately, either I call it from the layout, and then the method to actually include the Javascript is never called on time meaning that the page request has already been called when I do the ajax request or I try to include it in my Partial View, but partial views seem to automatically strip down any javascript written in them. So I tried to render a standard View, but even that hasnt solved the problem. The thing is then, is it even possible to render javascript in a view called with ajax in asp mvc Has someone done it, please advice.

Negative 2370 psince I dont have many in practice programming experience, I wonder that how to design an error code of methodfunction. For example, in java there is a method  string fooint arg1, string arg2, the method return a string that can be null and it difficult to find a special string as the error code if the method can return string of any context. If the method is a RPC method, it is impossible to use exception to deal with error. So in this situation , whats the best practice to design an error code of a methodp

Negative 2370 pSuppose class Foo inherits from dict. This is convenient for a host of reasons in my application. Suppose that the members of Foo are stored as values in the underlying dict, and suppose that some of those members are arraylike specifically numpy.ndarray. I would like to simply use the built in codeeqcode from dict to do comparisons. This fails for the array like vals though, and the error msg says to consider using .all for the arrays. The obvious solution then is to override codeeqcode and write separate comparisons for each value. This makes me twitch Is there a more elegant solutionp

Negative 2370 pI am making a railway reservation system in which I want the user to see his booking history.  In the reservation system  there is multiple login facility . Many users can create account and book tickets  . So, a user can check his bookings which were made from his account . Due to this reason , I thought that I should compare the username of the currently opened account with the account username column present in the database .  If the username of the currently opened account matches with the account username in the database , then it will fetch all those records under that name but when I try to execute, it gives me an error.p  precodeImports System.Data.OleDb  Public Class Form12         Dim connString As String  ProviderMicrosoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 Data SourceCUsersAMENDocumentsRailway.accdb     Dim MyConn As OleDbConnection     Dim da As OleDbDataAdapter     Dim ds As DataSet     Dim tables As DataTableCollection     Dim source1 As New BindingSource      Private Sub Button1ClickByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Button1.Click         MyConn  New OleDbConnection         MyConn.ConnectionString  connString         ds  New DataSet         tables  ds.Tables         da  New OleDbDataAdapterSelect [T.Tnumber], [T.PName], [T.Age],[T.TrainName], [T.SeatNo], [T.Berth],[t.RName], [t.StartingPoint],[t.Destination], [t.Departure], [t.Arrival], [t.Fare] from Table2 ,Table1 where T.PNRNumbert.PNRNumber and T.AccountUserMy.Settings.Username, MyConn         da.Fillds, Table2         Dim view As New DataViewtables0         source1.DataSource  view         DataGridView1.DataSource  view     End Sub End Class codepre  pI think something is wrong with da.Fillds, Table2 but I dont know how to correct it.p

Negative 2370 pSo either I am missing something stupidly simple or this is the weirdest bug Ive encountered in a long time.p  pThis is my applicationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRfF4o.jpg altBasic Screen Layoutp  pThe user can add a New TestStep by clicking the Add Step button in the lower left. Each TestStep in this case three are their own selfcontained UserControls that are added to a transparent stackpanel. Double clicking on a step will allow the user to edit like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwbOmo.jpg altBasic Selectionp  pSo far so good This is where it gets weird, if I select any step other than the last step at the bottom of the panel 3 in this case I get thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtArQm.jpg altenter image description herep  pEverything works emexceptem the codeSelectAllcode functionality.p  pThe little arrow to the left of the Add Step button allows the user to adjust the order of the TestSteps by moving the selected step up one. When reordering, I remove the selected step and then do an insert one index above which effectively makes it swap places with the TestStep above it.  The reason I point this out is because the codeSelectAllcode problem remains the same. The bottom most one works, all others do not, regardless of which control was added last.p  pBelow is the code that is triggered by the codeMouseUpcode event on the UserControlp  precodecontentBox.IsHitTestVisible  true contentBox.Background  new SolidColorBrushColor.FromRgb240, 240, 240 contentBox.IsReadOnly  false contentBox.Focus contentBox.SelectAll codepre  pThis code exists within each UserControl so the codecontentBoxcode references the RichTextBox for that particular instance. Note that the codeHitTestcode, codeBackgroundcode, and codeIsReadOnlycode properties work all the time for every step.

Negative 2370 pI am writing a game in HTML5 and having problems with a piece of Javascript to do with the conversion of radians to degrees.p  pCurrently my sprite is turned when the left and right keys on the keyboard are pressedheld down.

Negative 2370 pIve spent the better part of the past couple days trying to wrap my head around recursive backtracking.  Conceptually I think I understand it, but I cant seem to implement it for things more involved than something like nqueen.  The challenge is to solve a 5x5 puzzle by filling in alphabets beginning with A and ending with Y.  Each letter must be adjacent to the letters directly before and after it diagonals count as adjacent.  p  pAdditionally,  around the edges of the puzzle are clues defining where the subsequent alphabets must be in relation to the outermost edges of the gameboard as it were.  For example, letter B must appear either horizontally or vertically B on the clue part of the board, while letter P will appear diagonally from the P on the clue part of the board, since the clue for P is in a corner. I currently have the board laid out as a 7x7 array which includes the clues on the outside to keep it organized as follows.p  precode T X Y N F E J   V 0 0 0 0 0 O   R 0 0 0 0 0 Q   L 0 0 0 0 0 C    K 0 0 0 0 0 H   G 0 0 0 0 0 I   P W U S D B M  codepre  pThe A can appear anywhere within the board the area marked with 0s.  I began with A at array[3][5] and began attempting to populate the rest of the gameboard from there.

Negative 2370 pI have 2 GCE nodes, each running the same N services. For each service, I use the GCE network load balancer to distribute requests to the 2 nodes. I therefore created the following setupp  ul liSince I want the load balancer to check the health of each service separately, I have a health check for each of the N services every health check checks a different port for an HTTP responseli liSince each service has its own health check, I have N targetpools, all of them just containing node 1 and 2, but all with a different health check.li liSince I have N target pools, I also have N forwarding rulesli liSince I want each of these load balanced services to be available externally actually, from within GAE, I assign each of the forwarding rules a static IP addressli ul  pThe problem is that I have more than 7 services I want to run, and the regional quota of GCE only allow 7 static IP addresses. This makes me suspect Im doing something wrong, and theres a better design for what Im doing.p  pThe root of my problem seems to be that I want a health check for each service instead of each node, which I can only seem to do if I split up the entire path up to the forwarding rule in the GCE network load balancer.p

Commenting out codeltDateMDYgtcode, but leaving those Literal objects in, will also issue the error.  Commenting out codeltYearLiteralgtcode does not seem to matter itll work or not work regardless  that seems to indicate that because the first two are nonterminal, I cant produce elements for them.p  pThere is clearly something Im not appreciating about how Ruby or treetop is instantiating these classes or about AST generation that would explain what happens.  Can you explain or point me to something that can help me understand why codeltMonthLiteralgtcode or codeltDayLiteralgtcode cant have objects generatedp  pstrongSecondstrong, this may be a bridge too far, but what Id really prefer would be to get a codeDateMDYcode object with three attributes  month, day, and year  so I can readily produce a Ruby codeTimecode object from a method codetotimecode in codeDateMDYcode, but right now Id settle for just producing the constituent pieces as objects.p  pSo I tried leaving codeltDateMDYgtcode as the object and commented out the references to codeltMonthLiteralgtcode, codeltDayLiteralgtcode, and codeltYearLiteralgtcode.  I saw that the resulting AST object returned from code.parsecode codetcode in my original example has two public methods  codedaypartcode and codemonthpartcode but those seem to be nil when I invoke those say, codeputs t.daypartcode and there is no codeyearpartcode method, so that didnt seem to help me out.p  pIs it possible to do somehow have codeDateMDYcode end up accessing its constituent partsp  pFYI, the codeParsercode code itself Im using is pretty standard stuff from the treetop tutorials and the codenodeextensions.rbcode that defines the object classes is also trivial, but I can post those too if you need to see those.p  pThanks Richardp

Negative 2370 pI am writing a Python code and I want to use a C function in the middle of it. Therefore, I am using CTypes to do so. The idea is that I have function func implemented in C, it receives an array of integers and returns another array of integers but it is in fact a vector in my C implementation, this is why I return a pyobject. The important part of my code is belowp  precode1   cinterface  CDLLpathcode.so 2   f  cinterface.func 3   f.argtypes  [POINTERcint] 4   f.restype  pyobject 5   r1  getFirstVector 6   r2  r1.ctypes.dataasPOINTERcint 7   F  cinterface.funcr2 8   print F codepre  pSo, in summary, in line 1 I load my C implementation, then on line 2 I just create a variable f to make it more concise. Then on line 3 I state the parameter of such function is a int since I am giving an array of integers and on line 4 I state the return type a PyObject. In Line 5 I get my first vector, from my Python code, and then I convert it to be in the proper format that is going to be used by C function Line 6. Finally I call my C function on line 7. The problem I never get to line 8, I receive the following error message p  pstrongFatal Python error PyEvalSaveThread NULL tstatestrongp  pI dont know how to solve this problem. I found a lot of references suggesting this may be a problem with Pythons GIL, but I do not know how to solve this issue. What am I doing wrongp  pMy C implementation is ok, because I was able to see it reaches the return statement, so it seems the problem is the CPython transition.p  pFor the records, my C implementation looks like thisp  precodeextern C      PyObject funcint vec         PyObject toReturn  PyListNew0          vectorltintgt temp         vectorltintgtamp t  temp         obtainNewVectorcvec, t         Iterate over new vector, filling the new values         vectorltboolgt vecc1024, 0         forunsigned int i  0 i lt t.size i             vecc[t[i]]  1                   forunsigned int i  0 i lt vecc.size i             PyListAppendtoReturn, PyLongFromLonglongvecc[i]                  return toReturn       codepre  pSo, the idea of this code is that it will receive a vector of integers and it will transform it in another vector via obtainNewVectorc. This new vector contains indices and each of the indices returned in this vector will be active in the vector I am returning.p  pFinally, everything I am doing is in a osX, using Python 2.7.5.p

Negative 2370 pBeen exploring the use of pouch db so we could potentially leverage its offline sync instead of doing our own. We have a cordova app that pulls data from a REST API and saves it into a web sql store. Part of this is around 5k physical locations for various stores. I timed it on the cordova app, and we download the stores amp save them, along with another request for project information in about 11 seconds. Just the saving of these 5k records as documents in pouch db takes 30 seconds.

Negative 2370 pWe are running into cases where we change a property on our entity but the codePropertyChangedcode event doesnt fire.  We are doing this logic as part of a Save and so the problem seems to be the way DevForce queues events like this during a Save.p  pLooking at the code for LoadingBlock.Dispose, I see thisp  precodepublic void Dispose      this.entityManager.FireQueuedEvents     this.entityManager.IsLoadingEntity  this.wasLoadingEntity  codepre  pThere is a race condition there that you fire the queued events before changing the codeIsLoadingEntitycode property.  That means that any new events that get generated during the FireQueuedEvents will get queued since codeIsLoadingEntitycode will still be true but events that get queued then will never get fired since we already fired the queued events that we knew about.  It seems like DevForce should reset the IsLoadingEntity flag before firing the events.  I think that would solve our problems.p  pHere is some code that might help explain our case.  Ill use a Merge call instead of SaveChanges since its easier to use in a unit testp  precodeCreate the main Entity Manager and a test entity var em  new EntityManager var entity  new MyEntity SID  123 em.AttachEntityentity  Create a second copy of the entity and another Entity Manager  this is just so    we can trigger a merge and see the bad behavior var copy  new MyEntity  SID  123, MergeCount  20  var em2  new EntityManager em2.AttachEntitycopy  This code is a bit contrived but its similar to what we are doing in our actual app em.EntityChanged  sender, args gt      If it is a MyEntity that changed and it was from a Merge, increment the MergeCount property     var e  args.Entity as MyEntity     if e  null ampamp args.Action  EntityAction.ChangeCurrentAndOriginal              e.MergeCount        Set up a PropertyChanged event handler to see what properties got changed according to INotifyPropertyChanged var propertiesChanged  new Listltstringgt entity.PropertyChanged  sender, args gt  propertiesChanged.Addargs.PropertyName   Merge the copy entity em2.CacheStateManager.GetCacheState.Mergeem, RestoreStrategy.Normal  At this point, the MergeCount property will be 21  as expected Assert.AreEqual21, entity.MergeCount  We should have seen a PropertyChanged event for MergeCount since we changed the property it was 20 and we set it to 21 Assert.IsTruepropertiesChanged.ContainsMergeCount  In the debugger, if we look at em.queuedEvents, well see some items in there.  One of the items is the PropertyChanged event   for MergeCount.  It fired but was queued...and it will be queued forever because the LoadingBlock is long gone. codepre  pIve found that I can just do another Merge from an empty Entity Manager and that will cause the previously queued events to fire.  That is an okay workaround in one case that we ran into this.  But I fear there might be other places where we are running into this issue and that workaround wont work for us.p

When I started the code, it did not crashed 1 but it did not draw anything, even when I try to hover the cursor into where the BufferedImage should be painted. Maybe I should add coderevalidatecode or coderepaintcode after calling the Overwritten codepaintgetGraphicscode inside the codestartRunningcode methodp  pEDIT4 the codewhiletruecode that the code is actually in may be the problem but when I use a SwingTimer it gets out of sync with the client and crashes after first cycle. Any alternatives to thisp

Negative 2370 pIm attempting to modify an image carousel Ive created initially just to have four pictures. The way mine is setup is one large image and then under it four thumbnail images. I had previous and next buttons to navigate through the images on the large image. I realized I will need more images than four sometimes, so I want the option to add more in and an extra navigation arrow to the thumbnail part so I can click the arrow and it hide the first four thumbnails and show the next set.p  pI modified mine and I added in two more images for now to test this. Now the images are just plopped into place. The code I was modeling mine after wasnt this, but this is the basic functionality of what I want mine to do, but I still want the same arrows on the large picture as well. Because I already have most of it that already works, I really only want to change what I need to and I am so new to Javascript I dont even know where to start with modifying mine. Im using this.p  pAfter looking at that code, I tried adding in a limit like that had in it, but it broke my code and didnt allow me to do anything.p  pThis is what I basically have minus the arrows being so low. In my page they are right in the middle of the large image.p  pIs there anyway I can modify my existing code to have this same functionalityp  pAnother part of my question is, I will be filling the pictures with images that are in my data base. The thing is, I will not always have 6 images.. or I may have more. How can I get the image boxes to not show up if there is nothing filled in my dbp  pAs of now, I fill the images with php like this..p  precodeltphp result  mysqliquerycon,SELECT  FROM products ifrow  mysqlifetcharrayresult      products[row[productid]]  row  ifrow[image]           echo ltimg classsizedimg srcproductpics.row[img]. altProduct Picturegt   gt codepre

Negative 2370 pThe below method works...however, it only does so with timeout added to the tabList function.  The nginit is executing before the DOM renders thus the document.getElementByIds is coming back as undefined.

Negative 2370 pdear all p  pI have an two projects sharing the same program.  InApp purchase in fact, productsRequest of one app works and was approved by apple. Then apple said that the InApp purchase of the 2nd app did not work and rejected it.br That is very strange since the two app shares the same code.  Moreover, the last versions of the two app worked fine last year and I have changed the program code related to productsRequest method invocation. p  pAfter trying various solutions, I cannot sort it out. I am now trying to delete the rejected version since I suspect that something was wrong in Xcode and iTune connect.br But then iTune connect only allows me to resubmit a new build in the same rejected version number.  I cannot delete the rejected version.br I cannot add a new version either. p  pCan someone help me  Really appreciated.p

Negative 2370 pwe are new to using Hadoop and storing data within HDFS. We have done some basic stuff, but now we want to try more complex data types. p  pWe have a parser that takes in a binary input and transforms the data into human readable. The binary files can have an arbitrary start and stop time. Some can go for 2 minutes, others can run for 30 minutes. We only care about sensortype, timestamp, value. The data is output into a Text CSV file in the following structure SerialNumber, SensorType, Timestamp, Value.... I want to take those rows and do something like thisp  pSerial, SensorType, Timestart, Time Stop, Array[value]p  pI want to test this type of data type so that it isnt creating so many rows per time. The problem is that the timestamps for that serial, sensor combination could be spread across thousands of files. Whats the best way into hadoop to get all those values into one array Would this be a MR type program Im really not sure how to go about this.p  pThen if I can get it into this type of structure is it possible to get the flat records so that they are stored in the array in the order they were takenp  pExample t1  1.0, t2  1.1, t3  1.05, t4  1.0 will be stored as [1.0, 1.1, 1.05, 1.0] p  pThank you,p

Negative 2370 pIn my web application which is using ASP.net framework I am noticing an infrequent behavior There is a significantly huge 300ms to 500ms delay between the HTTP post header packet being sent and HTTP post body packets being sent.

Is it a good idea, or should I create one more level of abstractionp  pFor example I noticed doubleclicking the files allows me to rename them, just like in windows Explorer. The question here, of course, is whether this is modular or somewhat hardcoded... Also file APIs may differ, so I need to know whether the abstraction is sufficient to deal with systems that dont allow certain operations, or allow special ones.p

Negative 2370 pI am creating a MSword file using codePHPDOCXcode. The below code creates a MSword file. As you can see the textboxes does not have equal spacing at the bottom. I have figured out the cause of this problem that if the height of the textbox changes it occupies the space below it. Each textbox starts from the next line and has a fixed spaces to the next line so it happens, if the other textbox is bigger it occupy the other spaces and 4th textbox overlap the 5th textbox. What I want to that each textbox should have equal spacing regardless to its height.p  pAction position static this creates the textboxes has an equal spacing but the indention of textboxes are broken.

Negative 2370 pIm trying to write a Pascal LazarusFPC program that is started by another program as a process. The caller the Arena chess GUI talks to my program using StdIn and StdOut.p  pFirst I used READLN in my program to get the text commands sent from the GUI and WRITELN to reply to them. That worked well except that my program would stop doing anything if the READLN had to wait for input from the GUI. Since I wanted the program to carry on working and only deal with commands as they arrived I had to change this.p  pSo I changed the code to usep  precode... var   inpStream         TInputPipeStream ... inpStream  TInputPipeStream.CreateStdInputHandle ... if inpStream.NumBytesAvailable gt 0 then begin     SetLengthsbuffer, inpStream.NumBytesAvailable     inpStream.Readsbuffer[1], lengthsbuffer end ... codepre  pThat worked really well as it no longer paused for the read. But then the WRITELN stopped working nothing gets sent back to the GUI. I thought maybe this would helpp  precode... var inpStream         TInputPipeStream     outStream         TOutputPipeStream ... inpStream  TInputPipeStream.CreateStdInputHandle outStream  TOutputPipeStream.CreateStdOutputHandle ... if inpStream.NumBytesAvailable gt 0 then begin     SetLengthsbuffer, inpStream.NumBytesAvailable     inpStream.Readsbuffer[1], lengthsbuffer end ... outStream.Writesbuffer, lengthsbuffer codepre  pBut that makes it worse as now it doesnt read or write anything.
