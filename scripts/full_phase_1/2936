For example, this is found in the first worksheet called rawp  pre    Column E   Column F   Column G  Column H  Column Z   Column AA  Column AB    Product ID       xx          xx           xx       USD Price    SGD Price    HKD price       S123          xx          xx           xx         1.12345    1.46786     1.8908       S124          xx          xx           xx         2.12345    2.5331      2.8428       pre  pWhile this can be found in the second worksheet tablep  pre    Column H   Column I   Column J  Column K  Column S   Column T  Column U    Product ID       xx          xx           xx       USD Price    SGD Price    HKD price       S123          xx          xx           xx         1.12346    1.46786    1.8910       S124          xx          xx           xx         2.12345    2.5351     2.8428 pre  pIt should match the product ID and compare columns Z, AA, AB in raw worksheet with columns S,T,U in table worksheet and copy the entire row into a different worksheet, named Mismatch. It should also be able to highlight the field that is different in the two worksheet. So in this case, it should copy the entire S123 and S124 row, highlight the cell 1.12346, 1.8910 and 2.5351 in red.p  pMy existing code now only compares a single column and copies the row into the Mismatch worksheet, in this case columns Z and S.

This site is currently and older site which some friends and I started in middle school and still use today.  I may or may not register it to be a NonProfit Organization in the near future, but either way, a CA costs money and the organization doesnt have any and we are currently college kids.p  pVerisign is unreasonable and GoDaddy is 30year.  GoDaddy isnt too unreasonable, and I think their certs are accepted by most web browsers. The thing with GoDaddy is that I dont know why they have different SSL products i.e. why is it cheap to not verify me  does this have any implications on the cert and how the browser treats it if it just contains a domain namep  pAlso, is there an issue with using my own cert  Could the login page be http, and have a line stating that I use a selfsigned cert and here is its fingerprint and then post the form to an https page  Safaris method isnt too bad or sound too scary.  Im afraid, however, that firefox 3s method will scare people away and give me a tonne of emails saying that my site is being hacked or something. I dont know how IE responds to selfsigned certs. There is also the issue of why pay for something I can create myself with no effort, but Im not going to pose the philosophical part of it, this is a more practical question.p  pIn sum, do I give GoDaddy 30 a year or do I just tell people in a small paragraph what Im doing and give the few people that will actually want my fingerprint itp  pEdit Some on a forum I was reading for more info mentioned that GoDaddy certs are only given if its on a GoDaddy server, which this isnt. Two things 1 is this true and There are other CAs at about the same price, so the argument should still be the same.p

Negative 2936 pDoes anyone know of a ORM tool for .Net that will work on a database with no primary keys defined  We are running MS SQL Server 2005 by the way.p  pI cannot change the DB schema and add primary keys  the DB is the of our ERP system and their business logic is aware of what would make a table nonsensical.  p  pFor example, it would make sense for the Customer table to have a primary key on the field CustomerNumber.

Negative 2936 pIve been reading about Azures Access Control Service and claimsbased authorization in general for a while now, and for whatever reason, I still dont see the rationale behind moving from rolepermissionbased authorization to a claimsbased model. The models seem similar to me and they probably are, except that the list of what the client can and cant do comes from a third party and is wrapped up in some sort of token, instead of from some sort of database that the server has to query. Whats the advantage of getting a third party the token issuer involvedp  pI fully understand the advantages of outsourcing authentication to a third party. It allows apps to not have to create new users all the time, worry about storing passwords, etc. when they can just push that off to some other service that already has the infrastructure set up. Its essentially the DRY principle for authentication. p  pHowever, in my mind, that same logic doesnt work for authorization. Each app has its own resources it has to protect, and therefore its own rules for authorizing users to perform certain actions. The infrastructure seems simple enough that each app could create it on its own a table mapping users to roles, and possibly another mapping roles to permissions, and even if you wanted to outsource it, it seems that the claimsbased model is doing something more complicated than that.p  pThe only partial explanation Ive seen comes from a hrefhttpwww.theserverside.netttarticlesshowarticle.tssidClaimsBasedSecurityModelBuilding a ClaimsBased Security Model in WCFa, and it gives two main advantages to claimsbased auth more flexibility, and someone to vouch that the information in a claim is correct. When would you need either of thosep  pClaimsbased authorization seems to be gaining popularity, so I assume there must be some good rationale for it I just havent figured out what that is yet. Can someone please provide a concrete example of a situation where claimsbased auth works better than rolebased, and why it works better in that casep  pEDIT I missed a third benefit listed in the article supporting single signonfederation. But doesnt authentication deal with that on its own without getting authorization involvedp

Negative 2936 pI am about to attempt reorganizing the way my group builds a set of large applications that share about 90 of their source files.  Right now, these applications are built without any libraries whatsoever involved except for externally linked ones that are not under our control.  The applications use the same common source files we are not maintaining 5 versions of the same .h.cpp files, but these are not built into any common library.  So, at the moment, we are paying the price of building the same code overandover per application, each time we intend to release a version.  To me, this sounds like a prime candidate for using libraries to capture the shared code and reduce build times.  I do not have the option of using DLLs, so the approach is to use static libraries.p  pI would like to know what tips you would have for how to approach this task.  I have limited experience with creatingorganizing static libraries, so even the basic suggestions towards organizationgotchas are welcome.  Maybe even a good book recommendationp  pI have done a brief exercise by finding the entire subset of files that each application share in common.  As a proof of concept, I took these files and placed them in a single Common Monster static library.  Building the full application using this single static library certainly improves the build time for all of the applications, but should I leave it at this  The purpose of the library in this form is not very focused and seems like a lazy attempt at modularity.  There is ongoing development with these applications, and Im afraid this setup will cause problems further down the line.p

Negative 2936 pI have an activeX control that contains one window that has streaming video being drawn to it.   I have a separate dialog that I create in another window that I have made transparent or semitransparent in various ways i.e. using the SetLayeredWindowAttributes... along with the Layered property [for alpha blending] of the dialog or setting the transparent property.p  pAdditionally Ive tried to use various methods to attempt to get the window for the dialog to always draw on top of the streaming video window but none have proved to work for me.  If I have a button on the dialog or draw on the transparent surface with LineTo... calls they dont remain on top of the video.  I have tried to use SetWindowPos to affect the zorder of the two windows and also tried to change the dialog window properties such as TopMost but with no avail.p  pHas anyone tried to do something like this for an overlaid window over streaming video and gotten the zordering to work at painting the front window always after the streaming videop  pUPDATE 021010  tried using WSEXLAYERED property with SetLayeredWindowAttributes... using LWACOLORKEY and achieved what I was looking for.  Since layered property cannot be used with WSCHILD style this solution brings with it some required management of the overlay window position with respect to the window with video.  Additionally there are some other oddities I am trying to eliminate.  For instance, when activeX control window with video is embedded in an IE tab and I switch to another tab controls on the overlay window remain on top the new tab when WSPOPUP style used.  Still investigating if there will be alternative means of dealing with this other then determining the switch and hiding the window visability.p

Negative 2936 pI cant svn up or commit. p  pThere is a svn centrally and I use git locally using gitsvn.p  pBasically, somehow, I added a folder that had .svn folders into the git and committed it to svn. Both git and central svn happily committed the .svn as the content folder, without complaining.p  pNow, I cant svn up to the existing folder as, once a folder is created, .svn is automatically added and it complains, there is an unversioned .svn within the folder. For the same reason I cannot even clone the svn repo again. The clone stops at that particular point, infinitely.p  pI cant svn commit because the working copy within .svn content folder doesnt exist.p  pBecause codegitsvncode was able to put the .svn inside the svn, it should be able to remove it, I thought. I earlier renamed this folder and committed, so now the git thinks there is no such folder, whereas the svn shows 2 folders one of them with the old .svn folders. So, git cannot exactly delete this folder either.p  pWhat is the way to remove the .svn out of the central svn repo.p  pI tried to reverse merge the commit that introduced .svn within the svn.

Negative 2936 pFairly new to Java, but Im wondering why package access is considered more restrictive than subclass access. That is, every access modifier which provides subclasses with access to a member also provides the whole package with access, and there are modifiers whic provide package access but not subclass access.p  pIsnt this totally backwards Lets say I have a class ControlledInstantiation in some package. If I have another class AlsoControlledInstantiation extends ControlledInstantiation, I am unable to call the constructor of ControlledInstantiation unless I set it to protected or public. And if I set it to protected, now any other class in the package can instantiate it as often as it likes. So something which is obliged to be substitutable for its superclass and, syntactically, is gets the same or less access to the superclass than something which serves a distinct but related function. Its like telling your child he cant play with your wallet because you wouldnt let your neighbours do it and then letting your neighbours sleep in your house because your kid does.p  pSo I guess Im asking, what motivated this decision, and how can I get around itp

Negative 2936 pI need to store basic objects with a maximum of 5 properites in each object when my application is closed or deactivated. Now I understand the event handlers we have available to us but Im not so sure about how to go about saving the objects so that they can be called later.p  pMy original thought was to store the objects to an xml file in isolated storage and just simply read the xml file when the app was open again and reload all objects as needed. But I keep hearing about serialization when it comes to tombstoning.p  pNow this raises some questionsp  p1. Is serialization better to use than saving to an xml file in this scenariop  p2. What are the differences between doing one over the other if both store data to be called at a later timep  p3.

Negative 2936 pIm thinking of login forms in particularp  pBy their nature, login forms block action on arbitrary input  without a valid username and password, you just get bounced. Is there a reason why these even need the addition of codeauthenticitytokencode or similar crosssite request forgery protection at allp  pIm curious if login forms are one example where CSRF might even be generally undesirablep  pGiven an anonymous client, it should be allowed that the first point of contact with a site is to POST valid login credentials. CSRF prevents this direct interaction by first requiring that the client perform a GET to establish an anonymous session cookie, which is used as the basis for their authenticitytoken. The token must then be posted back with the login credentials. The extra upfront step seems pointless when the actual goal here is to authenticate a user who arrives without a session and is trying to give their credentials.p  pAm I missing some security consideration in this scenariop
Negative 2936 pIm new to the Lift framework, and for the past couple of days Ive been playing around with the Flot widget.  I really like the fact that I have a facade to the Flot javascript written in Scala.  However, I ran into some issues when I tried to add more interactive features to the graph.p  pWhat Im attempting to do is allow the user to zoom in on datapoints in the graph.  Basically Im trying to accomplish this example, but in lift  a hrefhttppeople.iola.dkolauflotexampleszooming.html relnofollowhttppeople.iola.dkolauflotexampleszooming.htmla.p  pThe meat of the zoom is handled by this javascript p  precode placeholder.bindplotselected, function event, ranges       do some checks on the ranges...       do the zooming     .plotplaceholder, getData...,                   .extendtrue, , options,                        xaxis  min ranges.xaxis.from, max ranges.xaxis.to ,                       yaxis  min ranges.yaxis.from, max ranges.yaxis.to                     codepre  pWhats the best way to do this in Lift  In the code above Im generating the plot in purejavascript, but the flotwidget is supposed to do this for me.  It seems incorrect to have that code twice, once using the Flotwidget and once again here in raw javascript.  Im not sure if I should move the chunk of code above into Scala.  Futhermore, I havent found any documentation on how to do a jQuery bind in the Scala DSL.  Any helpadvice would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp  pOne final niggle... The jquery.flot.selection plugin is required to do zooming, so I had to add that into my Lift project manually.  Thats fine, except that the jquery.flot.js is builtin automatically.  When I added the flot.selection plugin, my plugin version was too new for the jquery.flot.js included with Lift.  I had to go spelunking through the jars to figure out which version of the selection plugin I needed.  p  pIve gotten burned by maven quite a number of times where one library included another library automatically for me...I realize JavaScript may be different but Im still gunshy when it comes to libraries including other libraries.p  pOkay...Ill stop ranting now  Thanks again for the help.p

Negative 2936 pI have a project in Eclipse that currently has no ANT build file, but is about to have one created to facilitate building jars.  Id like to write the build file so that it would work for both.  I was just going to write the full build in ANT but I noticed this line in a hrefhttphelp.eclipse.orgheliosindex.jsptopicorg.eclipse.platform.doc.usergettingStartedqs81basics.htm relnofollowan IBM Help doca.p  blockquote   pThe Java builder runs the internal   Eclipse Java compiler which in turn is   responsible for indexing your source   so that searching, refactoring and   many other features are available.   Thus it is not possible to replace the   internal Eclipse Java compiler by   using a project builder. You can   disable the Java builder and you can   control when the Java Builder runs   with respect to the project builders   that you define.p blockquote  pDo I need to write the ANT file so that it conditionally compiles codejavaccode only outside Eclipse  Are there other things I need to do to make ANT and Eclipse play nicely togetherp

Negative 2936 pIn Java, everytime I want to create a new custom event, I usually do it by add 3 methods namely p  precodeaddDogEventListenerEventListener listener  removeDogEventListenerEventListener listener dispatchDogEventListenerDogEvent event codepre  pThen now if I want to dispatch another event, say CatEvent, I will have to create all these 3 methods againp  precodeaddCatEventListenerEventListener listener  removeCatEventListenerEventListener listener dispatchCatEventListenerCatEvent event codepre  pThen if I want to manage just one kind of CatEvent event, say Meow, I have to copy and paste all these 3 methods again Like addCatMeowEventListener... etcp  pAnd usually, I need to dispatch more than one kind of events.

Negative 2936 pThe requirement is to display all public content and all content that has been restricted to the viewers region. p  pCurrently this is being accomplished by producing two views in blocks on a standard page.   One view is set up to display all news articles that do not have a N in a restrict to region field.  Another view is set up to display all news articles that have a Y in a restrict to region field AND uses php code in a contextual filter to add the condition that the region field in the news article matches the region field in the user profile.  Stacking these views in the content field of a standard page results in a page that returns all news articles that are not restricted AND all news articles that are restricted to the users region.p  pUndesirable complications of this strategy include separate pagination and the necessity of creating multiple views to extend the functionality to additional content types or to expand to cities or states.p  pCan you think of a way to apply the complex filter on a single view so as to avoid the need for presenting a separate unrestricted view followed by a view restricted to records whos region matches the viewers region   p  pOr to apply the filter as a permission on fieldsp  pThanks n advance,p

If you ideas for how to properly match the strings below without using recursive php regex, thats very cool, but thats not the question.p  precodeaRaa codepre  pThis is a simple expression that aims to match the character a or nothing, nested in one or multiple nests of the character a. For instance, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa. You dont need to use recursion for this p  precodeaaa codepre  pwould work great. But the point is to use recursion.p  pHere is a piece of code you can run to test my failing patternp  precodeltphp triesarraya,aa,aaa,aaaa,aaaaa,aaaaaa regexaRaa foreach tries as try  echo try.   if pregmatchregex,try,hit echo hit[0].ltbr gt else echo no matchltbr gt  gt codepre  pIn the pattern, two as are framing an alternation.

I dont think this is at issue because the working methods without the like statement are padded as well.  IF this is at issue, I dont know how to change the behavior since the table adapter creates this query in cohort with SQL.p  pBI CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHY THE ABOVE METHOD FAILSB  Executing it directly in sql in this format returns an empty recordset with our without padding spaces.  There are 11 records in my table that return with this WORKING queryp  precodeSELECT  CLLName, CLFName, MEDRECNO, CLSEX, CLDOB, RACECode FROM dbo.Clients WHERE MEDRECNO LIKE 2222 ORDER BY CLLName, CLFName codepre  p...which is the above sql trace transformed into the actual statement without params and with the identical selection criteria.p  pThe second solution that fails for me is thisp  pTable Adapater Queryp  precodeSELECT CLLName, CLFName, MEDRECNO, CLSEX, CLDOB, RACECode FROM dbo.Clients WHERE MEDRECNO LIKE      ORDER BY CLLName, CLFName codepre  pWhile this does NOT work when calling the method from code, when editing the statement via the DataSet Designer, if I click the QUERY BUILDER and test it it prompts for the parameter it will return the desired set of records.p  pC portionp  precodeclientsTableAdapter.FillByMRNclinicalSystemDataSet.Clients, searchStr codepre  pThis returns NO results and a SQL trace showsp  precodeexec spexecutesql NSELECT CLLName, CLFName, MEDRECNO, CLSEX, CLDOB, RACECode FROM dbo.Clients WHERE MEDRECNO LIKE   P1   ORDER BY CLLName, CLFName, NP1 char1024, 2222 codepre  pAgain the 2222 is padded out to 1024 characters.

Negative 2936 pI have a set of data from a table codeTableAcode which relates to itself through codeTableBcode. Parents in codeTableAcode have children in codeTableAcode. Those children might also have children. Nothing amazing here.p  pI have a toplevel set of rows from codeTableAcode that I need to operate on. Before I can operate on those rows, I must have each child row on hand. I must be able to operate on each toplevel row of codeTableAcode and its children as fast as possible in my application.p  pI cant find a way to do this.p  pUsing a recursive CTE codeTableAcode toplevel set as anchor, codeTableBgtTableAcode join as union, does not fulfill the requirements. The entire toplevel set from codeTableAcode is returned in the CTE before it works on level 2 of the children. Then it works on level 3. Then level 4, etc. Since my toplevel set is some 400,000 plus rows, my client application cannot begin working on rows until the ENTIRE dataset has been batched up on the server.p  pI need a better way to do this. Ive tried streaming a flat set of toplevel codeTableAcode rows to the client, and having the client issue the recursive CTE statement repeatedly for each toplevel codeTableAcode row. This actually works. But theres too much noise. The sustained row retrieval rate is too large due to the repeated reissuing of statements. p  pI need a creative solution.p  pSnippet of the perrecord CTE Im using.

Negative 2936 pI am working on an application with a rather complex layout structure. I plan on using Kendo UI for my JavaScript component needs. My challenge right now is, layout though. Im not sure if there is a CSS framework thats recommended or a JavaScript framework.

Negative 2936 pI never know how to correctly model situations when theres this data structure that Ill want to later save on disk. p  pFor instance, Im currently working on a small codegenerator. The general idea is that Ill somewhere want to store both a class qualified name as well as its related contents, and Ill later want to save the .java file to disk and to compile it via codejavaccode. Its not entirely clear that Ill want to do both actions, that is, saving to disk as .java and compiling via codejavaccode as just one action. I guess sometimes I might want to just write the .java file to disk without compiling.p  precodeclass CompilationUnit      String qualifiedName     String contents  codepre  pNow, my question is on how to model this. Should I have a codeCompilationUnitcode that takes as arguments both an codeIFileSystemcode and codeIJavaCompilercode, so every time I have in my hand a codeCompilationUnitcode I have everything needed to do both actions, or should I try to keep that compilation logic outside of the class, being a codeCompilationUnitcode just a data objectp  pOne one hand, theres this OO belief one should keep both state and behaviour on the same object, which would favor keeping the qualified name and its contents together with the possibility of writing the compilation unit to disk and compile it.p  pDespite of that fact, I cannot but feel uncomfortable with the idea of having the codeCompilationUnitcode taking both codeIFileSystemcode and codeIJavaCompilercode dependencies, although I its a bit hard to explain why it is so. p  pMy idealist intuition is that a data object should be easy to instantiate, and in that view it cannot but feel awkward to have to pass in a codeIFileSystemcode and codeIJavaCompilercode every time I want to store a qualified name and its contents together. This means that whoever is in charge of generating this data has to also have access to both codeIFileSystemcode and codeIJavaCompilercode, which is kind of odd.p  pIm not sure Ive actually answered my own question or not.p  pThis system will be tested, so a correct handling of dependencies issues is paramount.p  pThanksp

However, I cant seem to find a way to get access to the underlying thread.

Negative 2936 pI am presuming that GWT RPC actually uses RequestBuilder.p  pIs there a way to extract the RequestBuilder instance used by my RPC service async requestorp  pActually, my question is, how do you extract the RequestBuilder instance to insert the authentication token as a http header Is there a way to insert http headers into an RPC service requestp  pEven if I could insert a http header into the request, how then would the remote servlet be told to expect that auth token Therefore, in fact, does GWT RPC provide a framework for secure authentication at allp  pI am thinking the answer is NO, or at least not in a convenient way. Am I rightp  pI am coming from having used RestEasy in combination with RestyGWT over SSL, where we can insert headers anytime we wish. BTW, RestyGWT constructs its request to use RequestBuilder.p  pMy actual motivation is comparing the security effectiveness between GWT RPC and GWT JAXRS RestyGWT  RestEasy. So if you, as the answerer, have an alternative detailed discourse comparing the security effectiveness of RPC with direct use of RequestBuilder or REST rather than answering this question directly please feel free to elaborate.p  pAm I right to presume that GWT RPC is not security friendlyeffective and I should avoid using GWT RPC for secure authenticated requestsp

Negative 2936 pI am using rails code to populate some html and JS code into mysql DB. The code is then fetched from DB and rendered on a configurable page. In the HAML file, When I use ruby code in a JS alert it works finep  palertuser.idp  pthe id is displayed because I pass the user object to this page.  Now when I save this line alertuser.id in DB and render the JS code, it alerts user.id as a string. How do I make it realize that the string coming from DB is not just a string, it is some ruby code which needs to be interpreted on the page as I am getting the user object there. So it should display the actual id like 5 or 6 instead of showing a simple string user.idp  pPlz helpp

Negative 2936 pI have created a simple Office Com addin which is used among other PowerPoint addins on my company computers. Every time PowerPoint starts an AccessViolationException occurs as soon as I am accessing the windows count property in AfterPresentationOpen event please see code below.p  pIn order to narrow down the issue I created two blank addin solution Office COM and VSTO addin. I placed a breakpoint in AfterPresentationOpen method and every time the breakpoint is hit on a thread called VSTAMain and throws this exception. Furthermore my try catch block does not catch this exception. As soon as I disable a specific third party addin everything works like a charm and the breakpoint is hit on the Main thread and I can read the count property.p  pI am using Windows 7 and Office 2010 both are x64.

Negative 2936 pI have started trying to create normal MVC Swing components. I have no problems with M and C, but V had thrown at me one problem which I cannot normally solve. The problem is Controller is main class of the component MyComponent, for example, and it extends JComponent. View is ui delegate MyCompanentUI extended from ComponentUI class. All what delegate does is adds JTextField in MyCompanent and provides data binding between MyComponentModel and this field. It works just fine. But how I can bind events from JTextField to MyComponent If user wants to handle some events he adds listeners to MyComponent, but all real events mouse, focus, keys, etc. intercepted by JTextField, about which user does not really knows. So is there any normal way to do this, except catching events and translate it to original component by hands Or is there another way to create delegate and I just really do it all wrongp  pUPDp  pThanks for your response, trashgod. But I had something different in my mind. I was talking about something like events inheritance, like in the case of inheritsPopupMenu method. So that then key, focus or mouse event happens to the component one does not process it itself, but directly transfer it to parent component.

Negative 2936 pI have a C class library which references a WCF service. This creates the service settings in the app.config. When I build the app, the settings are in the appname.dll.config correctly. However, when the setup application creates the setup.exe and I install this on another machine, the config file in there is missing the service reference. All it has is my connection string for the Entity Framework Model.p  pWhy is this happening I need the service reference settings because the machine the service runs on may change from time to time.p  pEDIT It seems noone understands the problem. My setup app installs the dll to the destination directory as well as the dll.config. I know I would then need to copy that config to the exe app but right now there isnt one. That will be up to the client on that machine to copy it from that destination folder to whatever and wherever is needed. The issue is that the dll.config does NOT include the service settings even though the app.config of the dll does and the dll.config in the release directory of the dll does too. For some reason the setup app which creates a setup.exe and is packaging the dll.config is losing this information. I hope that makes it clearer.p

Negative 2936 pI need to use a customize path for the Ext.Loader in my MVC project. Ive already looked through the API and found nothing useable.

Would that be possiblep  pThanks in advance for any suggestionsp  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe loader by default calling something like codeappcontrollerMyController.jscode or codeappstoreMyStore.jscodep  pMy goal is to modify this path like codeloaddataappcontrollerMyControllercode or better codeloaddataidentapp.controller.MyControllercode or best request via JSONp  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pThanks for all reply I looked again into the sourcecode of the Ext.app.Application but I could not find where the loader get initialized.

So guess the best is to modify the Ext.Loader, isnt it Or is the loader capable of loading entire namespacesp

Negative 2936 pHi I need some advice from professionals,p  pI am working on project that basic idea is to create system to display the lists of people. The list would be available through website with some js as well as on mobile device. The data on mySQL. There would be some updates to the website to the specific person. This update would use restful api like twitter pushed by the person through their phone. There would be mobile version of the system where other users would check the peoples update. p  pYou would say its a kind of social network but with limited requirements.p  pSo far I come up with creating a hybrid app for any mobile using phonegap but I am not sure if this is right. Ill start with iOS but may also do Android for better outcome. Still not surre how would I manage the database on mobile. I am also working on the website, but shall I make it suitable for mobile view on serverp  pQuestions How would you improve this idea Did I choose the right toolsp  pThank you for the advice.p
Negative 2936 pI have been searching for a service that could do something like, notify a user specific user that they have a new friend request.

Anyway here is what I am trying to accomplish here. I have a MVC social application that uses RavenDB as the datastore, A user may request friendship with another user, I would like to update that client in realtime that they have a new request something that checks every X seconds. I am either looking for a good SignalR example, or documentation hopefully example that may point me in the  right direction, or a good service other than SignalR that would suit my app better.

Negative 2936 pAt the moment Im achieving a zoom effect in OpenGL by translating the camera position into z direction based on some user input keyboard functions. Now Ive looked at several other examples that use zooming and got a little bit confused whether there are different ways of doing this for example by changing the FOV with glmperspective. Is there a difference between changing The fov and my ztranslation, and if so, which way is better What I also dont really understand is when to use glmscale in the context of zooming, since Im not using this either.p

Negative 2936 pI have a huge performance issue when it comes to an SQLite Query with date ranges.p  pIn my application I have a database with a couple of thousands of records of sites. These sites are visitable but not the whole year. Each of those sites can define up to three ranges in which is is visitable. Therefore I created an SQLite Table with following columns emopen1em, emclose1em, emopen2em, emclose2em, emopen3em and emclose3em amongst othersp  pApplication users can enter a time range in which they want to visit a site, e.g. 2014.01.01  2014.01.07p  pNow when I perform a search without restricting the time it is pretty fast. But when I use the opening time as search criteria, the search takes up to about 7 seconds on a fast emulator. I do not even want to test this on a real device p  pThe entries in the columns emopenem and emcloseem are of type emDATETIMEem and look like em20140101emp  pMy current query is as followsp  precode    SELECT open1,close1,open2,close2,open3,close3 FROM sites WHERE          strftimeYmd, 20140101 BETWEEN open1 AND close1  AND  strftimeYmd, 20140107 BETWEEN open1 AND close1         OR         strftimeYmd, 20140101 BETWEEN open2 AND close2  AND  strftimeYmd, 20140107 BETWEEN open2 AND close2         OR         strftimeYmd, 20140101 BETWEEN open3 AND close3  AND  strftimeYmd, 20140107 BETWEEN open3 AND close3        codepre  pIs there a simple way to improve the performancep  pNotice I tried using utc values in emlongem format for emopenem and emcloseem but this is not really debuggable.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 2936 pLong story short, Im working on an examtaking application as part of my internship. Im currently on the candidate console module, which is responsible for displaying questions per section and collecting responses. Response collection is based on the type of question that is offered. If the question is multiple choice, the candidate console displays it using a groupbox of custom radio buttons. For example p  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comaOVSxCQ.png relnofollowMCQ Responseap  pIf the question is multiple select, the candidate console displays it using a groupbox of custom checkboxes. For example p  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comqfIZx2j.png relnofollowMSQ Responseap  pIve been able to successfully implement MCQ response collection with some help from IRC.

MCQResponse is a Dictionaryltint, ButtonBasegt which stores ltQuestionNumber, CustomRadiogt. if QuesTypes[i].EqualsMCQ           if questionDisplay1.MCQResponse.TryGetValuei, out temp ampamp questionDisplay1.MCQResponse[i].Text.Equalss                          questionDisplay1.AddOptionmcqs, true, i, optionId                    else                questionDisplay1.AddOptionmcqs, false, i, optionId  codepre  pcodeMCQResponsecode and codeMSQResponsecode are of type codeDictionaryltint, ButtonBasegtcode and codeDictionaryltint, ListltButtonBasegtgtcode respectively. They store data according to a QuestionNumberObject mapping, where Object may be codeCustomRadiocode or codeCustomCheckscode.p  pFor MCQs, I use a temporary ButtonBase object, codetempcode, to store the CustomRadio object when it is clicked CheckedChanged event. For the first time the question is marked, the dictionary is checked. If not present, the entry is added. For all other times, the entry is simply edited.p  pNow for MSQs, Im trying to follow a similar logic but am screwing up somewhere. I use a temporary List object, codeMSQscode, to store multiple CustomChecks responses. In the first if case, I clear the List if I am on a different question from the one in which I clicked a checkbox. Next, I check if the checkbox is not already present in the List. If not present, I add it. Lastly, I use a similar logic as in MCQ response collection.p  pThe codeforeachcode loop at the end was added for the sake of displaying the CustomChecks elements properly. I ought to be using MSQResponse for that purpose, but Im not able to figure out how. Here are the main problems Im facing p  ul liMSQ responses are persistently displayed only for one question. If I select checkboxes in another question, the previous ones are not displayed. I have to build code in the main project similar to how Ive done for MCQs, and am not able to figure it out for that purpose.li liThe use of codeMSQResponsecode. Im not using it properly for sure. There has to be a more efficient way to collect MSQ responses using this dictionary.li liThe double foreach loop at the end of the MSQ method is quite expensive. I have heard of Zip operations in .NET 4, but Im using .NET 3.5 on strict instructions by my project incharge. It is only for the purpose of displaying persistently, but it works only for one question. If I could do away with it altogether, Id be glad.li ul  pAny help will be greatly appreciatedp  hr  h2strongEDITstrongh2  pSo, I tried out the approach given by James Holderness. Code is as follows p  precodepublic void AddOptionmsqstring optionText, bool arg, int QNo, int option          CustomChecks cb  new CustomChecks         cb.Text  optionText         cb.Location  new Point3, 40  grbOptions.Controls.Count  30         cb.AutoSize  true         cb.Checked  arg         cb.QuestionNumber  QNo         cb.optionId  option          cb.CheckedChanged  delegateObject sender, System.EventArgs e                      temp  sender as CustomChecks             if ResponseMSQ.ContainsKeyQNo                               First time, add an empty list                 ResponseMSQ.AddQNo, new ListltButtonBasegt                           if ResponseMSQ[QNo].Anyx gt x.Text.EqualsoptionText Check if the checkbox already exists in the List                              ResponseMSQ[QNo].Addtemp                          if CustomCheckstemp.Checked  false Removing the checkbox if deselected                              foreach CustomChecks C in ResponseMSQ[QNo]                     if C.Text.Equalstemp.Text                                              ResponseMSQ[QNo].RemoveC                         break                                                     grbOptions.Controls.Addcb         if ResponseMSQ.ContainsKeyQNo ampamp ResponseMSQ[QNo].Any For persistently displaying the proper checked state.                      foreach CustomChecks C in ResponseMSQ[QNo]                              foreach CustomChecks D in grbOptions.Controls                                      if D.Text.EqualsC.Text                                              D.Checked  C.Checked                                                              codepre  pThis works quite well. I debugged to check whether p  ol liResponses were being stored ResponseMSQ was storing them as was needed.li liCheckboxes were being displayed as required The state of the checkboxes was being displayed properly due to the double codeforeachcode at the end.li ol  pNow the only concern that remains is about the running time of the double codeforeachcode, but this solution works. If anyone knows a better way than iterating through two lists at once, they can post it in comments. Thanks againp

Negative 2936 pIve just updated Twitter Bootstrap on a website Im developing and it broke the layout in a number of places.p  pOne of these places just has me stumped. The page in question can be seen at a hrefhttpsoftcircuits.comclientspacingtest.htm relnofollowhttpsoftcircuits.comclientspacingtest.htma. This is not the original site and will produce some scripting errors, but it shows the layout issue. The original site requires an account.p  pThere is a black 20px bar that runs across the very top of the page, with an image just below that. However, the image is placed about 22px from the top, leaving a 2px margin just below the black bar. After looking at this for a while, I still cannot figure out where this margin is coming from. I would like the image and black areas on the side to be flush up against the black bar.p  pIm testing in Chrome. Would appreciate any tips.p

Negative 2936 pSo Im trying to convert an NSRect to a CGRect. I used codeNSRectToCGRectcode which copies everything over finely, but does not take into account yorigin axis.p  pThe problem A CGRect origin of 0,0 is the top left. NSRect origin 0,0 is bottom left.p  pThus an codeNSRect 0,0,100,100code box is positioned at the bottom left of your screen, while a codeCGRect 0,0,100,100code box is placed at the top left of your screen.p  pI have a hack that fixes the yorigin through basic math p  precodefixedOriginY  screenHeight  NSRect.size.height  NSRect.origin.y codepre  pThus the equivalent of an codeNSRect 0,0,100,100code is actually codeCGRect 0,800,100,100code on my 900px height MBA. However I dont like this, I have a feeling it will breakhave issues with retina or future complications.p  pDoes anyone have a solution or idea on how to correctly convert NSRect to CGRectp
Negative 2936 pI used the a hrefhttpssvn.apache.orgreposasfhadoopcommontrunkhadoopmapreduceprojecthadoopmapreduceexamplessrcmainjavaorgapachehadoopexamplesWordStandardDeviation.java relnofollowcode given herea and modified it to find standard deviation of numbers. The input is a file containing only numbers, separated by codencode. I am generating the input using a C code for random number generator.p  pNow, when I run the program, it runs fine for 100,000 values, gives a correct output, but when I increase it to 100,000 values, the standard deviation is returned as codeNaNcode.p  pI dont understand why it shouldnt be a number, there is no problem in the input file, I have checked already.

Negative 2936 pI have a certsecurity question in relation to WCF, but I lack the understanding of certs so its been tough for me. Im sure someone with more experience can help out  The .net error I get is SecurityNegotiationException strongError Could not establish trust relationship for the SSLTLS secure channelstrong with authority [3rd party web service address]p  pemIf you cant help with exact WCF configuration, then what would be awesome is if you can help me better understand the purposetype of certsPFXs Im using, it will help me out tremendously. Or if you have any troubleshooting ideas  Id gladly be open to trying them out to best figure this out.emp  pHow can I verify that the certs Im attaching are the same as what soapUI had I was going to use Fiddler to compare requests, but running into different issues with that not being captured for soapUI and for .net, it doesnt show me the xml request for some reason.p  h3MORE DETAILED INFOh3  pAnyway, onto the scenario Im dealing with a 3rd party and in order to bring up their webservice in a browser, I needed to have their WS.cert installed in my trusted root of the local computer.p  pTheres a working example that Ive been given in soapUI and it works to the 3rd partys service. For some reason I have 2 pfx files given to me a.pfx and b.pfx  Channel cert and Im not entirely sure of the type or purpose of each, but both were needed for soapUI to work. I have what they told me is a Message signing cert   a.pfx, and I set it up like sop  pAdded it here with name a.pfx soapUI project  properties  WSSecurity Configurations  Keystores  Certificates.p  pAnd under soapUI project  properties  WSSecurity Configurations  Outgoing WSSecurity Configurations, I added a configuration of ws.

If I take the codescaleYcode out of codereverseWaveScaleAnimationcode, and replace it with another attribute lets say codeopacitycode, the two Tweens work correctly the codescaleYcode of codewavescode is changed during codewaveScaleAnimationcode and its opacity is changed during codereverseWaveScaleAnimationcode.

Negative 2936 pEDIT Fixed, unconventially I think, all I did was marginleft auto marginright auto, the nav menu, and gave it a fixed width of my liking 1002px, in my case, and made the positioning relative, and created another div which had a mock background, and made it absolute. Thanks to the guys that offered solutions though, appreciate it.p  pWas wondering if anyone could help me with this problem. Currently designing a website, where the nav menu div doesnt have a fixed width width 100, and inside this nav menu div are the unordered lists Home  About  Services  Gallery  Contact. So the problem is, when I preview my website in a browser, the Home  About etc. floats to the left, and when I scroll out, making the page smaller, it continues floating left. So my question, without having to fix the width of the div, would anyone happen to know how to position these unordered lists, so that it is flush or in line with the rest of my pagecontent.p  pheres the css for the navigation menup  precodecharset utf8 navigation      width 100     margin 0     padding 0     height 40px     backgroundimage url..picturesnavbg.jpg  navigation ul      liststyle none     margin 0     padding 0  navigation li      float left  navigation ul li a      textdecoration none     float left     fontfamily Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif     color 000     textalign center     display block     width 88px     height 30px     backgroundimage url..picturesnavbutton.jpg     paddingtop 10px  navigation ul li ahover      backgroundimageurl..picturesnavbuttonhover.jpg  codepre

Negative 2936 pI have a written a program using gamekitbluetooth to transfer low quality video using compressed jpegs from one iOS device to another.  I do already realize that gamekitbluetooth should not be used for this purpose for small chunks of data but it does indeed work well streaming 15 low quality compressed jpegssecond with little to no latency.p  pThe question I have is once I increase either the quality or frame rate from the iOS device sender to the iOS receiver, a lag or delay will occur and will no longer be real time.  If there is a delay, Id like somehow for the sending iOS device to discard frames so that the receiver can catchup or for the receiver to ignore the backlog queue.p  pIn GameKit I have set the session mode to use GKSendDataUnreliable to see if it could help, but to no avail.p  pIf delays occur, what is the best solution and correct approach to discard the frames jpegs so that the iOS receiver can then catch up back to real time  Would the sender need to stop transmission for a period of time or is there something that receiving client can do to discard the accumulating queue.  p  pIve used NSStream before as well, and while using wifi allows for greater bandwidth, the same problem will still occur in terms of delays if too much data is being transmitted.p  pThank you in advance for your help.p

Negative 2936 pI have a window, and I want to implement the borders as resizing borders, like any other window. Taking in suggestions from comments and answers, I have rewritten my code. For WMGETMINMAXINFO I havep  precodeMINMAXINFO minmax  reinterpretcastltMINMAXINFO gtlparam  minmaxgtptMinTrackSize.x  MINX minmaxgtptMinTrackSize.y  MINY codepre  pMINX and MINY are the minimum size I want the window to be.

This code gives me a border that I can drag to resize the window. It works well when I drag the bottomright, bottom, and right borders. With the other borders, the bottomright corner of the window still seems to move back and forth when I try to drag them. Its similar to what is seen in Google Chrome or Visual Studio 2012 with the same set of borders, but I dont see this in Windows Explorer.p  pIs there a way to make the bottomright corner not wriggle back and forth as Im resizing the top or left borders, like in Windows Explorerp

Negative 2936 pThe company for which Im consulting has a specific business requirement that each instance of certain WPF Windows MUST have their own UI Thread and NOT share the default UI thread created by .NET Framework when the application is first loaded.p  pFrom a coding perspective, this is easy to accomplish and works well, until introducing the Telerik RadDocking control in the xaml. I have copied and pasted the xaml form teleriks RadDocking example directly from the sample code without modifying it. When the app launches, both instances of WindowWithTelerikDockingFromExample [seemingly] load without issue at first, in fact, the second instance of the window titled Window on seperate UI Thread... is operational and works, as does MainWindow. Its not until you activate the second window and then activate the main window, and then switch back to the second window that the following exception is thrownp  pThe calling thread cannot access this object because a different thread owns it.p  pLocating source forp  precodecTB117WPFScrumReleaseWPFSourcesDevelopmentControlsDockingDockingPartsAutoHideArea.cs.

Negative 2936 pI have a webpage that contains a header and a main section.  Both the header and the main section make the same call to one particular Java API running on my server.  The first call should establish a session and set a flag in the session which prevents the second call from proceeding until the first call completes e.g. its blocking.p  pWhat currently happens is the header usually makes the call first, establishes a session and sets the flag.  Then, the main section makes the call however, for some reason, it is establishing an entirely new session so it never sees the flag and both calls run consecutively.  This consecutively running process causes a problem with the underlying database which is a separate issue.p  pSo my question is, why are two separate sessions being established  Why isnt the second call recognizing the first session and using itp

But using the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationjavascriptplaces relnofollowPlaces Librarya with Maps API, it seems that you must always provide a nearby location when searching.

Negative 2936 pI am interested in detecting single object more precisely a fire extinguisher which has no inter class variability all fire extinguisher looks same. However, The application is supposedly realtime i.e a robot is exploring the environment and whenever it sees the object of interest it should be able to detect it and give pixel coordinates of it. p  pMy question is which algorithm will be good choice for this taskbr 1. Is this a classification problem and should we use featuressiftsurf etc  bow svmbr 2. some other solution no idea yet.p  pAny kind of input will be appreciated.

Both the variants across fragments and across genes first calculates statistics for  using first statistics from every applicable replicate1, then every replicate2, then replicate3, i.e. unknown number of values from unknown number of rows and after that do the same statistics using the  values previously calculated i.e. always three values. p  pI have a script that does this, almost, but its very long and I think overly complicated.

Negative 2936 pIm building a website for a Chinese restaurant. I have a drop down navigation menu, and in it I have a link to a menu.html page that has food categories which drop down when a user goes over a menu link with the mouse pointer. Every category is supposed to show a pricelist, and all pricelist data is stored in one XML file. Every category is supposed to show its pricelist on the same page  menu.html page. XML data is being retrieved and shown with a JavaScript function, which is called from an codeltagtcode tag in a dropdown menu using codeonclickcode. This works well when I press a link in the dropdown, but only when I am already on the menu.html page.p  pThe problem is when I want to press a link outside of the menu page e.g. the home page it shows me only the menu page but without XML data pricelist. I assume that a js function cannot be called on codepage1code and executed on codepage2code, especially if it should get elements from codepage2code via codedocument.getElementByIdcode and codeinnerHTMLcode data on them. The whole idea was to have only one menu page that will show chosen pricelists that are stored in one XML file. p  pIs there any simple way to solve this or this was a bad idea in the first place By the way Im a beginner, this is my first website, and this might be simple, but I dont know where to start from, since my knowledge of JavaScript is poor...

Negative 2936 pIn an application Im working on, in some cases the application runs pretty slowly and in these cases Ive discovered that my moving the mouse, timerpaint messages are not being handled. If I move the mouse in a slow circle, I can indefinitely prevent the window being repaintedp  pI found that this is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms64492728vvs.8529.aspxquequedmessages relnofollowexpected behaviourap  blockquote   pWith the exception of the WMPAINT message, the WMTIMER message, and   the WMQUIT message, the system always posts messages at the end of a   message queue. This ensures that a window receives its input messages   in the proper first in, first out FIFO sequence. The WMPAINT   message, the WMTIMER message, and the WMQUIT message, however, are   kept in the queue and are forwarded to the window procedure only when   the queue contains no other messages. In addition, multiple WMPAINT   messages for the same window are combined into a single WMPAINT   message, consolidating all invalid parts of the client area into a   single area. Combining WMPAINT messages reduces the number of times a   window must redraw the contents of its client area.p blockquote  pHowever, what can I do about this Sometimes in direct response to a mousemove, I need to repaint as quickly as possible.p  pI catch messages through a method like this on my CWndderived classp  pcodevirtual LRESULT WindowProcUINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParamcodep

Negative 2936 pI have a very basic question.  I am a student and I want to learn a proper way of creating a database with MySQL, like a DBA, starting from Entity diagram and what is the best tool to use, and then next step after the diagram and what tool is good to create a database.  The front end is using Javascript, backbone, and Jquery mobile. It would be great if someone can show me some direction as where to start and which way to go.  Thanks.p

Negative 2936 pIve been researching and testing various solutions for hours on end, trying to find the right htaccess directive to prompt my server to parse html as php. I have read numerous threads on this forum, such as the ones a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4687208usinghtaccesstomakeallhtmlpagestorunasphpfilesherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6237044parsinghtmlfilesasphpherea, along with many other resources, and I still havent been able to find the right directive.p  pMy hosting provider is XO Communcations, and their support is utterly horrendous they do not even technically offer support for these sorts of questions beyond reviewing the paltry contents of their online knowledge base I plan to switch providers soon, but Im hoping to find a workable solution in the meantime.

Negative 2936 pI am getting a Django 1.6 set up started on a Linux Debian Whiskey server on Google Compute Engine. Ive got Celery 3.1 running in the background to help with some processes.

Negative 2936 pI have a program which allows Android tablets Nexus 7 2012 and Samsung Galaxy 10.1  to interact with a Forth system on PIC.  Communication between the two is via Bluetooth using a variant of the Bluetooth Service sample app. The basic arrangement is working, but I have extended it to access commands saved on the tablet as text files.  Files may contain multiple lines of code.  The application structure is a main activity which simply provides access to various Fragments  in particular TerminalFragment for the entry of command strings using a soft keyboard with a TextView to display commands and replies.  Bluetooth comms are via a separate class BtService in its own file, with file handling through a separate FileListActivity.p  pEach command line entered from the tablet should return an acknowledgement either result   ok  if good, or an error message if not. There are no problems if a single line is entered from the keyboard, or if a singleline file is used.  If I use a multiline file, each line is sent separately and I expect to see the response to that line displayed on the terminal immediately after the command line  so that any errors etc are associated with the relevant command.p  pFor example,p  precode1 2  U.     command 3            result  ok         acknowledgement  codepre  pHowever, the display shows all commands in a file as a block followed by the responses, also as a block p  precode1 2  U. 3 4  U. 5 6  U. 3  ok 7  ok B  ok codepre  pLogcat shows that the response to each command line is received immediately it has been sent, and prior to the next command line being transmitted. The replies are forwarded to the main activity through a message handler. However, the main activity does not handle these messages immediately but only after all the lines in the file have been sent and acknowledged.p  pAs I dont know a lot about the details of the interactions between the message service and target activities, can anyone explain what is going on and if there is a simple fix that would allow me to do what I want I have tried using a flag to hold off sending a line command until the acknowledgement to the last has been received, but this could potentially cause a lockup if the target device doesnt react  which is likely in the final applications.p

Negative 2936 pMy Windows 7 computer seems to not want to allow me to change my LAN settings to add a proxy .pac and save my changes.  I can deselect checkboxes and enter proxy addresses, but after I click ok, and open the settings again, they revert back to what they were. I was able to find out how to force the option I prefer through the registry keys  though I would rather it just allow me to change my selection through IE tools  Internet Options.  I had found a work around by changing my group policy settings.  The strange thing here is that it changed my IE settings and my Control Panel  Internet Options, but when I go to Google Chrome and check the proxy settings, it seems to be going to a different area because the settings arent the same. these settings have the title Internet Properties vs IE settings of Internet Options  I know Chrome is supposed to be using IEs settings, but on my computer they seem to be different.  I was able to force change the Chrome settings to the selection I want, but I cant seem to find where to set the Use Automatic Configuration Script url in the registry.  I tried changing the AutoConfigURL in my HKCU registry for Internet Settings in Windows and added one to HKLM with no affect.p  pI believe a virus caused these problems.  My antivirus software found it, but it seems not until after it affected my computer.p  pCan anyone help me to either A force Chrome to keep a .pac file that I set or B free the options so I can change them at will without immediately reverting back.p

Negative 2936 pI started working on a EF Code First approach and autogenerated the database. Now I want to add another entity that maps to a SQL view and not a table. Im using a view because the data employee info is in a separate database. I add the view and created an entity but I keep getting the error that the context has changed and I need to manuall deleteupdate the database or call the SetInitializer method. I think the problem is with my model definition or in my assumption on the DB changes.p  pThe basic entities are AppUser application specific user and vEmp view to employee data. Not much to the AppUser entityp  precodepublic class AppUser      public AppUser                [Key]     public int AppUserId  get set      [MaxLength75]     public string ntUserDomainId  get set      public bool isActive  get set       public virtual vEmp vEmp  get set   this was commented out at first to generate tables   codepre  pThe vEmp entity is defined as thisp  precodepublic class vEmp      [Key, ForeignKeyAppUser]     public int AppUserId  get set      public string empName  get set      public string empStatus  get set      public string orgid  get set      public string email  get set      public string ntUserDomainId  get set       public virtual AppUser AppUser  get set    codepre  pTo make this work I commented out the navigation property in AppUser so EF would generate the tables. Then I uncommented out the navigation property and ran into the error. If I try to keep the navigation property in then EF assumes a table and creates vEmp as a table. The view actually matches on the user NT ID to form the query results  we use Windows Authentication so every user has their NT ID inside the AppUser table. p  pFrom what I can tell the [Key, ForeignKeyAppUser] line should tell EF how to manage the relationship. My only guess is that EF wants a cross reference table created to map between the two. p  pI am also wondering if perhaps the easier approach is to go DB first and use EF to generate a model from the DB. I did one test project with a similar vEmp entitye and an AppUser entity using the autogenerated EDMX and that seemed to work after I manually made the association. We have lots of shared databases so using views is going to be common and I wonder if code first is too difficult to work with in such situations. p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI think I have proof that EF wants to create a table.

Does this mean that code first doesnt work with SQL views p  pstrongUpdate 2strong After many failed attempts to get the code first syntax working I created an edmx model from the database as it existed to test the DB first process. I added all the tables created with my code first logic and the SQL view that I added. Then I just created an association with the modeling tool from the table AppUser to the view vEmp.

Negative 2936 pI am creating a form that has multiple subforms inside it. Let me elaborate I am creating a form for a class in the university. That class has multiple stuff in its model like name,size, etc.. However, I need to attach students to that class. Students have only two fields in their model name and typep  pI need to be able to control all of this from a single form. So normally in PHP the names of the fields would be something like p  precodename size student[name][] student[type][] student[name][] student[type][] codepre  pWhich would collect all of the students information in arrays, which can later be accessed. In that form I will also need to dynamically add the number of student fields, but I guess that can be done with javascript.p  pstrongMy questions arestrong How do I control such a behaviour in Phalcon Can I use the builder to create fields like that and can I instruct it that those fields are endless, i.e. no specific amount of students Will I be able to validate all of the students names using the validatorp
Negative 2936 pI have a problem with data binding using WPF and vb.net. Actually, I tried it using WPFxaml and C and it worked very well.

Negative 2936 pIn C 11, The new universal initialization syntax can also be used to call a normal constructor that doesnt take a initializerlist parameter. While by looking it is not bad, I think that could cause a problem in real world usage.p  pSo suppose in my project I use a library that comes with the following classp  precodeclass Foo  public     Fooint size, int value  create size number of elements     Fooinitializerlistltintgt list   create elements as in list  codepre  pIn the project it is used in this wayp  precodeFoo foo10, 2   initialize foo with 2 elements 10 and 2 codepre  pNow the library got a new release and in the new release the author has removed the 2nd constructor that takes a initializerlist either by purpose or by mistake. I didnt notice the change and my project builds happily as before, only with an unexpected foo being initialized now its 10 elements instead of 2.p  pA different version of this problem is that Foo had only the 1st constructor and you use the universal initialization syntax to init foo, and now the author has decided to add the 2nd constructor and that equally causes foo to be initialized with different elements without being noticed.p  pJust wanted to know other peoples opinion about this. Is it a real problem or am I worrying too much Is there any solution to prevent this from happening Thanks. p

Im no git expert, so even if I could live with the source on the dev branch, Ive never successfully managed to build it.p  pEDIT  I did manage to get Qt 5.4.0 via git and successfully run codeperl initrepositorycode.  However, when I copy that source to Windows and try to run codeconfigurecode, it complains about missing qtbaseconfigure.exe.  If I copy configure.exe from the .zip version of Qt 5.4.0, codeconfigurecode fails with codeCqtqt5gitqtbasesrccorelibglobalqglobal.h68  fatal error C1083 Cannot open include file QtCoreqsystemdetection.h No such file or directorycode.  Of course, the qsystemdetection.h does exist in the same folder as qglobal.h.p  pIf I use git to get Qt 5.4.0 on Windows and run codeperl initrepositorycode, that works fine on Windows.  But copying to OS X yields the same problem as using the .zip file, described above.p  pThere must be some way to do this  When Qts whole reason for existence is for  crossplatform development, its just too ironic that Qt5 requires me to maintain 2 separate code bases one for Windows, one for OS X just to be able to build it.p  pSo what am I missing  How do I get a copy of Qt 5.4.0 that I can modify slightly, then build on both Windows and OS Xp
Negative 2936 pI am trying to write a GDB frontend. I use GDB for debugging embedded targets, especially with ARM processors. I have used Eclipse before, but I didnt like it very much. At work, we use Lauterbach Trace32, which is one of the most comfortable debuggers I have ever used. Thats why I started a project where I try to implement a very similar application as a GDB frontend, which is specialised to embedded debugging.p  pHowever, I already have implemented some very basic commands, like viewing the source code, viewing registers of the target etc., which works well. Currently, I am implementing breakpoints. But for this I need some help.p  pI use Qt with Qtcreator on Linux for my project, so I have set up a QProcess for the gdb running in the background. I use the GDB Mi2 interface to communicate with gdb. Then, using write I can send commands and with a SIGNAL, I can receive the responses from GDB. This works well, but the answers from GDB in this MI format are very ugly to parse. Could anyone give me a hint how this can be done in a elegant way I tried BOOST to build a parser, which worked, but this is a much too complicated way in my opinion. Is there some better way to parse the GDB responsesp

Negative 2936 ptldr inconsistent Drupal page execution times after user performs certain actions possibly to do with DB write.p  pWe have a complex Drupal site running on a fairlystandard LAMP VPS setup. Among other things, we are using Rules to provide a great deal of custom functionality, as well as User Relationships, Organic Groups and custom modules. PHP is running under Apache modphp and MemCache and APC are enabled though APC was not enabled when this issue was first noticed.p  pHeres the problem having experienced inconsistent page load times sometimes good  200ms, sometimes only barely acceptable  4,000ms, sometimes abominably unacceptable  20,000ms we coded a timer to display custom PHP execution times onpage. The times we saw were uniformly acceptable both on very simple pages and also on ones where a great deal of backend processing had occurred due to the users actions on the previous page. However, the intermittent page load problem persisted  the system was sometimes taking fifteen seconds to serve the page timetofirstbyte even though the processing had been demonstrably performed in a tiny fraction of that time. p  pIn fact, we were able to see that Drupal was processing code rapidly in other ways for instance, an email triggered by Rules would arrive in an inbox ten seconds or more before the user who triggered the rule got to see the confirmation page Similarly, when a Rules action or User Relationships caused a change in a user objects custom field, that change would be visible to an administrator while the users browser was still waiting for data.p  pWe were able to consistently predict when these long page load times would occurp  ul lipOnly after a user performed a individuallyspecific action, such as confirming a new friend via User Relationships, performing an action only available to a member of a group via Rules  Organic Groups or something causing one of our custom modules to perform actions on the user object. General site navigation appears normally OK.pli lipRegardless of the number or combination of modules involved Rules andor OG andor UR andor custom modulespli lipRegardless of the page to be loaded  the page experiencing a long load time could be a very simple static page you have successfully done X or a complex construction such as a list of all a users friends and their details.pli ul  pWe can tentatively draw the following conclusionsp  ul lipPHPDrupal processing speed is not at fault we know all processing is being taken care of quickly.pli lipGeneral server tuning is not at fault otherwise all page loads would likely be sluggish.pli lipPage complexity is not a significant factor.pli lipInternet connection speed is not a significant factor.pli lipNo specific single or apparent combination of modules is at fault.pli lipThere is some factor that were not considering, or dont know enough about to pin down the precise cause.pli ul  pWe think this may be a caching issue, but note that this happens only where a users actions cause a database write... Does this scenario sound familiarexplicable to anyonep

Negative 2936 pI created my first Cocoa App for OS X and was happy to finally submit it to iTunes connect. Just to get not approved because the application is crashing. I had a hard time to figure out all things until here and now Im finally stuck and dont know how to solve the following issuep  pFirst of all, the application works perfectly fine when simply built and run. The mysterious crash will only happen when the app is archived. Thats why I did not notice the cash before and submitted the not working app to iTunes Connect.p  pI symolicated the crash log and the app crashes at a point where it just doesnt make any sense for me.

Even this would crash codeNSLog[TEST] , countryListcode, even though it should be the exact same from my understanding. And again, this only happens when the application is archived in preparation for sending it to iTunes connect. Zero issues when simply built and run.p  pI am tempted to simply leave the codeNSLogcode in there and ship it that way, but I would like to understand what is going on an how to solve it appropriate.p  pEdit Just installed the update Xcode 6.2 and have the same problem as with 6.1.1.p

Negative 2936 pIm working with several fellow classmates on a simple mobile app in Titanium. Im running into a problem though, as when I pull the files from github as a new project it isnt classified as a mobile project, just as a blank project. Basically, this keeps me from being able to run the project for any reason, the option to do so is just grayed out. The code works in a new project I create as a mobile app, but for some reason Titanium doesnt recognize the pulled project as something that can be run. Ive confirmed that the deployment targets in the pulled project are checked for Android and Mobile Web, is there something else I should be looking for, or a command I need to enterp

Negative 2936 pIn my MFC app, the user can minimize a window that has a CListCtrl inside. I need to know how many visible items the list control will be showing once the user restores the window. p  pThe first implementation used codeGetCountPerPagecode. This was working great until we noticed the minimized window case and found it was returning zero.p  pIve also tried codeGetClientRectcode, codeGetWindowRectcode and codeGetWindowPlacementcode using codercNormalPositioncode to attempt to figure out the size of the CListCtrl so I can compute the page count manually. All these APIs return empty rectangles positioned at various offscreen locations. p  pWhats the best way to figure out what the CListCtrls height will be once I restore the window Surely the real window rectangle is available somehow.p

Now I manage to move keypoints orange data points but the path stays out of sync with the movement of the points.This is my approachp  precode     var sampledata  [       id 0,       x 2001,       y 10     ,        id 1,       x 2002,       y 12     ,        id 2,       x 2003,       y 9     ,        id 3,       x 2004,       y 10     ,        id 4,       x 2005,       y 11     ,        id 5,       x 2006,       y 8     ,       id 6,       x 2007,       y 10     ,       id 7,       x 2008,       y 11     ,       id 8,       x 2009,       y 9     ,       id 9,       x 2010,       y 10        ]  var indices  d3.range0, samplepodaci.length console.logindices  Main dragging function  possibly this is the problematic one...  function dragmoved      var y  d3.event.y     var notac  d3.selectthis.attrtaid     var krivapath  d3.selectpathserija     d3.selectthis.attrtransform, translate  0  ,  y       samplepodaci[notac].y  d3.event.y     krivapath.attrd, lineFuncsamplepodaci        function dragcolstartd      d3.selectthis.attrfill, b91d47       function dragcolendd      d3.selectthis.attrfill, e3a21a        var dragfunction  d3.behavior.drag function for dragging behaviour   .originfunction       var t  d3.selectthis      return x t.attrx  d3.transformt.attrtransform.translate[0],              y t.attry  d3.transformt.attrtransform.translate[1]                   .ondragstart, dragcolstart     .ondrag, dragmove     .ondragend, dragcolend    var vis  d3.selectd3primer,     WIDTH  900,     HEIGHT  450,     MARGINS  margin,     xRange  d3.scale.linear.range[MARGINS.left, WIDTH  MARGINS.right].domain[d3.minsampledata, function d          return d.x       ,       d3.maxsampledata, function d          return d.x            ],      yRange  d3.scale.linear.range[HEIGHT  MARGINS.top, MARGINS.bottom].domain[d3.minsampledata, function d          return d.y5       ,       d3.maxsampledata, function d          return d.y5            ],      xAxis  d3.svg.axis       .scalexRange       .tickSize5       .tickSubdividetrue       .tickFormatd3.formatd,      yAxis  d3.svg.axis       .scaleyRange       .tickSize5       .orientleft       .tickSubdividetrue  Drawing of the svg path    vis.appendsvgg     .attrclass, x axis     .attrtransform, translate0,  HEIGHT  MARGINS.bottom       .callxAxis    vis.appendsvgg     .attrclass, y axis     .attrtransform, translate  MARGINS.left  ,0     .callyAxis    var lineFunc  d3.svg.line   .xfunction d      return xRanged.x      .yfunction d      return yRanged.y      .interpolatemonotone     vis.appendsvgpath Dodavanje grafika na plot     .attrd, lineFuncsamplepodaci     .attrid, serija     .attrstroke, 00aedb     .attrstrokewidth, 3     .attrfill, none  Drawing of the keypoints data points    vis.selectAllline.circle     .datasamplepodaci     .enter     .appendcircle     .attr            class circle,       cx  functiond  return xRanged.x ,       cy  functiond  return yRanged.y ,       r  5,       taid  functiond  return d.id ,       fill  e3a21a          .calldragfunction codepre  pNow in function emdragmoveem I manage to translate the coordinates of points so they move along the y axis but it is only visually so since their cx and cy are not in the scale of the y axis at all.

The thing was that emd3.event.yem values are in mouse coordinates and my data is, well in data coordinate system, so there had to be a onetoone copy function. Surprisingly d3 has em.ivertem method which allows for switching between coordinate systems. So I had only to change my emdragmoveem method like thisp  precodefunction dragmoved      var dragPoint  d3.selectthis     dragPoint      .attrcy, d3.event.dy  parseIntdragPoint.attrcy     var datay  yRangeparseIntdragPoint.attrcy     var notac  d3.selectthis.attrtaid     sampledata[notac].y  yRange.invertyRange.invertdatay     var krivapath  d3.selectpathserija     krivapath.attrd, lineFuncsamplepodaci  P     codepre

Cheap cars do not have turbo and expensive cars are not sold in second hand.p  pThe issue I face here is the coupling of classes that contains inherited classes as well. Therefore, if codeExpensiveCarRetailercode inherits from codeCarRetailercode, it will need to implement  codevirtual stdvectorltCargt getcars code that is actually returning a vector of codeCarcode, however, internally codeExpensiveCarRetailercode only created objects of codeExpensiveCarcode. Furthermore, the codegetcarsforexhibitionscode is not included in the public interface codeCarRetailercodetherefore, it can return a codestdvectorltExpensiveCargtcode instead.p  pThe mixture in the API  returning vector of codeCarcode and codeExpensiveCarcode  is very ugly, and so is the code that the user needs to write to use the codeapplyturbo code function of the list of cars from a specific codeExpesiveCarsRetailercode.p  precodeExpensiveCarsRetailer ferrari  stdvectorltCargt car  ferrari.getcars ExpensiveCar expensivecar for int i  0 i lt car.size  i  expensivecar  dynamiccastltExpensiveCargtcar[i] expensivecargtapplyturbo  codepre  pI am sure I am missing some design pattern that helps in this situation, where to trees of class inheritances are coupled in a way that the abstract class of one of the inheritance tress need to return a vector or set, list, etc  of classes on the other inheritance tree.

Negative 2936 pAfter a lot of hours searching both StackOverflow and Google, I have not found my answer yet. Hopefully you can point me in the right direction.p  pA while ago I have updated a web application to meet some new requirements. The application is old and not always built in the cleanest of ways. However, I do not have the time to rebuild it, so I have to deal with it.br In a quite messy jsp a hcommandbutton is used, which calls for an action in a backing bean. This function has worked previously just fine. However a week or so ago I have received a message that the button stopped working. Today I watched them using it and I noticed that the page refreshed, but the action is not performed, which causes several other problems.br The difficulty is, I cant seem to reproduce the problem. In my own local version and the test version which is the same they are using in the same browser they are using, the button works just fine. Something else must have changed recently and be slightly different between their environment and mine, for it not to work. It makes it very difficult for me to solve the problem.br Problems occur in Internet Explorer, and occasionally as I understood it in FireFox.p  pVersion of JSP is 2.0, IEs version is 9.p  pDoes anyone have an ideabr The standard hcommandbutton does not perform actiontopics do not help me, as the button works for me and has worked previously for them. Im thinking of some javascript problem, security settings or something like that.br If more information is needed, please let me know.p

Negative 2936 pIm having some trouble getting a bulk insert to work properly. Currently I have 19 text files that are inserted into a table respective to the file name. Im attempting to add one more. So, the text file is called codetest1.txtcode. p  pHere is the command Im usingp  precodeUSE dbname  TRUNCATE TABLE dbo.test1  DECLARE cmd varchar1000 SET cmd  BULK INSERT dbname.dbo.test1 FROM Ftesttest1.txt WITH       FIELDTERMINATOR  ,             FIRSTROW 2,             ROWTERMINATOR  CHAR10 EXECcmd codepre  pSo, the table is truncated leaving the headers and the field values are then added back with the new data. This works for all the other text files. Here is the catch. The data coming over has a Year and Month column. Im using a data loading tool as part of my ETL process that requires an actual yyyymmdd. So I use the following sql to take the Year and Month Im given for any record, and force it to be the last day of that particular month last day because that is when our aging transactions are recorded. Here is the sql that does thisp  precode    SELECT  DATEADDMM, DATEDIFFMM, 1,         CAST          CAST[ YEAR ] AS VARCHAR4             RIGHT0  CAST[ MONTH ] AS VARCHAR2, 2               RIGHT0  CAST1 AS VARCHAR2, 2          AS DATE, 0 1 as TransDate codepre  pThis works for my purpose. So if I get the following data 2015  08, it will turn that into 20150831. Now here is the kicker. When I run the sql server importexport wizard and insert the test1.txt into a table, and then run that select statement, it works just fine. But using the above bulk insert will cause that select statement to return the following error after its finished  insertingp  blockquote   pConversion failed when converting date andor time from character string.p blockquote  pI realize this may be confusing, but there are a lot of steps in the process I work with. If you have any questions or need clarification please let me know. Any idea whats going on here p  pThanks. p

Negative 2936 pIm new to Access and this is the problem Im suffering I have four tables  Task, Person, Role, and TaskPerson mapping table.  I have a form that at the top has a unbound combo box displaying a list of people from Person.  In the body of the form I have a query pulling from the Task and TaskPerson tables that is embedded as a datasheet.

I am looking to pick a name from the combo box with the datasheet updating to only show the tasks associated with that person i.e. matching the name from the combo box to the name in the person field which is a lookup on the form and only showing those tasks.p  pI have tried adjusting the Record Source for the query so the person field criteria would pull from the combo box usingp  precodeForms[Task Form][Combo11] codepre  pbut that hasnt worked.

Negative 2936 pWe solve boundary integral equations. The matrix is complex symmetric and dense. We use fast algorithm such that the matrix vector product MVP is ONlogN. We use GMRESm as our iterative solver.p  pAnd with the help of TBB and multicore processor, we realized the dot product count for 50 of our solve time. We use tbbparallelreduce and the best we can get for dot product is 2.5x faster, even on a 16 core CPU. p  pI noticed there are some papers talked about this problem, but none seems prevail, I mean being massive adopted.  The one that I have my eyes on are the NewtonArnoldi method by JOCELYNE ERHEL A PARALLEL GMRES VERSION FOR GENERAL SPARSE MATRICES, pipelined version by P. GHYSELS, T.J. ASHBY, K. MEERBERGEN , AND W. VANROOSE HIDING GLOBAL COMMUNICATION LATENCY IN THE GMRES ALGORITHM ON MASSIVELY PARALLEL MACHINES The one that I want to try first is the ICGS GMRES by Luc Giraud, Julien Langou On the loss of orthogonality in the GramSchmidt orthogonalization process. It looks quite straightforward and it is pipelined. However, for the ICGS, it has two vectors equation 2.2 and I do not know which one should feed to the Hessenberg matrix H my GMRES code is similar to the one here a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.commatlabcentralfileexchange2158templatesforthesolutionoflinearsystemscontenttemplatesgmres.m relnofollowhttpwww.mathworks.commatlabcentralfileexchange2158templatesforthesolutionoflinearsystemscontenttemplatesgmres.map  pI guess with the massive parallelization of GPUs and clusters, the poorly scaled dot product will be a bottleneck for lots of GMRES users, especially those finite element experts, who deal with sparse matrix. I definitely should not be alone. I am wondering if you have tried different type of pipelined GMRES alternatives, what is your experiencep  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 2936 pOn a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docstechnotesguidesrmifaq.htmldomain relnofollowOracles FAQ pagea about Java RMI, it saysp  blockquote   pWhile the Java Remote Method Invocation Java RMI server can   theoretically be on any host, it is usually the same host as that on   which the registry is running, and on a different port. Even if the   server is mistaken about its hostname or IP address or has a hostname   that simply isnt resolvable by clients, it will still export all of   its objects using that mistaken hostname, but you will see an   exception every time you try to receive one of those objects.p blockquote  pI dont understand the difference between the RMI Server and the RMI Registry. I thought they were the same thing. How can the RMI Registry work if it wasnt a server of some sortsp
