Positive 119 pI was just wondering if anyone could clear up some confusion I have about using GIT Large File Storage.p  pWhen creating your new repository, I know how to track certain files with Git Lfs track, but how do you specify where those files will be storedp  pFor example, in the project I am working on there are a number of png and wav files.  These are being tracked using Git Lfs track.  The Git Lfs website says that they are stored on a remote server, but I cannot find out where that information is in our repository.  p  pIn addition, when a second user clones the repo, the project contains only pointers to the LFS objects. How can they finduse the url for the remote where the actual files are storedp  pWe are using Bitbucket and a local system git for our repo.p

Positive 119 pSay I am maintaining a legacy application. Adding a feature requires addition of boilerplate code, and currently the fastest way to do this is to use the codegit diffcode of a merge of a similar feature, which contains only changes to apply that feature, and copy and paste them to wear its relevant. Copy and pasting however wastes time so Im looking to speed this process up.p  pSay for example, adding an extra control on a form in a legacy webapp. I would add a getter and setter, and an instance variable in the class, the html for the control, getting the value from post in a controller, and redundant boilerplate code, that I would have to duplicate the next time I want to update that form.p  pSince this kind of change doesnt require any removals, I would like to take the codediffcode and simply apply it again, so it appears at the lines where the changes took place, or any other suggestion that would make this process less laborious, the solution feels like it lies here.p

Positive 119 pWe use git for source control. Each time there is a commit from developers, a script would modify a build file and checks in the file. The script commits the build file with a message that follows a pattern. So the commit history is like the followingp  ul liscript checkin build file 003li lifix this bugli liscript checkin build file 002li liresolve that storyli ul  pWhat I want to do is to remove all commits by the script. Now, obviously, this is very different from removing a particular commit.p  pI have the freedom to start a brand new repository by copying from existing repository, but I still want to preserve the developers commit history as much as possible, while getting rid of the scripts commit history.p  pIs that possiblep  pNote  the scripts commits only changed this single file that is, the build file, and did not change any other file. And, no developers commit ever changed this particular file.p  pSo far what I have been doing is to run bfg tool to delete that particular build file from the git repo. Only the commits from the script ever changed the build file, so I am hoping by removing the build file, the associated commits would be squashed away by git.p  pBut, what I found is the build file is gone, yet all commits are preserved, and those commits, curiously, having 0 changes.p  pSo my next question is is it possible to ask git to remove commits with 0 changesp

How do I resolve this where files exist it both location and can push changes from one location to another all on a windows networkp

The code is old, dating back to Java 1.3 at least, and at some places, it shows... Thats a large code base, some 2 millions of lines, so we cant refactor it all at once.br  Recently, we switched the latest versions from Java 1.4 syntax and JVM to Java 1.6, making conservative use of some new features like codeassertcode we used to use a DEBUG.ASSERT macro  I know codeassertcode has been introduced in 1.4 but we didnt used it before, generics only typed collections, foreach loop, enums, etc.p  pI am still a bit green about the use of assert, although I have read a couple of articles on the topic. Yet, some usages I see leave me perplex, hurting my common sense...  So I thought I should ask some questions, to see if I am right to want to correct stuff, or if it goes against common practices. I am wordy, so I strongboldedstrong the questions, for those liking to skim stuff.p  pFor reference, I have searched emassert javaem in SO and found some interesting threads, but apparently no exact duplicate.p  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions271526howtoavoidnullstatementsinjava relnofollow title How to avoid  null statements in java  How to avoid  null statements in java a and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions302736howmuchnullcheckingisenough relnofollow titleHow much null checking is enoughHow much null checking is enougha are quite relevant, because lot of asserts we have just check if variable is null. At some places in our code, there are usages of the null object eg. returning codenew String[0]code but not always. We have to live with that, at least for maintenance of legacy code.li liSome good answers also in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions298909javaassertionsunderused relnofollow titleJava assertions underusedJava assertions underuseda.li liOh, and SO indicates with reason that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions129120whenshouldiusedebugassert relnofollow titleWhen should I use Debug.AssertWhen should I use Debug.Asserta question is related too nice feature to reduce duplicates.li ul  pFirst, main issue, which triggered my question todayp  precodeSubDocument aSubDoc  documents.GetAt i  assert aSubDoc  null  if  aSubDoc.GetType  GISDOC      continue  assert aSubDoc.GetDoc  null  ContentsInfo ci  ContentsInfo aSubDoc.GetDoc codepre  pemYes, we use MS CC stylecode conventions. And I even like it coming from same background So sue us.embr  First, the codeassertcode form comes from conversion of codeDEBUG.ASSERTcode calls. I dislike the extra parentheses, since assert is a language construct, not no longer, here a function call. I dislike also codereturn foocode br  Next, the asserts dont test here for invariants, they are rather used as guards against bad values. But as I understand it, they are useless here the assert will throw an exception, not even documented with a companion string, and only if assertions are enabled. So if we have codeeacode option, we just have an assertion thrown instead of the regular NullPointerException one. That doesnt look like a paramount advantage, since we catch unchecked exceptions at highest level anyway.br  strongAm I right supposing we can get rid of them and live with that ie. let Java raise such unckecked exceptionstrong or, of course, test against null value if likely, which is done in other places.p  pSide note should I have to assert in the above snippet, I would do that against ci value, not against the getter even if most getters are optimizedinlined, we cannot be sure, so we should avoid calling it twice.p  pSomebody told, in the last referenced thread, that public methods should use tests against values of parameters usage of the public API and private methods should rely on asserts instead. Good advice.br  Now, both kinds of methods must check another source of data external input. Ie. data coming from user, from a database, from some file or from the network, for example.br  In our code, I see asserts against these values. I always change these to real test, so they act even with assertions disabled these are not invariants and must be properly handled.br  I see only one possible exception, where input is supposed constant, for example a database table filled with constants used in relations program would break if this table is changed but corresponding code wasnt updated.br  strongDo you see other exceptionsstrongp  pAnother relatively frequent use I see, which seems OK in the default of a switch, or at the end of a series of  codeelse ifcode testing all possible values these cases date back before our use of enums, there is often an codeassert false  Unexpected value for stuff   stuffcodebr  strongLooks legitimate for me these cases shouldnt happen in production, what do you thinkstrong beyond the no switch, use OO advices which are irrelevant here.p  pAnd finally, strongare there any other useful use cases or annoying gotchasstrong I missed here probablyp

Negative 119 pIm looking for guidance on good practices when it comes to return errors from a REST API. Im working on a new API so I can take it any direction right now. My content type is XML at the moment, but I plan to support JSON in future.p  pI am now adding some error cases, like for instance a client attempts to add a new resource but has exceeded his storage quota. I am already handling certain error cases with HTTP status codes 401 for authentication, 403 for authorization and 404 for plain bad request URIs. I looked over the blessed HTTP error codes but none of the 400417 range seems right to report application specific errors. So at first I was tempted to return my application error with 200 OK and a specific XML payload ie. Pay us more and youll get the storage you need but I stopped to think about it and it seems to soapy shrug in horror. Besides it feels like Im splitting the error responses into distinct cases, as some are http status code driven and other are content driven.p  pSo what is the SO crowd recommendation Good practices please explain why and also, from a client pov, what kind of error handling in the REST API makes life easier for the client codep

Negative 119 pDoes anyone have any good suggestions for working on teams where some members do not use Visual Studio What are other people doingp  pThis is a general questions, but my specific situation is developing ASP.NET MVC applications using Visual Studio 2008 and SVN for source control.p  pIn our office we have small teams. Usually we have one or more developers using Visual Studio and one graphichtmlcss designer using a Mac with no Visual Studio.p  pThis has a couple of problems.p  pFirst, without visual studio the desinger cant see his changes easily. The designers got us to use a technique that they were using on the PHP side of our office. We use a build server so the designers check in their changes and then view them in a web browser pointed at our build server. Not quite what they want They make a tweak and check it in again.p  pSecond, whenever I deploy a project to production I always either do a Publish or use a Web Deployment Project. The problem with this is that if a designer adds a file to the project file structure it isnt automaticly added to the Visual Studio Project file. So someone has to go through all the folders and look for files that arent in the project to make sure everything gets included. Once the file is added, the designer can change the file no problem, unless the delete it which causes heartburn for Visual Studio.p  pOther people must have these same issues. How do they handle themp  pWe can get our designers to use Visual Studio but it really doesnt mesh well for their workflow.p  pIm mostly concerned with the 2nd issue. I dont like issue 1 but our current solution works, however I would really like to know if people have good suggestions.p
Negative 119 pIm having an out of memory error. I have a large range of inputs 240, that is too large to hold at once.

Negative 119 pI have to create a large list of n elements could be up to 100,000. each element in the list is an integer equivalent to the index of the list. After this I have to call Collections.shuffle on this list. My question is, which list implementation either java collections or apache collections should be used. My gut feeling is ArrayList can well be used here.  All thoughts are appreciated. Thanksp  pThanks for the inputs. I think I am sticking to the ArrayList. I am currently using the ArrayList constructor with the initialCapacity param and I pass the size of the list. So if the original list is 100000, I create this new list with new ArrayList100000 Hence I think I dont have the create an array and do an asList since there wont be any resizing. Also, most of the apache collections Lists like GrowthList amp LazyList do not implement RandomAccess. This for sure would slow down the shuffle as per javadocs. FastArrayList does implement RandomAccess but apache has a note for this class saying This class is not crossplatform. Using it may cause unexpected failures on some architectures.p

Negative 119 pI am working with an electronics appliance manufacturer to embed LAN based control systems into the products. The idea is to serve up a system configurationcontrol interface through a web browser so clients never need to install software. We can communicate with the appliance by sending and receiving serial data through the embedded module. Since the appliance can also be controlled from a front panel UI, it creates a challenge to keep a remote web interface in sync with very low latency. It seems like websockets or some sort of Push is what we need for handling real time events from the server to clients.p  pI am using a Lantronix Mathport AR embedded device server. Out of the box the unit will serve up any custom HTML and java servletsapplets. We have the option to install a lightweight Linux distro if we need more flexibility. I am not sure how to implement any server side apps since the device is not running standard Apache. I believe it is using Boa.p  pCan anyone guide me in the right direction of how to do this p

Negative 119 pI am currently learning about Big O Notation running times and amortized times.

Negative 119 pWe have a function that pulls the date from the first 8 characters of a string.

Negative 119 pI wanted to have a GUI frontend for a script that accepts numerous commandline options, most of them are UNIX paths. So I thought rather than typing them in even with autocompletion every time, Id create a GUI front end which contains text boxes with buttons beside them, which when clicked will invoke the file browser dialogue. Later, I thought Id extend this to other scripts which would sure require a different set of GUI elements. This made me think if theres any existing app that would let me create a GUI dialog, after parsing some kind of description of the items that I want that window should contain.p  pI know of programs like Zenity, but I think its doesnt give me what I want. For example, if I were to use it for the first script, itll end up flashing sequence of windows in succession rather than getting everything done from a single window.p  pSo, basically Im looking at some corssplatform program that lets me create a window from a text description, probably XML or the like. Please suggest.p  pThanks Jeenup

Negative 119 pSo Ive recently been playing around with CSS compilers, but I have no idea how or if its possible to dynamically generate pieces of a selector.p  pFor instance, lets say I wanted to make mixins to getp  precodedisplay inlineblock  codepre  pto work cross browser. I would have to do the styles, yeah, but I would have to do the IE67 selector hacks to get them to work in those browsers too.

Negative 119 pThis question is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4306144databasesupertablevsmoretablesvsgenerictableanother question I asked.a In my other question I ask peoples opinions about 3 different ways I could construct a database.  The cleanest way I can think of doing it without practically repeating tables and strange notions such as super tables is option 2p  precodeLocation [Table]  Id  Name  HasLogger  LoggerRFID  LoggerUpperLimit  LoggerLowerLimit  Sensor [Table]  Id [PK]  LocationId [FK]  UpperLimit  LowerLimit  SensorReading [Table]  Id [PK]  SensorId [FK]  Value  LoggerReading [Table]  LocationId [FK]  Value  Alert [Table]  Id [PK]  AlertCorrectiveAction [Table]  AlertId [FK]  CorrectiveActionId [FK]  ByUserId [FK]  AlertAcknowledgement [Table]  AlertId [FK]  ByUserId [FK]  SensorAlertReading [Table]  AlertId [FK]  SensorReadingId [FK]  LoggerAlertReading [Table]   AlertId [FK]   LoggerReadingId [FK] codepre  pNow the problem with this option is that it allows readings from multiple sensors and multiple locations to be linked to a single alert.p  pTo expand on why this is a problem, I will explain how the system worksp  pA location can contain many live sensors, but only 1 logger.  For this reason I put the logger attributes into the location table it was effictively a 1 to 1 relationship.  A logger collects readings until it is later collected, live sensors communicate readings immediately via a network and they have extra attributes like network slaves which have network address attributes.. so fairly different to loggers I tried treating loggers as sensors at one point, didnt work out well.p  pWhen a sensor or logger goes out of range indicated by the reading the system generates an alert.  The alert is for that sensor only and is considered active until a reading for that sensor or logger indicates that it is back in range.  Until that time, readings that take the sensor further out of range are linked to that same alert.p  pSo as you can see, a single alert should really only have readings for the same sensor linked to it, however my design above allows different reading from different sensors and loggers to be associated with the same alert  should I be bothered that I havent constrained that somehow  The other problem is that it allows alerts to exist without having any readings.p  pHence my question just how far should one go with constraints or bending a design to fit those constraints  I like the design above because it is simple  alerts can have sensor readings and logger readings, so its a simple relation to link them.p  pI cant help thinking Im missing a trick too  is there just a much better way to do this design  Ive gone round in circles with it for ages now and there always seems to be a compromise unless I repeat all the alert tables for the different reading types.p  pThanks.p

I want them all to redirect to domain.com. Ideally I dont want to have to put the correct domain name in the .htaccess file, because then Id have to modify each sites .htaccess file seperately. Perhaps this is the only way, as the .htacess file would have no way of knowing the correct domain name is that true I thought of adding a short php snippet at the top of each page to redirect to the correct domain name a short config file is prepended to each html file anyway, but thats probably not great practice.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 119 pIm having a strange problem with my WCF service that returns data in JSON format. My scenario is this...I want to return information about a Customer based on the request sent by client. p  pClient can request what fields of information about a customer they need and the service needs to send only that information about the customer.p  pFor Ex If client asks for a list of customers and says they want firstname, lastname, city of each customer then server should send a json response with each field name and corresponding valuep  pSomething like... p  p[firstnamejohn,lastnameGoodman,city NY,  firstnamebrad,lastnamenewman,city LA]p  pif client asks for list of customers with ID and city fields only then the response should look like thisp  p[id 1234,city NY,  id1235,city LA]p  pMy initial design was to implement a Customer class and then have each possible field as a field of this class. Then inside my service method, I was getting the list of fields specified by the client and instantiating customer objects with only those properties set.p  pMy operation contract looks like thisp  p[OperationContract]         [WebGetBodyStyle  WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare, ResponseFormat  WebMessageFormat.Json, UriTemplate  Customersfieldsvalue]         List GetCustomersstring valuep  pBut the problem is when I decorate the class with DataContract and each Field as DataMember....if some properties are not set, they still get deserialized as NULL when sent to client. I dont want this to happen.p  pAlso, the list of possible fields a customer is very long and so the class became very large. I would rather store these fields as an enum collection in my service rather than fields of a class.p  pI then thought of having my Operation return a IDictionary and then add each field and value iteratively to this collection. That didnt work because, when a dictionary is serialized it shows Keydfas, Value34 etc etc. not what i wantp  pSo im kinda stuck. Whats the best way to solve this problem p  pCan I mark my [DataContract] such a way that if [DataMember] properties are not set i.e, null then they shouldnt be serialized and send to client at allp  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 119 pI got a problem with reading a text file, its not the reading its self that is a problem it is when I should read it.p  pI got a server program made by an external company so I got no control over it where you can put files in. The server sees a new file has arrived reads it and does things with it and then he puts a result back. So Im waiting for the file to be ready, but I cant read it to early cause I dont know if it exists already. So Im doing thisp  precodewhile IsFileLockedfile      Thread.Sleep25   private bool IsFileLockedFileInfo file      FileStream stream  null      try              stream  file.OpenFileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.None          catch IOException              return true          finally              if stream  null             stream.Close           file is not locked     return false  codepre  pNow this really helps to check if the file is readable and I never get any IOExceptions anymore when Im reading. Now I start the reading but sometimes I just read an empty file. And Im pretty sure it shouldnt be empty. Its not a bug of the server program Ill explain later.p  pHere is the code where the problem startsp  precodeusing StreamReader streamReader  file.OpenText      while streamReader.EndOfStream                here starts the reading       codepre  pBut when I use this code I dont get the problemp  precodeusing StreamReader streamReader  file.OpenText      Thread.sleep1000     while streamReader.EndOfStream                here starts the reading       codepre  pSo my guess is that the file is empty when I can open it but it has no text in it. I changed the Thread.sleep to 100 miliseconds and then I get the problem again. When I changed it to 500 the problem was solved again.p  pNow my software needs to run on a lot of different computers so I dont know how fast they are, but Im afraid if I set the timer to low I might get problems on other computers. But I dont want my users to be waiting for there info to long.  Is waiting the only option or is there another way Will there be a problem on other computers with different hardware configurationp  pEdit I tried FileSystemWatcher, and it is not the solutionp
Negative 119 pI created site A successfully in sitecore and has deployed to production, now I want to add another site B to the same sitecore instance. I am aware of how to do this, but I am not sure how I can separate the two sites code layouts, controls etc. so that one is not truly dependent on other. Instead of combining both the sites in the same site A project in visual studio, I was wondering if I can create a new project for site B but still reuse sitecore files that are in site As project What I am trying to understand really is the best practices in architecting multisite solutions in sitecore.

It is very important that packets arrive instantly. p  pThe problem is that every approx. 1000 packets I get a delay for about 2 seconds when receiving Packets. A delay of 100200 ms would be OK, but 2 seconds produce bad user experience. p  pI have the UDP communication in a separate Thread, so it is little affected by user interaction with UI and such.

Negative 119 pWhat is up to date best solution for rotating inner views when dealing with UITabBarController Im playing around with a standard app view hierarchy In my main app delegate file, Im creating UITabBarController, then, Im creating UINavigationController, filling it with a UITableViewController with instantiated custom subclass, and adding that UINavigationController to the first tab bar item. Now, I need UITableViewController to autorotate. I know that I need to implement shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation in all view controllers, therefore, I implemented it in my custom UITableViewController subclass implementation filep  precode BOOLshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationinterfaceOrientation     Return YES for supported orientations   return YES   codepre  pBut the UITableViewController is not rotating  .Now, I understand that there are UINavigationController and UITabBarController objects, that are sitting above my TVC but those two are instantiated directly not through a subclass, so there is no place where to return yes for autorotation. However, Im able to solve this problem by subclassing a UITabBarController and implementing shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation method in its implementation file.

Negative 119 pIm brand new to silverlight and looking for a little direction. I have a simple gallery app written with silverlight. Id like to be able to in this example, just ftp a xml or json file  to the server in a folder the app knows to look in, and have the silverlight app open the file. The file would contain a gallery category, its title desc, images and their title, desc. I would deseralize this data to use to show the new uploaded category. Ive done this sort of thing many times in wpf, but cant see to figure out the best way to handle this in silverlight. Thanks for any direction, and please let me know if I need to provide more info. Id also upload the images, the xml or json file would contain the information to link to them.p
Negative 119 pim developing a PHP web application and the main focus of the app is security. Until now ive stored the authentication data into 2 cookiesp  ul lione cookie for a unique hash string 30 charsli lione cookie for a unique id the primary key of the mysql database table which holds the cookie info and user idli ul  pDb tables look like thisp  ul liUsers stronguseridstrong, username, passwordli liCookies strongcookieidstrong, userid, hash, time, ipli ul  pWhen a user visits the page the app checks for existing cookies cookie check on the client and compares them to the database table Cookies. If the hash string and the id match, the session is extended and if they dont, the session is destroyed if exists and the user is prompted to login. It also checks if the session expired by comparing the current time stamp to the time stamp of the last activity.  p  pWhen the user logs in a hash strings is generated and stored in the database the current time stamp and IP is also stored. The primary id of the newly generated row and the hash string are then stored into two cookies and used for authentication. p  pI would like to implement additional security to prevent dictionary or brute force attacks, by throttling the login and cookie check attempts. Id like to achive that when the user fails N times to login or to validate cookies that he gets blocked for 20 minutes. But if i do this using the IP i would potentially block every user using that IP.p  pI could lock the specific user account when there are more than X failed attempts, but the problem is when the attacker doesnt supply a valid username so i would have to block the whole IP for N minutes. p  pThe login form has also a captcha check, but that just slows down a attack nothing compared to denying login attempts for X minutes.p  ul liIs there any other way of denying login attempts without blocking out the whole network using that IP li liShould i bother with denying login attempts when there are N failed cookie checks   li liIf the users cookies are stolen, i use the IP in Cookie table to prevent reusing it, so the cookies are usable only from the same IP as the users. Is this secure or should i do it somehow else li ul  pThanks in advance,p  pPS all passwords in database are hashed, the cookie values are encoded before used in a db query so injections arent possible.p
Negative 119 pI have what I feel to be a very simple scenario that I cant seem to figure out. Ive looked around here ie. StackOverflow.com for a solution, but cant seem to find anybody with my exact problem. Im not sorting my listbox on a criteria I simply want my listbox to reflect the order of the items in my collection.p  pIm using Caliburn.Micro to bind an underlying collection to a WPF ListBox. I simply want to be able to allow the user to move items up and down the list using buttons that Ive provided. The functionality works great However, the ListBox will not reflect the new collections order. p  pHere is a simple ViewModelp  precodepublic class MyViewModel  PropertyChangedBase    private readonly IObservableCollectionltSimpleItemgt items   private SimpleItem selectedItem    public MyViewModel        items  new BindableCollectionltSimpleItemsgt     items.Addnew SimpleItemItem 1     items.Addnew SimpleItemItem 2     items.Addnew SimpleItemItem 3      public IObservableCollectionltSimpleItemgt Items        get  return items        public SimpleItem SelectedItem        get  return selectedItem      set            selectedItem  value       NotifyOfPropertyChanged gt SelectedItem          codepre  pHere is the Xaml that binds to my ViewModel again, using Caliburn.Microp  precodeltListBox xNameItemsgt   ltListBox.ItemTemplategt     ltDataTemplategt       ltTextBlock TextBinding Captiongt     ltDataTemplategt   ltListBox.ItemTemplategt ltListBoxgt codepre  pThe results display the items in my ListBox perfectlyp  precodeItem 1 Item 2 Item 3 codepre  pNow, assume the user wants to move codeItem 2code above codeItem 1code.

What is the best way to tell the view that the listbox to refresh the display emwithoutem resorting to the codebehind p  h2UPDATE July 20, 2011h2  pI found the problem. The problem was that my collection of SimpleItems was actually a subset of a parent SimpleItem. Therefore, when the user clicked on MoveUp, I would do a lookup on the parent SimpleItem and reference its children directly. The problem was that the children were not bound to the IObservableCollection instance. I had to change my logic to find the observable collection instead and it works now Thank you devdigital for your helpp  p Lucp

Negative 119 pThis is somewhat related to my previous printing question re remote printing, which I resolved with help here at work.  This new situation likely has a simple answer as well, but I have yet to discover it.p  pTo simplify, I have two webpages written in ASP.NET with C codebehind, which we can call page1.aspx and page2.aspx.p  pThe first page, page1.aspx, is a simple search tool that opens a database and returns a list of reports matching the search criteria into a gridview.  The second page, page2.aspx, displays a report in the web browser, given the report ID as a query variable which I have working.  This page is also preformatted to be printer friendly.p  pOn page1.aspx, in my gridview, I have two buttons for each row labeled View and Print.  The View button will retrieve the appropriate order number for the corresponding row, and page2.aspx will load the report based on the order number again passed as a query variable.p  pFor the Print button, however, I would like to print.  That is, when the user clicks the button, instead of the page loading onto the screen, I would like for the Print dialog to pop up and allow the user to print the report directly to the printer since they are able to view the report using the separate button if they should so desire.p
Negative 119 pLet me see how well I can explain this. I am working on an index on a website that is in a div that is pushed off of the page via css margin with only part of it showing. When you hover over the part that is showing, the rest slides down into view. This works fine. I already have the transition effect in place for the margin change slide and also a background color change with rgba. It looks very nice.p  pMy question is, the index is around 500px wide and the visible part before hovering is 70px high. So that is a fairly large area of the screen for people to accidentally catch with their mouse hover if they are not trying to display the index div. Is there some way that I can only make part of the initially visible portion of the div activate the hover transition animation to bring the full div into view Or perhaps someway I can attach a smaller div to this one as a sort of tab, that will bring down the larger div and itself via transition on hoverp  pI hope this makes sense.

Negative 119 pI want to use three sections for a tableviewp  pNew Issues  issues reported on this date regardless of status. Active Issues  issues reported prior to this date still requiring follow up. Closed Issues  issues reported prior to this date, not requiring follow up.p  pI have a transient property which correctly reports the sections  0,1,2 respectively.p  pI have tried numerous ways to get my NSFetchedResultsController to sort the results correctly for the tableview to display. I find you cannot sort on the transient property in the NSFetchedResultsController so I tried to sort like sop  precode     create sort keys NSDateFormatter df  [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init] [df setDateStyleNSDateFormatterShortStyle] [df setTimeStyleNSDateFormatterNoStyle] NSString nowString  [df stringFromDate[NSDate date]] NSDate todayDateWithoutTime  [df dateFromStringnowString] [df release] NSSortDescriptor sortIsNew  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeydateReported ascendingYES comparatorid obj1,id obj2     NSDate date1  obj1     NSDate date2  obj2     NSComparisonResult comparisonResult     if [date1 timeIntervalSinceDatetodayDateWithoutTime]  0          if [date2 timeIntervalSinceDatetodayDateWithoutTime]  0              comparisonResult  NSOrderedSame          else              comparisonResult  NSOrderedAscending               else          if [date2 timeIntervalSinceDatetodayDateWithoutTime]  0              comparisonResult   NSOrderedDescending          else              comparisonResult  NSOrderedSame                   return comparisonResult ] NSSortDescriptor sortByFollowUp  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeyrequiresFollowUp ascendingNO] NSSortDescriptor sortByReportDate  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeydateReported ascendingNO] NSArray sortDescriptors  [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjectssortIsNew, sortByFollowUp,sortByReportDate, nil] [fetchRequest setSortDescriptorssortDescriptors] codepre  pNot so sure my usage of the block is correct, but in any case it never gets called so far as I can tell. I put some log statements in there and they do not report. Apparently the sortByFollowUp and sortByReportDate descriptors work as expected, but not the sortIsNew. If there are no new  Issues everything works fine. In any case where there are new Issues for that first section, the app crashes as the sorting does not match the sections.p  pI know I can do this very easily with straight up fetch requests and arrays. It only seems right to use the fetched results controller to avoid pulling the entire table of Issues into memory when most are unneeded and only a few will be displayed at any given moment. Can it really be this difficult to use it when you want custom sectionsp

Negative 119 pIm developing a distributed aplication, and i need to connect a client Java based to a server C based.

I have read that using sockets  threads is usually a good aproach for clientserver apps.p  pCould you please recomend me some web or book to read about this, or send me some example code to learnp  pDo you think that i should use other approach, better than sockets maybe a higher lvl library i would need it for c and java or a totally different wayp  pEDIT I will add some extra information.p  pWhat i would love to achieve is the followingp  pMy C program has a main loop, where i whould like to have a call like GetUpdatedDataFromRemoteDevice where i read the new values of some numerical variables that previously got updated from the net the socket, for example. Eventually, the C program will need to send a message to the remote device, to tell him to send other kind of data, and after that, keep getting the updated values.p  pFrom the Java program remote device the application running is an interactive touchable screen, that cant get blocked by the network transmisions, because it must keep working for the user, so all the networking should be done in a separated thread. That thread, should connect to the server, and when a button is pushed, start to send the data 4 changing numerical values in a loop until another event happens.p  pIt would be nice also to be easily reconectable to the server.p

Negative 119 pI have a basic question in Java, but its a general question in OOP. Why do interfaces allow fields to be set Doesnt that run contrary to what an interface is supposed to do p  pThe way I made sense of it, an interface is what in English would be an adjective. So, if my class implements the interfaces Runnable and Serializable, Im ensuring the user that my class will satisfy the conditions to be Runnable and Seriablizable. However, that would mean interfaces are stateless, but they are allowed to have fields in Java...p  pAm I missing somethingp

Negative 119 pOk so I found a hrefhttpfreespace.virgin.nethugo.eliasmodelsmperlin.htmm relnofollowthisa article and I am confused by some parts of it.  If anyone can explain this process in more depth to me I would greatly appreciate it because I have been trying to code this for 2 months now and still have not gotten a correct version working yet.  I am specifically confused about the Persistence part of the article because I mostly do not understand what the author is trying to explain about it and at the bottom of the article he talks about a 2D pseudo code implementation of this but the PerlinNoise2D function does not make sense to me because after the random value is smoothed and interpolated, it is an integer value but the function takes float values  Underneath the persistence portion there is the octaves part.  I do not quite understand because he adds the smoothed functions together to get the Perlin function.  What does he mean byadds because you obviously do not add the values together.  So if anyone can explain these parts to me I would be very happy.

Negative 119 pThis is more a conceptual question. Here is my current predicament I am writing a vb.net WPF application and using the MVVM pattern love it maintainability is just amazingly awesome. Currently all the code is written by hand and there is no use of NHibernate or Entity Framework as the backend is an access database due to policy I cannot use NH and EF doesnt support JET Databases, we may switch to MSSQL at some point but that may be a while from now.p  pThe application is running quite well and was wondering what is the best way to send updates back to the database.p  pCurrently the method is to add a boolean to a record on the set portion of the model to dirty then when update is pressed we loop through all the records that are dirty and use oledbcommand execute with parameters sql statements to update.p  pThis create an excellent separation of concerns but if this is the wrong way I would like to know alternatives please note the database type and the associated drawbacks such is it not working with EF.p  pThanksp  pFinal code in VB.NET after comments etcp  precodePublic Class Car Implements ICloneable  Public Property Make As String     Get         Return mMake     End Get     SetByVal value As String         mMake  value     End Set End Property Private mMake As String  Public Property Model As String     Get         Return mModel     End Get     SetByVal value As String         mModel  value     End Set End Property Private mModel As String  Public Function Clone As Object Implements System.ICloneable.Clone     Return New Car With        .Make  Me.Make,       .Model  Me.Model       End Function End Class    Public Class CarEqualityComparer Implements IEqualityComparerOf Car  Public Overloads Function EqualsByVal x As Car, ByVal y As Car As Boolean Implements System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparerOf Car.Equals     Return x.Make  y.Make AndAlso x.Model  y.Model End Function  Public Overloads Function GetHashCodeByVal obj As Car As Integer Implements System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparerOf Car.GetHashCode     Return 1 httpblogs.msdn.combjaredpararchive20080603makingequalityeasier.aspx End Function  End Class  Public Class CarRepository     Private carComparator As New CarEqualityComparer      Private cars As New ChangeTrackerOf CarcarComparator      Public Function GetCars As IEnumerableOf Car         TODO JETADO code here, you would obviously do in a forwhile loop         Dim dbId1 As Integer  1         Dim make1 As String  Ford         Dim model1 As String  Focus          Dim dbId2 As Integer  2         Dim make2 As String  Hyundai         Dim model2 As String  Elantra          TODO create or update car objects         Dim car1 As Car         If Not cars.IsTrackingdbId1 Then             car1  New Car         Else             car1  cars.GetItemdbId1         End If          car1.Make  make1         car1.Model  model1          If Not cars.IsTrackingdbId1 Then             cars.StartTrackingdbId1, car1         End If           Dim car2 As Car         If Not cars.IsTrackingdbId2 Then             car2  New Car         Else             car2  cars.GetItemdbId2         End If          car2.Make  make2         car2.Model  model2          If Not cars.IsTrackingdbId2 Then             cars.StartTrackingdbId2, car2         End If          Return cars.GetTrackedItems     End Function      Public Sub SaveCarsByVal cars As IEnumerableOf Car          TODO JETADO code here to update the item         Console.WriteLineDistinct  amp cars.Distinct.Count.ToString          For Each changedItem As Car In cars.GetChangedItems.Intersectcars             Console.WriteSaving              Console.WriteLinechangedItem.Make         Next          For Each newItem As Car In cars.Exceptcars.GetTrackedItems             Console.WriteAdding              Console.WriteLinenewItem.Make             Dim newId As Integer  CIntMath.CeilingRnd  5000 Random right now but JETADO to get the id later....             cars.StartTrackingnewId, newItem         Next          Dim removalArray As New ArrayList         For Each deletedItem As Car In cars.GetTrackedItems.Exceptcars             Console.WriteRemoving              Console.WriteLinedeletedItem.Make             removalArray.Addcars.GetIddeletedItem Cannot remove right as iterating through array  clearly that would be problematic....

The dictionary is to contain variable names keys and corresponding values numbers of various types.  The values come from pressing one of 3 special keys called Test 1, Test 2 and Test 3.  I can get the values into the dictionary the first time but cannot find a way to get them in there if the user presses a key for a 2nd or 3rd test.  I cannot seem to change the values in the dictionary or destroy the dictionary dealloc and release dont work with ARC turned on in XCode 4.3IOS 5 so I can create a new one.

Negative 119 pSometimes I find that Ive got a file that has over time grown to contain more classesfunctionswhatevers than I like. Its time to refactor I usually find in this case that my one file becomes several itself plus several other files, each containing distinct segments of the file.p  pUnfortunately, just creating these new files breaks history a bit  its hard to tell that those functions originally came from another file. Its even worse if there were any other changes made to the code during the refactoring.p  pOne of my coworkers found that he could abuse the rename functionality by doing something like thisp  precodehg rename after originalfile newfile1 hg rename after originalfile newfile2 hg rename after originalfile newfile3 hg add originalfile codepre  pThe result is that each of the new files looks like a rename with the rest of the file removed, and the original file looks like it lost the removed blocks.

Negative 119 pI have a bunch of textboxes on a page and a submit button. I have wired up the TextChanged event of the textbox to execute a serverside method. The user enters values into the textboxes, tabs out to the next textbox triggering the textchanged event and finally clicks the submit button which invokes another serverside method. All the functions are asynchronous. The submit method needs to be executed only after the textchange method is finished as they both share the same data. The issue is sometimes the textchange method takes slightly longer to finish, and the submit method is triggered before the textchange function is completed. How do I prevent this How do I lockqueue functionsp

Negative 119 pI have a performance question about Common table expressions in SQL Server. In our developer team we use a lot of chaining CTEs when building our queries. I am currently working on a query which had terrible performance. But I found out that if I in the middle of the chain inserted all the records up to that CTE in a temporary table instead and then continued but selecting from that temp table I improved performance significantly. Now I would like to get some help to understand if this type of change only applies to this specific query and why the two cases you will see below differ so much in performance. Or could we possibly overuse CTEs in our team and can we gain performance generally by learning from this casep  pPlease try to explain to me exactly what is happening here...p  pThe code is complete and you will be able to run it on SQL Server 2008 and probably 2005 too.

Negative 119 pI am testing different methods to initialise a large javascript array with zeros. So far a simple for loop with push0 seems to outperform the other approaches by far and large see a hrefhttpjsperf.cominitialisearraywithzeros relnofollowhttpjsperf.cominitialisearraywithzerosa, but I am having doubts about the validity of this test.p  pIn practice you would create such a large array only once and cache it, so that later when you need a large initialised array again you can simply slice it. Therefore I believe the most important evaluation is the time it takes the strongfirst timestrong this code is executed, rather than an average over many trials.p  pDoes anyone disagree Or does anybody know howwhere I can test the timings of only one roundp  pstrongEditstrong In response to some misconceptions as to the rationale of allocating an array with so many zeros I would like to clarify two things.p  ol liThere will be no sparsity. I need to create more than one large array and use them for computations. These copies will be filled with floats and the chance for a float to be exactly zero is negligible.li liNot all computations are performed sequentially over the array. I believe that a function that generates the array in the process would be inefficient compared to overwriting values in an array that is passed by reference see e.g. glmatrix.js.li ol  pMy solution is therefore to create one large zerofilled array once and then take a slice whenever a new array is needed, then pass that copy by reference to any function to work with it. Slice is superdupermega fast in any browser.p  pNow, although you may still have concerns why I want to do this, what I am really interested in is if it is at all possible to evaluate the performance of different initialisation methods at the strongfirst time runstrong. I want to have this timing because in my situation I will certainly only run this once.p  pAnd yes, my jsperf code likely misses some solutions. So if you have an approach that I didnt think of, please feel free to add it Thanksp

Negative 119 pThis is a curiosity question unless it proves to have created a memory leak, then its real.  I have often created custom UITableViewCells for my projects before ARC, but this is the first time Ive had an opportunity with ARC and Storyboards.  Its written often that the best practice with ARC when dealing with IB assigned views UITextField, UIImage, etc. that property that holds the reference be set to nil in the viewDidUnload override in the UIViewController.p  pMy question in this case is concerned when you subclass a UIView instead of a UIViewController.  For example the UITableViewCell.  I have set up a Custom table view cell in my prototypes and added some control views to it.  I then created a subclass of UITableViewCell and assigned it to the prototype for IB to return when it dequeues.  I created some IBOutlets and linked the control views to these IBOutlets.  All fairly typical stuff.  My question is that since I dont have anything to set the IBOutlets to nil, have I created a memory leakp  pThanks for any advice.p

Negative 119 pUpon installation of a Windows Service, an application is using a custom action to set the ServiceName and DisplayName of that service according to whatever the user enters into an install dialog text box.p  pIn testing this application it works fine for installation but when I try to uninstall the service I get an Error 1001. Service does not exist.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxqAQj.gif altenter image description herep  pwhich is ultimately not true because I can run it. So my present thinking is that i need to somehow access the custom name of the service and feed that to the uninstaller. I would have thought this was all GUID based and that the name would become largely irrelevant re uninstall but it would seem not to be the case.p  pSo how to do I resolve this problemp

Negative 119 pIve just set up MySQL on my computer OS X 10.7, and it seems to be working, judging by the mysqld in the activity monitor and the new icon in my System Preferences.p  pHowever Im having trouble doing anything with MySQL, as I need to login at least as the root user, but it doesnt let me.  So lets run through what Ive been doing and what error messages Im gettingp  pFirstly, I start up MySQL via the mysql unix executable file.  This seems to work, as my entries are now preceded withp  precode mysqlgt  codepre  pAlso, I can typep  precode help codepre  pand I get MySQLs help list.

I enter the followingp  precode mysql u root p codepre  pBut I get the 1064 error saying my syntax is wrong.  Ive had a look around through a number of websites, and this never seems to be a problematic step.  Any clues on whats going wrong for mep

Negative 119 pI recently came onto a project in which we have two applications that are virtually identical. We are using Django 1.4 and Postgresql 8.4. Both models have the followingp  precode  class Authormodels.Model     person  models.ForeignKeyPerson     book  models.ForeignKeyBook     order  models.PositiveIntegerFieldblankTrue,nullTrue     institute  models.ForeignKeyInstitution,blankTrue, nullTrue     rank  models.ForeignKeyRank,blankTrue, nullTrue    class Institutionmodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength200     parentinstitution  models.ForeignKeyself, blankTrue, nullTrue     location  models.ForeignKeyLocation, blankFalse, nullFalse     type  models.ForeignKeyInstitutionType, blankFalse, nullFalse    class Personmodels.Model     firstname  models.CharFieldmaxlength100     lastname  models.CharFieldmaxlength100     middlename  models.CharFieldmaxlength50,blankTrue,nullTrue     gender  models.CharFieldmaxlength1,choicesGENDERTYPE,blankTrue,nullTrue    class InstitutionTypemodels.Model     type  models.CharFieldmaxlength255 codepre  pIs there a way to easily merge the two, either through SQL or through Django Im not quite sure what the best approach would be. My only issue is that there is a lot of foreign key references. Is there a good way in which you could change the primary keys of one applications table to be higher than the other application essentially reassign primary keys in the second table starting where the first table ends and have them trickle down and then eventually merge the two tables Any sort of feedback would be much appreciated.p

Negative 119 pIve been using MacVim 7.3 Build 53 on OSX Snow Leopard and every so often, the window will simply disappear, losing any unsaved changes I may have.  It is always the active window if I have multiple windows open, they are unaffected and it doesnt completely quit MacVim since it remains open on the Taskbar, just with no open windows.  There are no warnings or errors of any kind.p  pNormally to debug a mysterious vim related issue I would start by taking everything out of my config files and build them back up bit by bit checking if the error is still there however this problem is quite intermittent and so far I cant force it to reproduce the problem, so Im not going to be able to tell for sure if the problem is fixed.p  pIve had a look for error logs and the such like but havent been able to find anything. Does anyone have any suggestions for debugging this kind of issuep
Negative 119 pI have an App that does forward geocoding get coordinates given address to display a bunch of pins on an codeMKMapViewcode. The app was developed well before iOS supported forward geocoding using a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationCoreLocationReferenceCLGeocoderclassReferenceReference.htmlcodeCLGeocodercodea first available in iOS 5. As such my app uses the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationgeocodinghlenGoogle Maps Geocoding APIa, which is generally very accurate. Given a full address with a street number it will generally give you the exact location of that address within a couple of metres.p  pIm doing some updates to my App to support iOS 6 and decided to switch from using the Google API to using codeCLGeocodercode provided the app was running on iOS 5 or above. However in my tests all with addresses in Portugal, where I live it is so inaccurate as to be totally unusable.p  pIm using a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationCoreLocationReferenceCLGeocoderclassReferenceReference.htmlapplerefoccinstmCLGeocodergeocodeAddressString3acompletionHandler3acode geocodeAddressStringcompletionHandlercodea and, for example, given the address Avenida da Liberdade 195, Lisboa, Portugal it gives me an Avenida da Liberdade in the city of Sintra, not Lisboa Lisbon. Thats about 15km away from the real address. Avenida da Liberdade is one of the biggest and most well known avenues in Lisbon. The equivalent of, say, 5th Avenue in NYC. Its not some obscure little side street.p  pIs there anything Im doing wrong to get such terrible accuracy Are others having similar accuracy issues, especially with addresses outside the USp  pFor the time being it looks like Ill have to stick with the Google Maps API. Incidentally, Ive been using the iOS 6 simulator and there the results are no better.

Does anyone know how to tell scipy to use a specific step size for each parameter Is there some way I can roll my own gradient function Is there a scipy flag that could help me out I am aware that this could be done with a simple parameter sweep, but I would eventually like to apply this code to much larger sets of parameters. p  pThe code itself is dead simplep  precodeimport numpy as np from scipy.optimize import minimize from ScannerUtil import straightenImg  import bson  def doSingleIterationparameters      do some machine vision magic      return the difference between my value and the truth value  parameters  np.array[11,10] res  minimize doSingleIteration, parameters, methodNelderMead,optionsxtol 1e2, disp True,ftol1.0, not sure if these params do anything print  print res codepre  pThis is what my output looks like.

Negative 119 h1Maintaining Clean Architecture in Spring MVC with a datacentric approachh1  pIm trying to map out the architecture for the frontend of a new Javabased web app portal type application we are making at work. I want to get this right from day one, and I would like to kick off a discussion here to help me implement Uncle Bobs a hrefhttpblog.8thlight.comunclebob20120813thecleanarchitecture.htmlClean Architecturea in my architectural design.p  pHeres a quick rundown of our tech stack, top to bottom the technology isnt importance, the structure isp  ul liOracle Databaseli liOracle Service Bus exposing services using WSDLsli liJAXWS generated Javaclasses from the WSDLs lets call this the generated service layerli liA Domain module consisting of POJOs mapped to the generated data objectsli liA Consumermodule exposing the generated service layer to the frontend applicationli liA Spring MVC based frontend module using FreeMarker to render the viewsli ul  pA key pointp  blockquote   pIn particular, the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity.p blockquote  pAttempting to adhere to Bobs Clean Architecture, Ive gone back and forth a bit with myself regarding where to place the emapplication logicem, namely the Use Caselayer in his architecture.p  pHere is the approach Ive come up withp  h2Layer 1  Entitiesh2  blockquote   pEntities encapsulate Enterprise wide business rules. p blockquote  pThis is where our Domain module containing the emdomainobjectsem lives, these are selfcontaining objects with minimal dependencies on each other. Only logic pertaining to the objects themselves may live on these domain objects, and no usecase specific logic.p  pAccess to our database is exposed via WSDLs using a service bus that transforms the data, as opposed to an ORM like JPA or Hibernate. Because of this, we do not have entities in the traditional sense with Ids, but a emdatacentric approachem making this layer a data access layer, presented to the rest of the application by the Consumermodule.p  h2Layer 2  Use Casesh2  blockquote   pThe software in this layer contains application specific business rules.p blockquote  pThis is where logic specific to our applications use cases lives. Changes to this layer should not affect the data access layer layer 1. Changes to the GUI or framework implementation Spring MVC should not affect this layer.p  pstrongThis is where it gets a little trickystrong Since our data access layer in layer 1 must be kept clean of application logic, we need a layer that facilitates use of that layer in a fashion that suits the use cases. One solution Ive found to this problem is the use a variant of the emMVVMpatternem that I choose to call emMVCVMem. See below for an explanation. The VMpart of this lives in this Use Caselayer, represented by codeViewModelcodeclasses that encapsulate this Use Casespecific logic.p  h2Layer 3  Interface Adaptersh2  blockquote   pThe software in this layer is a set of adapters that convert data from the format most convenient for the use cases and entities, to the format most convenient for some external agency such as the Database or the Web.p blockquote  pThis is where the MVCarchitecture of our GUI lives the MVC in our MVCVM. Essentially this is when the codeControllercodeclasses get data from the codeViewModelcodeclasses and puts it in Spring MVCs codeModelMapcode ojects that are used directly by the FreeMarkertemplates in the View.p  pThe way I see it, the servicebus would in our case also fall in under this layer.p  h2Layer 4  Frameworks and Driversh2  blockquote   pGenerally you dont write much code in this layer other than glue code that communicates to the next circle inwards.p blockquote  pThis layer is really just a configurationlayer in our application, namely the Spring configuration. This would for example be where we specify that FreeMarker is used to render the view.p  hr  h3Model View ViewModel Patternh3  blockquote   pMVVM facilitates a clear separation of the development of the graphical user interface either as markup language or GUI code from the development of the business logic or back end logic known as the model also known as the data model to distinguish it from the view model. The view model of MVVM is a value converter meaning that the view model is responsible for exposing the data objects from the model in such a way that those objects are easily managed and consumed.p blockquote  pMore on the MVVMpattern at a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiModelViewViewModelWikipediaa.p  pThe MVCVM roles would be fulfilled in our application like sop  ul listrongModelstrong  represented simply by the codeModelMapcode datastructure in Spring MVC that is used by the view templates.li listrongViewstrong   FreeMarker templatesli lipstrongControllerstrong Springs codeControllercodeclasses that directs emHTTP URL requestsem to specific emhandlersem and as such functions as a FrontController. The handlers in these classes are responsible for fetching data from the use caselayer and pushing it out to the view templates when showing dataHTTP codeGETcode, as well as sending data down for storing HTTP codePOSTcode. This way it essentially functions as a embinderem between the ViewModel and View, using the Model.pli lipstrongViewModelstrong  These classes are responsible for 1 structuring data from the data access layer in a fashion that is usable by the View and 2 treat datainput from the View. Treat means to validate and to break down the data so that it can be sent down the stack for storing. This layer would take form as codeltUseCasegtVMcodeclasses in a codeviewmodelcode package in our Spring MVC frontend module.pli ul  pA key component here is the implicit binding that happens in Spring MVC between codeModelMapcode and the FreeMarkertemplates. The templates only use the model codeModelMapcodes, where the controller has put the data in a format it can use. That way we can make templates like sop  precodeltbodygt   lth1gtWelcome userlth1gt   ltpgtOur latest product   lta hreflatestProduct.urlgtlatestProduct.nameltagt ltbodygt codepre  hr  pI apologize for the verbose explanation, but I could not explain this relatively simple architecture in fewer words. p  pI would greatly appreciate some input on my approach here  am I on the right track Does the MVCVM thing make sense Am I violating any Clean Architecture Principlesp  pThere are of course many solutions to this, but I am trying to find a solution that is 1 not overengineered and 2 adheres to the principles of Bobs Clean Architecture.p  hr  h2Updateh2  pI think the key issue that puts me off here is what form the Use case layer takes in this application. Remember we have an MVC frontend that gets data from a data access layer. If the MVC part fits in Bobs Interfaces adapters, and the domain models of the data layer fit in Bobs Entities layer, then what do I call the use case classes that implement application logic I am tempted to just call them codeltUseCasegtModelcodes and put them in the MVC project, but according to Bobp  blockquote   pThe models are likely just data structures that are passed from the controllers to the use cases, and then back from the use cases to the presenters and views.p blockquote  pso that means my model objects should be dumb like a simple codeMapcode. codeModelMapcode in Spring and it is then the responsibility of the controller to put data from the Use Case class into this Mapstructure. p  pSo again, what form does my Use Caseclasses take How about codeltUseCasegtInteractorcodep  pstrongBut in conclusionstrong I realize that the MVCMVthing is overengineering or simply incorrect  as mikalai indicates below this essentially just a twolayer applcation in its current form a data access layer and a frontend MVC layer. Simple as that.p

Negative 119 pWe have a multiwindow java application with a complex UI.  We want to migrate the architecture to a clientserver design by moving the data model and data management to a server and retaining everything else on the client.  So rather than reading data from the local network, the app is fetching data from the server.  I want to use the Play framework with bidirectional asynchronous sockets for handling the data transfers.  All Play examples have browserhtml views.  I havent found any examples where the client is a POJC plain ole Java client.  Play seems to be completely structured around browser clients.  Does anyone have an example of using a POJC instead  Or advice on designing views and controllers  My hope is to offer both solutions a POJC for multipanel desktop machines and a browserversion for mobile and tablet devices.  I would like therefore to design it so that the application will support both.   p

Negative 119 pArgh... Ive been struggling lately to make Visual Studio 2010 VC include a bunch of 3rd party libraries I wanna use in my project. Thats the issue The linker seems not to be able to determine every symbol that is generated in my code which come from the 3rd party libraries definitions. Ive included the header files path on my include directories and also the sources path on my source directory, but it is still not working. Ive googled it for a while and in most of cases, the issues is cause by a missing reference of the .lib file on linkers additional dependencies, however the library dont come with them.p  pHeres a piece of sample codep  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltfuzzyliteFuzzyEngine.hgt  int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      flFuzzyEngine eng     return 0  codepre  pSo thats the output VS showsp  precodeFuzzycolors.obj  error LNK2019 unresolved external symbol public virtual thiscall flFuzzyEngineFuzzyEnginevoid 1FuzzyEngineflUAEXZ referenced in function wmain Fuzzycolors.obj  error LNK2019 unresolved external symbol public thiscall flFuzzyEngineFuzzyEnginevoid 0FuzzyEngineflQAEXZ referenced in function wmain codepre  pSo i wonder if is there a way to build my sources with the .h and .cpp files of my 3rd party library.

Either write the pending model changes to a codebased migration or enable automatic migration. Set DbMigrationsConfiguration.AutomaticMigrationsEnabled to true to enable automatic migration. You can use the AddMigration command to write the pending model changes to a codebased migration.p  pI dont want to use change codeAutomaticMigrationEnabledcode to codetruecode, so I run codeAddMigration Testcode to see what is been created. The file created contains commands that were already applied by previous migrations to the database. If I try and run this last migration, codeUpdateDatabasecode fails something like Column already exists or Table already exists, which are the correct error messages since the migration has duplicated code.p  pI suspect the problem has something to do with the values the table codemigrationhistorycode saves on the Model column a binary representation of the model applied by the migration  maybe the value is not the correct value since a manual correction was made.p  pWhat can I do to be able to manually edit migration code and have it work properly What are the best practice when using Entity Framework Code First migrationsp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 119 pIm playing with Azure Worker Roles. When calling asynchronous WinRT methods and using the codeawaitcode keyword, the service execution is ended.

Negative 119 pSo at work I have been working for a few months on a OPOS driver for a few different things. I didnt create the project, but I have taken it over and am the only one developing it. So today I got curious about the way that it was done and I think that it may have started off on the wrong foot. I had to do a little bit of digging to find out that it uses the OPOS drivers from a company called MCS Monroe Consulting Services I downloaded 1.13 and installed the MSI version. I fired up VS created a new mfc dll. I then went to add a class. This is where I am confused.p  pIt doesnt matter if i choose Typelib or ActiveX it usually gives me the same list of interfaces that I can addextend fromwith one exception that comes to mind with MSR it has an events interface that I can extend And they both make the same header file in the case with msr it is COPOSMSR.h but one extends CCmdTarget, and the other extends CWnd. This is my first question. Which should I choose what is a typelib what is a ActiveX component and how do they differ from one another.p  pThe one ive been working on extends CCmdTarget. For the life of me I can not figure out how the driver knows to use one of the files USNMSRRFID but that is where all the development went into. I broke it up a bit so it wasnt just one huge file But that file doesnt extend COPOSMSR..it extends CCmdTarget as well. The only time i see anything mention the USN file is in MSRRFID.idl which confuses me even more Any one have clarity for thisp  pPart of me thinks this could make a very big impact when it comes time to deploy. A few of the test apps that have been written that make use of this driver require a somewhat confusing setup process that involves registering different drivers, copying files into a specific folder, setting up the registry and so forth. I think that if i can get a grip on what this all means and how to make a nice application that extends one of these OPOS devices properly that I could save my self further grief in the future.p  pAny tips or pointers Sorry if it is a newb question..but i am new to C. I started with Java then moved to C so some of this stuff is WAY over my head....p

Negative 119 pWeve inherited a PHP page which runs fine on Ubuntu, but dumps source code onto the display on a Windows 7 system running either XAMMP using PHP 5.4, or WAMP using PHP 5.3.p  pThe point where the dump occurs seems to be when it tries to parse a  object property character combination. When I change that to [] to access as an array element, it gets past that, but then dumps source code onto the display which appears after the  mapping character combination. Commenting that out doesnt work, only deleting the whole line gets it past there.p  pFinally, when its just printing out html with lt and  signs, that also causes the screen dump. If I replace those characters with the html entities, the source code doesnt dump any more, but the program doesnt display the menu and doesnt function at all. Note that I can successfully log into the app via its login page, although even that displays POST and some other lt and  characters in the username field.p  pIve tried running unix2dos on the whole app, but that didnt have any effect. Also tried converting the text of one of the offending pages to UTF8, but still no luck.p  pIn answer to some of the questions posed p  pThe working ubuntu version is PHP Version 5.3.101ubuntu3.1p  pThe first piece of code that works in Ubuntu and not in Windows is thisp  precodepublic function constructgid      thisgtid  gid     return thisgtretrieve  codepre  pwhere the code dump onto the display starts with p  precodeid  gid return thisgtretrieve  codepre  pYes, PHPInfo does work, showing for the WAMP server with PHP Version 5.3.13p  pI tried changing the  shortopentag but it made no difference. p  pThe product was written for us by an outsourcing group, and it appears to be based on some kind of framework. But I couldnt find any references to any of the classnames on Google, so maybe they wrote the whole thing inhouse. p  pGoing to the apache log, the actual error happens on this linep  precodeSESSION[admingid]  MembershipgetGrouprUser[id] codepre  pwhere the error message isp  blockquote   pMembership not foundp blockquote  pMembership is a class which is declared later in the same file as the one getting dumped on the display at the point shown above, so for some reason the PHP parser doesnt understand its reading PHP code from that point.p

Negative 119 pI am using the Spring JDBC template and a BoneCP Connection Pool. When I purposely set the JDBC URL to an invalid value to test how my system works on failed database connectivity, it throws an codeUnknownHostExceptioncode on server startup, but the server continues to start.  When I submit a request, the codejdbcTemplate.querysqlcode method hangs.  What is a good way to handle this so the system doesnt hang in codejdbcTemplate.querysqlcode  p  pThis scenario is possible if the database is down due to network connectivity issues. I tried to play around with the codeidleMaxAgeInSecondscode and codemaxConnectionAgeInSecondscode values I set them both to 10, but the code still hangs in codejdbcTemplate.querycode. p

Negative 119 pThis is pretty weird, but Im wondering if someone might have some insight here.p  pI am automating the creation of several subtasks on the creation of a certain issue type through the use of a Screen Scheme. This is working fine on the deployed instance of JIRA, but in order to test it, I dumped the database and imported it to a development instance.p  pSo, everything shows up fine the Screen Scheme, the fields, assigned to the right Project, etc., but when I hit the Create Issue button in the Issue creation screen, JIRA hangs up. Eventually it may finish, but even when it does, none of the subtasks are created.p  pFurther, not only is the new Issue type affected, but I can no longer create emanyem issues without JIRA hanging. Again, sometimes creating the Issue after several minutes, sometimes hanging beyond my level of patience.p  pHeres some logp  precode[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] Exception in thread QuartzWorker1

Negative 119 pI am currently designing a system where I have the following problemp  pI have a webapplication, running on an own Windows server. And i have an external client who has to communicate with the webapplication. The communication will go through XML files. The client is making one XMLfile with some data which the application has to read and process. My problem is that I have no idea if there are best practises for this problem. p  pI am thinking about the following solution for this problem The client is sending the XMLfile to a directory on the server. This directory is being watched by the application and when a new XMLfile is being added, an event occurs and the application knows that there is a new file and is going to read it and process the data. When data processing is finished, the application will remove the XML file.  p  pIs this the best solution or are there other solution for this problemp

But the problem for me is that I want wcf server to be host in WCF Service Host. Like if you create in VS any service libray from template it will be runned in WCF Service Host. Ive done next thing. I ve created new project service library and simply copy your service and contract to this new project. Then I copied app.config system.serviceModel section and added referenced to ClearUserNameBinding project and MyUserNameValidator. Thats all Next I run the client application. All was ok. WCF Service Host had been started and client application ended as I expected. But the problem is that now if I put a breakpoint somewhere in the service implementation let it be somewhere inside of the EchoString function and run again I always get message in VS IDE Unable to automatically debug WCFServiceLibrary. I really dont know what to do with this error and how to get rid of it, because I need the debugging to be available for me.p  pP.S. This error is appearing only when I use ClearUserNameBinding. If I use for example wsHttpBinding it works perfect. And of course I have codeltsystem.webgt ltcompilation debugtrue gtcode  turned on in my config filep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 119 pSo Im trying to get hot deploy to work on my maven project using netbeans. I have two war packages. One I call web and the other I call customweb. I overlay with the maven overlay plugin customweb on top of web. I have several customweb projects, one for each of my clients. So maven overlays were a good fit for my needs. p  pThe problem is I really, really want to get hot deployment of classes and static files .js, .css on both projects. But the hotdeployment only works on the customweb projects, if I modify a class or static file on web the changes are not reflected on the server unless I manually rebuild web and do a redeploy of the whole application which can take from 3 to 5 minutes, severely hindering my development.p  pIm using Netbeans with the deploy on save option and the apply code changes when in debug mode. Both do not work on web filesclasses.p  pIm looking for a solution. My customweb project will mostly have static files, but it can also have classes. It does not need to use overlays necessarily, but I cant figure out any other way to properly add two projects together without using overlays.p

When Touchdown is strongnotstrong installed, it works totally fine.  When Touchdown is installed, I tap the link, the page flashes, but goes back to the home screen.  I uninstall Touchdown, and it woks again.p  pIm assuming Touchdown does something to the webview control  Maybe Im missing something in the manifest to prevent other applications from changing the webview control Im using in minep  pA full link does work, eg... I tested codelta hrefhttpwww.google.comgttestltagtcode and that works with or without Touchdown installed.p  pAny help would be much appreciated  Thanks      p

Negative 119 pTo make this easier to understand We are using a database that does not have connection pooling built in. We are implementing our own connection pooler.p  pOk so the title probably did not give the best description. Let me first Describe what I am trying to do. We have a WCF Service hosted in a windows service that needs to be able to takeprocess multiple requests at once. The WCF service will take the request and try to talk to say 10 available database connections. These database connections are all tracked by the WCF service and when processing are set to busy. If a request comes in and the WCF tries to talk to one of the 10 database connections and all of them are set to busy we would like the WCF service to wait for and return the response when it becomes available. p  pWe have tried a few different things. For example we could have while loop yuckp  precode[OperationContractAsyncPatterntrue] ExecuteProgramstring clientId, string program, string[] args      string requestId  DbManager.RegisterRequestclientId, program, args     string response  null     whileresponse  null              response  DbManager.GetResponseForRequestIdrequestId           return response  codepre  pBasically the DbManager would track requests and responses. Each request would call the DbManager which would assign a request id. When a database connection is available it would assign say Responses[requestId]  [the database reponse]. The request would constantly ask the DbManager if it had a response and when it did the request could return it. p  pThis has problems all over the place. We could possibly have multiple threads stuck in while loops for who knows how long. That would be terrible for performance and CPU usage. To say the leastp  pWe have also looked into trying this with events  listeners. I dont know how this would be accomplished so the code below is more of how we envisioned it working.p  precode[OperationContractAsyncPatterntrue] ExecuteProgramstring clientId, string program, string[] args       register an event      listen for that event      when that event is called return its value  codepre  pWe have also looked into the DbManager having a queue or using things like PulseMonitor.Wait which we are unfamiliar with.p  pSo, the question is How can we have an async WCF Operation that returns when it is able top

Negative 119 pI need to copy an object. I tried using the IClonable interface, with no avail and the most sensable solution to me is to use unsafe code to create a pointer to the object and then write a method like Memcpy in C. The only problem is creating a pointer to a managed type. I am assuming that doing such will bring issues with the garbage collector, but if it is possible to use marshaling or something to create a pointer to a managed object then I could write a function like memcpy in C and just copy my object. If structs can be unmanaged then why cant objects An object is essentially a struct pointer so in theory it should be equal to size of an IntPtr right p

Negative 119 pI am currently doing research into which test framework I should be using for php. The two choices I have are PHPUnit and PHPSpec. I know that PHPUnit is TDDTest driven development and PHPSpec is BDDBehavior driven development. However due to the lack of any real PHPSpec tutorial and limited documentation on the PHPSpec site I am unable to come to a full conclusion. My question to everyone is what are some addition similarities and differences between the two frameworks Yes BDD and TDD are big ones but are there others And they seem similar but no one talks about their similarities in great detail. Thank you. p

The purpose of the counter is to indicate how often a blog post is read, like StackOverflow shows viewed n times on question pages.p  pFirst I wanted to store the counter data in files but through research I changed my mind to use MySQL with several InnoDB tables as these perform faster than HDD lookups, are less laborious in the long run and ship with useful functions natively.p  pThe problem Im stuck at is stronghow to only count up once per userstrongp  pRestricting IPs is not a solution, because of dynamic IPs and networks mostly having a single IP sharing the connection with all connected devices e.g. school, office, public access points.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pInspired by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma175153712493918fidelopers answera Im noodling over a session based solution.p  pIm using a separate database table for sessions already, so Ill incorporate this into the solution as suggested.p  pThis is what I have got so far using a hrefhttplaravel.com relnofollowLaravel 4a with a hrefhttplaravel.comdocseloquent relnofollowEloquent ORMap  pstrongSQL Tables Setupstrongp  precode   Sessions Table   CREATE TABLE sessions      id VARCHAR255 NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     payload TEXT NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     lastactivity INT11 NOT NULL,      UNIQUE INDEX sessionsidunique id  COLLATEutf8unicodeci ENGINEInnoDB     Views Table   CREATE TABLE postviews      id INT11 UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,     postid INT11 UNSIGNED NOT NULL,     sessid VARCHAR255 NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     viewedat TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT NULL,      PRIMARY KEY id  COLLATEutf8unicodeci ENGINEInnoDB     Posts Table   CREATE TABLE posts      id INT11 UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,     userid INT11 UNSIGNED NOT NULL,     title VARCHAR255 NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     excerpt TEXT NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     slug VARCHAR255 NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     content LONGTEXT NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     ...      views INT10 UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,      PRIMARY KEY id  COLLATEutf8unicodeci ENGINEInnoDB codepre  pbr  strongPHP Views Counter Classstrongp  precodeltphp namespace ServicesPosts    Blog Post Views Counter     Using Laravel 4 with Eloquent ORM    class ViewsCounter       public postid             Sets the post id              param  int id       return void           public function setPostIDid              thisgtpostid  id                  Handles the view count              return bool  True or false on failure           public function countView               Get the post data from the db         try                      post  PostfindOrFailthisgtpostid                  catch IlluminateDatabaseEloquentModelNotFoundException e                      return false                    Get the current session id         sessid  sessionid           Check if this view was already counted by           looking up the session id in the views table         postviews  PostViewswheresessid, , sessid                             gtwherepostid, , thisgtpostid                             gtremember10                             gtfirst           The sessid was not found so count the view         if emptypostviews                      postviewsgtpostid  thisgtpostid             postviewsgtsessid  sessid             postviewsgtviewedat  dateYmd His             postviewsgtsave               A cronjob is run every 24 hours to count the views per               post and update the count values in the posts table.

Negative 119 pIts a pretty common thing to have to send mails from your app and in most cases its a real pain in the ... you know where.p  pSo what Im doing is taking Apache Commons Email which is based on top of the official java mail api and Im sending out email in the most simple way there is, i.e. without authenticating to a smtp server. I just do a simple MX lookup on the destination hostname, get the MX servers and try to drop my message at the first one whether the mail gets rejected or not is a completely different issue and I might sometime soon ask a further question about the whole mess up with returnpath vs. from vs. replyto and the way these headers are not handled in java. Back to business... So Ive just tried to drop my Message at the mail server with the least preference score.p  pHere is an example I want to write to coderecipientdomain.comcode. The MX Lookup tells me that codedomain.comcode is aware of two MX servers and these are e.g. codemail1.domain.comcode with preference 10 and codemail2.domain.comcode with preference 20. The rfc way to do things is to go to the server with the least preference and drop the mail there. So thats what I do.p  pAnd finally my problem What happens if that server is not available in some way or another Its pretty simple  I go to the other server, but Apache Commons and I suspect java mail api doesnt allow me to do just that. The codemail.smtp.hostcode variable is rooted inside the props of the session in the message in the email. And I cannot get at it. p  pSo whats the best way to handle this problem Should I build my Email completely from the top with the new hostname mail2, or is there some clever way to make this all work in java without much painp

I need this as a string and have tried the following.p  precodeNSString url  [tweet valueForKeyPathentities.urls.displayurl] codepre  pI can NSLog this as well and I get the proper information.  But I think it comes out as an Array  The NSLog looks like this..  url is  url goes here .  With the brackets and quotes.  This is not a string like the others.  I am assuming it is because of the valueForKeyPath.  When I tried to use url hasPrefix, it doesnt like that and mentions you cant have hasPrefix with and array.  But I also tried to use multiple objectForKey with entities, urls, and displayurl.  But this does not work.  Is there any way to get my entry into a string format.  I have looked over some SO questions and on the web, but cant find anything that is useful for me.  Any help will by much appreciated.  Thanks for your timep

Negative 119 pWhat i need  1. Send messages through jms.  2. Have messages persisted so that if not handled from client and server restarts client gets the message on server restart.  3.

Messages using this configuration are not received in order. This makes sence given the xsd comment in listenercontainer.concurency keep concurrency limited to 1 in case of a topic listener or if message ordering is important. So question is howif i can keep order but have multiple consumers. p  pb. message acknowledgement. What i need is that after message has been processed, onMessage returns, only then message is considered as acknowledged and not retransmited. I have no transactionmanager in terms that i am not inside any application server and wish to avoid this if possible. i only need to acknowledge messages my self. Is this possiblep

Negative 119 pAs part of a coding challenge I have to implement a dungeon map.p  pI have already designed it using codeData.Mapcode as a design choice because printing the map was not required and sometimes I had to update an map tile, e.g. when an obstacle was destroyed.p  precodetype Dungeon  Map Pos Tile  type Pos  Int,Int  cartesian coordinates data Tile  Wall  Destroyable  ... codepre  pBut what if I had to print it too  then I would have to use something like  codeelaboratePrint . sort  fromList dungeoncode where codeelaboratePrintcode takes care of the linebreaks and makes nice unicode symbols from the tileset.p  pAnother choice I considered would be a nested list p  precodetype Dungeon  [[Tile]] codepre  pThis would have the disadvantage, that it is hard to update a single element in such a data structure. But printing then would be a simple one liner codeunlines . map showcode.p  pAnother structure I considered was codeArraycode, but as I am not used to arrays a short glance at the hackage docs  i only found a map function that operated on indexes and one that worked on elements, unless one is willing to work with mutable arrays updating one element is not easy at first glance. And printing an array is also not clear how to do that fast and easily.p  pSo now my question  is there a better data structure for representing a dungeon map that has the property of easy printing and easy updating single elements.p
Negative 119 pI have just hit another bump in the road along my journey with Scheme. Its probably safe to say my table has had enough of me banging my head into it... I have written a function to find the min and max number within a list for class homework. The logic is sound i think so... and everything works fine, however, only the value of the first function call is returned from the define iterator aList minNum maxNum. What I am noticing with the debugger is that after every recursion  function call I see using DrRacket that function call being pushed to the stack. Once the recursion happens for the last time and the code jumps down to the return of list minNum maxNum it doesnt return what it should, as I can see the values are correct, instead I see the function calls coming off the stack one by one until it gets to the very first one. Thus the initial values which would be the first two values form the list are returned instead. I know the stack is FIFO, however, I am not even trying to push anything to the stack. In theory I just want to call the function again and keep passing values back up... Any guidance on this would be much appreciated.p  precode define findMinMax aList   define iterator aList minNum maxNum    whennotnull aList     cond     gt minNum car aList      set minNum car aList     lt maxNum car aList      set maxNum car aList    iterator cdr aList minNum maxNum    list minNum maxNum  cond  setting the first two atoms in a list appropriately to the min and max variables.  lt car aList carcdr aList   iterator cdr cdr aList car aList carcdr aList  gt car aList carcdr aList   iterator cdr cdr aList carcdr aList car aList  else   iterator cdr cdr aList car aList carcdr aList codepre

Negative 119 pI was going through an article on linux kernel radix tree implementation, link of article is mentioned belowp  pa hrefhttplwn.netArticles175432 relnofollowhttplwn.netArticles175432ap  pIn this article it mentions that radixtreepreload allocates sufficient memory so that the subsequent insertion in tree will not fail. Although it allocates the structures on perCPU basis and hence the function returns with preemption disabled. It is the reponsibility of the caller to call radixtreepreloadend in order to enable the preemption.p  pMy question isp  p1 Why radixtreepreload allocates the structure on perCPU basisp  p2 When is the user supposed to call radixtreepreloadend Is it immediately after radixtreeinsert p  p3 Does it not affect the performance as the radix trees are used for page cache operations and hence any insertion will cause the preemption to be disabled Correct me if my understanding is wrong.p

Negative 119 pIs it possible to create a simple Thread, which runs a SQL statement, and then close the application but let that thread run untill it is finished main form still closes normally  doesnt wait for thread to finish.p  pIm upgrading an application which writes some test data to a log file and I want to bulk insert that log file into a database. Because there is a lot of data and the sql stored procedure which handles it takes a minute or two to complete Ive made a thread which runs the stored procedure. This thread is run every so often during the lifetime of the app but now I want to implement so that after the user is finished with testing and closes the app, the rest of the data in the log that isnt on the server yet is synced. This way I can avoid checking logs of previous days if all data is synced.p  pIf I use codewaitforcode function, the whole application wont close untill the stored procedure is finished which is undesirable, because there is nothing the app has to do afterwards. The stored procedure handles all the errors so there is no need to handle errors in the app.p  pIf I remember correctly this is something that is done a lot in linux, a procedure creates another procedure and then ends and the child proc is then orphaned, it is how demons are run. But I have no idea if this is even possible on windows.p

Negative 119 pI am new to MVC as well as C.  Im familiar with Progress, and find the complexities of .Net to have it uses, but I probably wont need everything.  p  pOver the last few months, I have been learning MVC and Ive written several programs, but my technique has been top down what do I need  ok let me learn how to do this.  While this has allowed me to make progress, I dont feel like I have a very solid understanding of C.  With this concern Ive spent some time attempting to learn c without the focus of MVC.  What Ive discovered is that most lessons have the goal of teaching you every abstract process rather than focusing on problems.  For example, I probably wont really have a need to use any of the graphical tools, the apps Ill be building will be more on the business side, so calculations, data manipulation, relating many tables to many tables.  p  pMy question is this.  Is there a way to learn C out there that focuses on realworld business problems as a technique to teach the language or only this let throw everything out there and see if people can gather what they need.  I learn by doing, by having a problem and finding the solution, so most books are some what confusing for me or more to the point  boring.  For example  threading may be useful, but I dont know why I need to learn that before I learn how to import a csv file, run the parsed data through a few filters, and export the data to a new file.  p  pId like an approach similar to how people learn a new language.  Rather than learn the structure of a language and all the rules, I want to learn as if I was thrown into a culture and heard the conversational most used aspects first.  I know I have rambled, but any ideas would be appreciated. p

Negative 119 pOk so sorry if this is a noob question, but this is the first time making a game and I just want to know how to call in the gameloop, I have it created in my Keylistener class, but whenever I run it it just freezes due to an infiniate while loop in the run method, but I would also like to have it called when the game is started so I can see the ticks fps throughout the entire game, heres my code if you guys need any other classes please say so thanks  to be easier Im just going to show the keylistener class so its not a lot of code for you to sort through, and just so you know the way I made my grid was using an array of JLabels called WizardCells just so you know and I used imageicons for the icons I did not use BufferedImage, anyway I think thats all you need to know

Negative 119 pI am writing a module in C and It requires to use SQL transactions as it has more DML operations and I am not using stored procedures because the current module involves the dependencies on other modules.p  pThe dependent modules take in a SQL connection as a parameter and receive it from callee. Now the problem is, Ive already set up a transaction to a connection, which I could not use that in dependent modules because it has no transactions.p  pNow should I make the dependent modules transaction specific or should I create new connection for dependent modules. p  pAny suggestions would be helpful.p
Negative 119 pSo I have read hundreds of threads. I gave up on gifs because how they are poorly supported cross browser the default min fps is 410 depending on the browser and there is no reset gif or play when loaded that works. SO I have decided to have some fun with an animated rig using javascript. I had noticed that Safari sucked in the fps on one thing I did before, but never thought much about is since I figured I did something wrong...p  pSo I made this site using setIntervals, minimized the total number, clearIntervaled them using the var they were set to, and even tried not declaring them as global vars...i.e.p  precodeltscriptgt      var bob setIntervalfps,100      var going0        fps           ifgoinglt10                going                document.getElementByIdid.style.top1goingpx                document.getElementByIdid.src.elementspicgoing.png                       else              clearIntervalbob           ltscriptgt codepre  pThat worked perfectly on IE, but safari decided that 100  1 sec I checked many sites and there were people complaining about it with no response or people talking that Safari and Chrome have better fps. So I redid the entire thing first reduing the total number of active setIntervals and then converted it over to...p  precode requestAnimFrame codepre  pAnd then to ...p  precoderequestAnimationFrame codepre  pbut after all of that it still barely moves on Safari. I love how it runs on IE, and I figure the next step is to make a browser dependent variable that multiplies everything only is it is on safari...but I have a feeling that may not work either because perhaps it is just a memory issue, which sucks because as I understand it setInterval runs less often than requestAnimationFrame so it would seem a better choice. p  pI can put my code here, but it is a bit much and I figured that the specific code may be less important, but the page is a hrefhttpcraibwoud.comindex relnofollowcraibwoud.coma.

Negative 119 pIm not sure if Ive chosen a proper title for this question or not. Anyway Im developing a WPF application and I need to know whether there are any approach to simulate a windows store Window in WPF application or notp  pTo be clear I should say in window store apps you can access the open apps by moving the mouse cursor to the topleft corner of the screen. This is also possible in WPF apps only if the WindowState is not Maximized. If you set the WindowState to Maximized you dont have any access to anywhere else except your own application.p  pPlease let me know if I havent explained this issue clearly. Any idea is appreciated. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 119 pJust wondering if anybody has faced this issue.It does not seem to be package specific and is sporadic. I simply start my SSIS debugger in Visual Studio. The debugger loads and does nothing, I know the package is running  because I can see the DTSDebugger in the Task Manager and if I let it run long enough it completes. But I dont get the tick marks or the record counts etc. I have to close my Visual Studio and open it again and it works fine. Please feel free to comment if any information is needed.p

Since you are making this field nullable, you MUST specify a default   value to use for existing rows. Would you like to    1. Quit now.    2. Specify a oneoff value to use for existing columns now    3. Disable the backwards migration by raising an exception you can edit the migration to fix it later   Please select a choice  codepre  pThis is confusing to me. And yes I have read the south docs.p  ol lipFirstly, why is it saying codeLocation.region does not have a default specified, yet is NOT NULL.code The alterations I made to the field ARE making it the case that it is null, what gives An explanation would be great.pli lipWhy do I need to specify a default Once I specify this default where does it live In an SQL table Does this matter if I have existing data or is this simply for the scheme itselfpli ol  p3.I sort of understand option 1,2 but what exactly would option 3 do Why is it usefulp  pThank you tremendously.p

Negative 119 pI want to use an IF statement with a Boolean OR to evaluate a variables value using both strings and integer classes. Here is my code for one of several different switchesp  precodeif autoSelectmode  Search or 1     return position1 elif autoSelectmode  Verify or 2     return position2 elif autoSelectmode  Track or 3     return position3 codepre  pThe code runs without error, but seems to ignore this switching logic altogether and selects switch position 1 regardless of my initial values. Simulation is interrupted presumably when all code has been executed with a prompt to Continue, Reset or Stop Simulating. If my code is legal then I would expect the simulation to keep running until I override the code with a manual switch position setting.p  pThe reason I want to use this mixed class technique is so that a config file which runs the simulation can be set up with either integers for switch positions or strings for the actual human readable textual values of these variables. Whichever class is chosen for the config file, that class would be used when setting the initial values.p  pThank you.p
Negative 119 pIn our project we are using Bootstrap WYSIWYG plugin a hrefhttpmindmup.github.iobootstrapwysiwyg relnofollowhttpmindmup.github.iobootstrapwysiwyga and we are facing a problem with Internet Explorer. Although not officially supported, everything works in IE10 except the bundob and bredob actions. This plugin relies on codedocument.execCommandcode to execute all the actions the user needs.p  pYou can test the issue in the demo editor in the plugins site. Making some debug if you click the undo button you can see that codedocument.execCommandundocode is called but nothing happens. However if you type the command in the console it does undo the last action.p  pI was thinking if this was an IE problem as this works perfectly on Chrome and FF, but  execCommandundo actually works  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netc8mq21 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netc8mq21ap  pAs we are using Backbone.js and in order to clarify wether if this was a plugin issue or not we dettached the undo button from the plugin and created a custom event like followsp  pBackbone Viewp  precodeevents                     click undoAction undoAction     ,  undoAction function e          e.preventDefault         document.execCommandundo      codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv classbtngroupgt lt undo dettached from plugin gt      lta classbtn idundoActiongtlti classiconundogtltigtltagt lt redo keeps attached to plugins dataedit attribute gt      lta classbtn dataeditredo gtlti classiconrepeatgtltigtltagt ltdivgt codepre  pHowever no luck here neither, it seems it is not a plugin issue. What can be affecting to the IEs undoredo stack that does not allow execCommand to work properly under some circumstancesp  pI cannot think on a different and straighter way of calling the execCommandundo as in the last Backbone example. Any light on this would be highly appreciatedp  pstrongUPDATE New findingsstrongp  pI found a way to make the undo action work and maybe this can show what is happening, but still dont understand why you can try this in the bootstrap wysiwyg demo page above  p  ol liClick on the textarea and input some text. li liClick on the undo button li liResult strongnothing happensstrong. li liClick on the textarea again. li liMove the cursor to the undo button dont click on it yetli liType some text without moving the cursor from the button.li liClick on the undo buttonli liResult strongIT WORKSstrongli liRepeat steps 6 and 7 without moving the cursor and it will still work. li ol  pIt seems that hovering the cursor into the undo button breaks the undoredo stack and thats what makes document.execCommandundo stop working properly on those cases. Is there any way to query that stack and see what is actually happeningp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 119 pstrongHello everyonestrong I am developing an android application which use webview because it offers the possibility to interact automatically with a specific website thanks to javascript. The part of the website i am concerned with works that way I have a form which contains two field those fields correspond to two code. I am able to fill only the first field at the beginning. Once i have submitted the first value of the form, then i am able to fill the second form if the code i entered in the first place is correct. If it isnt the right code, then the first field returns empty again but the url remains the same. p  pSo I get the first code value from another activity and then i want to automatically fill the first field, submit the form and check if the first field remains empty or not. If not i go to the next activity, and if it remains empty i go back to the previous activity.p  pI know how to fill the field and submit the form, i know how to check if the field remains empty or not, but i dont succeed in making those methods working together the field is filled, the form submitted, but it looks like the field is always empty, as if the code was always wrong even when the code is actually the right code. p  pI am using the strongonPageFinishedstrong method from the webviewclient, and i have try to use strongonPageStartedstrong and strongshouldOverrideUrlLoadingstrong but it seems that those method arent executed at all. Maybe the execution of javascript is too fast or something i am a beginner in Javascript.p  pstrongAny idea on how this could work  I am really stuck here ....strong p  pemps Sorry for my bad english,

Negative 119 pIm trying to move my code from c to java and its the first time im trying to write java code.p  pFirstly i noticed that a Listlt in c is not as a list in java where i had to use an arrayList instead so i just changed p  precodeListltInstrumentsgt instruments  new ListltInstrumentsgt codepre  pto p  precodeListltInstrumentsgt instruments  new ArrayListltInstrumentsgt  codepre  pand that solved that.p  pLater on in my program i have a for loop which runs though the List of an abstract Instruments class and compares an enum saved in .type value which all the subclasses have. IEp  precodepublic static int HowManyOfTypeInstrumentType TP      int HowMany  0     for int i  0 i lt instruments.Size i              if instruments[i].type  TP         HowMany          return HowMany  codepre  pHowever im getting the message Array Type expected. This problem wouldnt occur in c because the property is stored in the abstract class and it would just do the comparison without needing to know the type of subclass that was stored. Im guessing that its not that simple in java. Is there a was around this Thanksp
Negative 119 pIve created a struct and the struct has a metric on it. I am generating a series of these structs and I want to sort them into an array based on this metric. Basically, if the metric is 0, I want it in the list in the [0] slot of the array, if the metric is 14, I want it in the list in the [14] slot of the array. The bound on the metric size of the array is variable based on the same variable that the structs are generated off of, so I need the array to be declared dynamically with malloc. Ive been experimenting with how to get this array of lists of my struct. I cant figure it out. Ive googled the problem and havent been able to come up with a solution.p  pAlso, once I have the array, how do I add another element to the list of a particular array cell And then go back through and compare all elements of the list in the i th cell to the elements of the nith cellp  pEdit It may also help that not all of the metrics will have elements.p  pEdit 2 Ive tried this and it seems to have some problems.p  precodelistltspairgt pairs pairs  listltspairgt mallocsizeoflistltspairgt  N  1  j   a, b  pairs[m].pushbackj codepre  pwhere m is the metric for j which is of type spair.

Negative 119 pUsing Cocoas Security frameworks code signing functions like codeSecCodeCheckValiditycode I can quite easily check if my Mac OS X application binary which I sell through the Mac App Store has been tampered with.p  pIm pondering if I should utilize an invalid code signature as an indicator that my app has been pirated. I probably would not right away prevent such an app binary that has been tampered with from being executable, but maybe show an informative message to the user.p  pHowever, why doesnt Mac OS X itself honor broken code signatures as a possibly severe problem At least at the moment, apps with invalid code signature still launch without noticing the user in any way. My guess is that they dont really enforce code signature checks yet other than for identity confirming uses because an invalid code signature doesnt really guarantee that it has been broken by a malicious attempt  it could have simply been caused by a faulty file transfer or similar.p  pSo I guess my question is really what other Mac OS X developers are doingp  pstrongDo you use code signature checks to try to prevent App Store fraudstrongp  pAnd if so, how do you make sure that the signature breaks cause is maliciousp  pThank you for any insightsp

Our prefered flow would be as followsp  ul lia user creates a token for an application REST Apili liusing this token the user can request a temporary access token like the CAS tokenli liin each request to the REST Api, the user includes the temporary access token either as a HTTP Header or a request parameterli lithe REST Api application checks the provided temporary token against the CAS server for validityli ul  psounds like OAuth, which CAS server does support, except that the user is not asked for a credentials at any time, but wed also like to provide authentication for services i.e., other applications calling our APIsp  ul lideveloper asks for a REST Api token which is associated with a CAS userli liapplication requests a temporary access token using the Api tokenli lifurther requests to the Api include the temporary access token either as a HTTP header or a request parameterli liREST Api application checks temporary access token against CAS server for validityli ul  pWe want our REST Api applications to know nothing about user credentials, they dont even have access to the user database, which works just fine for humans using the application redirect to CAS login page.p  pI dont know how we can implement this flow without having to heavily customize CAS server and implement this behavior by ourselves.p  pGoogle uses JWT for a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsOAuth2ServiceAccounthlde relnofollowOAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applicationsa, which seems like the way to go.p  pId appreciate it if anyone can provide some hints or alternatives to CAS server. Maybe someone has already implemented this pattern using CAS server and can provide some information on this issue.p  pBest Regards, Marcop

Negative 119 pI was able to create an instance in Openstack specifying multiple networks. Instance has two network interfaces and each is assigned a private IP as  expected. Additionally I was able to assign a floating IP successfully. The floating IP is always assigned to the first interface eth0. What I want to know is how to specify a a network interface of my choice to which the floating IP is assigned. p  pI noticed that portUuid can be specified in nova NetworkInterface. But my issue is how to get the portUuId of the network interface I wantp  pAny help is appreciated.p
Negative 119 pI try two get an Sliding Drawer appearing on all Activities. Therefore I built an BaseActivity which extends my child class MainActivity. I used a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4922641slidingdrawerappearinallactivities49227404922740thisa code for combining the layouts. This works well, both the layouts appear on my child activity. I implemented a list view for my drawer and some onItemClick Listenere etc. But none of these are executed in my child class. I got an empty drawer. Strangly every toast i put in whatever method of the BaseActivity appears on the screen.p  pbactivitybase.xmlbp  precodeltFrameLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid

Luckily, my tables DO have the same number of columns. Column count is a constant. However, year to year, there is a divergent number of rows. So for table 0, it lists all the possible referral places ie Google, Facebook, Blog etc. It does a similar thing for tables 1,2,3. BUT each year, or even month to month, another row might be added. So now table 0 for 2014 has 3 other referral types, or perhaps 3 new ones and 1 that is no longer there ie Twitter, Pinterest, Bing are now in the rows but Blog is no longer a referral for this year. p  pI need a more robust way of adding the datatables together so that if one datatable has 30 rows and another has 15, it will add together the ones that match and leave the others alone.

Negative 119 pIn most 3D platform games, only rotation around the Y axis is needed since the player is always positioned upright.p  pHowever, for a 3D space game where the player needs to be rotated on all axises, what is the best way to represent the rotationp  pI first tried using Euler anglesp  precodeglRotatefanglex, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f glRotatefangley, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f glRotatefanglez, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f codepre  pThe problem I had with this approach is that after each rotation, the axises change.

I want anglez to always rotate around the wings, irrelevant of anglex and angley.p  pI read that quaternions can be used to exhibit this desired behavior however was unable to achieve it in practice.p  pI assume my issue is due to the fact that I am basically still using Euler angles, but am converting the rotation to its quaternion representation before usage.p  precodestruct quaternion q  eulerToQuaternionanglex, angley, anglez struct matrix m  quaternionToMatrixq glMultMatrixampm codepre  pHowever, if storing each X, Y, and Z angle directly is incorrect, how do I say Rotate the ship around the wings or any consistent axis by 1 degree when my rotation is stored as a quaternionp  pAdditionally, I want to be able to translate the model at the angle that it is rotated by.

Negative 119 pIm creating a program that simulates that of the Breakout Game using C.p  pIve been learning various techniques on how to create the bricks, paddle and ball for the game but cannot work out on how to add them all into one picture box in Visual Studio. p  pThe main issue Im facing is that in order to move the ball for example, I have to clear the canvas by using the following section of code codepaper.ClearColor.Whitecode This basically clears the picture box to the colour white in order for the new coordinate of the ball for example to be dawn within the picture box and this is where my issue begins.p  pEach of the components within the Breakout game that I have practised all use the codepaper.ClearColor.Whitecode code. This means that if for example I want to move the paddle, display the bricks and bounce the ball simultaneously, the program just decides to do one function at a time. If I remove codepaper.ClearColor.Whitecode from one of my assets then the program just wont function in the way I want it to. p  pIs there a way for all these components to run simultaneously within the game without missing any of them out completely  p

Negative 119 pI have spent numerous hours researching and attempting to find a viable solution for creating system notifications on the Mac OSX Operating System. Out of all of the solutions here is what I have concluded p  ul lipa hrefhttpwww.swingfx.ch relnofollowTwinklea  It appears to be the most efficient tool when creating notifications however there is a significant lack of documentation, large amounts of outdated documentation links, and is confusing to use. pli lipa hrefhttpgrowl.info relnofollowGrowla  This is most likely the best solution for anybody else but requires a separate installation on the machine. Furthermore, it is a paid solution which for most pieces of software is not scalable nor distributable.pli lipApple Script  I find this the most intuitive and simplistic solution of the three with the pros of it being free and well documented. Consequently, several features lack in its function such as not being able to set the icon, or set what application the notification will refer to. Ex codedisplay notification Hello, worldcodepli ul  pWhile all solutions do make a notification on the Mac OSX machine, none of them can be packaged into the Jar, dont require a separate installation, are free and are up to date. Essentially if someone can create a tool that will make a MacOSX notification via some form of reflection to ObjectiveC that would be phenomenal.p
Negative 119 pI work on a project, where much of concurrent reading and writing to the DB is bringing performance down. Imagine that I need to sort of reindex the entire DB from time to time, so, the simplest way possible is to set a dirty flag to true, and let multiple machines grab at the dirty items, do some processing,  and then set their state to clean again. As you can imagine, this is a paradise for deadlocks.p  pI want to optimize this, and leave the DB IO operations to one coordinating machine,  and the rest of the possible concurrent computing to other machines. I thought that Akka, with its distributed actor model can be an ideal for for this. My idea is to have the coordinating actor read batches of dirty items from the DB, fire off numerous processing actors, passing an item to each one. The idea is that the processing actors will reside on different machines,  but neither the coordinator, nor the processors should be aware of this. This seems to be made possible by, and of the big advantages of using Akka.

Negative 119 pI have the habit of opening my Delphi projects from File Explorer by doubleclicking on the .dpr or .dproj file.p  pNormally, this will launch Embarcadero RAD Studio XE7 in my case and open the project for me.p  pId like to compare how something is done in a separate project different directory, etc.. If I doubleclick on a second .dpr.dproj file, the default action seems to be to add that to the Project Group of the instance of RAD Studio that I already have open.p  pIs there a way I can set up RAD Studio to open a second instance for me so that I can see things side by side p  pCurrently I manually open up a new instance and then find the project file through FileOpen, but that is painful.p

Negative 119 pI have a trackbar control that is adjusting the brightness of the background color of a form.  Eventually, Ill modify it to adjust an images brightness.  If you look at how the brightness slider works in the Microsoft colorDialog Control, as you move up and down, the value changes from white to black, but in the middle, the hue of the original color is never lost. Originally, I was losing the hue, and just doing a grayscale adjustment, but I finally found the work around for that.  p  pMy current problem is that I cannot adjust the entire color range.  For example, when selecting the color R 192, G 128, B 255, I can scroll all the way down to black, and all the way back up to my original color, but I cant scroll up to white.  Ive been working on this code a few hours a day for 10 days now, and either get from black to white and lose the hue that is resolved, or get the current issue I can scroll from lavendar to black to lavendar, but cant scroll up to white. Id deeply appreciate some assistance. Thank you.  p  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form      double xRed, xGreen, xBlue, xColor     bool count  true      private void Form1BackColorChangedobject sender, EventArgs e              Do this once, when user sets a new BG color          if count  true                                           Get a  of the color value instead of the absolute value,  when using absolute value, if it goes down near 0, or up near 255, hue is lost.               xRed  double this.BackColor.R  255              xGreen  double this.BackColor.G  255              xBlue  double this.BackColor.B  255              xColor  xRed  xGreen  xBlue  255   3              xColor  Math.RoundxColor, 0              Label is just so I can see RGB and trackBar values              lblBGColor.Enabled  true              trackBar1.Enabled  true              trackBar1.Value  intxColor              label1.Text  Convert.ToStringtrackBar1.Value             count  false                           private void trackBar1Scrollobject sender, EventArgs e              double bgRed  0, bgGreen  0, bgBlue  0         Once it goes down to black or up to white, restore the hue value as a percent.

My first thought was that it might be a problem with the version of Weld shipped with Glassfish but it turns out that GlassFish 4.1 is running Weld version 2.2.2 whereas WildFly is running Weld version 2.1.2.p  pIs there anything I can do in GlassFish, my code or in the MyBatis CDI module to overcome this problem when running in GlassFish Alternatively can anyone suggest anything that I can do to investigate the problem further pleasep

Negative 119 pIve got a project that I am working on that works fine when debugging from IntelliJ but when I do a release build still in IntelliJ and install the .air fil to my computer none of the FastInject tags seem to work.p  pI thought that this might be due to the includeas3metadata issue but that does not seem to be the case. I have included all the metadata tags that I think I have used.p  pI have spent some time investigating this and have not made much progress other than getting frustratedp  pI created a view that displays the logs created by spicefactory  but this seemed to fix the issue I tested to see if I could inject and of classes that are expected to be FastInjected, this also fixed the issue.p  pIt seems that if I add any logging related code to the application the FastInject tags start working.p  pIn fact, I have created a release air file a hrefhttpgiles.roadnight.nameflexFileImportercom.pricklythistle.fileimporter0.0.16.air relnofollowherea.

Any kind of data that fits a comprehensive statistics and search functionality.p  pA lot of these methods will be using an advanced for loop with an iterator.p  blockquote   pAs it stands now, the only way to link a Person to its insurances is   by comparing the uniquePersonId variables to each other.

Negative 119 pI am creating a vCard and among other things am including a note, like sop  precode[vCardArray addObject[NSString stringWithFormatNOTE, note]] codepre  pThen, as is standard procedure, creating a string from the array using n, like sop  precodeNSString string  [vCardArray componentsJoinedByStringn] codepre  pThe conflict arising is that my note string has a n in it, which messes up the vCard representation. I have tried using r both as the separator and within my note string, but to no avail.p  pIs there a way around this Id like to add a line of extra space in my note. Thanks in advancep

Negative 119 pI feel like this should be really easy to do, but I cant find anything about it on the web.

Negative 119 pI am trying to submit a form via PHP CURL library. The problem is there is a hidden input field in which its value changes after each refresh, it means that it changes when I send to different requests to read the page content. I need that hidden value to be sent among the other fields in my POST request for the form submission to be submitted successfully.Since the action of the form that I want to submit is itself the same page I do not know how to fetch the hidden input value, put it in the POST request and send the POST request which would be considered roughly simultaneous. I have used a specific library for my CURL so even if I share the code you will not completely understand it.Anyway, I think I have clearly explained what I am confused about. Looking forward to hearing from you.br bP.S.b You might say, it will not be simultaneous, one request to fetch the form and one another to send the POST request. Indeed, the problem is when I fetch the page content to get the hidden valueTOKEN it has value X and when I want to send the POST request after it, it will have value Y. I want to have X and utilize it in submitting the form with X going to take value Y. That is the simplest way to explain what I want. p

Negative 119 pI do all my accounting in Quickbooks Online and customers can pay invoices online.  However sometimes I need to accept a payment that isnt tied to one specific invoice.

However, I cannot find a way to login a user to all websites simultaneously, so that the user does not have to login again.p  pI would prefer to do this without modifying the DNN source too much. Since all three websites are on the same DNN installation, I was hoping there would be a way to share authentication cookies, but I havent found any yet.p  pCan anyone provide me more direction in this matter Thanksp

Negative 119 pI am using libSVM library for Support Vector Machines Classification. Kernel matrix iw precomputed. As such, the api expects kernel similarity between a test sample and all the training samples for the corresponding inference on the sample. Since the decision boundary is decided by support vectors only, I want to compute kernel of a test sample with only support vector samples. This should significantly reduce computational cost. However, I have no luck, so far, in finding such functionality in libSVM. Theoretically, it should be easy. But there is no implementation.p  pSpecifically, I use sklearn interface to libSVM. Python interface provided by libSVM, itself, also seems to have sample problem as one would expect.p  pPlease suggest if there is some functionality to just pass the kernel between a test sample and the support vector samples. If not, is there some api like SVM light that could be useful along these lines  Is there a theoretical reason for computing a full kernel matrix, i.e. kernel between a test sample and all training samples instead of the support vector samples.p  pOn an additional note, precomputed kernel matrix on my end is graph kernel. Though, it should not matter except for the fact that graph kernels are very expensive to compute motivating the need for the above mentioned api. Please note that, as such, graph kernels do not explicitly provide vectors. So, after learning SVM on training data, we know sample train graphs representing the support vectors but not the actual support vectors. I am assuming that it should not be a problem. p
