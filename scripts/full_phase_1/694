Positive 694 pSeveral years ago I built a system around Flex Builder 2 and ColdFusion 8. It uses MySQL 5.5 and Web Services The application ran very nicely for several years on a hosted server. Then I mothballed it for several years. I tried to revive it a few months ago only to find that the world had changed considerably. Adobe gave Flex to Apache and ColdFusion was up to version 11.p  pI know that I have to migrate to CF10 or CF11,but I wouldlike to use all of the MXML code that I had been using. I installed CF11 and found that all of the data from MySQL was displaying in Flex 2 as nulls. I did some instrumentation on the CF code and found that the query return data, while still on the server looked correct however when viewed on the client all of the data was displaying as nulls.   p  pI hope that someone has also experienced this and can help me with a solution.p  pThank you, Lionel Bentkowerp

My desired output from a SQL query is this, if looking for id 1p  precodeorderid    purchasecategory    paymentmethod    type      product  123         Sandwich           creditcard    Burger   NULL codepre  pAnd if looking for id 2p  precodeorderid    purchasecategory    paymentmethod    type      product  456         Item               debitcard      NULL       Stickers codepre  pAnd if looking for id 3p  precodeorderid    purchasecategory    paymentmethod    type      product  789         Dessert            NULL             Cake     NULL codepre  pAnd if looking for id 4p  precodeorderid    purchasecategory    paymentmethod    type      product  NULL        Item               NULL              NULL      Game codepre  pNotice how in the tables, an ID may not exist in the table, but I still want to return the desired fields as NULL if the ID does not exist in the table.  I have researched extensively to try to find the solution and I cant seem to get it.  Here is the code I have written so farp  precodeSELECT customer.orderid, customer.purchasecategory, order.paymentmethod, food.type, item.product FROM customer, food, item LEFT JOIN order ON customer.orderidorder.orderid WHERE customer.id1 and food.id1 and item.id1  codepre  pHowever when an id does not exist in one of the tables, the whole thing returns the empty set.  I just need the desired fields to populate with NULL in this case.  I also need to protect against when an orderid is NULL in the customer table, e.g. output when looking for id 4.p

Positive 694 pI have the edit view and the edit action in my blog controller. After I created a post with the create action and after I upload the image to the database folder, I update the path on the post.PostImage string value. I can see the image in the folder, and I can see the path of my image and I can also see the preview of the picture in the edit view. In my database it saved as ImagesPostIDPictureName. But after I edit my post, I want to make a checkbox that if checked I can edit the picture and when is it not checked I delete the picture. I send the parameters, and my problem is that on the debugger I see the string postimage as null but on the database table it has the path and because of that all of this doesnt work, I dont care about logic, why is it null  here is my codep  pVIEWp  precodemodel WebApplication1.Models.Post       ViewBag.Title  Edit     Layout  ViewsSharedLayout.cshtml   lth2gtEditlth2gt   using Html.BeginFormHtml.BeginFormEdit, Blog, FormMethod.Post, new  enctype  multipartformdata       Html.AntiForgeryToken      ltdiv classformhorizontalgt         lth4gtPostlth4gt         lthr gt         Html.ValidationSummarytrue, , new  class  textdanger          Html.HiddenFormodel gt model.PostID          ltdiv classformgroupgt             Html.LabelFormodel gt model.PostTitle, htmlAttributes new  class  controllabel colmd2              ltdiv classcolmd10gt                 Html.EditorFormodel gt model.PostTitle, new  htmlAttributes  new  class  formcontrol                   Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.PostTitle, , new  class  textdanger              ltdivgt         ltdivgt          ltdiv classformgroupgt             Html.LabelFormodel gt model.PostAuthor, htmlAttributes new  class  controllabel colmd2              ltdiv classcolmd10gt                 Html.EditorFormodel gt model.PostAuthor, new  htmlAttributes  new  class  formcontrol                   Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.PostAuthor, , new  class  textdanger              ltdivgt         ltdivgt          ltdiv classformgroupgt             Html.LabelFormodel gt model.WebSite, htmlAttributes new  class  controllabel colmd2              ltdiv classcolmd10gt                 Html.EditorFormodel gt model.WebSite, new  htmlAttributes  new  class  formcontrol                   Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.WebSite, , new  class  textdanger              ltdivgt         ltdivgt          ltdiv classformgroupgt             Html.LabelFormodel gt model.PostDate, htmlAttributes new  class  controllabel colmd2              ltdiv classcolmd10gt                 Html.EditorFormodel gt model.PostDate, new  htmlAttributes  new  class  formcontrol                   Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.PostDate, , new  class  textdanger              ltdivgt         ltdivgt          ltdiv classformgroupgt             Html.LabelFormodel gt model.PostText, htmlAttributes new  class  controllabel colmd2              ltdiv classcolmd10gt                 Html.EditorFormodel gt model.PostText, new  htmlAttributes  new  class  formcontrol                   Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.PostText, , new  class  textdanger              ltdivgt         ltdivgt          ltdiv classformgroupgt               ltdivgt                 ltbgtUpload imageltbgt                 if Model.PostImage.IsEmpty                                                              Html.CheckBoxcheckImage, true                         ltimg srcUrl.ContentModel.PostImage altModel.PostAuthor width300 gt                                   else                                      Html.CheckBoxcheckImage, false                              ltdivgt                         ltinput typefile namefile idfile gt             lt Show message of the controller gt             ViewBag.Message         ltdivgt              ltdiv classformgroupgt             Html.LabelFormodel gt model.PostVideo, htmlAttributes new  class  controllabel colmd2              ltdiv classcolmd10gt                 Html.EditorFormodel gt model.PostVideo, new  htmlAttributes  new  class  formcontrol                   Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.PostVideo, , new  class  textdanger              ltdivgt         ltdivgt          ltdiv classformgroupgt             ltdiv classcolmdoffset2 colmd10gt                 ltinput typesubmit valueSave classbtn btndefault gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt     Html.ActionLinkBack to Posts List, Index ltdivgt  section Scripts      Scripts.Renderbundlesjqueryval  codepre  pEDIT ACTION IN BLOG CONTROLLERp  precode    GET BlogEdit5         public ActionResult Editint id                      if id  null                              return new HttpStatusCodeResultHttpStatusCode.BadRequest                          Post post  db.Posts.Findid             if post  null                              return HttpNotFound                          return Viewpost                    POST BlogEdit5          To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for           more details see httpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId317598.

Positive 694 pIm looking for a clean and simple way to read a nullterminated C string from a file or filelike object in Python. In a way that doesnt consume more input from the file than it needs, or pushes it back onto whatever filebuffer it works with such that other code can read the data immediately after a nullterminated string.p  pIve seen a hrefhttpbytes.comtopicpythonanswers41987canonicalwaydealingnullseparatedlines relnofollowa bit of rather ugly codea to do it, but not much that Id like to use.p  pa hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryfunctions.htmlopen relnofollowuniversal newlines supporta only works for codeopencodeed files, not StringIO objects etc, and doesnt look like it handles unconventional newlines. Also, if it did work itd result in strings with codencode appended, which is undesirable.p  pa hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2librarystruct.html relnofollowstructa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq26060110398670doesnt look like it supports reading arbitrarylength C strings at alla, requiring a length as part of the format.p  pa hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryctypes.html relnofollowctypesa has codecbuffercode, which can be constructed from a byte string and will return the first null terminated string as its codevaluecode. Again, this requires determining how much must be read in advance, and it doesnt differentiate between nullterminated and unterminated strings. The same is true of codeccharpcode. So it doesnt seem to help much, since you already have to know youve read enough of the string and have to handle buffer splits.p  pThe usual way to do this in C is read chunks into a buffer, copying and resizing the buffer if needed, then check if the newest chunk read contains a null byte. If it does, return everything up to the null byte and either realign the buffer or if youre being fancy, keep on reading and use it as a ring buffer. This only works if you can hand the excess data read back to the caller, or if your platforms codeungetccode lets to push a lot back onto the file, of course.p  pIs it necessary to spell out similar code in Python I was surprised not to find anything canned in codeiocode, codectypescode or codestructcode.p  pfile objects dont seem to have a way to push back onto their buffer, like codeungetccode, and neither do buffered IO streams in the codeiocode module.p  pI feel like I must be missing the obvious here. Id really rather avoid bytebybyte readingp  precodedef readcstrf     buf  bytearray     while True         b  f.read1         if b is None or b  0             return strbuf         else             buf.appendb codepre  pbut right now thats what Im doing.p

CtrlF1   This inspection analyzes method control and data flow to report possible conditions that are always true or false, expressions whose value is statically proven to be constant, and situations that can lead to nullability contract violations.  Variables, method parameters and return values marked as Nullable or NotNull are treated as nullable or notnull, respectively and used during the analysis to check nullability contracts, e.g. report possible NullPointerException errors. More complex contracts can be defined using Contract annotation, for example Contract, null gt null  method returns null if its second argument is null Contract, null gt null , null gt null  method returns null if its second argument is null and notnull otherwise Contracttrue gt fail  a typical assertFalse method which throws an exception if true is passed to it  The inspection can be configured to use custom Nullable NotNull annotations by default the ones from annotations.jar will be used codepre  pstrongEDIT 2strong As it turns out, the code analysis is wrong, the value is nonnull once run. Thank you everyone including commentators for sharing your insights and advice. Ultimately I inserted a logger.info with the value before the condition and everything seemed to work.

I also need to install files in the current users Application Data directory. The problem is that when the user is not an admin on Vista I need to elevate privileges and in doing so the environment variables change so the current user now appears to be the admin user and I end up installing in the Admin users directory instead of the actual user. You have to elevate when you start the installer so I cant grab the username and then elevate.

The app wont work without the thing Im writing to the users directory because its a MS Word template.

Negative 694 pFirst things first, I am a Python beginner, with a typical CJava background for object oriented stuff.p  pI was convinced to try Python for this current endeavor I am working on, and so far I like it. One issue I am having though is finding a good mp3 module.p  pI have tried TkSnack, which installed and ran fine with no errorsas long as my audio device wasnt busy but it could never actually produce a sound, it just did nothing... I went online for help, and was disappointed with the amount of documentation. p  pSo I decided to switch. I tried PyMad because it is in the standard repositories for Ubuntu as well. There was even less documentation on this, but I could make it play a sound. The only problem is that it requires a loop to constantly writeplay the audio buffer. This makes it particularly hairy to handle playback controlin my opinion cause I would have to run this in a separate thread or process, and somehow control the seek position for pause and such. This is a little too low level for why I am using Python. I liked the simplicity of TkSnack for its easy commands like mysound.play or mysound.pause rather than controlling a loop.p  pI also looked at pyMedia, which looks like it is the most up to date with documentation, but I cant get it to install on my machine. I get a gcc exited with value 1 error or something like that when running the python setup.py build command. p  pSo I am looking for any suggestions or help on one of these modules, or a completely different one, that is high level and easy to use for mp3sand preferably other formats too I am trying to have basic playback controlpause, stop, skip, seek and I may also be streaming files too eventuallyif I ever get there. p  pstrongEDITstrong I like the python bindings for Gstreamer, but is this a crossplatform solution I forgot to mention that as a requirement.

Negative 694 pI have an NSTableView that binds to an NSArrayController, which in turn binds to an object property that returns an NSMutableArray.p  pThis array is listening for events in a separate part of the application and updates itself internally. The model object that owns an instance of the array does not make any changes to the array.p  pI know that the ArrayController is not able to respond to changes made to the Array directly. I undersand that the ArrayController is observing the model object for changes to the array. Since the model object in my case is not modifying the array  I would like to fake the notification calls that the ArrayController is listening for. But there is no documentation of these notifications, or what key value changes the ArrayController is listening for.p  pDoes anyone know what notifications need to be sent so that the ArrayController updates itself  Alternatively  are the debug flags or some other debugging trick I can use to identify what Key values the ArrayCotnroller is observing p  pThanks,p  phr p  pUpdate I have since found the solution to this issue. Adding a level of indirection between the underlying objects and the observed collection object, and implementing the KVO methods for indexed mutable accessors did the trick.p

But I am very open to hearing about other ideas on frameworks to use, or other options I have to use Haskell in some way.p
Negative 694 pI have a web application that communicates to a WCF service through a WCF client. At the point my code is invoked, authentication cookies have been issued and I have a dependency on an ASMX service that expects those authentication cookies.p  pI need to pass the cookies from the web application through the WCF client to the WCF service to the ASMX service.p  pAny ideas It looks like my best bet may be setting allowCookies to false, parsing out the cookie headers, attempting to recreate them on the WCF service and then attaching them to the SOAP request. p  pNote I looked at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions201153wcfclientconsumingmultipleasmxservicethatuseshttpcookiesthis articlea, which seems close but not quite applicable to this question. In the linked scenario, an ASMX service is creating cookies, which must be persisted to a subsequent ASMX service by the same WCF client.p

Negative 694 pIm writing an application that keep track of a library of music, and I need a way to store the list of tracks, albums and other data. Usually for something like this I would use an XML file to save the data. And then I would use an ADO.NET DataTable to manipulate the data. But this program could potentially be saving a large number of data items. Also Im going to want to be able to quickly search, sort, and filter the table of songs.p  pSo my first question is there a best practices limit on how much data should be stored in a single XML file before its a better idea to be using a relational database Second what are some alternative options for how I store this data in a single file. Keep in mind I dont want the program to rely on there being a server MS SQL, MySQL etc. running somewhere that it can connect to. I want the data stored in a single file. Also Im not a huge fan of MS Access. So while there are ways for ADO.NET to access an MDB file Im looking for other options.p  pAnother option Im considering is sticking with serializingserializing my collection of Track objects tofrom XMl. Yet doing any database type stuff like searching, sorting, filtering using Linq on the collection. I havent used Linq yet, so Im not sure of the specifics for how this would be done, or if it would be the best option.p

Negative 694 pPlease help me to backup my database from sqlexpress. p
Negative 694 pI have a web application that accesses a database through a wcf service.  The idea is to abstract the data from the web application using the wcf service.  All that works fine but I am also using the built in roleprovider using the SqlRoleManager which does access the aspnetdb database directly.  I would like to abstract the roleprovider by creating a custom roleprovider in a wcf service and then accessing it through the wcf service.p  pI have created the custom role provider and it works fine but now I need to place it in a wcf service.  p  pSo before I jump headlong into trying to get this to work through the WCF service, I created a second class in the web application that accessed the roleprovider class and changed my web config roleprovider parameters to use that class.  So my roleprovider class is called, UcfCstRoleProvider and my web.config looks like thisp  precode    ltroleManager      enabledtrue      defaultProviderUcfCstRoleProvidergt   ltprovidersgt     ltadd          nameUcfCstRoleProvider          typeUcf.Security.Wcf.WebTests.UcfCstRoleProvider, Ucf.Security.Wcf.WebTests          connectionStringNameSqlRoleManagerConnection          applicationNameSMTP gt   ltprovidersgt ltroleManagergt codepre  pMy class starts like thisp  precode    public class UcfCstRoleProvider  RoleProvider      private readonly WindowsTokenRoleProvider roleProxy  new WindowsTokenRoleProvider      public override string ApplicationName              get                      return roleProxy.ApplicationName                  set                      roleProxy.ApplicationName  value               codepre  pAs I said, this works fine.  So the second class is called BlRoleProvider that has identical properties and parameters as the roleprovide but does not implement RoleProvider.  I changed the web.config to point to this class like thisp  precode    ltroleManager      enabledtrue      defaultProviderBlRoleProvidergt   ltprovidersgt     ltadd          nameUcfCstRoleProvider          typeUcf.Security.Wcf.WebTests.BlRoleProvider, Ucf.Security.Wcf.WebTests          connectionStringNameSqlRoleManagerConnection          applicationNameSMTP gt   ltprovidersgt ltroleManagergt codepre  pBut I get this error. Provider must implement the class System.Web.Security.RoleProvider.p  pI hope I have explained well enough to show what I am trying to do.  If I can get the roleprovider to work through another class in the same application, I am sure it will work through the WCF service but how do I get past this errorp  pOr maybe I took a wrong turn and there is a better way to do what I want to dop

Negative 694 pIm currently working on some concurrent code that would appear to have a few race conditions in it. Im attempting to debug the code using my current IDE, Eclipse, but Im not completely satisfied. In particular, a race condition is present for a variable such that without a break point on one of the methods accessing it the one getting it, the variable setting method does not complete, and the variable is set to null. However, if I put a break point on the accessing method, and hold F8the default step over buttonthe variable is almost always set to the correct nonnull value.p  pThis leads me to ask the following is it possible that Eclipse doesnt pause execution on the breakpoint across all threads quickly enough that I can look at the potential race condition as it appears without a break point, or is something else probably happeningp  pIf it is the case that Eclipse doesnt pause execution quickly, are there other IDEsdebuggers for Java that may do a better job of this Note that Im not looking for formal verification tools like Java PathfinderI dont want to check if race conditions are present, I want to see them unfold in my debugger if only because it might be interesting to watch.p

Negative 694 h2Question summary How do I modify the code below so that untrusted, dynamicallyloaded code runs in a security sandbox while the rest of the application remains unrestricted Why doesnt URLClassLoader just handle it like it says it doesh2  pstrongEDIT Updated to respond to Ani B.strongp  pstrongEDIT 2 Added updated PluginSecurityManager.strongp  pMy application has a plugin mechanism where a third party can provide a JAR containing a class which implements a particular interface. Using URLClassLoader, I am able to load that class and instantiate it, no problem. Because the code is potentially untrusted, I need to prevent it from misbehaving. For example, I run plugin code in a separate thread so that I can kill it if it goes into an infinite loop or just takes too long. But trying to set a security sandbox for them so that they cant do things like make network connections or access files on the hard drive is making me positively batty. My efforts always result in either having no effect on the plugin it has the same permissions as the application or also restricting the application. I want the main application code to be able to do pretty much anything it wants, but the plugin code to be locked down.p  pDocumentation and online resources on the subject are complex, confusing and contradictory. Ive read in various places such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions502218sandboxagainstmaliciouscodeinajavaapplicationthis questiona that I need to provide a custom SecurityManager, but when I try it I run into problems because the JVM lazyloads the classes in the JAR. So I can instantiate it just fine, but if I call a method on the loaded object which instantiates another class from the same JAR, it blows up because its denied the right to read from the JAR.p  pTheoretically, I could put a check on FilePermission in my SecurityManager to see if its trying to load out of its own JAR. Thats fine, but a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapithe URLClassLoader documentationa says The classes that are loaded are by default granted permission only to access the URLs specified when the URLClassLoader was created. So why do I even need a custom SecurityManager Shouldnt URLClassLoader just handle this Why doesnt itp  pHeres a simplified example that reproduces the problemp  h2Main application trustedh2  h3PluginTest.javah3  precodepackage test.app  import java.io.File import java.net.URL import java.net.URLClassLoader  import test.api.Plugin  public class PluginTest      public static void pluginTestString pathToJar          try              File file  new FilepathToJar             URL url  file.toURI.toURL             URLClassLoader cl  new URLClassLoadernew java.net.URL[]  url              Classltgt clazz  cl.loadClasstest.plugin.MyPlugin             final Plugin plugin  Plugin clazz.newInstance             PluginThread thread  new PluginThreadnew Runnable                  Override                 public void run                      plugin.go                                           thread.start          catch Exception ex              ex.printStackTrace                codepre  h3Plugin.javah3  precodepackage test.api  public interface Plugin      public void go  codepre  h3PluginSecurityManager.javah3  precodepackage test.app  public class PluginSecurityManager extends SecurityManager      private boolean sandboxed      Override     public void checkPermissionPermission perm          checkperm            Override     public void checkPermissionPermission perm, Object context          checkperm           private void checkPermission perm          if sandboxed              return                    I could check FilePermission here, but why doesnt          URLClassLoader handle it like it says it does          throw new SecurityExceptionPermission denied           void enableSandbox      sandboxed  true           void disableSandbox          sandboxed  false       codepre  h3PluginThread.javah3  precodepackage test.app  class PluginThread extends Thread      PluginThreadRunnable target          supertarget           Override     public void run          SecurityManager old  System.getSecurityManager         PluginSecurityManager psm  new PluginSecurityManager         System.setSecurityManagerpsm         psm.enableSandbox         super.run         psm.disableSandbox         System.setSecurityManagerold       codepre  h2Plugin JAR untrustedh2  h3MyPlugin.javah3  precodepackage test.plugin  public MyPlugin implements Plugin      Override     public void go          new AnotherClassInTheSamePlugin  ClassNotFoundException with a SecurityManager         doSomethingDangerous  permitted without a SecurityManager           private void doSomethingDangerous           use your imagination       codepre  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong I changed it so that just before the plugin code is about to run, it notifies the PluginSecurityManager so that it will know what class source its working with. Then it will only allow file accesses on files under that class source path. This also has the nice advantage that I can just set the security manager once at the beginning of my application, and just update it when I enter and leave plugin code.p  pThis pretty much solves the problem, but doesnt answer my other question Why doesnt URLClassLoader handle this for me like it says it does Ill leave this question open for a while longer to see if anyone has an answer to that question. If so, that person will get the accepted answer. Otherwise, Ill award it to Ani B. on the presumption that the URLClassLoader documentation lies and that his advice to make a custom SecurityManager is correct.p  pThe PluginThread will have to set the classSource property on the PluginSecurityManager, which is the path to the class files. PluginSecurityManager now looks something like thisp  precodepackage test.app  public class PluginSecurityManager extends SecurityManager      private String classSource      Override     public void checkPermissionPermission perm          checkperm            Override     public void checkPermissionPermission perm, Object context          checkperm           private void checkPermission perm          if classSource  null               Not running plugin code             return                   if perm instanceof FilePermission               Is the request inside the class source             String path  perm.getName             boolean inClassSource  path.startsWithclassSource               Is the request for readonly access             boolean readOnly  read.equalsperm.getActions              if inClassSource ampamp readOnly                  return                                throw new SecurityExceptionPermission denied   perm           void setClassSourceString classSource      classSource  classSource       codepre

Negative 694 pI would like to have a method which can invoke a method that is passed to it. The idea is to retry if there is a dead lock exception, and instead of adding a codetrycode codecatchcode to every place I want this, I would rather have a utility that works like coderetryExecutionMethod methodcode. Inside the coderetryExecutioncode method is all the reusable logic to handle retrying deadlocks.

The notify icon in the system tray is a Forms notify icon I dont know of a native WPF notify icon.  Therefore, the notifyicon.ContextMenu property is not used.  The code above works fine.  When the user right clicks on the notify icon, the context menu shows as it should.p  pThe issue Im having is with making the ContextMenu go away when I want.  It goes away fine as long as you click somewhere within the WPF app.  This behavior is automatic.  But if the user clicks elsewhere, such as the taskbar, the menu doesnt disappear.  LostFocus events dont fire because these types of events only fire when an element loses focus to another element within the same app.  As far as the app is concerned, the ContextMenu never loses focus.  Deactivated was another event I tried to use.  I should clarify at this point that the application has a close to tray option, so the application could close and fire the deactivated event before the user has a chance to right click and show the menu.  The app is not reactivated when the menu appears, so the deactivated even wont fire when I click on the taskbar.p  pSo finally, the question.  How do I get my context menu to disappear when the user clicks away from it, even if the place where the user clicks isnt in the application that created the context menup

Negative 694 pAlright actually Ive study about how to use looping to make my code more efficient so that I could use a particular block of code that should be repeated without typing it over and over again, and after attempted to use what Ive learn so far to program something, I feel its time for me to proceed to the next chapter to learn on how to use control statement to learn how to instructs the program to make decision.p  pBut the thing is that, before I advance myself to it, I still have a few question that need any experts help on previous stuff. Actually its about datatype.p  hr  pstrongA. Character Typestrongp  ol liI extract the following from the book C primer Plus 5th edli ol  blockquote   pSomewhat oddly , C treats character   constans as type codeintcode rather than   codecharcode. For example, on an ASCII system   with a 32bit codeintcode and an 8bit codecharcode   , the codep  precodechar grade  B codepre      prepresents codeBcode as the numerical value   66 stored in a 32bit unit, codegradecode   winds up with 66 stored ub ab 8bit   unit. This characteristic of character   constants makes it possible to define   a character constant such as codeFATEcode,   with four separate 8bit ASCII codes   stored in a 32bit unit. However ,   attempting to assign such a character   constant to a codecharcode variable results   in only the last 8 bits being used,   so the variable gets the value codeEcode.p blockquote  ol lipSo the next thing I did after reading this was of course, follow what it mentions, that is I try store the word codeFATEcode on a variable with codechar gradecode and try to compile and see what itll be stored using codeprintfcode, but instead of getting the character codeEcode printed out, what I get is codeFcode.pli lipDoes this mean theres some mistake in the book OR is there something I misunderstoodpli lipFrom the above sentences, theres a line says C treats character constants as type codeintcode. So to try it out, I assign a number bigger than code255code, e.x. code356code to the codecharcode type.pli lipSince code356code is within the range of 32bit codeintcode Im running Windows 7, therefore I expect it would print out code356code when I use the codedcode specifier.pli lipBut instead of printing code356code, it gives me code100code, which is the last 8bits value.pli lipWhy does this happen I thought codechar  int  32bitscode emAlthough it does mention before char is only a byteem.pli ol  hr  pstrongB. Int and Floating Typestrongp  ol lipI understand when a number stores in variable in codeshortcode type is pass to variadic function or any implicit prototype function, itll be automatically promoted to codeintcode type.pli lipThis also happen to floating point type, when a floatingpoint number with codefloatcode type is passed, itll be converted to codedoublecode type, that is why theres no specifier for the codefloatcode type but instead theres only codefcode for codedoublecode and codeLfcode for codelong doublecode.pli lipBut why theres a specifier for codeshortcode type although it is also promoted but not codefloatcode type Why dont they just give a specifier for codefloatcode type with a modifier like codehfcode or something Is there anything logical or technical behind thispli ol

Messages are typically short less than a few hundred bytes, but could potentially be 100KB or more in size.pli lipMessages do not need to be acknowledged i.e., not a requestresponse model like HTTP. For example, the C program sends a message to the Java program, and the Java program may reply by sending a message to the C program at a later time  and vice versa.pli lipAn ideal solution would have a very low latency, b no security hassles user does not have to authorize ports to be opened etc. and c will be platformagnostic.pli ol  pMy first thought was using strongsocketsstrong  each program would act as a server to the other.

Instead of living in its own folder off of the domain, the fullFlash site will be a progressively enhanced version of the HTML site, so if a user supports Flash, all HTML content will be replaced by Flash content.p  pOnce the new site is launched, each pageURL in the Flash site will have a corresponding HTML pageURL for example, the Flash content at a hrefhttpwww.domain.comaboutclients relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comaboutclientsa corresponds to the HTML content at a hrefhttpwww.domain.comaboutclients relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comaboutclientsa.p  pWere going to implement a 301 redirect so the old flash path points to the domain itself, but were not sure how to proceed in terms of redirects between the HTML and Flash versions of the site.  One possibility would be to simply do clientside detection of capabilities and redirect the user to the appropriate version under that scenario, a nonFlashcapable client that attempts to visit a hrefhttpwww.domain.comaboutclients relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comaboutclientsa would be JSredirected to a hrefhttpwww.domain.comaboutclients relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comaboutclientsa, and a Flashcapable client visiting a hrefhttpwww.domain.comaboutclients relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comaboutclientsa would be JSredirected to a hrefhttpwww.domain.comaboutclients relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comaboutclientsa.  p  pIs this a reasonable approach  Are there any potential SEO red flags that we should be aware of before proceedingp  pThanks for your considerationp

Negative 694 pI am writing an iPhone app that uses Facebook extensively.  Right now, Im getting the access token using the iPhone Facebook SDK.  This returns me a standard access token.  p  pIm sending this token serverside and using it for many queries successfully.  However, there are some queries that require an access token signed with the Application Secret, which the iPhone app sdk cant do clientside due to security vulnerabilities specifically Im trying to use dashboard methods.  p  pSo my question is is there some way I can have Facebook upgrade this iPhone access token serverside to contain the signed secret  Or do I have to validate serverside from the beginning to do this  p  pThe docs say that with the Serverside flow method, once the user allows your app, you get a code generated by the server that you must send back with your App Secret to get your access token.  The iPhone SDK uses Clientside flow method, and it seems to skip this step, so Im not sure how to get this code.  So I guess the question boils down to, is it possible to upgrade a token gotten with the client side flow method to one that can be used fully server side.p

Negative 694 pI am using Wicket with a custom PageAuthorizationStrategy which accesses the database for information on the current user and thereby his access permissions. Every request is wrapped by the Spring OpenSessionInView filter to openclose the Hibernate session. p  pThis works perfectly for reading access to the database. Whenever writing operations need to take place though, I call the service layer which uses Springs annotationbased transaction handling. This also works BUT I think it is the cause for a particular bug When an object is loaded during authentication in request A, then modified in another request B and then handed over to the service layer in request A, the service layer is working with wrong values since neither Hibernate nor the underlying database can ensure isolation. Since Im always struggling a bit with specifics of databasetransaction theory, please correct me if this assumption is already wrong.p  pMy first idea for a solution was to refresh the objects loaded for authentication right after a writing transaction had been started. This causes issues though when an object to be modified by the service is at the same time needed for authentication. This especially happens when Wicket populates an object with changed data from a form and it is passed to the service in a submit method for example.p  pSo probably, the correct way of doing this would be to ensure that the authentication code is already wrapped in the same transaction as any writing code that might be executed during the same request. p  pHow would I go about this the right way in Wicket p  pEDIT This problem just became even more of an issue as I realized that when the transactioned service method rolls back after an exception is thrown, the view layer causes a LazyInitializationException. Obviously, Springs TransactionManager clears the session andor something else in the depths of HibernateSpring goes wrong as I can reload an object from the database but trying to load a collection contained in that object causes said exception. Any ideas how to go about this I suppose it would all be solved if there was an elegant way to use onetransactionperrequest.p

Negative 694 pI have an application that Ive written for Windows which I am porting to Linux Ubuntu to be specific. The problem is that I have always just used Linux, never really developed for it. More specifically, I dont understand the fundamental layout of the system. For example, where should I install my software I want it to be accessible to all users, but I need write permission to the area to edit my data files. Furthermore, how can I determine in a programmatic way, where the software was installed not simply where its being called from In windows, I use the registry to locate my configuration file which has all of the relevant information, but there is no registry in Linux.

If theres a problem then roll back everything that happened and if everything was good then commit it. Its all worked quite great but theres just one flaw that Ive come across so far.  I added Exception logging so I can see when there are issues that users face. But the problem is, if the table that logs the errors is InnoDB then its also included in the transaction and will rollback if theres a problem so no errors are stored.  To get around this I basically just made the Error logging table MyISAM so when a rollback is done, the changes are still there.p  pNow Im thinking of other bits Id like to keep out of the transaction, like sending a mail within my application to the admin to help alert of problems.p  pIs there any sort of way for me to not include a database insert within the parent transaction Have I taken a bad route in terms of ApplicationDB design and is there any other way I could have handled thisp  pThanks, Dominicp

Negative 694 pI have a clientserver architecture written in .NET where there are hundreds of clients sending data to one server. Each item has an id and it is possible for different clients to send the same id multiple times.p  pThe ids are longs and the server needs to know if it has already recieved something with the same id. Every day the server will receive about 10,000,000 ids with  1,000,000 duplicates. Everytime it receives an id it will need to make some sort of lookup to see whether it has already been dealt with. It is extremely unlikely to get a duplicate id after a few days.p  pMy current ideas for solutions arep  ul lipIn memory dictionary of ids with a background thread to remove any items after they have been in the dictionary for over 3 days.pli lipMySql database with one indexed column for ids and a column for insertion date.pli ul  pThe issues I forsee are what sort of speed will a query be to the MySql database because I have to do  10,000,000 queries a day.

Negative 694 pIm working on a school assignment about Java reflection. The details are belowp  blockquote   pWrite a console program that asks the user for a class name, loads   that class and creates an instance of it. We assume that the class has   a constructor without any parameters. Then, the program prints out the   names and values of the public variables of the created object, and   also a list of the public methods that do not specify a parameter. The   program should let the user choose a method and execute that method on   the created object. Afterwards, the program should again show the   public variables with their values and allow the user to choose a   method, and so on. Use the following class to test your   implementationp  precodepublic class Counter      public int c     public void increment  c      public void decrement  c      public void reset  c  0   codepre blockquote  pThe problem I am having has to do with the following sentence list of the public methods that do not specify a parameter.

Negative 694 pWe have a library with a bunch of TextFields inside MovieClips.

My thought was that when adding an object to a Collection it just adds a pointer to the existing object which given this case the change notifications would be getting triggered on objects in the new list but this is not happening.

Negative 694 pI maintain a site with a bunch of downloadable files. It is currently hosted on a server in the U.S., but I have recently acquired a new server in Germany. I would like to mirror the downloads to the server in Germany, and have a PHP script on the first server hosting the website detect which file mirror to use based on the users location. For instance, if the user is in Canada, they should download the file from my current server in the U.S. If theyre in France, they should get the file from Germany, rather than downloading across the Atlantic. How, then, can I determine which country they are closer top  pI know about MaxMind GeoIP, and have it installed, but that just gives me a country, and AFAIK, there is no way to automatically determine which of my two mirror countries the given country is closest to. I suppose what I could do is go by continent have users in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Australia get the content from Germany, and have visitors from North and South America get the file from the U.S. If anyone can think of a better solution, Im open to suggestions.p  hr  pWell, I guess I am going to go go with my original idea of checking by continents. For others looking to do this sort of thing, that will be a good place to start. The problem will come when I have multiple mirrors in Europe, but the continent idea will have to work for now.p

If I have it sleep, it runs terribly slowly, seemingly on one core and works fine.p  pAdditionally, I do not know how to have it wait until both threads are done to actually output to file other than the sleep.time part, which completely defeats the purpose of speedp  pEXAMPLEp  precodehfreq [INSERT TEXT FILE ARRAYS HERE, RESPECTIVELY filenames0[] and filenames1[]] def count     some code here that writes frequency to hfreq def count1     some code here that writes frequency to hfreq as well, but using filenames1 t1Threadtargetcount,args t2Threadtargetcount1,args t1.start t2.start time.sleep15 No other known way to prevent the following from running immediately listhfreq.items list.sort OutputOpenFreq.txt, w [for statement that writes to file] Output.close codepre  pAnd that is where it ends.  If I run the program with no threading classes on its own, it gives about 1014 seconds of runtime.  If I try the threading approach halving the nonthreading array between the two threads, I get BOTH THREADS running for 14 seconds instead of the expected multicore usage. Thank you for reading this wall of text.  Please tell me if I can clarify.p
Negative 694 pHere is a picture of the resulting screenp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIM1rF.png altAndroid Screenp  pWhat I am doing is creating a surface view in FastRenderView.java and then posting to it from a bitmap I created in LoadingScreen.java.

Negative 694 pAccording to the official Python documentation for the weakref module the primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding large objects,.... So, I used a WeakValueDictionary to implement a caching mechanism for a long running function. However, as it turned out, values in the cache never stayed there until they would actually be used again, but needed to be recomputed almost every time. Since there were no strong references between accesses to the values stored in the WeakValueDictionary, the GC got rid of them even though there was absolutely no problem with memory. p  pNow, how am I then supposed to use the weak reference stuff to implement a cache If I keep strong references somewhere explicitly to keep the GC from deleting my weak references, there would be no point using a WeakValueDictionary in the first place. There should probably be some option to the GC that tells it delete everything that has no references at all and everything with weak references only when memory is running out or some threshold is exceeded. Is there something like that Or is there a better strategy for this kind of cachep

Negative 694 pI was wondering about this at a technical level. I was given to understand that iOS apps could only be built on Mac OS X because you needed the toolchain that is bundled with Mac OS X and XCode. p  pSo does anyone know how Senchas app builder can build a native app on Windows too And how come no one else has done it beforep
Negative 694 pI am using a hrefhttpdev.sencha.comdeployext4.0.7gplexamplesportalportal.html relnofollowhttpdev.sencha.comdeployext4.0.7gplexamplesportalportal.htmla to build a portal.

Negative 694 pWe have an app built in Delphi 7 using Indy 9 for https connections to a php back end running on PHP, on Linux.  The app connects to our current production server without a problem.  We have been building a test environment for this application in house, and on the test web server, it refuses to connect using https.  The app HAS been able to connect to this server using http.  I can connect any current browser using the same web calls the app makes havent tried older browsers, and I get the connection, and the data returs perfectly, so apparently a theres something in Indy 9 holding this up from working which is why this question is here and not on ServerFault  Does anyone have enough experience with Indy  SSL to know whats happening herep  pHere are the few differences I thought might have some input 1. I was initially starting with a wildcard cert.  It is valid, and on the correct domain.  It works with everything else we have on lots of servers. 2. Thinking it was possible that wildcard certs are a newer thing than Indy 9, I removed the wildcard cert, and put in a self signed cert, with the full machine name.  It failed in the same way.  BUT, as you know, browsers issue a cert exception with these self signed certs, so I was unsure if this would ALSO give Indy problems. 3. Im sure the version of OpenSSH on our new development server is newer than the one that is currently on our production server.  I can dig out these exact versions if someone thinks it will help.p  pThis is an app I inherited, so my knowledge of SSL and Indy is limited.  This app is at the end of its life, so upgrading to Indy 10 is not something my company is going to fund.  Any help or pointers or hints are extremely welcome, and my thanks would be infinite. Thank you so much Stackers      p

Negative 694 pSo Im trying to implement the following scenariop  ul liAn application is protected by Basic Authentication. Lets say it is hosted on codeapp.comcodeli liAn HTTP proxy, in front of the application, requires authentication as well. It is hosted on codeproxy.comcodeli ul  pThe user must therefore provide credentials for both the proxy and the application in the same request, thus he has different usernamepassword pairs one pair to authenticate himself against the application, and another usernamepassword pair to authenticate himself against the proxy.p  pAfter reading the specs, Im not really sure on how I should implement this. What I was thinking to do isp  ol liThe user makes an HTTP request to the proxy without any sort of authentication.li liThe proxy answers code407 Proxy Authentication Requiredcode and returns a codeProxyAuthenticatecode header in the format of codeProxyAuthenticate Basic realmproxy.comcode.br strongQuestionstrong Is this codeProxyAuthenticatecode header correctly setli liThe client then retries the request with a codeProxyAuthorizationcode header, that is the Base64 representation of the proxy codeusernamepasswordcode.li liThis time the proxy authenticates the request, but then the application answers with a code401 Unauthorizedcode header. The user was authenticated by the proxy, but not by the application. The application adds a codeWWWAuthenticatecode header to the response like codeWWWAuthenticate Basic realmapp.comcode. strongQuestionstrong this header value is correct rightli liThe client retries again the request with both a codeProxyAuthorizationcode header, and a codeAuthorizationcode header valued with the Base64 representation of the apps codeusernamepasswordcode.li liAt this point, the proxy successfully authenticates the request, forwards the request to the application that authenticates the user as well. And the client finally gets a response back.li ol  pIs the whole workflow correctp
Negative 694 pApologies in advance if Im using the wrong terminology, Im pretty new to jQuery. p  pIm working on a site with a responsive design.

Negative 694 pIve been struggling a while now with web services in Eclipse. Every time I get something working, it merely seems to be based on luck and Ive tried everything in numerous ways.p  pMy latest problem involves the following Ive got a java application which uses a lot of external references jars. Ive exported this java project to a simple jar file using the Fatjar plugin httpfjep.sourceforge.net to make sure the exported jar contains all the needed resources. I then created a dynamic web project and added the jar from before to this project. When I do some basic tests, everything works fine, i.e. Eclipse finds all the needed references.p  pHowever, when I try to create a web service, whose methods use the exact same logic as the tests, I get errors.

Negative 694 pWe are working on an application in CakePHP that will be used by multiple companies. We want to ensure performance, scalability, code manageability and security for our application.p  pOur current beta version creates a new database for each customer. When a new company joins the site we run a SQL  script to create a blank database. This has the following advantages   Better security companies users are separated from each other    We can set the database via the subdomain IE monkey.site.com, uses the sitemonkey database   Single code base.   Performance for SQL queries is generally quite good as data is split across smaller databases. p  pNow unfortunately this has many disadvantages   Manageability changes to database have to happen across all existing databases   The SQL script method of creation is clunky and not as reliable as we would like   We want to allow users to login from the home page EG. www.site.com but we cant currently do this as the subdomain determines what database to use.   We would like a central place to keep metricscustomer usage. p  pSo we are tornundecided as to what is the best solution to our database structure for our application. p  pCurrently we see three options   Keep multiple database design   Merge all companies into one DB and identify each by a companyId   Some kind of split model, where certain tables are in a core database and others are in a customer specific database.p  pCan you guys offer some of your precious advise  on how you think we should best do this Any feedback  info would be greatly appreciated.p  pMany thanks,p  pkSeudo p

Negative 694 pAndroid experts, I need some help.  Im an Android noob.  I have an application where I need to draw a bitmap using canvas from outside the main UI thread.  I stumbled onto the SurfaceView class and mocked up a quick demo.  I created a seperate bitmap instance and draw into it.  When the OnDraw for the surfaceView occurs, I copy this bitmap into the SurfaceView.  It works great until the activity ends by, for example, going back to the home screen.  At that point, the SurfaceView thread seems to stop, and I seem to lose the bitmap image I was working on.  When you return to the app, it starts all over from scratch.p  pI would like to create the bitmap image using the canvas 2D drawing calls from a thread that is seperate from the main UI thread for performance reasons.  I need to get that bitmap into the main user interface once in awhile.  And I need the bitmap image to be retained and continue to be drawn into to keep it current when the activity is paused or stopped.p  pSince you must do all drawing in the main UI thread the SurfaceView seems like the only solution.  But it doesnt quite work like I hoped either.p  pI need a background task or thread that NEVER stops running and I need to create a bitmap image there, and I need to get that bitmap into the main user interface once in awhile say 10 hz updates.p  pHELP  How do I do thisp

Negative 694 pI was building a page for displaying Instragram photos when I ran into an architectural problem that I dont know how to solve.p  pI have a collection of users, each of whom has an associated token that I can query on the Instagram API to get an uptodate list of photos taken by that user.p  pI want to have a page that simply lists a few photos from each user in my collection. That said, I want the page to have a couple characteristicsp  ol liTotally uptodate. Users should take a photo on Instagram, reload the page, and see their photo appear right away.li liAs fast as possible.li liNot particularly AJAXbased if I can avoid it.li ol  pThe really stupid implementation I wrote last night sacrificed speed to ensure it was up to date. In Django, it was roughlyp  precodedef instagrampagerequest     allimages  []     for user in InstagramUsers.objects.all           r  requests.getinstagramurl  user.token  returns JSON          images  json.loadsr.text[data]          allimages.extendimages     context  RequestContextrequest, images allimages     return rendertoresponseinstagrampage.html, context codepre  pBasically for each user in the database, query Instagram for an uptodate list, then populate the response with this list. Obviously, this is totally wrong. I am making multiple HTTP requests of Instagram inside my own requestresponse cycle. I could do something to parallelize the queries, but it would still be wrong for the simple fact that if the connection to Instagram hangs, the user will never get a response from my server.p  pMy question is, what is the right way to do this I can think of solutions that involve more moving parts for example, the server sends a response with a blank template, or maybe just a list of URLs to query, and the client uses AJAX to fill in the image URLs by querying Instagram directly. Is there a simpler solutionp

Negative 694 pWe have a number of different old school clientserver C WinForm clientside apps that are essentially frontends for the database.  Then there is a C serverside windows service that waits on the client apps to submit orders and then it processes them. p  pThe way the serverside service finds out whether there is work to do is that it polls the database.  Over the years the logic of polling for waiting orders has gotten a lot more complicated due to the myriad of business rules.  So because of this, the polling stored proc itself uses quite a bit of SQL Server resources even if there is nothing to do.  Add to this the requirement that the orders be processed the moment they are submitted and you got yourself a performance problem, as the database is being polled constantly.  p  pThe setup actually works fine right now, but the load is about to go through the roof and, it is obvious, that it wont hold up.p  pWhat are some effective ways to communicate between a bunch of different clientside apps and a serverside windows service, that will be more futureproof than the current method  p  pThe database server is SQL Server 2005.  I can probably get the powers that be to pony up for latest SQL Server if it really comes to that, but Id rather not fight that battle.  p

Negative 694 pI have searched your database of questions and find questions related to my problem but not an exact answer so I hope someone can help me. I am very new to all this so appologies if I dont use the right terminology. I am simply looking to root my device, though I hope answers to my question will help other people too. p  pFollowing instructions I researched, I installed the android SDK on my Windows 7 64 Bit machine. I then replaced the USB driver in the extrasgoogle folder with a modified cyanogen driver, which, I was told, would facilitate communication with more devices. In control pannelsystemadvanced system settingsenvironmental varyablessystem varyablespath I added the adresses of the platform tools and tools folders within the sdk directory, seperated by semicolons as instructed. I then enabled debugging in the application settings menue. My computer showed that it was attempting to install drivers. However, when I opened a command prompt and typed add devices I was told that Windows didnt recognise this command. This was anticipated in the instructions I read so I restarted my computer first, which didnt work and then tried to make sure the driver was installed through device manager. I browsed for the .inf file and clicked on it. Device manager returned the error that there wasnt an appropriate file in the directory and that I should make sure the driver was compatible with a 64 bit system. p  pThe upshot of all this is that, as far as I can tell, my device is not added and therefore I cant proceed. I would very much appreciate any help that you could provide, p  pThanks, p  pJustin p

Negative 694 pFirst a general explanation, and then what I am actually working on Let say you have a group of apples. Some properties could be shared, such as codetype  Green Applecode and codepickeddate  Aug 12 2012code, but other data could be different between apples, such as codeisbruisedcode and codeweightcode or codesizecode. What is the most pythonic way to have emeditableem values shared between apples such as codetypecode but also have individual attributes for each apple in the group Coming from codeCcode, codeCcode, my first instinct is a general struct, and a struct for each apple with a pointer to the general struct, as it seems silly for each apple instance to contain the group information, because if I wanted codetype  Red Applecode Id have to iterate though all the apples to edit their codetypecode value, which is a waste of programming power.p  pIn real code, on my current work project, I am currently working on a git script to help parse output in a way that makes sense for my company. I have been reading up on a lists, b tuples, c dictionaries, and d classes in python, and I am really stuck trying to figure out the best way to represent this data.p  pTo be specific, I am handling git commits, and there are two types of values I am concerned with general properties shared between all commits, such as do I print out the author of the commit, and specific properties such as commit x has author y. My current solution is inelegantp  precodeclass Commitobject     def initself, author, committer, date, issue,                  instruction, message, review, sha, short         self.author  author              self.committer  committer            self.date  date           self.instruction  instruction                  self.issue  issue         self.message  message         self.review  review                    self.sha  sha         self.short  short codepre  pThis class contains the data associated with a specific commit. Now, the data for all commits is stored as suchp  precode Attribute  namedtupleAttribute, [display, critical]   commitattr  author Attributedisplay  True, critical  True,                 committer Attributedisplay  True, critical  True,                 date Attributedisplay  False, critical  False,                 instruction Attributedisplay  True, critical  False,                 issue Attributedisplay  True, critical  False,                 message Attributedisplay  True, critical  False,                 review Attributedisplay  True, critical  False,                 sha Attributedisplay  True, critical  True,                 short Attributedisplay  True, critical  True codepre  pWhich is a dictionary with named tuples for the fields. Critical indicates if that field is required in a commit for it to be shown, display is used to determine if it should be printed or not.p  pHeres my problem I know that related data in python should be grouped in a coherent method, but I dont know how to do that here I could have a pointer, such as codeself.attr   commitattrcode in the codeCommitcode class, but this isnt very clean and would depend on that object keeping its address, i.e. being mutable, otherwise if I changed the value of the general attributes it would no longer be associated with the codeCommitcode class.p

The redesign went great, but our only AddOn to the project, an inhouse created plugin for tax calculation, now will not work. No changes were made to the plugin and I can confirm that it was working up until the redesign. All of our changes to the site were cosmetic in nature. ASPDotNetStoreFront uses an ERP Provider for AddOns a hrefhttpmanual.aspdotnetstorefront.compdfASPDNSF20ERP20Provider20SyncV3.pdf5d relnofollowas detailed in this PDFa Im familiar with the provider only through this project and have little experience with it elsewhere, which may explain some of my issues with it.p  pThe weird part is that ASPDotNetStoreFront is recognizing that the AddOn exists and fails when attempting to invoke the contract for it. In this case, its using ITaxRates and is trying to invoke ITaxRatesContract. This happens every time I try to activate it and I get the following errorp  precodePage URLshoppingcart.aspx SourceAnonymously Hosted DynamicMethods Assembly MessageUnable to cast transparent proxy to type AspDotNetStorefront.Contracts.ITaxRatesContract.

I dont know if that actually emshouldem make a difference, but at this point, Im willing to go with anything.pli lipIve attempted to clean the project, as well as the pipeline the AddIns use to the same results. No luck.pli ul  pIve been racking my head around this one for the last day and its getting on my last nerve. Any help would be super mega ultra appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 694 pNB this is really a question for Jython devotees but seems to highlight a design difficulty in the languagep  pif I do sthg like thisp  precodeclass XTreeModel DefaultTreeModel      def fireTreeNodesInserted self, source, path, childindices, children      print fire nodes inserted     super XTreeModel, self .fireTreeNodesInserted source, path, childindices, children  codepre  pI get infinite recursion. When I first encountered this I was very puzzled. I still dont understand why the code cant call the Java superclass baseclass method, and instead calls itself again . To prevent this I go p  precodeclass XTreeModel DefaultTreeModel      def fireTreeNodesInserted self, source, path, childindices, children      print fire nodes inserted     self.superfireTreeNodesInserted source, path, childindices, children  codepre  p... and I have learnt since starting to use Jython that these Javabaseclasscalling superXXX methods are in fact created spontaneously by the Jython interpreter, and only if you override a Java method in a Jython class which subclasses a Java class as above. This is OK as far as it goes... but what if you dont know whether your superclass baseclass is or is not a Java class I eventually developed the following utility methodp  precodedef getsupermethod caller, codeclass    stack1  inspect.stack[ 1 ]   funcname  stack1[ 3 ]    unfortunately this will return codeclass.funcname as standard if codeclass is a derived from a Java class with method funcname   supposedbaseclassmethod  getattr super codeclass, caller , funcname    for baseclass in caller.class.base.mro     if org.python.proxies in str baseclass         ... this means we have reached down as low as a Java proxy class without yet encountering a class with a method funcname,        which means that we must return the superXXX version       break      confusingly, even if you go caller.class.base.mro this still shows all the classes for caller, including its highest class      if baseclass  codeclass       continue     if funcname in baseclass.dict        ... a method with the right name exists in a baseclass...       return supposedbaseclassmethod    javabaseclassmethod  getattr caller, supers  funcname    return javabaseclassmethod codepre  pwhich you call by going, for example p  precodeclass XTreeModel DefaultTreeModel      def fireTreeNodesInserted self, source, path, childindices, children      print X fire nodes inserted     getsupermethod self, XTreeModel source, path, childindices, children   class XXTreeModel XTreeModel      def fireTreeNodesInserted self, source, path, childindices, children      print XX fire nodes inserted     getsupermethod self, XXTreeModel source, path, childindices, children  codepre  pHere getsupermethod in XXTreeModel returns super XXTreeModel, self ... whereas getsupermethod in XTreeModel returns self.superfireTreeNodesInserted so... maybe you could just look at the codeclass passed to getsupermethod and if it has org.python.proxies in the name of its immediate baseclass that means you return the superXXX version, right Er, no, its a bit more complicatedp  precodeclass XTreeModel DefaultTreeModel      def dosomestuff self      print do stuff  class XXTreeModel XTreeModel      def fireTreeNodesInserted self, source, path, childindices, children      print XX fire nodes inserted     getsupermethod self, XXTreeModel source, path, childindices, children  codepre  pIn this example, the XXTreeModel has a Jython class as its baseclass but this baseclass XTreeModel doesnt override the method of interest... so in fact getsupermethod in XXTreeModel needs to return super fireTreeNodesInserted... ... so this utility method seems to solve the problem you dont need to know what type of class your baseclass is, whether or not it overrides the Java method, etc. Anyway, I wanted to find out whether this tortuous procedure was necessary, but googling jython super etc. produced bug entries from 10 years ago saying things like use of super methods is deprecated.p  pIs there a better way to accomplish this calling of the superclass methods where your first baseclass as you move down through the classes with the method sought is in fact a Java classp

Negative 694 p...and by no reason I mean for a reason Im clearly and likely blatently overlooking. This is such a NOOB question  but I for the life of me cant figure out whats going wrong with my floating divs.p  pAs seen here a hrefhttpcodysilfies.comkenjibeta.html relnofollowhttpcodysilfies.comkenjibeta.htmlap  pIve got a Container div Wrapper, which houses a few divs  among them a content area content which has a menu menu that floats left and a div to house text which doesnt have an ID just yet.p  pI THOUGHT that aligning them both left would have the two divs sit right against each other but its not working that way.  The box with text overlaps the menu messing with the layout.  I also have to place the text PRIOR to the menu in the code or else itll show up below the main menu which shouldnt be normal behavior  it should sit against the other divp  pI know I can set a width and float the text RIGHT  but its been requested that the page resize with the browser page.p  pI know its something stupid and simple that Im overlooking...but I cant see it.

I have a set of correspopnding points . and i have my camera details. for example i have focus details,Rotation and Translation matrix44. and i want to project my points in 3Dtriangulation. so as far as i got to know its pretty straight forward by factor algebra. But i still need to understand it clearly . has anyone has an idea about how to follow this  i am working to matlab so i need to implement that i may be again too broad or whatever.

Negative 694 pIm building an ASP.NET MVC website with a WCF webservice backend that talks to the database via NHibernate. At the moment as POC I have one webservice called UserService which contains all the methods I need. The problem I have is that I have a DataRepository object which wraps the NHibernate configuration. When I create a new data repository object it loads the NHibernate configuration and mappings and cache etc. For my website in the users session, I want to keep this DataRepository object open for the life of their session as it doesnt make sense to keep reconfiguring NHibernate on a percall basis and I want the same data repository to be available for all the webservice methods to benefit from NHibernate caching. p  pIs the answer here to make a static DataRepository object at the UserService.cs class level and configure the website to instantiate on a persession basis, and would that mean each users session contains its own static datarepository object for the life of their session Or is there a better way Is there anything I havent thought of with the above approachp

Negative 694 pThis program is to convert a column of data from cumulative to noncumulative. On my sheet I have A1, B1, and C1 with the text NonCumulative, Cumulative, and Converted, respectively. I have numbers 1 to 10 beneath A1, then them summed cumulatively beneath B1. C1 is where I want to convert column B back to noncumulative.p  pThe IsNumeric is used to make the first row of data in C equal to the first row of data in B. It should detect that the title is above the number it is evaluating, thus knowing that no calculations have to be performed. For the rest of them, itll see that the number above the one it is evaluating is a number, and thus the calculation has to be done.p  pMy problem is that it isnt working. I think the reason is because IsNumeric keeps coming back as false.

Negative 694 pIve just started dabbling with SFML 2.0 for C Using Visual Studio 2010, and Ive run into an error that Im not sure how to deal with. If the game has any kind of Text, whenever I close the program while running it in Debug mode through the IDE, I get an error stating the followingp  blockquote   pUnhandled exception at 0x533c6d34 in .exe 0xC0000005 Access violation reading location 0x00000008.p blockquote  pI dont know whether those hex values are always the same, but I know that the only time I get the error is when I use Text. Is this a common issue I know SFML 2.0 isnt official, so it could just be a bug.p  pFor what its worth, when I try running the program as an application and not through the IDE, I dont have any problems. Its still something I feel like I should resolve.p  pEDIT Its also worth mentioning that Ive been following tutorials, so my code is mostly whats contained therein.p

Negative 694 pIm developing a web application which waits for N say, around 5 users to connect to a webservice via a TCP socket. The server keeps track of the number of sockets connected, and once it reaches N he then sends a single file, say up to 2MB, to all of them simultaneously. The emphasis here is on timing  they should all receive the file at the same time, rather than one after the other.p  pAs a newbie to c and socket programming, I wish to know what would be the best approach in this case  I thought of the following  The server asynchronously receives socket connections and once it reaches N, loops through all of the bytes in the file, and on each iteration sends a single Kbyte or maybe less to each one of the clients connected  this, in my opinion, is the closest way to sending a file simultaneously.  p  pIm kind of confused about how to implement this.  Any help would be great. Thanksp  pEDIT by receiving at the same time I meant, technically, that I dont want the server sending the file to the first client, then to the second, then to the third etc, but rather send it to all of them at once, once its out of the server, its out of my hands Assuming there are no network problems, and the clients are all very near physically, they should receive the file more or less at the same time. maybe the solution is simpler than I thought...p

Negative 694 pCurrently our PHP app requires to be set up in the web servers document root usually by configuring Apaches virtual hosts. p  pThe main reason for that dependency is that our URLgeneration logic assumes that all URLs can be accessed through the absolute path codecode. That makes for easy linking to resources such as images, and pages.p  pThe user may be visiting the app from different subfolders, so we cannot assume a simple relative path to work.p  pHow would we decouple the app from needing to run in the document root of the web server Would you suggest parsing codeSERVER[DOCUMENTROOT]code in that URL controller to try to decide how far down in the filesystem the file is being accessed Right now, I dont see a surefire way of doing that parsing. Also a complication here is that we use Apaches ReRewrite so URLs dont necessarily match the file system.p

No shadows, no anything.p  pI tried replicating this with a NSView subclass 6px high instead so 2 separate objects, but the view is drawing itself too much when Im scrolling fast, there seems to be some kind of lag though I do nothing more than NSRectFill[self bounds]. p  pThats why I want to subclass NSTextField instead.p

Negative 694 pBasically, my idea was to write some sort of basic server where I could connect to my computer and then run a command remotely.

Validation works normal on the fields who are on that moment regular input fields. p  pthe issue occurs when the lists are not empty, so when there is at least one or multiple options to choose from. As you can see in the form snippet, when there actually are options, the input fields become select fields. it is then that the form does not pass validation, even though the fields are not empty and the value has a size greater then 2. p  pthis really puzzles me. i have been googling for known issues with select fields, i have seen quite some posts here on this forum, but none of the suggested solutions work or would work i must admit, i havent tried them all as some seem really not fitted for what i want. p  pany thoughts p  pthanks in advance.p

Negative 694 pI have an image which is essentially a starburst effect. The color of the starburst is white, and the background is transparent PNG w Alpha. I randomly generate these starbursts onto an HTML5 canvas at random locations, and at the same time, generate random Hue, Saturation, and Light HSL values. These could be RGB values, if this simplifies things.p  pThe goal is to recolorize the PNG for display on the HTML5 canvas based on the randomly generated HLS values before rendering it to the canvas.p  pIve read some other posts on StackOverflow and other sites, but the only solutions Ive seen involve rendering it to the canvas, grabbing the coordinates for where the image is displaying, and modify the color on a pixelbypixel basis. In theory this could work, however some of the images may overlap slightly. Also if there is a background already present, then from what I understand, the backgrounds color would also be modified which isnt much of a solutions for me either.p  pIf this is out of the realm of what Canvases are capable of, as a fallback I suppose I would be okay with having images dynamically recolored via PHP using GD2 or Imagick, or via the commandline via Gimp, ImageMagick or some other image library...p  pThanks muchp  pb OUTCOME bp  pSpecial thanks to jing3142 for initial suggestion of offscreen canvas rendering, and Jarrod for providing the vital piece I was missing codeglobalCompositeOperation  sourceincodep  pHere is a working implementation of the concept a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netfwtW22 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netfwtW22ap  pWorks inp  ul liChromeli liFirefoxli liIE 9 havent tested other versionsli ul

Negative 694 pI recently ran into a surprising fact after staging my Play 2 project. I had two configuration files, strongapplication.confstrong, and strongprod.confstrong which get placed into strongtargetscala2.10stagedclassesstrong when I stage the application. When I call strong.start Dconfig.resourceapplication.confstrong or strong.start Dconfig.resourceprod.confstrong, the application starts up with the specified configuration files. But when I delete both the configuration files from strongtargetscala2.10stagedclassesstrong, the application still starts  p  pFor this reason, I think these configuration files must be baked into the application elsewhere. Where is the application actually looking in order to find the configuration filesp

Negative 694 pI want to know the applicability of the Akka Actor model.p  pI know it is useful in the case a huge number of Actor instances are created and destroyed. e.g. a call server, where every incoming call creates an actor instance and communicates with few other actors and get killed after the call is over.p  pemIs it also useful in the following scenario emp  pA server has a few processing elements 1050 implemented over Actors. The lifetime of these processing elements is infinite. some of them do not maintain state and a few maintain state. The processing elements process the message and pass the message to other actors in a fixed manner. The system receives a huge number of messages from outside and gets passed through processing elements and goes out of the system.p  pMy gut feeling is that we cannot get any advantage by using Akka Actor model and even implementing this server in Scala. Because the use case for which Akka is designed, is not applicable here. If the scaleup meant that processing elements be increased dynamically then it would be applicable. p  pFor fixed topologies, I think if i implement it in Java, it is going to be more beneficial in terms of raw performance. The immutability feature of Scala leads to more copies and so reduces performance. So i believe i better stick to Java.p  pIs my understanding correct I a nut shell i want to know why i should leave Java and use ScalaAkka for the application scenario above. and my target is to process 1 million messages per second.p

This unique key allows me to ensure that no duplicated codeEventContractcodes are created, but more importantly it allows me to keep an easy to lookup collection of all of the codeEventContractcodes an object has, such that I can callp  precodecat.dispose codepre  pand all of the event contracts for codecatcode will be destroyed, so I am confident that all of the external references to cat have been deleted and cat can now be GCd.p  pBut I am finding it hard to implement this functionality in Dart, because doing something like codecat.ondog, bark, cat.runawaycode causes a new function to be generated to enclose codecat.runawaycode and the only unique key I can get off of a standard function object in dart is its hashCode, but that means I can recall codecat.ondog, bark, cat.runawaycode and it will create a new codeEventContractcode because it has created another unique closure rather than processing a reference to the original function, as happens in javascript.p  pIs there anyway for me to achieve this pattern in dartp

The sole provided implementation is codeLegacyTlsAuthenticationcode, which adapts upon nowdeprecated a hrefhttpwww.bouncycastle.orgdocsdocs1.5onorgbouncycastlecryptotlsCertificateVerifyer.html relnofollowcodeCertificateVerifyercodea interface, which has only a hrefhttpwww.bouncycastle.orgdocsdocs1.5onorgbouncycastlecryptotlsAlwaysValidVerifyer.html relnofollowcodeAlwaysValidVerifyercodea implementation thats just dummy codereturn truecode under the hood.p  pSo, this is what I have for nowp  precodeDefaultTlsClient tlsClient  new DefaultTlsClient      Override     public TlsAuthentication getAuthentication throws IOException          TlsAuthentication auth  new TlsAuthentication              Override             public void notifyServerCertificateCertificate serverCertificate                   Here I should validate certificate chain, but this far                  I only managed to print subjects for debugging purposes.                 for org.bouncycastle.asn1.x509.Certificate c  serverCertificate.getCerts                      System.out.printlnCertificate   c.getSubject.toString                                            Override             public TlsCredentials getClientCredentialsCertificateRequest cr throws IOException                  return null                               return auth        socket  new Sockethostname, port tlsHandler  new TlsProtocolHandlersocket.getInputStream, socket.getOutputStream tlsHandler.connecttlsClient codepre  pHowever, I fail to understand or find any existing example that would check one codeorg.bouncycastle.asn1.x509.Certificatecode for being correctly signed by another one. Could someone provide some pointers to me, pleasep  pIm using BounceCastles proprietary API due to need to use ciphersuites that default Java installations do not allow due to being subject to US cryptographic policy jurisdiction restrictions.

I dont know javascript, but I would imagine it would look likep  precode  function OnScrollDiv div  var n  prodcont.scrollTop if n  0      nothing   else      .up.show              codepre  pBut alas, this does not work.  At all.  Any suggestionsp

Negative 694 pI need to write a system that can have various types of user logged in, each with their own different set of data stored in the model.

But they all need to log in through the same interface, and get directed to the right place, and only be able to do what their class of user should be able to, and only see what they should.p  pBut it seems like I cant just use the regular authentication methods since it cant search multiple models as far as I can tell. I came across this snippet a hrefhttpdjangosnippets.orgsnippets2546 relnofollowhttpdjangosnippets.orgsnippets2546a which might be useful, but Im not sure if this is really the best way to do it, or if I should just deal with having a lot of empty fields and just have one user class and use the permissions system.

I inevitably wind up with about 15 rows missing from the html table I generated.p  pThe relevant code from my FogManager model is thisp  precodedef connect   connection  FogStorage.new     provider              AWS,     awsaccesskeyid     AWSACCESSKEY,     awssecretaccesskey AWSSECRETKEY,     persistent            true    end  def locatedirectory   directory  connection.directories.getDIRECTORY end  def uploadreportpageindexfile   file  directory.files.getindexfile   file.body  File.openindexfile   file.acl  publicread   file.save end codepre  pMy script looks something likep  precodefilename  index.html  s3  FogManager.new s3.connect s3.locatedirectory   code for generating the html page  s3.uploadreportpagefilename codepre  pAll of the code works, but the whole html file isnt getting uploaded to s3.p  pIm using the latest version of fog 1.15.0 with ruby 2.0.0p0p  pIve been able to manually go into irb and establish an s3 connection, locate the file, and upload the new one. I use these commandsp  precoderequire fog  connection  FogStorageprovider AWS,                            awsaccesskeyid xxx,                            awssecretaccesskey xxx,                           persistent true  directory  connection.directories.getmydirectory  file  directory.files.getindex.html file.body  File.openindex.html file.acl  publicread file.save codepre  pWhen I upload the file this way, it works properly, and the whole file gets uploaded, but it defeats the purpose of having the script.p  pAny insight would be greatly appreciatedp
Negative 694 pI have the following problem I need to optimize. For a given arraywith duplicated keys allowed, for each position codeicode in the array, I need to compute all bigger values right of codeicode, and all smaller values left of codeicode. If we havep  pcode1 1 4 3 5 6 7code and codei  3codevalue 3, the count of smaller values to left of codeicode is code1codeno repeated keys, and to the right, the number of bigger values is code3code.p  pThe brute force solution of this problem is codeN2code, and with some extra space I can manage to compute the smaller values from the bigger ones, so reducing complexity to codeN22code. My question is is there a faster way to get it done Maybe codeNlgNcode I imagine there is a data structure out there I dont know which will allow me to do the computation faster.p  pstrongEDITstrong Thank you all for your replies and discussions. You can find two good solutions two the problem below. Always a pleasure learning from developers in stackoverflow. p

Negative 694 pI have the following code where I have to enter 2 arguments as an input where The 1st argument is a number. If this number is multiple of 2, then 15 child processes will be created with fork. If the number is multiple of 3, 10 processes will be created. If the number is multiple of 5, 7 processes will be created. The 2nd argument is a file where its size in bytes will be divided into the number of processes created and each child process is going to read one part of the file, they save that part into a variable and finally the parent shows all the text in that variable. For example, I run the program with .p 5 homedirectoryFile.c. So Im having 7 child processes and lets say the filesize is 700 bytes. That means every child process should read 100 bytes, they save it into a variable appending the content and finally the parent shows all the content together. The problem is that the variable textToSend that should show all the content in the parent doesnt show anything... I believe there should be a problem with the sprintf line in the child.p  precodegcc Test.c o p .p 5 homedirectoryFile.c  include ltstdio.hgt include lterrno.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include ltsysstat.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include ltdirent.hgt include ltsyswait.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]      int studentId, children  0, j, i, childNumber[15], fdFile, fdread     float bytesToRead     char directory[50]     char buffer  malloc256, textToSend  malloc256      systemclear      ifargc1 lt 1              printfnSome arguments are missingn         return EXITFAILURE           studentId  atoiargv[1]     strcpydirectory,argv[2]      ifstudentId2  0              children  15          else              ifstudentId3  0                      children  10                  else                      ifstudentId5  0                              children  7                          else                              printfnStudentId is not multiple of 2, 3 o 5n                 return EXITFAILURE                                 struct stat fileInfo     statargv[2],ampfileInfo      bytesToRead  fileInfo.stsize  children      printfchildren dn,children     printfFile Size lldn,long long int fileInfo.stsize     printfBytes .2fn,bytesToRead      fdFile  opendirectory,ORDONLY              iffdFile  1                              printfnError opening the fileon                 return EXITFAILURE                   fori0iltchildreni              childNumber[i]  fork          ifchildNumber[i]  1                      printfnError creating the child processn             return EXITFAILURE                   ifchildNumber[i]  0                      fdread  readfdFile,buffer,bytesToRead              iffdread  1                              printfnError reading the filen                 return EXITFAILURE                           printfs,buffer             printfnnnn              sprintftextToSend,ss,textToSend,buffer              return EXITSUCCESS                  else                      waitpidchildNumber[i],NULL,WNOHANG                    printfnThis is the content of the file sn,textToSend      closefdFile      forj0jltchildrenj              waitNULL           return EXITSUCCESS  codepre  pWhat could happen The buffer is showing a part of the file correctly...

Negative 694 pIm creating a ASP.NET .NET 4.0 website and part of this site requires that there is an always running application. Normally, I would create a Windows Service for this, but the site will be hosted within a shared hosting environment, and unless I get a virtual server, then this isnt a possibility.p  pMy first thought was to have a thread running in the background that would do this and it would be created on ApplicationStart and destroyed on ApplicationEnd. Ive looked around and this seems like it could be an option, but I would of course have to hit the site in order to cause the ApplicationStart to be called and if the associated AppPool is recylced, then this process would have to be repeated so I believe.p  pWithin a normal ASP.NET website does these seem possible I m developing an ASP.NETwith sql server application.p

Its inside an extra QML File called MyElem.qml which used as delegate elem for a listview. This means while running there is more than one of MyElem loaded and all of them have the same id myRectangle. Is this the reason why I dont see any visual changes p

Negative 694 pIm trying to figure out the correct syntax for explicit specialization of a nested template class.

I have a suspicion that it is not possible to explicitly specialize the Iterator class without an explicit specialization of the containing class, Matrix.  But I would be very happy if there is a way to do this.p  pI know I emcouldem make the Iterator class a separate class, not a member of the Matrix class, but having the classes nested as such allows me full access to the template parameters and datamebers of the Matrix class, which simplifies things.  I know I could work around this if I need to, but Id first like to investigate and understand the possibilities for the nested approach.p  pThanks, Shmuelp

Negative 694 pIm working on a script that generates a PHP table containing some values from a MySQL database. The script will be displayed on a TV, so I need to break it if its height is greater than 1280 ive got this value by completing it with values till it fits perfect, then Ive used jQuery alert to display its height and I will use codejquery.cycle.allcode plugin to create a slideshow from the tables.p  pMy solution was to use a PHP variable and increment it on each generated  then if I have lets say 13 rows, it echoes codelttablegtlttablegtcode, but the cells must have an exact width so it may add a new line of text if I have a longer text on a cell and the table will have more than 1280px height. p  pDoes anybody have any idea about how I can solve thisp

Negative 694 pI am working on a homework problem related to presentation formatting, and I was hoping to get pointed towards the right direction. The homework problem isp  blockquote   pDifferent architectures have different conventions on bit order as   well as byte order                  whether the least significant bit   of a byte, for example, is bit 0 or bit 7. RFC 791 [Pos81]br   defines in its Appendix B the standard network bit order. Why is bit   order then not relevant to presentation formattingp blockquote  pIm confused at how bit order would emnotem be relevant to presentation formatting. Presentation formatting encodes the data so it can travel through the network, and then decodes the data at the receiving end so the data can be used. But I know the decoding process has to take into account the architecture of the receiving computer in order for the data to be interpreted correctly, this includes bit and byte order. In fact, that is what these conversion strategies such as canonical intermediate form and receivermakesright are for  they make sure the data is converted into a format that will allow it to travel through the network and also be interpreted by the receiving host application.p  pMy idea of what the answer could be is that presentation decoding occurs in the application layer, because only the application knows what format it wants the data to be in. Thus, the receiving hosts architecture is not something presentation formatting worries about because it knows that it will take care of converting the data. p  pIs there something Im misunderstandingp  pThanks for the help. p

Negative 694 pI wonder if is there a way to pan the audio of a video with JavaScript.p  pThe same way you can adjust volume, I need to pan an stereo audio left to right or right to left.p  pThis feature would be useful for multilingual events where you can produce a video in two languages using stereo, for instance, pan english audio to left and german translation to right. Then the player could transform the stereo track into mono muting one of the languages depending on user election.p  pI already implemented this feature in flash using SoundTransform class a hrefhttphelp.adobe.comenUSFlashPlatformreferenceactionscript3flashmediaSoundTransform.htmlpan relnofollowhttphelp.adobe.comenUSFlashPlatformreferenceactionscript3flashmediaSoundTransform.htmlpana.p  pI guess SoundTransform htmlequivalent is AudioContext a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRwebaudioAudioContextsection relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgTRwebaudioAudioContextsectiona.p  pMay I access the audio context of a playing videop  pstrongUPDATEstrong After some intensive research I found out the solution.

Negative 694 pI have recently been developing a mobile site to be run in a mobile browser that displays sports events and betting markets. We have implemented a CSSJavascript scrolling solution iScroll was causing us too many issues. We have an All Games page that displays 2 markets for every event in the database. Initially we are loading in 15 events around 30 markets, and then as the user reaches the bottom of the page loading in another 15. Once we load in the third lot of 15 ie page 3 we remove page 1 when we load in page 4 we remove page 2 etc, so we only ever have 2 pages of data in the DOM at once. This works fine on the iPhone but the scrolling on Samsung devices using the native browser particularly the S2 is slowing down the more pages we load. It also seems that when the user scrolls back up and the newer pages are removed, and the older ones loaded in again the scrolling speeds up again, and is fine by the time the user is back on page 2 and page 1. p  pGenerally, I know the native browser in the Samsungs especially S2 are slower at rendering, executing javascript etc, and our HTML is more complex than it should be a constraint of the framework we have inherited. Is there anything else obvious about the Samsungs that could be affecting thisp  pJust for background, we are using Ruby on Rails, JQuery and CSS our JS and CSS files are minified and weve removed everything that isnt necessary. Ive also done a run through the code and checked for memory leaks.p  pThanksp
Negative 694 pIm trying to understand the connection pooling in Datastax Cassandra Driver, so I can better use it in my web service.p  pI have version 1.0 of the documentation.

R. Martin certainly provided for a better story this time. I guess itamp8217s inevitable that this book would be better since the seriesamp8217 three most beloved characters Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and Tyrion Lannister return after being left out last time. But, besides that, we get to see the stories develop more progress, building up to something much bigger. If youamp8217ve read the other books in the series, or if youamp8217re a fantasy reader at all, ltspangtltigtA Dance with Dragonsltigtltspangt is certainly worth the read despite the time it takes to finish it.ltspangtltfontgtltpgtltpgtltfont color333333gtamp160ltfontgtltpgtltpgtltfont color333333gtOf course, I wonamp8217t say this novel is perfect. As much as it has improved from ltigtA Feast for Crowsltigt, this one still has some of that same stagnant feeling in which the characters donamp8217t seem to be going anywhere specific. Then again, a good bit of the cast has spoiler alert already been killed off by this point, so the rest just seem to be meandering around. Overall, it seems to be holding off until the sixth and seventh books, where the major events will finally conclude the story. However, thatamp8217s not to say absolutely nothing happens. As I mentioned above, the story development this time is much stronger than in the past.ltfontgtltpgtltpgtltfont color333333gtamp160ltfontgtltpgtltpgtltfont color333333gtWhat is also interesting about this book is that, towards the end, it begins to include all the characters again. In the fourth book and at least the first half of this one, Martin had separated the storylines by geography, not by chronology as he normally does, so the cast did feel a little thin for a while. Consequently, we are treated to that same experience that we had gotten used to, and hopefully this will continue on throughout the rest of the series.ltfontgtltpgtltpgtltfont color333333gtamp160ltfontgtltpgtltpgtltfont color333333gtPutting aside the noticeable features of this particular novel, we still find the same elements of the story in ltigtA Song of Ice and Fireltigt that weamp8212or, at least, Iamp8212enjoy most about George R.

Negative 694 pI have an activity that has a hashmap of 15 items. I want to pass it to another activity that uses those items. I am aware that using the Parcelable class is more efficient than serialising. However I wonder if there is any point or much value in creating an object to do the parceling and using intent.putExtra to pass it to the activity that requires it. It seems a little long and unnecessary or round about way of doing something  but I dont want the activity to implement parcelable because it isnt good for the design of the application in my opinion any advice or opinions on this way of doing it would be very much appreciated.p

Negative 694 pI have a situation where I want to use databinding from an ArrayCollection to populate text fields in a Flex view.p  pThe ArrayCollection is populated from an SQL Result object. I store the ArrayColelction in my model class using getters and setters like thisp  precodeprivate var monthlyDataArrayCollection  public function set monthlyDatavalueArrayCollectionvoid monthlyData  value   [Bindable] public function get monthlyDataArrayCollection return monthlyData  codepre  pI use the monthlyData as a dataprovider for a list etc which works fine. I also need to use properties at certain indexs in this collection as text field strings.  When the text field text properties are set I dont neccesarily have the monthlyData arrayCollection populated yet.p  pThe text fields are set in another outside class with has a singleton reference to this model so I set the fields like so at the momentp  precodetextField.text  model.monthlyData.getItemAt3.Month codepre  pI want to setup binding to the array collection instead of just using this assignment method so that when that item in the array is refreshed or the entire arrayCollection is populated or updated , it will update the textField text. Im having trouble getting the binding to work.p  pIm using bindageTools at the moment but have been also using the built in as3 BindingUtils to little effect.p  pI can do the following which sets the initial text property correctly, but it wont update when the ArrayCollection changesp  precodeBind.fromPropertymodel.monthlyData.getItemAt3,Month.toPropertytextField, text codepre  pSo if someone could please point me in the right direction as to which way is best to get the binding going in pure AS3 no MXML, Id really appreciate it.p  pCheers Marcop

Negative 694 pI was recently surprised to find that the finally block in this play framework controller action code only got called after an Exception, but never when the call actually succeeded.p  precodetry      InputStream is  getInputStreamMethod     renderBinaryis, out.zip catch Exception e      e.printStackTrace  finally      cleanUp  codepre  pPerhaps the thread is terminated or something when renderBinary is called, but to me, it was nonintuitive. I would suspect the same thing happens for other render calls, but I didnt verify it.p  pI solved the problem by moving the renderBinary to after the trycatch. Further investigation revealed that play provides an Finally annotation to create a method that gets executed after a controller action executes. The caveat here is that this will get called after the execution of ANY action in the controller, so it may not always be a good choice.p  pMy question is why does the finally block not get executed after a renderBinary, and is this documented anywhere I cant find any reference to it in the play doc.p  pTo clarify the sequence of events that led to this discoveryp  ol lipThe files that were supposed to be deleted as a result of the finally block were not deleted.pli lipThinking that it couldnt possibly be caused by a nonexecuting finally block, I changed the methodology to use the Amazon SQS Messaging Queue to send a message in the finally block  a separate job receives the message and deletes the associated files.pli lipThe messages were not getting sent.pli lipI set breakpoints in the code and determined that renderBinary was being called, but the finally block was not getting executed.pli lipJust to be safe, I added log messages to the finally clause, and these also were not present.pli lipI have repeated the debug exercise several times, and each time, the finally clause is not executed.pli ol  pemPlease note that the actual code doesnt really look like the above. This is a very simplified example just to illustrate the case.emp

Negative 694 pI have many measures of distinct count in a cube. My problem is that those measures count the null value as well. Ive found two solutions to eliminate the null valuep  ol lipIve created named queries in data source view for each measure where i put the condition that the column that i need does not contains  null [where column is not null] but this solution is not that practical, because if you have many measures, that do not need to count the null value you have to make a lot of fact tables as named queries to eliminate the nullpli lipIve created an additional column as Named calculation in the fact table, where i tested if the column that i need contains null to put 1 else to put 0 CASE WHEN Column IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0. After that i created a measure of maximum on this additional column and i created a measure of distinct count on the column that i needed . And finally, i created a calculation where i tested the following IIF[measure that i need] [Maximum of additional column]lt0,null,[measure that i need] [Maximum of additional column]pli ol  pBoth solutions works but my question is if there is another solution more simple than those two mentioned or if there is an option in SSAS.  If someone knows please share the information.p

Negative 694 pI.E  Combining least frequent or informative bigram frequency counts together.p  pE.G   If I have frequency counts of letter pairs for a sequence, whats a good way to merge similar features together. For example KR and RK into a single feature and so on, or combining all the pairs with a count of 0 together... p  pI know scikit learn has something called wards agglomerative clustering, but that seems aimed at visual datapixels, and im interested in text data emProtein sequences and bioinformaticsem. Id rather avoid clustering if theres a more direct method for concatenating the features together.  I lack background, and havent done clustering before, and analysis of the features is important to us. Thanksp
Negative 694 pI am currently developing a web site ASP.NET, which is localized for two languages, English and German. We are using Local Resource Files for all of the static content on the page and a global resource file  located in a different .dll  for most of the dynamic localized content.p  pSince monday, there has been a problem with the Global Resource File When the language is changed, the Local Resource File does change its language and displays German correctly, but the Global Resource File stays in English and we havent yet gotten it to change to German.p  pLanguage is changed using a Dropdownlist which is causing a postback and changing both p  pcodeThread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture  CultureInfo.GetCultureInfocultureInfocodep  pandp  pcodeThread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  CultureInfo.GetCultureInfocultureInfocodep  pin the InitializeCulture method.p  pSo far it was working, but as I said, we apparently changed something, so the language switch doesnt happen anymore.p  pIn our Unit Tests in the .dll the resource files are located in, the language change is still working correctly, but as soon as the dll is copied into the actual solution, it just doesnt seem to do anything anymore.p  pI have been searching desperately for any hints in the code and on the internet, but I havent found anything...p  pAny help or advise would be greatly appreciated If you have an idea and need more code examples, I would be happy to provide you anything you need.p  pThanks in advance,p  pLeonardp

Negative 694 pI have a problem with my navigation bar. It is looking great now, but if I add a positionfixed to my css, it messes everything up.

Negative 694 pPlease excuse me if this has been asked and answered and I will go read the information there. I am writing a system that wills tore user nameaddress among many other things. The name and address comes in on a weekly file feed so we have to determine when that information has changed and then update our system accordingly to reflect the new information. I have to always retain a record of what was what so if you see multiply entries, that is currently by design. p  pLet me lay out what models we have for this example fields simplified for examplep  precodeclass Member lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany addresses   hasmany names end  class Name lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto member    has fields of firstname and lastname for this example end  class Address lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto member    has fields of lineone, city, state and zipcode for this example  end codepre  pSo Im wondering what if any resources are available to compare the information in these records to something on a file and then update if needed. Obviously there will be fields in all models that have to be ignored and that arent on the file. p  pWould it be recommended to create unstored records and then compare the two objects some how Do I need to just to string comparisons and then updateadd records as needp  pI will try to clarify if Im asking this is in a poor way, obviously not wrapping my head around it very well yet.

Negative 694 pThis should be an easy question for anyone experienced working with ASP.NET MVC. I am just beginning finally to learn ASP.NET MVC. I have VS2012 Pro on my laptop. I just purchased and installed VS2013 Pro. When I go into my Win 7 Pro 64bit control panel, I expected to see either ASP.NET MVC 4 andor ASP.NET MVC 5 listed. But neither are there. Do I have to download and install MVC 4 and MVC 5 AFTER having installed VS2013 Pro I would have expected at least MVC 4 to have been installed automatically along with VS2013. TIA.p  pFinal note For those just getting started with VS2013 and wanting to do an MVC 5 project, I found a reference that shows exactly how to get to the MVC 5 template, such as it isp  pa hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsmvc5introductiongettingstarted relnofollowhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsmvc5introductiongettingstartedap  pIt is not that intuitive, there are several custom MVC 5 templates with varying bits and pieces of plumbing on NuGet when you look under the Online templates, but to just use the default MVC 5 plumbing for a new web application project, the article shows how to drill down to a template that is only named MVC, not MVC 5. If they hadnt dropped the number off the template it would have been more obvious, but thats Microsoft  p  pAnd finally, what it says at the top of this pagep  pThis question already has an answer here MVC3 missing in Visual Studio 2010 SP1p  pis NOT correct. That question does NOT provide the answer to this question, because the way MVC is deployed has changed throughout the visual studio versions, as one can see by reviewing all of the text on this page.p

So far Ive tried adding codeSetcode in front of the troublesome line I knew it wouldnt work, but I had to try anyway, and Ive made sure both functions are safe i.e. they do not divide by zero, and they always return a value.p  pHeres the StDev function modified to protect work confidentiality, but has same issuep  precodeFunction StDevrng As Range, Criteria1 As Variant, CriteriaRng1 As String, Optional avg As Variant As Variant     Call like this       StDev2IfsRange to StDev, Match this, Range to find Criteria1, [average]      If IsMissingavg Then         avg  Avgrng, Critera1, CriteriaRng1     End If      If avg ltgt NO DATA Then          Convert Strings to Ranges         Dim crng, crng1 As Range         Set crng  Application.Rangerng         Set crng1  Application.RangeCriteriaRng1          Get Column Indices         Dim r, r1As Long         r  crng.Columnscrng.Columns.Count.Column         r1  crng1.Columnscrng1.Columns.Count.Column          Calculate column offsets from range to stdev         Dim off1 As Long         off1  r1  r          x will be used to sum the elements         Dim x As Double         x  0         ct will be used to count number of elements         Dim ct As Double         ct  0         For Each cell In Rangerng             If cell.Offset, off1.Value  Criteria1 Then                 x  x  Squarecell.Value  avg                 ct  ct  1             End If         Next          Divide by count         If ct ltgt 0 Then             StDev  x  ct         Else             StDev  NO DATA         End If          Square Root         If ct ltgt 0 Then             StDev  StDev  1  2         End If     Else         StDev  NO DATA     End If End Function codepre  pAnybody have any ideasp

Negative 694 pIn an MVC application I have a namespace that contains specific model class. This class implements a specific interface and said interface has an extension class.p  pI put the extension class inside the same namespace as the model class and interface, however, the extension methods wont work in views unless I expose the namespace inside the views. Adding the namespace through codeusingcode in each and every view that is actually going to use those extension methods is not an option. Thankfully a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma24548476I know how to globally add a namespace so it can be used inside all of viewsa, but I have reasons not to expose my model namespace to them.p  pTaking that into account, I was thinking of moving the extension methods to a different namespace so I can safely expose it to all my views, but now all the controllers that have access to the model namespace will be missing the extensions. I dont want to add this namespace to all my controllers and this time I dont want to make this namespace globally available. I do want the extensions to be usable if just the model namespace is exposed to the code.p  pThe cheap solution would be to add same extension class to two namespaces in other words two cs files with exact same code and be done with it, but I would like to use a better solution if possible.p  pFor a moment I thought I can inherit the extension class in another namespace, but that doesnt work since static classes cannot inherit anything.p  pI also tried using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3805491thisa solution, but it doesnt work at least for extension classes. I mean I exposed the namespace that contained only the extension to the views, but my objects in views did not have access to the extension methods. I also had to add a dummy class to the namespace otherwise the app wouldnt even notice the namespace.p  pstrongTo sum it up, I have an extension class that I need to be available in two different namespaces. Is there some way to achieve this other than copy pasting said class to the other namespacestrongp

Negative 694 pGiven an instance of a Celluloid Actor, you can use codefuturecode to execute an Actor method asynchronously and at some later point in time use the Futures codevaluecode method to obtain the result of the Actor method blocking if necessary.p  pLets say that I have two separate components in a system that both want to use the same Actor method, perhaps a very expensive database query. If both of these components individually called codeactor.future.expensivequerycode, then the query would be executed twice and each caller would get their own separate Future object back to retrieve the results. Furthermore, the two queries would be executed serially, not concurrently. What if, instead, I wanted to have the second call to codeactor.future.expensivequerycode to just get a reference to the Future object created by the first caller Is such a thing possible with Celluloidp

Negative 694 pI am currently modeling some data using a binary logistic regression. The dependent variable has a good number of positive cases and negative cases  it is not sparse. I also have a large training set  100,000 and the number of main effects Im interested in is about 15 so Im not worried about a pn issue. p  pWhat Im concerned about is that many of my predictor variables, if continuous, are zero most of the time, and if nominal, are null most of the time. When these sparse predictor variables take a value  0 or not null, I know because of familiarity with the data that they should be of importance in predicting my positive cases. I have been trying to look for information on how the sparseness of these predictors could be affecting my model.  p  pIn particular, I would not want the effect of a sparse but important variable to be not included in my model if there is another predictor variable that is not sparse and is correlated but actually doesnt do as good a job of predicting the positive cases. To illustrate an example, if I were trying to model whether or not someone ended up being accepted at a particular ivy league university and my three predictors were SAT score, GPA, and donation  1M as a binary, I have reason to believe that donation 1M, when true, is going to be very predictive of acceptance  more so than a high GPA or SAT  but it is also very sparse. How, if at all, is this going to effect my logistic model and do I need to make adjustments for this Also, would another type of model say decision tree, random forest, etc handle this betterp  pThanks, Christie  p

Negative 694 pI have a DLL that consists of some matrix calculations using Eigen. It is supposed to be parallelized with 2 threadsp  precodeompsetnumthreadsn setNbThreadsn codepre  pWell I know this is redundant. Anyway, its sure the parallelization is working as expected because with only one thread n1, each iteration of my processing is taking 7 seconds. When I set n2 threads, each iteration takes 45 seconds.p  pThe issue is that after a while the parallelization stops working with the same buildinputevironment, and it gets back to 7 seconds per iteration. Reinitializing the application doesnt solve the problem. Only solution is rebooting my PC MS Windows 2012.p  pThe problem doesnt affect other OpenMP parallelizations, just Eigen. Am I doing something wrong Did I miss anything in order to initialize Eigen I also tried codeEigenInitParallelcode without success.p  pEDIT. Actually Eigen isnt creating new threads when this issue arises. How is this related to windows and rebooting the systemp

The call stack may consist of a limited amount of address space, often determined at the start of the program. The size of the call stack depends on many factors, including the programming language, machine architecture, multithreading, and amount of available memory. When a program attempts to use more space than is available on the call stack that is, when it attempts to access memory beyond the call stacks bounds, which is essentially a buffer overflow, the stack is said to overflow, typically resulting in a program crash.                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre  pcodeJScodep  precode    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt              function     window.resizefunction      Optional if you want to detect when the window is resized         processBodieswindow.width          function processBodieswidth          ifwidth gt 768              .accordionbody.collapseshow                  else              .accordionbody.collapsehide                   processBodieswindow.width          ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 694 pSo my problem is like this I have 2 different repositories and I need to make a different, new one  containing files from these two. However the repositories share some files main.c for example which I want to merge manually... Ive tried to merge repos with this tutorial a hrefhttpblog.caplin.com20130918mergingtwogitrepositories relnofollowhttpblog.caplin.com20130918mergingtwogitrepositoriesa, however I only get one copy of main.c. Maybe I dont understand how git works Im pretty new to it, but I really need git to give me two files, which then I can manually change and make into a new main.c... I hope Ive made myself clear about my problem... I could just make two different working copies of those repositories, copy the content and make a new repo... But then the history would be lost, rightp

When getting the month of the date. It     keeps giving me an output of code11code.

Negative 694 pTo begin with Im not new to C or C. However, Im currently working with C on Mac Yosemite. Im just trying to write a recursive function to return the common ancestors of two nodes, that are identified by their key data variable. The logic is simple, traverse the tree until both the nodes are in the same branch, the node where these nodes diverge is the common ancestor. With this mind, I came up with the following codep  precodeNode  commonAncestorNode n, int leftelem, int rightelem      if n  NULL  ngtkeyleftelem  ngtkey  rightelemreturn NULL     if leftelem lt ngtkey ampamp rightelem gt ngtkey return n     if leftelem gt ngtkey  rightelem lt ngtkey          coutltltn...Consider changing the order of the elementsltltendl          if leftelem lt ngtkey ampamp rightelem lt ngtkey          commonAncestorngtLeft, leftelem, rightelem          if leftelem gt ngtkey ampamp rightelem gt ngtkey          commonAncestorngtRight, leftelem, rightelem       codepre  pI should work, I have done similar programs. However, the program doesnt compile. Im getting strongcompilerstrong error codecontrol may reach end of nonvoid functioncode This is strange, as I have return statements. Also, to avoid this error I tried adding a return statement at the end, which only returned the root node. Im confused... Should I do something with the XCode settings Is my logic wrongp

Negative 694 pI am trying to build a simple macro, which enable user to select required rows from an excel sheet and export it to a web service.

Negative 694 pI have a site made in php that calls a javascript file to check for site notifications and then send them as a browser notification ie Mozillas Firefox Notifications, Chrome Desktop Notifications, etc.. It works really well, and some users have asked for a chrome notification. I made a basic chrome notification that uses the same code, and it works great for when people arent using the site. However, the problem is when theyre both running at the same time. Users who are on the site and who are using the extension find themselves getting double notifications.p  pIs there a way to make sure that neither ones code runs if the other is activep  pThanksp

Negative 694 pTrying to figure out why my codegetTableSizecode method is returning the wrong result.  What the code below does is simply executes a simple query on a table, and returns the result as a 2D Array.  Thing is, if the query just requests the table without any aggregation then no problem, the coderowCountcode will be correct say 600 rows, but if I ask for some group sums which would compress the rows to 100, for some reason codegetTableSizerscode still returns 600 even after executing the SQL query.p  precodepublic String[][] getQueryConnection db, String sql           String[][] s  new String[3][1]     System.out.printlnExecuting sql     try          Statement stmt  db.createStatementResultSet.TYPESCROLLSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCURUPDATABLE          ResultSet rs  stmt.executeQuerysql         ResultSetMetaData rsmd  rs.getMetaData          int colsCount  rsmd.getColumnCount          int rowsCount  getTableSizers          System.out.printlnRows rowsCount         System.out.printlnCols colsCount          s  new String[rowsCount][colsCount]         rs.beforeFirst           forint rows  0 rowsltrowsCount rows          int rows  0          whilers.next              rows             System.out.printlnRow rows             forint cols0 colsltcolsCount cols                  s[rows][cols]  nullFixrs.getStringcols1                 System.out.printlnCol cols s[rows][cols] ...                             catch SQLException e           TODO Autogenerated catch block         e.printStackTrace          System.out.printlndone..     return s   public int getTableSizeResultSet r      int size  0     try          r.last         size  r.getRow      catch Exception ex          return 0          return size  codepre  pEdit  Note that I get an codeInvalid Cursor Statecode SQLException.

I find global working easier since most of them are functions. Its all working fine to this point.p  pBut now the issue that I am having. Im loading 3 js files in my main.js file. I am requiring the first js file, I call the function that is in that js file and store the result in a variable. Thats going fine.

Negative 694 pIn the Rails API documentation, here what is said about streaming templates.p  blockquote   pstrongWhen to use streamingstrongp      pStreaming may be considered to be overkill for lightweight actions   like new or edit. The real benefit of streaming is on expensive   actions that, for example, do a lot of queries on the database.p      pIn such actions, you want to delay queries execution as much as you   can. For example, imagine the following dashboard actionp  precodedef dashboard   posts  Post.all   pages  Page.all   articles  Article.all end codepre      pMost of the queries here are happening in the controller. In order to   benefit from streaming you would want to rewrite it asp  precodedef dashboard    Allow lazy execution of the queries   posts  Post.all   pages  Page.all   articles  Article.all   render stream true end  codepre      pNotice that stream only works with templates. Rendering json or xml with stream wont work.p blockquote  pThe thing that I do not understand is, how does using codestream truecode option, will make the queries go through a lazy execution The queries here are called before the render method, so how all this worksp

Negative 694 pThe FAQs for uirouter says thisp  blockquote   pWith 492 merged v0.2.8, you can now register states in any order and across modules. You can register children before the parent state exists. It will queue them up and once the parent state is registered then the child will be registered. Note You still need to manage module dependencies.p blockquote  precodeangular.modulemain, [main.page1].configfunctionstateProvider      stateProvider.statemain, ...   angular.modulemain.page1, [].configfunctionstateProvider      stateProvider.statemain.page1, ...  codepre  pThe quoted text does not explicitly state that the naming of the modules is significant to the success of the routing states configuration. It seems to say that no matter where your routing states are defined, as long as the modules are all considered properly dependent then all the configured states will be registered, put in order, and become operational.p  pHowever, in the example that follows immediately after that text above, the naming of the related modules follows the naming of the routes precisely. This is also true in the following example which is included in the uirouter repo that can be downloaded from github.p  precodeangular.moduleuiRouterSample, [   uiRouterSample.contacts,   uiRouterSample.contacts.service,   uiRouterSample.utils.service,   ui.router,    ngAnimate ]  angular.moduleuiRouterSample.contacts, [   ui.router ] codepre  pI was under the impression that managing module dependencies required creating a tree of dependent modules that were referenced by their named list of requested dependencies to be injected. However, the implication of the examples is that at least uirouter depends on a module naming hierarchy as well as a state naming hierarchy. p  pAnd in fact, Im having trouble navigating between states configured in the config functions of different modules. So if there is some guidance about managing module dependencies that will make the promise true that now you can register states in any order and from any module, then I would like to be let in on the secret.p  pIf the naming is not significant, then could someone make explicit just exactly which direction the dependencies in the modules have to point in order for uirouter states to see their substates p  pIn the dependencies among the modules themselves, the mostshared dependencies are near the root, because the branching that occurs as we travel toward the leaves limits crossbranch dependencies because of the likelihood of circular referencing. So Im expecting to hear that uirouter also sees states that are farther from the root as child states, and that they have to be siblings in case we want to traverse in any direction but up and down, from parent to children p  pBut again, my question is about the naming hierarchy must the state hierarchy and the module hierarchy be identically named unlikely, or must the dependency hierarchy for states and modules be semantically identical, or, more likely, must they be traversable identically Or does Angular throw everything into a big pot and let the components just dig inp  pThanks,p
Negative 694 pI have an application which is drawing image data line by line as it comes in from the network. I want to show this updating process instead of just the final image.p  pMy original code to draw this looks like the followingp  precode dispatchsyncdispatchgetmainqueue,void         for int i0iltlen i  i3                      float r  1.0byteData[i]256             float g  1.0byteData[i1]256             float b  1.0byteData[i2]256              CGContextSetRGBFillColormyViewgtbitmapContext, r,g,b, 1.0f              CGContextFillRect gmyViewgtbitmapContext, CGRectMakey, x, 1.0f, 1.0f                           x               codepre  pThis works fine but I discovered that removing dispatchsync makes the performance much better from around 100200ms to a small fraction of that. However without this call things will crash quickly due to some race condition, which is reasonable since I think the UI should always be updated from the main thread.p  pIn order to improve the performance and keep things proper my strategy is to create a temporary bitmap context, write the entire line to that, and then safely write that bitmap to my main one at the end of the process.p  pThe code looks like thisp  precode        CGContextRef context  [myView createCustomBitmapContextWithSize CGSizeMake1024.0f, 1.0f]            for int i0iltlen i  i3                      float r  1.0byteData[i]256             float g  1.0byteData[i1]256             float b  1.0byteData[i2]256              CGContextSetRGBFillColorcontext, r,g,b, 1.0f              CGContextFillRect context, CGRectMakey, 0, 1.0f, 1.0f                 x                   dispatchsyncdispatchgetmainqueue,void             CGImageRef image  CGBitmapContextCreateImagecontext             CGContextDrawImagemyViewgtbitmapContext, CGRectMake0,x,1024.0f,1.0f, image          codepre  pThe first problem with this is that it doesnt render at all, so I am probably using the APIs incorrectly. But I checked that the call to CGBitmapContextCreateImage near the end takes around 100ms just by itself, so even if I get it to render this will not help performance much.p  pCan someone please help me understand a more appropriate way to do this updating processp  pI think the way I am actually drawing to the screen may be relevant, so Ill show my drawRect function as well.p  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect       CGContextRef context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext       CGImageRef myImage  CGBitmapContextCreateImagebitmapContext       CGContextDrawImagecontext, rect, myImage       CGImageReleasemyImage    codepre

Negative 694 pIm attempting to create a Core Graphics pattern in iOS based on user input. I dont have much experience with drawing and am stuck on where to begin. The pattern will be a rows and columns of squares. At some point the color of the squares will change, likely midrow, based on what the pattern is counting for the user.p  pFor now, Im simply trying to draw the basic pattern, and will work into the customization later. The views frame and bounds are set using a storyboard. My initial thought was to draw the squares with a loop. For example, if I wanted to draw a 52x80 grid of 3x3 squares offset by 1, I could do the followingp  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect       CGRect square  CGRectMake0,0,3,3      UIBezierPath path  [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRectsquare]     [[UIColor redColor] setStroke]     [[UIColor redColor] setFill]      for int i  0 ilt52 i4        for int i  j jlt80 j4          [path moveToPointCGPointMakei, j]         [path fill]              codepre  pObviously, this doesnt work.

Negative 694 pI dont get why my query to my Firebase database doesnt work. Im new to this and decided to follow a simple tutorial to read data. Writing a JSON object worked, was very happy to see that. Reading on the other hand starts to piss me off. The only thing that I wanted to do was read 1 record where the Email address was equal to some Email address. These are, and should be, unique in a user database. Once I retrieved the user, I could the use his UID, the automatically generated value on push, to do other things.

Im kinda forced to use this last one besides the fact that I see noSQL databases more useful, and powerful, when we have precomputed data, data that could be stored in a relational database but always needs to go trough the same joins in one way. Having these results calculated joined once and the results written to a noSQL database, makes lookups way faster by reducing unnecessary load and grouping together commonly requested datasets. Please also correct my vision if Im wrong on this.p

Negative 694 pI have been piecing together a model for the best part of today using ContentTypeGeneric Foreign Key as, from my Googling, it seemed to be the solution I was looking for. However, now that I have something rendering, it doesnt seem to be the case. p  pAll I want is a foreign key dropdown that allows the user to select a record from One of Two models. With a GenericForeignKey it lists the models specified in my limit statement but then expects the user to know the IDPK and enter it in the objectid field. Is this correctp  pI am now thinking a query to get all records from both models and list them in a dropdown would be a much cleaner solution. If so, would I just achieve this in forms.pyp  pThe foreign key element isnt too important as I only need to be able to importmanipulate some fields from the Two associated models and save them to the new model. p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 694 pI am documenting this as it happens and Im not sure quite why, but It seems that generating a controller will generate it with the Ctrl appended at the end of the name instead of the required Controller which causes it not to work at all. This is a problem with the generatorangularfullstack as far as I can tell so far, but I am really unsure why it does this.p  pSo example p  pYou want to generate a controller withp  precodeyo angularfullstackcontroller user codepre  pThis generates a controller with the name userCtrl.p  pWhich as far as I thought isnt even a convention for Angular unless you give it a nickname in the html. If anyone has any ideas why it is doing it this way please explain. I will send this to their issues on github if anyone can verify.p  pReplicating the issue The way that I came about this was by simply generating a controller as seen above and then referencing something from the scope in html. It wont populate and simply pops out the  message  in the html. Then I copy and paste exact code from the angular site using the proper Controller appended name and everything works fine.p

We include the whole          AuthenticationManager here in the userConfigContext.xml so that you can see the things you will          need to change in context.         gt     ltbean idauthenticationManager         classorg.jasig.cas.authentication.AuthenticationManagerImplgt          lt Uncomment the metadata populator to allow clearpass to capture and cache the password              This switch effectively will turn on clearpass.         ltproperty nameauthenticationMetaDataPopulatorsgt            ltlistgt               ltbean classorg.jasig.cas.extension.clearpass.CacheCredentialsMetaDataPopulatorgt                  ltconstructorarg index0 refcredentialsCache gt               ltbeangt            ltlistgt         ltpropertygt          gt          lt remember me gt         ltproperty nameauthenticationMetaDataPopulatorsgt             ltlistgt                 ltbean classorg.jasig.cas.authentication.principal.RememberMeAuthenticationMetaDataPopulator gt             ltlistgt         ltpropertygt          lt              This is the List of CredentialToPrincipalResolvers that identify what Principal is trying to authenticate.              The AuthenticationManagerImpl considers them in order, finding a CredentialToPrincipalResolver which               supports the presented credentials.                           AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers for two purposes.  First, it uses them to identify the Principal              attempting to authenticate to CAS login .  In the default configuration, it is the DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver              that fills this role.  If you are using some other kind of credentials than UsernamePasswordCredentials, you will need to replace              DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver with a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the credentials you are              using.                           Second, AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers to identify a service requesting a proxy granting ticket.               In the default configuration, it is the HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver that serves this purpose.               You will need to change this list if you are identifying services by something more or other than their callback URL.             gt         ltproperty namecredentialsToPrincipalResolversgt             ltlistgt                 lt                      UsernamePasswordCredentialsToPrincipalResolver supports the UsernamePasswordCredentials that we use for login                       by default and produces SimplePrincipal instances conveying the username from the credentials.                                            If youve changed your LoginFormAction to use credentials other than UsernamePasswordCredentials then you will also                      need to change this bean declaration or add additional declarations to declare a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the                      Credentials you are using.                     gt                 ltbean classorg.jasig.cas.authentication.principal.UsernamePasswordCredentialsToPrincipalResolver gt                     ltproperty nameattributeRepository refattributeRepository gt                 ltbeangt                  lt                      HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver supports HttpBasedCredentials.  It supports the CAS 2.0 approach of                      authenticating services by SSL callback, extracting the callback URL from the Credentials and representing it as a                      SimpleService identified by that callback URL.                                           If you are representing services by something more or other than an HTTPS URL whereat they are able to                      receive a proxy callback, you will need to change this bean declaration or add additional declarations.                     gt                 ltbean                     classorg.jasig.cas.authentication.principal.HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver gt             ltlistgt         ltpropertygt          lt              Whereas CredentialsToPrincipalResolvers identify who it is some Credentials might authenticate,               AuthenticationHandlers actually authenticate credentials.  Here we declare the AuthenticationHandlers that              authenticate the Principals that the CredentialsToPrincipalResolvers identified.  CAS will try these handlers in turn              until it finds one that both supports the Credentials presented and succeeds in authenticating.             gt         ltproperty nameauthenticationHandlersgt             ltlistgt                 lt                      This is the authentication handler that authenticates services by means of callback via SSL, thereby validating                      a server side SSL certificate.                     gt                 lt                      This is the authentication handler declaration that every CAS deployer will need to change before deploying CAS                       into production.  The default SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticationHandler authenticates UsernamePasswordCredentials                      where the username equals the password.  You will need to replace this with an AuthenticationHandler that implements your                      local authentication strategy.  You might accomplish this by coding a new such handler and declaring                      edu.someschool.its.cas.MySpecialHandler here, or you might use one of the handlers provided in the adaptors modules.                     gt                     ltbean classmy.project.cas.authentication.handler.CnsAuthHandler gt                     lt lppegt                     ltref beanlppeEnabledLdapAuthenticationHandler gt             ltlistgt         ltpropertygt     ltbeangt      lt datasource di connessione a db mysql gt     lt context di connessione a ldapgt     lt     This bean defines the security roles for the Services Management application.

Negative 694 pI would like to understand whats going on here. Obviously, theres some aspect of references or assignment operators that I am not getting right.p  pstrongObjectivestrong Within a function, I want to work with 2 local reference variables to various elements of the same list one is the iterated over and one is a marker that changes when certain conditions are met. Both are initially referencing the same element. Im not modifying the strings in the list in the actual code, the list is a parameter passed by reference.p  pstrongProblemstrong as soon as a change the second reference to another element, the first reference now points to that new element as well. The references stay in sync, but I expected them to be independent.p  pstrongMy interpretationstrong iterator is a pointer to a string that is contained in the list. In codestring amp ref1  itcode, I am dereferencing iterator pointer to get the string address whether that itself is a pointer shouldnt really matter IMO so that coderef1code and coderef2code are aliases to the address of string a. So in my mind, changing ref2 so it points to another string does not change the address of anything, but just the value of ref2 should now point or alias to string b, while ref1 should still points to a.p  pChanging the code to use pointers instead of references works perfectly, so it seems I am incorrectly treating reference variables as pointers, or theres something behind the scenes overloaded assignment operators Im not thinking of.p  precodelistltstringgt l     string s1  a    string s2  b     l.pushbacks1     l.pushbacks2     listltstringgtiterator it  l.begin     string amp ref1  it     string amp ref2  it     it     After this line, both ref1 ampamp ref2 evaluates to a ref2  it  After this line, both ref1 ampamp ref2 evaluates to b ifref1  ref2       cout ltlt woot ltlt endl      codepre

Negative 694 pMy question, how can I properly remove a realm file Currently Im doing so using the file manager, which is fine for me since the Realm file is mostly here for offline caching.p  pMy app logs in to a webplatform, and creates a realm for this platform so you can log in to multiple. When you remove it with the filemanager however, there can still be lock files and such so I guess this dirty way of removing is the wrong wayp  pin Android you have the deleteRealmFile call on the RealmClass, which works fine when all references are closed. It seems there is not much security on iOS as I can just remove it like this.p  pSo what is the proper way of handling thisp  pIm not sure if realm is intended to be used like this but its ideal for us and makes the developers happy. p  pIm working in swift and have an iOS7 requirement.p

Negative 694 pI am looking for an alternative solution to using Sumproduct  Sumif  Sumifs basically, array formulas when it comes to the example provided below. I have scoured Stackoverflow and I am coming up woefully empty. I am open to anyandall suggestions to achieve better performance that do not involve changing out of Excel because that is the medium I have been ordered to do this in. Thank you in advanced for your timep  pMy problem is thus I have an excel workbook that takes 4090 seconds to calculate, depending on PC specs. I have narrowed the calculation problems to a series of array calculations. When these array calculations are removed, my workbook takes 3 seconds to fully recalculate... so yes I am sure these are the bottleneck.p  pMy array calculations are like so I have a list of zone names eg North America, Western Europe, etc... on Sheet 1, row 2, extending to column HJ. I have a list of values on Sheet 2 rows 2500, also extending to column HJ. I need to aggregatesumup all of the values on Sheet 2, based on the zone names on Sheet 1. The columns are in a direct 1to1 relationship, so the following formulae all work and create the exact same valuesp  precodeSUMPRODUCTSheet2A2Sheet2HJ2, Sheet1A2Sheet1HJ2  North America SUMIFSheet1A2Sheet1HJ2, North America, Sheet2A2Sheet2HJ2  SUMIFSSheet2A2Sheet2HJ2, Sheet1A2Sheet1HJ2, North America codepre  pThe performance of doing these array calculations is unacceptable to the powers that be. I am fairly certain that my response should be tough noogies, but I must do my due diligence on finding an alternative.p  pSo am I doing anything wrong with these array calculations Can I restructure them somehow I am fine with helper rows, UDFs, etc...p  pThanks againp
Negative 694 pIll keep it short and simple, Ive browsed and browsed around here and other sites but am unable to find a solution for my issue Ive got an HTML form that works fine.

Negative 694 pIm working on a simple restaurant POS system, and I had a problem suddenly come up. This problem has only occurred when I run it on a Genymotion tablet device. I do not have this problem on smaller genymotion devices or the 2 physical devices Ive tried.p  pOne of my activities uses 5 RecyclerViews to display the menu and sales summary. Every few item clicks, the RecyclerViews decide to just not update and do not properly display my items unless I scroll a bit on ANY of the RecyclerViews or click something.

The RecyclerView responsible for showing the menu items still shows seafood. If I click on anything, the correct chicken item gets selected and everything refreshes to what should show up.

Then I release my lock with this LUA scriptp  precodeif redis.callget,KEYS[1]  ARGV[1] then     return redis.calldel,KEYS[1] else     return 0 end codepre  pI will be processing these actions constantly.p  pHowever, every 5 minutes I want to loop through all of the existing different lockvalues of which there is a large number and insert each of the lockvalues into a database. This wont be as fast as ordinary redis operations. How do I do this looping part separate from the lockinsert datadrop lock part. Should it be in a separate processp  pI think I want two processes or two redis servers. One to set the lock, increment data, drop lock over and over. The other to periodically scan the lockvalues and dump it into the database, without being blocked by the LUA script. For each lockvalue, its not crucial if some values arent completely uptodate with the first loop, so long as the next loop 5 minute later picks up any increments that are missed.p  pIs this possiblep

Negative 694 pI am confronted with a challenging situation.  The project I am working on has two git branches master and develop.  I have been working on a number of issues on the develop branch.  All commits have been made directly on the develop branch separate branches are not used for different issues.  Commits for a particular issue can be identified by the commit message, as each commit message starts with the issue id e.g. all commit messages for issue 231 will begin with 231.p  pAfter testing locally, the changes for these various issues have be deployed to the owners emUser Acceptance Testingem UAT server.  Since the project has no stagingtesting branch, the develop branch has been merged into master and pulled into the master branch on UAT.  As a result the master branch on UAT contains all the latest changes from develop branch.  Further more this puts the master branch on UAT ahead of the Master branch on the production PROD server.p  pThe site owner has now said that he would like to deploy all the changes for one of the issues e.g. 231 onto PROD separately before deloying the rest. p  pThe question I have is how best to achieve thisp  pThe method I thought of was to create a new branch on PROD based on the current master branch on PROD e.g. codegit branch master231code.  I could then pull this down to my local environment and cherrypick the 231 commits into it.  Once this is done I could pull the changes to master231 back into PROD.  Hopefully that would address the issue of deploying issue 231 changes to PROD.p  pIn terms of bringing in the other changes on UAT server, I could log into PROD and checkout master branch remembering we are currently on master231.  I can then pull the latest master changes into PROD.  That would mean the master branches on UAT and PROD now match.  p  pGiven that master branch already contains the same commits as those in master231 branch remember that all issue 231 commits were originally on master, do I still need to merge master231 into master on PROD And if I did, would I get merge conflictsp  pI reaslize there are several questions in there but I would love to get some feedback on this overall approach. p

Negative 694 pI am having trouble wrapping my head around how Razor syntax works.p  pIt is my understanding that it will allow you to embed serverside code directly into the page, but it keeps all of that from the client even though the client can interact with it.p  pIm used to ASP.net web views and things of that nature  does the Razor syntax essentially do postbacks and all of the code is contained within the page, or is the way that the client interacts with the serverside code fundamentally differentp  pIf this is too openended, please leave me comments as to how to focus the question more.

Negative 694 pIm trying to implement a mouse click event for an image basically a tile on a map on a JPanel. Im just not able to figure out how to go about it. I have a Main class that extends JPanel. Im retrieving tiles from a tile server and displaying them in the paintComponent method of the Main class based on the specific zoom level. I use tiny locator images to represent a specific monument or a building in a city in the same paintComponent method. They are placed on top of these tiles based on corresponding latitude and longitude. p  pWhen I click on these locator images, I must be able to add an event MouseClick to the locator image. Now what Ive read so far is we cannot add an event handler to images. It can only be added to native components of swing. How do I go about adding the events to the tiny locator images when I have not represented it using JLabel or even surrounding the image say with a rectanglep

Negative 694 pIm working through the C Primer 5th Edition, and while its been really great material so far, I find in some instances I run into headscratching explanations that give me more questions than answers. p  pIn the current example emphasis mine on the boldedp  blockquote   pUnlike other functions, inline and constexpr functions strongmay be defined multiple times in the program.strong After all, the compiler needs the definition, not just the declaration, in order to expand the code. However, strongall of the definitions of a given inline or constexpr must match exactlystrong. As a result, inline and constexpr functions normally are defined in headers.p blockquote  pIve done a bit of research on this, and Ive seen many answers that Im able to define an inline function multiple times strongas long as the definition is identical.strong Additionally, Ive seen that the standard allows for this. What Im curious is emwhyem p  pIs there a feasible coding situation where I would have my include for a given header file for an inline function I want, only to provide a duplicate definition in my .cpp file I feel like Im missing an obvious situation where this rule is applicable. Why not just make it so you could only define the inline function once in the header, period, and not worry about it afterwardsp  pAll the best.p
Negative 694 pIve scoured the site and cant find the answer I need for this problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pIm trying to create a formula that checks whether a particular text string is present in a range, but also if the cell adjacent to that text string match is a Y or N for whether approved,yes or no. If that text string is found, but the corresponding rating is a N, thats the same as it not being there at all for me, so it would result in a NO. p  pThis is what I have right now IFANDMATCHB2,RngF,00,INDEXRngG,MATCHB2,RngF,0Y,YES,NOp  pB2 contains the relavent textp  pRngF is the column with many rows of text, included that in B2.p  pRngG contains Y or N for each item in RngF.p  pRight now this formula works, except for one problem. If the text in B2 is found in RngF and there is a corresponding Y in RngG, it only returns the first instance of this. So if the first row has B2 and a N, but the second row has B2 and a Y, it will still give me a No because the first thing it found was the N. I need it to look past this and tell me if it finds ANY instances of B2 with a Y, not just the first. p  pDoes it maybe have to do with my exact match selection the 1,0,1 p  pI would post a pic but I dont have enough rep. I hope this makes sense. p  pAlso, if there is an alternative way you think this could be done, a different type of formula altogether, I am welcome to that feedback as well. Thanks,p

Negative 694 pIve just added a new device to the provisioning portal. Previously the next step would then be to manually update the relevant profiles to add this new device, however it seems this is now handled automatically by Xcode and its no longer possible to edit the profiles via the provisioning portal to include the new device. There is no longer an edit button in the portal.p  pOk, however the latest version of Xcode Xcode 7 GM Seed no longer has a refresh button to update the profiles so how are you now supposed to refreshupdate profiles when a new device gets added to include that new device in the profilep

VS2015 provides me with a hrefhttplocalhost7071 relnofollowhttplocalhost7071a as the target to use, but you cant use localhost on an AVD as the AVD thinks youre targeting it and youll receive access denied.

Either its access denied or host cannot be found.p  plocalhost7071 definitely is live though as I can get an access denied page in Chrome, so thats a valid response.p  pHow do you set this up so that it will workp

Negative 694 pI have an ASP.net MVC application that Ive developed using Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise that is not behaving nicely in IE8, and as much as Id like to just declare IE8 as unsupported, this is unfeasible from a business perspective at the moment. p  pSo, to test in IE8, I downloaded a VirtualBox containing an instance of windows with IE8 from a hrefhttpsdev.modern.ietoolsvmswindows relnofollowherea. p  pIve been successful in using this instance of IE8 to connect my organizations dev server which is running Windows Server 2012r2, IIS 8.5.9600, so Ive been able to reproduce the issue. Id really like to be able to step through whats happening in the debugger, though. p  pSo, I believe I have two options.p  ol listrongConnect to the IIS instance on our dev server using Visual Studios remote debugging feature.strongbr This is kind of intimidating to me to attempt, because there seem to be a lot of options and Im unsure how to proceed. It would be nice to be able to figure this out, though, as being able to do remote debugging on the dev server would be very helpful for future development. I tried using the default transport and putting the host for the dev sever in the qualifier box in VS, but it just told me the debugger service wasnt running on the remote machine, even though Im fairly certain it is. li listrongConnect to my local workstation running Visual Studio from virtualboxstrongbr This seems like it would be the simplest solution, but I cant figure it out. I tried a few different network modes from virtualbox  NAT, bridged, and HostOnly, but I could never get the page to load in IE inside the virtualbox. I tried using the ip of my workstation as reported by ipconfig all the IP of the normal network adapter for bridged and NAT mode, and the IP of the Host Only special adapter in Host Only mode and the port VS was configured to use. No dice.li ol  pAny ideas on how I can move forward with either of these options Or some third, better optionp
