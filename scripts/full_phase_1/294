Positive 294 pThe alternative is to use a daemon to manage and hand out those IP addresses. Trying to get DHCP daemon software to serve out IP addresses in 127.0.0.08 is weird and doesnt seem to work well for me and the alternative is to write my own DHCP like daemon but for localhost. Also, a daemon has troubles with staleness unlike with the OS which knows when applications unexpectedly exit.p  pAlso, I cant use the trick of codeconnectcodeing to a broadcast address to autobind to an address because that doesnt allow me to select the port.p

I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I dont include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads one per array average, overkill but its definitely the fastest.p  pThe sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk not memoryp  pI realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesnt matter to me since this is read only data.p  pThe Postgres query doesnt change timing on subsequent runs.p  pIve rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But Im guessing that Pythons file handling code is pretty much in C though maybe not the csv lib so this indicates to me that Postgres isnt streaming from the disk either or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layerp

Negative 294 pIm looking for an elegant way to denote undefined values in situations where formatted numbers usually render. Ill work up a small example. For starters, you of course cant use thisp  precodeusrbinperl use strict use warnings for my s 1, 1.2, undef, 1.3      printf 5.2fn, s  codepre  p...because the use warnings nails you with Use of uninitialized value... on the third iteration.

What I really want is something like thisp  precodeusrbinperl use strict use warnings for my s 1, 1.2, undef, 1.3      printf 5.2fn, sq  codepre  p...but I cant because this generates the Argument  isnt numeric... problem on the third value.p  pThis brings me to the doorstep of my question.

Negative 294 pI am interested in your opinions on unittesting code that uses Corba to communicate with a server.p  pWould you mock the Corba objects In Python thats sort of a pain in the ass because all the methods of Corba objects are loaded dynamically. So youre basically stuck with mock anything.p  pThanksp  pNote I believe I have not made myself clear enough, so Ill try to give a somewhat more concrete examplep  pA web application needs to display a page containing data received from the server. It obtains the data by calling serverpagetable.getData and then formats the data, converts them to the correct python types because Corba does not have e.g. a date type etc. and finally creates the HTML code to be displayed.p  pAnd this is what I would like to test  the methods that receive the data and do all the transformations and finally create the HTML code.p  pI believe the most straightforward decision is to mock the Corba objects as they essentially comprise both the networking and db functionality which ought not to be tested in unit tests. p  pIts just that this is quite a lot of extra work to do  mocking all the Corba objects there is a User object, a server session object, the pagetable object, an admin object etc.. Maybe its just because Im stuck with Corba and therefore I have to reflect the object hierarchy dictated by the server with mocks. On the other hand, it could be that there is some cool elegant solution to testing code using Corba that just did not cross my mind.p

Negative 294 pWe use axis2 for building our webservices and a Jboss server to run the logic of all of our applications.

Negative 294 pI have an issue where users on my web site have recently begun to receive the error message p  pCant connect to local MySQL server through socket varlibmysqlmysql.sock 2p  pI know that the connection strings in the code are correct, as users are able to query the database view pages that retrieve info from and submit usergenerated info to the database.

If it is in fact too many connections, whats the best approach to deal with itp  pAnd are there any other possible causes that Im not yet considering Basically, theres no predictable way to determine whether or not a users data will be submitted or whether an error will be returned, which is disconcerting from the users perspective, to say the least.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1005485warningmysqlconnectcantconnecttolocalmysqlserverThis questiona is closest to my problem but does not provide a solution to fix my specific issue, hence my posting a new question.p  pThanks in advance for the ideas.p

Negative 294 pIf youre in my position you have a big WebForms applications which have escalated to this unmaintainable thing. Things break when you add new features and you need an inexpensive maintainable way to do some kind of automated testing.p  pNow, from my understanding, the right thing to do would be to try building an abstraction layout of the page and user control model present in ASP.NET WebForms however, seeing as it would require a major investment in an existing application it is not an option.p  pIm trying and pushing for a RESTlike development as much as possible because it has some nice properties. And while doing this Ive written a simple spider bot that crawls all URLs it can find and tries, simply getting them. This allowed my to quickly find bad data that was causing problems and avoid having my endusers clicking on broken things, however, this is of course not enough.p  pI continued work on my crawler and its developed into a simple REST client that tries different input combination, looking for a probable bug or crash. Its more intelligent that just an exhaustive search because it knows about the ASP.NET WebForms application layer and my goal here is to basically explore the state of the web application, hoping to hit all the corner cases before our users.p  pDoes anyone have any experience doing something similarp  pAlso, for you test gurus out there. Is this a complete waste of time, or will I be able to actually say something about the quality here From my perspective it seems to hit a sweet spot in that it will try things a potential end user would though a browser.p  pAs I said before, were stuck in a bad place.

Negative 294 pPlease, take a look at my code bellow. This part pops top view controller usually, the same codeArticleControllerControllercode from the stack I found that the problem stays the same no matter if I pop single controller or pop to the root controller, creates new one and adds to the stack.p  pThe problem is, that its retain count never goes to zero and so codedealloccode method of codeArticleControllerControllercode is never called leaving large amounts of various interface objects unreleased. Eventually app crashes at least in device and at least I think this part is the main problem because of low memory.p  precode void navigateToNewsCategoryByIndexintidx      [app.nav popViewControllerAnimatedNO]  could be popToRootController     ArticleControllerController ac  [[ArticleControllerController alloc] init]     ac.categoryIndex  idx     [app.nav pushViewControllerac animatedNO]     [ac release]     NSLogAC retain count d, [ac retainCount]  prints 2   codepre  pSo, I guess, popViewControllerAnimated releases only one of the remaining two retains. Why What should I look for What can I do Call code[ac release]code two times that would be terrible thingp
Negative 294 p[start EDIT]p  pYes, you can. See Michael Carman answer.p  pThe initial question title  codeIs it possible to use a test like TestMorecmpok  but that accepts  smart match operator with not a scalar at the expected argumentcode was idiotic and with the help of brian d foy it has become the current one. You can skip the rest of the question and go for the answers that are also about comparing deep structures.p  pThe origin of this question was my belief that  does not work with array or hashes refs like keys for hashes as I was so get use to see  never used with references and the docs always mention  and . I got so obfuscated with that, that I made the newbie error of passing an array to a function intending to be a single argument  codecmpokknownvalu, , returned, testing method abccode. My problem here was not cmpok but a better understanding of the smart match operator. The question is rubbish but you can learn good things from the answers.p  p[end EDIT]p  pI know that probably this is a XY question, so helping me to put the right question or need and the hint for the solution would also be appreciated.p  pThe casep  pI am testing the return of a function that produces an array. The return could be different depending of the environment but always it would have at least one constant value the one that I want to test. I want to use a test like codeiscode not the codeokcode in order to have better test info. As I am using Perl 5.12 and the smart match operator to find if the element is in the array, I can usep  precodeokknownvalue  returned, testing method abc codepre  pBut I like the enhanced output of codeiscode or codelikecode with the found and expected part. So I tried the code that seemed more natural to mep  precodecmpokknownvalu, , returned, testing method abc codepre  pBut it does not work because, seems that cmpok expects a scalar in both parts of the comparisons.  p  precodenot ok 1  testing method abc    Failed test testing method abc    at abc.t line 53.      stablevalue                2 codepre  pThe array in the expected slot is evaluated in scalar context and converted to 2.p  pThis makes sense because if it fails the expected part can not be codeprintcodeed but should be codeprint Dumpercode and probably this is not in the logic of this method.p  pI can solve it with a hack using codelikecode and stringifying the array, but having a test where you can use the smart match operator as a comparison method like codewhencode would be nice. Does someone know if TestMore can do it or any other Test packagep  pAt the moment I am usingp  precodeokknownvalue  returned, testing method abc   or diag        ERRORn.       Found .

Negative 294 pWhenever I look deeply enough into reflector I bump into codeexterncode methods with no source.  I read the msdn documentation at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarye59b22c5vvs.80.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarye59b22c5vvs.80.aspxa.  What I got from that article is that methods with the codeexterncode modifier have to be injected.  I interpreted this to mean it works something like an abstract factory pattern.  I also noticed that Ive never seen a nonstatic extern method.  Is static declaration a requirement I could see how this would make sense   Im still guessing here and Im not sure how it actually works.  It seems to me like the compiler must recognize certain attributes that mitigate processing, but I dont know what the attributes are other than ones Ive come across like codeMethodImplAttributecode and codeDllImportAttributecode from the MSDN example.  How does someone leverage the codeexterncode attribute  It said that in many instances this can increase performance.  Also, how would I go about looking into the source of codeexterncode methods like codeObject.InternalGetEqualscode p

So my question is this How do you setup Nokia Apps development and which platform to use C, Java, QT, QMLp  pMy guess is that once this is done you just copy the .SIS or .SISX file to your phone and it should work there. p
Negative 294 pi have a php script where i want to display some images inside a div, but there are some restrictions regarding the max width and height.br For example, an image may have width1000px and height600px, but the max width and hight of the image should not be over 500 px in order to fit in the div.br So, i want to convert the dimensions so that the image fits in the div but the ratio between width and height remains the same.  p  pExample image dimensions 1000x600, maxwidth  500, maxheight  400. The result of the dimension shouldnt be 500x400 but 500x300.p  pIve wrote a piece of code that seems to be working, but it doesnt seem to be working well in terms of performance when there are lots of images, as it does something like reducing the size by 10 stepbystep until the result is in the accepted limit.  p  pAny ideas Thank you in advance.p

Negative 294 pI thought I could just throw this out there and just ask I have seen Delphi controls that are flawless in terms of graphical effects. Meaning no flickering, sectioned updates only redraw the section of a control that is marked as dirty and smooth scrolling.p  pI have coded a lot of graphical controls over the years, so I know about double buffering, dibs, bitblts and all the common stuff I always use dibs to draw everything if possible, but there is an overhead. Also know about InvalidateRect and checking TCanvas.ClipRect for the actual rect that needs to be updated. Despite all these typical solutions, I find it very difficult to create the same quality components as say  Developer Express or Razed Components. If the graphics is smooth you can bet the scrollbars native flicker, and if the scrollbars and frame is smooth you can swear the background flickers during scrolling. p  pIs there a standard setup of code to handle this A sort of best practises that ensures smooth redraws of the entire control  including the nonclient area of a controlp  pFor instance, here is a bare bone control which take height for segmented updates only redraw what is needed. If you create it on a form, try moving a window over it, and watch it replace the parts with colors see paint method.p  pDoes anyone have a similar base class that can handle non client area redraws without flickeringp  precodetype  TMyControl  ClassTCustomControl private    TWinControl Erase background prior to clientarea paint    procedure WMEraseBkgndvar Message TWmEraseBkgndmessage WMERASEBKGND Protected    TCustomControl Overrides clientarea paint mechanism    Procedure PaintOverride     TWinControl Adjust Win32 parameters for CreateWindow    procedure CreateParamsvar Params TCreateParamsoverride public   Constructor CreateAOwnerTComponentoverride End    TMyControl   Constructor TMyControl.CreateAOwnerTComponent Begin   inherited CreateAowner   ControlStyleControlStyle  [csOpaque] end  procedure TMyControl.CreateParamsvar Params TCreateParams begin   inherited CreateParamsParams     When a window has this style set, any areas that its      child windows occupy are excluded from the update region.    params.ExStyleparams.ExStyle  WSCLIPCHILDREN     Exclude VREDRAW amp HREDRAW    with Params.WindowClass do   Begin      When a window class has either of these two styles set,        the window contents will be completely redrawn every time it is        resized either vertically or horizontally or both      stylestyle  CSVREDRAW     stylestyle  CSHREDRAW   end end  procedure TMyControl.Paint     Inline proc check if a rectangle is empty    function isEmptyRectconst aRectTRectBoolean   Begin     resultarect.RightaRect.Left and aRect.BottomaRect.Top   end     Inline proc Compare two rectangles    function isSameRectconst aFirstRectTRectconst aSecondRectTRectBoolean   Begin     resultsysutils.CompareMemaFirstRect,aSecondRect,SizeOfTRect   end     Inline proc This fills the background completely    Procedure FullRepaint   var     mRectTRect   Begin     mRectgetClientRect     AdjustClientRectmRect     Canvas.Brush.ColorclWhite     Canvas.Brush.StylebsSolid     Canvas.FillRectmRect   end  begin    A full redraw is only issed if       1. the cliprect is empty       2. the cliprect  clientrect    if isEmptyRectCanvas.ClipRect   or isSameRectCanvas.ClipRect,Clientrect then   FullRepaint else   Begin      Randomize a color      Randomize     Canvas.Brush.ColorRGBrandom255,random255,random255       fill dirty rectangle      Canvas.Brush.StylebsSolid     Canvas.FillRectcanvas.ClipRect   end end  procedure TMyControl.WMEraseBkgndvar Message TWmEraseBkgnd begin   message.Result1 end codepre  pstrongUpdatedstrongp  pI just wanted to add that what did the trick was a combination ofp  ol liExcludeClipRect when drawing the nonclientarea, so you dont overlap with the graphics in the clientareali lipCatching the WMNCCalcSize message rather than just using the bordersize for measurements.

After suspecting that it was leading me wrong, I placed down a couple of System.out.println to watch the variables, and according to them they ARE being changed, and that the debugger was just showing me old information for whatever reason. No clue why thats happening, but the important thing is that the code does apparently actually work.p  pIm working on a method to share with twitter for an Android application, and Im having errors when setting up the HttpURLConnection. I create the connection object as per usual, using the openconnection function of a url then casting it to a HttpURLConnection, and when I subsequently run SetRequestMethodPOST on the connection, it does absolutely nothing. When I run the code in the debugger line by line, as I go through that line the request method just remains as the default GET. Anyone have any idea as to why this may be happening Im getting the same problem with setDoOutputtrue also not changing anything. However, adding a request property does still work. Ive been searching around and havent been able to find anything on this problem, not even another person reporting these problems.p

I also realize that this is a case of loss of access of the data [and you can do anything reactive technical wise], but what Im trying to discover is if something can be done proactively to dampen the blow. p  pMy question is how can personal data be protected, without taking away from the actual purpose of the data p  pI can see a need for encrypting all information, but that would prevent groups from accessing the data related to the user. For example, you could encrypt userss zip codes with a private key, but how would you retain the ability to use the zip codes location information. [Maybe to make a claim to the user these people may be near you]p  pIn this hypothetical situation, the attacker is given an exploited database. They can not use the originating system to manipulate the DB. p

That way, the TextWatchers should always be updating strings[] with the correct index.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5H4eb.png altshows an example of the carnagep  pI have every reason to believe that the issue derives from my getView methodp  precodepublic void initList      ArrayAdapterltStringgt listAdapter  new ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis, R.layout.shape, strings              Override         public View getViewfinal int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent               final ViewHolder holder              if convertView  null   convertView.getTag  null                   convertView  LayoutInflater.fromgetContext.inflateR.layout.shape, null                  holder  new ViewHolder                 holder.text  TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.shapetext                 holder.image  ImageView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.shapeimage                 holder.editText  EditText convertView.findViewByIdR.id.shapeedittext                  holder.editText.addTextChangedListenernew TextWatcher                                            public void beforeTextChangedCharSequence charSequence, int i, int i1, int i2                     public void onTextChangedCharSequence s, int start, int before, int count                          if gameType  SHAPESABSTRACT ampamp before  0 ampamp count  1                              InputMethodManager mgr  InputMethodManager getSystemServiceContext.INPUTMETHODSERVICE                             mgr.hideSoftInputFromWindowholder.editText.getWindowToken, 0                                                                                                      public void afterTextChangedEditable s                          strings[holder.ref] s.toString                                                         convertView.setTagholder                                              else                  holder  ViewHolder convertView.getTag                          holder.ref  position             holder.editText.setTextstrings[position]                                           holder.image.setBackgroundResourceimages[position]              if gameType  SHAPESABSTRACT                 holder.text.setTextSeq             else                 holder.text.setVisibilityView.GONE                 return convertView                    grid.setAdapterlistAdapter  codepre

Negative 294 pCan you help me to check whether the logic of my ack server and ack client is correct or not The client keeps sending ack to a server and when the server receives an ack, it generates a timestamp. I find the measured time when client and server are on one machine is very different from client and server are on two machine. For example, on one machine, the measured time is several milisec, but, on two machines, the measured time is hundreds of milisec. I measured each operation which can not exceed 1 ms. So I guess maybe the ack server and client side are not correct. Thanks.p

Negative 294 pI have recently been sold on using CMake for compiling my C projects, and would now like to start writing some unit tests for my code. I have decided to use the Google Test utility to help with this, but require some help in getting started.p  pAll day I have been reading various guides and examples include the a hrefhttpcode.google.compgoogletestwikiV16PrimerPrimera, an a hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksaixlibraryaugoogletestingframework.htmlcadrsintroduction at IBMa and some questions on SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4222169769220herea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5901489769220herea as well as other sources Ive lost track of. I realise theres plenty out there but somehow I am still having difficulties.p  pIm currently trying to implement the most basic test, to confirm Ive compiledinstalled gtest right and its not working.

I have made sure that when linking against the debug libraries, I have then tried to build in debug mode.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHaving done some more digging, I think my issue is something to do with the type of library I am building gtest into. When building gtest with CMake, if codeBUILDSHAREDLIBScode is unchecked, and I link my program against these .lib files I get the errors mentioned above. However, if codeBUILDSHAREDLIBScode is checked then I produce a set of .lib and .dll files. When now linking against these .lib files the program compiles, but when run complains that it cant find gtest.dll.p  pWhat are the differences between a codeSHAREDcode and a not codeSHAREDcode library, and if I choose not shared, why doesnt it work Is there an option in the CMakeLists.txt for my project that I am missingp

Negative 294 pI know the C11 standard is only a month old, but the drafts for codeAtomiccode are much older. I also know the GCC compiler makes a serious effort implementing such features in advance of the standard becoming officially approved. but even a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgwikiAtomic relnofollowtherea the support is not yet ready for primetime.p  pHowever, Id be interested in other compilers as well Visual Studio, or embedded compilers cq. environments. Is anyone compiler provider gearing up to provide such support Any links are welcome.p  pIm asking, because Im working in automotive embedded development, and Im wondering if I should move into that direction myself. Until now, most environments like AutoSAR or Vector OS support have been providing homegrown solutions, for which the new standard now provides specific syntax and semantics, and as long as compiler authors do not move in the direction of C11, this will remain the only real solution.p

However to be certain made sure that I always set the UIAlertView delegate to nil whenever the delegate is deallocated.p  pThe stack trace is as followsp  precodeException Type  SIGABRT Exception Codes 0 at 0x351ce32c Crashed Thread  0  Thread 0 Crashed 0   libsystemkernel.dylib              0x351ce32c pthreadkill  8 1   libsystemc.dylib                   0x370c329f abort  95 2   eLogbook                            0x000bbacd [GetOperationPartsDictionary init] GetOperationPartsDictionary.m22 3   UIKit                               0x32557f93 [UIAlertViewPrivate popoutAnimationDidStopfinished]  855 4   UIKit                               0x3240dc53 [UIViewAnimationState sendDelegateAnimationDidStopfinished]  471 5   UIKit                               0x3241357d [UIViewAnimationState animationDidStopfinished]  53 6   QuartzCore                          0x36eeac2f CALayerrunanimationcallbacksvoid  203 7   libdispatch.dylib                   0x3140ae91 dispatchmainqueuecallback4CFVARIANTup  197 8   CoreFoundation                      0x353ad2ad CFRunLoopRun  1269 9   CoreFoundation                      0x353304a5 CFRunLoopRunSpecific  301 10  CoreFoundation                      0x3533036d CFRunLoopRunInMode  105 11  GraphicsServices                    0x3662c439 GSEventRunModal  137 12  UIKit                               0x32426e7d UIApplicationMain  1081 13  eLogbook                            0x0007767f main main.m14 codepre  pThe thing that is really confusing me about this is that the code[UIAlertViewPrivate popoutAnimationDidStopfinished]code method appears to be calling the init method on my GetOperationPartsDictionary class. From the limited amount of information Ive had from users this crash is happening on startup, at which point that class would not have been loaded.p  pIm using QuincyKit to deliver the crash reports to a server, from there theyre symbolicated using the standard symbolicatecrash script. The version of Xcode being used to symbolicate the crash is the same version that was used to build the binary, and Im confident that the dSYM used to symbolicate the crash is the correct one  the line numbers for my code are correct for example.p  pAnyone have any thoughts on thisp  pEdit should have added that this is occurring in the field with a live app, but only occasionally. It has affected maybe 1 or 2 users in a thousand or so, but I have never been able to reproduce it either on a device or in the simulator.p

Negative 294 pI LEFT ALL THE PREVIOUS WRITING FOR DOCUMENTARY ISSUES, IN THE MEANTIME LOADS OF THINGS GOT CLEARED UP, EDIT2 IS THE CURRENT STATEp  pI am currently working on a simple GUI system for my university coursework and I came up with a simple idea and question. I was thinking about a kind of dynamic labelp  pInstead of passing a valuestring every frame to a static label, I thought it would be nice if a dynamic label class could simply bind every kind of function or pointer to print them automatically every frame.p  pHeres some pseudocode to demonstrate, what I want to achievep  precode OLD WAY   called on initialization CView pView  new CView CLabel pLabel  new CLabel10,20,TEST pViewgtAttachpLabel GUIManagergtSetActivepView  ...  called every frame somewhere pLabelgtSetTextAppTimegtGetFPS AppTime is a singelton with time informations   NEW WAY   called on initialization CView pView  new CView the return type of GetFPS is float CDynamicLabelltfloatgt pDLabel  new DynamicLabelltfloatgt10,20, AppTimegtGetFPS  not only functions or member functions, this should also be possible CDynamicLabelltintgt pDLabel2  new DynamicLabelltintgt20,20, ptrToSomeInteger codepre  pSo I think there must be a way to combine the C templating system and boostbind to get this functionality I want, but I cant figure out how.  I hope someone can give me some hints on how to achieve this. Maybe there is even another way to get this functionality that is more common.p  pEDIT To clear some things up, the C code related to the Dynamic Label is not yet implemented. I am still struggling to find the perfect way to implement it, but to clear some things up about my current class hierarchyp  pI have a virtual class CElement, which every GUIElement gets derived from. There are virtual functions for rendering, updatingwith the passed time as argument and an OnEvent function with the event as argument. Also general visibility function are implemented in the CElement class.  The CView is a class that represents a certain setup of CElements. The GUIManager is a Singleton that forwards all calls to the current view and associated elements.p  pMy basic idea was because the GUI system is part of a game, that the update function gets called anyway every frame if there would be a generic way to achieve self updating labels instead of writing another derived class for a certain label that should simply print the fps to the screen or similar.p  pI hope that cleared things somehow up...p  pEDIT2  deleted because code wasnt working anyway... p  pEDIT3 Got everything working, I used boostfunction and boostbind and wrote a template that can now can do everything I wanted...p

Negative 294 pI have been thinking about what some of the reasons for finding the maximum depth of a binary search tree are, and also what the best uses of the function would be. p  pSo far, a reason I have thought of for implementing it is to maintain the data structures efficiency. If the maximum depth path became considerably longer than the other possible paths, especially compared to the minimum depth path, there may be a much more noticeable hit on performance when traversing through that path, especially considering that a recursive call uses a good amount of memory.p  pWhat other reasons are there for a maximum depth function Thanks in advance for reading my question and responding.p

Negative 294 pIve recently been tasked with writing a sage import tool that imports Quantity Price Break Discounts.p  pThe sage 200 tables in question arep  ul listrongStockItemstrong  Main Product Tableli listrongStockItemDiscountstrong  Main Discount Tableli listrongStockItemQtyDiscBreakstrong  Discount Qty Price Breaksli ul  pI wont bore you with schema information as its not relevant to my question, suffice to say  the primary key in all 3 tables is a BigInt strongwithoutstrong identity set sigh, 1 StockItem can have many Discounts and 1 Discount can have many Qty Discount Breaks.p  pNow then, to create an import routine i first had to analyse what Sage 200 did on SQL if you created Discount and Breaks manually in sage using SQL Profiler. As i say, Sage 200 does not make use of Identity columns, instead it uses a counter table.p  pInserting a new row into StockItemDiscount did the followingp  precodeUPDATE [Counter] SET [NextValue]  [NextValue]  10 WHERE [CounterID]  1 codepre  pIt then selects the new IDp  precodeSELECT NextValue FROM Counter WHERE CounterID  1 codepre  pIt then inserts the new row using the new value it just selected from the counterp  precodeINSERT INTO StockItemDiscount StockItemDiscountID, ... VALUES NewID, ...  codepre  pstrongMy question is thisstrong Why on earth is sage doing it this way what could possibly be the reasoning behind it Specifically the 10 THEN reading the valuep  pAll the tables share the same counter too, so 5 rows in 1 table would results in a gap in the ids of another table  im just really at a loss as to why they do it like thisp  pstrongThe reason i askstrong After inserting a row into codeStockItemDiscountcode i then need to delete any related rows in codeStockItemQtyDiscBreakcode amp insert replacements  however, using SQL profiler i cant see incrementing of the counter table unless i insert 5 or more discounts the 6th causes it to hit the counter table again, its almost as if the Sage UI is reserving those 10 IDs using them for a variety of inserts then reserving an additional 10 as it needs them  this just seems very very odd to mep

Negative 294 pI was wondering if it is possible to create a address book or contacts app, like Apples, that uses Core Data and an SQLite storage file. p  pThe part I am not sure if it is possible, or how to do it is having multiple properties for phones. So a user could input five different phone numbers for the same contact.p  pThe only way I could think of doing it is say... have one entity for the person... then another entity for phones with them having a relationship. So one person could have multiple phones but one phone could only have one person.  But that didnt seem to like it would be a good way to do it... anyone have a suggestionp

But if all threads use the same codeioservicecode would it be parallel p  pI was going through a hrefhttpen.highscore.decppboostindex.html relnofollowhttpen.highscore.decppboostindex.htmla in asio section which says I need to have different ioservices in different threads to achieve parallelization. p  pI if I plan to make a Server class that creates a codenew TCPsessioncode each time a new client appears in codeacceptor.asyncacceptcodebr  and codeTCPSessioncode ctor creates an codeioservicecode and a codethreadcode and runs that codeioservice.runcode in its own thread would it be a good design p  pHowever in this design where would I join all these threads  do I need another codeioservicecode for codemaincode so that it doesnt terminate even before getting a new Client p

I also have a button that sets the textLabel.text property for each of the cells.p  pWhen i press that button, nothing happens visually, even though the labels were really changed.p  pAnd heres the weird thing If i tap on the cell, the value suddenly shows. So i have to tap on each cell to reveal the label text. Now I can tap on the button again which changes the labels, and it will work fine  I only need to tap the cells the first time, and then they stay activated.p

Negative 294 pIm using a NSMutableDictionary to cache high scores that I pull from Game Center storing scores by GC rank as key. The pulling happens as soon as the user views that line in a tableview. If there are a million rows and the user views them all, that would mean that the cache fills up to a million rows... Ok in practice I guess Ill be happy if a million people played my game but still to be on the safe side Id like to limit the amount of rows that go into the NSMutableDictionary.p  pAnyone got a simple approach here Maybe another structure than a dictionary would be useful. My idea was to remove the entries from the dictionary that were the most old, and out of current tableview.p

For now I will be using 1.9.2 as most of this stuff has been a little over my head. Im sure I have made a mistake in lacking some sort of dependency that 1.9.3 requires or not adjusting a config file appropriately. At least this is my assumption, first server setup so much of this has been guessing. p

I thought about writing some kind of logic that says all the numbers above the one you want deleted get 1 subtracted from their value and all the numbers below stay the same. But I think im just going about this the wrong way.p  pAny suggestions on the easiest way to add and delete these text lines is appreciated.p

Negative 294 pIm trying to send data in chunked mode. All headers are set properly and data is encoded accordingly. Browsers recognize my response as a chunked one, accepting headers and start receiving data.p  pI was expecting the browser would update the page on each received chunk, instead it waits until all chunks are received then displays them all.

Negative 294 pI am developing an app where I display a MapView on a tablet screen, touch a particular location, overlay a marker at the location, and save the GeoPoint of the location touched via the onTap event.  I know the screen point being touched very precisely from using the Developers setting which displays screen touch location.  Unfortunately, the points saved all appear to be shifted to the east relative to what Im considering my truth measurement, i.e. clicking the same points in Google Maps on a Windows PC and recording those coordinates.  p  pMy app can DISPLAY markers in the exact location I get from the querying points on the PC, it just cannot GET the same coordinates by querying from the tablet.  Could I have inadvertently shifted the overlay which reads clicks, relative to the map itself  Very frustrating, but my app requires consistency.p  pIs there a reason why getting a location from a PC screen could be more accurate than the corresponding operation on a tablet or phonep

Negative 294 pemIm posting this in Lua and Codea, since thats what Im using, but its a pretty general question I think.emp  pIm considering an overall design pattern for displaying graphics, and Id like to know if there are problems with it. p  pHeres the design pattern Im consideringp  pA codesetupcode method in a codeMaincode class tells a codeGraphicscode class to create some graphic elements for instance, two squares and an ellipse.p  pThe codeGraphicscode class generates the parameters needed for each element, stores them as a table, and sends the table to a codeDatacode class. p  pWhen the app starts drawing, the codedrawcode function in codeMaincode tells the codeGraphicscode class to draw the objects that were created. p  pThen the codeGraphicscode class asks the codeDatacode class to hand back all the tables that it sent over during codesetupcode, and it uses them to draw the elements.p  pcodeMaincode commands codeGraphicscode which commands and queries codeDatacode. Im sure this is a known pattern are there problems generally associated with itp

Negative 294 pI have an image lets say its a simple rectangle positioned on the left of my screen, which I can move up and down. When moving it upwards, I use some simple trigonometry to rotate it so that the rectangle points towards the upper right corner of the screen. When moving downwards, it points towards the lower left corner of the screen.p  pGiven that my application uses the following coordinate system img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfNGZd.png altCoordinate systemp  pI use the following code to achieve the rotationp  precode moving upwards rotation  atan2position.y , res.x  position.x   moving downwards rotation  atan2res.y  position.y , res.x  position.x codepre  pwhere coderescode is the reference point and codepositioncode is the position upper left corner of our rectangle image. For information on codeatan2code a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencecmathatan2 relnofollowatan2 on cplusplus.coma.p  pThis works just fine it rotates more when farther away from the reference point res. However, lets say the image is all the way at the bottom of the screen. If we move it upwards, it will very suddenly rotate. strongI would like to inbetween this rotation, so that it is smoothened out.strongp  pemWhat I mean by suddenly rotating is this Lets say the rectangle is not moving in frame n therefore its rotation is 0 degrees. I then press the up arrow, which makes it calculate the angle. In frame n1, the angle is 30 degrees for example. This is ofcourse not very smooth.emp  pIs my question clear How do I go about thisp

Negative 294 pI am trying to use a hidden Markov model HMM for a problem where I have M different observed variables Yti and a single hidden variable Xt at each time point, t.  For clarity, let us assume all observed variables Yti are categorical, where each Yti conveys different information and as such may have different cardinalities.  An illustrative example is given in the figure below, where M3.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTTbVo.png altenter image description herep  pMy goal is to train the transition,emission and prior probabilities of an HMM, using the BaumWelch algorithm, from my observed variable sequences Yti. Lets say, Xt will initially have 2 hidden states.p  pI have read a few tutorials including the famous Rabiner paper and went through the codes of a few HMM software packages, namely strongHMM Toolbox in MatLabstrong and stronghmmpytk package in Pythonstrong. Overall, I did an extensive web search and all the resources that I could find only cover the case, where there is only a single observed variable M1 at each time point. This increasingly makes me think HMMs are not suitable for situations with multiple observed variables.p  ul liIs it possible to model the problem depicted in the figure as an HMM li liIf it is, how can one modify the BaumWelch algorithm to cater for training the HMM parameters based on the multivariable observation emission probabilitiesli liIf not, do you know of a methodology that is more suitable for the situation depicted in the figureli ul  pThanks.p  pstrongEditstrong In this a hrefhttpwww.revistas.unam.mxindex.phpjartarticleview25279 relnofollowpapera, the situation depicted in the figure is described as a Dynamic Naive Bayes, which in terms of the training and estimation algorithms requires a slight extension to BaumWelch and Viterbi algorithms for a singlevariable HMM.p

Negative 294 pFrom a hrefhttpblog.stephencleary.com201202asyncandawait.html relnofollowemhere emap  blockquote   pAsync methods can return codeTaskltTgtcode, codeTaskcode, or codevoidcode.   Why return codeTaskltTgtcode or codeTaskcode Because theyre awaitable, and void is   not. So if you have an async method returning codeTaskltTgtcode or codeTaskcode, then   you can pass the result to await.p blockquote  pNow consider this example  p  precode1    public async Taskltintgt CalculateAnswer 2        3         await Task.Delay100  4         5          Return a type of int, not Taskltintgt 6         return 42 7        codepre  pI strongdo understandstrong that the moment the control enters the codeasynccode method and meets the codeawaitcode operator , it first check to see if the awaitable has finished , if it has then it runs regularsync. strongand if it didnt , it returns from the codeasynccode method.strongp  pOk so it returns and we need to keep an eye on the async task. and I guess thats why we have codeTaskltTgtcode at the method signature.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pBut Why do I need codeintcode in the  codeTaskltintgtcode  strongthe awaitable has nothing to do with INT strong  it could be a webservice downloading something. in order to keep an eye on the async operation i could use codeTaskcode only. p  pSo strongEitherstrong the codeTasklttgtcode is there to keep an eye for the codeasynccode operation strongORstrong is it there to indicate the return value of the method p  pIm confused. p

I am not really sure how to best apply them, and would appreciate any advice.p  pAdded appendTo option  7948 Previously, dialogs had always been appended to the body to ensure they were the last element in the DOM to avoid conflicts with other stacking contexts. However, in order to allow more flexibility and simplify the stacking logic, an appendTo option has been added which defaults to the body. Check out the API documentation for more information. p  pRemoved stack option  8722 Dialogs previously supported a stack option, which determined whether dialogs should move to the top when focused. As this should always be the case, the opiton has been removed. p  pRemoved zIndex option  8729 Similar to the stack option, the zIndex option is unnecessary with a proper stacking implementation. The zindex is defined in CSS and stacking is now controlled by ensuring the focused dialog is the last stacking element in its parent. p

Negative 294 pIve done a fair amount of searching, but most of what Ive found has to do with merging tables with the same schema..  If this question is too openended, let me know, and Ill try to provide more detail.p  pI have two independent applications, each built on the same general structurep  ul liAn ASP.NET MVC Applicationli liAn object model built on NHibernateli liA repositorybased DALli liAn MSSQL Database.li ul  pThe database schema and object models are different, but there is some businesslevel overlap for example, both applications have a Customer object, but the structures are different there are a few data fields that exist in one but not the other, and the primary keys are done differently one has an autoincrementing numeric field, the other a GUID.  There are perhaps ten tables or classes like Customer, that have distinct implementations in each application.p  pWe are in the process of combining the two applications the end goal is to have application 1 become an Area within application 2, with both apps using the same set of Customers, etc.   p  pMy question is, what is the best way to handle the ten or so shared data objectsp  ol lipCombine them at the databaseobject model level  We could merge the Customer tables from each database into a single table, combine the object model classes, and work our way up into view models if need be.  pli lipTry to manage two sets of objects, and synchronize them  Either via triggers in the database, or perhaps by writing to both sets of tables in the DAL.pli lipSomething elsepli ol  pThis for me a fairly large project, with a several hundred tables, and many, many controller methods and views.  There are zero unit tests, and no documentation to speak of, so its a bit daunting Im leaning towards the first option, but I feel like anything I do is going to break things.

Negative 294 pIs it possible to use clientside and serverside oauth2 authentication without requiring separate user logins for eachp  pThe cross client identity page seems to be exactly what I want, but it doesnt describe how to achieve this for web client and server projects. a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsCrossClientAuth relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsCrossClientAuthap  pSpecifically, here is what Im trying to achieve I have a web app which uses the drive api to create files and the drive realtime api for collaborative editing of documents, so I need to do clientside authentication. I also want to allow users to publicly share readonly copies of the documents with other users. I want to do this by storing a snapshot of the document data in google app engine that can be read by anyone, but can only be written by the user that created the google doc. This suggests that I need serverside authentication. But is there any way to do this without requiring the user to log in once for the clientside access, then again for the server side accessp  pThis question seems to be similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15415442authenticatinggusersontheserversideafterclientsideloginAuthenticating G users on the server side, after clientside logina but the accepted answer seems to suggest simply storing the user id on app engine and checking that the user id on the client side matches. That seems like one would only need to know the user id of the file creator to overwrite the document on the app engine server, which is not secure.p

Now the site has very simple functions  the users can see older reports and their data, and can edit them or add new ones. p  pHowever, the identifier field is actually an integer that symbolizes a log file that is being reported. Most of the times, each report has one log. But sometimes it has more than one. I did it as a CharField because I built the site to replace an older sharepoint 2003 website, where that field was treated as simple text. So I want that in my next version, it would be like it should be, i.e. like thisp  precodeclass Reportmodels.Model     updater  models.CharFieldmaxlength15     pubdate  models.DateTimeFieldautoaddnowTrue     ... and so on...  class Logmodels.Model     report  models.ForeignKeyReport     identifier  models.IntegerField codepre  pThe problem is, since in the old site that field was a CharField, people used this as they liked.

There is a piece of information which is missing.  After the migration to add a Posts table is put in place, how do you access the data in the Posts tablep  pI think that there should probably be a PostsContext.  Or should there be a single context with all the objects  Should the existing BlogContext be updated to allow access to Posts  If that is done, there ends up being errors when doing the migration stating There is already an object named Posts in the database.p

Negative 294 pIm adapting an existing collection of libraries, building them as OSGi bundles. Its a multimodule Maven project, with several layers of POM inheritance and aggregation. Ideally, plugin configuration would be placed in parent POMs only.p  pThe project is composed of more than 100 jars. Theres already a mega bundle that encompasses the entire library and export all packages. My effort aims at making the library more modular, which is the main reason of having them as OSGi bundles in the first place.p  pThe main issue is this library has a split package nightmare, and I cannot change the package structure. Im trying to solve the issue using codeRequireBundlecode, as recommended in the book emOSGi in Actionem, even though the book mentions its not a good practice. I tried the recommendation of using an arbitrary attribute named split in codeImportPackagecode to separate parts of a bundle and only import certain packages. But due to the number of bundles providing the same package, that turned out to be too complicated to configure.p  pMy strongquestionstrong is how to configure the codemavenbundleplugincode codeltRequireBundlegtcode directive, if at all possible, to use wildcards e.g.  as a form of telling it to use all Maven dependencies, instead of having to manually list all bundles names and versions i.e. is there an alternative to thisp  precodeltRequireBundlegtlibapi versionproject.versionltRequireBundlegt codepre  pthat uses some kind of wildcard matching and that could be put in a parent POMp

Negative 294 pI am still learning Angular JS and have this controller which is making two ajax requests to the lastfm api using different parameters. I want to know when each request has been finished, so that I can display a loading indicator for both requests.

Negative 294 pIm about to mark maybe 100,000 records retroactivelyposthocwise with categoryindicating string or integer values. There are more to come. The categories to be marked by this column reflect a scalar continuum of different category types, going anywhere from looser to tighter essentially. I was thinking about using string values though, instead of integers, in case one day I come back to it and not know what means what.p  pSo thats the reasoning for using strings, readability.p  pBut Ill be relying on these columns pretty significantly, selecting swaths of records based off this criteria.p  pObviously whatever it is Im going to put an index on it, but with an index, Im not sure how much faster querying on integers is than using strings. Ive noticed the speediness of using booleans, and can reasonably assume small integers can be queried on more quickly than strings based off this.p  pIve been pondering this trade off for some time now so thought Id fire off a question.

Negative 294 pI need to programmatically find out which JRE classes can be referenced in a compilation unit without being imported for static code analysis. We can disregard packagelocal classes. a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasespecsjlsse7htmljls7.htmljls7.3 relnofollowAccording to the JLSa, classes from the package codejava.langcode are implicitly imported. The output should be a list of a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangClassLoader.htmlname relnofollowbinary class namesa. The solution should work with plain Java 5 and up no Guava, a hrefhttpcode.google.compreflections relnofollowReflectionsa, etc., and be vendor agnostic.p  pAny reliable Javabased solution is welcome.p  hr  pHere are some notes on what Ive tried so farp  pAt first glance, it seems that the question boils down to How to load all classes from a package, which is of course practically impossible, although several workarounds exist e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq5203281005481thisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq11565521005481thisa, plus the blog posts linked there. But my case is much simpler, because the multiple classloaders issue does not exist. codejava.langcode stuff can always be loaded by the systembootstrap classloader, and you cannot create your own classes in that package. Problem is, the system classloader does not divulge its class path, which the linked appoaches rely on.p  pSo far, I havent managed to get access to the system classloaders class path, because on the HotSpot VM Im using, codeObject.class.getClassLoadercode returns codenullcode, and codeThread.currentThread.getContextClassLoadercode can load codejava.lang.Objectcode by delegation, but does not itself include the classpath. So solutions like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq92208871005481this onea dont work for me. Also, the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangSystem.htmlgetProperties2829 relnofollowlist of guaranteed system propertiesa does not include properties with this kind of classpath info such as codesun.boot.class.pathcode.p  pIt would be nice if I didnt have to assume that there is an emrt.jarem at all, and rather scan the list of resources used by the system classloader. Such an approach would be safer with respect to vendor specific JRE implementations.p

Negative 294 pI have been working on a new map that works on Map Areas. On RollOver I am showing the province in a SPAN and this works well but obviously, when I show the SPAN with the province over it, the Map Area which then is the the trigger for the Off state is fired, causing it to bounce up and down which is not what I want.p  pI then resorted to switching from the Map Area to use the active SPAN so that when you RollOver the map area, it shows the SPAN with the province in it and when you RollOut of the SPAN, it is meant to hide the SPAN again.p  pThe problem now is that the SPAN works on a larger square area unlike the Map Area coordinates which means that some of the maps which are smaller are difficult to target.

Negative 294 pSETUPp  pMASTER DEVICE Raspberry Pi Model B REV2p  pSLAVE DEVICE Arduino Uno REV3p  pPROBLEMp  pWhenever I enter r into the command line it returns a number that is completely off what it should be. For example, when I hook my jumper wire to the analog pin A0 up to 5V and press r on the command line it should return 5 volts. Well it returned 255. When I had the jumber wire hooked up to the 3.3V pin it returned 169.p  pNOTEp  pThe person who wrote this code did note something that I thought might be related to this issue. His words were as follows.....p  pThe setup function in the Arduino then sets up two callback functions thatwill be used. The function processMessage will be invoked whenever the on Receive event occurs. This will be whenever a command is sent from the Raspberry Pi. The other callback function, sendAnalogReading, is associated with the onRequest event. This occurs when the Raspberry Pi requests data and will read the analog value divide it by four to make it fit into a single byte, and then send it back to the Raspberry Pi.p  pI have no idea what he means by dividing the value to make it fit into a single byte. Is this why im getting weird numbers back Can someone explain this. p  pJust to make this thread more clear here is my setup and the output that is being displayed from issuing multiple commands. p  psudo python ardupii2c.py ran my programp  pFirst scenario, I hooked the jumper wire from pin A0 to GRD on the arduino. Then I chose the r option and it gave me 0  p  pSecond scenario I hooked the jumper wire from pin A0 to 5V on the arduino. Then I choose r and it gave me 255p  pThird scenario I hooked the jumper wire from pin A0 to 3.3V. It gave me 171. p  pFourth scenario I hooked the jumper wire from pin A0 to the negative side of the LED and it gave me 0p  pFifth scenario I hooked the jumper wire from pin A0 to the positive side of the LED and it gave me 105. p  pSince the first and fourth scenarios seem to work alight im curious why the other numbers where way off and if they have some actual meaning to them. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG6jSP.jpg altenter image description herep  pPSUEDO CODEp  precodeCreates instance of SMBus called bus Prompts user for command l toggles led or r reads from Analog pin 0 if command is l it writes it to arduino and causes onReceive handlerprocessmessage if command is r then requestreading function will be called this will call readbyte in SMBus library that causes the on Request event to be     invoked.  codepre  pPYTHON PROGRAMp  precodeimport smbus import time bus  smbus.SMBus1 SLAVEADDRESS  0x04 def requestreading     reading  intbus.readbyteSLAVEADDRESS     printreading while True     command  rawinputEnter command l  toggle LED, r  read A0      if command  l          bus.writebyteSLAVEADDRESS, ordl     elif command  r          requestreading codepre  pARDUINO PROGRAMp  precodeinclude ltWire.hgt int SLAVEADDRESS  0x04 int ledPin  13 int analogPin  A0 boolean ledOn  false void setup       pinModeledPin, OUTPUT     Wire.beginSLAVEADDRESS     Wire.onReceiveprocessMessage     Wire.onRequestsendAnalogReading     Serial.begin9600  void loop   void processMessageint n   Serial.printlnIn processMessage   char ch  Wire.read     if ch  l        toggleLED void toggleLED   ledOn   ledOn   digitalWriteledPin, ledOn void sendAnalogReading   Serial.printlnIn sendAnalogReading   int reading  analogReadanalogPin   Wire.writereading gtgt 2 codepre

That question explored the strongcausestrong of the problem which I explain below. Here, Im looking for a strongdifferent solutionstrong from those proposed in the answers to that questions which implied changing the declarationdefinition of the codeconstexprcode variable to be used  essentially by adding a definition in a compilation unit.p  pI have created a little variadic template function codemakestringcode to generate a codestdstringcode from any number of ioable arguments as follows.p  precodeusing stdostringstream  just for this example  inline ostringstreamampwriteostringstreamampostr, const charx  ifx ostrltltx  return ostr   templateltclass Tgt inline ostringstreamampwriteostringstreamampostr, T constampx  ostrltltx  return ostr   inline ostringstreamampwriteostringstreamampostr noexcept  return ostr   templateltclass T, class...

The reason is that codemakestringcode takes all its arguments by reference, including the codestatic constexprcode codemaxoffsetcode. As a result, a reference to codefoomaxoffsetcode will be required at linking, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions272900undefinedreferencetostaticclassmembersee alsoa.p  pHow can I avoid this problem without abandoning the idea of codemakestringcode Perhaps one could replace the variadic template with a variadic macro, but I would consider this as some sort of regression. There must be a way for makestring to take its arguments by value or reference, depending on type so that builtin types can be taken by value. Howp

I want to know what can possibly go wrong with what Ive written  like any possible thing. Im not looking for anything in particular, just general problems with the above, like memoryheap issues, pointer mistakes etc.p  pLeave out Virtual Memory Exhausted. My code error checks for that using a wrapper function on malloc, so Im very sure thats not it.p

Negative 294 pWe have a Google Local profile or Google Places for our business and we have added multiple locations for each store.

If you smoothly move the mouse into the sidebar it opens properly, and if you then move the mouse outside it closes properly.

Negative 294 pI have a large WPF app with few threads  all threads use dispatcher.invoke to update the GUI and many grids and controls. At any give time only 2 or three grids are visible so the user can interact with the controls. I also have an external device which sends a signal to my app and I then update the GUI so the user knows the signal was fired.p  pI do the update through a dispatcher since the signal detection is on another thread. So everything is fine until intermittently it takes 5 minutes for the dispatcher.invoke with normal priority to call my method. when this happens as soon as I click the GUI then method gets called immediately. So it seems that message pump is asleep or hung and as soon as I click on the GUI it wakes up and process my message. I have done this several times so I am sure that message queue wakes up upon refreshing the GUI.p  pSo is this a bug in WPF message pump queue where it occasionally goes to sleep and wakes up when the GUI is refreshed or what is the reason for this behavior and what to do about it.p  pThanks in advance p

The Unit testing projects are supposed to have tests that inherits UnitTest class, and the Integration testing projects, tests that inherit IntegrationTest.

Do you know a way to easily move files and keep the configuration in a way that the tests still runsp  pI created a batch, and it moved the files correctly.

Negative 294 pIve been enjoying the new Sails relationships in v0.10, but my biggest challenge currently is looking up models by their associations.

Negative 294 pI have an ASP.NET MVC 5 application using Entity Framework and DataTables a hrefhttpdatatables.net relnofollowhttpdatatables.neta.  This problem is not necessarily specific to DataTables, but I will explain what I am doing in order to present the full picture.p  pI am using the serverside processing option of DataTables to make an ajax call to the server and get data to populate a table of data on the client.  My controller action that is responding to the ajax call is querying the database through EF for appropriate data to return to the client.p  pNow, the DataTables framework offers a search capability where each time a character is entered into the search box, the ajax call is made to the server to get data.  Imagine I am entering characters rapidly into the search box on the client, and each character makes an ajax call to the server which in turn queries the database for new data based on the search criteria. I can easily see where these ajax requests would come in faster than the time needed to complete a database query and return results and thus close the datareader, so I understand the error. My question is what is the recommended approach to solving the problemp  pI come from a world of desktop applications and am still relatively new to web applications.  Based on past experience, my first thought was to put a lock around the database query so only one could happen at a time, but for some reason this doesnt feel right in a web application.p  pI have also read about the MultipleActiveResultSets setting for EF.  Enabling MultipleActiveResultSets does solve the problem, but I have seen other people saying to be very careful with doing this without much explanation as to why it is bad.p  pI also already know about applying ToList to the query to get explicit execution and have done that, but that doesnt solve the initial multiple request problem.p  pIs enabling MultipleActiveResultSets the right solution  Is locking around the database query the right solution  What do you web application experts recommendp

Negative 294 pFirst off I need to tell you that I am new to java I have only been using it for a bout 3 weeks. I have am putting to gather a small app, this page activity has a bitmap image on it with 12 buttons each button is to invoke a different math equation, I have that bit working sofar. But have 3 problems,  1, the results TextView R.id.resultstextbox named  resultsText, dos not clear when a new button is pressed. I have tried declaring the TextView object as a global but get a runtime error. 2, the results are rounded and I need it to be 3 decimal places. 3, the buttons when placed over the bitmap image in graphical layout are all in the correct place, and this is also good when running in the emulator, but when testing on my phone the buttons have all moved, how do I fix this I would appreciate any help I can get for this problem  thanksp  pstronglayout filestrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid

Negative 294 pHere is what I would like to achieve.p  pI have a series of images going from dark to white with all sort of grey levels in the middle. Id like to have a dial like a slider under the frame or over the frame it doesnt matter.

I am not asking for a fully developed solution unless one exists as I am happy to code it myself, but it would be great if you could give me some hints, directions, ideas for making this work.p  ul liHow do I create the sliderli liof course more importantly I do I select the right image to display.li ul  pId like to do something using JS if possible, and not using any external library.

Negative 294 pMain problem solved however still cant get datepicker to disable. More info at bottom of post.p  pIm using MVC 5 and trying to use a codebootstrap datepickercode on one of my forms.p  pMy view works like this I have a ID number field that when populated with a valid ID from my country which takes the form of codeyymmddxxxxxxxcode, needs to disable the codedatepickercode or stop the datepicker from showing so that the user cant edit this field once a valid ID number has been entered, make the codedatepickercode field DateOfBirth codereadonlycode and populate the field with the date of birth in format codeyyyymmdd.codep  pCurrently, I use a ajax call back to my controller which calls a class which verifies the ID number and returns it as something like codeyyyymmdd 120000code and also passes back the gender gotten from the ID number. I then, in the controller, just grab the codeyyyymmddcode, as well as the gender and pass that back to my view as a string via codejsoncode.p  pAll that works fine, however here is where my problem comes in. I now want to pass the DOB to the codedatepickercode and Ive tried a number of different ways, but I cant get it to format correctly as the datepicker gets todays date. I read that I should use code.datepicker.parseDatecode, however I cant get that to work, either I get a typeerror code.datepicker is not definedcode or codeparseDate is not a functioncode depending on how I try to fiddle with it.p  pIm not sure what other info I need to give besides above.

I get a date like code082719code filling the field. p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pWell I managed to fix the populating problem my self when I had a realisation while doing some testing that the bootsrap datepicker doesnt use codedateFormatcode as a parameter and that is should be codeformatcode.p  pHowever I still cant get the datepicker to be disabled so that it doesnt show. It needs to not show so that a user cant edit the date in the readonly field by using the datepicker once.p  pusing codeDateOfBirth.datepickerdisablecode or codeDateOfBirth.datepickeroptions disabledcode doesnt work and I cant get a function on show using codepreventdefaultcode to work either.p  pstrongEdit 3strongp  pWell, Even though no one replied Im updating this thread with my answer. I managed to fix the problem kind of by disabling the dates of the week. So if anyone wants to do something similar they can have a look at my answer below, However Id still appreciate any other suggestions with regards to a better way to disable the picker. Its only an issue with bootstrap datepicker. Anyway, See below.p

Negative 294 pWe have an iPads running iOS 1.51.7application that expects users to fill up a form and press a button to upload the data. The application then connects using VPN to the organizations backend server running a MSSQL web service, and uploads the data. The application had never any problem in connecting and uploading in the past one year until it was recompiled after the distribution certificate was renewed. p  pNow the .ipa generated by Mac OSX 10.9 XCode 5.1.1  Product  Archive and uploading the .ipa to the device via iTunes etc. runs without any problem for the data entry part, but crashes immediately when the server upload button is pressed. I am not going into the details of the connection and web service etc. because when the ipa is created by Xcode  Product  Run with the device connected, the .ipa is transferred to the device and has no problem in connecting with the web service and in uploading,p  pTherefore, the code generated by XCode Product  Run or for simulation with the device connected runs fine in doing the network connection etc., but the code generated by ProductArchive  with nothing changed, is failing in doing the network connection and upload. p  pThis is an urgent situation as the work in the field has stopped for about 200 users. I will be happy to share more if the above explanation is not clear andor not sufficientp  pThanksp

Negative 294 pI am trying to insertupdate contact records in to CRM 2011 On premise RO15 using CRM web services. I am using SSIS package to get data from my source and using C script component inserting them in to CRM.p  pOriginally I was using one row at a time using ContactInputProcessInputRowContactInputBuffer Row method. This would insert one row at a time and after reading a hrefhttpfczaja.blogspot.co.uk201404ssisintegrationwithdynamicscrm.html relnofollowthisa post I changed in to bulk import using ContactInputProcessInputContactInputBuffer Buffer method.p  pThis appears to fix the problem at first when it starts inserting rows. But after about 1500 rows, I get timeout error. Normally, I would change the client side timeout settings in config file but because this is done through script component, I dont see config file. I have also increased timeout limit on server side to 24 hours. p  pThe C code I am using is same as the bulk insert code from the post linked above. I have changed the buffer size to 10 as that is what Scribe use and works well with CRM 2011 setup we have. p  pHow do I fix this timeout issue I am expecting to have around 5K records per integration. p

Negative 294 pIm trying to scrape a website created with the ICEfaces web framework via a node.js script. Ive managed to handle the login just fine, and then get some data from the main page namely ice.session and ice.view, along with the JSESSIONID cookie returned by the login response. p  pThe problem Ive run into is when I try to do an AJAX POST request to the block URLs. If I do the request by itself, it returns some data just not the data I need, but if I do it after any other request, I get codeltsessionexpiredgtcode as a result. It doesnt even matter which of the ICEfaces block URLs I send the request to Ive tried with sendreceiveupdates, disposeviews, and even ping. Ive even tried the same request twice in a row just for kicks, and I always get a codeltsessionexpiredgtcode response in return on the second one. Ive monitored the requests when I browse the page with Chrome, and as far as I know Im sending all the correct form data as well as the correct headers. The page works just fine when I load it in the browser, so there must be something Im not doing right.p  hr  pApparently, the order in which you do the requests matters in ICEfaces i.e. its not stateless, which kind of makes sense I guess. I just moved the requests around and finally got the response I desired.p

Negative 294 pI have been struggling to identify the cause of an error in a PPT Addin that is distributed across about 40 end users.  p  pstrongProblemstrong loss of the ribbon stateloss of the ribbonUI object.p  pFor some users, eventually the codeRibcode object becomes codeNothingcode.p  pUsers assure me they are not getting any runtime errors nor script errors from COM object that we also invoke through this addin. An unhandled error, if user hits codeEndcode would expectedly cause the state loss.p  pNone of the users have been able to reliably reproduce the scenario which causes the observed failure.  This is what makes it very difficult to troubleshoot. I am hoping against hope that there is something obvious that Im missing, or that I didnt anticipate.p  pstrongHow I currently handle loss or RibbonUIstrongp  pIn attempt to combat this, I store the object pointer to the ribbon in strongTHREEstrong places, this seems like overkill to me but it is still apparently not sufficientp  ul liA class object called codecbRibboncode has a property code.RibbonUIcode which is assigned codeSet cbRibbon.RibbonUI  Ribcode during the ribbons codeonLoadcode callback procedure. So we have a codebyRefcode copy of the object itself.  If the ribbon is nothing, theoretically I can codeSet rib  cbRibbon.RibbonUIcode and this works unless codecbRibboncode object is also out of scope.li liThe codecbRibboncode object has property code.Pointercode which is assigned codecbRibbon.Pointer  ObjPtrRibcode.li liA codeCustomDocumentPropertycode called RibbonPointer is also used to store a reference to the object pointer. emNote This persists even beyond state lossemli ul  pSo you can see Ive given some thought to this in attempt to replicate the way of storing this pointer the way one might store it in a hidden worksheetrange in Excel.p  pstrongAdditional informationstrongp  pI can see from robust clientside logging that this the error appears to happen usually but not always during the procedure below, which is used to refreshinvalidate the ribbon and its controls.p  pThis procedure is called any time I need to dynamically refresh the ribbon or part of its controlsp  precodeCall RefreshRibbonid codepre  pThe error appears to sometimes, I cant stress this enough the error emcannotem be replicated ondemand happen during a full refresh, which is called likep  precodeCall RefreshRibbon codepre  pThis is the procedure that does the invalidationp  precodeSub RefreshRibbonid As String      If Rib Is Nothing Then         If RibbonErrorid Then GoTo ErrorExit     End If      Select Case id         Case vbNullString, , RibbonUI             Call Logger.LogEventRefreshRibbon Rib.Invalidate, ArrayRibbonUI,                                              Ribbon amp CStrNot Rib Is Nothing,                                              Pointer amp ObjPtrRib             Rib.Invalidate          Case Else             Call Logger.LogEventRefreshRibbon Rib.InvalidateControl, Arrayid,                                              Ribbon amp CStrNot Rib Is Nothing,                                              Pointer amp ObjPtrRib             Rib.InvalidateControl id     End Select      Exit Sub  ErrorExit  End Sub codepre  pAs you can see, the very first thing I do in this procedure is test the codeRibcode object for codeNothingcodeness.

Negative 294 pstrongTLDRstrongp  pWhat framework can I use to keep 100 application logic on the server while providing the interactivity of a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiRichInternetapplication relnofollowRIAap  pstrongExplanationstrongp  pBack in the 90s, one could build 100 serverside application with ordinary PHP. But then demands for inpage interactivity increased and more and more application logic was moved into clientside javascript. Today, with websocket and fully dynamic DOM, it is once again possible to build serverside applications while satisfying all inpage interactivity requirements. All thats needed on the client is a generic javascript library that syncs DOM with the server over websocket.p  pWhile I believe this approach to web development a hrefhttpblog.angeloflogic.com201403thesurprisingarchitectureoffuture.html relnofollowhas its meritsa, I dont want to discuss pros and cons of this technique here.p  pMy question is about state of the art frameworks available by the end of 2014 that support this style of development. Experimental frameworks are also okay as far as their architecture is sufficiently clear. I dont need a laundry list of existing frameworks. I would like to see some framework that implements this kind of software architecture or, should there be no such framework, I would like to learn about those that get closest to the ideal.p  pMy own research so far shows that a hrefhttpswww.meteor.com relnofollowMeteora is going the right way, but it still encourages too much appspecific javascript on the client and it ties serverside platform to clientside platform i.e. javascript. Ive read about a hrefhttpblog.fogcreek.comthetrellotechstack relnofollowTrello architecturea, which largely reduces the client to a template processor, but templates and associated templatebinding libraries are among the things I would like to move back to server side. a hrefhttpsaws.amazon.comappstream relnofollowAmazon AppStreama will keep all the UI logic on the server, but its prohibitively expensive for web development, especially when users leave apps sitting idly in the background.p  pstrongUpdatestrong All the answers so far focus on Meteor. I have removed Meteor tag, because it might be misleading. Ive mentioned Meteor, because the Meteor presentation made it look like I have a choice as to whether I want to run code serverside or clientside. Its now clear that Meteor wont transmit any UI over the wire, just data. It thus needs half the application on the client, at least in the form of templates.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Ive found a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRrex relnofollowRemote Events for XML REXa, a protocol that could be used to manipulate clientside DOM remotely from serverside app. Theres no clear way to send user actions clicks, edits back to the server, but perhaps these could be defined as extension events in REX, which is permitted by the spec. Its still just a protocol though. No real software I could use.p  pstrongUpdate 3strong I have to clarify one thing. Simply taking serverside templates and translating them to clientside templates, which are then subsequently executed on the client, doesnt count as 100 serverside app logic. While such frameworks allow me to use serverside API, they will inevitably burden the client and expose large part of application code. I am looking for something that only sends rendered content and generic event hooks down to the client.p  pAlso, regarding widgetscontrols, the framework can emallowem clientside code to handle fringe cases new lowlevel widgets, but it emmust not requireem clientside implementation for typical application logic templates and highlevel widgets.p

Negative 294 pI need to present a tree structure in what is basically a list view with support for data virtualization. To do this I need to be able to query for a range of items in the tree based on their index, or position in the visible tree.p  pBecause each node in the tree may contain millions of children, I load children only when a parent node is expanded. On the backend side I want to cache the loaded children for each expanded node in a file.  The frontend then needs to be able to query for the visible range of items as if it was a flat list however.p  pSo for example the treep  ul liRoot ul liA ul liA1li liA2li ulli liB ul liB1li ulli liCli liDli ulli ul  pWould need to be presented as a list like [A, A1, A2, B, B1, C, D]. p  pCollapsing a node, for example emAem would instead yield the result [A, B, B1, C, D].p  pTo do this some kind of index is needed to keep track of expanded nodes and where the cached data resides.p  pTo do this one idea was to have some sort of range map, where we map indices or positions to data files. So for the tree above we could have something likep  precode[0, 0] gt Root, 0 [1, 2] gt A, 0 [3, 3] gt Root, 1 [4, 4] gt B, 0 [5, 6] gt Root, 2 codepre  pSuch an index could allow for fast querying of a range, for example to retrieve all items between index 2 and 5.p  pHowever, what would be a good data structure to store such an index Since expanding or collapsing nodes requires changing the intervals of all successors to the node being expanded or collapsed.p  pOr is there a better way to structure such an indexp

Negative 294 pWe are running a Java server app that is using codeScheduledThreadPoolExecutorcode to manage some work. There are multiple instances running, for different types of work, but each instance only uses one thread. Its not important why this is as theres really no way around it. What we noticed on the production server is that one of these instances stopped working at some point, completely and silently. Restarting the server brought it back again, but the problem isnt solved.p  pI know that using codescheduleAtFixedRatecode will stop if the task throws an exception at some point, but this isnt the case here. We had a recurrent task that simply stopped executing, and new tasks that used the schedule method and still didnt execute.

Negative 294 pi need to send some post request via python requests library, on my application i have LtpaToken2 authentication, when i using internet browser i can access to the application without any problems, when i try to send post request i need to add my LtpaToken2 to cookies, i can do that manually by cheking token via firebug copy and paste to my post request and everything ok, post request will be successfully sent.

Negative 294 pIve examined the output of MediaExtractor on two Android devices, and it appears to produce slightly different samples on them, given the same  video file.p  pWith one device, nonVCL NAL units are concatenated onto the next VCL unit to produce a sample.

Negative 294 pIm creating a multilingual control in VisualStudio 2010, .net 3.5.  Direction from above is to use a resource designer class created by the StronglyTypedResourceBuilder, which basically protects the developer from i.e. abstracts the ResourceManager.GetStringString,CultureInfo function.p  pOne thing that I have noticed about the designer class is that the current Culture property is a static variable internal static Culture and therefore shared by everyone using that class.  Also, when accessing strings the getters do not let one specify a culture it uses the static property.p  pQuestion  Aside from reverting to the ResourceManager.GetString way of doing things...  is there any way that I can have one control get a string from the resource designer class in English, and another get a string in Spanish  I want finegrained control of which Controls show English and which show Spanish thats my issue.p  pI understand that I can set the static property Culture before each access, but a thats a pain, and b with multiple controls hitting this resource file at the same time, thread safety and timing issues arise.p

Negative 294 pI guess this is a duplicated question, but after browsing heaps of related questions, I couldnt find a matching one ... yeah, lame excuse p  pIm currently developing a common interface for a hrefhttppoi.apache.orgslideshowindex.html relnofollowPOIs HSLFXSLFa implementations.

Of course without generics the return type narrowing works as expected.p  pMy goal is to minimize the parameter declarations for the user of the classes  see main method.

Negative 294 pShould a server application that listens on a port, able to detect and logs down any connection attempt done by Syn Scanningp  pstrongTest Scenariostrongp  pI had written a windows program which i simply called it simpleServer.exe. This program is just a simulation of a very basic server application. It listens on a port, and wait for incoming messages. The listening Socket was defined to be a TCP Stream Socket. thats all that this program is doing.p  pI had been deploying this exact same program on 2 different machines, both running on windows 7 professional 64bit. This machine will act as a host. and they are stationed in the same network area.p  pthen, using the program nmap, i used another machine on the same network, to act as a client. using the sS parameter on nmap, i do a Syn Scan, to the IP and Port of the listening simpleServer on both machine one attempt at a time.p  pnote that the 2 hosts already had wireshark started, and is monitoring on tcp packets from the clients IP and to the listening port.p  pIn the wireshark entry, on both machine, i saw the expected tcp packet for Syn Scanp  precodeclient SYNgt host  client ltSYNACK host  client RSTgt host codepre  pthe above packet exchange suggests that the connection was not established.p  pBut on the simpleServer.exe, only one of it had new incoming connection printed in the logs, while the other instance was not alerted of any new incoming connection, hence no logs at all.p  pstrongCode Snippetsstrongp  precode socket bind and listen was done above this loop  whileTRUE      sClientacceptsListen,SOCKADDRampremoteAddr,ampnAddrLen     ifsClient  INVALIDSOCKET              printfFailed accept         continue          dwSockOpt sListen     printf recv a connection sn, inetntoaremoteAddr.sinaddr      closesocketsClient  codepre  pside note yes, since it is just a simple program, the flow might be a little funny, such as no embreakem in the emwhileem loop. so please dont mind this simple and flawed design.p  pstrongFurther Investigationstrongp  pi had also put a emgetsockoptem in the simpleServer right after it went into listening state, to check the differences of both the listening sockets SOLSOCKET option.p  pone notable difference i found between the two hosts, is the SOMAXMSGSIZE. the host that detects the incoming connection has a Hex value of 0x3FFFFFFF 1073741823, while the other one that has no logs is 0xFFFFFFFF 1. not sure if this is related or not, but i just spammed whatever differences that i may found in my test environment. the other value of the SOLSOCKET are more or less the same.p  pside note i tested on some other machine, which covers another windows 7 professional, windows server 2008 r2, windows server 2003. i am not sure if it is coincidence or not, but machine that have SOMAXMSGSIZE  1, they all did not detect the connection of the Syn Scanning. but maybe it is just a coincidence. i have nothing to prove tho.p  pstrongHelp That I Neededstrongp  ul liwhy is the different behavior from the 2 same of the same application on a different machine with the same OSli liwhat determines the value of the SOMAXMSGSIZE considering two same OS but having 2 different values.li ul

Negative 294 pScenario, XML examplep  precodeltoutergt     ltinner gt ltoutergt codepre  pI need to use Mavens Jaxb plugin, any will do, as long as it will generate xml from xsd. The schema states that outer element must occur once, and inner element has minoccurs 0. The inner element has also attribute, which is also minoccurs 0. Element having more than just a value makes it as a class. Im receiving the example xml, and after doing unmarshalling, it saves the inner element as empty instance and not null. When Im doing marshalling again, I get validation errors because the inner element is not ignored though its null in sense. p  pWhat I need is a way to make these elements with just  ending and nothing else to be read as null, so they wont be marshalled or validated, just ignored, dropped, unless they are specified to occur.

Negative 294 pIm implementing a subclass of a Duplex stream, and data is going to be written at the same time as it is being read.

Negative 294 pI am looking for a discussion on REST API standard patterns.  I have an implementation in a NoSQL style ... that is, there is one table that contains objects Agenda Items which each have a list of references to records in another table Documents.  In the UI I am building, a user can select an existing Attachment, and attach it to the Agenda Item.  You can not, in this UI, create new Document objects, only refer to existing ones.  Since this is a NoSQL implementation, I am not joining the tables on the docid, but manipulating them as separate tables.p  pThere are two ways to implement the REST api.  First is strongdenormalizedstrong where one request gets the Agenda Item records, and a second request gets the Documents.  Using the docid from the Agenda Item, in client you find the associated document information.p  precode[         name Agenda Item 1,     attachments [11556, 87544]     ,         name Agenda Item 2,     attachments [33445, 87544]      ] codepre  pand the document list isp  precode[         name Design Spec A.ppt,     id 11556    ,         name Design Guidelines.doc,     id 33455    ,         name User Studies.xls,     id 87544    , ] codepre  pThe second approach is to construct the REST such that the JSON representation of the Agenda Item includes all the document details within one request.  I will call this strongtrashystrong because there is extra information that did not come from the table.p  precode[         name Agenda Item 1,     attachments [         name Design Spec A.ppt,         id 11556       ,                 name User Studies.xls,         id 87544       ]     ,         name Agenda Item 2,     attachments [         name Design Guidelines.doc,         id 33455       ,                 name User Studies.xls,         id 87544       ]      ] codepre  pThe latter format is p  ul liemconvenientem for the client because in a single request you get all the information you need to present a nice display to the user.  li lieminefficientem because the information about one document is sent twice. It might be in general a lot more information than this example. li liemtrashyem because if you POST this same format back in an update command, the extra details about the document should be ignored  only the id is relevant for updates.  If you were to change the name of a document in this structure, presumably that document would NOT be updated with the new name.  Because the document appears twice in this structure, there is the potential that it has a different name at different points.li ul  pSeems that the rule might be that you add in the extra document information when GETTING the information, and ignore that extra information when PUTTING or POSTING the JSON structure.p  pA third option is the stronghybridstrong  You get the fat filledin form, but you PUT back the lean denormalized form.  I would prefer not to have two different formats for the same object.  I am using AngularJS and the fetched JSON objects translate directly in JS object trees, and it is mighty convenient to put the exact same thing back.   p  pI have implemented both, and both approaches work, but I would like pointed to a discussion about what is the wisdom of each approach  p  pAlso, when using AngularJS, it is very convenient to put additional members into collection for the UI, for example a selected flag.  Again, maybe I am too lazy, but stripping this selected flag out of each record before posting back for updates is a bother, and if I can assume that extra trashy data members will be ignored it makes the coding a lot easier.  Is it OK to assume that your REST API will ignore extra elementsp

Negative 294 pThere is an issue with the android chrome browser the one from the play store, not the built in one. If you select an input field and the soft keyboard pops up and type in a value, and then click on a second input field, the soft keyboard disappears.  You then have to click on the second input field again in order to get the keyboard to appear again.  This is a really bad user experience obviously, and I wanted to know if there were any work arounds known, either with HTML or CSS.p  pCan test just with the w3 schools example of the  tag. a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comtagstryit.aspfilenametryhtmlformsubmit relnofollowhttpwww.w3schools.comtagstryit.aspfilenametryhtmlformsubmita  Click on the first name field and make a change.

Negative 294 pIn quite a few languages like C and D, code1fcode is be a valid way to declare a float literal, but in C the closest you can get by default is code1.fcode or code1.0fcode.

Negative 294 pI have a bit of complicated situation. I must create analyzers code fix providers for situations such as a parameter is only assigned but never used or local variable are never used.p  pFor the parameter situation, Im going for the method declaration and looking at the parameter list to get all the analyzer. Im going through assignment expressions within the method and I filter the parameters that were assigned with an helper method.p  pWhere it gets fuzzy is I have no clue or to know when a local variableparameter is used or not. Ive gone through symbols but they cant tell me that variable used not used. I could try to find how many times a variables name was mentioned inside a method by turning the method declaration syntax context in a string and look for the parameters that were assigned but thats simply such a BAD idea.p  pIm really stuck and I would some help for this from anyone who had previous experience with this kind of situation.p  pFor people who might ask, Im mostly looking for the missing logic for the analyzer. I have no idea how the code fix provider will work. If you have an idea of what I could do, feel free to include it in your answer  As of now, I was thinking that a local variable thats not used could be deleted from a method and the same could go for an unused parameter.

Negative 294 pI am new to Python and trying to send a byte array as a raw packet using a socket. My IP is code192.168.0.116code and the device I am sending this to is code192.168.0.64code. This client device is a microcontroller based unit which is executing my code to simply sniff the Ethernet packets and check for a particular pattern. I am using UDP packets and tried the client side firmware by using Ostinato in my PC to send a raw UDP packet. I am using Wireshark to monitor the network packet flow. The client seems to work fine with packets sent by Ostinato. p  pHowever when I try to send the same packet with Python using raw packets as follows, it doesnt seem to spit out the bytes as I cant see anything on Wireshark nor the client get any data. But the return value from codesendtocode is correct. So it seems that Python feeds the byte array to a buffer to be sent by OS but stops there. p  precodeimport socket CLNTUDPIP  192.168.0.64 CLNTUDPPORT  5005 svrsock  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKRAW, socket.IPPROTORAW  senddata  [0x00, 0x11...] senddataarr  bytearray senddata svrsock.bind 192.168.0.116,0   bytessend  svrsock.sendto senddataarr, CLNTUDPIP, CLNTUDPPORT svrsock.close codepre  pI have taken out the tryexcept blocks for clarity. p  pAnother thing I noted is that when the socket is closing, it takes a bit of time. If I comment out the sendto statement, it exits immediately. So it seems like the socket close is trying to flush the send buffers, which failed to send the packet.p  pAny ideasp

I need to write a program that will fetch messages from this file and if the file is updated, reads another line from it, transforms to some message, applies special business logic and sends it somewhere.p  pThis problem boils down to the following separate problemsp  ul liFile input component needs to read input up to the nearest newline and do not try to read the whole file at once again, as I said before writes are occasional and it is critical to read and process each new line separately in the file as soon as it appears in that file.li liFile input component needs to track file by file name. Once an old file is deleted, it should start trying to read a new file at the same location once an old one is completely processed.li ul  pThe overall problem is actually similar to what tools like logstash are solving but I really would not like to use them as I have complex java business logic in place and I want to have automated and extensive test suite around different aspects of message processing as this task is much more critical than log processing.p  pMy current prototype is implemented as an ad hoc Endpoint Im almost not using any standard Camel components, it is hairy and not very flexible.p  pAlso changing the way in which process A communicates its messages is not possible. I would really prefer JMS or something like that but unfortunately it is not an option.p  pUPDATE 1 I obviously tried to use file component but I had no luck in solving both of file inputrelated requirements  that component cant read additions to the file done after some time and it cant track file at the same location.p  pUPDATE 2 Surely, I read a lot of similar Camelrelated questions on stackoverflow but they all seem to have much simpler inputrelated requirements.p

Negative 294 pFor debugging sporadic crashes in Sophis Risque, we need to be able to run Sophis with our C plugins in a runtime code analysis tool such as BoundsChecker or Purify. I have successfully used both of these tools Risque 4.x versions, but none of them works anymore since Risque 5.3.x. Even without our plugins, neither the Sophis Client, nor any Toolkit API applications ever manage to successfully initialize the session  the process will crash before the Toolkit Log is created. I have the impression that Risque stopped working with Purify somewhere between risque 4.5 and 5.2, and with BoundsChecker between risque 5.2 and 5.3. Under Risque 5.3, Ive tried upgrading BoundsChecker from 9.01 to 10.5.897.1, but the same problem occurred during the call to CSRApiInitialise an Unhandled exception was detected and the process couldnt continue. Meanwhile we use Risque 6.3.x and need some serious tools for debugging.p  pQuestion Which runtime memory checking tools and which versions thereof have been ever known to work with Sophis Risque 6.x  Are we really limited to the Basic Runtime Checks available for debug builds in Visual Studio via C project propertiesCode GenerationBasic Runtime Checks RTCs RTCu RTCsu Thanksp

Negative 294 pI want to see the size of file that is being transferred over the wire. Its quite big 400KB but what is the size of the file when it is compressed. The posts I have seen on the internet say the 400KB file I see in Chrome Tools is the amount over the wire but I save the file to my machine it is the same size, if I compress it to a zip file it becomes 120 KB which suggests the 400 KB is uncompressed. Unless IIS isnt compressing it but dynamic compression is on. Can anyone suggest how I can make sure whether the 400KB is before or after compressionp  pEDIT Ive figure out how to display size and content in Chrome and they are the same  Is this IIS not compressing or is this the size of file after compression.p
