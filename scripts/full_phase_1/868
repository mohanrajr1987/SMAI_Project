Positive 868 pSo theres a huge, completely unknown GWT project. GWT and Spring are also unknown to me. I really just need to tweak a simple thing. When a request is sent to the server the content type header saysp  precodeContentType textxgwtrpc charsetutf8 codepre  pHowever server replies withp  precodeContentType applicationjson charsetutf8 codepre  pIm not sure why. I wanted to use Filter on that as explained in this answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3541165607407httpstackoverflow.coma3541165607407ap  pI added a filter and when Ive put a breakpoint in it, it triggered. This is the codep  precode      String contentType  httpRequest.getHeaderContentType        if contentTypenull ampamp contentType.containsutf8 ampamp contentType.containstextxgwtrpc           httpResponse.addHeaderContentType, textxgwtrpc charsetutf8 codepre  pSo apparently, my header is being overriden, which kinda breaks the point of the filter. There are no other filters specified. Also search for codeaddHeadercode did not reveal any conflicting usages of that function. So is there yet another XML configuration file I need to dig in           p

Positive 868 pIm trying to build a dynamic web app in GWT, when widgets are added to the screen I remember their name by setting the Widget.setId, when I want to replace part of the page, I can find the element in question via DOM.getElementByIdname, and its parent using DOM.getParentElement, and then remove its children.  p  pNow I have a com.google.gwt.dom.client.Element object the parent.

Negative 868 pI am developing a specialty application where the enduser needs to operate multiple controls simultaneously.  The application is used to tune the control parameters of an electronic device to calibrate the unit to its best performance.p  pCurrently, there is a UI with multiple graphical sliders which the operator clickdrags one slider at a time.  He can also click on a slider, and use the mousescroll wheel, which is a little easier to use.p  pThis works, sort of, but is somewhat cumbersome.  The various parameters 5 in this particular case are sufficiently independent of each other so that I cant just refactor the parameters into a single adjustment.  And, if the operator can keep his eye on the device being adjusted, rather than the UI of the control application, it would speed up and simplify his work.p  pOne idea that I had was that I might buy a whole bunch of the USB jogdial products, and bind each dial to a specific control.  This way, the operator can quickly adjust any parameter, or even two parameters simultaneously.  BTW, Griffin PowerMate comes to immediate mind, but I know there are a few other jog dials out there.p  pDo you have any suggestionsp  pADDEDp  pKeep in mind that in some cases, the parameters are adjusted in different directions, and may be significantly different in the adjustment steps.  Its not a simple track two channels together, and then fine tune the last bit of difference.p

Negative 868 pMathWorks currently doesnt allow you to use cout from a mex file when the MATLAB desktop is open because they have redirected stdout.

Negative 868 pThe company that I work for develops a C application to manage service businesses dispatching, GPS tracking, CRM, etc. The problem is that the system is a little too limited. Being a relatively small company, wed like to broaden the horizons and add some more modern features such as a web interface and plugins for various other applications, like Outlook, that would enable them to interact with data in our application.p  pCurrently, Im developing a web interface in ASP.NET MVC and have been for the last two months. However, this implementation is suffering from the same kind of limits that the C application has, so I would like to take things a step further. Its just that Im not sure if this is a wise decision, or how I should go about convincing management that the greatly increased development time will mean greater possibilities in the future.p  pWhat I would like to do is implement some sort of massive API using WCF that would allow access via both web and desktop applications. My web interface could then be just that... and interface to this API using a framework such as Qooxdoo or ExtJS. But other interfaces could be added, such as an iPhone application, an Adobe AIR application, an iGoogle Widget, an Outlook plugin, etc.p  pHeres the thing, though... at the moment, Im just a lot of talk. I have a good knowledge of C and .NET technologies like WPF, WinForms, ASP.NET MVC, etc. But, Ive never used WCF in my life. Im pretty sure I can pick it up, but is it possible to grasp something so extensive as WCF when my employer wants to see fast resultsp  pOne way that I believe I can show results is to release the API incrementally. For example, the first Community Technology Preview would include simple dispatching functionality, he next CTP would include sales and marketing features, and so on. I dont really think customers would pick it up very quickly, but it would allow us to internally develop applications such as a web interface and plugins.p  pOne problem I see with that is spending so much time developing the API that the development of applications that actually USE the API would be extremely slow. I mean, I could show a URL to my boss that returns a list of customers in JSON format, but what can that really do for us if the customers cant do anything with itp  pI guess what Im trying to ask is how feasible is it to drop development on a limited web application thats almost finished and begin work on a WCFbased API to power future projectsp

Negative 868 pI understand that only one instance of any object according to .equals is allowed in a Set and that you shouldnt need to get an object from the Set if you already have an equivalent object, but I would still like to have a .get method that returns the actual instance of the object in the Set or null given an equivalent object as a parameter. p  pAny ideastheories as to why it was designed like thisp  pI usually have to hack around this by using a Map and making the key and the value same, or something like that.p  pEDIT I dont think people understand my question so far. I want the exact object instance that is already in the set, not a possibly different object instance where .equals returns true.p  pAs to why I would want this behavior, typically .equals does not take into account all the properties of the object. I want to provide some dummy lookup object and get back the actual object instance in the Set.p

Negative 868 pThis is pretty high level but Cocoa is big and Im still trying to get my head around it. Can someone validate my expectations...p  pSay Id like to have a variable number of views images of cars for example on the screen that the user can touch and move around. Would you start by subclassing UIView with UIImage property as opposed to UIImageView or a UIButton. Then instantiate say red, blue and yellow cars in the view controller and store them in an NSMutableArrayp  pI could set up the initial layout in Interface Builder but not sure how to connect the custom objects back to the array Some need to start in a rotated state.

I originally decided to use boxshadow since I figured that it would remove the need to use an image, which would remove any possibility of scroll lag.p  pI know that CSS3 is still new, but is this the reason for the lag Is the shadow being software rendered or something When I apply the box shadow to smaller elements, it doesnt lag at all.

Negative 868 pI have a question on how to optimize a query. Actually, as Im going to be running the query frequently, I was thinking of using a materialized or indexed view is this a good idea here or denormalizing.p  pConsider the following four tables with irrelevant fields omittedp  ul liUsers int userIdli liGroups int groupIdli liGroupMemberships int userId, int groupId, bool isSharingli liComputers int userIdli ul  pThe relationships are that a user can have 0..n computers one user to many computers and can be a member of 0..n groups. A group can have 0..n users many users to many groups. The isSharing denotes whether a user is sharing to that group or is a readonly member of that group that is, can see sharing members computers, but does not share her own.p  pThe query is to find, for a given user what computers that user can see. A user can see all of her own computers. She can also see any computers of other users who are in groups that she is a meber of and are sharing to that group. Okay, that doesnt make much sense, so heres the goal in On3 psudocodep  precodeListltComputergt l foreachComputer c in Computers     ifc.userId  currentuserid         add c to l     else         foreachGroupMembership m where m.userId  currentuserid             foreachGroupMembership m2 where c.userId  m2.userId ampamp m.groupId  m2.groupId                 ifm2.isSharing                     add c to l codepre  pRight now Im using an ORM mapper and basically doing the above Im not too good on the whole SQL thing, but that is obviously a lessthanideal solution. I have indexes on every field I listed there except isShared and an extra index on GroupMemberships userId, groupId tuple. But can any database wizards out there think of a better solutionp  pThe projects not live yet, but Im guessing there would be an average of maybe 1.2 computers per user everyone will have one, a few may have more and maybe 0.75 group memberships per user many users wont use the groups feature, but those who do will likely be members of multiple groups. Also, all these associated tables will receive frequent additions, which may make materialized views a less practical solution. Im using SQL Server 2008.p  pThanks, All the best, Robertp

Negative 868 pIm using D3DXSaveSurfaceToFile to save windowed Direct3D 9 surfaces to PNG, BMP and JPG files.  There are no errors returned from the D3DXSaveSurfaceToFile call and all files open fine in Windows Photo Viewer and Paint.

Negative 868 pI have a set of classes in a logging framework used by project A and B. I am refactoring the framework so it can be used in project B and C. The refactoring mainly consists of giving everything template parameters project A might run on an embedded device with poorno STL implemenatation, while B and C just run on a pc, but B is single threaded while C uses multithreading.p  pThis works well, but results in what seems to me an awfull lot of template parameters and a rather ugly typedef mess. I need like 20 lines to typedef all classes Im going to use, and there are also lots of classes taking a template parameter they do not use themselves, but is needed to be able to typedef another class they do use which is not per se a bad thing, but in the end everything starts to llok really complicated. Another problem is that when I want to add some functionality to class A and it requires adding a container, class A needs an extra template paramater. As a result, all other classes seeingusing class A suddenly also need that extra parameter leading to a domino effect.p  pSlightly exaggerated examplep  precodetemplatelt class string, class map, class mutex gt class MessageDestination    typedef Messagelt string, map gt messagetype   virtual void Eat const messagetypeamp   0   templatelt class string, class map, class stream gt class MessageFormatter    typedef Messagelt string, map gt messagetype   virtual void Format const messagetypeamp, streamamp   0   templatelt class string, class map, class containerA,           templatelt class, class gt containerB, templatelt class, class gt class queue, class allocator gt class ThreadedMessageAcceptor    typedef Messagelt string, map gt messagetype   typedef MessageDestinationlt string, map gt destinationtype   typedef containerBlt destinationtype, allocator gt destinationstype   typedef queuelt messagetype, allocator gt messagestype  codepre  pI can think of some techniques to clean this up, but Im having a hard time deciding what one or which combination to use.

Negative 868 pOur application at work uses the ExtJS Sencha framework for the UI. The problem I have with the framework is the amount of HTML that is output by the framework.p  pI have noticed that the areas of the system that are reported as being slow by users have a ton of CSS calculation calls. I measured this in Googles Speedtracer and some pages take 8seconds to load. 80 of the time is dedicated purely to CSS calculations. Before trying to alter the way the framework works, is there anyway to delay CSS calculation of a page, or are these calculations done when the objects are renderedp  pI have been searching for ways to do this, and maybe my googlefu is terrible, but I havent found anything concrete on how to achieve something like this.p  pEDIT After speaking a colleague, he pointed me in the direction of calling .suspendEvents on the grid before loading any data and .resumeEvents afterwards, this alone has saved 300ms of loading time O This is reducing the number .getStyle calls detected by Firebug. I am yet to test this difference with Google SpeedTracerp

Negative 868 pIm new to multithreading and a somewhat beginner  intermediate programmer, and so I may be missing something very obvious.  Im currently working on an application that has to pull data off a server a bloomberg server to be exact and also run business logic.  p  pTo pull data off the server, you basically have to run an endless loop to constantly refresh the data.  Currently, all the data pull code  logic is in one seperate class, and has a number of public objects dataDict in code below that get updated with the newest data.  p  pMy thought was to run the data pull part of the program on a seperate thread, and have the rest of the business logic run on the main thread.

Oh, FYI  this is run a few lines before the previous code so Im not sneaking in any extra object creation there.p  pSo I need a way to determine which object is in fact causing the error.p  pLadislav  FYI  I have a common library that contains all the business objects BO.  This common library is used by other projects  Windows Service, Web Service, etc.  Ive tried to make each BO responsible for populating and saving itself, so that I dont have one hugo data access class.  Each BO is responsible for its own Save method.

This worked fine, as long as the objects werent very complex, and didnt depend on each other, i.e. only contained base type properties like int and string.p  pBut once I started getting these concurrency errors, I dug into it and found out that the DataContext somehow held on to references to objects strongeven when it was disposed ofstrong  Thats a bit of a crazybad piece of engineering, IMHO.  i.e. So if I add a Customer BO to the DataContext then allow the DataContext to go out of scope and be Disposed, and then spin up a strongnewstrong DataContext to do something, the original Customer BO pointer is still therep  pSo I read a bunch on StackOverflow with many answers by you, I might add, a hrefhttpwww.westwind.comweblogposts246222.aspx relnofollowRick Strahls treatise on DataContext Lifetime Managementa and the a hrefhttpwww.codemagazine.comarticleprint.aspxquickid0907071ampprintmodetrue relnofollow8 Entity Framework Gotchas by Julia Lermanap  pSo Julia says put in a Dispose method, and I did, but it didnt help, the DataContext is still magically holding onto the reference.p  pSo Rick says try to use a global DataContext, so that you only have one DataContext to worry about, and it should know everything thats going on, so it doesnt step on its own toes.  But that didnt seem to work either.  To be fair, Rick is talking about Linq to SQL, and a web app, but I was kinda hoping  it would apply to me too.p  pAnd then various answers say that you strongDontstrong want a Global DataContext, since its going to get very big, very quickly, since its holding all the info about all your objects, so just use DataContext for a emUnit Of Workem.p  pWell, Ive broken down a emUnit of Workem to mean all changes, additions and updates done to a group of objects that youd like done together.  So for my Example Here are some BOs and propertiesp  pstrongMessageGroupstrongbr  Property Listbr  Property Customer  p  pstrongCustomerstrongbr  Property Listbr  Property List  p  pstrongMessagestrongbr  Property Customerbr  Property MessageGroupbr  Property User  p  pstrongUserstrongbr  Property Customerbr  Property List  p  pIn the system when a MessageGroup arrives as Xml, its examined and parsed.  The MessageGroup constructor used Dependency Injection and takes the DataContext as one of its parameters  so all the child BOs being created are using this one instance of the DataContext.  The Customer is fetched from the database or a new one is created and assigned to the MessageGroup... lets assume its an emexistingem Customer  so no updates need to be done to it, its fresh out of the DataContext.p  pThen the MessageGroup.Messages list is looped and the first Child BO to create is a new User object.  I assign the same Customer object from the MessageGroup to the User.  However, when context.Users.Addthis is called, I get the error.  If I dont assign the Customer to the User, I dont get the error.p  pSo now I have a Customer or a child property, Im not sure thats fresh from the DB, that I dont need tracked causing me angst.  I thought I could just remove it from the context by using something likep  precodevar cust  Customer.GetCustomerFromExternalIdcrm.CustomerId dataContext.Detachcust dataContext.SaveChanges codepre  pBut I still get the error, even though Ive explicity removed it.

Negative 868 pI have a static library that is used in production code and test code. I want to be able to inject test data only if I am building the test .exe. I would like to do this using preprocessor defines, rather than MSVS configurations e.g., Debug vs. Release because I am testing performance. Debug builds turn off optimization, which is great during debugging but not so great when I want to test performance.p  pAs an example, say I have Foo.lib, Production.exe, and Test.exe projects in MSVS.  Production.exe and Test.exe both link Foo.lib.  I would like Production.exe and Test.exe to rebuild Foo.lib with their respective preprocessor definitions, so the code in Foo.lib will conditionally compile based on which executable it is targeted for.p  pIm open to other solutions, and I hope I stated my problem clearly.

Negative 868 pThis isnt so much a question to help me figure out a problem as it is one to help me figure out why the fix I came up with works.p  pI have some elements on a page which are created with jquery after loading some data with ajax.

Negative 868 pI am building a community site where logon will be by email and members will be able to change their namenick name.p  pDo you think I should keep member namenick name in my members table with other properties of member or create another table, write member namenick name on that table  and associate members id.p  pI am in favour of second option because, I think it would be faster to pull members name from it.p  pIs it rightbetter wayp  pUpdate reason is for other table is that I need to pull username for different sections. For example forums. Wouldnt it be faster to query a small table for each username for each post in a from topicp

Negative 868 pI dont see that theres any way to define a stylesheet for a specific QTreeWidgetItem, so Im resolved to attempt to figure my solution out using either SetBackground or SetForeground.

Any ideas Thanks in advance.p
Negative 868 pIs there a way to inspect the contents of the stack both in terms of the values and the type of the values, and the current instruction point programmatically on the JVM even if its vendorspecificp  pFor example, I would like to inspect the current activation frame and extract the method name it belongs to, as well as stack variables. Furthermore, I would like to be able to iterate activation frames in this way.p  pIs this possible At a first glance, the a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase1.5.0docsguidejvmti relnofollowJVMTIa seems to allow this, but its meant to be used as a native interface. It has been a hrefhttpjournal.thobe.org200811callframeintrospectiononjvm.html relnofollowuseda to implement a Java library that can do these things, apparently  but this seems to be a bit dated. I was wondering if there is a solution integrated into the JVM api, or some other crossplatform JVM library that allows this.p

Negative 868 pRecently I had a bit of a problem with a site on AppHarbor which I wrote about on their support forums a hrefhttpsupport.appharbor.comdiscussionsproblems1562requestissecureconnectionalwaysreturnsfalse relnofollowRequest.IsSecureConnection always returns falseap  pIn short, because the load balancer is decrypting the HTTPS traffic before it hits the web app, attributes such as codeRequest.IsSecureConnectioncode and configuration like coderequireSSLcode on forms auth is not behaving as expected. In fact in the latter case, you cant even authenticate as the app thinks the request isnt coming over HTTPS.p  pIts the forms auth which is especially problematic because without it, cookies arent set to secure and are sent back over HTTP if the site is accessed by domain name only and implicitly serves up the insecure URL scheme.p  pWhat would be the best workaround for this Id prefer to leverage the native security configuration, can anyone see a way to override the implementation which checks if the connection is secure Its easy enough to detect whether the request was served over HTTPS either based on codeRequest.Url.Schemecode or the codeXFORWARDEDFORcode header, its just a question of neatly tying this in.p

Negative 868 pIm trying to implement session context data for a queued messaging system.p  pThe session handling goes like this A front end application authenticates itself and receives a session id. After that the session id is included in the message headers, so a message handler is provided with a context for e.g. security checks and audit logging. The client may pick up a session if it crashed and continue with its work.p  pSo now we want to associate keyvalue pairs with the session id. But this creates many concurrency problems if the session data changes, as the session data used by the message handler should be that at the time the message was sent.p  pI see two possible solutionsp  ol liPut the associated session data in every message headerli liStore the session data versioned to the database and use a version id in the message header.li ol  pThe first makes messages bigger, the second makes the session DB bigger and creates a lot of infrastructural code. I have to save the most current values to the DB in both, so a client may continue its work if it crashed or lost connection.p  pAre there any other solutions I tend to use the first solution, but want to get some feedback first.p  pHow do others deal with this e.g. JMSNServiceBusMasstransitp  pUpdate based on Answer Ive chosen to take the route of convincing my team members to use the session data only in the frontend and putting it into the messages if it is required for the message handler.p
Negative 868 pIve been trying to write a program in C that will monitor running processes in the background and terminate a certain one if its detected to be running. I have written a program that will do so, however the only way I can think of to do this is to use an infinite codeWHILEcode loop that keeps checking for the program. This, as you can imagine, constantly uses CPU power and resources to be constantly looping. In task manager, you can see that most processes that are running are always using 0 of the CPU. My question is How can I write or modify this program to run in the background, utilizing 0 of the CPU until it detects the process its supposed to terminate My entire program is below.

Negative 868 pNew to RubyRails, so bear with me.p  pI have a ActiveRecord model class strongStatusstrong.  Im rendering it as json to be used in a mobile web application. It consists of an strongid, name, code, and backcolorstrong in decimal color.  I needed to do a color conversion from BGR decimal to RGB hex, so I decided to employ the strongcolorstrong gem.  Ultimately, though, I think the problem fundamental to my method definition.  p  pWhen I request a single record codestatuses1.jsoncode, everything works as expected.  When I ask for the index codestatuses.jsoncode, I get a Internal Server Error 500.  The most detail Ive been able to get from that is an codeArgumentError ArgumentErrorcodep  pI defined the method to do the conversion like sop  precodedef colorhex  bgr  ColorRGB.fromhtmlbackcolor.tos16 converts dec to hex, then creates new color object from it  rgb  ColorRGB.newbgr.blue,bgr.green,bgr.red swaps red amp blue into new color object  rgb.html outputs rgb hex for use in html end codepre  pI also included a custom codeasjsoncode in the model, adding the codecolorhexcode methodp  precodedef asjsonoptions   supermethods gt colorhex end codepre  pFrom my controller, I use the standard codeformat.json  render json gt statuses code.p  pAs I said, I thought it was a fundamental problem, so I simplified the method as a proof of concept could I at least manipulate the backcolor at allp  precodedef colorhex  backcolor  1 end codepre  p...and it works for both the show and index actions.  As soon as I introduce the color gem in any capacity, it doesnt work.  Again, Id attribute that to how Im using the gem, rather than a problem with the gem itself.p  pWhat core principle have I neglected to followp  pstrongTL,DRstrong Im rendering as json, and my custom method is working for the show action, but not the index action.p
Negative 868 pIve got a simple LinearLayout with a custom SurfaceView class and some buttons. Previously I had forced the orientation to Landscape in the Activity tag in the Manifest, however now I need to make it portrait. For some reason when I force the orientation portrait the SurfaceView isnt created. I tested the layout by just using a single FrameLayout and inside that a single instance of my SurfaceView class but still, it wouldnt create properly.p  pThe error I get depends on what the first instance to the Thread within the SurfaceView is. Normally its my UI thread in onCreate requesting a handle to the thread which causes a NullPointerException.p  pAny ideas why my code works in landscape but not portrait Also it has the same issue if I dont select the orientation and then rotate it from landscape to portrait.p  pEDIT Heres my layoutp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout

Negative 868 pThere is no doubt that MonoTouch is one of the great crosscompilers. Similarly, SenchaTouch is one of the great HTML 5 Web App Kit.p  pI know a little about both of them however i made a very small application using MonoTouch for iPad, certainly MonoTouch and particularly with supporting XCode is awesome. But i did not tried SenchaTouchp  pThe advantage of using MonoTouch is that you can write c consequently i really enjoy it owing to the fact that i am a c developer In contrast a disadvantage of SenchaTouch for me is Java language and i really did not find any IDE like visual studio or xcode to DragampDrop UIs and it generate the Xml Codep  pMany are in this view that on account of the fact that MonoTouch is a CrossCompiler Consequently the applications developed by MonoTouch is not as fast as others like SenchaTouch .p  pI am really looking for a good advise from you, Your advise is welcome here.p  pRegards, S.

Negative 868 pI have a table in my database containing records of friendships.  There are two columns in the table user1id, and user2id, indicating that user1 is friends with user2. It is set up so user1id is always lt user2id. Im trying to write a query to return pairs of users sorted by number of mutual friends.

Negative 868 pIve got an irritating closedsource tool which writes specific information into its configuration file. If you then try to use the configuration on a different file, then it loads the old file. Grrr...p  pLuckily, the configuration files are text, so I can version control them, and it turns out that if one just removes the offending line from the file, no harm is done.p  pBut the tool keeps putting the lines back in. So every time I want to check in new versions of the config files, I have to remove all lines containing the symbol codeopenDirFilecode.p  pIm about to construct some sort of bash command to run grep v on each file, store the result in a temporary file, and then delete the original and rename the temporary, but I wondered if anyone knew of a nice clean solution, or had already concocted and debugged a similar invocation.p  pFor extra credit, how can this be done without destroying a symbolic link in the same directory favourite.rcsignals.rcp

Negative 868 pstrongCliffs Is there a known pattern for passing a standard filter type to a stored procedure to encapsulate stardateenddatepagesizepagenum parametersstrongp  pNot sure the correct place for this question. Im exploring the idea of passing a filtering object parameter to a stored procedure which encapsulates our common filtering parameters startdate, enddate, pagenumber, pagesize, list of ints, etc. The reason for this is to reduce the amount of similar parameters and boilerplate SQL spread around our procedures. This would give us a more standard interface and starting point for each procedure right from the start. I havent been able to find much info on the topic.p  pPattern Ive noticed  when first building most SPs they start with a single id parameter used in the where clause. At some point later, you may need to add parameters for date range parameters startdate, enddate or dynamic ranges ytd, mtd, dtd. If the data set is large enough you also may need to introduce pagesizepagenum for server side paging. After some time you may realize that you need results for a list of ids rather than a single id, so you add a CSV or XML parameter to envelope the IDs.p  pUltimately many stored procedures end up with a lot of similar boilerplate and hopefully identical parameters for handling these standard filtering parameters. Im trying to research known patterns for passing an encapsulated filter object parameter to my procedures, that ideally would be strongly typed on the C side. This would be particularly useful when managing a group of procedures that power reports which all require the same filtering options in addition to the reportspecific query parameters.p  pMy goal is to reduce the number of parameters required to the bare minimum needed for the WHERE clause, and create a standard mechanism for passing the generic filtering options into a procedure and using those values while inside a procedure. How could this be achieved through XML or CLR or UDT parameters p  pFor context of this question, Im using SQL Server 2008 via ADO.Net from C 2.0. Unfortunately LINQEF is not an option for this project at this point, and we must stick with our existing RDBMS. If there is a known pattern that requires changing technologies I would be interested in hearing about it. p  pstrongEditstrong Appreciate the replies so far.

Negative 868 pI have a requirement in which the user can select an image from codecamera rollcode and my application needs to optimize the image and upload it to a server. I am using codeALAssetscode library and a custom picker for the user to select a photo from codecamera rollcode. I am able to achieve this perfectly but have a problem with the file size getting increased.  p  pThe problem is as followsbr When the user selects a photo, of 1.7MB That is the full size as reported by the codeiOScode when I try to mail the photo, when I directly get the bytes from the codeALAssetRepresentationcode of that codeALAssetcode and convert it to codeNSDatacode the size of data is 1.7MB too. But, when I get a UIImage from the codeALAssetRepresentationcode using the following code..  p  pUIImage selImage  [UIImage imageWithCGImage[assetRepresentation fullResolutionImage] scale[assetRepresentation scale] orientation[assetRepresentation orientation]]p  pand converting the codeUIImagecode to codeNSDatacode using codeUIImageJPEGRepresentationcode with compression quality  1.0f, the NSData size becomes almost double the original size 3.2MB.p  pShouldnt it ideally be 1.7MB onlyp  pAs expected, when I save it to a file, the file size still says 3.2MB I checked it using xcode 4.2 by importing the sandbox apps documents folder. But the interesting thing is when I open the file with codePreviewcode on my mac, and check for the byte size, it says 1.7MB was 3.2 MB which is pretty confusing.. p  pPlease help..p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 868 pI noticed a weird problem in C and its been bothering my head for weeks, so I thought I just put this question out there. So my question is basically how does C handle multiple client codeltformgtcodes inside the server form codeltform runatservergtcode Ive been writing a web site and Ive encountered a very strange problem.  p  pSo heres the essential breakdown to recreate this problem. p  p1 Have a simple javascript method with an alert inside that fires if it is called.p  precode eg   function tester           alertadf         codepre  p2 Open a brand new Web Forms project in Visual Studios 2010. It should have a codeltform runatservergtcode already created inside for you.p  precode  eg ltform runatservergt ltformgt      You can only have one of these. codepre  p3 Now inside this form tag, write an empty form tag that should theoretically do nothingp  precode  eg ltform actiongtltformgt codepre  p4 Now Create another form right after this form that calls the javascript method.p  precode  eg ltform actionjavascripttester gt        ltbutton typesubmit gtSearchltbuttongt         ltformgt codepre  p5 Run this code now, and you should see the alert pop up after you press the button.p  p6 Now take out the empty form tags       Delete   codeltform actiongtltformgtcodep  p7 Run code again, and now you should find that your javascript call is not firing anymore, and it would rather be refreshing the page every time you press the button.p  pSo this is my problem that has been bothering me, and I hope some guru may have an answer for me soon, for this has been bothering my head for a long time. I have no idea why it works with two forms, and why it doesnt with just one form. Hope someone can answer this soon.

Negative 868 pI have a web app at mmatakedown.net. Its basically a social game, fantasy sportsesque, where you predict fight outcomes and score points and perks for getting them correct, with a leaderboard, etc.p  pRight now, I have a page I wrote to administer results.  What Id like to do is use cron job or a better option to check twitter periodically on the day of a fight card and look for tweets that note the results of the fights. from more trusted accounts to start, perhaps. For example, it might know that a card locked today, and that the deadline is passed, so its time to start searching for results. If two fighters were named Brooks and Jones, for example, it might look for something like   Jones def. or Brooks def. to find out who the victor was, then search for something like sub or ko or dec to find out the method of victory.p  pOnce it tallies a certain  of tweets to confirm the result, it would update the DB with the result, then set off a series of updates and notifications based on the result, who picked what, what scores were updated, any milestones reached, etc.p  pWhat would be the best approach for this  I write the site w PHPmysqlajaxjquery presently.p

Negative 868 pWe have a Web application that dynamically builds elements via JS.  We are testing for mobile usability and are finding that on devices that run 2.3.x versions of Android, our select element behavior is a little strange.  A touch on the select element will bring up the usual radio button list of the options and touching an option will select it and return to the page view.  However, the option shown in the select box does not update.  It still shows the top element in the option list.  When the page is reloaded, the behavior is normal.  I have tried adding an additional empty element at the top of the list and setting it as selected when the element is built, which seems to clear up the issue on some devices, but our QA tester is saying that behavior remains on others.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 868 pdo you have guys any experience with way how modern scalable reservation systems works  e.g. airports or transport agencies p  pWe just found serious flaw in reservation system of our customer. They reserve seat for each user which search for travel connection. That means if transport capacity is e.g. 200 and there is 200 people searching for the same trip all those got reservationwith timeout e.g. 5minutes so if there is marketing event and  thousands of people go on the site they actually cant see most searched trips because other users prereserved that already. This is not scalable. p  pI cant believe it works this way but thats real app architecture. How you would ideally handle reservation situations  p  pTo make it more complicated, from the number of prereserved seats price is computed and so its different for each user price changes as seats reservation changes.p  pFor sure we will try to rip off that prereservation step, but then some people will be refused in the last step before booking so that will be disadvantage...p

Negative 868 pWhat to do if you would like to filter by the mathematical value For examplep  pTheres a column with numbers, but their cell formatting differs. Some cells are on General, some others on Number. For a value like strong3strong, depending on the formatting, AutoFilter will recognize the different formats separately  so there will be one entry for strong3strong, one for strong3.0strong, etc. emFiltering for 3 wont match those with 3.0 and vice versa.em p  pIs changing the cell formatting is the only workaround for this issuep

Negative 868 pIm using a custom adapter for a GridView, and feeding it an ArrayList of my custom data class.p  pThe idea is, when the user presses  on an item, its number goes up, and when they press , it goes down.p  pThis has worked perfect with the following codep  pActivityp  precodeplayerLayouts is the ArrayList of my Player class. playerLayouts.getposition.changeLife1 All this does is decrement life by 1. adapter.notifyDataSetChanged codepre  pAdapterp  precodeholder.textLife  TextView row.findViewByIdR.id.player.textlife ... holder.textLife.setTextInteger.toStringplayer.life codepre  pSo this works great.

Also, Im using NineOldAndroids. textLifeChange.setTextInteger.toStringplayer.lifeChange animateholder.textLifeChange.setDuration2000.alpha0 There are a few more animations in addition to this one. codepre  pBasically, whenever the animation is playing which is a full two seconds, the view doesnt do any more updates. p  pFor example, say life  20. I hit , and now it says 19, and my little popup shows 1 and fades out. Then, just ONE second later, I hit 1 again. Nothing happens. The life TextView still says 19, and the popup just keeps playing its animation with no change. So I wait another second, and the animation is finished. NOW if I press  again, it updates properly again.p  pInterestingly, if I log my codesetTextcode method, I see that emit isem updating with the correct number, and codegetViewcode is being called, but its just.. not updating visibly.p  pWhats wrongp

This is because of my update functiontrigger on the partition.  Is there any way to get this to work as it would in Oracle with a merge i.e. if row found, update it, else insert it without causing dupes or having it fail on a constraint violationp  pYour help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 868 pThe property could be described like so strongif the action gets cancelled, its handler is guaranteed to be executed with an errorstrong.p  pFor example, the a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1520dochtmlboostasioreferencedeadlinetimer.html relnofollowboostasiodeadlinetimera doesnt have this property as described in the a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1520dochtmlboostasioreferencebasicdeadlinetimercanceloverload1.html relnofollowRemarks section of documentation for deadlinetimercancel functiona. So it is possible that even though one cancels a waiting operation on a timer, its callback gets executed without an error.p  pOn the other hand, the property holds for asio sockets at least I hope so  as there are no such remarks in the documentation.p  pEDIT A pseudocode demonstrating the lack of this property in deadline timersp  precode1 User calls timer.asyncwait with a handler H which is to be    executed when the action finishes. 2 Time passes. 3 Timeout has been reached, asio internally inserts the handler H into    a queue for later execution, but with error code indicating success.    User is unaware of when this step takes place. 4 User calls cancel on the timer, thus would expect the handler to be    executed with an error code indicating failure. 5 Asio takes the handler H from the queue and executes it with error    code indicating success as set in the step 3. codepre  pIt is easy to work around this problem by just setting a boolean flag in step 4 and then check it in step 5, so that is not the issue.p

If i try to trigger a click usingp  precode.fancybox.triggermousedown codepre  pi get nothing It just doesnt work.p  pThe reason i need to do this is because the images are being printed out with PHP in a gallery with thumbnails etc. I only want a dropdown of the available galleries, so on page load, i hide all of the thumbnails and then loop through them and create a dropdown menu containing all the galleries. So far so good If i show the element using the inspector using chrome and then manually click on it, it works fine Although, the problem is, when i try to trigger the click using the dropdown, nothing happensp  pI have it set up so that every codeltoptiongtcode in the dropdown has a data attribute of the gallerythumbnail ID, and when the dropdown changes when you select an option, it automatically finds the correct image, and triggers a click  which in turn should open a fancybox. I know it finds the correct image, and clicks it, its just that nothing happens when its clicked.p  pTry itp  pURL a hrefhttpgoo.glr4Klf relnofollowhttpgoo.glr4Klfap  pRightclick on the first dropdown menu in the content, and inspect it. Above it, youll see a bunch of code.ngggalleryoverviewcode elements. Click on one of them and remove all the styling applied to the element in element.style, the style basically hides the element. Then expand the element, and in there youll see a code.ngggallerythumbnailcode. Remove codedisplay nonecode from the styling. You should now be able to see the element on the page. If you try clicking it, the fancybox will open. However, if you try to click it using codethe element.triggermousedowncode, its not going to work.

Negative 868 pI recently started programming in PHP. For exercise Id like to build my own PHP text strategy game.

In example you gain 100 grain a hour and that grain is stored in the warehouse. This means that every 0.6 minute, 1 grain has to be added.

Negative 868 pI have 5 UITextFields in my View, When I tap on text fields keyboard opens up. From 3rd text field onwards the keyboard is hiding the text fields. So I am changing the self.view.frame.origin.y to negative value so that the veiw will move up and my text field will be visible. It is working fine till here. In the the screen once the View goes up on tapping of 3rd field, if I tap on 4th field instead of tapping the close keyboard or return key board buttons. Usually the 3rd text fields TextFieldDidEndEditing should get called and then the 4th fields TextFieldShouldBeginEditing should get called. But is is not happening in my case, it is happening like 4th fields begin editing is getting called first and then 3rd fields did end is getting called. Can any one help me, why the delegate methods are not getting called in proper order.p

Negative 868 pI am using boto 2.8.0 to create EMR jobflows over large log file stored in S3.  I am relatively new to Elastic Mapreduce and am getting the feel for how to properly handle jobflows from this issue.p  pThe logfiles in question are stored in s3 with keys that correspond to the dates they are emitted from the logging server, eg code20130301access.logcode.  These files are emvery, very largeem.  My mapreduce job runs an Apache Pig script that simply examines some of the uri paths stored in the log files and outputs generalized counts that correspond to our business logic.p  pMy client code in boto takes date times as input on cli and schedules a jobflow with a codePigStepcode instance for every date needed.  Thus, passing something like codepython script.py 20130201 20130301code would iterate over 29 days worth of datetime objects and create pigsteps with the respective input keys for s3.  This means that the resulting jobflow could have many, many steps, one for each day in the timedelta between the codefromdatecode and codetodatecode.p  pMy problem is that my EMR jobflow is exceedingly slow, almost absurdly so.  Its been running for a night now and hasnt made it even halfway through that example set.  Is there something wrong I am doing creating many jobflow steps like this  Should I attempt to generalize the pig script for the different keys instead, rather than preprocessing it in the client code and creating a step for each date  Is this a feasible place to look for an optimization on Elastic Mapreduce  Its worth mentioning that a similar job for a months worth of comparable data passed to the AWS codeelasticmapreducecode cli ruby client took about 15 minutes to execute this job was fueled by the same pig script.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pNeglected to mention, job was scheduled for two instances of type m1.small, which admittedly may in itself be the problem.p

Negative 868 pIm trying to use Qt with C to build a basic IM client for a school networking project. Im new to Qt and have only had one semester at C but over 4 of programming in general, 2 of C, one of C and one of scripting in Nix environments, but feel like Qt will be the best for me to use considering the documentation it has as well as the networking and GUI support it has. Im attempting to get the basic functionality of the server and client down. I have designed a simple message passing system between the server and client to do things like sending a message to a client, registering as an online user, and going offline as well, but before I start working on the project at a higher level, I want to make sure that I can rely on this underlying message passing to behave correctly. And Im having trouble. As of now, I get the two connected, the server hears the client, acts correctly and sends back a response message. Then the client responds to the acknowledgement and sends a username. The server registers the username and returns another acknowledgement. My issues is that while the server thinks its sent the ack, the client never gets it. p  pThis is the readyRead slot of the server only up through the area Ive tested, there are other commands I test for, but I havent started testing those yet. p  precodevoid mythreadreadyRead  this will change QMutex lock int flag0 Data dData QLinkedListltUsergtiterator Uit QStringiterator it User temp QByteArray stuff  socketgtreadAll qDebug ltlt stuff QString stuffText stuffText.clear  qDebug ltlt socketDescriptor ltlt Data in  ltlt stuff    connect new client REG command if stuff  REGn client would like to register. next message should be username need to add check to see if user exists     socketgtwriteACK this is a hard ack that tells the client that it may write to the socket and be heard by the server.     stuff.clear verify that buffer is cleared.     socketgtwaitForReadyRead     stuffsocketgtreadAllshould have username followed by n     stuffText  stuff move it to a string so that I can manually remove the n and then add it to the users list.     stuffText.removen hopefully removes the n     now to add to the user list, completing the register process.     temp.setNamestuffText     temp.setDescriptorthisgtsocketDescriptortemp user configured. time to add     lock.lock     users.appendtemp     lock.unlock     clean up     stuff.clear     stuffText.clear     temp.clear     stuffACK     int ans     socketgtflush     ans  socketgtwriteACK     ifans1                      qDebugltlt ans ltlt Didnt work. client can send data again.              else qDebugltlt ans ltltwrote the ack.     client has been added to the list. waiting for other data.  codepre  pThis is the client side.p  precodevoid socketConnect  Socket1  new QTcpSocket QByteArray stuff Socket1gtconnectToHostlocalhost,8060  ifSocket1gtwaitForConnected3000      qDebug ltlt Connected     Socket1gtwriteREGn     Socket1gtwaitForBytesWritten1000 big times for testing     Socket1gtwaitForReadyRead3000     qDebug ltlt Reading ltlt Socket1gtbytesAvailable     stuff  Socket1gtreadAll     qDebug ltlt stuff     ifstuffACK              Socket1gtwriteSeann         Socket1gtwaitForReadyRead3000         ifSocket1gtbytesAvailable                     stuff  this to test if reading is changing value at all.             stuff  Socket1gtreadAll             qDebug ltlt stuff             ifstuffACK                             qDebug ltlt got second ack good                              else qDebug ltlt Didnt get anything.          else Socket1gtclose      Socket1gtclose   else      qDebug ltltNot connected    codepre  pI know theres a lot of code here, and if I had any idea how to narrow it down, I would.

Negative 868 pI have an codeEmbeddablecode class that uses property access to wrap another object thats not directly mappable by JPA via field access. It looks like thisp  precodeEmbeddable AccessAccessType.PROPERTY public class MyWrapper       NotNull     Transient     private WrappedType wrappedField      protected MyWrapper            public MyWrapperWrappedType wrappedField          this.wrappedField  wrappedField           Transient     public WrappedType getWrappedField          return wrappedField           public void setWrappedFieldWrappedType wrappedField          this.wrappedField  wrappedField           Columnname  wrappedTypeColumn     protected String getJPARepresentation          return wrappedField.toString           protected void setJPARepresentationString jpaRepresentation          wrappedField  new WrappedTypejpaRepresentation       codepre  pPersisting an codeEntitycode with a codeMyWrappercode field works fine. But when I execute a query to load the Entity from the database, I get a codeNullPointerExceptioncode. The stacktrace and some debugging shows that Eclipselink creates a new instance of codeMyWrappercode by calling its default constructor and then calls the codesetJPARepresentationcode method as expected.p  pBut now the unexpected happens the stacktrace shows that the codegetJPARepresentationcode is called from inside the setter, which then of course leads to a codeNullPointerExceptioncode when return codewrappedField.toStringcode is executed.p  precodejava.lang.NullPointerException     at MyWrapper.getJPARepresentationMyWrapper.java27     at MyWrapper.setJPARepresentationMyWrapper.java     ... 109 more codepre  pFact is, there is obviously no call to the getter in the code and the stacktrace shows no line number indicating from where in the setter called the getter. So my conclusion would be, that the bytecode weaver of Eclipselink generated the call to the getter.p  pIts easy to build a workaround, but strongmy question is Why does Eclipselink do thatstrongp  pP.S Im using EclipseLink 2.3.2.v20111125r10461 in a GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.1.2 build 23p

Negative 868 pIm developing a Java REST API that uses client data from a postgreSQL database. p  pstrongThe numbersstrong  . About 600 clients at the beginning . Some of them doing requests every few secondsp  pBecause clients pay per request, we need to control if their number of successful requests reach their limit, and as querying postgresql data update the value of hitsCounter field after every request is bad in terms of performance, we are thinking about implementing a cache system with redis.p  pstrongThe ideastrong  After a client does his first request, we retrieve his data from postgresql and store it into redis cache. Then work with this cachedata, for example incrementing the hitsCounter key value, till the client stops doing requests. strongIn parallel, every few minutes a background process persist data from redis cache to db tables, so at the end we have the updated data back to postgresql, and we can deal with them in the future.strongp  pI think it obviously increase performance, but Im not sure about this background process. An option is to check the TTL of the cache elements and if its minor than some value it means client has finished doing requests, persist the data.p  pI would love to hear some opinions about this. Is this a good idea Do you know some better alternativesp

Negative 868 pI want to make a codeTreeViewcode like that in a hrefhttpsdemo.erpnext.comapp.htmlAccounts20BrowserAccount relnofollowERPNexta in codeASP.Net webformscode. Note that when a user clicks on any link codeedit,add,delete and renamecode appears in front of it. I could not add button like that and fire its event Is it possible with simple codeTreeviewcode or it is any other controlp  pIf possible, If you have an example or link please provide me. Hint might be enough.p
Negative 868 pI am working on a Desktop application using JavaFX 2.2. I have an application class which loads the main fxml. In that main fxml i had a Border pane and in the center part, i had included a child fxml, using codeltfxincludegtcode. My problem is that, the child fxmls controller initialize method is getting called before the parent controllers. I need to get the parent to be initialized when its loaded in the application class. I dont know whether its the actual or behavior or i need to do something else to get it works done.

Negative 868 pWhen we need to do database access in our application, we use the following patternsp  ul liFor querying, we have a static factory class with a method codeCreateOpenConnectioncode which does nothing more than codenew SqlConnectionmyConnectionStringcode and calls codeOpencode on it. This method gets called before we do a query and the connection is disposed after the query returns.li liFor insertsupdatesdeletes we use a Unit of Work pattern where the changes are batched up and submitted to the database with a call to codework.Commitcode like soli ul  pwork.Commitp  precodeusing var tranScope  new TransactionScopeTransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew      using var conn  DapperFactory.CreateOpenConnection            var count  changeTracker.CommitChangesconn        tranScope.Complete        return count       codepre  pThis seems to work great for general usage as part of a webservice, but is currently giving me MSDTC trouble when I try to use this in combination with Rebus. p  pFrom what I can tell, Rebus when it handles a message in the queue creates a new codeTransactionScopecode so that in case of a failure to handle the message, stuff can be rolled back. Now, this in itself has worked fine so far. I can open a new codeSqlConnectioncode inside a Rebus message handler without any issues however, using our legacy Entity Framework queries emandem manual SqlConnections inside the same Rebus codeTransactionScopecode doesnt work, but I dont consider that an issue right now. But yesterday I asked the following questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16837668serialprocessingofacertainmessagetypeinrebus1684393816843938Serial processing of a certain message type in Rebusap  pTo which the answer seems to be to use the saga feature of Rebus. I tried implementing this and configured it so that the Rebus saga gets persisted to a new SQL Server database with a distinct connection string. Presumably, using that SQL Server persistence opens a codeSqlConnectioncode of its own, because any time I try to create a codeSqlConnectioncode now, I get the following exceptionp  blockquote   pNetwork access for Distributed Transaction Manager MSDTC has been disabled. Please enable DTC for network access in the security configuration for MSDTC using the Component Services Administrative tool.p blockquote  pEnabling MSDTC is something I would very, emveryem much like to avoid doing, with regards to configuration and performance overhead. And I may be wrong, but it also just doesnt seem necessary. p  pWhat I presume is happening here is that Rebus creates an ambient codeTransactionScopecode and that the codeSqlConnectioncode it creates enlists to that scope. And when I try to create my own codeSqlConnectioncode it also tries to enlist to that ambient scope and because multiple connections are involved, it gets promoted to MSDTC, which fails. p  pI have an idea on how to fix this, but I dont know if its the right thing to do. What I would do isp  ul liAdd codeEnlistfalsecode to my applications connection string so that it never enlists to ambient transactions.li liModify the codeCommitcode method so that it doesnt create a new codeTransactionScopecode which my connection wont subscribe to any more because I just told that it shouldnt but that it uses codeconn.BeginTransactioncode.li ul  pLike sop  precodevar transaction  conn.BeginTransaction  try    var count  changeTracker.CommitChangesconn   transaction.Commit   return count  catch    transaction.Rollback   throw  finally    transaction.Dispose  codepre  pIm just not sure if this is the right approach and what the possible drawbacks are. p  pAny tipsp  pstrongUPDATEstrong To clarify, its not the codework.Commitcode thats been giving me problems, Im quite sure that it would work, but I never get there because my emqueryingem is what fails. p  pAn example of what failsp  precodepublic int GetWarehouseIDint appID    var query   select top 1 ID from OrganizationUnits o where TypeID amp 16  16  warehouse     using var conn  dapper.OpenConnection        var id  conn.Queryltintgtquery.FirstOrDefault      return id     codepre  pThis gets called when a codeTransactionScopecode has been created by Rebus, as well as after a codeSqlConnectioncode is opened by Rebus.

Negative 868 pOkay, I know this is a common problem with downloading Android Studio in Windows, but after I downloaded and opened Android Studio I got the error message No JVM installation found.  Please intall a 64bit JDK.  If you already have a JDK installed, define a JAVAHOME variable in Computer  System Properties  System Settings  Environment Variables.... So I did this, or at least I think I did.  I typed Environment Variables into the Start Task Manager and opened it up.  Then I added the JAVAHOME variable with the path, CProgram Files x86Javajdk1.7.021...all the examples I see have Program Files, instead of Program Files x86...I know the difference, just wanted to tell you everything.  Anyway, after I did that, it still showed the error and didnt work.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 868 pIn my app, I have an alarm set that when run, launches a service that will perform a task in my app, it is sending a text message without user interaction.  This message can be set for 2 hours in the future, or a year in the future.  Here is how I implement it.p  pstrongIn my main activitystrongp  puser types message, choses a date and time translated to milliseconds, and that alarm time the milliseconds, is saved persistently.  I then call a service, which i have set to be sticky, and boot on startup.  p  pstrongIn my service.strongp  pWhen the service gets called Which after the first time you schedule a message, it is now running, all the time, it creates the alarm with the saved alarm time.  This is good, because if the phone reboots, the alarm will get recreated again.p  pstrongHere is the problemstrongp  pAfter the alarm time has passed, and the message is successfully sent, I dont see a way to shut down that service from always running.  So as soon as the service gets killed and restarted like when the phone reboots, it launches, sees the alarm time is in the past, and immediately launches the service that sends the message. So until I clear data on the app, I get random duplicate messages sent out, at random future times.p  pstrongMy solution not elegant.strongp  pAfter the message sends the first time, i add 50 years in milliseconds, to the alarm time, and resave it persistently.  This way it wont trigger again until the user actually sets the time themselves.  This seems to have worked, but IMO is a terrible solution. p  pstrongThere has to be a more proper way of setting a persistent alarm to only run once.  Can someone who has more experience with AlarmManager advise mestrongp

Negative 868 pI am developing an application that can establish a serverclient connection using QTcpp  pThe client sends the server a number.p  pThe received string is checked on its length and quality is it really a numberp  pIf everything is OK, then the server replies back with a file path which depends on the sent number.p  pThe client checks if the file exists and if it is a valid image. If the file complies with the rules, it executes a command strongonstrong the file.p  pWhat security concerns exist on this type of connectionp  pThe program is designed for Linux systems and the external command strongonstrong the image file is executed using QProcess. If the string sent contained something like do not run the following commandp  precode rm rf  codepre  pthen it would be blocked on the file not found security check because it isnt a file path. If there wasnt any check about the validity of the sent string then the following command would be executedp  precodecommandtorunonimage  rm rf  codepre  pwhich would cause panic But this cannot happen.p  pSo, is there anything I should take into considerationp

Negative 868 pI have been looking at Angular.js and Knockout.js as potential front end solutions. I love Knockouts tutorials and documentation. However, it is not clear to me how Knockout handles templating larger applications.p  pFor example in Angular, you would make a main template like thisp  precodeltdiv idcontent classcontainer ngviewgtltdivgt codepre  pAnd then this would be populated by by the partials, for examplep  precodeltpgtThis is a partialltpgt codepre  pMy question is, does Knockout support the same concept It appears that Knockout wants to use the foreach template a hrefhttpknockoutjs.comdocumentationtemplatebinding.html relnofollowhttpknockoutjs.comdocumentationtemplatebinding.htmla. However, that does not address breaking the HTML down into smaller segments.p  pAm I on the right track here Is there something I am missing in regards to Knockouts directory structurep  pstrongEDITstrong I have gotten some good feedback. My understanding is that Knockout does not have a templating solution built in. If this is true, then I will probably need Angular.p

Negative 868 pBasically I have two distinct services I wish to use my own WCF back end service and an Azure Mobile Service that both use push notifications.

Negative 868 pI am working in a team that is developing Android software.  Some team members use Windows, some use Macs, and I have been known to use Linux.  Everyone uses Eclipse.p  pEclipse writes a file called codeproject.propertiescode heres an example.  The important part is the last three lines, the android library reference paths.p  precode This file is automatically generated by Android Tools.

When Eclipse on Windows writes it, the library reference lines are written with backslashes.p  pOf course on Windows, backslashes are acceptable path separators.  But on Mac and Linux such paths do not work.  The thing is, on Windows, forward slashes work perfectly well.  So, our policy now is always to commit the file with forward slashes, so that it will work for everyone.p  pBut this is a pain for our Windows users, and its a pain for the rest of us when the Windows users make a mistake, so Im looking for a technical solution.  I have two ideasp  ul lipFind a setting somewhere in Eclipse on Windows, telling it to use forward slashes when saving paths in files like codeproject.propertiescode.  Why the heck isnt that the defaultpli lipWe use Mercurial, so install some sort of hooks that will solve the problem.p  ul liInstall a commit hook on the Windows computers, so that the file is committed into the repository with the backslashes replaced by forward slashes.li liInstall a pull hook on the Mac and Linux computers so if the file gets committed with backslashes, they get fixed up by the time the files are written.li ulli ul  pThe commit hook seems cleaner, so if both are available Id take a commit hook over a pull hook.p  pI found a Mercurial extension that edits tabs to spaces, which is at least sort of similar to what I want.  Its complex enough that Im a bit leery of trying to modify it into what I need.p  pa hrefhttpmercurial.selenic.comwikiCheckFilesExtensionhttpmercurial.selenic.comwikiCheckFilesExtensionap  pThe other strategy is to add a hook that detects backslashes in the paths, and simply aborts the commit, forcing the Windows user to fix the file by hand before committing.  That would be better than nothing.p

For my Nexus 7 which is 1280 x 800 pixels the TImage component which fills the entire screen, has a width of 601 and a height of 880. Thus, when I set the size of the Bitmap to be the size of my TImage, the Bitmap is also 601 x 880, which explains why I needed to scale the Bitmap to make it fill the entire screen. The screen size is reported as 600 x 905 using Screen.Size.p  pstrongMy question isstrong why is the size of the TImage component only 601 x 880 and the screen only 600 x 905 when the actual resolution of my device is 800 x 1280 If these sizes are not pixels, then what are they And more importantly, how do I convert from these numbers to actual screen pixels bear in mind, 1.34 only works for Nexus 7  on my HTC Sensation it needed to be even bigger p  pOne of my coworkers suggested that it might have to do with the DPI of the screen, but I couldnt find any method that will give me the DPI of the current device.p  pI have also tried updating the size of the bitmap in the FormResize procedure, but that doesnt make a difference.p

Negative 868 pI am making a toy programming language in c, but i have run into a problem.  I have noticed that in c a stack can only store one type of data.  I was wondering if there was an easy way to fix this problem, such as by storing in the stack a byte array of each object.  I was wondering if anyone knows how the jvm overcomes this issue.  The types i would need to store on the stack would be char, short, int, float, double, strings, arrays, and references to objects.  I understand that the jvm stack might be more of an abstraction, but if it is i would still like to know how they have accomplished it.  If it makes any difference, i am only planning to target windows computers.p
Negative 868 pI developed a C server application for embedded i386 compatible environment, so no cross compiler was needed.

Negative 868 pThis is really weird behavior that my website is displaying, but here is the description Ill describe it as best as possible, it is part of a much larger web based applicationp  pI have a page that lets the user create, read, update, delete filters for customers i.e. age, household size, etcp  pThe form is dynamically populated using ajax, which is effectively generated using knockouts foreach binding there are several of these forms generated based on the ajax request and the number of filters.p  pOne of the things that happens when a user is updating a filter is a bit of validation happens is the date a date, is the household size a number, etc, and then a save button and a cancel button are displayed.p  pBoth buttons are hidden by CSS initially, then when a filter is edited, both buttons are made visible and knockouts enable binding is used to enabledisable the save button depending on whether the validation passesfails, in realtime using knockout. we have server side validation too, but that does not relate to this issue.p  pThis all works fine in all browsers save for IE8 which is a must have supported browser for this web app for our client.p  pWhen validation fails in IE8, the save button is disabled as per usual, but it is still hidden from the page until the user moves his mouse a few pixels.p  precodeltdiv idfiltereditor classmenulist databindforeach filtersgt   ltform classforminline newfilterformgt     ltselect classinputmedium databindoptions root.fields, optionsText name, value attributegtltselectgt     ltselect classinputsmall databindoptions root.getFilteredOperatorsdata, optionsText symbol, optionsValue index, optionsCaption Choose..., value operatorgtltselectgt     ltinput typetext classinputsmall editable editing databindcss invalid isValid, value value,  valueUpdate [keyup]gt     ltspan databindcss hidden isDirtygt       ltbutton classbtn btnsmall btnsuccess titleSave changes databindenable isValid, click root.saveCondition.bindnull, parent, datagtSaveltbuttongtampnbsp       ltbutton classbtn btnsmall titleCancel changes databindclick root.cancelConditionEdit.bindnull, parent, datagtCancelltbuttongt     ltspangt   ltformgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe isValid method returns truefalse boolean, this then enablesdisables the button. I cannot see why the button would be hidden from view until the mouse moves. We have no mouseevents attached anywhere. Any suggestionsp  pEDIT I have had some success in getting the button to display in IE8 consistently. I added a css binding to the save button, and that forces the button to always display, regardless of whether it has a disabled or enabled attribute applied.p  precodeltbutton classbtn btnsmall btnsuccess titleSave changes databindcss blah blah, enable isValid, click root.saveCondition.bindnull, parent, datagtSaveltbuttongt codepre  pHowever, it appears that the CSS binding is just causing the DOM to update, even if I put nonsensical attributes and values in there.

Negative 868 pI have a model codeItemcode which has many tags using actsastaggableonp  pUsing sunspot, I search for items like sop  precodesearch  Item.search do   fulltext params[search]   paginate page params[page], perpage 20 end codepre  pThis works fine but, for the items returned from the search, I want to also be able to show a list of unique tags with a count of occurrences of each tag.p  pI want to be able to do something like thisp  precodeserch.results.tagcounts  codepre  pcodetagcountscode is a class method of codeItemcode added by actsastaggableonp  pThis would work fine if this was an ActiveRecord query, but obviously my search results have the class codeSunspotSearchPaginatedCollectioncode rather than codeItemcode or codeActiveRecordRelationActiveRecordRelationItemcode  which means my class methods are not accessible. p  pEven if I did have access to the codetagcountscode class method, this would only return the results for my paginated collection  it would only work for the first 20 items.p  pAny ideas about how to achieve this for all matching search resultsp

In the middle of them there is a JPasswordField requesting the key of the encription.p  pMy question is if there is a simple way of making the TextField not useable and half transparent, when the option to save encripted is not selected.

The following script is intended to select all points from one shapefile that are within the boundaries of a second polygon shapefile, then edit the number of points selected into one of the polygon fields.  I have not been able to get the where clause statement to function properly although from the error message it appears to be correct.

Negative 868 pI am working on a RFID based attendance monitoring system. I used Mifare 1k Classic as my RFID and ACR122u as my reader.

Both commands returns 0x90 SW1 which means it transmitted successfully. My problem is how to getretrieve the value stored to the VALUE BLOCK after reading it. E.g I Stored a value 15 from block 0x05.

Negative 868 pI am working on a custom camera Android app. It works fine with the preview screen fits nicely with the screen size on both portrait and landscape modes. However, when changing phone orientation, there is a noticeable delay in preview redraw. Searching through the forums I came across others seeing similar issues when dealing with phone orientation change.

Skip down to the bottom if you dont want to read all of the overhead.emstrongp  h2Overheadh2  pMy company has a project coming up which requires the use of frontend technologies to accomplish what I would otherwise prefer to do with PHP.p  pWe looked into a few different emJavaScriptem frameworks, and the solution that we agreed upon was emEmber.jsem.p  pI followed the emTodoMVCem tutorial on their website, and learned the very basics.p  pWith this project, we will be using an AJAX request to pull in our data at the start of the application, and then put everything into fixtures.p  pIm having difficulty figuring out how to pass multiple fixtures into my template at the same time. I started with adding two fixtures. Here are their data and definitionsp  precodeApp.Students  DS.Model.extend     first DS.attrstring,     last DS.attrstring,     classes DS.hasManyClassGroup   App.ClassGroup  DS.Model.extend     className DS.attrstring,     isActive DS.attrnumber,     students DS.hasManyStudents, async true    App.ClassGroup.FIXTURES  [              id 1,         className Class 1,         isActive 1,         students [1, 2]     ,              id 2,         className Class 2,         isActive 0,         students [2]      ]  App.Students.FIXTURES  [              id 1,         first Student,         last One,         classes [1]     ,              id 2,         first Student,         last Two,         classes [1, 2]      ] codepre  pThis is just a very simple implementation.

For example, by passing emClassGroupem via the router, I am unable to access the emStudentsem fixture by itself I must first loop through emClassGroupem, and from there, access a student.p  pLikewise, if I change my router to pass in the students fixture, I can loop through the students, and then jump to the classes via a nested each statement, but I lose the ability to simply loop through a list of all classes.p  pIs there a way that I can pass all of my fixtures into the template Am I going about this the right wayp  h2The Long Story Shorth2  pHow can I pass strongALLstrong of my fixtures into the template at once, in such a way that I can access my students array or my classes array How can I access said fixture data i.e., if I want to display the first name of the student with ID 2, represented as students[2][first] in a language like PHP, how can this be done with handlebarsp

Negative 868 pGetting started using djangorestframework, and Im having some trouble regarding validation.p  pI have a basic model, and ive applied validators to a copple of its fields A regular codeMaxLengthValidatorcode and a custom codeRegexValidatorcode, ending up with something like thisp  precodeclass ZipCodeValidatorRegexValidator     regex  [09]5     message  uInvalid ZipCode.   class UserAbstractUser, BaseUser          Custom user model            ... other fields ...     zipcode  models.CharField         maxlength5, blankTrue, validators[ZipCodeValidator]          description  models.TextField         nullTrue, blankTrue, maxlength1000, validators[MaxLengthValidator1000]      codepre  pI then created a codeModelSerializercode mapped to this model, with a few additional fields and methods. This is all served by a very simple RetrieveUpdateAPIView.p  pIm noticing that the validators are not called i can enter anything in the zipcode field, or exceed 1000 characters for the description.p  pQuick and dirty solution has been to override the two fields at the serializer level and assigne them the validator therep  precodeclass UserSerializerserializers.ModelSerializer     zipcode  serializers.WritableField         sourcezipcode, requiredFalse, validators[ZipCodeValidator]          description  serializers.WritableField         sourcedescription, requiredFalse, validators[MaxLengthValidator1000]      codepre  pThis works fine, but i dont like it much. Id rather have this validation occur at the model level to be safer i wouldnt having mind custom or additional validation on the serializer, but those rules will need to be enforced in all cases. Since serializers work a lot like django forms, i expected them to call the models codecleancode amp cie method before saving them, but a quick look at the a hrefhttpsgithub.comtomchristiedjangorestframeworkblobmasterrestframeworkmixins.pyL111sourcea seems to indicate it does not.p  pThis is a bit annoying, it forces me to duplicate much of the fields code if I want to ensure the validation always happens, and id rather keep this as DRY as possible.p  pI might be missing something, but is there a nice and clean way to ensure those validators will be run by the serializer before updating the model p  pemEDITem Doubled checked the source, turns out that the instances codefullcleancode method is indeed called by the view before saving it to the db, which in turns ends up running the models validator. Still lost as to why those dont seem to run, tho.p

Negative 868 pI want to preface this by saying Im an absolute programming beginner, so please excuse how basic this question is. p  pIm trying to get a better understanding of atomic classes in R and maybe this goes for classes in programming in general. I understand the difference between a character, logical, and complex data classes, but Im struggling to find the fundamental difference between a numeric class and an integer class. p  pLets say I have a simple vector codex lt c4, 5, 6, 6code of integers, it would make sense for this to be an integer class. But when I do codeclassxcode I get code[1] numericcode. Then if I convert this vector to an integer class codex lt as.integerxcode. It return the same exact list of numbers except the class is different. p  pMy question is why is this the case, and why the default class for a set of integers is a numeric class, and what are the advantages and or disadvantages of having an integer set as numeric instead of integer. p

Negative 868 pIm after a feature in intellij that allows me to allocate a shortcut to a line say line number 55 then go somewhere else in the same file and hit the shortcut then IDE shows me the line 55.

Negative 868 pI have a large data.table about 24000 rows and growing.

Negative 868 pSpontaneously the answer is of course no, so to understand what Im getting at please let me explain.p  pWe have a service into which the client codePOSTcodes jobs that are to be executed, but they are not executed at the time of the post. Instead our service responds with an ID which the client may use to execute the codejobcode via a codeGETcode.p  pNow when the job is executed, it is also removed and that job is no longer available. p  pFrom my understanding of what a RESTfull architecture is, our implementation does not comply to the ideas of REST. p  pSo what Im wondering is, if were not RESTfull how should we redesign so that we are Is it just a matter of changing our codeGETcode to codePOSTcode which i dont believe, since were removing something the job at the same time a codeDELETEcode also seems weird since were executing a codejobcodep  pwith codejobcode I mean that were providing a possibly huge amount of data from our DBs.p

Unfortunately there is no source code nor enough details on how some very lowlevel details work.p  pFor example they state that codemmapcodeping the executable of a process P1 in the virtual space of another process P2 makes the kernel supposedly merge the code.textcode segment of P1 with the same code.textcode segment that has been codemmapcodeped by P1 at the physical memory level which to P2, of course, is just random data in memory, not an actual code.textcode segment. But how can I make sure this actually happensp  pLets take address codeacode in P1s code.textcode. Its content in P2s virtual space will be at address codeacode belonging to the codemmapcodeped space with codeacode  codeacode obviously, even though they should both point to the same address in the physical memory. If I codeclflushcode codeacode how can I make sure Im also flushing codeacode since the cache is mapped to the physical memory In other words is there a way to know whether or not Linux has merged the two pages referred by codeacode and codeacodep  pThank you in advance.p  pPS I know you cant translate a virtual address into a physical address in user space but I cant write a driver or anything like that.p  pPPS this is the excerpt of the paper that describes the codemmapcodeping phase section 4p  pcodeThe spy and the victim execute as two processes within that system. To achieve sharing, the spy mmaps the victims executable file into the spys virtual address space. As the Linux loader maps executable files into the process when executing them, the spy and the victim share the memory image of the mapped file.codep

Negative 868 pIm trying to plot large numbers of points that have varying appearance shape, edge color, face, color, etc. and am finding that plotting the obvious way using codeplotcode for each point takes a very long time. I see various ways to improve performance, but find that these either reduce flexibility in point appearance, or end up being far more low level than seems correct to me.p  pFor example, if I havep  precodefig, ax  matplotlib.pyplot.subplots rands  numpy.random.randomsamplen, codepre  pwhere codencode is some large number, then using codeplotcode to plot each pointp  precodefor x in rangen     ax.plotx, rands[x], o, colorstrrands[x], mecstr1rands[x] codepre  ptakes a very long time and seems very inefficient. Much faster results can be achieved with by plotting many points at oncep  precodeax.plotrangen, rands, o, colorb, mecr codepre  pbut with a loss of control over many features of the individual points here, for example neither codecolorcode nor codemeccode can be a list, and many other aspects suffer the same limitation. Using convenience methods like codescattercode p  precodeax.scatterrangen, rands, markero, color[stry for y in rands] codepre  palso produces fast results but again at the loss of considerable flexibility though points can be colored individually, codeplotcodes remaining options for setting features of individual points are not supported and of some automatic axis limiting use of codesetxlimcode and codesetylimcode seem necessary to accomplish what codeplotcode does automatically.p  pFinally, I see many examples that use graphic elements like circles in conjunction with a hrefhttpmatplotlib.orgapicollectionsapi.html relnofollowcollectionsa which, while fast for common use cases, result in code that looks to low level to mep  precodepatches  [] colors   []  for x in rangen     circ  matplotlib.patches.Circlexfloatn, rands[x], .01     colors.append[rands[x],rands[x],rands[x]]     patches.appendcirc  collection  matplotlib.collections.PatchCollectionpatches collection.setfacecolorcolors collection.setedgecolor[[1h for h in c] for c in colors] ax.addcollectioncollection codepre  psince it not only embreaks the abstraction of plotting pointsem, but also requires considerable scaling and adjustment to restore even partially the appearance provided automatically by codeplotcode here for example codematplotlib.pyplot.axisequalcode is necessary to avoid distorted points. p  pThis is frustrating because codeplotcode seems the natural method to use as it provides all the right customization of individual points, and results in figures that are nicely scaled and with axes that are naturally bounded its just too slow when used a point at a time, and doesnt accept lists as arguments for most properties.p  pWhat is the correct Pythonic way to plot large numbers of points where features of each point marker, edge color, face color, alpha, size, etc. must potentially be customized Is using circles or other shapes and collections followed by scaling and other tweaking of the figure really the preferred or at least necessary approachp

So for examplep  pSuppose i got a bitmaparraylist of bitmaps bm0,bm1,bm2,bm3,bm4,bm5,bm6,bm7,bm8 and i set the tags 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 in my image adapter. if i shuffle this bitmap, how am i supposed to shuffle the imagetags with themp  pHere is the code of my imageAdapterp  precodeprivate ArrayListltBitmapgt crops private List ID private Context mContext  public ImageAdapterContext c, ArrayListltBitmapgt crops, List ID      mContext  c     this.crops  crops     this.ID  ID   public int getCount      return crops.size   public Object getItemint position      return null   public long getItemIdint position      return 0    public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent      ImageView imageView     if convertView  null    if its not recycled, initialize some attributes         imageView  new ImageViewmContext         imageView.setLayoutParamsnew GridView.LayoutParams85, 85         imageView.setScaleTypeImageView.ScaleType.CENTERCROP         imageView.setPadding8, 8, 8, 8      else          imageView  ImageView convertView           imageView.setImageBitmapcrops.getposition     imageView.setTagposition     return imageView  codepre  pp  pAs you can see the tags will always be the same, but that will cause problems. p  pAny hints tricks or tips on solving thisp  pPS I made a List ids but didnt do anything with it because i didnt know what to dop  pKeesp
Negative 868 pI have a very simple directive that does not have an isolate scope.  Its being used on a ngrepeat element and I want to limit which element out of that ngrepeat it works on.  It doesnt work on every element created by the ngrepeat.  So I have an attribute that evaluates an angular expression within the scope, but it appears that its not working.  I have a feeling this is because ngrepeat creates its own scope, but I think I dont have access to it.  Here is the directive codep  precodeApp.directivetestDriveStep, [log, functionlog    return      link function scope, element, attribs            this is the line that has trouble.         var enabled  attribs.testDriveEnabled  scope.evalattribs.testDriveEnabled  true         if enabled               enable the directive otherwise do nothing                  ] codepre  pHere is my code Im trying to executep  precodeltli ngrepeatitem in items testdrivestep testdriveenabledindex  0 ampamp item.band  band1gt codepre  pIf I remove the second part of the boolean expression in enabled attribute ie lesson.band  band1.  It works in that the evaluation evaluates correctly.  However, when I add the use of item it seems like item is undefined which makes me think the scope of directive isnt the same as ngrepeat.  What do I need to do to fix thisp

Negative 868 pI have had a MineOS setup using the prepackaged Turnkey bundle on a dedicated system and it worked at first, but recently the system kicked everyone off the server. Any attempt to reconnect give the message Authentication servers are down, try again later. and 4 days later, same issue.p  pFrom what I can tell this means that the server cant verify my user ID with Mojangs servers for some reason. I checked and there are no disruptions on Mojangs servers, so it must be my system. I tried disabling onlinemode and it said You are not whitelisted on this server. and still wouldnt let any one in. Im thinking this is an error in the firewall configuration but I dont know how or where to start with that. I have already verified that my router is not blocking access to Mojangs servers so it must be within my system configurations somewhere.p  pWhat confuses me is why it worked at first and then quit seemingly at random. Any thoughts on what is causing this and how to fix it thanks in advance for any assistancep

Negative 868 pI have a data grid that is created dynamically to display information retrieved from a database. The data grid consists of multiple bound columns and two button columns for each row, a view and a delete button. p  pClicking either button calls the PageLoad method with Page.IsPostBack as false. p  precode    if Page.IsPostBack                         this.bindForm  Populates drop down lists that the user can select              setAccessfalse  Sets access for the page            Stuff commented out to avoid confusion                             else              bindDynamicGrids  Create the data grids and populate them                    codepre  pSo when I first click the button the above code gets called with IsPostBack false, and the dynamic grids get bound. But, the button click event does not fire. When I click the button a second time, PageLoad is called with IsPostBack false, and after executing bindDynamicGrids the button click event is fired. I cannot understand the difference between the first and second click.  p  pI have read a few threads p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions297217aspnetcneedtopressabuttontwicetomakesomethinghappenASP.NET C, need to press a button twice to make something happenap  pa hrefhttpforums.asp.nett1783694.aspxASPNETButtonneedstobeclickedtwice relnofollowhttpforums.asp.nett1783694.aspxASPNETButtonneedstobeclickedtwiceap  pTo attempt to understand the issue, but I must be missing something. From what I am gathering from the second link, a session variable may be getting set in the click event, which is also being set in PageLoad, and this is all an issue with ordering. If that is the case I am not seeing where it is happening.p  pWhen it is not a post back the bindForm method is called, which populates all drop down lists. The edit click event populates those drop downs with the values from the row, but the click event is always a post back and the form has already been bound. p  pI have also considered having a script automatically double click one of the buttons anytime the user single clicks, but I have not been able to find an OnClick property for the column button. Any help that could be provided would be phenomenal. p

Negative 868 pIm trying to implement a simple server. The server uses nonblocking sockets and a thread pool to process each request. Currently Im using a monitor along with a event queue to handle incoming requests. Im having trouble with defining what my event should be  right now its a structurep  precodestruct eventQueueNode  int clientSocket void processClientvoid  arg   eventQueueNode next codepre  pp  pThe main thread puts those events into the queue whenever a socket is ready for read. A worker picks it up from the queue, reads the request from the socket, and sends the reply. p  pMy very basic protocol for this communication isp  pThe client sends to the server request of formp  precodeFETCH somedataname codepre  pFollowed by two newlines to indicate the end of transmission.  The server replies with desired data, followed by 2 newlines as well. p  pRight now all the processing of this request reading it from socket, parsing, querying for data, sending the response is handled by the worker thread. Is this a correct approachp  pWhat bothers mep  pLets say there are 4 worker threads and 4 events from the same user in the queue. Workers pick the requests up and simultaneously read and write to the same socket. Is this resulting in dirty readswrites e.g one thread gets a part of a client request, and the other thread the rest and thus generating no response to invalid requests. Should I use mutexes on those descriptors until I read a full request Another idea is to read the request in the main thread and put the request itself into event queue. Then workers would then only need to write to the socket do I still need a mutex here.p

Negative 868 pWhen presenting a codeUIViewControllercode using a button on Xcode through code, you usually usep  pcode[self presentViewControllerviewControllerInstance animatedYES completionnil]codep  pNormally, before presenting the codeviewControllerInstancecode, I can make changes to that instance like setting some of its properties. However, this time I am using storyboard, and I was wondering how I would access the instance of the view controller being presented if its not being created in code Id like to be able to set some properties of that specific codeUIViewControllercodep  pThank you in advancedp

Negative 868 pI made a Job to read data from 3 different tables in order to fetch information and fill a fourth one.

I cant make a for cycle with lenght of table enter rows because during one cycle more than one row might be deleted. The only reliable thing to track is table enter emptiness.

Negative 868 pIm having memory issues because it looks like Django is loading the objects into memory when using codedeletecode. Is there any way to prevent Django from doing thatp  pFrom the Django docsp  blockquote   pDjango needs to fetch objects into memory to send signals and handle cascades. However, if there are no cascades and no signals, then Django may take a fastpath and delete objects without fetching into memory. For large deletes this can result in significantly reduced memory usage. The amount of executed queries can be reduced, too.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.8refmodelsquerysetsdelete relnofollowhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.8refmodelsquerysetsdeleteap  pI dont use signals. I do have foreign keys on the model Im trying to delete, but I dont see why Django would need to load the objects into memory. It looks like it does, because my memory is rising as the query runs.p

Negative 868 pAlthough I can see similar question asked in this forum e.g. a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions12289973tryingtounderstandfinalabstractclassintprivateextendsanyvalinscalafinal abstract classa however I dont see the clear explanation as how one can use both final and abstract at the same time. I come from Java background and it is imprinted in my mind that abstract and final can never be used simultaneously but this scala declaration is defying my java concept.p  pIn Scala API we have values classes e.g. Int, Double, Float etc. which are declared as strongemabstract final class Int extends AnyValemstrong. My confusion is how one can enforce abstract methods to be implemented in subclass by using abstract keyword and at the same time restricting inheriting of class by using final.p  pI understood that one cant write its custom value class e.g. strongclass MyInt extends Intstrong  in scala because Int is final but then how the list of abstract methods available in Int class e.g. those declared with abstract def  etc. would have implemented in API itself Is it something to do with implicit conversionp  pAppreciate your guidance in correcting my concepts.p

Negative 868 pFor a project that I am doing I am trying to essentially convert an mp3 file into vibrations. I have talked to staff at SparkFun Electronics who set me up with the Lilypad Vibe Board and the Arduino Uno. It is in my understanding that with the Arduino Uno its unable to read an MP3 file and convert it into PWM so that the Lilypad Vibe Board can produce the vibrations. Does anyone know if there is any code or another device that will allow me to do this I have researched the Raspberry Pi but am also unsure as to if this will work in the way i would like it to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated. My aim is to take an mp3 file, convert it into PWM so that the Lilypad Vibe Board would be able to create the vibrations in relation to the mp3 file. p
