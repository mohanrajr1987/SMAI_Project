Positive 7158 pI have a program that currently implemented using Qt framework with signal amp slot mechanism. However due to some requirements, I need to split the program in two parts 1The library, which is plain c, independent from thirdparty softwares and 2The GUI application, which linked to the library 1 and can have dependencies to Qt.p  pThat means I need to refactor some classes from the original signalslot approach and implement c observer pattern  listener instead.p  pSo my question is, how can my GUI Qt part communicate with the rewritten library, is there a way to connect a signalslot with its equivalent C callbacks.p  pFor example if I have the following class Example.hp  precodesignal  void datasent bool starttimer  true  codepre  pNow its gonna be moved to ExampleListener.hp  precodevoid ondatasent bool starttimer  true  codepre  pAnd in the GUI part I had p  precodeconnect mstate, SIGNAL datasent , this, SLOT update    codepre  pIs it valid to have something like thisp  precodeconnect mstate, SIGNAL ondatasent  , this, SLOT update    codepre  pSo in short, is a mix between signal  slot and traditional C callbacks works p  pThanks a lotp

Positive 7158 pLets say I have a class Child that inherits from class Parent. Both classes need to be able to be able to send a function pointer of the same method, lets call it foo, to an API. p  pI dont think I can make foo a member function, since the process invoking the callback would need to have an object of either Child or Parent to call it with. I also dont think I can make foo a static member function since there may be multiple instances of Parent of Child. p  pWhat would be the cleanest place to put foo in this case Should it go into its own file and have its own namespace, and get included into both Parent and Child Should foo be in Parent only meaning Child would need to include Parent.cpp and forward declare foo p  pAppreciate any insightp

Positive 7158 pI am running a piece of python code on a raspberry pi.br The function of the code is that GPIO 5 is set as a pull up resistor with a momentary switch attached. When the switch is pressed it grounds the pull up resistor. I am attempting to use the button push to trigger a callback.br The callback works like thisbr If the button is pressed and detected as still pressed it defines a variable called t1 as the current time.br If the button is detected as no longer pressed it defines a variable called t2 then subtracts t1 from t2 to find the time difference amount of time button was held down for. It then converts that value to an integer defined as variable deltaseconds.  Then it takes action based on the length the button was held for. If more than 7 seconds, reboot the raspberry pi, if more than 1 second but less than 7 it toggles output GPIO12 between high and low.  p  pThe issue I am experiencing is like thisbr The code runsbr When the button is pressed I see the print of Button 5 pressedbr When the button is released I see the print Button 5 releasedbr Then an error is display as codeUnboundLocalError local variable t1 referenced before assignmentcodebr The error is in reference to line 21 codedelta  t2t1code  p  pThe full code looks like this  p  precodeimport os import RPi.GPIO as GPIO import webiopi import time import datetime from datetime import datetime GPIO.setwarningsTrue GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BCM BUTTON5  5 GPIO.setup5, GPIO.IN, pullupdownGPIO.PUDUP GPIO.setup12,GPIO.OUT GPIO.output12,1 Just to visually distinguish between setup steps and main program def pressedBUTTON5     if GPIO.input5  False         t1  datetime.now         print Button 5 pressed     elif GPIO.input5  True         print Button 5 released         t2  datetime.now         delta  t2t1         deltaseconds  delta.totalseconds         if deltaseconds gt 7   pressed for gt 7 seconds             print Restarting System             subprocess.call[shutdown r now System halted by GPIO action amp], shellTrue         elif deltaseconds gt 1   press for gt 1 lt 7 seconds             print Toggling GPIO 12             GPIO.output12, not GPIO.input12 GPIO.addeventdetectBUTTON5, GPIO.BOTH, bouncetime200 GPIO.addeventcallbackBUTTON5, pressed try     while True         time.sleep1 except KeyboardInterrupt     GPIO.cleanup        clean up GPIO on CTRLC exit codepre

Negative 7158 pI have some Label controls sitting on Panel controls on a Form. I want to get the labels positions relative to the forms origin so that at run time I can hide the panel and the labels and draw some other text in their place directly onto the form.p  pBasically, Im doing the following calculation Get the absolute screen position of a label with Control.PointToScreen and convert it back to a relative position with Control.PointToClient, so eitherp  precodeDim newloc As Point  Me.PointToClientctl.PointToScreenPoint.Empty codepre  porp  precodeDim newloc As Point  Me.PointToClientctl.Parent.PointToScreenctl.Location codepre  pI have found that the two methods sometimes give me different results  putting my new point out of the visible area with negative values  but havent been able to determine why. I would have thought they should be identical and they are, most of the time.p  pReading the docs didnt help the first time around, but perhaps I skipped over something... Anyway, Id be thankful for any help before I start tearing my hair out.p  pOr, on the other hand, is there a better way to do thisp  pstrongEdit Sample resultsstrongp  pSo, heres a real example.p  pLabel1 at X4,Y6 on Panel1 Label2 at X163,Y6 on the same parent, Panel1. Obviously Im expecting different Xpositions, but Y should be identical for both.p  pWhen I run the project both prectl.PointToScreenPoint.Emptypre and prectl.Parent.PointToScreenctl.Locationpre give me the same screen location for Label1 at X959,Y119 the absolute values here can vary, of course, depending on the position of the form itself and therefore the correct location relative to the form when Me.PointToClient is applied at X5,Y32.p  pThe very next lines do the same calculations for Label2 remember, same Parent, same Yvalue within the parent 6, but the results are totally off ctl.Parent.PointToScreen gives me  X1114,Y63. X is almost correct 95941631118, but Y is nowhere near the 119 I got for Label1. And then ctl.PointToScreen gives me X166,Y29  translated back to FormCoordinates Me.PointToClient X784,Y2. p  pThese numbers are calculated and printed to the debug window directly after each other, without moving anything around... Madness.p  pOK, this is getting rather messy, but I still hope someone has a simple explanation. Thanksp

Negative 7158 pIm asking this question because I havent seen it documented anywhere. We are using a combination of Team Foundation Server 2008 and Team Explorer 2005.p  pIs it possible to deploy a custom checkin policy that works in such an environment p  pObviously, the custom checkin policy contains some code that must run on the clientside in order to display help, etc.. So it should use the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Client assembly that comes with Team Explorer 2005.p  pBut, my sense tells me that, in order to be effective, a checkin policy should be enforced on the server itself for example, to support checkingin changes from the commandline or using the raw Web Services API. So, there, it would have to run against the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Client that comes with Team Foundation Server 2008.p  pSo, is it possible to build a single custom checkin policy that takes the most recent version the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Client assembly 2005 on the client and 2008 on the serverp  pOr do I have to build two custom checkin policies, one for the client and one for the server  Would that even work p  pOr do custom checkin policies only ever exist on the client side p

Negative 7158 pI am trying to create a search for my website over a mySQL database.

Negative 7158 pI have a 2dimensional array in Ruby that I want to produce a working duplicate of. Obviously I cant do thisp  precodearray[[3,4],[5,9],[10,2],[11,3]] temparrayarray codepre  pas any modifications I make to temparray will also be made to array, as I have merely copied the object identifier. I thought I would be able to get around this by simply usingp  precodetemparrayarray.dup codepre  pbut this doesnt work as temparray is simply an array of object identifiers that get duplicated so I still end up modifying the initial array if I understand what went wrong when I did this. The solution I found was to do the followingp  precodetemparray[] array.eachsub temparray ltlt sub.dup codepre  pThis achieves what I want but seems to be an awkward way of solving my problem.p  pI am concerned about how this would work if I didnt know what my array was going to be containing e.g. if it was possible that some parts of the array had 3dimensions. I would potentially have to test the class of each member of the array to see if it had to be iterated over in order to duplicate it. Not an impossible task at all, but it seems messy to me. Is this simply a consequence of Ruby lacking builtin support for multidimensional arrays or is there a simple builtin function to do this that I have missed p

This code uses java.util.logging.  p  pI debug my plugin by starting up a new workbench using a JVM option codeDjava.util.logging.config.filecompletelySpecifiedPathlogging.propertiescode.

Unfortunately, the custom formatter that I specified via codejava.util.logging.FileHandler.formattercode does not seem to get called the output in the file is in what looks to be a default XML format.  The logging works okay in the legacy code, i.e., my custom formatter gets used.p  pOne thing I am wondering about is how the plugin handles the logging dependencies.  Is it possible that I need to explicitly enter some logging dependencies in MANIFEST.MF  I dont see how Eclipse could calculate the dependency for me, because the dependency isnt in code, rather its in the logging.properties file.  Furthermore, is it possible or desirable to say that java.util.logging depends on my classp  pAny help andor ideas would be much appreciated.p  pCheers, Keithp

Negative 7158 pI have often the case where I want to return an codeEnumerableltTgtcode from a method or a property. To build the returning codeEnumerableltTgtcode, I use a codeListltTgtcodeinstance. After filling the list, I return the list.p  pI always thought that this is enough. But it exists the possibility that the caller casts the resulting codeEnumerableltTgtcode back into the codeListltTgtcode and begins to work further with it. If in a later time I change the implementation of my method, the callers code will fail. To avoid this, I could return list.ToArray or make a readonly list before returning it to the caller. But for me this seems to be a big overkill. What do you thinkp  pPlease note, strongI never will return an internally used liststrong so that the caller can change my objects internal state. The question is only about a short living list that is built temporary to hold the return values.p  precodeIEnumerableltstringgt GetAList      Listltstringgt aList  new Listltstringgt     aList.Adda     aList.Addb     return aList   IEnumerableltstringgt GetAList      Listltstringgt aList  new Listltstringgt     aList.Adda     aList.Addb     return aList.ToArrayltstringgt  codepre  pThe examples are supersimple and in this case I would work from the beginning on with arrays, but its only to show explain the question.p

Negative 7158 pI have a pretty basic understanding of the GUI thread and the message loop, but Im curious as to how that applies to one window starting a modal window.

Im not even sure if GUI thread is the right name for that thread, but people usually can guess what Im talking about.p  pSo in short, how do threads and modal windows get along togetherp

Negative 7158 pI have a problem when inserting into mysql.p  pI have a multidimensional array in javascript that gets converted into a string in JSON format. The string looks like this for examplep  pcode[[text1,text2,text with apostrophe],[subarray2,a u000a unicode number,change line n n]]codep  pSo the thing is that this format uses double quotes outside the fields, and then inside sometimes I have single quotes, and escape characters codecode as you can see.p  pIf I send this from javascript to php through ajax and decode it in php, it all works great, no problems, perfect.p  pThe problem comes when I need to insert it into mysql.p  ol limagicquotes is off everywhere in php.inili liI do use mysqlrealescapestring function before I insert in mysqlli ol  pBut whatever I do, the insert is successful, but in the database the double quotes get converted to single quotes, and also the codecode escape characters disappear.p  pSo inside database I am left with thisp  pcode[[text1,text2,text with apostrophe],[subarray2,a u000a unicode number,change line n n]]codep  pThis is a problem of course as I need to preserve the double quotes so that when I read this from php later, I can decode the JSON and still keep the single quotes inside the text.  Also the codencode new line and the codeu000acode unicode characters dont work anymore because the escape characters have disappeared.p  pI found the trick to use codehtmlspecialcharsthephrase, ENTQUOTEScode which converts double quotes to codeampquotcode. This at least preserves my double quotes and single quotes separated, but this is obviously not the ideal solution, plus I still lose the escape codecode characters.p  pSomething is obviously wrong in what Im doing or the configuration, the problem is not related to the JSON, if I simply insert directly in mysql double and single quotes together, the double ones get converted to single.p  pSo anyway the question I guess is, in a text where I have double quotes, single quotes, escape characters and new line characters, how can I make sure that, when I insert all that in mysql, I preserve all of those in the mysql varchar or text field double quotes, single quotes, codecode escape characters and new line charactersp  pI have made sure that magicquotes is off everywhere in php.inip  pThank you very much for any advice or help.p

If using Javascript, should I use canvas or SVG  The app will allow drag selection to select multiple items.p  pIm trying to make up my mind with performance and browser support placed as top priority.  Do you guys have any suggestions and resources that you could point me to if Javascript is the better optionp

Negative 7158 pIm looking for a way to copy stored procedures from one sql database to another on the same instance. It needs to be automatic, preferably through code tsql or anything, so using the generate scripts trick is not viable plus I dont want to maintain that many scripts, and people forget to run them.p  pIve searched a bit on this and have not found a workable solution. Someone suggested a clever trick with generating all the stored procedure text into a sql field and then converting that and executing it on the destination db but unfortunately that had issues.p  pHas anyone got any other ideas on how this can be done, if its at all possiblep  pIf I cant do it programmatically, would there be a quick solution using ssisp  pThanks.p  pEdit Using mixture of sql 2005 and 2008 versions.p
Negative 7158 pIm building an application that will have many forms and there will sometimes be wait times for several situations.

Negative 7158 pI have a WCF service written and working on my development machine. Its a simple service that takes its parameters and puts them into an Oracle Database.

Negative 7158 pi decided to write my own JAAS login module. So far everything works fine, yet there is something i cant google out. Assume the login function by emLoginContextem has successfuly authenticated a user. How do I attach user roles to the authenticated subject so that it works with security constraints in web.xml file Also how do I make it work with security annotations for my session beans The way of aquiring the user roles is clear of course, the question is where do i put this data so it throws an exception on privileged functions if not authorized. I am using glassfish 3 and the point of my attempt is to create something like databaseloginmodule from jboss. Thank you for reading this, any hints, keywords are welcomed. stup

Negative 7158 pI have an model which has a many to many relationship with itself.p  pI want to create a validation on the models which would prevent a group from being its own subgroup, or a subgroup of its subgroups, etc. The objective is to prevent a situation which can result in a loop  infinite recursion. p  pIve tried implementing this in the model clean method as shown below.p  pIve also tried implementing this in the model save method using transactions.  p  pIn both situations, Ive ended up in a situation where invalid changes are incorrectly saved to the database, but if I attempt to make further changes to either instance, the validations detect the error, but at that point, the bad data is already in the database.p  pIm wondering if this is possible, and if so, if its possible to do so in model validations so I dont have to make sure everyone on my team remembers to call these validations from all forms they create in the future.p  pWithout further delay, the codep  precodeclass Groupmodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength200     subgroups  models.ManyToManyFieldself, throughSubGroup, symmetricalFalse      def validatenogrouploopsself, seenNone         if seen is None             seen  []         if self.id in seen             raise ValidationErrorLOOP DETECTED         seen.appendself.id         for subgroup in self.target.all             subgroup.target.validatenogrouploopsseen       I thought I would use the standard validation mechanism in the clean      method, but it appears that when I recurse back to the group I started       with, I do so with a query to the database which retreives the data before      its been modified. Im still not 100 sure if this is the case, but      regardless, it does not work.     def cleanself         self.validatenogrouploops       Suspecting that the problem with implementing this in clean was that       I wasnt testing the data with the pending modifications due to the       repeated queries to the database, I thought that I could handle the      validation in save, let the save actually put the bad data into the      database, and then roll back the transaction if I detect a problem.      This also doesnt work.     def saveself, args, kwargs         superGroup, self.saveargs, kwargs         try             self.validatenogrouploops         except ValidationError as e             transaction.rollback             raise e         else             transaction.commit   class SubGroupmodels.Model     VERBS    ,        action  models.CharFieldmaxlength1, choicesVERBS.items, default     source  models.ForeignKeyGroup, relatednametarget     target  models.ForeignKeyGroup, relatednamesource codepre  pThanks ahead of time for any assistance you may provide.p  p[edit] FYI, If you couldnt tell based on the mechanism Im using to manage transactions, Im currently using django 1.2 because thats whats available in the fedora EPEL repository for RHEL6.

Negative 7158 pI am looking for a way to approximate a volume of fluid moving over a heightmap. The easiest solution I can think of is to approximate it as a large number of nondrawn spheres, of small diameter lt0.1m. I would then place a visible plane representing the surface of the water on top of the spheres, at the locations they came to rest. To my knowledge, no managed physics engines contain a built in fluid simulator, hence the question.p  pImplementation would consist of using a physics engine such as JigLibX, which is capable of simulating the motion of the spheres. To determine the height of the planes, I was thinking of averaging the maximum height of each sphere that is on the top layer of a grouping. p  pI dont expect performance to be great, but would it be approachable for real time If not, could I use this simulation to prebake lines of flow p  pI hope this makes sense, I really want opinionssuggestions as to whether this is feasible, or if there is a better way of approaching this.p  pThanks for any help, Venatu  p  pIf its relevant, my target platform is XNA 4.0, using C. Windows only at this point in time, so PhysXHavok are possibilities for the simulation, but I would prefer a managed solutionp

Negative 7158 pIve uploaded a VS2010 project at the below location. This test app should be run once you have a full screen application running. As soon as its running, you have 2 seconds to click back on your fullscreen application. It creates 2 modeless dialog boxes using the full screen application which should be the last window to have focus as the owner of the dialog boxes. One dialog is displayed, hidden, the second dialog is displayed, hidden and then the first dialog is displayed again in a cycle. What I find is that when the first dialog box is displayed for the second time, the taskbar pops up. Ive spent 4 painful days trying to understand whats going on here and I am desperate for some help.p  pI received some help which suggested that when I call DestroyWindow to hide the dialogs, Windows would put focus somewhere  and in my case the taskbar. Previously when I asked this question I wasnt using the full screen application as the Owner of my windows. I would have thought that the focus should go back to the owner window I have also tried calling SetFocus and SetForegroundWindow on the full screen application prior to calling DestroyWindow on my dialog  but the seems to cause the taskbar to appear everytime and I dont want that at all.p  pPlease helpp  pa hrefhttpwww.mediafire.comiky0wqb816i7bir relnofollowSample VS2010 Projectap

Negative 7158 h3Situationh3  pSimilar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5718204interactivepythonnetworkgraphmodelingthis questiona, Im looking for a way to create a GUI where users are able to see a graph in the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGraphtheory relnofollowgraph theorya sense and interact with it. Vehicles will move across the graph from none to node over time. Users should be able to add nodes and edges and add Vehicles and set their destination.p  pI have already implemented the underlying graph model and business logic, I just need a GUI for it. This means that I do not need graph algorithm functionality such as Djistras algorithm.p  pIf possible, the solution should be platform independent. The underlying model is written in python, so the GUI solution either needs to be python based which would be preferable, or should easily interface with python potentially IPC.p  pPerformance is a concern. It doesnt need to be blindingly fast, but it must be fast enough to keep up with the underlying model. Notionally, there is no limit on the number of nodes, edges and vehicles which may be present in the graph.p  h3Possible approachesh3  pI have looked at various visualisation librariesp  ul lia hrefhttpnodebox.netcodeindex.phpGraph relnofollowNodeBoxali lia hrefhttpnetworkx.lanl.gov relnofollowNetworkXali lia hrefhttpmatplotlib.sourceforge.net relnofollowmatplotlibali lia hrefhttpwww.graphviz.org relnofollowGraphVizali ul  pI have contemplated using a hrefhttpwww.opengl.org relnofollowOpenGLa.p  pI have thought about drawing straight to a hrefhttpwww.wxpython.org relnofollowwxPythona.p  h3Problemsh3  pI havent used any of the graph libraries.

I cant find an example of someone implementing a graph with it aside from through NetworkX. For another example, can NetworkX plot objects travelling along edgesp  pAn OpenGL solution would almost certainly take more time to implement. I would have to code functions for moving objects across edges myself. I would have to code a function for drawing the edges in the right place, and drawing labels for all of the edges and nodes and vehicles etc. I would need to implement menus and handle interactions from scratch.p  pIm not sure how I would go about implementing this in wxPython. I only know how to use it in conjunction with standard widgets. strongUpdatestrong I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4447658wxpythonnetworkgraphclickablewithcontextmenuanypkgsthis questiona which has an answer which points to a hrefhttpwww.wxpython.orgdocsapiwx.lib.oglmodule.html relnofollowwx.lib.ogla or a hrefhttpwww.wxpython.orgdocsapiwx.lib.floatcanvasmodule.html relnofollowwx.lib.floatcanvasa as a mechanism for implementing a solution in pure wxPython.p  h3Questionsh3  pDo any of the visualisation libraries meet my requirements Of those that do, which are most suited Are there other libraries I have missed which would meet my requirements Something like a hrefhttpswww.jgraph.comjgraph.html relnofollowJGrapha but for Python instead of Java would be suitable.p  pWhat is your opinion on implementing this in OpenGL or wxPython as opposed to one of these librariesp  pAre there other approaches I havent considered that you think would be appropriatep

Negative 7158 pHello I am trying to generate a Drupal node which would be similar to a feed page generated by views module. I need to generate an xml feed, so I would not want to show the regular drupal template that is showed up on every node. I am trying to understand how the views for feed works as I want to display my page in a similar fashion, without the drupal template. Any suggestions would be great.p

Now, I want to do the same with my MVC3 project.p  pEvery user has the same rights inside the database. The nonwebprogram handles the rights itself. After logging in successful with an SQL account, the login name is mapped to an entity in the database from which one can get the users ID and handle the right management.

Negative 7158 pI am starting my first project using DDD using C and at this stage I feel we will probably go with MongoDB or maybe CouchDB for the persistence an ORM like Entity framework seems too much of an overkill for what we want, but saying that I have pretty much zero experience in MongoDB or CouchDB at this stage.p  pAs I am creating my domain I thought about using GUIDS as my IDs for my entities coming from a relational database world, still having trouble moving away from it. p  pIf I go down this route will I be able to easily plugin in my persistence layer mongoDBCouchDB or would I have to change my domain model currently my constructors on my entity objects have a string ID as a parameter which will be the GUID ID.p  pJD p
Negative 7158 pI am containing the primary object with most of the features within a helper object that will provide convenience methods.  I have only an Interface available, aside from a returned object with that interface from a factory method.  I am thinking a good way to extend this object is composition, but the problem that my superclass must implement the primary objects interface, which would be about 600 lines of stub code.p  pClearly an uncomplicated but verbose solution would be to fill out all the stubs so they merely call the primary objects methods.  Is there a better way than this in Java  In other languages Im familiar with, there would be ways to do automatic delegation for methods that are not implemented in the helper object.p  pExamplep  pre class Helper implements Interface      Primary primary      HelperPrimary primary          primary  primary           void helper          doStuff            500 lines of this     void stub          primary.stub       pre  pNotep  pOriginal plan was to just use regular expressions to replace all the stub TODOs in Eclipse with the actual calls.  Will be looking for an Eclipse tool that does this automatically though.  Also, looks like extending the interface or using Proxy is better in the end, so will be pursuing that.p

Negative 7158 pIve been working on my first XCodeiOS project and so far its been an enjoyable experience.  Currently, I am working on a Nib file that acts as a primary display for other views.  Within this Nib file, I have a primary UIView and next to it I am designing a series of seven other views.  At runtime I swap these seven views in and out when necessary, within a container UIVie, located on my primary UIView.p  pAcross my 8 total views that Im designing in IB, I have a large amount of buttons, images and other objects that need to be linked to IBOutlets.  As this project is getting bigger, it would helpful if I could split my class across multiple code files.p  pUsing categories is the solution, however, Ive hit an annoyance when I tried to create an IBOutlet in one of my category headers, the XCode compiler keeps giving me errors and warnings about ivars and outlets.  In my Nib I have a large number of objects that need outlets and Id prefer to not have to define all of them in one, huge code file if thats possible.  p  pHowever, I understand that I have to work within my limitations, so my question is a bit different than asking how to add an IBOutlet to a category.  Instead, Id like to know what are the best practices for splitting up a large UIViewController class across multiple code files  What are the limitations of objectivec and what is the best way to structure your code when working with interface designp  pMy code is not quite yet unwieldy, but Id really like to start restructuring it so that it will be much more manageable when it consists of 100s of methods and 1,000s of lines of code.p  pAny pointers would be helpful.

Negative 7158 pthis has gotten to the point of absolute frustration.  we are trying to write some js that will insert text at a specific location in the text associated with a textarea.  it seems like it should be simple but so far we havent figured it out.p  pwhat complicates our process is that we have a floating menu from which you make selections about what you want to insert.  so the sequence isp  ul lipposition to the desired insert location in the textarea.  using a debugger breakpoint, visual studio debugger indicates that the textarea object has selectionStart and selectionEnd defined as numbers with the correct values.  if at that break, you try and write js that accesses selectionStart and selectionEnd you get undefined which doesnt make sense but there are a lot of postings here that say everyone else has the same issuepli lipnow we position to the floating menu which is nothing more than a div wrapper on a table where the td elements call a function to insert text.  if we click exactly on the td element, the text will get inserted where it belongs.  if at anytime we click outside the td element but inside the menu, document selection gets reset to the beginning of the text area and we insert at the wrong location.pli lipwe have tried trapping the onclick event chain associated with the menu and there is nothing obvious going on that would cause document selection to change but it does none the less.pli lipwe have tried a variety of workarounds where we put an onClick on the textarea itself and remember the current range for the textarea but that always ends up at the front of the buffer.pli ul  pso in simple terms  why doesnt createTextRange and document selection behave in a rational manner on ie and what is the workaroundp  pwhat does jquery do that worksaround this issue since the most common answer to the postings about this seems to be use jquery.p

Negative 7158 pIm playing looped sound with AVAudioPlayer by setting the numberOfLoops property to 1. And I want to control the loop rate programmatically, so Im loading my audio data like thisp  precodeNSString soundFilePath  [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourceClick ofTypeaif] NSMutableData soundData  [NSMutableData dataWithContentsOfFilesoundFilePath] codepre  pAnd then changing its length before initializing the audio playerp  precodeint loopDuration  .5  seconds int desiredDataLength  loopDuration  2  44100  this assumes 16bit mono data [soundData setLengthdesiredDataLength] NSLogdata , soundData  this shows the data after our length change AVAudioPlayer soundPlayer  [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithDatasoundData errorNULL] soundPlayer.numberOfLoops  1 [soundPlayer play] codepre  pThis works perfectly if I set a loopDuration thats smaller than the duration of the original file  the extra data is truncated and the loop plays at the desired speed. But if I set a loopDuration thats longer than the original file, the loop plays too quickly  each iteration only lasts as long as the duration of the original file.p  pI can confirm from the NSLog line that soundData is getting padded to the correct length. I thought maybe AVAudioPlayer was ignoring the trailing 0s in the data and restarting the loop when it saw all those 0s, so instead of simply setting the data length, I tried padding it with some valuesp  precodeNSData filler  [1234 dataUsingEncodingNSASCIIStringEncoding] while desiredDataLength gt [soundData length]      [soundData appendDatafiller]  codepre  pBut the loop still restarts at the point where the original file data stops. As a sanity check, I tried doubling the sound data...p  precode    [soundData appendDatasoundData] codepre  p...and then setting numberOfLoops to 4 and playing the data. I expected to hear the sound 8 times, but I only heard it play 4 times But if I log soundData, I can see that its length has been doubled.p  pIt seems like theres some kind of intelligence built into the looping mechanism that makes the loop restart when it thinks it should, instead of when it gets to the end of the data. Does anyone have insight into whats really happening, and how I can work around it to get my desired resultp  pUPDATE I found that if I open my original sound files in an audio editor and add silence to the ends, to make them long enough for my slowest loop speed, AVAudioPlayer handles them as I want it to. But when I view the NSLog output, I see that this data also ends in all 0s. Why does AVAudioPlayer respect the silence I added in an audio editor, but not the silence I added by padding the data programmaticallyp
Negative 7158 pI have a simple datepicker Im using on a couple of date inputs.  Heres the code p  precodeinput.isDate.datepicker     numberOfMonths 1,     onSelect function           this.removeClassplaceholder default is to keep placeholder style format     ,                                           onClose function           this.focus otherwise focus goes to neverneverland       codepre  pDatepicker shows on focus.  The two .isDate inputs have a placeholder value of Date. p  pThe problem arises if the user presses the escape key when in the datepicker.  The intended behavior of this is to close the datepicker and restore whatever text was in the box at point of entry. In my case the input boxs value becomes the placeholder value.  Leaving the box at this point leaves the word Date in the box as a hard value rather than as a placeholder prompt, so it trips some fieldlevel date validation that I have.  p  pIve been able to deal with that by blanking the text value when the user leaves the box, but the user oughtnt to have to erase that text when he escapes out of the datepicker to enter a date manually.  Ive made numerous attempts to use events to get rid of this, and none of them work Ive tried focusin, trapping esc in keypress, and the create, beforeDisplay, onSelect and onClose events of the datepicker itself.  In all these cases, the value of the box was still .  Clearly, the datepicker sets the value of the box after finishing all of its business, and Im thinking that placeholder wasnt taken into account in this design.  Possibly a bug  Were using the Whitelabel skin, so maybe they are interfering with the datepicker in some way  Anyway, Id much appreciate a workaround or an explanation.  I havent been able to find much of either.p  pTIAp

Negative 7158 pI have a content type Audio which includes an audio file field. This field accepts multiple values, so each node could contain any number of audio files. Ordinarily, when you build an RSS feed view, it will generate one codeltitemgtcode per node, and each of those will have multiple codeltenclosuregtcode entries, one per audio file. But for my purposes I need the view to output a separate codeltitemgtcode for each of the audio file values. So if, for example, there are 3 audio files in a selected node, the whole node will be repeated in the feed 3 times, and each one will contain only one audio file enclosure.p  pThe reason for this is that in my specific case, Im using codehooknodeviewcode in a custom module to add MRSS tags to each of the nodes that the view generates. So rather than the audio files being wrapped by codeltenclosuregtcode theyll be wrapped in codeltmediacontentgtcode tags. According to the MRSS specification, you shouldnt have more than one codeltmediacontentgtcode entry per codeltitemgtcode unless they represent the same content. This is because the other tags like codelttitlegtcode and codeltdescriptiongtcode pertain to all of the codeltmediacontentgtcode tags in the same codeltitemgtcode. Ironically enough, the customization hook is the easiest part, but first I need to get the view to output the nodes in the manner Ive described.p  pSo is there some way I can use the new Drupal 7 views grouping feature or some other method to generate the output Im looking for Id love to know the trick Otherwise Ill have to use a custom menu entry and lose all the advantages such as automatic caching and being able to work within the Views UI that I get with Views.p

Negative 7158 pI have a GridView where Im setting the ItemsSource in codebehind.  All columns in the grid are defined in XAML, and all column widths are Auto.  When I initially set ItemsSource of the grid, the column widths are set correctly. p  pNow, depending on the users actions, the ItemsSource of the grid may be set to a new EntityCollection.  What I have noticed is that the column widths remain as they were with the previous ItemsSource.  That is, the column widths dont seem to adjust themselves automatically when a new ItemsSource is set for the Grid.  Is there any way in codebehind or XAML to force the Grid to use the new ItemsSource when setting the column widths  I would think that this would be something that the GridView would do automatically when its ItemsSource is reset.p  precodeltScrollViewer VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAutogt     ltListViewgt         ltListView.Viewgt             ltGridViewgt                 ltGridView.Columnsgt                     ltGridViewColumn WidthAuto HeaderStatusgt                         ltGridViewColumn.CellTemplategt                             ltDataTemplategt                                 ltImage Width16 Height16 SourceBinding PathBlocking gt                             ltDataTemplategt                         ltGridViewColumn.CellTemplategt                     ltGridViewColumngt                     ltGridViewColumn WidthAuto HeaderTitlegt                         ltGridViewColumn.CellTemplategt                             ltDataTemplategt                                 ltTextBlock TextTrimmingCharacterEllipsis TextBinding gt                             ltDataTemplategt                         ltGridViewColumn.CellTemplategt                     ltGridViewColumngt                 ltGridView.Columnsgt             ltGridViewgt         ltListView.Viewgt     ltListViewgt ltScrollViewergt codepre

Negative 7158 pWe had a terrible problemexperience yesterday when trying to swap our staging lt production role.p  pstrongHere is our setupstrong p  pWe have a workerrole picking up messages from the queue. These messages are processed on the role. Table Storage inserts, db selects etc . This can take maybe 13 seconds per queue message depending on how many table storage posts he needs to make. He will delete the message when everything is finished.p  pstrongProblem when swappingstrongp  pWhen our staging project went online our production workerrole started erroring. p  pWhen the role wanted to process queue messsage it gave a constant stream of strongEntityAlreadyExistsstrong errors. Because of these errors queue messages werent getting deleted. This caused the queue messages to be put back in the queue and back to processing and so on.... p  pWhen looking inside these queue messages and analysing what would happend with them we saw they were actually processed but not deleted. p  pThe problem wasnt over when deleting these faulty messages. Newly queue messages werent processed as well while these werent processed yet and no table storage records were added, which sounds very strange.p  pWhen deleting both staging and producting and publishing to production again everything started to work just fine.p  pstrongPossible problemsstrongp  pWe have litle 2 no idea what happened actually.p  ul liMaybe both the roles picked up the same messages and one did the post and one erroredli li...li ul  pstrongPossible solutionsstrongp  pWe have some ideas on how to solve this problem.p  ul liMake a poison message fail over system When the dequeue count gets over X we should just delete that queue message or place it into a separate poisonqueue.li liCatch the EntityAlreadyExists error and just delete that queue message or put it in a separate queue.li li...li ul  pstrongMultiple rolesstrongp  pI suppose we will have the same problem when putting up multiple roles p  pMany thanks.p  pstrongEDIT 24022012  Extra informationstrongp  ul liWe actually use the strongGetMessagestrongli liEvery item in the queue is unique and will generate unique messages in table Storage. Little more information about the process A user posts something and will have to be distributed to certain other users. The message generate from that user will have a unique Id guid. This message will be posted into the queue and picked up by the worker role. The message is distributed over several other tables partitionkey  UserId, rowkey  Some timestamp in ticks amp the unique message id. So there is almost no chance the same messages will be posted in a normal situation.li liThe invisibility time out strongCOULD be a logical explanationstrong because some messages could be distributed to like 1020 tables. This means 1020 insert without the batch option. Can you set or expand this stronginvisibility timestrong outli liNot deleting the queue message because of an exception strongCOULDstrong be a explanation as well because we didnt implement any poison message fail over YET . li ul

Negative 7158 pI am developing a web application in which a user can Create a table in data base. I am thinking on taking the attribute names and table description from user and put them into SQL query and execute it.

Or is this the approach in software industryp  pAnother approach I can think of is taking all the information about creating a new table from user and inserting them into one table and have some kind of trigger on this table which creates a new table everytime when insertion is performed into the first table.What would be the SQL Script for such thing if my approach is correctp  pI am using SPRING  MVC, Hibernate, MySQL, REST web servicep  pPlease correct me if I am thinking in wrong direction.

Negative 7158 pstrongIn summarystrong The category of all items added needs to be saved along with the name of an item. This then allows for this category info to be transmitted on submit so that the correct query is used relating to the correct table. Ideasp  pWhat I need to do is that when a user selects what theyre searching for from the autocomplete drop down, the category information aka the name of its category, is also recorded somewhere.p  pThe idea is that when the user presses search, the phrase theyre looking for as well as the category name is also sent. Reasoning Youve got 3 tables, one containing information on cars, one on animals and one on aliens. You wouldnt need to query all 3 if the table it relates to is already determined from the category information.p  pThe issue with searching all 3 is that you might have an alien named Sponge Bob, as well as an animal etc.p  pHeres the code were dealing with from the jQueryUI websitep  precode.widget custom.catcomplete, .ui.autocomplete,      renderMenu function ul, items           var self  this,             currentCategory           .each items, function index, item               if  item.category  currentCategory                   ul.append ltli classuiautocompletecategorygt  item.category  ltligt                  currentCategory  item.category                          self.renderItem ul, item                 codepre  pMy thinking is that within the category complete function, under the select eventp  precodefunction           search .catcomplete             delay0,             source queryencodejson.phpterm search.val,             select functionevent, ui                                  codepre  pthe category that is associated with the selected item, can be sentstored somewhere. The issue Im having is that I can get this information in the widget function item.category but this information is not available directly in the select event. This makes sense as the widget only populates the list, it doesnt deal with the select event Im thinking, but somehow I need to be able to access this information. My thoughts have been to find the index and work backwards from there but that doesnt seem to work. The other option more basic is that each time the widget is looped through, the category name is added to the title field of the li element.p  pIve been trying for hours and not getting anywhere with either solution.p  pThanks for any light you may be able to shed p

Negative 7158 pemThis is both a question and kind of an answer. But I still would love to find a better solution and you may shed a light on this.emp  pWhen creating an observer in Magento, the method that is responsible for dispatching it and calling the function that has been configured in the observers declaration in a modules config.xml file is codeMageCoreModelAppdispatchEventcode.p  pIn this method, there is this codebit which gathers observers information p  precodeforeach eventConfiggtobserversgtchildren as obsNamegtobsConfig      observers[obsName]  array         type  gt stringobsConfiggttype,         model gt obsConfiggtclass  stringobsConfiggtclass  obsConfiggtgetClassName,         methodgt stringobsConfiggtmethod,         args  gt arrayobsConfiggtargs,       codepre  pThis codebit means that one may declare an lt args  node in an observer like this p  precodelteventsgt     lteventtoobservegt         ltobserversgt             ltobservernamegt                 lttypegtsingletonlttypegt                 ltclassgtNamespaceModuleModelObserverClassltclassgt                 ltmethodgtobserverMethodltmethodgt                  ltargsgt                     ltargnamegtargvalueltargnamegt                 ltargsgt              ltobservernamegt         ltobserversgt     lteventtoobservegt lteventsgt codepre  pLater in the codeMageCoreModelAppdispatchEventcode, we can find some code that is responsible for calling the observers methods and passing the codeobservercode object as argument.p  pBut, if I am correct, no code sets the codeobservers[obsName][args]code value nor to the codeeventcode object, nor to the codeobservercode object. Result is the lt args  node from the observer declaration is not accessible in the observers called method codeNamespaceModuleModelObserverClassobserverMethodcode in my previous example.p  pMy first bet was to try to get the lt args  node using something like thisp  precodeargs  array MagegetConfiggtgetXpathevents . observergtgetEventgtgetName . observers . observergtgetName . args codepre  pBut, how disappointing, the codenamecode variable which is also used in codeMageCoreModelAppdispatchEventcode for the profiler is also not passed to the codeobservercode object... So codeobservergtgetNamecode is not returning any data.p  pSo I ended up creating a helper method that any oberver method can call in order to retrieve its lt args  node. You can find the gist of this helper and how to use it herep  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.com3312869 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com3312869ap  pIt would be so easier to have something like this in codeMageCoreModelAppdispatchEventcode codeobservergtsetMethodArgsobs[args]code allowing to use codeobservergtgetMethodArgscode in the observer method...p  pOr maybe did I miss something that allows us to retrieve the lt args  node but Im not sure as, searching thru the Core code, I didnt find any lt args  node meaning that Magento does not use this feature in its Core.p  pSo, now, the question is... strongdo you have an easy and Magento Core way to retrieve lt args  from an observer declaration strongp

Negative 7158 pWe are presently using TFS 2010 to manage our Source ControlMS shop so it was the default choice.p  pWe have no problems with it for our standalone projects. However we have a core product that we bespoke on a per client basis. Many clients require quite significant customizations, others only a few minor tweaks.p  pWe are finding that it is a nightmare. We basically have a Team Project which contains the Core Product. If a client needs no changes they just get the core product deployed. If they ask for changes we branch the core product team project and start working on that.p  pSo a single file needing changes requires then we branch the whole product. Are we doing this wrong I kind of pictured we would create a branch that contains differences from the main product that each client needs. Then basically the client would get the core  any changes they require. Then if we add to the core or change it then they just get that automatically.p  pWe are constantly developing the core so we seemed to spend our lives merging changes into all the branched projects. We presently have 5 clients but have 1520 in the pipeline in the next year. However this would seem totally unmanageable given the work we are doing on 5. Our lives as programmers seem to be just merge after merge.  Now this is partly as the product is quite new so there is a lot of churn for core. However we will always want to keep developing core. The problem is none of us have ever worked on a project like this so we just have no idea if this is how we should be handling it.p  pDoes anyone have any thoughtsReally appreciate any suggestions as this whole corebranchendless merge makes us sad. Someone suggested to one of my colleagues that git would help we would look at anything.p  pThanksp

But if I do cleanup then the client receives a disconnect before the connection is even established. p  pSo my question is Do I have to check somehow whether the socket is ready before doing a recv in order to get the correct return value from itp  pMost of the information I have been able to find was inconclusive. I found a references to select but it seems to block until there is a status change on the socket  but I need the socket to be nonblocking. p  pWhat Im looking for is just the intuitive behavior that if there is data, it is read to the buffer and recv returns number of bytes read, if there is no data it returns 1 and if the socket is disconnected then it should return 0. p  pDo I have to do anything else to the socket before calling recv to make it work as expectedp

Negative 7158 pI have few configuration settings for a Windows Service. Those settings are kept on database and expected to be picked up every time the Timer ticks and behave accordingly. The reason is that, User should be able to change those settings from GUI screen and Service should act based on the new settings from database  without the need of restarting the servicep  pHowever the issue is, many times the service is required to be restarted to behave correctly based on the new values in database.p  pCan anyone help in identifying.. what could be the possible reason Why the service is not working without being restartedp  pThanks in advance.p  pSarojp

Negative 7158 pIn the method that get called when a notification is executedp  precode voidapplicationUIApplication application didReceiveLocalNotificationUILocalNotification notification codepre  pIs there a way to discover whether the notification came from the user tapping an alert in the notification center, or whether the alert was received while the app was runningp  pThe reason is I want to direct the user to a specific page when they tap an alert.

Negative 7158 pIs it proper that I have a Button which basically passes a NSManagedObject to a segue to load the next view, in the next view I load a child object of the parent NSManaged object. When i destroy that controller the NSManagedObject is still retained by the original button along with children. I assume it get released the next time I load that same data, because it overwrites that property of the NSManaged object. But is it bad that it retains all these child objects or is that normalp  pShould  Can i manually release these children by setting the property to nil at some pointp  pEDITp  pLet me give some more context to what I am seeing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEsy0A.png altInstrumentsp  pContents of [Brand pages]p  precode NSArray  pages      NSLog, [self edetail]    if [self edetail]  nil       NSArray pgs  [[[self edetail] pages] allObjects]     return [pgs sortedArrayUsingDescriptors[NSArray arrayWithObject[NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKeysortorder ascendingYES]]]      return [NSArray array]  codepre  pLets say i have a NSArray of objectA which were a NSSet which i pulled from coredata and sorted. Then I iterate over each objectA in the Array and create a custom button class which has a property set to objectA. When the button is clicked i send a message up to my UINavigationController to segue to a page that uses that ObjectA to pull a certain child arrayset of ObjectA and display the data in a custom grid. According to instruments when I pop that UIViewController that i had passed ObjectA to, ObjectA is still retaining those child object, and ObjectA is still retained by my button. Is this really a bad design It doesnt seem any worse than if my RootViewController was retaining a NSArray of those object and calling them by index.p  pI feel like through the course of using the app tho, i may end up having actual references to every piece of data in core data, thats what worries me, that these children arent released even after I dont need them.p

Negative 7158 pIm trying to upload an image into a database as a blob using PHP with mysqli.  If I just try to insert the image name using a query, it works just fine and a new row with the name is created blob is null.  Once I start trying to upload the blob via a form into the database using a query and jquery functions, a new row is created, but the blob shows 0 B.  The first bit of code is the html form.  The second is the php file that is called once the form is submitted.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Negative 7158 pI have a website with different pages. Each page should have a Like button and a Share button to Facebook only. p  pFirst I didnt find any mention of a Share button in the Facebook Documentation. Can you point me a guide or referencep  pHowever the big problem is that I need to sum likes from all the shares, and the likes on the page too. For example if 10 users clicked on Like on the page. Then some shared to their profile, and someone liked that too, I need to show a total of 10  the likes on the profiles. Is there a readymade Facebook API function to do this Or do I need to track each share and sum manually all the referencesp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 7158 pI am trying to make a master timer independent of the frame rate for a multiplayer game in Flash. p  pThis timer is maintained at the client end.

Negative 7158 pI am attempting to allow a user the ability to cycle through all the text fields inside a table view two text fields per cell with arrow keys.p  pCurrently what I am doing is setting a tag to each textfield, and adding each text field into an array.  Once the user clicks a text field to start editing it, some arrow buttons appear and when they press an arrow key, I grab the tag of the currently selected text field, use that as the location for the array, pull out the text field they want to go to, and set the new text field as the first responder.p  pThe problem with this however, lies in the fact that my cells are reused.  So if the user scrolls a cell offscreen, when it comes back, the cell in row 1 of the table may have the textfields with tags 15 and 16, and those are the end of the textfield array breaking my arrow keys.  And the more they scroll, the more the textfields get out of order.p  pIs it possible to accomplish what I am trying to do while still maintaining reusable cells  or will this just simply require that I do not reuse themp  pHere is my arrow code...p  precode voidarrowPressedHandlerUIButton button  UITextField newTextFieldSelection  tags are offset by 2 because I have use tag 1 for something else, and tag 0 cannot be used int realLocation  selectedTextField.tag  2   arrow code.  for an up button i go back 2 slots in the array, right is  1 in array etc etc  try     switch button.tag          case NumericKeyboardViewUpArrow             newTextFieldSelection  [textFields objectAtIndexrealLocation  2]             [newTextFieldSelection becomeFirstResponder]             break         case NumericKeyboardViewLeftArrow             newTextFieldSelection  [textFields objectAtIndexrealLocation  1]             [newTextFieldSelection becomeFirstResponder]             break         case NumericKeyboardViewRightArrow             newTextFieldSelection  [textFields objectAtIndexrealLocation 1]             [newTextFieldSelection becomeFirstResponder]             break         case NumericKeyboardViewDownArrow             newTextFieldSelection  [textFields objectAtIndexrealLocation  2]             [newTextFieldSelection becomeFirstResponder]             break         default             break       catch NSException e      return   codepre

Right.   No thanks.p  pAnother one, OpenLike has a dead webserver.p  pA search on SourceForge has come up empty.  I tried searching for the names like AddThis, AddToAny, Sharethis, followed by searches to stumbleupon, reddit, digg, google plus.

Negative 7158 pI am creating a GWT Application where I am displaying a list of elements, using a codeCellListcode and a codeListDataProvidercode. The data I want to display in each Cell consists only of two strings. I created a custom Cell which extends from codeAbstractCellcode. To create my custom Cell I used UIBinder and created the UI based on HTML. Each Cell contains the two strings and a button. Clicking the button removes the element from the binded list. With my resolution, about 20 elements are visible, so I set the page size to 30 to have a little buffer when the user wants to scroll down. Here how the first three elements look likep  pa hrefhttpimageshack.usf201listox.png relnofollowhttpimageshack.usf201listox.pnga br  p  pNo problems when running the deployed application on tomcat. But running in DevelopmentMode I noticed following problem when I am removing elementsp  ul liI click on the Remove element button of the first elementli liI click a second time on the Remove element button of the first element while the first element still is visibleli liThe first element is removed from the listli liThe second element is also removed from the listli ul  pI tried the same withe the deployed version, but it was impossible for me to click the Remove element button of the first element twice, because it was removed too quick. So I increased the amount of displayed elements to 500, which resulted to the same problem. I switched to a slower system AMD GT40R with 1GHz and same happened to me setting the page size to 50 or more.p  pTo dig further into this problem, I added a codeNativePreviewHandlercode and scheduled a codeScheduleCommandcode via codeScheduler.get.scheduleDeferredcode in the codeonBrowserEventcode method of my custom Cell to see what is happening.

Is there a way to determine when the rendering is done or to disable userinput while the browser is busyp  pstrongMy current solutionworkaroundstrong I disable the buttons when an element is removed. So the clicks are ignored. To emulate that the browser finished rendering I added a certain amount of time 50ms after the codeScheduleCommandcode is executed. Then I enable all buttons again. This works for now, but if someday the browser buffers the input for more than 50ms the problem occurs again.p  pGreetings from Austria...p  pPS Please excuse me if I did something wrong regarding format etc. it is my first question on StackOverflow.

The listings should now list local time as well as time relative to the viewing user. I also have to do some processing on the events that are happening right now so Ill need to compare the time with current time conveniently. p  pIve gone through Djangos documentation of timezone but Im not sure if Ill need to store  timezone information for event in a separate field or can I store the timezone be right within DatetimeField If I cant store it in DatetimeField, will I have to manually perform the conversions each time before displaying I have some cronjobs too so a middleware approach to set timezone might not be useful.p

Can anyone help me out of this mess p  pTo make matters worse, all of this only happens on the server under Linux. None of these raises an exception in my development environment on Windows. Bonus points for an explanation as to why that is, just because Im curious. I suspect it has to do with a different default encoding. However, they all are not accepted by the server. What does work on Windows is if I drop the codesaxutils.escapecode and then hand a proper unicode object to suds. This however still results in the same codeUnicodeDecodeErrorcode on Linux.p  pemUpdateem I started debugging this on Windows where it works fine, and in the line 827 of httplib.py, it indeed tries to concatenate the unicode object codemsgcode containing the HTTP headers and the str object codemessagebodycode, leading to the implicit unicode decoding with the incorrect encoding. I guess it just happens to not fail on Windows for some reason. I dont understand why suds tries to send a str object when I put a unicode object in at the top.p

For various reasons, I am now looking at publishing a nonMAS release as well.p  pObviously, the MAS and nonMAS releases will share 95 of a common code base. In fact, about the only parts they will not share in common will be receipt checking MAS release, and license keys  autoupdates nonMAS release.p  pThis brings me to the gist of my question  presumably the right way to do this would be to maintain two separate branches in git How can I easily make sure the two branches stay in sync without worrying about bleeding the receipt checking and license key code between the two versions What about xcode project management Suppose I add a file to the MAS project, is there an easy way to make it show up in the non MAS projectp  pPlease let me know if any clarification is needed.p  pThanks in advance.p

We end up typing the Username and password after which we are served different URLs.

Negative 7158 pI want to see all values of attributes of any tag in HTML. Even if they are set in the tag or not in HTML. For examplep  precodeltdiv stylebackgroundcolor000000gt ltpgtabcltpgt ltdivgt codepre  pI want to know how I can find the background color of codeltpgtcode. The reason is because there can be many ways to set a value of an attribute in a tag. For example the value can be set in an external css file, javascript file, could be set by a parent tag, could be set in css in same page etc. But is always difficult to track to set value such as font size by reading whole code and opening its all files referenced in HTML code. I wanted to know value of font of a text enclosed in a codeltpgtcode but it is very difficult to search on whole page and its associated .js and .css file to search to find out from where the codeltpgtcode tag is picking its font values. So, I wanted to know that if I select the text in a browser then is there any way possible to show all the attributes and its values of selected text. Just like Visual Studio, Netbeans, Eclipse IDE etc. show all properties of any draganddrop object in the design interface.p

If someone were to want to use my Locations list for themselves, they would simply link their xxFormY to my 24locations, and be able to use the same function to pull the appropriate info.  Its better than me naming every column in my table 24xxxx, and forcing them to do the same.  Thanksp

Negative 7158 pa hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsmzfjn06e5x8lzz3WordFind.zip relnofollowMy full code hereap  pIm learning Android development and Im trying to create a simple wordsearch game.  First, I created a LetterTile class, it represents one letter on the screen and this class have the method to draw itself.p  pThen I created a LetterMap class, which is a matrix of LetterTile if we use LetterMap6, 6 it will draw on screen a matrix 6x6 of LetterTile.p  pNow what I want to do is, when I touch one of the LetterTile object, I can do something with it. At this moment, I cant do that because in the MainGamePanel I initialize the LetterMap object, not LetterTile object. p  pYou can see in my code that if I initialize LetterTile object, I just use the onTouchEvent to handle the problem, but now I dont know how to do with the LetterMapp  pDid I do something wrong Or my approach to this game is not correctp  pAny help would be appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 7158 pWe have the following problem, which is proving non trivial to solve.p  pWe are building an MSI installer from within our Asp.Net WebForms application.p  pFirstly we build an exe.config file with user specific vars and then a vdproj file which is passed to devenv to build the actual installer.p  pThis process runs fine when using the debugger but fails when running under IIS.  So instinctively we thought this must be a permissions issue but even setting the application as my own account which is running visual studio it still fails. Could there be another permission that is being missed, even though the compiler is defiantly being called p  pInspecting the visual studio log provides very little information and having had a dig around using the rather non descriptive error has proved to be fruitless.p  precode Starting prebuild validation for project xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.Installer    Prebuild validation for project xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.Installer completed   Build started Project xxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.Installer, Configuration Release      Building file Dxxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.InstallerCustomerInstallers9999    12349237xxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.Installer.msi...

Negative 7158 pWe would like to implement a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMultiversionconcurrencycontrol relnofollowMultiversion concurrency controla for our Symfony2 webapp.p  pThis means that on any event, no codeUPDATEcode is performed on the database, but only codeINSERTcodes. As I havent found any native support by Symfony2 for this requirement, I made up my mind how this could be implemented manually.p  pBesides the regular ID primary key of each entity e.g. a codeUsercode, we add another entity property, e.g. another codeuserIDcode. So on each change of the user attributes, we could simply codeINSERTcode another row for the user, which then has another codeIDcode, but the same codeuserIDcode.p  pThe entity could then always be identified by the specific additional entity ID.p  pBut there are a couple of problems that come up with this solution The regular entity ID is the primary key and therefore the identifier for all relations to this entity. One could also try to create combined primary keys e.g. codeIDcode plus codetimestampcode, or codeIDcode plus codeentityIDcodestrike, but Symfony2Doctrine2 is not constructed to support combined primary keysstrike.p  pSo how would you approach to implement a MVCC in Symfony2Doctrine2 Do you see a way to handle this Or would you recommend to use a separate history table that keeps track of all changesp

Negative 7158 pI have an interesting question that very well may be answered with Do it another way.p  pI have a function that iterates through a list with a for loop. I call the function within itself on certain parameters, and keep iterating through the list from the point it was at. The issue is I would like to be able to jump out of the recursive call back into the top function but keep track of how far I went in the list and go on from there.p  pBasically I want something like thisp  precodedef iteratelistlistA     dictA       for pos,item in enumeratelistA         if item  1             dictA[pos]  iteratelistlistA[pos]             At this point I want to go back to for loop like continue does except I want              to be at the pos I was at when I left the sub function             continue  Dont think continue is what I want but its the closest thing I could              find so I left it in for now         elif item  2             return dictA         else             dictA[pos]  item     return dictA  dictFinal  iteratelistoriginallist codepre  pSo the end result is a dictionary of whatever is in the list integers in this example but not always except for some points when the key points to a sub dictionary.

Negative 7158 pI am looking for a way to have my websites search bar change background color when it is hovered over. Currently, there are two main elements that make it up. There is the text box itself, and the submit button. When the user hovers over the text box element, I have programmed it to change the background color to a lighter shade. What I want tho is to have not only the text box background color to change, but also the submit button background to change as well, so that it looks as if the search bar is all one element. Also, I would like to have it when the user hovers over the submit button to change both background colors as well.

Negative 7158 pIm hoping to write a simple FTPlike app, including both the client and the server in a Microsoft environment. I say FTPlike because I wont need to follow FTP protocol, I just want to build a client that can send a directory  file string to a server, and then have that server either send back the contents of the file, or send the file itself. p  pRight now my pseudocode is something like thisp  pFTP Client  open socket   send file string to server  other functionality as desired  receive responsep  pFTP Server  open socket  new thread for every incoming connection  receives file string  checks to see if file string is in the right format and if the file exists  sends response to client to tell if string was valid  either open up and read text files, or transfer the file itself  send file or contents of file back to clientp  pDoes that general skeleton make sense Is there anything obvious that I might be missing I was thinking that I might need one socket each for the status and transfer. Any tips or general direction on how to proceed further with this project would be appreciated.p

Negative 7158 pMy PostgreSQL database has table with entities which can be active and inactive  its determined by isActive column value.

Inadequate because of all the implementation in these base classes that doesnt make sense to duplicate into many subclasses.p  pIm reading some stuff on delegation or composition, and I dont know how to apply this here. Basically my thought processes have been patterned by my C experience. strongWhat is the path of least resistance to convert my C class structure to Javastrongp  pI can fill out the base classes more if needed, but hopefully not necessary.p
Negative 7158 pi have a problem with conversion of entitys with a version. I made a simple example to explain my problem because the real application is to big and contains many unnecessary things.p  pstrongSituationstrong I have a web application with primefaces and openjpa. I have 20 components autocompletes  selectedmenues that needs a converter and they use persistence entitys. p  pstrongInformationsstrong I only want use jsf,primefaces for it Nothing special like omnifaces or something else. The strongQuestionstrong is at bottom. This is only testcode. It is strongNOTstrong complete and there are some strange things.

One converter for all, i thought that was a good solution. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21837334pautocompleteforaglobalentityconverter2183739921837399pautocomplete for a global Entity Convertera.

It will be replaced with a new uuid if the leader is in the persons  list, too. The leader will be set to null or convert exception because the uuid does not exists anymore in the hashmap.

Negative 7158 pI was hoping for some advice on where to proceed with a hanging issue we are having.p  pOur current setup is as follows. We have developed a Kentico 7 site as a replacementupgrade to an existing extranet site which we have used successfully since 1999.  The existing site was written in classic asp and used a dll to communicate with a Visual FoxPro backend that returned the required html as a string.  We have now used this same mechanism within a new Kentico site to return the same html tables, listings  etc. and we simply restyled the css etc. to match our new framework. The framework used the aspx model and the dll call exists in a user control which is added to the relevant aspx pages which need to show the FoxPro content. This all works fine and both systems match exactly. p  pWe are now in the pilot phase of deployment and are starting to experience the following problems.p  pWhen 2 or more users hit the same page containing the dll user control, at the same time, one user will hang. There is no error message in the browser and the hanging user cannot clear this with a refresh but has to close the browser. In testing I have got 3 users to get the page to appear and the 4th to hang but there is no consistency in results and this may just be timing. The main issue is that any concurrent calls to the dll results in hanging so we cant have more than 23 users accessing the content pages simultaneously. When the hanging occurs the event viewer on the server shows the following application errorp  pFaulting application name w3wp.exe, version 7.5.7601.17514, time stamp 0x4ce7a5f8br Faulting module name vfp9r.dll, version 9.0.0.5815, time stamp 0x4713a718br Exception code 0xc0000005br Fault offset 0x001d9b1ebr Faulting process id 0xd58br Faulting application start time 0x01cf7366d3a89ddabr Faulting application path CWindowsSysWOW64inetsrvw3wp.exebr Faulting module path CProgram Files x86Common FilesMicrosoft SharedVFPvfp9r.dllbr Report Id 9365d933df5a11e3ada3000c29e9b4d4  p  pOne area which may be related is that the existing site runs on IIS6 on a 2003 server but the app pool is configured to use 6 worker processes in a web garden. From the forums I see that Kentico does not allow more than 1 worker process so this may be the bottleneck. The new site is running on IIS7.5 on a 2008r2 Server. If I configure the new site with 6 Worker processes the problem is greatly reduced in that I had 8 simultaneous hits with only 1 browser hanging  and this worked when the link was clicked again.  My queries is that if I cant use more than one worker process is there any other way I can configure the iis  apppool or site settings to prevent the locking  hanging error. If it is a locking issue can I change the setup to queue everything at the expense of speed and just increase the server spec to compensate.p  pSo far I have tried the following The dll is 32 bit multithreaded and I have tried changing the MTA setting with no effect.br Changed the Disable Overlapped Recycle setting to true with no effect.  p  pI am no expert in IIS config so any advice on where to start would be grateful.p

Negative 7158 pI have a Java application in which I maintain set of IPs of my other servers in a hash map in memory. The hash map contains mapping between servers instance ids to servers ip address. I also maintain these servers information in a database for persistence.  p  pI am trying to solve a simple problem where I just need to cache the servers information in memory for faster access. So I have used hashmap for that. And I need to make sure that the server information in memory are NOT stale and all the servers in the cache are responsive.p  pSo I have created two separate background daemon threads wherep  ul lione thread which gets each entry from the hashmap and pings all of them. If any of the server is not responsive, then it removes that entry from the hashmap.li liAnother thread basically synchronizes the database entries  with this hashmap cache. Hence it queries all the entries database, and removes the entries in hashmap which are not there in DB and for new of the entries in DB, it pings each of them and adds to the hashmap.li ul  pHere first thread runs frequently lets say for evey 15 seconds and second DB thread runs for every 5 minutes. p  pSince both the threads are updating the cache here, I have used ConcurrentHashMap since it will be synchronized. Even then When I read multiple articles, documentations and some of the stackoverflow posts, I see multiple threads updating the hashmap is going to be risky, like when one thread is iterating over the hashmap, other thread may get triggered and start updating the hashmap.  p  pSo How Can I solve this using different approach here so that I dont disturb the JVM in terms of application performance, time and space complexities and make sure that I have only responsive server entries in my hashmap all most all the time.p

Negative 7158 pI am developing an application C which calculates the cost of a complex system. This system consists of many parts and subparts and each part may have different calculation algorithms. Initially, I planned to create a set of classes containing only properties as a representation of system parts. In addition to these classes I would create a set of dedicated cost calculators. It would resemble procedural programming and anemic domain model antipattern. So I thought of another way implementing costcalculating logic inside those partentities. But then unit testing would be more difficult because higher parts depends on lower parts cost. So basically I have these two options assuming my system is a pizzap  pa Calculation logic in external services.

I just want to know why, on my browser, the text for the content div appears where I intend it to but the blue area that would be its background appears directly on top of the preceding div, as if the code for the content div is within that div which it isnt, it comes directly after the closing tag for that div. All I want is to have the header, scheduleContainer, and content divs appear in the order theyre written in the code. Feel free to criticize my decisions or recommend a different approach all together. I am very amateur and just want to learn.p
Negative 7158 pI have an old implementation of PayFlow LINK using Classic ASP and hosted pages.  My data is passed in name value pairs as hidden fields on a form.  I need to implement the Secure Token process.  The only example I can find uses CURL in an Iframe  not very helpful to me.p  pMy understanding is that once a user clicks submit, I could pass the data name, addr, amount, etc.. along with a SecureTokenId that I create, to Payflow.  In return I would receive a SecureTokenId.  I would then do a 2nd call that sends my account along with the SecureTokenId and that Payflow would use the secureTokenId to retrieve the detail name, addr, amount, etc. Hopefully thats a correct interpretation.p  pAny helpexamples  especially in Payflow LINK and Classic ASP would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks, Bobp

Negative 7158 pI am currently filling out a form on a web page using Pythons Mechanize.  However, when I click on some parts of the form, they bring up hidden divs and display those to the user as a popout to get more information.  These divs exist in the page source so I can see them in Mechanize, but they are not actually part of a form element and therefore cant be filled in with Mechanize that I know of.p  pDoes anyone know how to either fillin nonform elements with Mechanize, or is there another library that can be used in conjunction with Mechanize to achieve the desired results  I know many people will want to suggest Selenium, but this code is run on a headless server and therefore Selenium is not a viable option since there is no browser.

Negative 7158 pI have four queues that each have multiple processesthreads that are interdependent in the following wayp  ol liQueue 1 is reading a file from disk and copying to RAMli liQueue 2 takes the file in RAM and performs an operation on itli liQueue 3 takes the result of Queue 2 and performs a separate operation on itli liQueue 4 writes the end result back to diskli ol  pI would like these 4 queues to operate in parallel as much as possible with the caveat that Queue 2 has to wait for Queue 1 to place at least one processthread on it and similarly queue 2 has to place items on queue 3, and queue 3 on 4.p  pWhat is the best way in Python to go about implementing this both for the queue and for the threadprocess implementationp  pWill queue 2 and queue 3 block each other due to GIL if I use threads I read that IO and compute can still happen in parallel so I am ok even if Queue 124 can work in parallel, and queue 3 is sequential with queue 2.p

Negative 7158 pI have an ASP.NET MVC Razor website which is supposed to be live in multiple countries having different cultures and hence the languages. My Development team is concerned about english only and whole text on UI pages is also written in plain english. I want this english text to be converted into culture specific language. Im using resource file to manage the strings on my website.p  pOne way is to create multiple resource files based on each language and then using each file based on specific culture. This thing needs to be managed manually. If someone has done this thing please come up with any reference or any sample code for this implementation.p  pIf there is any way where I can automate this thing then it will be best way to go for a multi lingual website. Like as culture can be easily detected by user IP address and based on the culture I should be able to convert all english based text into current culture specific language.p

My problem with the approach above is that if I use codelang racketcode it isnt lazy, and with codelang lazycode codestringsplitcode isnt defined.

On the estimation, Kritzman et al sayp  pemIn order to estimate the absorption ratio, we use aem [rolling] emwindow of 500 days to estimate the covariance matrix and eigenvectors, and we fix the number of eigenvectors at approximately 15 the number of assets in our sample.emp  pIn order to compute this in R Ive tried the following codesp  precodermlistlsallTRUE libraryquadprog   read data set consisting of daily returns data lt read.table10IndustryPortfoliosDaily.txt, headerTRUE Ret lt data[,2ncoldata]100 names lt cNoDur,Durbl,Manuf,Enrgy,HiTec,            Telcm,Shops,Hlth,Utils,Other colnamesRet lt names   lookback period in number of days rolling window lb.period lt 500 nRow lt nrowRet nCol lt ncolRet n lt nRowlb.period  ar lt rep0,n  reserve space for daily absorption ratio fori in 1n   define rolling window   start lt i   end lt ilb.period1   ret lt Ret[startend,]   cov lt covret   eigenval lt eigencovvalues   sumeigenval lt sumeigenval   abs lt eigenval[12]sumeigenval  variance explained by 2 eigenvectors   ar[i] lt ar[i]abs  daily variance explained, out of sample period  codepre  pWhen I run this program I get the following warning message number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length, and end up with a ar[i] vector consisting of emnem equal numbers.p  pIm pretty confident that this is the right way to compute the explained variance for 2 eigenvectorsp  precode  ret lt Ret[startend,]   cov lt covret   eigenval lt eigencovvalues   sumeigenval lt sumeigenval   abs lt eigenval[12]sumeigenval codepre  pbut my question is how I compute this number on a daily basis using a rolling window approach, as Kritzman has done it in his article.

That is because Im trying to expand on the algorithm and testing conditions. One of the things I want to do is insert a loop condition where unless a user insert a valid integer the user will be prompted to insert a valid integer, once its inserted, the program continues on. This happens on 3 occasions at the beginning.p  pAlso I have made the integer between a range of specific numbers. How would I be able to improve upon the algorithm so that a user can insert any number, and one of the conditions upon that is that one side of a triangle cannot be longer than the other two sides otherwise the triangle is invalid. p  pIf a user inserts for example p  psideA as  10 sideB as  20  then sideC cannot be more than 30. Likewise the condition to be where SideA cannot be more than sideB and sideC combined, as well as sideC and sideA not been higher than sideB.p  pIn my code Ive currently got it set to make sure a user can only insert a valid integer, and thus will not allow a user to insert any character except an integer. p  pAt the end of the algorithm and also in the code, ive got a ELSEIF statement in case the user inserts anything invalid. But since I am trying to make it error proof from the beginning, what would I have to add so that I can remove the final ELSEIF statement.p  pAnd finally I want to add a section to the algorithm where the result is After user has got answer, the user is then asked to either try again or simply exit. p  pThe code is pasted below if you wish to compile, check it out and make some suggestions based on what Im trying to make the program do. p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt int main       Declaring triangle variable sides     int sideA   int sideB   int sideC   char ch    printfLets explore triangles Please insert a value for side A of your triangle.n   printf Ranging from 115cm.n   whilescanfd, ampsideA  1        printfYou inserted an incorrect value.

Negative 7158 pI am trying to use BouncyCastle classes to encrypt and decrypt a password. I have written a test program and generated a test keycert in PEM format as well as DER format.

When we were comparing much fewer competitions, I was using XMLReader to pull out and parse the Competition block, then converting each competition element into a SimpleXML object, but with 600 competitions, I need to find a way of reducing how much Im downloading.p  pThe more I look at it, the more I think this XML isnt fit for the task, so this is my last try before requesting a change to the API generating the XML or Ill try to stream smaller datasets somehow.p
Negative 7158 pIm kind of new to rails and I have read and read about hasmanythrough relationships and I still dont get how to manipulate that Im working on an app that has three models courses, topics, weeks. A course has many topics through weeks and topic can be in many courses also through weeks.p  pNow my question.  Id like to, when I create a topic, be able to add some fields for weeks and create also some of the attributes of the week thats the easy part.  Then I want to be able to, in the weeks form or new view, select one course and select several topics that can be on that course.  Of course the topics are already created and the courses as well  How can I add the courses id to de weeks rows that hold the selected topics idp

All next new instances would strongnotstrong create an other emModelem, because it was already created in the prototypal function.p  pIs that correctp

Negative 7158 pIm trying to send the reading distance of an HCSR04 sensor to an Android app, using Bluetooth. I succesfully managed to send values from many other sensor to the app, but when it comes to sending the HCSR04 reding, a strange behaviour happens. To send the reading over BT I use a simple codeSerial.printlvaluecode command, which also display the reading on the PC serial monitor. The strange thing is this if the bluetooth module is disconnected, the readings are correct, but as soon as I connect the Bluetooth module on the breadboard a JYMCU, the reading start to get apparently random, even I watch at them on the PC monitor, and not from the app. I still havent figured out if this problem is hardware or software related.p  pI also tried to disconnect all the other sensors and components from the circuit, using a vary basic sketch, but the result is the same as soon as I insert the Bluetooth module  even if the data is not sent to the Android app, I start getting random distance values.

Negative 7158 pUsually in statistical hypothesis testing, we randomly split some unit into treatment group and control group, and we test if there are difference between treatment group and control group based on ttest.

Negative 7158 pSo ive been writing a game in swift using SpriteKit, and im having trouble understanding how variables are handled in swift. Im trying to update a variable I declare at the beginning of my GameScene class again in the touchesBegan function that comes later.

Im wondering if there is a way to update a variable that is declared early on in the Class filep  pIs what im doing something that makes sense Does anyone have an idea of how I can fix my situation My code is very long and would not make sense to post all of it, so here are the important partsp  pHere is where I declare the rotation variable Im trying to update and use later on.p  precodeclass GameScene SKScene      let rotation Int  188400 codepre  pHere is where the rotation variable is used in the didMoveToView functionp  precodelet rotate  SKAction.rotateToAngleCGFloat188400, duration NSTimeInterval60000 anchorNode.runActionrotate codepre  pHere is where I attempt to update the rotation variable in the touchesBegan functionp  precode override func touchesBegantouches SetltNSObjectgt, withEvent event UIEvent       Called when a touch begins       if rotation  188400           printlnSetting rotation backwards          let rotation  188400      else          printlnSetting rotation forwards         let rotation  188400      codepre  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 7158 pIm trying to create an HtmlHelper method on a stronglytyped view, where the viewmodel is a generic.  But theres a complication.  I want to simplify my syntax so I can specify a member expression of a property on my viewmodel.  Consider the following.p  precodepublic interface ViewModelltTgt      T Model  get set    public class DocViewModel  ViewModelltDocumentgt       public IEnumerableltstringgt Options  get set      public Document Model  get set    public class Document      public string Name  get set      public string Value  get set   codepre  pNow, I can easily create a helper that references the viewmodel itself, and use it like sop  precodemodel DocViewModel ltdivgt     Html.DoSomethingvm gt vm.Options     Html.DoSomethingElsevm gt vm.Model.Name     Html.DoSomethingYetAgainvm gt vm.Model.Value ltdivgt codepre  pBut Id like to be able to pass simply an expression on the Model, like sop  precodemodel DocViewModel ltdivgt     Html.DoSomethingvm gt vm.Options     Html.DoSomethingElsevm gt vm.Name     Html.DoSomethingYetAgainvm gt vm.Value ltdivgt codepre  pNow, I can write the helper in such a way that I can do this if I explicitly reference the type parameters in my callsp  precodemodel DocViewModel ltdivgt      Html.DoSomethingltDocumentgtvm gt vm.Name ltdivgt codepre  pBut that sort of defeats the purpose of what Im going after.  It seems like I should be able to write an HtmlHelper that can exploit the fact that the view is stronglytyped on DocViewModel, which itself is a ViewModel, and that Html returns p  precodeHtmlHelperltDocViewModelgt HtmlHelperltViewModelltDocumentgtgt codepre  pso that the typeparam that Document represents is known implicitly, and so that I can writep  precodepublic static string DoSomethingElseltTModel, TPropertygtthis HtmlHelperltViewModelltTModelgtgt helper, ExpressionltFuncltTModel, TPropertygtgt expression       return Whatever  codepre  pbut that conversion cant be done.  So is there any way I can do this  Or am I just going to have to live with the ugly syntaxp  pEdit Changed incorrect references to KoViewModel to ViewModelp  pEdit again  Also, the point of making ViewModel generic is so that I can declare any other type of ViewModelp  precodepublic class ProgramViewModel  ViewModelltProgramgt      other stuff     public Program Model  get set   public class Program      public string Something  get set      other properties I want to reference  codepre  pand in another view p  precodemodel ProgramViewModel ltdivgt     Html.DoSomethingElsevm gt vm.Something ltdivgt codepre  pAgain, Id like to be able to dereference properties on both the views viewmodel, as well as the viewmodels Model property, without having to explicitly reference types in my method calls.  p  pThe problem with the method I have defined above is that there can apparently be no implicit conversion between HtmlHelper and HtmlHelper, so that the compiler cannot resolve the Html call in the view as the one above  does not contain a definition for  and no extension method blah blah blah.  Explicit casts all around would make that work, certainly, but thats what Im trying to avoid.p

Negative 7158 pI have implemented an AB test using Google Experiments.  However, we did not want the AB test to start for a period of time and therefore put a date driven condition on showing the B variant.  Out of curiosity I started the experiment anyway before the B variant go live date.  Hence, at the start of the experiment, Google Experiments was choosing a variation for me A or B, see code below and regardless of the chosen variation, I would show variant A since we hadnt hit the go live date yet.  This effectively gives me an AA test which I expected to be a dead heat.

Negative 7158 pIm attempting to mirror a GitHub repository wiki to a local static website and running into some issues that make this more complicated than I had hoped.p  pFirst, let me explain why so what Im trying to do may make more sense.p  pI have a private repo and an associated wiki that works wonderfully.  The development staff that already have GitHub credentials can easily create and share documentation using markdownformatted pages and everything is great.  The issue is that Id like to make this same documentation available to other internal resources for viewing only, not editing that may not have GitHub accounts and access to the private repo.p  pHeres what Ive tried to farp  ol lipCreate all docs in HTML so the wiki repo can easily be cloned and mirrored onto an internal website.p  pIssuesp  ol liI figured I could create basic HTML formatted pages in the GitHub wiki, but it appears that files with a .html extension are ignored.  I can create HTML formatted files with a .md extension that are processed as HTML, but this means I still need to convert the filenames when copying to the internal host.li liThis makes it more difficult to create the pages as they need to be written in HTML as opposed to something more simple such as MarkDown.li olli lipCreate the pages as usual through the GitHub wiki editor in Markdown and convert to a static site using Jekyll Ive tried to use Jekyll since I believe that is what GitHub uses on the backend, although this may be only for GitHub Pages, not the repo wikisp  pIssuesp  ol liJekyll expects files to have a Front Matter section that the GitHub wiki treats as normal text I cant find a way to have staticfiles in Jekyll treated as Markdown without including a FrontMatter section, Ive looked at the Generator plugin docs to see if I can make this work and it doesnt seem like I can.li liIf I could get 1 solved, links wont work properly as GitHub expects naked links and the Jekyll generated site will expect .html links.li olli ol  pI think the most likely approach would be to tailor the wiki to GitHubs approach and use a local build that will create the content that I want. Yes, I realize I could forego the entire GitHub Wiki and have only our own internal wiki as part of our codebuild structure, but Ill admit I like having the wiki as part of the GitHub infrastructure.p  pMy idea was to have our CI server poll the GitHub wiki for changes and publish to our internal site. Id be fine with some solution that includes extra files in the wiki repo that Jekyll could use that GitHub would ignore it seems as though GitHub ignores most files in the wiki repo without a proper file extension that it knows how to render. p  pThe best solution I can come up with is a script that will take the GitHub wiki files and create a Jekyllstyle site by prepending FrontMatter data for layout and formatting before running a Jekyll build.p  pBefore I go through that hassle, I was looking for alternative ideas on possibly using Jekyll plugins to automatically force things like Markdown generation and template usage on staticfiles.p  pAnybody have any ideas or an alternative to Jekyll that seems to fit into my master planp

Negative 7158 pI need to listen to POST requests on the codemailcode path toso that I can send emails via JS, without refreshing the page. I was thinking about an express nodejs server which will send the email when a POST request is made on codemailcode.p  pThe codegulp servecode task currently uses browserSync to display the application, but this only displays the static part of the site.  If I run codegulp servecode and then I run the codenode mail.jscode script which contains an express server, I get an codeEADDRINUSEcode error, because the express server is in conflict with browserSync, I think. p  pWhat can I do to overcome this errorp

Negative 7158 pI have a tableView and an array codelocationsArraycode. The locations array is filled on codeviewDidLoadcode from data in my CoreData. p  pI have implemented the reorder methods on the tableView and that works fine however I cant figure out how to save the reordered array back into CoreData.

Although this is obviously very costly resource wise it seems to just load the elements back into the array in a seemingly random order. p  pIs there an easy way to do this that I am missing or can you not store things in CoreData in a certain order p

Negative 7158 pI am writing a small piece of code to serialize classes to binary that can be deserialized into an object without knowing the type on the receiving side. The type is defined in the assembly, but you dont have to provide it in the method call e.g. codeDeserializeltMyTypegtcode. I want to create some sort of a dictionary that allows me to get a codeTypecode from an codeintcode, and the corresponding codeintcode from a codeTypecode. Is there an object in .Net that does thisp  pI currently have a class with two codeprivatecode dictionaries and some methods to handle and validate the addition and removal of the synchronized dictionaries. The problem is, thats what Im trying to avoid duplicating data.p  pEdit The solution proposed in the Potential duplicate is basically doing what I already am doing. Im asking if there is a special dictionary class already doing this, which would allow onetoone relations without duplicating every key and value.p
