When we change to Apache instead of IIS, we install Apache Web Agency Policy, when request a url, it redirect to OpenAm, after login to OpenAM it redirect back to the Web App, but inside header, itve just have codeiplanetDirectorycode token in cookie, and dont have codeuidcode info in header.p  pTomorrow we will setup the development environment again, so i will give detail about the setting and the log.p  pThanks you a lot.p  pOpenAM a hrefhttpopenam.forgerock.orgdocs.html relnofollowenter link description hereap

Positive 215 pAt our hosting provider we have a server running Windows Server 2012 with IIS 8.0, via VMWare. It hosts several web applications. In addition to that, FTP runs on port 21 on FileZilla Server. Since August this year, seemingly at random, the server sometimes refuses the connection on port 80 and 443 WSAECONNREFUSED. It does never refuse the connection on port 21. To give an illustration of how random this is It happened every day this week but it never happened the two weeks before that. We cant find anything in the IIS logging. The only thing we can find is that when connecting through port 80 or 443, even on the server itself on 127.0.0.1, it will usually work fine but sometimes WSAECONNREFUSED starts popping up right in between successful connections. Both we and our hosting provider so far dont have a clue what is causing it, other than that its suspicious that its happening on the ports that IIS is using, but IIS or the Windows event log will never report anything. Our hosting provider made a clone of this server on which we disabled most of the web applications. This clone exhibits the same behaviour, even at the same times. A third server, which is entirely new and runs Windows Server 2012 R2 does not show this behaviour. All three are on the same network. After two months of searching we still havent find anything. Any pointers are really appreciated, as these errors are a problem for both ourselves and our customers.p

Positive 215 pI have some thirdparty, nonthreadsafe code in a library that Ive wrapped in a WCF service for calling from my application.  This WCF service is hosted in IIS 7.5 with its own application pool.  I want to constrain it so that it only processes one request at a time in a worker process.  I want this so I can guarantee there wont be multiple requests being processed in parallel within a single worker process memory space at one time.p  pMy initial attempt was set the application pool to...p  ol liNOT use a web gardenli liRequest Limit  1li ol  pMy thinking with the request limit is that once IIS sends one request to the worker process, it would spin up a new worker process for the next request since the first process had now reached its maximum number of requests of 1.p  pIn practice this almost works.  However, I have found occasional instances where my logs clearly show concurrent requests being processed with the same process ID.  So I dont know if Request Limit is what I want, but it breaks down at certain close timings, or if Im entirely barking up the wrong tree.p  pUnfortunately, all of the official and unofficial documentation just repeats the same blurbp  blockquote   pMaximum number of requests an application pool can process before it   is recycled. A value of 0 means the application pool can process an   unlimited number of requests.p blockquote  pIt is not clear to me what happens if IIS gets two requests for the same application at almost the exact same time the one instance I clearly caught had only a 200ms delay between the two requests being sent, and Im not clear when IIS starts the new worker process  Is it as it dispatches the request to the first process, or after it has finished that request in other words, when does it increment request count beginning or end.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI do have application pool recycle due to request limit events turned on.  I went back and looked at my event for the two concurrent requests from my one very concrete example.  Heres the timesp  ul liRequest 1 121202  121243li liRequest 2 121203  121203 finished in hundreds of millisecondsli ul  pThe recycle event in Event Viewer matched the emstart timeem of emRequest 1emp  blockquote   pA worker process with process id of 10496 serving application pool   Prod  WcfWrapper has requested a recycle because it   reached its allowed request limit.p blockquote  pNow I see a very interesting word in that event text requested.  What does it mean that the application pool emrequestedem a recycle  It isnt actually yet being recycled, but will be soon  And meanwhile nearconcurrent requests will still end up being sent to the existing worker processp
Positive 215 pSo, Ive been trying to bind Wowza media server to port 80 on our failover production server, and Im encountering something else being bound to the port.p  pThe process reports as System with PID 4. After chasing myself around the web for a while, I found numerous indicators that it could be IIS, MSSQL, Microsofts Web Deployment Service, or even the Branch Cache service. After exploring all of these options, as well as a couple more that relate specifically to this server, I can say that none of these are actually binding to that IP  not intentionally anyway.p  pIf I stop my IIS Server through the IIS manager, the port frees up  generally indicating to me that it is likely IIS. After rifling through my bindings somewhere around 68 times now, I can say beyond the shadow of a doubt, that none of the sites that I have defined are bound to this IP address. It also counts to mention that there is no longer a Default Site  before that runs through anyones head.p  pFurther, Ive run netsh http show servicestate and combed through the list for any entries matching the problem IP, and have found none.p  pIve also changed the SystemCurrentControlSetHttpListenOnlyList registry entry, to no avail.p  pDoes anyone have any other suggestions for locating whatever system process  related to or reliant on IIS  could have me spinningp
Positive 215 pIve been looking into ways to speed up my website.  One of the things I came across is output caching in IIS.  Can someone tell me the difference between usermode and kernelmode caching  My webpages bring up data based on the user logged on.  When I turned both types of caching on for aspx, and I go to the website, if someone else then goes to the website, it brings up my stuff and not theirs.  If I turn off the caching, it again brings up their stuff.  Im afraid to try just one or the other without first knowing what the difference is.  I searched and I cannot find anything that helps me understand it.  Thanks in advance  I have IIS 6.1 and created my webpages using Visual Studio and vb.p
Positive 215 pI have set everything up in SQL Server to access a FileTable using UNC share. I can verify this, since I can manually access the share and manipulate the files contained in it. I have also confirmed that other applications have access to the share. p  pThe only application which doesnt seem to be able to access it under any circumstances is IIS. I have set a virtual directory up which points to the share. However, even if I use the GUI to change the virtual directorys settings, IIS complains that it cant access the share specifically, it complains about being unable to access the web.config file. If I try to access the virtual directory from a remote client, IIS returns an HTTP 500 error which I assume has to do with being unable to access the web.config file.p  pI have searched for questions relating to IIS and UNC, and they all say that you should provide read access to IISs account. However, since my share is an SQL Server FileTable, I cant exactly grant access like you would with a normal share. Also, I have verified that IISs account has access to the SQL Server instance and Database where the FileTable is its in the same database that the entire website is using without any problems.p  pId really appreciate any ideas as to how I can make this work. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 215 pI created a C console app and just want to capture the coutcerr statements in the Output Window within the Visual Studio 2005 IDE. Im sure this is just a setting that Im missing. Can anyone point me in the right directionp
Negative 215 pOK, this might sound a bit confusing and complicated, so bear with me.p  pWeve written a framework that allows us to define friendly URLs. If you surf to any arbitrary URL, IIS tries to display a 404 error or, in some cases, 40314 or 405. However, IIS is set up so that anything directed to those specific errors is sent to an .aspx file. This allows us to implement an HttpHandler to handle the request and do stuff, which involves finding the an associated template and then executing whatevers associated with it.p  pNow, this all works in IIS 5 and 6 and, to an extent, on IIS7  but for one catch, which happens when you post a form.p  pSee, when you post a form to a nonexistent URL, IIS says ah, but that url doesnt exist and throws a 405 method not allowed error. Since were telling IIS to redirect those errors to our .aspx page and therefore handling it with our HttpHandler, this normally isnt a problem. But as of IIS7, all POST information has gone missing after being redirected to the 405. And so you can no longer do the most trivial of things involving forms.p  pTo solve this weve tried using a HttpModule, which preserves POST data but appears to not have an initialized Session at the right time when its needed. We also tried using a HttpModule for all requests, not just the missing requests that hit 40440314405, but that means stuff like images, css, js etc are being handled by .NET code, which is terribly inefficient.p  pWhich brings me to the actual question has anyone ever encountered this, and does anyone have any advice or know what to do to get things working again So far someone has suggested using Microsofts own a hrefhttplearn.iis.netpage.aspx460usingurlrewritemodule relnofollowURL Rewriting modulea.

Negative 215 pHow much code documentation in your .NET source is too muchp  pSome background I inherited a large codebase that Ive talked about in some of the other questions Ive posted here on SO. One of the features of this codebase is a God Class, a single static class with 3000 lines of code encompassing several dozen static methods. Its everything from codeUtilities.CalculateFYBasedOnMonthcode to codeUtilities.GetSharePointUserInfocode to codeUtilities.IsUserIE6code. Its all good code that a hrefhttpwww.joelonsoftware.comprinterFriendlyarticlesfog0000000069.htmldoesnt need to be rewrittena, just refactored into an appropriate set of libraries. I have that planned out.p  pSince these methods are moving into a new business layer, and my role on this project is to prepare the system for maintenance by other developers, Im thinking about solid code documentation. While these methods all have good inline comments, they dont all have good or any code doco in the form of XML comments. Using a combo of GhostDoc and Sandcastle or Document X, I can create some pretty nice HTML documentation and post it to SharePoint, which would let developers understand more about what the code does without navigating through the code itself.p  pAs the amount of documentation in the code increases, the more difficult it becomes to navigate the code. Im beginning to wonder if the XML comments will make the code more difficult to maintain than, say, a simpler codecommentcode would on each method. p  pThese examples are a hrefhttpwww.innovasys.comproductsdx2008overview.aspxfrom the Document X sampleap  precode         ltsummarygt      Adds a new CustomerCustomersLibrary.Customer to the collection.      ltsummarygt      ltreturnsgtA new Customer instance that represents the new customer.ltreturnsgt      ltexamplegt          The following example demonstrates adding a new customer to the customers          collection.           ltcode langCS titleExamplegt      CustomersLibrary.Customer newCustomer  myCustomers.AddCustomersLibrary.Title.Mr, John, J, Smith          ltcodegt      ltcode langVB titleExamplegt      Dim newCustomer As CustomersLibrary.Customer  myCustomers.AddCustomersLibrary.Title.Mr, John, J, Smith          ltcodegt      ltexamplegt      ltseealso crefRemovegtRemove Methodltseealsogt      ltparam nameTitlegtThe customers title.ltparamgt      ltparam nameFirstNamegtThe customers first name.ltparamgt      ltparam nameMiddleInitialgtThe customers middle initial.ltparamgt      ltparam nameLastNamegtThe customers last name.ltparamgt     public Customer AddTitle Title, string FirstName, string MiddleInitial, string LastName           create new customer instance     Customer newCust  new CustomerTitle, FirstName, MiddleInitial, LastName       add to internal collection     mItems.AddnewCust       return ref to new customer instance     return newCust      codepre  pAndp  precode ltsummarygt  Returns the number of CustomerCustomersLibrary.Customer instances in the collection.  ltsummarygt  ltvaluegt  An Int value that specifies the number of Customer instances within the  collection.  ltvaluegt public int Count  get   return mItems.Count   codepre  pSo I was wondering from you do you document strongallstrong of your code with XML comments with the goal of using something like NDoc RIP or Sandcastle If not, how do you decide what gets documentation and what doesnt Something like an API would obviously have doco, but what about a codebase that youre going to hand off to another team to maintainp  pWhat do you think I should dop

Negative 215 pI am writing a Bytecode instrumenter. Right now, I am trying to find out how to do that in the presence of objects. I would like some clarifications on two lines I read in the JVMS section 4.9.4p  blockquote   p1 The verifier rejects code that uses the new object before it has been   initialized.p blockquote  pMy question is, what does uses mean here Im guessing that it means passing it as a method attribute, calling codeGETFIELDcode and codePUTFIELDcode on it, or calling any instance method on it. Are their other forbidden uses And I believe that it follows that other instructions such as codeDUPcode, codeLOADcode and codeSTOREcode are allowed.p  blockquote   p2 Before that method invokes another instance initialization method of   myClass or its direct superclass on   this, the only operation the method   can perform on this is assigning   fields declared within myClass.p blockquote  pWhich means that in an codeltinitgtcode method, GETFIELD and PUTFIELD are allowed before another codeltinitgtcode is called. However, in Java, doing any operation on an instance field before a call to codesupercode or codethiscode results in a compilation error. Could someone clarify thisp  p3 I have one more question. When does an object reference becomes initialized, and hence, ready to be freely used From reading the JVMS, I came up with the answer that whether an object is initialized or not, is up to each method. At a certain point in time, the object can be initialized for a method but not for the other. Specifically, an object becomes initialized for a method when codeltinitgtcode called by that method returns.p  pFor example, consider that the codemaincode method created an object and called codeltinitgtcode which then called the superclasss codeltinitgtcode. After returning from codesupercode, the object is now considered initialized by codeltinitgtcode , but is not yet initialized for codemaincode. Does this mean, in codeltinitgtcode after codesupercode, I can pass the object as a parameter to a method, even before returning from to main.p  pCould someone confirm that this whole analysis is true Thank you for your time. p  pps I have actually posted the same question to the Sun forums but with on response. I hope Ill have more luck here. Thank you.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pFirst thank you for your answers and time. Although I didnt get a clearcut answer I had many questions and some of them were a bit vague, your answers and examples, and the subsequent experiments, were extremely useful for me in understanding more deeply how the JVM works.p  pThe main thing I discovered is that the Verifiers behavior differ with different implementations and versions which makes the job of bytecode manipulation much more complicated. The problem lies in either a nonconformity to the JVMS, or a lack of documentation from the verifiers developers, or the JVMS has some subtle vagueness in the verifiers area.p  pOne last thing, SO Rocks I posted the same question in the official Sun JVM Specifications forum, and I still got no answer till now.p

Negative 215 pAt our company we have a very nice system setup for tracking our external packages dependencies in revision control for our current desktop application development Cpython.  We are starting to develop some python only web applications are are looking for recommendations for best practices when there is only python code involved and it comes from easyinstallable packages.p  pFor our desktop apps we have something like thisp  precodeappsvnroot    trunk      src      doc      deps gt [svnexternal to deps repos with rev num set]  depssvnroot    trunk      setupenv.shbat  [generated automatically      depproject1 [example boost, libxml, python, etc]         vendorbase [svnexternal to vendor branch or project repository]         installlinuxgcc43           bin           include           lib         installlinuxwin32vc90           ...   [whatever directory structure the project build creates] codepre  pWhen any developer on the team checks out the code for the application, they automatically get all the dependencies and get them with the correct version for that revision of the code. [note there are several internal management scripts, etc that I left out, but this is the general idea].  This works great for us.  No developer needs to worry any more about setting up their personal machine with every package with the correct version, it allow multiple development copies to be checked out at a time ex version 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, etc, and it allows the continuous integration system to package the dependencies and run unit tests with the correct version of the deps.p  pNow we are starting to work on some google app engine based python projects and we want something like the above.  We want to keep the ability to have a developer check out everything they need at once and guarantee that everyone is using the same dependencies.  We could keep using this exact structure, but it seems to heavy weight for a pure python project.p  pOriginally I was thinking of something like thisp  precode trunk    gaeapps      gaesdk  [svnexternal to the latest stable GAE code]      deps        nose        nosegae        pylint      app1        templates        tests        deps          webapp2          console codepre  pThe problem I am running into is that all the python projects I want to use nose, nosegae, etc recommend using codeeasyinstallcode to download and install them.  This installs them into the main system directory though.  What I really want is to have the code installed into a specific directory for each package.  note I was planning to put some code in main.py that would add all the packages in deps to sys.path correctly.

I want some of those properties e.g. Degree, City, Institute to be dropboxes with values taken from database. For this purpose i can create a custom TypeConvertor like this onep  precodeclass DegreeTypeConverter  StringConverter    static string[] valueList   Bachelor, Master, Student      public override bool GetStandardValuesSupported      ITypeDescriptorContext context         return true       public override bool GetStandardValuesExclusive      ITypeDescriptorContext context         return true        public override StandardValuesCollection GetStandardValues      ITypeDescriptorContext context         return new StandardValuesCollectionvalueList      [TypeConvertertypeofDegreeTypeConverter]   public string Degree         get  return degree       set  degree  value     codepre  pBut i want to get that valueList from database and i have 14 such properties so some universal converter would be much better than 14 converters with the only difference valueList. Is it possible to create a TypeConverter with variable valueList for example passed into TypeConverter as parameter in constructor Or maybe theres another way to have in PropertyGrid a dropbox with variable value list Hope it was clear enough Thnx in advancep

Negative 215 pI am developing an ASP.NET Application and am trying to use the 64bit driver version of ODBC on my 64 bit win 7 machine, because the deployment server has Windows Server 2008, which is naturally in 64 bit, since Microsoft decided not to make a 32 bit version afaik.p  pThe first issue was an codeSystem.Data.Odbc.OdbcExceptioncode strongERROR [IM014] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] The specified DSN contains an architecture mismatch between the Driver and Applicationstrong. Despite the fact, that I am developing on a 64 bit operation system, the compiler seems to have decided to compile for 32 bit. After some research I changed the target platform to x64 in every of my own assemblies. I am using NHibernate and Spring.Net, but I read somewhere that 64 bit is no problem for NHibernate. I did not check Spring.Net yet. The compilation began.p  pI got some warnings that quite every .net assembly is built for another platform, but I read somewhere again that I can ignore these warning and the application should run just fine because the runtime or compiler will figure out the right assembly.p  pSo I tested the application right away and was rewarded with an codeSystem.BadImageFormatExceptioncode wrong format. It was again an exception concerning 3264 bit issues although every one of my assemblies is compiled as 64 bit.p  pI am slowly starting to hate 64 bit. Seriously. Is it that difficult to build an 64 bit application on an 64 bit operation system for a 64 bit server with 64 bit driversp  pDoes anybody have a solution or have experience with this issue I found many workarounds with using 32 bit, but that is not an option here. It has to be a 64 bit solution.p  pNevertheless I will continue trying for myself to solve this. I will write any progress here.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Spring.Net seems to be just fine on 64 bit since the assembly is dynamically compiled at runtime to the native machine architecture.p

Negative 215 pIm stuck on this one. I hope someone here has some experience with this. Here is the situation. I have set up a web page that allows users to upload flat files to be loaded into SQL Server 2005 using SSIS. There are two difference SSIS processes depending on the file type. The decision of which SSIS process to use is made by the user on the website.p  pOnce the file is uploaded by the user the process is started by a .NET Process object. The command line is the normal command line youd expect to see to start dtexec with a specific SSIS file and that sets a couple variables. For examplep  pdtexec f  De  set  valuep  pThe ASP.NET Anonymous User is running as a domain user account. All SSIS package files for both SSIS processes are in the same directory. The domain user account has full privileges on that directory. The same method in ASP.NET starts either of the processes. The only difference is the WebMethod called by the website. One WebMethod for each type. It is in these WebMethods where the unique arguments are assigned to the command line text for SSIS.p  pHere is where I have run into the problem. When running the website process 1, it runs fine, but process 2 fails with the error mentioned above.

Negative 215 pI am building a JavaScript SDK for our API. The API currently requires 2legged OAuth authentication. Obviously this isnt suitable for a JS SDK since the key and secret are in plain site in the JS code. p  pFacebook only requires your app id when you init their JS SDK, so I would like to implement something similar or of similar simplicity. When a developer requests a key we require their apps domain. I was thinking of detecting the IP address of the submitted domain for example myclientapp.com has 192.168.0.0 IP. And then authenticating JavaScript requests by confirming the remote hosts IP address matches.p  pIs this the besteasiest way of doing thisp  pUPDATE As a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers243245rupRupa pointed out the remote IP will be the client and thus not match the apps URLs IP.

Negative 215 pI have a occasionally connected application where there is a server that stores information about products.  I am using a database cache to store this information locally so when a connection is unavailable the application will still work when trying to read the database.p  pSince the database is configured and I do not have access to modify the tables, I did not implement 2 way updating and it only downloads a snapshot.  A side question is if it is possible to create a database cache and have 2way sync with only tracking columns on the client machine  I cannot add any columns or tables to the server.  I know this might be a question for a separate post, but if this is true then it would change my direction for this problem completely, to a separate module detecting and syncing the database and handling any sync errors that are thrown and always connecting to the cache.p  pI am using a generic repository and I am wondering what the best practice to go about handling if a connection is available or not and using either a local or remote database depending on this status.p  pShould I add an interface to the generic repository that handles returning the correct string, and lets the repository know if it is live or not  I need to enabledisable certain features depending on the connection state so I also will need a property somewhere so that when this repository is used there can be a way to bind various controls enabled state to this status.p  pInstead should I have a wrapper that contains for example an IRepository and IConnectionStringManager and then handles feeding and initializing the repository connection string based on availability  This wrapper would expose the repository and any status properties required.p  pI guess I am not sure if I should be setting up my program to use IRepository with all the automatic connection sensing behind the scenes, or if I should have IRepositoryManager that has a IRepository and IConnectionStringManager in it.p  pMaybe both of those options are wrongp

Negative 215 pWe have a database called AVL in SQL Server 2008 R2 SE. This database has many tables, but there is one in particular called ASSETLOCATION that has 46 millon rows right now and accounts for 99.9 of the total database size.p  pThis table has information from 2008 to date, and the actual rate of growing is about 120k records daily. Now, there are 2 situations we like to addressp  ul liPerformance is starting to degrade slowly, and everything is optimized so theres not much to doli liBackup times are increasing and is becoming a problem we do 1 full backup everyday. The BAK file is 11GB, after winrar does his thing the final size 2GB and then a script sends the file offsite. We have a T1 and pulling 2GB through the wire is taking about 5 hours.li ul  pAll this is normal but heres the catch I want to capitalize on 90 of SQL statements use information only 3 months old or less, in other words, data from 2008, 2009 and 2010 dont get accessed often.p  pI was thinking on creating one new database for each year. Lets say   AVL2008 database, only table there will be ASSETLOCATION with records from 2008   AVL2009 database, only table there will be ASSETLOCATION with records from 2009   AVL2010 database, only table there will be ASSETLOCATION with records from 2010p  pAs you have already guessed data from the past dont get changed, so this will be great from the backup perspective since the AVL database will only have the records from the current year. This approach will also help performance a lot.p  pNow for the problem. Assume the ASSETLOCATION table has the following columns   IDASSETLOCATION int, PK identity   IDASSET int, FK to ASSET table   WHEN datetime   LATLONG varchar22, spatial infop  pI need to create a view in the AVL database called vASSETLOCATION, witch is quite simple, strongbut I dont want the view accessing all the databases and joining the ASSETLOCATION tables via UNIONstrong, rather the only ones needed based on the WHEN field. For examplep  precodeselect  from vASSETLOCATION where [WHEN] between 20080101 and 20080102 codepre  pIn this case the view should ONLY ACCESS the AVL2008.ASSETLOCATION tablep  precodeselect  from vASSETLOCATION where [WHEN] between 20081229 and 20090105 codepre  pIn this case the view should access AVL2008.ASSETLOCATION and AVL2009.ASSETLOCATIONp  precodeselect  from vASSETLOCATION where      [WHEN] between 20080101 and 20080101 or      [WHEN]  getdate codepre  pIn this case the view should access AVL2008.ASSETLOCATION and strongAVL.ASSETLOCATIONstrongp  pI know a table scalar UDF in place of the view will solve the problem, but there are more than only 4 fields and [WHEN] is not the only field we may want to include in the where part.  Before anyone suggest it, the table partitioning feature will perhaps help in performance, but NOT in the backup problem.p  pIf there a way to do this in a view Thanks.p

Negative 215 pALL, I need to send an SMS from the Android phone. I found the following a hrefhttpmobiforge.comdevelopingstorysmsmessagingandroid relnofollowlinka and use the code after p  blockquote   pIf you need to monitor the status of the SMS message sending process, you can actually use two PendingIntent objects together with two BroadcastReceiver objects, like thisp blockquote  pDuring testing I found out that the message is sent successfully, but I never got notification about message received. My SMS is sent to a regular phone not an Android one and not even a smartphone. Is this a problem Is back notification doesnt work with regular phonep  pNow the problem with that is that since there is no notification the program just hangs in the delivered broadcast receiver  it waits for a confirmation or cancellation of the message. Is there any way to set a time limit on the wait period The nonresponsive dialog also doesnt show up there.p  pI also found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3875354androidsmsmessagedeliveryreportintentthisa but there is only one message reply. Or maybe it just an HTC thingp  pAny ideap  pThank you.p

Negative 215 pstrongUpdate Filestrongp  pstrikeUpon request, I am including the link to the file a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu16709081Progress20Sheet202.xlsx relnofollowherea.strike emFile no longer availableemp  pI have transformed my original data into a gamelike context, in which the sheet keeps track of points for completed activities and upon reaching various point amounts, the user goes up in rank. An easy way to see the issue is to enter a 1 and then 2 and 3 into F15 next to the cell with 500. When you do so, notice how the values in Q5Q6 change from 0 to 1, but Ranking in C2 which is the SUM function which counts this range does not increase to 3 like it should. And consequently the values in L12 and L14 which are based on it also dont update. Now, if you recalculate, the rank goes up and the L cells update. NOW, cell E3 which is based on the L cells doesnt reflect the correct value, and you have to once again recalculate the sheet for it to update.p  pHope all that makes sense  let me know if you need any clarificationp  pstrongOriginal Questionstrongp  pSome of my formulas are not updating right away after I have entered in data. Just to get this out of the way before someone suggests it, I DO have the calculation of the workbook set to automatic, and I DONT open any other workbooks with their calculation method set to manual. So thats not the issue.p  pI would give specifics on formulas, but I dont think it has anything to do with that. The formula is a simple SUM function which adds together a range. The range updates properly  as soon as Ive entered data, the numbers in the range change accordingly. The SUM function should likewise automatically update, but I have to enter data in another cell or press delete in an empty cell basically, get the sheet to recalculate once again to get the SUM function to reflect the changes in the range.p  pThe only thing that I can think is that its because Ive enabled iterative calculation in File  Options  Formulas tab  in order to allow cells to retain their previous value if a certain condition is true, else update their value. My settings are 1 for Maximum Iterations and the default of 0.001 for Maximum Change. However, Ive used that before without having issues with a simple SUM function. And I have other just as simple functions in my sheet that DO update properly, so Im a little confused...p  pLet me know if any more info would be helpful. Thanks for any suggestionsp

Negative 215 pI have an app that allows a user to drag views onto the screen in multiple orientations. So lets say im in portrait mode and my superview is 768x1024.  Lets say I drag 10 different items onto that superview.  These items are scaled, rotated, etc.  Then I rotate the device and my superview shrinks down to 576x768.  How do I get all of my subviews to maintain their position and transform relative to the new smaller size So in essence my superview and all of its subviews should look exactly as they did while in portrait, except everything has been scaled down.p  pAnd also, what if im in landscape and everything is shrunk down and then I drag another view on and shrink it down to fit well.  I would need that new view to scale up in proper place and size when the device is rotated back into portraitp

Negative 215 pI think JQuery is great but I also like the idea of keeping the HTML in the HTML document and virtually none of it in the javascript.  What do I mean  You know like, say you are creating a dynamic table that had many many rows or a variable number of rows.  This is exactly what I DONT want to dop  precodefunction initBoardsymbol      for var i0ilt30i          myBoard  lttrgt         enemyBoard  lttrgt         for var j0jlt60j              myBoard  lttd bgcolor0000ff idmysqrijgtsymbollttdgt             enemyBoard  lttd bgcolorff0000 idenemysqrijgtsymbollttdgt                  myBoard  lttrgt         enemyBoard  lttrgt          myboard.htmlmyBoard     enemyboard.htmlenemyBoard   codepre  pA few years ago I came up with a solution that almost works well and I frequently use it but Id still like to see something better and thats what my question is about.  My current strategy is to create a hidden div at the bottom of the main HTML file.  For examplep  precodeltdiv classhiddentemplates stylevisibilityhiddengt     ltdiv idboardlinetplgt         lttd bgcolorbgcolor idsidesqrindex1index2gtsymbollttdgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pand then the javascript is changed to something like thisp  precodefunction initBoardsymbol      for var i0ilt30i          myBoard  lttrgt         enemyBoard  lttrgt         for var j0jlt60j                       Get the template             myBoardLine  boardlinetpl.html                      substitue the templatesvariables with unique data                     myBoardLine.replaceside, my                     myBoardLine.replacebgcolor, 0000ff                     myBoardLine.replaceindex1, i                     myBoardLine.replaceindex2, j                     myBoardLine.replacesymbol, symbol                     myBoard  myBoardLine                      You get the idea.

A good candidate for a template is HTML having 5 or more lines. Another thing in its favor is it does do the job of getting HTML out of the Javascript.  Now I can let my HTML designer edit the HTML in the hiddentemplate div, and change the look of it and put classes in as desired It was easy to teach him about the templates and what they do and so now he doesnt have to touch the Javascript.  However, lately Ive been running into some problems with defining whole tables as a template.  As JQuery reads the template it tries to reinterpret the table code and it screws it up.p

Negative 215 pSo, I have a fairly typical app with codeUITableViewControllercodes inside of an codeUINavigationControllercode, the cells of the table views are fairly large since they display a title and three lines of preview text, similar to an RSS reader, so I decided against an codeUITabBarcode which would eat another huge amount of the screen space making it impossible to see more than four cells. However, I have two other screens I want to display, emfavoritesem and emsettingsem, together with one main landing page, so I need a way to navigate between those three.p  pMy problem is what UI control can I use instead of an codeUITabBarcode I thought about an codeUIToolBarcode but that feels totally wrong, a swipeable codeUINavigationBarcode seems to be quite okay from a UX perspective, but I guess not many users will get that. I also thought about embedding everything in an paged and horizontal codeUIScrollViewcode, but that doesnt work with the swipe to delete table view feature.p  pAny ideas about a cool and intuitive controlp

Negative 215 pI have a number of classes which are wrapped by other classes to add new functionality.p  pUnfortunately, the wrapper classes dont implement pass through functions for the classes they are wrapping, so the wrapper cannot be used interchangeably with the original class.p  pI would like to dynamically create classes that contain the functionality of both the wrapper and the original class.p  pThe idea I had was to create a mixin class and use a factory to apply it to the existing class to create a new dual use class dynamically.

Negative 215 pI have two MySQL tables, with the following structure I have removed irrelevant columns.p  precodemysqlgt DESCRIBE edinnersdetails   Field             Type              Null  Key  Default  Extra             detailsid        int11 unsigned  NO    PRI  NULL     autoincrement   detailspupilid  int11 unsigned  NO         NULL                      detailscost      double unsigned   NO         NULL                       mysqlgt DESCRIBE edinnerspayments   Field             Type              Null  Key  Default  Extra             paymentid        int11 unsigned  NO    PRI  NULL     autoincrement   paymentpupilid  int11 unsigned  NO         NULL                      paymentamount    float unsigned    NO         NULL                      codepre  pThe way the system works is that you order a meal and each meal has a cost, each of these orders are stored in codeedinnersdetailscode. An example row would be as followsp  precodemysqlgt SELECT  FROM edinnersdetails LIMIT 1   detailsid  detailspupilid  detailscost             1             18343            25   codepre  pTypically people will pay for these meals in bulk  if they have 40 worth of meals over the course of 20 days, theyll pay that off at the end of the month. Every time they pay, a new row goes into the codeedinnerspaymentscode table, an example row for this would be as followsp  precodemysqlgt SELECT  FROM edinnerspayments LIMIT 1   paymentid  paymentpupilid  paymentamount             1             18343              20   codepre  pSo from these two rows we can see that this person is current 5 in debt  theyve had a 25 meal and only paid 20. Over time there will be many rows for each of the users of the system, I can easily work out how much worth of food theyve had by doing a simple query such as p  precodeSELECT SUMdetailscost AS mealtotal  FROM edinnersdetails  WHERE detailspupilid  18343 codepre  pThen to get the amount of money they have paid, I simply do this queryp  precodeSELECT SUMpaymentamount AS paymenttotal  FROM edinnerspayments  WHERE paymentpupilid  18343 codepre  pMy ultimate goal is to be able to see who owes the most money, but to loop every user of my codeuserscode table and run these two queries for them, I believe it would be quite slow, so ideally what I would like to do is combine the two above queries into one, and perhaps an additional column which would be codemealtotalcode  codepaymenttotalcode which would give me the amount owed. Ive tried a few methods to make this work, including joins and subqueries but they all seem to repeat every relevant line from the codeedinnersdetailscode for each of the codeedinnerspaymentscode line  so if there were 3 details and 4 payments, you would have 12 rows pulled out which means doing a SUM on the columns gives me a value which far exceeds what it should be. A good way to demonstrate this would be to run this queryp  precodeSELECT  FROM      SELECT detailscost AS cost      FROM edinnersdetails      WHERE detailspupilid  18343     GROUP BY detailsid  AS details,      SELECT paymentamount AS amount      FROM edinnerspayments      WHERE paymentpupilid  18343     GROUP BY paymentid  AS payment codepre  pwhich gives me the following resultp  precode  cost  amount     2.5      20    2.5       6    2.5       3    2.5    1200    2.5      20    2.5       6    2.5       3    2.5    1200    2.5      20    2.5       6    2.5       3    2.5    1200    2.5      20    2.5       6    2.5       3    2.5    1200    2.5      20    2.5       6    2.5       3    2.5    1200   codepre  pAdding the SUM into this, as suchp  precodeSELECT SUMdetails.cost AS detailscost, SUMpayment.amount AS paymenttotal FROM      SELECT detailscost AS cost      FROM edinnersdetails      WHERE detailspupilid  18343     GROUP BY detailsid  AS details,      SELECT paymentamount AS amount      FROM edinnerspayments      WHERE paymentpupilid  18343     GROUP BY paymentid  AS payment codepre  pGives me the following resultp  precode  detailscost  paymenttotal              50           6145   codepre  pIf this was working, codedetailscostcode would be 12.5 and codepaymenttotalcode would be 1229, but that is not the case. You can clearly see the repetition in the above result, I apologise that all the costs are 2.5, it makes it a little less obvious, but they are 5 seperate meal orders with 4 payments having been made.  Does anyone know how I would go about getting the SUM of the meal order costs and the SUM of the payments at the same timep  pThanksp

What Im not sure about it is that I have a dynamic address provided by my ISP, so on a certain time my IP will change, that will force me to also change the .htaccess to my new address, I dont see that practical. I can set a range also, but by doing that I will also authorize access to all people within that range of IPs other clients of my ISP for example. p  pIm then struggling to find the beststandard way to do this. p  pAnyone can help mep  pThanksp

Negative 215 pI have a virtual file system, which is inherently slow because it uses web service as a backend Google Docs API. p  pIt works totally fine with one caveat GTK applications use GtkFileChooser, which tries to determine content type for the file to display icon or something. When it encounters a file, which it can not recognize by extension, it reads initial chunk of data to try to use that to determine file type. In my case this causes the entire file to be downloaded from the network, which extremely slows down directory listing in file dialogs.p  pIt turns out that Gio backend for GtkFileChooser supports 2 modes for content type discovery regular with attribute standardcontenttype and fast standardfastcontenttype, which only looks at the file extension. However, it seems that GtkFileChooser queries only for standardcontenttype.p  pDoes GTK really always try to use slow algorithm for content type discovery Even for known to be slow filesystems like NFSp  pIs there any way to mount my file system such that it would only use fast content type discoveryp

Negative 215 pI am trying to wire up an AsyncController so that when a user clicks save on an order on the order page, all users viewing the same order should get a notification that the order has changed. My approach to implement this is to do long polling ajax requests on the order page, however how to make a scalable AsyncController to deal with this is not obvious to me.p  pSo this is what I have so far, the ID is the ID of the order that is signaled as changed or polled for changes.p  precodepublic class MessageController  AsyncController      static readonly ConcurrentDictionaryltint, AutoResetEventgt Events  new ConcurrentDictionaryltint, AutoResetEventgt      public ActionResult Signalint id              AutoResetEvent event         if Events.TryGetValueid, out event             event.Set          return ContentSignal           public void WaitAsyncint id              Events.TryAddid, new AutoResetEventfalse           TODO This works, but I should probably not block this thread.

Negative 215 pYes, I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4394930simdcoderunsslowerthanscalarcodeSIMD code runs slower than scalar codea.  No, its not really a duplicate.p  pI have been using 2D math stuff for a while, and in the process of porting my codebase from C to C.  There are a few walls Ive hit with C that mean I really need polymorphism, but thats another story.  Anyway, I considered this a while ago, but it presented a perfect opportunity to use a 2D vector class, including SSE implementations of the common math operations.  Yes, I know there are libraries out there, but I wanted to try it myself to understand whats going on, and I dont use anything more complicated than codecode.p  pMy implementation is via codeltimmintrin.hgtcode, with ap  precodeunion      m128d ss     struct          double x         double y       codepre  pSSE seemed slow, so I looked at its generated ASM output.  After fixing something stupid pointerwise, I ended up with the following sets of instructions, run a billion times in a loop Processor is an AMD Phenom II at 3.7GHzp  pSSE enabled 1.1 to 1.8 seconds variesp  precodeadd      0x1, eax addpd    xmm0, xmm1 cmp      0x3b9aca00, eax jne      4006c8 codepre  pSSE disabled 1.0 seconds pretty constantp  precodeadd      0x1, eax addsd    xmm0, xmm3 cmp      0x3b9aca00, eax addsd    xmm2, xmm1 jne      400630 codepre  pThe only conclusion I can draw from this is that codeaddsdcode is faster than codeaddpdcode, and that pipelining means that the extra instruction is compensated for by the ability to do more faster things partially overlapping.p  pSo my question is is this worth it, and in practice will it actually help, or should I just not bother with the stupid optimization and let the compiler handle it in scalar modep

But according to this quote from Douglas Crockford the prototype mechanism helps you conserve memoryp  blockquote   pWhen a member is sought and it isnt found in the object itself, then   it is taken from the objects constructors prototype member. The   prototype mechanism is used for inheritance. It also conserves memory.p blockquote  pWhen only memory is saved then I guess this might not be such a big deal because memory is getting cheaper by the second. But according to a hrefhttpejohn.orgblogsimpleclassinstantiation relnofollowthis article from John Resiga it is also fasterCPU to add a lot of properties the prototype chain.p  blockquote   pThus, if you have a frequentlyaccessed function returning an object   that you want people to interact with, then its to your advantage to   have the object properties be in the prototype chain and instantiate   it.p      pInstantiating a function with a bunch of prototype properties is very,   very, fast. It completely blows the Module pattern, and similar, out   of the water.

There has to be a builtin function somewhere or in some codeimportcodeable module that provides the functionality of codegetitemcode which, the only reason I dont want to use, is that its not really pythonic to use mangled methods.p  pI know about codeoperator.getitemcode which lets me predefine an index codeicode and get the element at codeicode in any input sequence.

The action result contains the view model from which I can extract some important information.p  pBased on the extensibility of MVC, I thought this would be easy.  I thought I could mock up a HttpRequest using the string URL and pass it through the routing and controller.  My end point would be invoking the action method which would return the ActionResult.

Negative 215 pWhen javascript creates the parent div that all of my output is contained in, I am hiding it with codeelement.style.display  nonecode. For performance purposes, I think having my plugin javascript load the css file at the beginning is the fastest way. Then the css will make the parent div visible again once it loads. However, if the css file loads before the div is created, wouldnt javascript still hide it when it gets to that point in the code Using an important tag here would seem cheap. Alternatively, loading the css file after creating the div would just mean the output would take longer to be displayed to the user. Im wondering if there is a standard solution to this, but havent been able to find one. Thanksp

Bear with me. p  pI find changing the system language in Mac OS X a useful way to augment my learning of natural languages, eg French. However sometimes I find a menu item or dialog box in French that I cant understand and its a bore to google the translation or change the system language back to English. But I know that the English translation is hidden away somewhere in the localisation file and maps somehow to the French phrase. So what I want to do is extract all the text from all the localisation files to develop a mapping of this phrase in English  that phrase in French so I can look it up easily. p  pI know that the localisation files are stored in something like Localizable.strings, lproj files and nib files but I cant make head or tail of how they are stored or how to work with them. I can program but Ive never written anything in Xcode. All the information I can find is for Mac OS  iOS programmers to localise their software, not for hackers to extract already made localisation information. p  pHow can I extract the foreign language information as plain text from Mac OS X system and 3rd party software localisation files Thanksp

Negative 215 pI built a C library for making games in most known platforms and it works alright. However, I ran into a minor problem with the linker, which I cant live with myself without figuring the answer.p  pI have two separate classes in two separate files codeKinesisWorldcode in codeKinesisWorld.hcode and codeASEnginecode in codeASEngine.hcode . Both of them have a similar behavior in terms of implementation, they encapsulate functionality provided by other libraries, codeKinesisWorldcode inherits and calls codeBox2Dcode functions and codeASEnginecode calls codeangelscriptcode functions. So far so good.p  pNow, when I am building an application that uses my library, as long as I dont include or use codeKinesisWorldcode, the linker wont attempt to link the codeBox2Dcode library. As soon as I simply include codeKinesisWorld.hcode somewhere in the final executable source, it immediately complains of undefined references until I add codeBox2Dcode to the linker. This is the behavior I always known and observed with other libraries as well.p  pThough, with codeangelscriptcode, without including codeASEngine.hcode at all, it will always complain about undefined references to codeangelscriptcode, even if the final executable doesnt make any reference to it whatsoever.p  pAny idea of what can cause such thing I tested it on Linux 32 bit and Windows 32 bit, with GCC and Visual Studio respectively, same behavior.p

Negative 215 pI noticed a big difference in performance of my C program depending on the fPIC flag. When I use it my program is about 30 slower than without it.  I am comparing it with a Lua program which calls a C function where all the heavy calculation is done. Firstly I created a shared object with the C function, so had to use the fPIC flag. The performance is very similar to the C code with fPIC flag.  So now I tried to the same without the .so I called Lua from Cp  precodeint main      luaState L  luaLnewstate     luaLopenlibsL     luaregisterL, mycfunction, mycfunction     luaLdofileL, myluaprogram.lua     luacloseL     return 0  codepre  pBut here performance is the same regardless if I use the fPIC flag or not and the same as the approach with .so. I was expecting some improvement without the fPIC flag... Any advice on how can I investigate it further Is the second approach creating position independent code anyway and thats why the performance is similar Thanks p  pMore information, as suggested by the comment I use the O3 flag, gcc 4.7.2, Ubuntu 12.04.2, x8664. Yes, I was quite surprised with so big overhead... My program is calculating Mandelbrot fractal. So there are two loops iterating over x and y and the function I have in C is isMandelbrot it takes the number of iterations and returns bool belongs to Mandelbrot set or not. I use the shared object with require.p

On one hand, the first definition seems to be the correct one according to database design theory, simply because there is no extra junk in it and the PRIMARY KEY constraint guarantees that there cannot be two rows with the same value, that is, there is no way that, for instance, the word English can appear twice in the column, which is, of course, a good thing. But the problem with this is that the foreign key field in another table that references the language column has to store strings instead of ID numbers. That simply means the referencing table will be storing the whole thing in the column and if the application can provide a dropdown combobox list with prepopulated unique values in it, having the languages table seems to have no point. But, theoretically speaking, the first way is still more correct.p  pOn the other hand, the second approach sounds more practical. For ensuring uniqueness we can use the UNIQUE constraint and we have integers instead of strings in the referencing columns which tend to take up less memory and, as far as I know, they are much faster during searching operations than strings.p  pPlease, help me get this straight.p

Negative 215 pIve been tasked with providing the backend for a news feed that will be used by our company apps.

Our current site is not responsive, and was not originally designed to handle mobile devices. We would like to open a small, clean page showing ONLY the code[content]code of that particular article. Im looking for a way to link to a page showing only this content  no header, no footer, nothing. p  pI know that I could create a new page to handle all of this, but it needs to be dynamic. New articles are created regularly, and Id like to avoid having to add emanotherem page to handle this for every article, while also making it simple for the writing team to integrate this feature.p  pOne of my ideas so far isp  ul liPass a GET parameter to the URL link in the JSON  something like  codewww.mysite.comarticle1contentOnlytruecode. Then, in my article, detect this parameter in PHP and handle accordingly. I would need this snippet on each article written, so it may cause issues down the road if our staff writers forget to add it.li ul  pI havent worked with ModX long, so Im assuming theres a better way to handle this. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if I need to provide more information.p

Negative 215 pIm writing a program that generates thumbnails for every page in a large document.  For performance reasons I would like to keep the thumbnails in memory for as long as possible, but I would like the OS to be able to reclaim that memory if it decides there is another more important use for it e.g. the user has started running a different application.p  pI can always regenerate the thumbnail later if the memory has gone away.p  pIs there any crossplatform method for flagging memory as canberemovedifneeded  The program is written in C.p  hr  pEDIT Just to clarify, rather than being notified when memory is low or regularly monitoring the systems amount of memory, Im thinking more along the lines of allocating memory and then unlocking it when its not in use.  The OS can then steal unlocked memory if needed even for disk buffers if it thinks that would be a better use of the memory and all I have to do as a programmer is just lock the memory again before I intend to use it.  If the lock fails I know the memory has been reused for something else so I need to regenerate the thumbnail again, and if the lock succeeds I can just keep using the data from before.p  pThe reason is I might be displaying maybe 20 pages of a document on the screen, but I may as well keep thumbnails of the other 200 or so pages in case the user scrolls around a bit.  But if they go do something else for a while, that memory might be better used as a disk cache or for storing web pages or something, so Id like to be able to tell the OS that it can reuse some of my memory if it wants to.p  pHaving to monitor the amount of free systemwide memory may not achieve the goal my memory will never be reclaimed to improve disk caching, and getting lowmemory notifications will only help in emergencies.  I was hoping that by having a lockunlock method, this could be achieved in more of a lightweight way and benefit the performance of the system in a nonemergency situation.p

Previously I had accomplished this by doing something likep  precodefor small in smalllist     for line in biglist         if small.upper in line.upper             finallines.appendline codepre  pIm fairly certain that this decreases speed by a lot. If anyone knows of a way to do that more efficiently, that would be helpful as well.p
Negative 215 pThis is probably really simple, but I cant get my head around it.  I have a UIViewController with two UITableView subviews placed on it using Storyboards.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4FDcO.png altenter image description herep  pThese both have custom classes and are used for two separate lists of items.  The custom classes are used because the cells in each UITableView can be dragged and dropped between the tables.  The view controller is segued to and has a Managed Object Context pushed with the segue.  p  pWhat I cant figure out is how to pass the managed object context and other objects to the UITableView subviews.  The objects are defined in the table view class.  p  pIve set IBOutlets to each of the table views, so can reference the UITableViews themselves, but I have no visibility of the custom objects. p  pHow can I pass objects to a custom class subviewp

Negative 215 pIm absolutely new to iOS development so any advice would be valuable.p  pThe question itself I need to create an application similar to presentation for sales people. Because 3D window is required existing applications like Keynote cannot be used if you know something that allows loading 3D models  that would be also great.p  pOf course making it 100 hardcoded is bad idea, because the content of presentation may change. The idea is to use some kind of MsrkUp language that will allow you to load slides and add content using some configmarkup files. By content I mean pictures, text, movies, etc. 3D should be handledp  pAs an example, there is a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.frame.aspx relnofollowFrame controla in .NET WPF that allows you dynamic loading of HTML, XAML, PDF  we used it to create XAMLbased help for the application.p  pIs there anything like that for iOSp  pThere is also an idea to provide a predefined set of layouts with possibility to configure content, however that decreases flexibility a lot.p

So I really want to your help.p  pIll explain my problem. I want to compile some sample source code. The name is emVrayMaya pluginem, actually its related with computer graphics programming. They already provided Visual Studio projects, so I just want to compile with this. The project finally generates some .dll file, actually it called emVray pluginem. p  pThats my job. But I met this horrible link error.p  pAs you can see, I think strongplugmans.libstrong generates some problem. And I think this problem related with STLbecause I could find stdbasestring in my error message. Maybe strongplugmans.libstrong uses some kinds of STL library, and when I made some dll library it makes some problem, but Im not sure.p  pstrongplugmans.libstrong is published the company who provide emVrayem, so I couldnt see source code of the library. Its not open. I also changed my VS project runtime library setting to strongmultithread debug dllMDdstrong but it wasnt helpful.  p  pI cant upload my source code because its too big, but the source code was provided by company so I think there is no problem. p  pHere is the link about the Vray SDK development page. But, their explanation of compilation is not very detailed. So I couldnt solve the problem.p  pCould you give me some hint for solving this problem And if you solve this problem, it will be really, really helpful for me. p  pMy environment is WIN7, 64bit, VS2010. p  pADDp  pIll attach the VS project, and VrayMaya lib, include files.p  pa hrefhttpvml.kaist.ac.krdownloadVrayVSProj.7z relnofollowVray VS Project6.64KBa a hrefhttpvml.kaist.ac.krdownloadVrayMayaResources.7z relnofollowVrayMaya LibampInclude Files13.7MBap  pActually I dont have idea which part of source code will be helpful to solve the problem.p  pSo I just upload the project file. And also I upload the VrayMaya includelib files. I think those files are enough to compile the project. If you can do that, it will be really nice daylight for me. p

Negative 215 pIm attempting to determine a suitable way to accomplish the following.p  pI would like to have range  set lookup within a particular range say [0x0  0xffffffff]. Values are inserted into the range at ranges so if we are working with T  unique strings, I might insertbeef3490, [0x1234,  0xFFFF] and a single id may have multiple inserts, which may or may not overlap.

Negative 215 blockquote   pI want to add two items at a time to a list comprehension. One item is constant. How can this be achieved using only one for loop inside of a list comprehension, and no additional functions. Answers that do not use any import will be favored.p blockquote  pTake a look at at the followingp  precodegtgtgt mystring  ABCELKJSDLHFWEHSJDHFKHIUEHFSDF gtgtgt sum[[, char] for char in mystring.lower], [] [, a, , b, , c, , e, , l, , k, , j, , s, , d, , l, , h, , f, , w, , e, , h, , s, , j, , d, , h, , f, , k, , h, , i, , u, , e, , h, , f, , s, , d, , f] codepre  pI am trying to make a list with the character codecode prepended before each letter in lower case. In this example, you need to use codesumcode to flatten the list. However, my question is, if it is possible to make a flat list in the first place. The output above is the desired output.p  pAs in, append something emconstantlyem before a variable that changes with each iteration of the codeforcode loop. One cannot use two codeforcode loops here, as that would be too simple, for examplep  precodemystring  ABCELKJSDLHFWEHSJDHFKHIUEHFSDF print [item for x in mystring.lower for item in [, x]] codepre  pIf one does something like thisp  precodegtgtgt mystring  ABCELKJSDLHFWEHSJDHFKHIUEHFSDF gtgtgt [[, x] for x in mystring] [, a, , b, , c, , e, , l, , k, , j, , s, , d, , l, , h, , f, , w, , e, , h, , s, , j, , d, , h, , f, , k, , h, , i, , u, , e, , h, , f, , s, , d, , f] codepre  pYou get lists within lists. Thus, is there a way that you can append two items at a time in a list comprehension without have to use an addition for loop or an additional function like codesumcode I ask this, because its something quite simple, yet I cant find a way to do it. If one tries to do the followingp  precodegtgtgt [, x for x in mystring.lower]   File ltconsolegt, line 1     [, x for x in mystring.lower]                SyntaxError invalid syntax codepre  pThe attempt gives a codeSyntaxErrorcode. So, is what Im asking impossible to do in Python Using codecode gives me a list of tuples.p  pIve also emtriedem using the codesplatcodecodeunpackingcode operatorp  precodegtgtgt [[, x] for x in mystring.lower]   File ltconsolegt, line 1     [[, x] for x in mystring.lower]       SyntaxError invalid syntax codepre  pBut as above, this too is a syntax error. Sorry for this late edit, but I emhaveem tried the followingp  precodeimport itertools mystring  HELLOWORLD printlistitertools.chain.fromiterable, x for x in mystring.lower codepre  pBut the above still required an import.p

Negative 215 pI think my problem is very simple and Im probably overlooking something incredibly obvious, but I havent been able to solve this for a little while now.p  pIn my current QT project, I have a 2 files, one of them is a window, another is a widget. My window calls upon my custom widget and creates an instance of it and injects it into the frame. This placing of the widget into the window is controlled by a button which can be clicked many times because I emultimatelyem want many instances of the widget on the screen at once.p  pHeres the problem Whenever a new instance of my widget is placed in the frame, they seem to just be mirroring each others values, meaning when I do stuff within the first instance of the widget, it happens in every instance of the widget however, it sometimes doesnt appear to update right away, but I know that it happens.  I want them to be emseparate instancesem which will in the future interact with each other. p  pHeres how Im handling injecting the widgetp  precode    void WindowonbtnNewCellclicked              uigtverLaygtaddWidgetnew Neuron      codepre  pAnd heres the main portion of my widgets codep  precodeinclude neuron.h include uineuron.h include qtimer.h   Define Neuron Properties int volt  70 int rest  70 int max  40   Logic Contol int excAmt  10 int inhAmt  10 bool refract  false bool timerActive bool st  true  NeuronNeuronQWidget parentQWidgetparent, uinew UiNeuron      uigtsetupUithis     Homeostatic Voltage Changing Timer     tiHom  new QTimerthis     connecttiHom, SIGNALtimeout, this, SLOTchangeVoltage,QtDirectConnection       Duration of mouse depression timer     tiPrs  new QTimerthis     connecttiPrs, SIGNALtimeout, this, SLOTchgVltg,QtDirectConnection      timerActive  false   NeuronNeuron      delete ui    CUSTOM METHODS void NeuronchangeVoltageint c      volt  volt  c      if volt gt max  begin action potential              volt  rest         timerActive  false         tiHomgtstop         uigtchkFiredgtsetCheckedtrue           if volt lt rest  to not drop below 40              if timerActive  true                      timerActive  false             tiHomgtstop                  volt  rest           else if volt gt rest  to drop it to 40              if timerActive  false                      timerActive  true             tiHomgtstart100                   uigtlblVoltgtsetTextQStringnumbervolt   void NeuronchangeVoltage      changeVoltage1   void NeuronchgVltg      if st  true              changeVoltageexcAmt          else         changeVoltageinhAmt  void NeuronupdateGlowint i, bool b      QPixmap pic     if b  true          if st  true pic.loadImagesExcitatory QStringnumberi .png         else pic.loadImagesInhibitory QStringnumberi .png         uigtlblEgtsetPixmappic         uigtlblEgtsetEnabledtrue         tiPrsgtstart100          else              uigtlblEgtsetEnabledfalse         tiPrsgtstop       many additional redundant methods for a lack of an efficient way of implementing them codepre

Negative 215 pIm relatively new to ReactJS and have been seduced by the ease of implementing serverside rendering to reduce time to first tweet. Im running a NodeExpressReact stack which prerenders the markup on the server using Reacts renderComponentToString.p  pIt works fine when the components can be rendered synchronously, however Im struggling when it comes to implementing ajaxpopulated components however this applies to any asynchronous operation during the initialization of the component, e.g. websocket.p  pTake the example from the React website a hrefhttpfacebook.github.ioreacttipsinitialajax.htmlhttpfacebook.github.ioreacttipsinitialajax.htmlap  precodecomponentDidMount function   .getthis.props.source, functionresult    var lastGist  result[0]   this.setState     username lastGist.user.login,     lastGistUrl lastGist.htmlurl    .bindthis codepre  pIt wont work on the server, since componentDidMount is never triggered when using renderComponentToString. This simple case can be worked around by using the same HTTP request wrapper on the client and on the server instead of using jQuerys .get, and by prefetching the data before instantiating the component and passing it as a prop.p  pHowever, in an actual, complex app, asynchronous dependencies can get very complicated and prefetching doesnt really fit the descendant approach of building React structures.  How can I implement an asynchronous initialization pattern in React that can be rendered on the server without actually mounting anything i.e. no DOM emulation a la PhantomJS, which is the whole point of using renderComponentToString p

Negative 215 pAt seemingly random intervals, I encounter the following error when attempting to debug programs in Delphi 7p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com79E5B.png altDelphi Errorp  pThe only way get rid of this error is to close and reopen Delphi and even when I do this I normally see the error again fairly quickly. Restarting my computer can sometimes be useful in stopping the problem from appearing for a while.p  pTo be clear, I am able to compile my project, its only when I attempt to debug that I have this problem. This seems to be the DLL responsible for debugging, which makes sense.p  pDelphi is running within a Windows XP SP3 Environment.p

Negative 215 pI want to create a database table that should hold lots of unique names, that may be used by other tables with reference.p  pExamplep  precodetable Country Germany USA France codepre  pShould I mark the String of these names as codeIdcode, or introduce another codeLong idcodep  precodeEntity class Country      Id private Long id      Id private String name eg Germany   Entity class Address      ManyToOne     private Country country  codepre  pI assume that it is better to have the names being referenced by an codeIdcode so that the names are not repeated within foreign keys in the Country table Or does this not matterp  pAre there any advantages if a new Address is not having a codeString countrycode field, but just a reference to the country because the same country name will be reused in several addresses, thus not having dublicate name entries in the address tables.p  pBut I could imagine that a drawback might be that I do not have the Country Id before persisting a address. Therefore, Id first have to check codeSELECT  FROM Country WHERE name  namecode, check if codenullcode and create a new Country entry, then creating the codeAddresscode.p  pWould you think it is better to use String or Long as Id herep

Negative 215 pstrongWhat I want to achievestrong  Making all the labels in the bottommost cell of a codeUITableViewcode gray and changing them back to their original colors as it scrolls up. In other words, kind of a gradient effect, just that all label colors have to be gray.br strongWhat I have achievedstrong  Added the original colors in an array and trying to determine which cell is at the bottom using codevisibleCellscode and then changing its label colors. But a lot of that code depends on manually determining offsets and thus seems scary to me.br strongWhat I have triedstrong Adding a codeCAGradientLayercode. But it makes the cell to fade away. I want the labels in the cell to turn gray. Similar, but not the same.br strongNotestrong The cell is a custom cell with labels, buttons and even a simple codeUITableViewcode, I need to store the colors for all these somewhere and then apply gray color till the cell is at the bottom. Once it scrolls up, I would have to recolor all the subviews again.br Can anyone suggest a better approach for achieving all thisbr strongAdded Questionstrong As suggested by Bamsworld below, is there a blend mode which can help me achieve this, i.e. a blend mode which would render all underlying text in gray I know of multiply blend mode, but have only a faint idea of others.p
Negative 215 pI have a parent process which listens for incoming connections on a socket and after accepting a client, It will pass the associated file descriptor and some other date to the child through a named pipe.p  pFrom this moment on, child process will provide service to the client and the parent keeps listening for new clients.p  pMy problem is that when I try to write on file descriptors in child process, I will get an error Bad file descriptor and write fails. My guess is that since these file descriptors are created after fork, child cannot simply use them and they only belong to the parent process.p  pSo Is this the reason of write failure Is there any possible way for child to use these file descriptorsp  pbr bSolutionb br As it was mentioned in the answer by loreb, It is not possible to achieve the desired outcome in this manner. I did a temporary fix by using another pipe to direct the response from child to parent. Since file descriptors belong to parent, it can forward the response back to client through a socket.p
Negative 215 pIm writing script to automate system administration tasks on my Linux system. p  pThis involves compressing, moving, deleting, renaming and searching a lot of files.

If I make it to show on hover the player wont work in iOS which brings me back to where I started.

Negative 215 pIm trying to style a file upload button to my personal preferences, but I couldnt find any really solid ways to do this without JS. I did find a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq32261671256925twoa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq36068761256925othera questions about this subject, but the answers there either involved JavaScript, or suggested a hrefhttpwww.quirksmode.orgdominputfile.htmlQuirksmodes approacha.p  pMy major issue with this Quirksmodes approach is that the file button will still have the browserdefined dimensions, so it wont automatically adjust to whatevers used as button thats placed below it.

Negative 215 pIm using EXTjs 4.2 and I would like to know if there is any way, using the LoadMask or other mechanism, to display default values to the rows of the grid while while scroll updown action is performed and the grid needs to load info rather than display the empty block of grid or the loading message.p  pSo, for example, after scroll down it will show something likep  precode      Column 1           Description        value 1             value 2               value 3             value 4               value 5             value 6               loading data...     loading data...       loading data...     loading data...       loading data...     loading data...      codepre  pThen, when the info is loaded it will show the received values, as normalp  precode      Column 1           Description        value 1             value 2               value 3             value 4               value 5             value 6               value 7             value 8               value 9             value 10              value 11            value 12             codepre  pIve already implemented it inserting manually all this rows with the Loading data... info and replacing it at the moment that I get the response, but this needs to use specific code to manage the requests and the store and thats why Im looking for a solution provided by the EXTjs library, if exists. Thanks.p
Negative 215 pI have a paged UICollectionView, with one cell per page. However, my UICollectionViewCells are slow to render third party library, no options there. So as an optimisation, i need to prerender the cells to the left and right of the current page, so scrolling is smooth.p  pWhat ive done is, inside my custom UICollectionViewLayout, is outset the passed rect by 1 point before checking to see which cells UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes should be returned, see herep  precode NSArray layoutAttributesForElementsInRectCGRectrect      CGRect outsetRect  CGRectInsetrect, 1, 0     return [myAttributes filterBOOLUICollectionViewLayoutAttributes attribs          return CGRectIntersectsRectattribs.frame, outsetRect     ]  codepre  pThis works as expected. However, when the actual UICollectionView does its thing, it seemingly ignores the offscreen cells and calls codecellForItemAtIndexPathcode only for the first cell, not the cell to the right or left.p  pAny ideas what is going on Thanksp

Negative 215 pI have a device info app on Google Play, and within the app I have storage information. I know in Android 4.4 there has been some changes in regards to accessing external SDcards. Internal doesnt seem to give me a problem. My question is, how can I reliably get the size of SDcards on KitKatp  pI have the required permissions listed, as this worked fine on earlier versions of Android. I have searched here on SO, and I always seem to get one of the same errors.

Negative 215 pIm creating a website for my new brand and as my first indepth encounter with jQuery, Ive found some issues relating to the state of a div. The if statements in the code check if the text of homebutton is equal to either blog or home, and then issue a different scrollTop command for each one. The problem is that I need to cease the jQuery function  say for instance if blog is the text, I dont want it to run the function which involves changing the text of homebutton to home AND THEN running the if text  home if statement as well because the text has changed. I need a way to either stop the jQuery function after it does one of the scrollTop commands or I would like someone to show me how to craft an IF statement that can eliminate this problem.p  precode        document.readyfunction                    askbutton.clickfunction               html, body.animate scrollTop 0 , fast             askpage.toggleslow             tumblrcontent.toggleslow             homebutton.textHOME                      window.scrollfunction              var targetDiv  homebutton             var matchHeight  tumblrcontent.position.top             ifdocument.body.scrollTop gt matchHeight                   this is where youre css amendments would be done                 if targetDiv.textBLOG   targetDiv.textHOME               else                  if targetDiv.textHOME  targetDiv.textBLOG                                 homebutton.clickfunction           if this.textHOME ampamp tumblrcontent.cssdisplay, none                 askpage.fadeOutslow                 tumblrcontent.fadeInslow                 html, body.animate scrollTop 0 , slow                  this.textBLOG                 if tumblrcontent is not shown and text says home, this means that askpage will be showing.                   if this.textHOME ampamp askpage.cssdisplay, none                 html, body.animate scrollTop 0 , slow                     if this.textBLOG ampamp askpage.cssdisplay, none               this.textHOME             html,body.animatescrollToptumblrcontent.offset.top, slow                     codepre

Each time I navigate back to the infinity directive adds an additional call to codeonScrollcodep  pFor examplep  pFirst time Ill see in the console.p  precodepageTop 300 markerTop 1000 pageTop 600 markerTop 1000 pageTop 900 markerTop 1000 codepre  pThe second time Ill see two lines printed for each scroll event like this.p  precodepageTop 300 markerTop 1000 pageTop 300 markerTop 1000 pageTop 600 markerTop 1000 pageTop 600 markerTop 1000 pageTop 900 markerTop 1000 pageTop 900 markerTop 1000 codepre  pAnd so on...p  pIt appears that the codeangular.elementwindow.bind..code is persistent and that I need to somehow unbind it when the directive is no longer used.p  pHow would I do that Should be noted that this directive does not have an isolated scope so I cant watch for the scope to be destroyed.p
Negative 215 pCross posting from a hrefhttpforums.gradle.orggradletopicsminmanifestmffilegeneratedthroughgradle relnofollowhttpforums.gradle.orggradletopicsminmanifestmffilegeneratedthroughgradleap  pI am seeing a problem with the jar manifest file in my gradle project.

Due to this, when I try to execute a java command using a main class that is contained in this projects jar, java errors as  codeError Could not find or load main classcode. This is presumably because the jar has a corrupt MANIFEST.MF. As soon as I unpack the jar, remove the M characters and rebuild the jar using jar cf, the java commands work.p  pI can see this error when I build both on OSX Mavericks as well as Centos 6.3. I am using gradle 1.11p  pIf this has to do with file encoding, is there a recommended way of setting the encoding Any other possible solutions to thisp  pThanks in advance,p  pBhooshanp  hr  pUPDATE This issue seems to occur because the methods codegetSCMRevisioncode and codegetSCMBranchcode are defined in a custom plugin. If I remove these methods, the MANIFEST.MF file does not contain M characters. If I completely move the manifest definition to the custom plugin, I see the issue. If I define everything in my projects build.gradle instead, I do not see the M characters. They seem to show up only if I invoke any functionality from the custom plugin in the manifest closure.p  pAny thoughtsp

On the next request, this is replaced by the next QNetworkReply, so Python should be able to free the previous request object and thus the underlying network resources. Instead, the old reply objects seem to get stuck somewhere, causing a memory leak, and if the app runs long enough, a delay on quit, presumably because all the requests ever issued are finally being deleted.p  pSimplified but complete examplep  precodeimport sys, signal from PySide import QtCore, QtNetwork  class PollerQtCore.QObject     url  QtCore.QUrlhttplocalhost5000      def initself, parentNone         superPoller,self.initparent         self.manager  QtNetwork.QNetworkAccessManager      def startself         request  QtNetwork.QNetworkRequestself.url         self.reply  self.manager.getrequest         self.reply.finished.connectself.readReply         self.reply.error.connectself.error      def readReplyself         text  self.reply.readAll         self.reply.close  doesnt help         self.reply.deleteLater  doesnt help         QtCore.QTimer.singleShot10, self.start      QtCore.SlotQtNetwork.QNetworkReply.NetworkError     def errorself, err         self.reply.finished.disconnect         sys.stderr.writeError   strerr  n         QtCore.QTimer.singleShot10, self.start  signal.signalsignal.SIGINT, signal.SIGDFL app  QtCore.QCoreApplicationsys.argv p  Poller p.start app.exec codepre  pThe http server being polled doesnt much matter for this test Im using a hrefhttpflask.pocoo.orgdocsquickstart relnofollowthe Flask hello worlda.

Negative 215 pbr I have a question regarding the licensing of open source Java libraries and the libraries they depend on.p  pWhen I include open source Java libraries into my closed source commercially distributed Java software, I need to check the licences of those open source libs, but do I need to check their dependencies as wellp  pSo if a open source library A uses the libraries B and C internally, do I need to check B and C libraries for their license compatability, too and then their used libs, too Libraries B and C could be packaged inside library A inside the jar file, or could be added as external dependencies, like in e.g. a pom.xml file for Maven you specify your dependency to library A in your project, and Maven automatically knows the dependencies for B and C and downloads them into your project.p  pDoes this differ from the used licence type, like ASLv2, MIT, LGL or EPLp  pThank you very much for your answersp  hr  pEdit As user Gimby noted in a comment, I do not search for legal advice of course. But your opinions and understandings of this topic are greatly appreciated. Strangely I cannot find anything about this issue anywhere, not even in the licences themselves.p

Negative 215 pI have a little uncommon fragment navigation, because I want to have app responsive. Due to that I use almost only showhide methods with fragments.p  pWhenever I want to navigate to another fragment and go back with the back key, I add this transaction to the backstack. With that, I also set the transition animation to that transaction, so that when a user presses back, it shows a reversal animation the effect of popBackStackImmiediate, when user goes to previous fragment.p  pI add these animations byp  precodefragmentTransaction.setTransitionFragmentTransaction.TRANSITFRAGMENTOPEN codepre  pLets call it A  B  A navigation. So when A is moved to B, an opening animation is shown, and then when we go back to A, a reversal animation is shown.p  pHowever the problem arrises, when I have a situation where I need to go from A to B adding this transaction to back stack to be able to return to A with back button, and then from B to C not adding this transaction to back stack, and from C to A when pressing back button. The problem in this scenario is that I want the user to be brought immidietly to A fragment when pressing back button on that C fragment. However, because there was animation added to transaction from A to B, and that transaction was added to back stack, when user presses back button on fragment C, the reversal transaction AB is being shown in effect, the fragment B flashes for a fraction of a second on a screen, before fragment A is displayed.p  pIt would all run beautifully if I was able to get to the transaction object in AB transaction and disable that transition animation. However it seems this operation has no effect after a commit has been done.p  pIs there anyway I can disable that animationp

Negative 215 pI have two applications, a standard javaspring web app and a spring rest api in reality, I have several rest apis, some of which are ideal for sharing across several web apps, but that doesnt change the example. When a user logs into the webapp, I want them to be able to seamlessly also make ajax calls GET and POST to the rest api, which is also secured with CAS. p  pSo far it seems like the suggested approach for this is to get a proxy granting ticket in the webapp, and use it to generate a ticket that could be used to call the rest api. This however means that ajax calls made from the client page have to be proxied through the web app. p  pAre there any other means available to make this happen without the proxy through the webapp Not all the rest endpoints are secured some are meant to be public and I realize I can cut down on the use of the proxy by directly using the rest api for those, but still, it feels heavy having to double the processing for the other requests. p  pOne idea I had, which I dont know if its possible, is instead of proxying through the webapp, what if the webapp could return the proxy ticket to client, and then the ajax calls could me made with that Seems like thats not recommended thoughp

Negative 215 pI am working on an security remediation of an existing java web application. The application has some dynamic sql code executed by JDBC.But, this is not  accepted by Static Code analysis tool we use. So, I am looking for a way to remediate the issue.Basically, I have validated all the input passed to code which constructs the query , so there is no possiblity of SQL Injection. But, the SCA tool still does not approve of this validation. So, want to know if there is any way I can avoid Dynamic Query logic. Prepared Statements cannot be used as the query is dynamicly constructed based on conditions. p  pI know Stored Procedure can help. But, I understand it has its own issues and the team is also not experienced on Stored Procedures. So, looking for a better way to address this issue.

Negative 215 pIm battling with iOS 8 performance problems.  Updating to iOS 8 has literally made my application near unusable on iPad 2s.  There are some fundamental performance issues that Im trying to iron out to see if I can avoid them or at least lessen the effect of them on my application.  One problem is dragging UIImageViews.  Theres something very different about how the TouchesMoved function gets called with UIImageViews.  p  pa hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvxP1BWweCAio relnofollowPlease see my video below for a full descriptiona, but here are my current findings.  Im using the TouchesMoved function in UIImageViews to drag objects across the screen when the user drags his finger across the screen.  p  precode    public override void TouchesMoved NSSet touches, UIEvent evt              base.TouchesMoved touches, evt          UITouch touch  touches.AnyObject as UITouch         PointF TouchLocationold  TouchLocation         TouchLocation  touch.LocationInView this.Superview       Console.WriteLineTouchLocation    TouchLocation          float offsetX  TouchLocation.X  TouchLocationold.X         float offsetY  TouchLocation.Y  TouchLocationold.Y         Center  new PointFCenter.X  offsetX, Center.Y  offsetY      codepre  pIn my project, as soon as i modify the position of the object im dragging, there seems to be some sort of delay or throttle to the TouchesMoved Event.  Normally, the TouchesMoved event goes of every couple milliseconds, but in iOS 8 in some situations its going off every 120 ms causing lag spikes when dragging objects across the screen.  Why is this  What about iOS 8 and the TouchesMoved function has changedp  pAdditional note, Ive noticed that a large number of UIViews added to the view controller causes this.  For some reason in iOS 7, adding a large number of UIViews to the view controller didnt effect it as much, but in iOS 8 it causes the TouchesMoved function to be called less frequently possibly because its iterating through all of the views to determine if its touching them  But iOS 7 would have done that too right  Did something in iOS 8 make that process more time consuming  Ive also noticed UIScrollViews become heavier and slower much quicker in iOS 8 as well, where as in iOS 7 they were working smoothly with that same number of subviews.  p  pAdded hardware infop  piPad 2 MC969LLA on iOS 7.1.2p  piPad Mini MD528LLA on iOS 8.0p  pAdded findingsp  pin iOS 8, large numbers of UIViews within your View Controllers View are lagging the performance of CAKeyframeAnimations as well.  Though this test case isnt as extreme as seen in my application, Ive proven this TouchesMoved issue out in an isolated test case below.  p  pa hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvmuXJZ76sNm0 relnofollowVideo demoing the projecta  p  pa hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsr39de35p72t1g4eTestIOS7vsIOS8202.zipdl0 relnofollowXamarin Studio Project via Dropboxap

Negative 215 pThe title doesnt really cover it all. Its basically the following use casep  ul liSelect a bunch of items in a listviewli liMove to the next activityli liShow the selected items in this new activity in a listviewli liIf the user decides to move to the previous section the same items should still be checkedli ul  pIf I were using POJOs I could simply add an OnItemClickListener to the ListView and add the items to an array each time user clicks an item and ship this array to the new Activity. However the ListView is populated using a Loader which gets the data from a ContentProvider and puts it in a SimpleCursorAdapter.p  pIn the current state I can think of a few possible solutionsp  p1 Add an extra column to the relevant table of the objects in the ListView. Each time the user selects an item this column is updated to indicate it is selected.p  pThis has a few advantagesp  ul liOnce I have moved to the next Activity I can simply query for all selected items.li liWhen moving to the previous activity I can use this column to show a selected view.li ul  pBut also a few disadvantagesp  ul liRequires an update each time an item is clicked, triggering the loader.li liRequires a custom adapter which uses the state of the new column to decide whether it should or should not be shown as checked. Possibly creating a delay between clicking an item and actually showing it as checked. li liThe default check options in the ListView will be unusableli ul  p2 Track the IDs of checked items using OnItemClickedListener or getCheckedItemIds and pass them to the next Activity. In the new activity I then create a selection argument of ID   OR  repeating N times and excluding the last OR and use the given array as the selection arguments.p  pAdvantagesp  ul liNo need to keep updating the database.li liNo extra columns in the database.li liItem checking has no extra delay.li liDefault check options from the listview still usableli ul  pDisadvantagesp  ul liMoving to the previous activity is now harder. I could return the list of selected item IDs, but the listview only has the option setItemChecked which takes a position. So Id have to iterate over the entire adapter to find the positions of the items and set them as checked. li ul  pIm probably capable of implementing them without any hassle. At the moment Im gravitating towards the second option.p  pstrongSo ultimately I have the following questionsstrongp  ol liIs there an easier way to do this in Android.li liWhat would be a good way to recheck the items see the disadvantage in the second suggestion and if theres no better way to do it.li ol  psubThis ListView will also get a search function which will probably again make it a bit harder because if Im not mistaken filtering resets it every time. So Id also have to recheck items every time ideally during filtering. subp

Negative 215 pI need to tune PID gains in a system which has a quite large delay. Its a common temperature controller, but the temperature probe is far away from the heater. Some further infop  ul lipthe response of the probe is delayed about 10 seconds from any change on the heaterpli lipthe temperature is sampled  1 Hz, with a resolution of 0.01 Cpli lipthe heater is controller in PWM with a period of 1 Hz, with a 10bit PWMpli lipthe goal is to maintain the oscillation below 0.05 Cpli ul  pCurrently Im using the controller as PI. I cant avoid oscillations. The higher the gain, the smaller and faster the oscillations. Still too high about 0.15 C. Reducing the P and I gains leads to very long and deep oscillations.p  pI think this is due to the delay. The settling time is not a problem, it may take all the time it needs.p  pIm puzzling over how get the system to work. Lets think to use only I. When the probe reaches the target value and the I output starts to decrease, the temperature will rise for some other time. I cannot use the derivative term because the variations are too slow and the dError is very close to zero if I set the dGain to a huge value there is too much noise.p  pAny ideap

Would it be better to just use fixed properties like that, thoughp  pThank you all in advance for any help you can providep

Also, another code keeps reading data serially via the serial port and every time a new set of data is read by one set I mean one minute long data  there are 15 channels and 128 Hz sampling rate 128607680 ie every minute I get an array of 7680  15 as input., I increment the counter in another index.pickle file.Let us say that the value of counter in index.pickle is X now .Then the next data set of one min read is saved as EEGClenchingX.pickle .Then counter value in index.pickle is updated to X1 So here in , I ve written a code to live plot the data once every minute. Sadly , my animation only updates once though the data files are present and the counter in index.pickle updates every minuteI can see it happening.p  pKindly Helpp  pCode p    precodeimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.animation as animation import pickle import numpy  rate    128     sampling rate of epoc. time    60  duration of sampling as defined in epoccollect.py code.  fig     plt.figure1 ax1     fig.addsubplot 511 ax2     fig.addsubplot 512 ax3     fig.addsubplot 513 ax4     fig.addsubplot 514 ax5     fig.addsubplot 515  fig     plt.figure2 ax6     fig.addsubplot 511 ax7     fig.addsubplot 512 ax8     fig.addsubplot 513 ax9     fig.addsubplot 514 ax10    fig.addsubplot 515  fig     plt.figure3 ax11    fig.addsubplot 411 ax12    fig.addsubplot 412 ax13    fig.addsubplot 413 ax14    fig.addsubplot 414   def animatei     print value of i     print i      indexname  index.pickle     with openindexname as f             index  pickle.loadf     index     intindex 1     index     strindex      print index no     print index     filename  EEGClenching index .pickle     pullData  pickle.load open filename, rb        refval   []     channel1  []     channel2  []     channel3  []     channel4  []      channel5  []     channel6  []     channel7  []     channel8  []     channel9  []     channel10 []     channel11 []     channel12 []     channel13 []     channel14 []      x        ratetime     for j in range x          refval.appendj128  intpullData[j,0]         channel1.appendintpullData[j,1]         channel2.appendintpullData[j,2]         channel3.appendintpullData[j,3]         channel4.appendintpullData[j,4]         channel5.appendintpullData[j,5]         channel6.appendintpullData[j,6]         channel7.appendintpullData[j,7]         channel8.appendintpullData[j,8]         channel9.appendintpullData[j,9]         channel10.appendintpullData[j,10]                channel11.appendintpullData[j,11]         channel12.appendintpullData[j,12]         channel13.appendintpullData[j,13]         channel14.appendintpullData[j,14]       ax1.clear     ax2.clear     ax3.clear     ax4.clear     ax5.clear     ax6.clear     ax7.clear     ax8.clear     ax9.clear     ax10.clear     ax11.clear       ax12.clear      ax13.clear          ax14.clear           ax1.plotrefval,channel1       ax2.plotrefval,channel2     ax3.plotrefval,channel3     ax4.plotrefval,channel4     ax5.plotrefval,channel5     ax6.plotrefval,channel6     ax7.plotrefval,channel7     ax8.plotrefval,channel8     ax9.plotrefval,channel9     ax10.plotrefval,channel10     ax11.plotrefval,channel11     ax12.plotrefval,channel12     ax13.plotrefval,channel13     ax14.plotrefval,channel14      animation.FuncAnimationfig,animate,frames  30,interval60000 plt.show codepre

Negative 215 pIve setup a file upload form that lets users drop files onto the page and then the user can add these images. You can put 1 or 50 images, it doesnt matter.

The files I try uploading are .PNGfiles and accumulate maybe 1 to 2 MB at most.

Negative 215 pI have two different array formats I need to pass to JavaScript for some form of rendering. I dont have to use both formats, I will pick one based on whats easiest to pass to JS. p  p1 The first format is the one described in this other question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27988514howdoiconvertanarraywithajsonstringintoajsonobjectrubyHow do I convert an Array with a JSON string into a JSON object rubya Its essentially an array of items that represent a custom structure that has been created off an original hash. In my ruby program I can refer to a value as codecustomer[3].namecode p  p2 the second format is an array of items that are more like a native hash. So in my ruby program I can refer to them as codecustomer[3][name]code. It is important to note that in this format name isnt a symbol but rather a string that is what I get as input. p  pFor my preliminary tests I have used gonsinatra a hrefhttpsgithub.comgazaygonsinatra relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgazaygonsinatraa to pass variables from Sinatra to JS. It works fine as I have access to my gon.customers array in JS but I cant find a waysyntax to extract in JS all customers names for example or all customers ids or all customers descriptions and manipulate them in my JS code. p  pAt this point I am not sure if my problem is the handoff from Sinatra to JavaScript, or if the handsoff is ok and I am just having a hard time with the basic JS syntax. p  pI am not bound to use either array formats I am flexible nor I am bound to use gonsinatra albeit it appears that it makes the handoff totally transparent. p  pSuggestions p  pThanks   p

Negative 215 pI am very new to PHP and a beginner programmer. I have struggled with this issue for four days and I am finally posting my first question here for help.p  pI have built a test environment using XAMPP on my PC and have had good success with developing PHPHTML content locally and then putting it up live on my hosting companys server.p  pHowever I am running into an issue when using PHP fopen to open a text file. It works perfect on the live server but does not work locally on the test server. I get this error on the test server. p  blockquote   p...failed to open stream No such file or directory...p blockquote  pThe file I am trying to open exists locally and on the live server in the same relative path from the site root.p  pI believe the issue is due to the fact that the actual path to the file on my hosting server is different from actual path on my test server. My hosted server company requires I use a specific path just to get to the root of my website when accessing files. It goes something like this codehomeuserswebb54321moo.mysitecodep  pHowever, the actual PC path to get to my testing domain root is codecvhostsmysitecodep  pI thought I had found the answer myself earlier in that I have to modify the codeltIfModule aliasmodulegtcode section on my testing environments httpd.conf file by creating an Alias. I tried that but did not have success. Not sure if I am on the right track but here is what I tried.p  pcodeAlias homeuserswebb54321moo.mysite  Cvhostsmysitecodep  pThis did not work and after reading more details realized this seems to only be specific to URLs and not PHP file paths.p  pAny assistance would be greatly appreciated. Sorry if this is a basic question. I have been searching and trying various fixes without a resolution.p  pHere is the actual Code that works on the live server but fails on the test server.

Negative 215 pIm struggling with the jquery Lazyload script when I combine this with a simple jquery filter. At first glance it all seems to work nicely, however when i combine this with filtering Im runnign into trouble. In essence, when I apply the filter, the images which were originally positioned below the fold i.e. those which had not yet been scrolled down to are not shown, only the placeholder and there is no way that I can see to change this.p  pCan someone please help Im guessing that its something relatively straightforward.

I worked backwards and found that at the end of the codeiCreateAPostcode method the current url is the one that corresponds to the codestorecode method of my controller, when in reality the controller redirects to the codeadminpostseditcode page. So something must be failing just after the codepressButtonCreate Postcode action.p  pHow can I debug this I cant seem to find any better way to view the flow of requests and responses other the codeprintLastResponsecode which isnt much use. I dont think its a validation problem and my other feature tests work suggesting its not a database issue.p  pFor reference here is the test outputp  precode  Scenario Post Creation                                  featuresposts.feature6     Given I have an account john johnexample.com      FeatureContextiHaveAnAccount     When I create a post Example Post Example Content  FeatureContextiCreateAPost        httplocalhostadminpostsstore     Then I should see a post Example Post                FeatureContextiShouldSeeAPost        httplocalhostadminposts       The text Example Post was not found anywhere in the text of the current page.

Negative 215 pI am a junior level developer and I have a situation where a previous developer wrote an aspx page, named with a guid, so as not to be accidentally accessed by a user. Its function is to call stored procedures to get a list of recipients, and populate a DataTable. Then use NPOI.dll to export the dt to an excel workbook and email it to the recipient list. There are no controls in the front end, its all triggered on page load. This page is called once a week by setting this page as the default page on the servers browser, and setting a job on the server to start the browser. All of this actually worked well for quite a while, however, now the client would like to remove the page from the site and use an alternate method to generate and send the weekly report. Heres my question. Can I compile this codebehind into an .exe application that can be called by a server job Or is there a better way to approach this Any recommendations andor guidance would be appreciatedI have searched and could find no relevant discussions.p

Negative 215 pI have been playing around with codeecryptfscode to manually mountunmount a private store via codeecryptfsmountprivatecode and codeecryptfsumountprivatecode. When Im logged in as a user with codeecryptfscode configured ie username is strongbobstrong, it asks for my login password for my Linux user account in order to mount the private store. If I change my password while Im logged into the system via the codepasswdcode command line utility, codeecryptfscode requires my new password in order to mount the private store.p  pIf I log in as the coderootcode user ie sysadmin and change the password for the strongbobstrong account via codesudo passwd bobcode, and then log into Bobs account, codeecryptfsmountprivatecode will fail when I use the new password I set while logged in as coderootcode.p  pMy understanding is that codeecryptfscode uses a hash of the user password to generate another hashkey thats used to wrap the encrypted files in the private store. But if thats the case, why does it just work when I change the password when logged in as the actual user, but not when I reset the password as rootp  pMy best guess so far is that maybe some setting is passed to the codepasswdcode utility which causes it to run a secondary script after completion. Does anyone know for sure how this works with codeecryptfscodep  pThanksp

But I have another website that Scrapy cannot log on to because of the following issue There are no form elements on the page.p  pThe username and password fields, and the submit button are not in a form element, instead they are in a table element, which makes it a bit confusing. How can I make Scrapy log into the webpage using the tabletr elements....and not the form elementp  pAny help would be appreciatedp  precodeclass LoginSpiderBaseSpider    name  project

Negative 215 pBy drawing layer I mean a layer where the user can manually draw lines, circles or other shapes. And by normal layers I mean the layers described in the graphics32 layers example the layers that can be moved or resized at runtime using mouse events So I am having difficulties combining these 2 types of layers. In my test project, for now, I will assume I only have one drawing layer and multiple PNG layers. So in my project I set properties for the ImgView32 in the OnFormCreate likep  precodeprocedure TForm1.FormCreateSender TObject begin   AWidth 800   AHeight 600   FillColorclWhite    with ImgView do   begin     Selection  nil     RBLayer  nil     Layers.Clear     Scale  1     Scaledtrue     Bitmap.SetSizeAWidth, AHeight     Bitmap.DrawMode  dmTransparent     Bitmap.ClearFillColor   end end codepre  pAfter this, onClick of a button, I add a number of layers containing transparent PNG images. So its like thisp  precodeprocedure TForm1.Button1ClickSender TObject begin   AddPNGLayer1   AddPNGLayer2   AddDrawingLayer   AddPNGLayer3 end codepre  pI wont elaborate here the adding of PNG layers in order to keep the question short. I will only say that it uses a different onMouseDown event layerMouseDown than the one used in the drawingLayer and the AddDrawingLayer is as followsp  precodeprocedure TForm1.AddDrawingLayer var   PTPoint   jumaH, JumaW, W, H Single begin   imwidth  ImgView.Bitmap.Width   imheight  ImgView.Bitmap.Height    xofx  ImgView.ClientWidth  17  imwidth div 2  substracting the width of the scrollbar   yofy  ImgView.ClientHeight  17  imheight div 2  same here with height    bm32  TBitmap32.Create   bm32.DrawMode  dmTransparent   bm32.SetSizeImgView.Bitmap.Width,ImgView.Bitmap.Height   bm32.Canvas.Pen.Width  3   bm32.Canvas.Pen.Color  clBlack32pencolor    BB  TBitmapLayer.CreateImgView.Layers   try     BB.Bitmap.DrawMode  dmTransparent     BB.Bitmap.SetSizeimwidth,imheight     BB.Bitmap.Canvas.Pen.Width  3     BB.Bitmap.Canvas.Pen.Color  pencolor     BB.Location  GR32.FloatRect0, 0, imwidth, imheight     BB.Scaled  true     BB.Tag3     SelectionBB   if I use this then I cant draw because the entire layer is selected and the mouseDown event works as a moverresizer     BB.OnMouseDown  DrLayerMouseDown     BB.OnMouseUp  DrLayerMouseUp     BB.OnMouseMove  DrLayerMouseMove     BB.OnPaint  DrLayerOnPaint     RBLayernil     EdLayerIndex.TextIntToStrBB.Index   finally     BB.Free   end   FDrawingLine  false     swapBuffers32  needed when mouse events are active end codepre  pEdLayerIndex is a EditBox where I display the createdselected Layer index for debuggingp  ul liAs you can see above, if I keep codeSelectionBBcode and codeRBLayernilcode then the drawingLayer is only movable and resizable, so its not a good solution since I want to use my Mouse events in this particular layer to draw. li lipIf I comment only the codeRBLayernilcode while keeping codeSelectionBBcode then the drawingLayer is not movable anymore, but I cannot select other layers that are emunderem the drawingLayer. I can only access the top layer the last added PNG layerpli lipIf I comment the codeSelectionBBcode then I cannot select other layers with my mouse. So in my case I declared 2 png layers before my drawingLayer and one after it. On runtime I can only select the last layer the one above the drawingLayer So this is not a solution either.pli ul  pHow can I do it that when I click on the drawing layer or select it otherwise, like in a listbox or something, the drawingLayer wont be movable, but my drawing Mouse Events will kick in And all this while I can go away from the drawingLayer whenever I want and select other layers to move around and play with. So basically I need a particular layer to NOT act like the other layers.p  pWhat I want to achieve is having a classic Photoshoplike or paint.net like behavior using graphics32. And it is very confusing how these layer properties actually work.p  pSo far I figured out how to draw lines, circles, rectangles on a transparent layer dynamically using mouse events. So I can have a drawing layer. The drawing happens in my codeDrLayerMouseDowncode, codeDrLayerMouseUpcode, codeDrLayerMouseMovecode, codeDrLayerPaintcode events. But I cannot seem to understand how to combine such a drawing layer with regular movableresizable layers.p  pThe rest of the code like codesetSelectioncode, codeRBResizingcode and codelayerMouseDowncode is mostly taken from the layers example of the graphics32 library.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIn order to test your idea with codelayerOptionscode, I did the followingp  p1.Started a new test project with an ImgView on it, and a buttonp  p2.On create i used the same code as beforep  p3.OnButtonClick I added ONE layer using a modified AddDrawingLayer like thisp  precode...     BB.Scaled  true     SelectionBB     Selection.LayerOptionsSelection.LayerOptions and not LOBMOUSEEVENTS  I also tried it with BB instead of Selection     BB.OnMouseDown  DrLayerMouseDown     BB.OnMouseUp  DrLayerMouseUp     BB.OnMouseMove  DrLayerMouseMove     BB.OnPaint  DrLayerOnPaint ... codepre  pexpecting it to become insensitive to Mouse Events. But the layer is still movable instead of being insensitive to mouse. So its like I did not do anythingp  pSo I do not think it helps me using this option unless I am doing it wrong So onCreate of the layer, this option does not seem to stick. But if I disable mouse events for all layers, onebyone like in the next EDIT, then the drawing layer gets disabled mouse eventsp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAlso I tried another test project, same idea same onCreate, and onButtonClick I add 3 layers using the Layers example of the library containing an image each no drawing layer this time, to keep it simple. Then I added a new button where if you click it, the next code is executedp  precode  for i  0 to ImgView.Layers.Count1 do     ImgView.Layers.Items[i] as TPositionedLayer.LayerOptions ImgView.Layers.Items[i] as TPositionedLayer.LayerOptions and not LOBMOUSEEVENTS codepre  pMy purpose was to make all layers insensitive to mouse events. I succeeded, after clicking the new button, the layers could not be selected anymore, however when I wanted to reenable mouse events for the layers adding a third button with the next code onClickp  precode  for i  0 to ImgView.Layers.Count1 do     ImgView.Layers.Items[i] as TPositionedLayer.LayerOptions ImgView.Layers.Items[i] as TPositionedLayer.LayerOptions and LOBMOUSEEVENTS codepre  pNo error was shown, but when I tried to select a layer in order to move it ... all the images of the layers disappeared from the view... leaving me with a white background empty ImgView.p  pWhat am I doing wrong In order to do what you suggested with LayerOptions, I need to be able to disable mouse events for all layers, and enable mouse events for a specific layer, and then when editing is done, I need to be able to reenable mouse events for all layers, but I am doing it wrong I guess.p

Ive tried for about 3 days and just cant figure out why my code isnt working, and the more I work at it the more frustrated I get.     public class TwoSmallest  public static void mainString[] args p  precodeSystem.out.printHow many numbers will you be inputing  int howManyNums  IO.readInt  int[] arrayScores  new int[howManyNums]  forint j  0j lt howManyNumsj     System.out.printInuput number j1      arrayScores[j]IO.readInt  int tinyNum1  arrayScores[0] int tinyNum2  arrayScores[1]     forint m  0tinyNum1 lt arrayScores[m]m         if tinyNum1 lt m              tinyNum1  arrayScores[m]                   for int n  1tinyNum2 lt arrayScores[n]n         if tinyNum2 lt n              tinyNum2  arrayScores[n]                  if tinyNum2 lt tinyNum1             int swapTinyNum1  tinyNum1             tinyNum2  swapTinyNum1                      System.out.printlnSmallest number tinyNum1         System.out.printlnFollowed by tinyNum2      codepre  pWe use the IO.readInt for user input which I use to define the size of the array. I use it again at arrayScores[j]IO.readInt to load the array. It kind of works when the user inputs the lower numbers first, but not when the higher numbers are input first. I think Im having problems with retrieving the value at the designated index. Its probably a mess, but if anyone can help me out, it would definitely be appreciated.

Negative 215 pIm banging my head on this, but, frankly speaking, my brains wont get it  or so it seems.p  pI have a column family that holds jobs for a rather large group of actors. It is a central job management and scheduling table that must be distributed and available throughout the whole cluster and possibly even traverses datacenter barriers some day in the near future.p  pEach job executor actor system, the ones that actually execute the jobs, is installed alongside one Cassandra node  that is, on the same node. Actually of course there is s master actor that pulls the jobs and distributes them to the actor agents, but that has nothing to do with my question. p  pThere are also some actor systems that can create jobs in the central job table to be executed by other actors or even actor systems, but usually the jobs are loaded batch wise or manually through a web interface.p  pAn actor that is to execute a job always only queries its local cassandra node. If finished, it will update the job table to indicate it is finished. This write should, in normal circumstances, also only update records with jobs, for which his local Cassandra node is authoritative.p  pNow, sometimes it may happen that an actor system on a given host has nothing to do. In this case it should indeed get jobs from other nodes too, but of course it will still only talk to its local Cassandra node. I know this works and it doesnt bother me a bit.p  pWhat keep me up at night is thisp  pHow would I create a compound key to achieve the local authoritative of a Cassandra node for job entries for its local actor system and thereby its job execution actors, without splitting the job table in multiple column families or the likep  pIn other words how can I create a compound key that makes sure that a jobs are evenly distributed through my cluster and  b a local query on the job table only returns jobs for which this Cassandra node is authoritative and c my distributed agent system still has the possibility to fetch jobs from other nodes, in case it has no own jobs to executep  pA last word on c above. I do not want to do 2 queries in the case there is no local job, but still only on p  pAny hints on thisp  pThis is general structure of job table so farp  precodeClusterKey    UUID Primary Key JobScope    String HOST  GLOBAL  SERVICE  CHANNEL JobIdentifier    String WebCrawler, Twitter Description    String  URL    String JobType    String FETCH  CLEAN  PARSE  Job    String Definition of the job AdditionalData    Collection  JobStatus      String NEW  WORKING  FINISHED  User    String  ValidFrom    Timestamp  ValidUntill    Collection  codepre  pStill in the process setting everything up, so no query so far defined.

Negative 215 pAs per my understanding when an Object is no longer required it is best practice to unsubscribe all event handlers in any Objects that subscribes to events. p  pThis is done to avoid handling an event within an Object when the given Object may reside in a invalid state no doubt among other reasons that Im probably unaware of.p  pGiven the above, I have found myself implementing codeIDisposiblecode on all my Objects that register any form of event handlers. However, this creates the obvious complexity of having to explicitly call codeDisposecode on the given object. p  pIn the end, I find myself uncertain if this extra complexity is required or if I should simply perform the event unsubscription in the object destructor. However this obviously leaves open the possibility of unexpected behavior given that Object destruction is nondeterministic.p  pSo should all Objects that register for events be codeIDisposablecode Or is there an alternative approach that is better suitedp

PLAN,FOR  are prefix....ZZTT,XXYY  are suffixp  pHeres the question  How do I split this into the three elements cleanly or Pythonicly into prefix, fName, and Suffix fName length varies and needs the  if it is there. Ive been able to manipulate and remove , however then get tripped up with the prefix length being 3 strongorstrong 4 chars when it comes to trying to obtain only fName with or without the .  I get tripped and cannot chose the correct number of chars.p  pOh, I can extract the Prefix fine, and check its existence in a tuple of legal values.  Is there a way to select the Prefix from that Tuple easily  Id be able to use that instead or trying to parse it from the file, as an option.  p  pCode is test code.  Print statements are for dev benefit and will not appear in final code.  Some of the tests are for my comprehension on how Py handles this stuff.

I also may have whitespace at the beginning or end of the line so I have to call codetrimcode on the line before I split it, which also creates another codeStringcode object. The garbage collector disposes of these codeStringcode objects, which results in slowdowns. Are there more memory efficient constructs in Java to do this I was thinking about using a codechar[]code instead of a codeStringcode but Im not sure whether there would be a substantial improvement from that.p

Negative 215 pIm creating an application that runs a Java server in the background and outputs to a console listbox with each new line. However, I want to be able to create a timer for example that constantly reads the console listbox for certain predetermined things but not specific.p  pFor example, if the server outputs [173250 INFO] Matt[127.0.0.1]logged in with entity ID 233 at [world]coordinates in world and adds it to the console listbox as an item, I want to be able to just grab the Matt part and add it to a list of players currently online in a players listbox. The entity ID and coordinates in world will be different every time so cannot be determined.p  pAs well as this Id like to do the same thing when the player disconnects, the console listbox will add an item that will say Matt left the game and Id need it to be able to search the players listbox for Matt and remove that item.p  pIm wondering if this is possible, apologies if this isnt very clearp

Negative 215 pI am trying to do a find a replace but not just for strings but for substrings also. So the program I am working on looks for the word bar and append foo in front of any instance of bar. So my approach is that instead of actually appending the string, I replace the whole string bar with foobar.

Negative 215 pThe problem is given as follows Given a DAG and a number code0 lt p  1code, return the minimumcardinality set of vertices that disconnects at least a codepcodefraction of paths from a source i.e., no incoming arcs to a sink i.e., no outgoing arcs. For codep  1code, the problem is equivalent to minimum cut. For other values of codepcode, however, Im not sure what the answer will be.p  pAn algorithm Im thinking of is to first compute the mincut set for a DAG and then try to prune it to satisfy the criteria. This by itself is interesting to see if the subset that we find is actually the minimum cutset for the specific codepcode that is given. The problem with this algorithm is that it is wasteful, because it computes many nodes that we dont need in the final answer and in fact, is solving bigger problem in the first place.p  pAny pointers to the solution of this problem wouldnt it be possible that for some of the algorithms of mincut, we put this extra constraint as an earlystopping criterionp  pFor checking how many paths are removed, suppose we have indexed each vertex and will keep it updated if needed so that we know how many paths get disconnected by their removal. Please do not worry for the complexity of the index being updated. One last thing, there is no constraint on the resulting components in terms of size or anything.p
