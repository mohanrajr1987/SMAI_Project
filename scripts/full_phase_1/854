Positive 854 pI encountered a nonlinear system of equations that has to be solved. The system of equations can be written as codeAx  expx  bcode with codebcode a known codeNx1code matrix, codeAcode a known codeNxNcode matrix, and codexcode the unknown codeNx1code vector for which has to be solved. The codeexpcode is defined elementwise on the codexcode vector. I tried to search the MATLABmanual but Im having a hard time finding how to solve this kind of equations with MATLAB, so I hope someone can help me out.p

Positive 854 pI am generating a bar graph of something vs time of day i.e., 24 hours. Later, my supervisor tells me that in the dataset, the time is offset by 8 hours, so 7 PM needs to become 3 AM, 12 midnight needs to become 8 AM, etc. In other words, the two axes should remain unaffected. Only the plots in the graph need to be made to shift towards the right by 8 hours i.e., in a circular kind of pattern, where each value is offset by 8. So, is there a simple, single line function or something to do this in MATLAB Thanks.p  pThis is my codep  precodeastr2numdatestrn,186400,HH   barhistca,uniquea codepre

Positive 854 pI would like to generate 3D white objects in blackwhite images using Matlabs nlfilter or a similar functiontool. p  pIn 2D, I start with some white seed points, which eventually define the regionsobjects in my 2D image.

Positive 854 pImagine you have a function in MATLAB of two variables, codefx,ycode.

Negative 854 pI am creating a custom Label control by simply Inheriting the standard Label control and repainting the background and text because I need a very specific background and border.  In the constructor of the control, I set the AutoSize property to false so I can have a standard default size for the new label.p  precode Public Sub New      Set the default size of the control to 75x24     Me.Height  24     Me.Width  75      Turn off the autosize property.     Me.AutoSize  False      Turn on doublebuffering.     Me.DoubleBuffered  True   End Sub codepre  pIn my application that uses this control, if I create the new custom label at run time in code, the AutoSize property stays False, and it works properly.p  pIf I try to add the new custom label to my form at design time, it comes in with the AutoSize property set to True, and I have to manually set it to False in the properties window.  Its not a huge problem, but I dont understand why the behavior is different.p  pAny ideas what is causing this difference in behaviorp
Negative 854 pIm having a weird problem with some python processes running using a watchdog process.p  pThe watchdog process is written in python and is the parent, and has a function called startchildname which uses emsubprocess.Popenem to open the child process. The Popen object is recorded so that the watchdog can monitor the process using strongpollstrong and eventually end it with strongterminatestrong when needed.  If the child dies unexpectedly, the watchdog calls startchildname again and records the new Popen object.p  pThere are 7 child processes, all of which are also python. If I run any of the children manually, I can send SIGTERM or SIGINT using emkillem and get the results I expect the process ends.p  pHowever, when run from the watchdog process, the child will only end after the strongFIRSTstrong signal. When the watchdog restarts the child, the new child process no longer responds to SIGTERM or SIGINT. I have no idea what is causing this.p  pstrongwatchdog.pystrongp  precodeclass watchdog  ltsnipgt various init stuff  def startself self.running  true  kids  [app1, app2, app3, app4, app5, app6, app7] self.processes    for kid in kids self.startchildkid  self.thread  threading.Threadtargetself.monitor self.thread.start  while self.running time.sleep10  def startchildself, name try proc  subprocess.Popenname self.processes[name]  proc except print oh no else print started child ok  def monitorself while self.running time.sleep1 if self.running for kid, proc in self.processes.iteritems if proc.poll is not None  process ended self.startchildkid codepre  pSo what happens is emwatchdog.startem launches all 7 processes, and if I send any process SIGTERM, it ends, and the monitor thread starts it again. However, if I then send the new process SIGTERM, it ignores it.p  pI should be able to keep sending kill 15  to the restarted processes over and over again. Why do they ignore it after being restartedp
Negative 854 pI am running a service that does some computation and communicates with an ms sql server every minute or so 247, uptime is very important and writes to error log if anything funny happens like a timeout or lost connection.p  pThis works great, however once in a while I will get this errorp  blockquote   pArithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.p blockquote  pSince this is run on clients side, and the exception has only occurred 3 times since the project has been launched a couple of months now this would be extremely hard to catch and debug. p  pI am using OleDbDataAdapter to communicate with the server.

I have developed a web site which uses session to track user specific information to determine whether a specific user has permission to access some part of the web site. I am using VSTS 2008  .Net 3.5  C to develop ASP.Net web site.p  pIn my design, when I access a hrefhttpmysitesitemanager relnofollowhttpmysitesitemanagera, if no session ID is available, users will be asked to input their user name and password if passed password checking, available session ID will be granted if session ID is available, it means user has site management permission and authenticated, then all the functions from site manager should be accessible by the user  i.e. all login user has permission to access site manager.p  pThe trouble scenario is like this, 1 I access a hrefhttpmysitesitemanager relnofollowhttpmysitesitemanagera from a new IE window, since I have not login before, and I will login using my credential and granted site management permission, 2 then I not closing IE enter a hrefhttpwww.google.com relnofollowhttpwww.google.coma into the address bar of the same IE window to replace a hrefhttpmysitesitemanager relnofollowhttpmysitesitemanagera, Google apprears, 3 then I paste address a hrefhttpmysitesitemanager relnofollowhttpmysitesitemanagera into the same IE window to access, I am surprised I am not asking for permission to input password.p  pAny ideas what is wrong What I want is in step 3 user should be asked to input password.p  pthanks in advance, Georgep

Negative 854 pI am writing a train based game in Facebook Javascript. I have an inverted triangle that represents the train and dashed lines that represent track which connects cities in Europe. The train moves along the track to travel from one city to the next. At this time, I redraw the gameboard with every page refresh. This has the effect of always showing the train in its latest position on the track. However, using page refresh to redraw the gameboard is turning out to be too CPU intensive and my apps performance is suffering as a result. Hence I need to implement Ajax and some kind of sprite animation for the train. p  pWhen the train changes position on the track, I need to erase the train marker at its old position, and redraw it at its new position. I know how to redraw it, but erasing it at its old position and restoring the background graphics is where I need help. I have no idea how to do this. As a matter of fact, I have no knowledge of manipulating graphics in javascript at all except a basic PlotPixel routine that creates 1px divs Please bear in mind that Facebook JS is incompatible with exisiting JS libraries and frameworks. p  pCan anyone offer me some help with this I would very much appreciate it.

Negative 854 pMy companys product is, at its core, a framework for developing metadatadriven UIs.  I dont know how to characterize it less succinctly than that, and hope I wont need to for purposes of this question, but well see.p  pIve been trying to come up to speed on WPF, and have been building UI prototypes here and there, and recently I decided to see if I could use Expression Blend to help with the design of these UIs.  And Im pretty mystified at this point.  p  pIt appears to me as though Expresssion Blend is designed with the expectation that you already know all of the objects that are going to be present in the UI at design time.  But our program generates these object dynamically at runtime.  p  pFor instance, a data row might be presented in a horizontal StackPanel containing alternating TextBlocks for captions and TextBoxes for data fields.  The number of these objects depends on metadata about the number of columns in the data row.  I can, pretty readily, write code that runs through a metadata record and populates a StackPanel dynamically, setting up the binding of all of the controls to properties in either the data or metadata.  A TextBoxs Width might be bound to metadata, while its Text is bound to data.p  pBut I cant even begin to figure out how to do something like this in Expression Blend.  I can manually create all these controls, so that I have a set of controls that I can apply styles to and work out the visual design of the app, but its really a pain to do this.  p  pI can write code that goes through my data model and emits XAML for all these controls, I suppose, and then copy and paste it.  But Im going to feel really stupid if it turns out there a way to do this sort of thing in Expression Blend and Ive dropped back and punted because Im too dim to figure out the right way to think of it.p  pIs this enough information for someone to try formulating an answerp

Negative 854 pI have to do queries on uncommitted changes and I tried to use transactions, but I found that it do not work if there are exceptions.p  pI made a simple example to reproduce the problem. I have a database with only one table called Tabella and the table has two fields ID is a autogenerated integer, and Valore is an integer with a Unique constraint. Then I try to run this codep  precodeusing TransactionScope scope  new TransactionScope      Db1Container db1  new Db1Container      try              db1.AddToTabellanew Tabella                      Valore  1                  db1.SaveChanges          catch        try              db1.AddToTabellanew Tabella                      Valore  1                  db1.SaveChanges Unique constraint is violated here and an exception is thrown          catch        try              db1.AddToTabellanew Tabella                      Valore  2                  db1.SaveChanges          catch        scope.Complete NEVER called    here everything should be rolled back codepre  pNow if I look into the database it should contain no records because the transaction should rollback, instead I find two records One with Valore1 and one with Valore2. I am missing something It looks like the second call to SaveChanges method rollback its own changes and deletes the transaction, then the third call to SaveChanges commits the changes of the first and the third insert at this point it is like the transaction not exists.p  pI also tried to use SaveChangesfalse method even without calling AcceptAllChanges method, but with no success I have the same behaviour.p  pI do not want the transaction to be rolled back automatically by SaveChanges, because I want to correct the errors for example by user interaction in the catch statement and make a retry.p  pCan someone help me with this It seems like a bug, and it is giving me a really big headache...p

Negative 854 pI have a list of items that have a a hrefhttpmathworld.wolfram.comPartialOrder.htmlpartial order relationa, i. e, the list can be considered a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPartially5Fordered5Fsetpartially ordered seta. I want to sort this list in the same way as in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions480640questiona. As correctly answered there, this is known as a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTopological5Fsortingtopological sortinga.p  pTheres a reasonably simple known algorithm to solve the problem. I want a LINQlike implementation of it.p  pI already tried to use codeOrderBycode extension method, but Im quite sure its not able to make topological sorting. The problem is that the codeIComparerltTKeygtcode interface is not able to represent a partial order. This happens because the codeComparecode method can return basically 3 kinds of values strongzerostrong, strongnegativestrong, and strongpositivestrong, meaning  strongareequalstrong, strongislessthanstrong, and strongisgreaterthenstrong, respectively. A working solution would only be possible if there were a way to return strongareunrelatedstrong.p  pFrom my biased point of view, the answer Im looking for might be composed by an codeIPartialOrderComparerltTgtcode interface and an extension method like thisp  precodepublic static IOrderedEnumerableltTSourcegt OrderByltTSource, TKeygt     this IEnumerableltTSourcegt source,     FuncltTSource, TKeygt keySelector,     IPartialOrderComparerltTKeygt comparer  codepre  pHow would this be implemented How does the codeIPartialOrderComparerltTgtcode interface would look like Would you recommend a different approach Im eager to see it. Maybe theres a nicer way to represent the partial order, I dont know.p
Negative 854 pI keep having problems deciding how I should create my classes internally. Initially I would have an external class handle all the variable management p  precodeString destination  car.setDestinationSan Fransisco int totalGas  car.getAmountOfGas int requiredGas  car.gasRequiredForDestinationdestination boolean enough  car.hasEnoughGastotalGas, destination if enough     car.travelToDestination codepre  pBut it seemed really strange to me that another class should be doing all the work for the car classs data, since the car should be able to do most of the work itself. So to fix that I thought... hmmm let me just stick all this in the class where it seems like it should go. I figured by doing this I could avoid having to pass so much data back and forth between methods. So then I got thisp  precodeClass Car    String location  home   String destination   int totalGas  0   int requiredGas  0   boolean enoughGas  false    public Car String destination, int totalGas      this.destination  destination     this.totalGas  totalGas      public boolean travelToDestination       getGasRequiredForDestination      hasEnoughGas      if enoughGas  true         location  destination    codepre  pSo the problem I encountered here is that now yes I dont have to pass the data around and things look real clean, but now I am dependent upon each function to return the value to the instance variable. Which in itself isnt terrible, but this just seems very wrong to me. At the same time I think to myself well I doesnt make sense to pass all this data from one place to another when it seems like I should just manipulate the instance variables. On the other hand my programs end up having 6 lines in a row of p  precodemyMethod    doThis   doThat   checkThis   checkTheOtherThing  codepre  pI never really see things done this way in real life so Im trying to figure basically A if this is wrong B if so when should we stick information in instance variables rather than pass it all around. Object Orientation allows us to do this but I dont know if its a good thing. C Are there any OO principles involved in doing or not doing things this way Maybe something Im violating that Im not aware of p  pIve been programming OO for a long time but I tend to have issues like this on and off so I was hoping to sort it out. If there are any book recommendations that deal with the trickier side of OO Id be interested in that too.p  pEDIT I should have said right off that this is a made up example so there are things in the real world I probably would not do this way necessarily. But I needed some sort of example as the code I had was too complicated.p

Negative 854 pAs my first WPF project, I am attempting to build an application to play a card game similar to Magic the Gathering.  It is not clear to me how to lay out the main play area.  You can see some examples that are similar to what I am attempting by looking at a hrefhttpwww.magicworkstation.comimagesmwsplay.gifexample 1a or a hrefhttpwww.wizards.commtgimagesdigitalmtgohowdoiplayplaygamescene.jpgexample 2a.  The chatinfo areas on the right would be separate user controls.p  pThe cards must maintain their aspect ratios, and each play area would start with 10 columns and two rows of cards.  As more cards are played, the number of columns andor rows may change.  Each player area may have a different number of columns andor rows.  Cards may overlap, and may be placed sideways tapped.  Cards in all areas should be the same size although they may be cropped in some areas.  Cards do not need to lie exactly on the grid they do not necessarily snaptogrid.p  pWhen the user hovers the mouse over a card, it should expand to a significantly larger size using an animation.  A card in one player area may overflow into the other players area when expanded but only as long as the mouse hovers.p  pGiven these requirements, I am tempted to use one large user control derived from Canvas with image objects for each card along with other shapes to delineate the areas.  This implies that I will be doing a lot of work during the OnRenderSizeChanged event to position the child items within the canvas manual layout.p  pUsing a grid does not seem feasible to me, due to the freeform placement and overlap.p  pDecomposing the play area into smaller user controls would leverage the WPF layout capabilities, but it seems like decomposition would prevent the cards from expanding into adjacent user controls during the mouseover, so that doesnt seem feasible either.p  pIs there a better alternative to one large canvasbased control  It seems wrong to be doing manual layout in WPF, but I cannot see an alternative.p

Negative 854 pIm writing an caching app that consumes large amounts of memory.p  pHopefully, Ill manage my memory well enough, but Im just thinking about what  to do if I do run out of memory.p  pIf a call to allocate even a simple object fails, is it likely that even a syslog call will also failp  pEDIT Ok perhaps I should clarify the question.  If malloc or new returns a NULL or 0L value then it essentially means the call failed and it cant give you the memory for some reason.  So, what would be the sensible thing to do in that casep  pEDIT2 Ive just realised that a call to new can throw an exception.  This could be caught at a higher level so I can perhaps gracefully exit further up.  At that point, it may even be possible to recover depending on how much memory is freed.  In the least I should by that point hopefully be able to log something.  So while I have seen code that checks the value of a pointer after new, it is unnecessary.  While in C, you should check the return value for malloc.p

This is just a quick utility program thats going to always run just on this local network.p  pstrongEditstrong Sorry if I was unclear.  I want the SqlConnection.Open to fail more quickly.

Negative 854 pId like to validate a Spring 3 MVC form. When an element is invalid, I want to redisplay the form with a validation message. This is pretty simple so far.

This means I need to do a redirect from the form POST submission to redisplay the form with validation messages the form is submitted via a POST.p  pIm thinking the best way to do this is to use SessionAttributeStore.retrieveAttribute to test if the form is already in the users session.

Negative 854 pAs of late, I have been pondering heavily about the best way to Mock a static method that is called from a class that I am trying to test.  Take the following code for examplep  precodeusing FileStream fStream  File.CreateCtest.txt      string text  MyUtilities.GetFormattedTexthello world     MyUtilities.WriteTextToFiletext, fStream  codepre  pI understand that this is a rather bad example, but it has three static method calls that are all different slightly. The File.Create function access the file system and I dont own that function.  The MyUtilities.GetFormattedText is a function that I own and it is purely stateless. Finally, the MyUtilities.WriteTextToFile is a function I own and it accesses the file system.p  pWhat I have been pondering lately is if this were legacy code, how could I refactor it to make it more unittestable.  I have heard several arguments that static functions should not be used because they are hard to test.  I disagree with this idea because static functions are useful and I dont think that a useful tool should be discarded just because the test framework that is being used cant handle it very well.p  pAfter much searching and deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that there are basically strong4 patterns or practicesstrong that can be used in order to make functions that call static functions unittestable.  These include the followingp  ol libDont mockb the static function at all and just let the unit test call it.li liWrap the static method in an instance class that implements an interface with the function that you need on it and then use dependency injection to use it in your class. Ill refer to this as binterface dependency injectionb.li liUse bMolesb or TypeMock to hijack the function call.li liUse dependeny injection for the function. Ill refer to this as bfunction dependency injectionb.li ol  pIve heard quite a lot of discussion about the first three practices, but as I was thinking about solutions to this problem, the forth idea came to me of strongfunction dependency injectionstrong.  This is similar to hiding a static function behind an interface, but without actually needing to create an interface and wrapper class.  An example of this would be the followingp  precodepublic class MyInstanceClass      private Actionltstring, FileStreamgt writeFunction  delegate        public MyInstanceClassActionltstring, FileStreamgt functionDependency              writeFunction  functionDependency           public void DoSomething2              using FileStream fStream  File.CreateCtest.txt                      string text  MyUtilities.GetFormattedTexthello world             writeFunctiontext, fStream                codepre  pSometimes, creating an interface and wrapper class for a static function call can be cumbersome and it can pollute your solution with a lot of small classes whose sole purpose is to call a static function.  I am all for writing code that is easily testable, but this practice seems to be a workaround for a bad testing framework.p  pAs I was thinking about these different solutions, I came to an understanding that all of the 4 practices mentioned above can be applied in different situations. Here is what I am thinking is the strongcorrect cicumstances to apply the above practicesstrongp  ol libDont mockb the static function if it is purely stateless and does not access system resources such as the filesystem or a database. Of course, the argument can be made that if system resources are being accessed then this introduces state into the static function anyway.li liUse binterface dependency injectionb when there are several static functions that you are using that can all logically be added to a single interface. The key here is that there are several static functions being used.  I think that in most cases this will not be the case.  There will probably only be one or two static functions being called in a function.li liUse bMolesb when you are mocking up external libraries such as UI libraries or database libraries such as linq to sql.  My opinion is that if Moles or TypeMock is used to hijack the CLR in order to mock your own code, then this is an indicator that some refactoring needs to be done to decouple the objects.li liUse bfunction dependency injectionb when there is a small number of static function calls in the code that is being tested.  This is the pattern that I am leaning towards in most cases in order to test functions that are calling static functions in my own utility classes.li ol  pThese are my thoughts, but I would really appreciate some feedback on this.  What is the best way to test code where an external static function is being calledp

Negative 854 pIm working through a learning project around Core Data on OS X. I have an entity Foo in the data store, and in the UI, I use an NSArrayController with bindings to put some name field of the Foo objects into an NSTableView, where the user can adddeleterename and potentially reorder the items.p  pAs you know, Core Data storage is unordered. However, Id like to give it order from the user standpoint. E.g. adding a new row to the table view fixes that new Foo to the end of the list, etc. If the table allows reordering, that order is maintained.p  pI assume that I should accomplish this by adding some hidden ie the user never encounters it ordinal field to the Foo entity, which is fine. Im trying to figure outp  ol liWhere is the right place to set this ordinal field for new items Right now, a button is invoking the codeaddcode action on the array controller and bindings handles all the rest magically. Ill need access to the count of items to set it correctly.li liWhere is the right place to fixup the whole result sets ordinals on delete or reorderli liAssuming all objects in the store have a reasonable ordinal attribute, what must I do to the UI connections to get the table view to display the results sorted by that ordinal Is this something I can do purely with bindings Do I need to subclass... something li ol  pIt feels like this is a common enough scenario that people here might have a ready answer. Im new to Core Data and bindings trying to grope my way around. Dont need code pointers in the right direction would be great. Thanks.p

Negative 854 pIm trying to make a website with a blogand some more website features and forum in it. And I have decided to use Drupal for the blog and SMF for the forumfor I have no confidence on Drupal7s forum yet.p  pMy question is, can I use the same user account that I created in SMF with Drupal Say I created an account in the forumSMF then I will automatically get an account in the blogdrupal. Is it possible Im thinking of using a single table for the user, but I would have to choose between the two databases, which I think is very difficult.p  pThanks.p
Negative 854 pI have a situation in ASP.NET MVC 2 where I have a form whose fields are based on info supplied by a view model, but whose posted data is a subset of that data represented by a slimmer edit model.  Id like to add simple data annotation validation to the edit model, but since the view is based on the view model, Im not sure how to proceed.p
Negative 854 pOk, This is a pretty basic question im sure but im new to PHP and havent been able to figure it out. The input string is data im trying to continue to pull and only use the first match. Is the below incorrect This may not even be the best way to perform the action, im just trying to pull the contents in between two html tags first set found and discard the rest of the data. I know there are similar questions, ive read them all, my question is a mix, if theres a better way to do this and how i can define the match as the new input for the rest of the remaining code. If i change matches to data2 and use it from there on out it returns errors.p  precodepregmatchlth2gt.lth2gts, data, matches codepre

Negative 854 pI am using codesharedptrcode as my garbage collection for a toy language that I am working on which compiles to C. My objects derive from a common base class above that there are strings and numbers then there are vectors and maps.  Everything on the c side is passed wrapped in codesharedptrcodes so my containers actually hold codesharedptrcode so that when they get destroyed their content is destroyed too.  This scheme works but it feels a bit weird in that containers that are base objects are holding codesharedptrcodes.  Is there a flaw with my design  If yes what would be an alternative hierarchy around this approachp
Negative 854 pIm trying to use the prototype version of the openid selector found in openidselector1.3.zip, downloaded from Google Code 2011May03, with djangoopenidauthp  pIve turned off demo mode in the javascript code.p  pThe combination works with a launchpad.net openid but not with Google or Yahoo.p  pWhen I click Google or Yahoo, nothing happens The button for google or yahoo renders as sunken.  Thats it.  Also the django devserver never shows a form POST when clicking the Google or Yahoo buttons.p  pWhen pressing AOL a text field and a submit button is added to the form.... but this does not happen when pressing Google or Yahoo... no extra field and no signinsubmit button.p  pI suspect a javascript error or a problem with naming or iding the elements.  My hope is that someone who has done this before can quickly see the problem looking at how the form is set up in the template below.  p  pThe browsers tested were Firefox 3.6.16 linux, and google chrome linux.  They seem to function comparably, both will login the launchpad openid but do nothing beyond sinking the identifier button when google or yahoo is clicked. p  pHeres the django dev webserver log, showing that all the static pieces are being loaded. These are copied from the openidselector distribution at code.google.com with only a couple of minor changes turn off demo, set image directory. This is to show that the right pieces are being delivered of course, these could also be cached so absence would not be conclusive...p  precode[03May2011 045853] GET  HTTP1.1 200 115 [03May2011 045856] GET openidlogin HTTP1.1 301 0 [03May2011 045856] GET openidlogin HTTP1.1 200 2182 [03May2011 045856] GET staticcssopenid.css HTTP1.1 200 1007 [03May2011 045856] GET staticjsprototype.js HTTP1.1 200 162353 [03May2011 045856] GET staticjsopenidprototype.js HTTP1.1 200 5931 [03May2011 045856] GET staticjsopeniden.js HTTP1.1 200 2302 [03May2011 045856] GET staticimagesopenidprovidersen.png HTTP1.1 200 15894 codepre  pdjangoopenidauth only provides a text entrysubmit button form as an example.

Could those of you more experience share your thoughts on what I think I am meant to do nextp  ul lipI initially thought a Submission hasmany Reviewers. But it seems it should actually be the other way around  Reviewer is assigned many Submissions. To illustrate, its a bit like giving individual Reviewers permission to comment on specific posts. Is this a normal hasmany relationship Ive been reading a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgassociationbasics.html relnofollowhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgassociationbasics.htmla and it seems like it could also be a hasandbelongstomany.pli lipEach Version has many Reviews, therefore Version hasmany Reviews and Review belongsto Version.pli lipAdditionally, I guess Review should have some reviewerid kind if field so we know who wrote it. This should be a Review hasone Reviewer.pli ul  pAs an aside, I dont want to be too needy, but it would be absolutely fantastic if someone could provide some insight into the few lines of Reviewer controller code necessary for an admin to assign himher to a Submission.p  pCheers,p

Negative 854 pI am in the process of migrating a large scale web service to be compatible with international characters.  It is a TomcatSpring MVCSQL Server stack.  The migration itself was relatively straight forward, we made a few settings changes in Tomcat to force default use of UTF8 in the response, changed some Java code to use the encoding and migated a few VARCHAR columns to NVARCHAR followed by a healthy dose of unitfunctional tests.p  pAnother person on my team wants a load test now to make sure none of the changes adversely affect the system performance.  The individual components of this transition described above dont really hint at any performance changes and, frankly, I dont think its completely necessary based on my limited knowledge. I plan to do it anyway, but my question, then, is this  are there any performance gotchas one might see in such a migration  Is there anything specific to a different character encoding that might change the performance of a system p  pThe only thing I could think of would be heavy string comparison and sorting, etc. Any ideasp
Negative 854 pA member of my Team is writing an application that accesses an external FTP site to download files. Having written the code we would like to be able to do integration testing without using a physical ftp server as it is an external site.p  pWe have done similar things in the past using a hrefhttpndumbster.sourceforge.netdefault.htmlnDumpstera for simulating an smtp server in code and we are wondering strongemif there are any equilivent compliant ftp servers that can be usedemstrongp  pEditp  pI should add that these are not for true unit tests, we have those and mock our ftp implementation. p  pHowever we are using WebFtpRequest.Create in the actual implementation of the interface. So testing this code requires an actual server unless we register our own protocol in the tests eventually we will have to test against an actual server. p  pWe want to be able to start and stop the ftp server in code much like you can nDumpster and examine that our calls are correct. p

Negative 854 pI have a function codevoid AddEntityEntity addtolistcode that pushes elements back onto a codevectorcode but since the size and capacity are equal when the element is added to the codevectorcode, the vector reallocates and the codeiteratorcode becomes invalid.p  pThen when I try to increment the iterator I get a crash because of the invalid iterator, since codepushback...code doesnt return a iterator to the reallocated memory I was wondering how to get around this problem.p  pShould I just use codeinsert...code since it does return an codeiteratorcode, or should I use a pointer that stores the reference to the vector after its reallocated and then have the codeiteratorcode equal the pointer that points to the reallocated codevectorcodep

Negative 854 pSay I have a bunch of code for all controls, yet I need subclasses that interact with my software suite to use those common methods.

Negative 854 pBeen playing with the thought of javascript game. Especially RTS types... the question is as followed.p  pHow do i work on creating a draggable inner frame, similar to google mapsp  pThe idea, is that there is an overlaying UI, and a much larger draggable map underneath. Sort of similar to your usual RTS games. However i been trying to figure a simple work around for such an interface. Is there a ready made API for something similar, or would i need to do it from scratch.p  pIf possible, it should work on an iphone too Xp  pemAdditional infoem From what i know so far, it seems like google maps uses a draggable element placed ontop of the map, detecting the drag events. What i dun understand however, is how, it is still able to hit objects beneath it... p

Negative 854 pIn my work I need to move some existing Enterprise Java applications to AWS. I have gone through many pages on aws.amazon.com and also googled enough. Also, I have tried to go through all the related questions at stackoverflow. All these things made many things clear, however, I am still having some confusion. Here is our application structurep  ol liIt is a Spring based application which uses Spring MVC as its presentation layer and plain Java Interfaces and Classes for handling business and data logic.li liMySQL is used for persistence.li ol  pSo, the application architecture is simple enough. However, the catch is that we need to deploy many instances of this application. This count is currently 15 and can go beyond 30. One more point is that all these instances share a common database.p  pNow here is what we need to achieve by moving to AWSp  ol liHigher fault tolerance for the application. Recently we faced a serverpower failure in dedicated hosting causing some hours of down time.li liHigher performance for all instance of the application in terms of response time and throughput.li liHigher fault tolerance for MySQL.

The whole file system on the hard drive went read only causing malfunctioning of the application instances hosted on that server.li liObviously reducing the total cost and overhead of infrastructure management.li ol  pAs far as I am able to understand AWS infrastructure till now, here is what we would need in AWS for our setupp  ol li4 instances, each hosting about 10 application instances, of some EBS based LINUX AMI with Tomcat and MySQL installed on that.li liI am guessing that we would also need 1 instance for fault tolerance for each of those 4 instances totaling 8 instance in all.li liAll of the server instances would have about 160GB of EBS.li li4 Elastic IPsli li4 Elastic Load Balancersli liOther stuff like snapshot etcli ol  pNow here are my questionsp  ol lipDo I really need to have that extra server instancefor fault tolerance for each main server instance, considering the face that EBS are automatically backed up by AWS and they would provide new EBS with same data in case of hardware failurepli lipHow would I share database among all server instances 4x2 in above scenario One option I am seeing is to implement MySQL clustering among those server instance. Lets say, the MySQL cluster would contain 1 Management Node, 3 SQL nodes and 4 Data Nodes. However, in this case maintaining the cluster would be an additional overhead for us and this may not be accepted as we would like get rid of infrastructure management.pli lipDo I need to have RDS instead for database and remove MySQL instances from all server isntances 4x2 If yes, would I need to buy RDS instances in addition to EC2 instances I think, if I need to buy separate instances for RDS then cost of total infrastructure would increase at least by 75. or the RDS instances also gives compute units for application development thus reducing the total number of instances for application deploymentpli lipIn case of RDS implementation, does one really need EBS based EC2 instances If we can some how remove EBS requirement from EC2 instances with RDS instances in place, we can reduce the total cost.pli ol  pAny help would be appreciated and please let me know if I am not clear to specify my problem and need more clarification for any point.p

Negative 854 pI have a UITabBarController.  One tab is a UINavigationController where its rootViewController is a subclass of UIViewController.  In my rootViewController, in my viewDidLoad, I push the first of three ViewControllers.  Based on which UISegmentedControl is pressed, I pop the old view, and I push the viewController that corresponds to the UISegmentedControl.  This works for the most part.  p  pThe problem is if Im currently in the Navigation hierarchy, if I hit the same tab again the tab I am already looking at, it pops the current ViewController off the stack and returns to the rootViewController.  Im not sure why this is happening.  I only have one place where I popViewController and I set a break point there, and it never gets called.  So my assumption is that when I select the tab of the UITabBarController when Im already on that tab, it returns to the rootViewController.  Is that correct  Is there anything I can do to fix this issue  Thanks.p

Negative 854 pI converted my app to ARC and noticed that an object alloced in one of my view controllers was not being dealloced when that view controller was dealloced. It took a while to figure out why. I have Enable Zombie Objects on for my project while debugging and this turned out to be the cause. Consider the following app logicp  p1 Users invokes action in codeRootViewControllercode that causes a codeSecondaryViewControllercode to be created and presented via codepresentModalViewControlleranimatedcode.p  p2 codeSecondaryViewControllercode contains an codeActionsControllercode that is an codeNSObjectcode subclass.p  p3 codeActionsControllercode observes a notification via codeNSNotificationCentercode when it is initialized and stops observing when it is dealloced.p  p4 User dismisses codeSecondaryViewControllercode to return to codeRootViewControllercode.p  pWith Enable Zombie Objects turned off, the above works fine, all objects are deallocated. With Enable Zombie Objects on codeActionsControllercode is not deallocated even though codeSecondaryViewControllercode is deallocated.p  pThis caused problems in my app bc codeNSNotificationCentercode continues to send notifications to codeActionsControllercode and the resulting handlers cause the app to crash.p  pI created a simple app illustrating this at a hrefhttpsgithub.comxjonesXJARCTestApphttpsgithub.comxjonesXJARCTestAppa. Look at the console log with Enable Zombie Objects onoff to verify this.p  pstrongQUESTIONSstrongp  ol liIs this correct behavior of Enable Zombie Objectsli liHow should I implement this type of logic to eliminate the issue. I would like to continue using Enable Zombie Objects.li ol  pstrongEDIT 1 per Kevins suggestion Ive submitted this to Apple and openradar at a hrefhttpopenradar.appspot.com10537635httpopenradar.appspot.com10537635a.strongp  pstrongEDIT 2 clarification on a good answerstrongp  pFirst, Im an experienced iOS developer and I fully understand ARC, zombie objects, etc. If Im missing something, of course, I appreciate any illumination.p  pSecond, it is true that a workaround for this specific crash is to remove codeactionsControllercode as an observer when codesecondaryViewControllercode is deallocated. I have also found that if I explicitly set codeactionsController  nilcode when codesecondaryViewControllercode is dealloced it will be dealloced. Both of these are not great workaround bc they effectively require you to use ARC but code as if you are not using ARC e.g. nil iVars explicitly in dealloc. A specific solution also doesnt help identify when this would be an issue in other controllers so developers know deterministically whenhow to workaround this issue.p  pA good answer would explain how to deterministically know that you need to do something special wrt an object when using ARC  NSZombieEnabled so it would solve this specific example and also apply generally to a project as a whole wo leaving the potential for other similar problems.p  pIt is entirely possible that a good answer doesnt exist as this may be a bug in XCode.p  pthanks allp

Negative 854 pFirst, let me just mention that this is my first attempt at a fromthegroundup jQuery plugin.p  pFor starters, I want my plugin to accept user defined options parms via an object. For examplep  precodeltscriptgt     document.readyfunction          .myClass.augaetrk             myobja  zeroobj00 zero,oneobj01 one,twoobj02 two,             myobjb  zeroobj10 aaa,oneobj11 bbb                ltscriptgt codepre  pNote The names of those objects will not be predefined. They will be at the discretion of the developer using the plugin.p  pTo cut a long story short, within the plugin I parse for example a links CSS classes to identify which user parms object I should be using further into the plugin. For example.p  precodelta classotherclass1 thismyobja otherclass2 hrefhttpmylink.comgtsome linkltagt codepre  pI can get the class  in this case thismyobja and the name of the object I need, myobja. What I cant seem figure out is how to use that stringvalue as the name of the object whose parm values I want to accessutilize. p  pAt the moment, Im eaching through the options and using a simple if to get to the object I want. It works but I would think Im adding a lot of unnecessary overhead. In PHP I would use a  but I cant seem to find that equivalent in jQuery. p  pHow can I take the value Im getting from parsing the links class and then use the value to get corresponding user options p  pIf youre able to help empleaseem type slow and assume I know even less than you think I might know. While probably a slightly advanced programming concept, Im by no means an advanced  or even average  jQuery developer. Im sure youre busy but if you give an answerexample please keep in mind Im trying to learn so a bit of explanation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. p

This is particularly important to ensure fast page  loads for users and SEO robots.      Synchronous Loading          It is possible to load the SDK synchronously which may be useful for  debugging, but this method is not recommended for typical use. Synchronous operations will block the web page, resulting in worse performance and a  slower user experience.

Negative 854 pTheres a cool library I found for voting on things  a hrefhttpsgithub.combrady8thumbsup relnofollowhttpsgithub.combrady8thumbsupap  pId like to be able to modify it myself or with someones help to add weight based on time. Business logic wise, I have an idea of how to do it, but could use some guidance on how to implement it.p  pMy reasoning for this is that unless you add weight based on time, then old entries with the most votes will always be at the top of a tally query. It makes sense to have newer entries have more weight so they have the ability to surface.p  pThoughts Perhaps theres a library that already does thisp

Negative 854 pIm building an application that should query Google search very often. But im having trouble choosing which API i should use. There are so many of them  AJAX, REST, Web, SOAP, Custom and maybe something else. Some of them are deprecated now. From that list, from what i understand, only AJAX and Custom Search API are not. Custom Search API has 100 requests per day limit. Very small amount. I couldnt find any published limits for AJAX API, but it looks like i can do only 20 requests per hour or so. Also not so good.p  pSo, which API should i use in desktop application to get as much as possible And second question what else i can do to increase the limit Maybe set appropriate http headers, use API key or something else p

The div with the class firstpic is IN the div with the class fade. Both are containing one imgelement. The div with class firstpic is by default not visible see CSS, so that it can be faded in. Fading it in is triggered by pressing a button see the Javascript. But instead of nicely fading in, it fades in with a black background. I think it could be because of the imgElement. When I use two divs with cssbackground images, it fades nicely. But I need imgElements, since I need to resize the pictures. Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 854 pWhat is the best way regarding database design for storing images for different purposesp  pI have a bunch of user photos and I got another 5 different sets of photos like user photos but with no connection to user photos.p  pIs the best thing to store all photos in a single database table and try to reference them from within that table, or is the best to create different tables for each set of photosp  pI can see one benefit from creating multiple tables and thats the cascade delete function for removing the photo when the main object is deleted.p  pAny other aspects to considerp  pAnother example could be addresses. A user can have an address but so can a company or a location.  Create one table for all addresses and try to have some sort of index tables to reference what address belongs to what object or have different tables and eliminate the problem.p

Negative 854 pI have an application, which periodically takes checkpoints each 1 or 2 seconds. The checkpoint is taken by using codeforkcode. For some reason, I also need to note down pages which have been modified since the last checkpoint. The most efficient way that comes to my mind is that we can note down the pages whenever there is a page fault due to copyonwrite mechanism used in fork, where initially immediately after fork the same physical pages are mapped to the original and forked process, but when the original process tries to write to a page, a new physical page is mapped for that page address. p  pI think, I will need to make modifications in the kernel to do this, or can this be done in user space, by using some signal handler At this moment what I was doing was to make all pages used by the application read only after taking a checkpoint, and trap the faults by using a signal handler when pages are written to note down their addresses. However, this is inefficient as compared to noting down pages on copyonwrite. How can I achieve that. What part of kernel do I need to modify Can someone provide me the link to that part of the code where I need to make the modifications And also can someone advise me if this can be done in userspace with the same or nearly same efficiencyp

Negative 854 pOur company website features a random shard generator, built in Flash, which creates a number of overlapping coloured shard graphics at random just below the site header.p  pa hrefhttpwww.clarendonmarketing.com relnofollowhttpwww.clarendonmarketing.comap  pI am trying to replicate this effect using HTML5, and whilst I can generate the random shards easily enough, the blended overlapping multiply in Adobe terms is proving a challenge.p  pI have a solution which basically creates an array of all the canvass pixel data before each shard is drawn, then another array with the canvass pixel data after each shard is drawn.  It then compares the two and where it finds a non transparent pixel in the first array whose corresponding pixel in the second array matches the currently selected fill colour, it redraws it with a new colour value determined by a multiply function topValue  bottomValue  255.p  pGenerally this works fine and achieves the desired effect, EXCEPT around the edges of the overlapping shards, where a jagged effect is produced.p  pI believe this has something to do with the browsers antialiasing.

Negative 854 pWe are building a tool for average case runtime analysis of Java Byte Code programs. One part of this is measuring real runtimes. So we would take an arbitrary, user provided method that may or may not have a result and may or may not have side effects examples include Quicksort, factorial, dummy nested loops, ... and execute it using reflection, measuring the elapsed time. Whether or not we benchmark properly at all is besides the point here.p  pIn the benchmarking code, we obviously dont do anything with the result and some methods wont even have results. Therefore, there is no telling what the JIT may do, and we have in fact observed that it seems to optimise the whole benchmarked method call away on occasion. As the benchmarked methods are not used in isolation in reality, this renders the benchmark useless.p  pHow can we prevent JIT from doing that We dont want to turn it off completely because then benchmarking takes ages, and we want to benchmark real runtimes anyway so we want JIT to be active eminsideem the method.p  pI am aware of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4205308bestwayofstoppingjavaoptimisingawayamethodcallwhenperformancetestingthis questiona but the given scenario is too narrow we do not know the result type if there is one and can therefore not use the result in some fashion the JIT does not see as useless.p

Negative 854 pIm trying to use the css3 flexbox module in order to have table columns that can stretch, but still have a default width, as well as having a minwidth and maxwidth. p  pThis works well when the viewport is wide enough to hold the minimum widths for each column, but when the viewport shrinks, all the columns collapses.

Negative 854 pI am developing a web application with perrole user interface and functionality. In codeuserscode table I have a coderolecode column, an codeenumcode, which stores each users role. In the login script if a matching record for the userpass is found I set a codeSESSION[role]code variable to the value of the records role field. Along with the role, I also store several other bits of data, such as the displayname in other codeSESSIONcode variables. Then, codeSESSION[role]code is used throughout the application to send the correct user interface to the browser and enforce access rules.p  pThis all works fine on my localhost, but on the remote server, codeSESSION[role]code works just the first time  i.e. the correct user interface is sent to the browser. After that point, codeSESSION[role]code somehow changes to a different existing role, and as a result access rules do not allow the functions to be available. What is even more bizarre is that only codeSESSION[role]code changes and codeSESSION[displayname]code or codeSESSION[username]code remain intact.p  pI am not setting codeSESSIONcode variables anywhere other than codelogin.phpcode. Any ideas where I should look for potential causes is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 854 pI am having trouble searching against a MySQL database. The database collation is codeutf8generalcicode, with the table collation as codelatin1swedishcicode. My problem is thisp  pA user entry is stored as fake name for privacy codeTamp39quila Smithcode, with the real name being codeTquila Smithcode.p  pMy web application needs to be able to correctly search for that user by name, but with the name being searched as codeTquilacode, rather than codeTamp39quilacode. I have tried using codestudentname  strreplace, amp39, studentnamecode, which when tested with echo prints out codeTamp39quilacode like it should. However, the database cannot find this user in the database with that search. p  pCan anyone offer some assistance with this I have been at a loss to what could be doing this. I have looked into character sets which I think might be the issue, but I cant seem to get this working. Many thanks to whoever can help mep

Negative 854 pI am working on a project that requires the use of a tree data structure. Having done some researches I found that Java JTree would be of great use to my project, however I stumbled upon a problem that I spent a week fixing but to no avail.p  pHeres the problem, in order to create a new node, a DefaultMutableTreeNode has to be instantiated and Im not sure how that can be done in a loop. Normally when we want to create a new node in JTree, we would firstly declare the nodes in the following wayp  precodeDefaultMutableTreeNode parent  new DefaultMutableTreeNodeThis is parent node. DefaultMutableTreeNode child  new DefaultMutableTreeNodeThis is child node. codepre  pThen, in order to addlink child node to parent node, we would do the followingp  precodeparent.addchild codepre  pI have two arraylists containing the parent nodes and child nodes, they correspond to each other in a parentchild relationship, meaning that arraylistParent.getx will always be the parent of arraylistChild.getx.p  pI was thinking that by using a for loop, I could dop  precodefor int x  0 x lt arraylistParent.size x     parent.addnew DefaultMutableTreeNodearraylistChild.getx  codepre  pThis could only work in a flat hierarchy tree, which obviously isnt the case for me. I will have different parent nodes in arrayListParent which I need to check before adding the child nodes, but once again not all child nodes have the same, single parent node. My arraylists probably contain something like thisp  precodearraylistParent  [root, p1, p2, p2, p3, p1] arraylistChild  [p1, p2, p5, p3, p4, p5] codepre  pand I want to generate the tree structure like thisp  precoderoot   ..p1     ..p2       ..p5                 ..p3         ..p4     ..p5 codepre  pObviously I can throw a few if loops inside to check whether parent.getUserObject is the same as arraylistParent.getx but only those that match the string This is parent node will be checked and added.p  pIf theres a different, nonexistent parent found in the loop, a new parent needs to be created and this is the tricky part I dont know how to solve, as I have no idea how to have the loop automatically create a new instance of parent for the child node.p

Negative 854 pI know this is a popular question but I have looked at all of the other responses and none of them seem to work.  What I want to do is write some code to a text file. My first question is there a way to view that text file without writing code to the console  Second, I dont know where in my phone it goes and I want to see it to help trouble shoot, so if you know how to do that too, it would be great.  So now I will give you an overview of what is happening. When I start my program it checks to see if the file exists, if it doesnt it reads a file out of my assets folder and copies that info and sends it to a file into the sd card. If it exits it reads the info from the sd card. Next if I press a button and change numbers and print it to my sd card again then I close it using task managers then when I come back the original information is here. I dont feel like it is being able to find  my sd card location.

Negative 854 pSo, after learning about completion blocks a while back, I like using completion blocks a lot.  I like closure and I like the ability to pass just about anything anywhere I want.p  pAs someone whos new to thread programming, Ive been staying away from GCD and NSOperationbut lately Ive had to program asynchronous updated to Core Data stuff and I am beginning to have doubts to my all completion block all the time approach.p  pSo heres one example of what Im questioning myself I have a series of potentially rather large data images, sound, video, what have you to upload to a server somewhere.  The metadata for these data is stored in Core Data, and I have a timestamp that I use to decide which objects should get uploaded.  All these uploads should be done sequentially.p  pWhat I have coded is a essentially basically just a function with a completion block in it, that has a call to itself at the end of the block, like thisp  precodevoiduploadAllAsynchronously    ...  First figure out what to upload based on core data    Here comes the completion block in question   voidblkBOOL  BOOLuploadSuccess      ...  if upload successful, update core data to mark what has been uploaded     [self uploadAllAsynchronously]  Recursively calls the function that contains this block.  I actually have a weak self, or if that fails to break a retain cycle, I should be able to pass in a NSManagedObjectContext as an argument.      [NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest... queue... completionHandlerblk]    codepre  pThis should work, right  Is there something here that is completely dangerous that suggests I have to use GCD and handling my own queue  I am asking this because Im kind of having some trouble right now possibly with data in it would appear different threads not updating correctly because of asynchronous calls, though not sure which part of my code is the culprit.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 854 pI have a web application project in VS2012 which Im publishing using a Web Deploy Package. I want this package to include apppool settings, specifically emcreatingem an IIS apppool and assigning the newly created application to it.p  pIm familiar with the option Include application pool settings used by this Web project available when the project is configured to use an IIS instance not IIS Express, but IIS configuration is strongnotstrong part of the project file, and thus not source controlled. What happens when somebody builds a deployment package on a machine that hasnt had IIS meticulously configured Not ideal.p  pHow else then, can I go about getting AppPool settings into my web deploy package I understand that the appPoolConfig provider is IIS7 only, Im fine with that limitation. Ive banged my head against this issue in the past and never found a solution. 18 months later, weve got a new VisualStudio version, and a new webpublishingpipeline, are there new options to address this Or maybe something I missed when I first tackled this problemp  pstrongEditstrongp  pOK, Im seeing the following as optionsp  ol liConfigure my project to sync settings from an IIS instance. As mentioned, Im not a fan of this given that it puts settings emoutsideem of the project, meaning the environment has to be meticulously configured to build  publish. Plus it drags along other IIS settings I dont want included.li liInject something into the webpublishingpipeline WPP to modify the archive.xml. Ive toyed with this in the past and had limited success. One problem is the pipeline isnt exactly cooperative with working directly on the archive.xml file, another problem is some of the more cryptic attributes involved, like codeMSDeploy.MSDeployProviderOptionscode which appears to have some Base64 encoded binary No idea what to put in there.li liFind an existing provider that can do what I want. I might be out of luck here, the codeappPoolConfigcode provider only seems to want to read  write IIS, not, say, an XML file of settings. Does anybody know otherwiseli liWrite my own provider to produce manifest output entries. Im not sure, is it possible to write a custom provider that writes to a manifest using the name of an existing provider As in, codeMyCustomPoolProvidercode writes codeappPoolConfigcode sections into a manifest This sounds like a potentially painful exercise that may or may not work. Would I still need to figure out the encoding of whatever is going into codeMSDeploy.MSDeployProviderOptionscodeli ol  pI get the feeling that the fundamental obstacle with Web Deploy for what Im trying to accomplish, is how strictly it leans on providers. The preexisting providers are largely designed for IIS synchronisation, strongnotstrong primary development and publication. It so happens that some of these providers can be emrelativelyem easily hooked into via MSBuild, but the majority insist on pulling data from IIS, and thats that.p

If not, I want to capture the constness in a boolean for further usage. p  pstrongEDITstrong as was pointed out DanielFrey, the constructor is not a good place to test for constness. What about a const member functionp  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong Thanks everyone for correcting my initially illposed question and providing the various parts of the answer constructors illdefined constness, rvaluedness of codethiscode, the contextual meaning of codeconstcode, the with hindsight obvious overload trick that I had overlooked, and the const reference aliasing loophole lurking in the shadows. For me this question was Stackoverflow at its best. I decided to select JonathanWakelys answer because it showed how to define codeMutablecode and codeImmutablecode classes that strengthen the constness concept to achieve what I want in a foolproof way.p

Either it is fixed looking at a specific location and standard wasd movement moves around that point, or it has freelook, where movement is not constrained to circling around a point and the mouse can be used to look anywhere. clamped to only be able to look straight updown though, as I dont want a six degrees of freedom camera a la Descent This means that I currently do not want to have roll.p  pCan someone walk me through the basics necessary to implement this kind of thing Im currently using LWJGL, so I have access to the Vector and Matrix classes they provide, as well as my own Quaternion class which does some stuff that LWJGL doesnt. Also assume that I have a method, lookAt, which is given coordinates exactly like OpenGLs gluLookAt eyex, eyey, ..., upy, upz, and this is where I wanted to build the matrixmatrices. Also assume the resultant matrixmatrices are going to be used in a version 330 shader wherep  precodelayoutlocation  0 in vec4 position uniform mat4 camera uniform mat4 projection uniform mat4 model  ... glPosition  projection  camera  model  position codepre  pis some of the code.

Negative 854 pI am trying to make a phone app for my universitys notice board. p  pThis is the a hrefhttpintranet.iiitbh.ac.in relnofollownotice boarda. And each notice is served as an a hrefhttphib.ximb.ac.inHibiscusPubnbDocDet.phpdocid3685ampclientiiit relnofollowHTML pagea. The URL structure of the notices are simple, with docid giving each notices ID. As far as I guessed from the pattern its an auto incrementing key.p  pMy strategy so far has been to get the HTML file from with a get request, by incrementing the docid value. Parse the html to get the desired values, e.g Title, Posted by, Attention, Date and body.p  pInitially to store the existing notices to the datastore, then a cron job can check for new notices.p  pThese sets of values will be served as JSON to the phone app.p  pThe body part of the notice is formatted using HTML tags. I would like to retain the formatting. I am simply storing the body as a string which contains all the html tags. Could this be a problem somehow Is there a better way to preserve the formattingp  pI have to do this because i have no way of knowing upfront what sort     of formatting is donep

Negative 854 pI am trying to process two forms in a Django class based view. The site contains a form called codeformcode based on codeGETcode for narrowing the list results of the ListView and the second form codestatusformcode based on codePOSTcode.p  pBoth forms are required since the ListView returns a list of items. codeFormcode lets the user restrict the choices and codestatusformscode lets the user flag incorrect items via a modal form therefore it needs to be in the same template. p  pMy trouble is that codeListViewcode does not come with the method codepostcode, however codeFormViewcode does.

Negative 854 pI started developing my first mobile app using jquery mobile.  So far it has been going nicely, but I am not able to solve a specific popup behaviour. p  pWhat I want it for a popup to show once the user loads the app. This popup should be similar to a add to home popup like you see in many apps. It is intended to point the users direction to the fixed footer with some important buttons. I managed to insert this popup and open it on page load, but there are two things I am not able to do.p  ol lipMy popup loads and disappears, which I want, and that is all OK.

Negative 854 pI have been trying to write an application for Android that will allow me to slow down and speed up music in real time. I came across the SoundTouch library, which even states that it can be used in Android via the jni. However, the source only converts the getversionString method to andorid. I have found several other implementations of this library, such as a hrefhttpsgithub.comnonameenternamesoundtouchandroid relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnonameenternamesoundtouchandroida, but it is missing a the crucial file, and thus will not compile. I have also tried porting a Desktop application, called Mypodconv a hrefhttpwww.aplu.chhomeapluhomex.jspsite44 relnofollowhttpwww.aplu.chhomeapluhomex.jspsite44a, to Android, but this uses the javax.sound package contained within rt.jar which is too big for android and thus causes a heap overflow and crashes eclipse. Does anybody know how I can make this library work in android Thanksp

Negative 854 pI just setup application tests with OCUnit for my iOS project and am trying to figure out what to do with authentication. My app has a forced login screen where the user is required to authenticate with Facebook prior to entering the main app. When the user decides to authenticate, it pops them into Safari, takes them through an authentication sequence that is managed by Facebook, and then brings them back into the app with further registration steps if they are a new user. p  pWhat Im trying to figure out is, how can I get an application test to get past the login screen p  pOne option Ive considered is making a new build configuration e.g. Test that adds a preprocessor macro e.g. TEST  1 that I can detect in my code.  Then, only for that test configuration, I could replace my regular login code with a FBTestSession that wouldnt require the app to pop out to Safari.

Negative 854 pIm working on a decently large Spring MVC app that continues to grow.  Its a traditional Spring MVC app with the views being JSP that renders the HTML which is returned to the browser.  The app uses a lot of javascript and jQuery plugins.  The javascript is scattered throughout the code and is getting harder to maintain.  Wed like to clean that up and move to a single page application.  Weve looked into Backbone.js and specifically Marionette.  A couple questions we havep  ol lipHow does Spring Security work with this  As I understand, instead of JSPs and HTML returned from the server it will be JSON through a RESTful API.  So when the user logs in with a usernamepassword do I need to generate an API key and send that down in a successful authentication response  Then from that point forward every API call would have that API key part of it to authenticate each callpli lipHave others found success moving a traditional Spring MVC app with JSP views to a Javascript MVC view architecture with a RESTful API  Is it worth it and any suggestionspli ol

Negative 854 pI am still learning about the MapReduce framework, specifically implemented by Hadoop, and I wonder if it can be modified to perform the following taskp  pThe Map function will emit key,value pairs, whose keys are arrays of size 2, say int[2]. I would like every pair containing any of the two integers in common to be mapped to the same reducer.p  pSo for example, if Map emits [2,3],4,[2,4],5,[6,5],2,[5,7],1, then Reduce1 should receive the first two pairs, and Reduce2 the second two first two sharing 2, second two sharing 5. This can be viewed as a connected component problem, where the vertices are the integers in the int[], and edges are shared between any two integers in the same int[].p

Negative 854 pIm working on an iPhone app with iOS 5.1 using Storyboards.  I have a UIViewController with a UITabBar component at the bottom.

If I set Interface Builder to 3.5 form factor then it runs fine on a 3.5 device, but the table is too short on a 4 device.  Likewise if I set the IB form factor to 4 it runs fine on a 4 device but the table is too long and runs underneath the tab bar on a 3.5 device.p  pIve never had problems with autoresizing between 3.54 devices before, but so far Ive only ever used UITabViewControllers for tab pages.

Negative 854 psnakemake is a pythonlike replacement for make that is geared more towards workflows than compilation.  Its quite nice, but also quite new, and I cannot seem to find a mode for it in Emacs.  I just want something very simple a very slight modification from fundamentalmode, so I in perusing the emacs manual, I started the following in init.elp  precodedefinederivedmode snakemode fundamentalmode    ...  codepre  plike make, snakemake is strict about indents actual tab t characters, not how emacs behaves by default when one types TAB.  When I instead type Cq TAB it puts a real tab character in the buffer  this works, I tried it with a Snakefile in fundamentalmode and it runs perfectly.  So to avoid typing Cq TAB each time I want a TAB in this mode, the first addition I would like to make to snakemode is to rebind the TAB key to Cq TAB or something like this.  So I perused the emacs manual and triedp  precodedefinederivedmode snakemode fundamentalmode   globalsetkey kbd t kbd Cq t   ...  codepre  pbut this and other alternatives arent working ... maybe rebinding standard keys like the TAB key is not a recommended practicep  pthe other addition to the snakemode I would like is for it to highlight syntax according to python but emnotem have any python behaviour, e.g., python indenting behaviourp  pTo conclude, just these 2 simple modifications to fundamentalmode in creating a snakemode and a way to also invoke snakemode if the filename is Snakefile was all I was looking for, but Ive already spent several hours perusing the emacs manual and doing some googling, and it seems Im not even close.  This is so simple, and Im quite sure it is possible any advicep  pThanksp  pMurrayp

For example There is a component named KN3 and its pins are named like AF18 KF3AF18  It writes like this in the text, like others.. So I will not write 1 or 2 then. I will write AF18 in the column1.

One could still be empty, but its height is then definedaligned with the other.li ul  pThe thing that I cant quite figure out is how to make the codecol1code and codecol2code divs stretch correctly to implement the above two points.p  pstrongEDITstrong Playing around with the suggestions I realize that its not so important to have codecol1code and codecol2code be the same size.  What is more important and the codelttablegtcode layout did work for that is that if there is nolittle content in those columns, then they stretch so that the codequickcode links stick to the bottom of the browser window.  I tried to set codebottom0code for codequickcode but that didnt work.p  pstrongEDITstrong While both answers below seem working solutions to the problem, I wanted to avoid Javascript and too much fuzz over this.  What I ended up doing is adding a codedivcol2  minheight100 code which stretches the div to the size of the browser window, and pushes the divquick down.  Most pages have a good amount of content anyway, so that works well for empty pages theres just some room at the bottom and that works fine p

Negative 854 pI know that my question may be very basic, but I wonder for the objects that are getting more than one cell in memory, like arrays and user defined objects that need more than one cell in memory and thus have the range of consecutive addresses in memory, what does a pointer really mean for this kind of objects Is it the variable in C that contains the address of these objects in memory logically not true because these objects have occupied more than one cell in memory and thus have range of consecutive addresses, or lets say pointers to these objects are just the beginning address of these objects more rational. p  pPlease help me understand and if you are not convinced with my interpretation about C pointers definition, give me the right one.p  blockquote   pIn most C tutorials it said that pointers just contain the addresses of other variables in memory.p blockquote

Negative 854 pI am creating a project in codevaadincode which runs on codeTomcatcode, but the question concerns generally a java webapplication. The application consists of a number of modules, which all together comprise the application. I want to adjust it, so as the way the application runs to be determined by the url. Therefore I attach a parameter to the url, the url seems namely asp  pcodehttpmyprojectanythingfoomodesthcode. p  pI extract the parameter in the method codeonRequestStartcodep  precodeString param  request.getParametermode codepre  pI build the application according to the parameter.

However I have a problem with the codebrowser cachecode especially on parameter codenormalcode. After running first time with this parameter, all the next times the browser does not realize a new request and shows the application from the cache, meaning the last module showed. Strangely on the other parameters I have not yet noticed this problem. Nevertheless, it is still not reliable and in order to make it certainly reliable I have to avoid browser cache. What could be a solution I have found that one solution is to add a codetimestampcode on the url, which must each time change so that it reads always a new url and makes a new request. How could I attach it though in a java application    p

Negative 854 pI was just writing a remarkably simply Stack class in Java on the eclipse Juno IDE that has 2 operations  push and pop. One check I have in the pop method is to see if the stack is empty if so, I throw a NoSuchElementException. Therefore, if I push 1,2,3,4,5 sequentially and then pop elements five times, I expect to see 5,4,3,2,1 printed out in that order. But after adding five elements, if i deliberately try to pop the stack SIX times, I would expect 5,4,3,2,1, and then a NoSuchElementException.p  pWhats happening in my case is that console prints out the NoSuchElementException haphazardly i.e. not always after printing out 5,4,3,2,1 sometimes it prints outp  precodestack pop 5 stack pop 4 Exception in thread main java.util.NoSuchElementException Stack Underflow stack pop 3 stack pop 2 stack pop 1     at Stack.popStack.java29     at Stack.mainStack.java47 codepre  pand sometimes it prints outp  precodeException in thread main stack pop 5 stack pop 4 stack pop 3 stack pop 2 stack pop 1 java.util.NoSuchElementException Stack Underflow     at Stack.popStack.java29     at Stack.mainStack.java47 codepre  pMy goal is to understand what governs this behavior.

My issue is that last codeSELECTcode statement. I try to go through the result of the query with the following PHP codep  precodestatement  dbhgtpreparequery statementgtexecuteparams  output[results]  array do      output[results][]  array     while  result  statementgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC               output[results][countoutput[results]1][]  result         if  issetresult[index]                       output[index]  intvalresult[index]                  if  issetresult[timestamp]                       output[timestamp]  result[timestamp]                while  statementgtnextRowset   echo jsonencodeoutput codepre  pThe idea is to use the codedo...whilecode block to get through the results from the codeINSERTcode statements, and then get the results of that final codeSELECTcode statement, which gets stored in my codeoutputcode.p  pOn my local machine running PHP 5.4.4, this works perfectly. On the server, which has PHP 5.3.10, codestatementgtnextRowsetcode returns false every time, so I only get the first rowset which is empty because itrsquos from the codeINSERTcode statement. Note that the actual insertions work correctly regardless, and when I run the above manuallyfilledin query in phpMyAdminrsquos SQL feature, it returns the correct result a table consisting of the inserted index and timestamp.p  pReading about these issues, it seems that multiple statements like this are a bad idea, and donrsquot actually work with true prepared statements, and Irsquom still using the default emulated prepared statements. So I could switch to separate calls of codedbhgtpreparecode and codestatementgtexecutecode, which would solve my problem, but Irsquom worried about race conditions. The server is using Nginx, and many users could be inputting entries at the same time. I donrsquot want codeLASTINSERTIDcode to return some other userrsquos entry and associate these fields with the wrong action.p  pIs there some reason within MySQL or PHP that prevents race condition issues Some step I could take Or is there a safe way to use multiple prepared statements And if the latter, does it work in PHP 3.5.10p

I named it MyPair. I also subclassed from stdmap and I named it MyMap. So that everytime I insert new MyPair in MyMap, it calls the inc member function of MyPair, so that MyPair would increment its ref member which is the counter of its reference. If I delete an instance of MyMap, it decrements all the ref member function of each of its contained MyPairs. If ref in MyPair hits 0, it means that it was no longer referenced, so it will delete itself.p  pThat code above works, because I managed to comment some lines of codes there in MyMap. When I uncomment them, the compiler gives me an error that says that stdpair has no members like inc and dec, even though I insert MyPair instances there at the main function. I know that the compiler doesnt notice that I inserted MyPair instances that contains those members, not just a plain stdpair.p  pIs theres a way that I can call those members of MyPairinc and dec inside MyMap Thanks for your answers in advance.p

Negative 854 pDisclaimer Im helping out on another developers code he didnt have the time and the customer wants it fixed quickly and so Im not totally familiar with this code.p  pSo the app is built for iOS 6, is in the App Store, and runs great. Until you try opening it on a device running iOS 7 GM. You see the splashscreen for a moment, then it crashes completely. This is causing problems because none of our users can use the app anymore after updating.p  pI just got the source code and I have been trying to figure it out. It compiles fine, and even runs in the iOS 7 simulator. Although, of course, the UI needs to be redesigned for iOS 7.p  pHeres where it gets weird when I run it on my iPhone 5 iOS 7 from Xcode, the app hangs just like with the App Store version, of course  but its just so weird, considering that in runs in the Simulator.p  pGood news is that I have some runtime errors that might help to track down the problem. I ran a search that indicates it could be a missing connection in a xib file, but I didnt find one. p  pHere is the log. If it helps, I can also include the build warnings.p  p20130920 201655.455 myappname[251460b] strong Terminating app due to uncaught exception CALayerInvalidGeometry, reason CALayer position contains NaN [nan nan] strong First throw call stack 0x2e3d0e8b 0x386ca6c7 0x2e3d0dcd 0x307d5feb 0x307d5eef 0x307d5e7f 0x30b53517 0x30b6373b 0x30c042f1 0x30b56533 0x307ddf43 0x307d9767 0x30b6b411 0x30b67ed5 0x30be7501 0x30be71a1 0x30c03685 0x30bcf53d 0x30c034bf 0x30b55f3d 0x30b55d19 0x30b55609 0x2ed32143 0x30b55495 0x30b62153 0x30b61bd3 0x30c43e13 0x30c8398b 0x30c83961 0x30c82abf 0x30c82663 0x30c8256f 0x5c4d7 0x30bc7425 0x30bc6e6b 0x30bc14b9 0x30b5bbe7 0x30b5aedd 0x30bc0ca1 0x3303c76d 0x3303c357 0x2e39b77f 0x2e39b71b 0x2e399ee7 0x2e304541 0x2e304323 0x30bbff43 0x30bbb1e5 0x5b485 0x38bc3ab7 libcabi.dylib terminating with uncaught exception of type NSExceptionp  pThread 1 signal SIGABRTp  pI really have no idea what is going on. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated p
Negative 854 pIm trying to import a CVS repository into git.  Unfortunately, weve been using a really old method of creating releases from our CVS repo, that doesnt involve any actual CVS branches or tags, but keep that information in a separate system.  Consequently, almost all of the development happens on the CVS trunk.  So, one file may be added very early in the history, but doesnt become part of the release for 6 months.p  pWhat Id like to do is import this CVS repo into git, and use rebasing to move these commits to development branches.  I do have some branches from CVS though, so I really want to move all branches.p  pSay Ive got thisp  precode                  FGH topic                   ABCDEIJ master codepre  pcodeBcode is the commit that I want to move to its own branch.

Negative 854 pI have written a working implementation of a Comment and Reply system in procedural PHP. I want to learn OOP so I am going to convert my old code into OOP following SOLID principles. In a book I am reading the author says that a class should do one thing and one thing only. p  pIn my comment and reply system I generate several div elements dynamically with the same class name but different ids. An example of what I am generating can be seen a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netDh8nF relnofollowherea.p  pI would like to break my code into functions so that I can maintain it much easier, but I am having trouble understanding the best way to do this. For example I have several nested divs p  precodeltdiv classcontentgt     ltdiv classphotoContainer id1gt ltimg srchttpplacekitten.com200200 gt ltdivgt         ltdiv classcommentReplyContainer id1gt             ltdiv classcommentBox id1gt                 ltform methodpostgt                     lttextarea namecommentgtlttextareagt                     ltinput typesubmit gt                 ltformgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classcommentEvengtHello I am a commentltdivgt             ltdivgt  ltdivgt    ltdiv classcontentgt     ltdiv classphotoContainer id2gt ltimg srchttpplacekitten.com200300 gt ltdivgt         ltdiv classcommentReplyContainer id2gt             ltdiv classcommentBox id2gt                 ltform methodpostgt                     lttextarea namecommentgtlttextareagt                     ltinput typesubmit gt                 ltformgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classcommentEvengtHello I am another commentltdivgt             ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pSome of the codedivscode are closed right away like the codephotoContainercode div. Also the codecommentBoxcode div is closed right after adding the form inside. The issue that I see is that the codecontentcode div is closed after all the content has been added inside it and so is the codecommentReplyContainercode. So If I follow the SOLID principles to convert this into OOP code I should have a class that generates the codecontentcode div, another class to generate the codephotoContainercode div and so on If I use that method then I would have to write a class that generates the codecontentcode div but does not close it, generate the codephotoContainercode div with expected content and close it, then have a class that is called last that will close the codecontentcode div. Am I correct because this is the only way that I have been able to get my divs to be nested in the way I wantp  precodeltphp  class CreateCommentSystem       public function generateContentDiv     content  ltltltEOF         ltdiv classcontent stylebackgroundcolor 302058 width 100px height 200pxgt EOF         echo content           public function generatePhotoContainer     photoContainer  ltltltEOF         ltdiv classphotoContainer stylebackgroundcolor df5320 width 40px height 20pxgt ltdivgt EOF         echo photoContainer           public function closeContentDiv          closeContentDiv  ltltltEOF             ltdivgt EOF         echo closeContentDiv        gt codepre  pThen execute it as p  precodedivs  new CreateCommentSystem divsgtgenerateContentDiv divsgtgeneratePhotoContainer divsgtcloseContentDiv codepre  pAm I on the right track or is my understanding completely wrong Maybe there is a much better way that I am not aware of someone could point out.

Negative 854 pMy question is concerning an accordian type menu script I have been fiddling with for my a hrefhttpwww.conalstubbs.co.uk relnofollowsitea.p  pIn essence there is a container div classed navigation, which contains menu buttons and a couple of submenus which are hidden and revealed depending on the users clicks of the menu buttons. Beneath this on the page is a div called push which pushes a footer div to the bottom and keeps it there as push changes size depending on changes in height of the navigation menu as it expandscontracts or if the window is resized etc.p  pThe problem lies in updating the size of the navigation menu based on the expansion or contraction of the submenus, which has a subsequent impact on the sizing of the push element as it uses this navigation height in its calculations.p  pThe maximum size each sub menu can be is constant as there are only the number of items they contain, and the user cannot alter this. Each sub menu will be a different size depending on the number of items they contain. These values are stored in variables at the very start of the script, before they are collapsed. The minimum size the navigation can be is also constant as it can only be its smallest when all the sub menus are collapsed. As such, the changes in height of the navigation can be expressed as the baseNavigationHeight  subMenuHeight if expanding and the navigationHeight at that particular moment  subMenuHeight if contracting.p  pMy problem seems to come on loading the site in the browser for the first time values are taken from using Chrome element inspector, other browsers seem to give slightly different values. Here it is stepbystep.p  ol lipOn load, we are told that the navigation menu in its collapsed state is 80px high. This is correct as far as I can determine, so so far, so good.pli lipIf we expand one of the submenus e.g. work, navigation expands to 95px tall. Also check how the other submenu e.g. about, affects it  it grows to 95px again.pli lipIf we click on the link in the submenu we are taken to another page. On this page depending on the type of page the relevant sub menu is expanded and highlighted to aid navigation.pli lipIf we check the height of navigation on this page we are told it equals 98px tall, despite being in the same configuration as on the last page where it was 95px tall i.e. jQuery was saying the submenu was 15px tall, now its saying 18px tall. The latter is the correct number I believe based on how close the last menu button is to the boundary of the navigation menu when its height is given at 95px, and how it overlaps said boundary when the submenu is longer. pli ol  pThis addition of 3px is not limited to the menu that is expanded either, as the other submenu e.g. about also returns a value of 18px now. This discrepancy of 3px is multiplied by however many number of rows are in the menu I added additional on my local test version, meaning although it is relatively minor now, as more stuff is added, the discrepancy will escalate.p  pI can only assume that there is a problem in how the browser is displaying  formatting the elements subsequent to the script grabbing the height values on the initial loading of the first page. On subsequent pages or even if the initial pages is refreshed the script is cached and so runs that bit faster. Has anybody else experienced something like this Any suggestions on how to eliminate this discrepancy on the initial loadp  pMenu scriptbrp  precodedocument.readyfunction    SET VARIABLES      var speed  300  var menu  .menu var subMenu  .submenu var navigation  .navigation var workMenu  workmenu var aboutMenu  aboutmenu  var aboutHeight  aboutMenu.outerHeighttrue var workHeight  workMenu.outerHeighttrue var baseNavigationHeight  navigation.height    DEFINE FUNCTIONS  function pushResize var windowHeight  window.outerHeighttrue var logoHeight  .logo.outerHeighttrue var navigationHeight  navigation.height var footerHeight  .footer.outerHeighttrue var otherHeights  logoHeight  navigationHeight  footerHeight var newHeight  windowHeight  otherHeights .push.heightnewHeight .mainright.prependltpgtWindow Height  windowHeightltpgtltpgtLogo height  logoHeightltpgtltpgtNavigation Height  navigationHeightltpgtltpgtFooter Height  footerHeightltpgtltpgtTotal  otherHeightsltpgtltpgtPush Height  newHeightltpgtltpgtWork Menu  workHeightltpgtltpgtAbout Menu  aboutHeightltpgtltpgtBase Navigation Height  baseNavigationHeightltpgt      ON START  pushResize subMenu.hide      Test Page Type         Test if an About page             if .about.length gt 0                  aboutMenu.show                 navabout.addClassactive                 var newNavigationHeight  baseNavigationHeight  aboutHeight                 navigation.heightnewNavigationHeight                 pushResize              else if.work.length gt 0                 workMenu.show                 navwork.addClassactive                 var newNavigationHeight  baseNavigationHeight  workHeight                 navigation.heightnewNavigationHeight                 pushResize                 ON WINDOW ADJUSTMENT  window.resizepushResize      ON MENU BUTTON CLICK       If ABOUT is clicked         navabout.clickfunction             var this  this             var navigationHeight  navigation.height              ifthis.hasClassactive                 aboutMenu.slideUpspeed                 this.removeClassactive                 var newNavigationHeight  navigationHeight  aboutHeight                 navigation.heightnewNavigationHeight              else                  menu.removeClassactive                 subMenu.slideUpspeed                 aboutMenu.slideDownspeed                 this.addClassactive                 var newNavigationHeight  baseNavigationHeight  aboutHeight                 navigation.heightnewNavigationHeight                          pushResize               If WORK is clicked         navwork.clickfunction             var this  this             var navigationHeight  navigation.height              ifthis.hasClassactive                 workMenu.slideUpspeed                 this.removeClassactive                 var newNavigationHeight  navigationHeight  workHeight                 navigation.heightnewNavigationHeight                          else                  menu.removeClassactive                 subMenu.slideUpspeed                            workMenu.slideDownspeed                 this.addClassactive                 var newNavigationHeight  baseNavigationHeight  workHeight                 navigation.heightnewNavigationHeight                          pushResize            ready ends codepre

I am using the following code.p  pcode Intent browserIntent  new IntentIntent.ACTIONVIEW, Uri.parsehttpsintranet.dmpdev1.com startActivitybrowserIntentcodep  pOn the webpage it asks for username and password. And a combination of user credentials and certificate is used to authenticate the user. The certificate is already installed in the keychain.p  pTill 4.3, it used to work but on 4.4 emulator it does not work. I know that in 4.4, the underlying engine has been changed to chromium but does that mean that this functionality of certificate based authentication has been removedp

Negative 854 pIm new to VB.NET programming, so pointing to examples is greatly appreciated.p  pIve got a OleDB connection to an Oracle 11g database.  Im reading a single row from a table and trying to populate a row object mClockInOutInfo.  The problem Im running into is that there is a null DateTime timestamp column in the returned row.p  pOf course, I started with the mClockInOutInfo.RowDate  dr.GetDateTime0 assume the RowDate column is the first column in the query.p  pI quickly found out that nulls should be checked, so I added the  IfIsDBNulldr.GetDateTime0, DBNull.value, dr.getDateTime0 to the code.  I now use the NullSafeString functions found around here somewhere. But there was nothing for DateTime types.  I tried to make one, no success.   So Im still with the IfIsDbNull... code for my datetime columns.p  pThe problem Im having is that I get the error Specified cast is not valid. when evaluating that statement.  Ive verified the column type with the .GetDataTypeName0 method. It returns DBTYPEDBTIMESTAMP.  Ive reviewed the schema information to verify that the column is actually the information Im looking for.  From what I can tell, the error is being generated while evaluating the IsDBNulldrRecent.GetDateTime0 portion of the if statement.  Ive confirmed this by breaking the statement into a multiline if statement if IsDBNulldr.GetDateTime0 Then ... Else ... End Ifp  pI get the same cast error thrown by the if IsDBNull... line.p  pSo, I went back to the SQL string and did a Coalesce on the column with the empty data in it.  I received the same cast error. Finally, frustrated, I changed the sql query to use the TODATE function and fed in a date string with the appropriate format parameter.  I STILL receive this same cast error.p  pThe property in the mClockInOutInfo is defined as DateTime.  There are other columns defined exactly the same way and those that have data in the table are not giving any errors.p  pAny ideas of what I should be doing when the database allows nulls in a DateTime Timestamp column  All ideas welcomed.  Thank you in advance.p

Negative 854 pIm planning to make a system that will utilize a strongcentral corporate databasestrong and several stronglocal inhouse database.strongp  pConnection between the central database and local databases would depend on the locals availability The central database is always online. So Im thinking of synchronizing them by pushing updates from the local database to the central database using a website user interface and vice versa. p  pThe central database is expected to have decent and stable internet connection. So it just sit there waiting for updates from local databases. Also local systems should have the capability to download updates from some tables that are only updated from the central database. The local system should only contain local information and general settings set by the central system. Local systems have no capability to see other local information in other branchesThis capability is only for the central system.p  pSo basically, information that are pushed to the central database are only modified in the local system and the data downloaded from the central database are only updated from the central database. So the local system can live and operate on its own, and the only true purpose of the central database is to create an overview of all the updates. p  pIve already checked Microsoft Sync Framework and it looks promising. I just cant find any tutorial that could demonstrate it completely. Im hoping for a solution that can be implemented using a website interface. Just a nice  button in my local systems page. p  pIf anyone would be able to point me to good source or starting point, it would be really helpful.p
Negative 854 pI am using the samples provided by Amazon to make an app to upload videos to the server S3. The sample generates a bucket and stores an image there. In my case, I am using previously generated bucket to store the videos, but if I erase the bucket generation code the video upload stops in the way. The generated bucket is not used to store the video. Also, if the bucket generation throws an exception because the bucket already exists for example the file upload still works.p  pI think there is another initialization I have to do before send the files.

While doing so each time I have to manually enter the USER ID which I mention in the SIP.conf file  of the client whom I want to contact with. Is there any way such that I can retrieve the Dialplan users list from the Asterisk server onto my Android SIP client. Please suggest me with any solution possible. Thank You.p

Negative 854 pIve been reading on different cryptography algorithms and I came across the Diffie Hellman Cryptography Next Generation. Ive made a lot of searches about this algorithm and I have  found that it is an Asymmetric cryptography system which is in some ways rivaling RSA. I had a look at the .Nets codeSystem.Security.Cryptographycode and I found it provides DiffieHellman cryptography as well. So I went to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryvstudiosystem.security.cryptography.ecdiffiehellmancng28vvs.10029 relnofollowMSDNa and there I found a very nice example on how to use it in C, but this example has brought some questions into my mind. Let me copy some part of the code first I dont post the full code as my question is mainly about this partp  precodepublic static byte[] alicePublicKey  public static void Mainstring[] args      using ECDiffieHellmanCng alice  new ECDiffieHellmanCng               alice.KeyDerivationFunction  ECDiffieHellmanKeyDerivationFunction.Hash         alice.HashAlgorithm  CngAlgorithm.Sha256         alicePublicKey  alice.PublicKey.ToByteArray         Bob bob  new Bob         CngKey k  CngKey.Importbob.bobPublicKey, CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPublicBlob         byte[] aliceKey  alice.DeriveKeyMaterialCngKey.Importbob.bobPublicKey, CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPublicBlob         byte[] encryptedMessage  null         byte[] iv  null         SendaliceKey, Secret message, out encryptedMessage, out iv         bob.ReceiveencryptedMessage, iv         private static void Sendbyte[] key, string secretMessage, out byte[] encryptedMessage, out byte[] iv      using Aes aes  new AesCryptoServiceProvider              aes.Key  key         iv  aes.IV           Encrypt the message         using MemoryStream ciphertext  new MemoryStream         using CryptoStream cs  new CryptoStreamciphertext, aes.CreateEncryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write                      byte[] plaintextMessage  Encoding.UTF8.GetBytessecretMessage             cs.WriteplaintextMessage, 0, plaintextMessage.Length             cs.Close             encryptedMessage  ciphertext.ToArray                  codepre  pWhen I look at this, I see that it is the AES that is doing everything, and the codeECDiffieHellmancode is only responsible for providing a key for the AES algorithm. In the meanwhile it itself is based on the SHA256 hashing system.p  pSo my question is, what exactly is this ECDiffieHellmanCng doing in this case What I see is a hybrid cryptography system, one for key exchange and the other for the encryption, this has conflict with what Ive read over the internet about this Diffie Hellman algorithm, most sources list it under Asymmetric encryption systems but this example is not showing the same thing. I say this because when I look the codeAliceKeycode I see that, it is made based on a Public Key that has been probably made using SHA256 and it itself is not encrypting decryption anything.         p

Negative 854 pIm trying to implement a path tracer using THREE.js. Im basically rendering a fullscreen quad and the path tracing happens in the pixel shader.p  pI want a higher sampling rate and one way to do so is to sample one path for each pixel and accumulate the resulting images. i.e. averaging out the images obtained at each shader passp  pAs it is I am able to generate the images I need but I have no idea how to accumulate them. My guess would be that I have to use two render targets one would contain the latest sampled image and one would contain the average of all the images displayed so far.p  pI just dont know how to get the data from a WebGLRenderTarget and use it to manipulate the data contained in another render target. Is this even something possible thats possible with Three.js Ive been looking into FrameBuffer Objects and this seems like a promising path and I am combing through MrDoobs FBO example a hrefhttpwww.mrdoob.comlabjavascriptwebglparticlesparticleszz85.html relnofollowhttpwww.mrdoob.comlabjavascriptwebglparticlesparticleszz85.htmla and it appears promising but Im not sure Im headed down the right path.p

The error that appear with the Excel Document is p  blockquote   pError Cannot implicitly convert type string[em,em] to Excel.Range Line Anonymously Hosted DynamicMethods Assembly.p blockquote  pI have already tried to save everything under the same string, but there is also no difference. And I know it saves the correct values either in codePorfFahrtcode as also in codeBremTestcode, because I checked that.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using

Negative 854 pIm trying to create a simple D2D game engine it must be able to display and move images in a window, at least, and everything went right until the moment when I decided to switch to the multithreaded version.

Negative 854 pFor a project we require using a Raspberry Pi to monitor sending devices around it for a location service. For the monitoring wifi antenna we use a RT 3070 via USB. We require a second connection for the server connection too, and this is where the problem probably lies.p  pAfter a fresh install, monitoring using tcpdump on the correct interface works without a problem. However the server connection is via ethernet, which we wont be able to use for the other Pis. Therefor we have a second antenna that should automatically connect to a specific hotspot where it will receive a static IP.p  pThe idea is that the Pi will, on boot, automatically create a mon0 interface on the dongle for monitoring and connect to the hotspot with the other dongle. To this effect we have used some scripts and edited some settings which enables this.p  pHowever upon boot the mon0 interface is incapable of sniffing any packets beyond broadcasts including those we want to detect.p  pThe steps we edited arep  ul liedited ifplugd to ignore the monitor interfaceli liinstalled ifrename to ensure the interfaces are always bound to the same MAC addressli licreated iftab where the interfaces are bound to the correct MAC addressli liedited interfaces to set the monitor interface to manual configurationli liedited wpasupplicant to connect the normal interface to the hotspotli liusing airmonng, create and start the monitor interface on a specific channelli ul  pI can post the files as they were before and after too, if required.p

Negative 854 pIm working on writing a class that essentially provides a flexible interface to some other data.

Negative 854 pWe currently have a single database with users, customers, products and orders logically separated by schemas. We then have several MVC.net applications accessing the database via their own BLLs. Each of these applications have their own functionality and share some aspects with someall of the other applications.p  pCurrently, some code is duplicated in these BLLs and its a bit of a mess to maintain. It does however, allow us to develop features quickly and deploy each application independently assuming on major database work here.p  pWe have started to develop a single access layer, properly separated out that sits above the database and is used by all of our MVC.net applications. Logically this makes sense as we can now share code between our applications. For example, application A can retrieve a customer record in the same way as application B. The issue comes when we want to deploy an application, we wouldnt be able to deploy one application, wed need to deploy them all.p  pWhat other architectural approaches could we consider that would allow us to share code between our applications and deploy those applications independentlyp

Negative 854 pI have a problem with a Qt program only receiving UDP [Artnet] datagrams from my STM32 modules when the STM32 is set to some seemingly random, but specific IP addresses. p  pSo, I have the followingp  ol liLinux Machine Running Qt program with dynamic IP addressli liSTM32 Running FreeRTOS Module manually set to address A li liSTM32 Running FreeRTOS Module manually set to address Bli ol  pI have written the Qt software and used uIP with FreeRTOS on the STM32 boards  modifying uIP to work with UDP properly and added simple Artnet code. p  pAll are on 192.168.0.x subnet. p  pIve written the Qt program to send out an Artnet poll to the subnets broadcast address. So, it sends the standard Artnet poll out on UDP port 6454 to address 192.168.0.255. Wireshark, shows my two STM32 modules return Artnet Poll Replies just fine. So far, so good. p  pHowever, where it starts to get really weird is that if I, for example, set one STM32 to have an IP address of 192.168.0.177 and the other to 192.168.0.176, the 177 node is seen and processed by the Qt program, however, despite the 176 node sending back a correct Artnet poll reply, the Qt program flatly refuses to read the reply packet. If I change the IP address of the 176 node to be .44, then the Qt program processes the reply. If I change the [working] .177 node to be, say, .43, it does not work. p  pI should stress that whatever IP address I set the STM32s to, Wireshark indicates all is well with the replies.p  pCan anyone suggest anything that might shed light on this please Ive played around with netcat, but that doesnt seem to read any of these Artnet replies, no matter what address they come from, so I might misunderstand what netcat can do. Ive tried netcat with my Qt program only opening and outbound port, not an inbound and it makes no difference, but again, I might completely misunderstand netcat or something about UDP. Maybe if you open an outbound UDP port, the same inbound is automatically opened  p  pThere are no IP address clashes going on and I have no firewall turned on, on my Linux machine.p  pMany thanks.p  pEdit Added code as requested.p  precodevoid MainWindowprocessPendingDatagramsvoid      struct ArtNetPollReplyStruct newReply     QHostAddress sendingAddress     quint16 sendingUdpPort     QString versionString     QByteArray datagram      while udpReceiveSocketgthasPendingDatagrams                     datagram.resizeudpReceiveSocketgtpendingDatagramSize         udpReceiveSocketgtreadDatagramdatagram.data, datagram.size, ampsendingAddress,ampsendingUdpPort         newReply  struct ArtNetPollReplyStructdatagram.data         if newReplygtOpCode  OPPOLLREPLY                          if sendingAddress  QHostAddress192.168.0.18                                  if checkAndAddAddresssendingAddress                                          versionString  QStringnumbernewReplygtVersionInfoH,10  .

Negative 854 pI have an application that uses a mix of MVC pages and SPA pages backed by Web API calls. Web API is configured to use bearer token authentication, and MVC uses cookie authentication. In order to ensure that the cookie and the bearer token are both present amp valid, I make a Web API call that requires authorization from an MVC page, and Im trying to make an equivalent call from a SPA page to a web API method with authentication overridden, something like thisp  precode[Authorize] public class TestController  ApiController      [OverrideAuthentication]     [HostAuthenticationDefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie]     public IHttpActionResult GetIsAuthenticatedCookie              return Oktrue           other methods that use bearer token authentication excluded for brevity  codepre  pFor whatever reason, this does not work the request is always unauthorized regardless of the presence of a valid cookie.

Negative 854 pIntent Control arduino uno from serial portp  pToolsp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comJanStevensArduinoPiPython relnofollowhttpsgithub.comJanStevensArduinoPiPythonap  pI got the server working on both my mac and my Model b Raspberry. The browser behaves as shown in the picture below in both situations.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeOafO.jpg altp  pTo me it looks like the server sent the message to Arduino successfully. But the data somehow gets lost on the way. The Arduino board resets every time I access the url in my browser. I googled and found that a 10uF capacitor between ground and reset pins would prevent the reset from happening. It did, but pin 3 wont go HIGH. I got a LEDRESISTOR plugged on pin 3 and ground accordingly. I can see the Rx led blinking every time I access the url.

As best I can tell it is correctly deployed in the repo, and this problem only occurs if you remove the custom plugin from your local repository.p

Negative 854 pI would like to implement JWT based authentication to our new REST API. But since the expiration is set in the token, how to automatically prolong it I dont want users to need to sign in after every X minutes if they were actively using the application in that period. That would be a huge UX fail. But prolonging the expiration creates a new token and the old one is still valid until it expires. And generating a new token after each request sounds silly to me. Sounds like a security issue when more than one token is valid at the same time. Ofc I could invalidate the old used one using a blacklist but it would need to store the tokens. And one of the benefits of JWT is no storage...p  pI found how auth0 solved it. They use not only JWT token but also a refresh token. a hrefhttpsdocs.auth0.comrefreshtokenhttpsdocs.auth0.comrefreshtokenap  pBut again, to implement this not using auth0 needs a storage to store refresh tokens and maintain their expiration. It makes me asking what is the real benefit then Why not to have only one token not JWT and keep the expiration on the serverp  pAre there other options Or is using JWT not suited for this scenariop

Negative 854 pI have a system that logs information about running processes. Each running process contains a series of steps that may or may not run in parallel. The system logs information about a process and its steps to two separate tablesp  precodeCREATE TABLE pid    pid         integer,   starttime  timestamp,   endtime    timestamp,   elapsed     bigint,   aborted     integer,   label       char30   CREATE TABLE pidstep    pid         integer,   step        integer,   starttime  timestamp,   endtime    timestamp,   elapsed     bigint,   mem         bigint,   ...  codepre  pThe codepidstepcode table contains a bunch of resource usage stats about each step which I have simplified here as just the codememcode column which logs the  of bytes of memory allocated for that step. I want to sample memory allocation by process label, perhaps at 5 second intervals, so I can plot it. I need a result similar to the followingp  precodetick                    label  mem    20141104 053740.0   foo      328728576 20141104 053740.0   bar         248436 20141104 053740.0   baz        1056144 20141104 053745.0   foo     1158807552 20141104 053745.0   bar         632822 20141104 053745.0   baz         854398 codepre  pSince the logs only give me starting and ending timestamps for each process and step instead of a sample of resource usage at 5 second intervals, I need to find the most efficient way to determine which process steps were running at each 5 second interval tick and then aggregate their allocated memory. Ive made 3 separate attempts that all produce the same results with varying levels of performance. For brevitys sake Ill put each query and its explain plan in a gist a hrefhttpsgist.github.comanonymous3b57f70015b0d234a2de relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comanonymous3b57f70015b0d234a2dea but Ill explain my approach for eachp  ol lipThis was my first attempt and it is definitely the most intuitive and easiest to maintain. It cross joins the distinct process labels with codegenerateseriescode to generate the 5 second ticks for each label, then left joins on the codepidcode and codepidstepcode tables. The left join creates a zerofill effect and ensures we do not drop out any ticks that have no associated data. Unfortunately this approach performs the worst see benchmark link below and I believe it is due to the use of a hash join where the codebetween t2.starttime and t2.endtimecode predicate is handled as a join filter instead of a join condition.pli lipThis was my second attempt and it performs way better but is a lot less intuitive and maintainable. The zerofill approach is the same as in query 1. But, before performing the left join of codepidcode and codepidstepcode, I precompute the ticks that have associated data based on the max process elapsed time and the process steps start and end times. This allows for a sort merge join where both the tick and label predicates can be expressed as a join condition and no join filters are used.pli lipThis was my final attempt and it performs the best with about the same intuitiveness and maintainability as query 2. The optimization here is that I use the max process step elapsed time which is guaranteed to be smaller than the max process elapsed time and therefore creates a smaller nested loop at the beginning of CTE t3.pli ol  pIdeally, Id like the SQL to be as simple and maintainable as query 1 but perform as well as query 3. Is there anything I can do in the way of indexes or a slight rewrite of query 1 that would improve the performancep  pstrongBenchmark Resultsstrong a hrefhttpi.imgur.comyZxdQlM.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comyZxdQlM.pngap

Negative 854 pi am searching for a way to store different type of pointers in a map without using void for obvious reasons. I actually know the types of the pointers at compiletime and these pointers as well as their types need to be const while their values need to be changed from times to times. The types are always some kind of numerical types. p  pstrongBackgroundstrong The variables behind these pointer are actually always global variables which need to changed if an specific event happens. Eachs event has an Id, the first member of that map, which changes the variable to a value transported by that event as a string.p  pSo far i think boostvariant would do the trick. I am new to variant and i dont know whether the following would work as expected regarding the constness, but i assume after reading the fcking manual that it should be ok. The main issue still is how to change that value behind that pointer utilising the standard conversionsp  precodeclass Data     public     typedef boostsharedptrltDatagt Ptr     typedef boostvariantltdouble, float, unsigned int, int, unsigned short, short, unsigned char, chargt PodPointerVariant     double factor     const PodPointerVariant varPointer      DataPodPointerVariant variable           factor0.0,         varPointervariable       stdmapltunsigned int, DataPtrgt dataMap unsigned int intValue   float floatValue  void main      intValue  1     DataPtr newEntrynew DataampintValue     newEntrygtfactor  1.1     dataMapgtinsertstdmakepair1,newEntry       Omitted find key and safety if not found...     unsigned int eventId  1     dataMap[eventId]gtvarPointer  2.1  dataMap[1]gtfactor  Should be automagically converted to 2 because the pointer is of type unsigned int, but gives a compiler error I cant dereference that normally.   codepre  pIs there an easy way to dereference like this Maybe using a visitor class Or anything else Ideally DatavarPointer shall only be initialised once and only the value may be changed, like a double  const, so i gets checked at compiledtime if somebody messes around with that pointer. p  pThank youp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAfter some trial and error i found out that it indeed works as expected.

Weve tested them, they were fixed, but one or two months later, they show up again. p  pWe have svn and we can se who changed the classes with the show annotation option Eclipse, but it seems that most of our developers doesnt use this feature.

Negative 854 pWhen running a heavy query on the database, while the query is running on the database server cancel query seems to run correctly and succeeds in interrupting the thread waiting for the result set. However, once the database starts returning results and Hibernate starts mapping the result set to the POJOs, it appears that cancel query no longer has any effect. This is a problem for me because we experience an codeOutOfMemoryErrorcode when the query returns a very large result.p  pAny suggestions how to intervene in the mapping process to cause the cancel the mappingp
Negative 854 pI am confused with a concept in python  base class overriding. I learned that you can have two different functions with the same name in different classes, and the correct function will be called on an object depending on which class the object is from. However, I have just learned about the super call, and I learned that you can use it if you overrode correct past tense a function that you need back. Im confused because the overridden function isnt gone in the first place, is it Why do I need to restore it using the super callp

The image above in all cases is ignored via pointerevents none, and the click passes through to whatever is underneath.  We can tell this via the event listener for the bottom two, and since the top 4 are youtube iframe embeds, we can tell because the click starts the video these are live vids, btw, so be sure to click in the center or you may be taken to youtube.p  pSo, all is well... until I put it up on a site.  Ive tried four times in both local and hosted environments, and I always get the same result The bottom two behave as expected, and the click goes through the image to the div below.  However, the iframe youtube does not register the click IF 100 of its pixels are covered by the image above.  If even one pixel is exposed, it clicks through as it should.  This is why the short set is there.  The images above those videos are exactly one pixel narrower than the video underneath.  p  pIn firefox,however, the videos that are 100 covered will not trigger.  It works fine in Chrome and Safari that I have tested so far, but not in firefox.p  pI cant find a single mention of this issue anywhere.p  pIve done test after test to narrow down what is happening here. p  pIs this a youtube issue  A firefox issue  An iframe issue  Could it have to do with the lack of an origin tag on the iframe  Perhaps some difference in the configuration of my documents head vs fiddle  Ive tried similar on codepen as well, and it works just fine clicks pass through... until I put it up on a site and use firefox.p  pedited to add  just did simplified case on codepen as well, and clicks go through just fine on there, but not when I hostp  pa hrefhttpcodepen.iooompaLoompapenQwqRER relnofollowhttpcodepen.iooompaLoompapenQwqRERap  precodeltiframe      classvideo full jpgOverVideoFull     width200      height150      srchttpswww.youtube.comembedDEzREJblno     frameborder0      allowfullscreengt ltiframegt  ltdiv classimage full jpgOverVideoFull      stylebackgroundimageurlhttpimages.nationalgeographic.comwpfmedialivephotos000247cacheproboscismonkeyintree24704600x450.jpg gtjpg full vidltdivgt  ltiframe      classvideo full pngOverVideoFull     width200      height150      srchttpswww.youtube.comembedDEzREJblno     frameborder0      allowfullscreengt ltiframegt  ltdiv classimage full pngOverVideoFull     stylebackgroundimageurlhttpwww.whaleoil.co.nzwpcontentuploads201205monkey.png gtpng full vidltdivgt codepre  pand the cssp  precode.video, .image,      height150px     position absolute     fontsize30px     colorF2F     textalign center  .image      zindex1     pointerevents none     backgroundsize cover   .jpgOverVideoFull      top20px     left20px   .pngOverVideoFull      top190px     left20px   .full      width200px   .short      width199px  codepre

Negative 854 pIm working on some software that is essentially a pubsub framework.p  pOn subscription, I have to keep a record of what is being subscribed to, and I need to make both subscription and unsubscription atomic operations.

Negative 854 pMy goal is a sorted data structure that can accomplish 2 thingsp  ol liFast insertion at the location according to sort orderli liI can quickly segment my data into the sets of everything greater than or less than or equal to an element. strongI need to know the size of each of these partitionsstrong, and I need to be able to get these partitions.li ol  pCurrently, Im implementing this in java using an codeArrayListcode which provides 2 very easily since I can perform binary search codeCollections.binarySearchcode and get an insertion index telling me at what point an element would be inserted. Then based on the fact that indices range from 0 to the size of the array, I immediately know how many elements are greater than my element or smaller than my elements, and I can easily get at those elements as a sublist. However, this doesnt have property 1, and results in too much array copying. p  pThis makes me want to use something like a SkipList or RedBlackTree that could perform the insertions faster, but then I cant figure out how to satisfy property 2 without making it take ON time. p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks p  pEDIT Thanks for the answers below that reference data structures that perform the insertion in OlogN time and that can partition quickly as well, but I want to highlight the size requirement  I need to know the size of these partitions without having to traverse the entire partition which, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14750374whatiscomplexityofsizefortreesetportionviewinjavaaccording to thisa is what the TreeSet does. The reasoning behind this is that in my use case I maintain my data using several different copies of data structures each using a different comparator, and then need to ask according to what comparator is the set of all things larger than a particular element smallest. In the codeArrayListcode case, this is actually easy and takes only OYlogN where Y is the number of comparators, because I just binary search each of the Y arrays and return the arraylist with the highest insertion index. Its unclear to me how I could this with a TreeSet without taking OYN. p  pI should also add that an approximate answer for the insertion index would still be valuable even if it couldnt be solved exactly. p

Negative 854 pI have a unique requirement that Im not sure how to handle. We are working with an underlying repository that allows for a quite a bit of flexibility with regards to parameters. The Controller services are injected as service objects into a Service Property for our controller classes and they wrap the calls to entity framework.  eg. p  precodepublic UserControllerApiController    public IUserSvc Service getset    public UserControllerIUserSvc service    this.Serviceservice      codepre  pThis part is handled by Autofac and all is well here. p  pNext, we have the standard GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH methods in the controller that accept a SINGLE stronguser modelstrong. In other words, there is only ONE user model that is ever used, and therein lies the problem. p  pWhile the underlying service class just handles the passing of data back and forth, it pushes the requirement of the granular control of validation up the pipe. This isnt abnormal to me.p  pGiven that we have a single API that uses models with validation attributes, weve run into an issue where different apps that call into the api require different types of emvalidationem. The model structure is fine. Its just that some properties, depending on who you are and what HTTPMethod is sent, either strongarestrong or strongare notstrong validated. p  pex p  precodepublic class User   public int UserID getset   public string Name getset   codepre  pLets take 2 scenarios   1. Basic User  2. System Userp  pAs a basic user, UserID is required for GET, PUT,PATCH   and technically delete too but its not used. It is not required for POST because that would be creating their own user. p  pAs a system user, UserID is NOT required in GET but is required in PUT, PATCH, DELETE.p  pSo I am having a hard time trying to figure out how to do this without making one api for Basic User with their own models and one for System User. p  pI wanted to keep this high in the pipe so I wasnt doing this in the controller api methods, i.e. Check rolesclaims, createcastor otherwise map bound model to specific concrete model per roleclaim and then run validation and THEN return model binding errors if any. Thats a lot of gunk in the method and I would prefer this to be on an attribute of the method or api controller. p  pIs there any way to do a type of model binding and or model validation based on who you are That could be by role or claim p

The method will return codetruecode if the method was success.p  pI have an alternative solution In order to get the model ID, so I have to query the latest ID in the model database, and use it to the method. BUT Im afraid if there is someone else who access the codeactionTambahKnowledgecodein same time. So the model ID that retrieved from the database become unconsistent. For example, Mr.X access the codeactionTambahKnowledgecode. I Assume that Mr.X has a model ID that equals to code1code. But in same time, Mr.Y access the action too and Mr.Y get the same ID because Mr.X is not save the action yet. finally, Mr.X was successed to save the model and the method with the right model ID. Mr.Y was also successed save the model and the method, but the data that Mr.Y fill will replace the data from Mr.X.p  pSo, can I get the model ID without saving the model and How I can save the model and the method with right model ID even if there is a someone else who access the action in same timep  pthanks and sorry for my english p

Negative 854 pI have a HighCharts chart with two series plotted. Each data point can be drilled down to show a subplot a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9phfzewj21 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net9phfzewj21ap  pThe problem I have is that when I click on an xaxis label I am taken to a subplot with two series shown. The xaxis labels of this subplot only correspond to one of the series being shown, and the xaxis title and chart title also only refer to one of the series. I would like to have the xaxis labels for each series shown perhaps there could be a secondary xaxis, and also be able to correctly change the titles.p  pIs anyone able to help me to improve this and

I did not describe annotation driven since my WebApplicationInitializer looks like below.p  precodepublic class Initializer implements WebApplicationInitializer       Override     public void onStartupServletContext arg0 throws ServletException           AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext ctx  new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext          ctx.registerRootConfig.class         ctx.registerServletConfig.class          ctx.setServletContextarg0         Dynamic servlet  arg0.addServletdispatcher, new DispatcherServletctx         servlet.addMapping         servlet.setLoadOnStartup1       codepre  pI think codeAnnotationConfigWebApplicationContextcode can do same with codeannotation drivencode. I am not sure of it. I will look for it after writing thisp  pThe answer for the second, the reason why I did not implement codepersonDAOcode is I do not want to use implemented class. I have worked with MyBatis Mapper interface, so I believe Hibernate can do such interface thing. Is there no way to inject DAO without implementation in Hibernate p  pThe link I was looking is  a hrefhttpdevcrumb.comhibernatespringdatajpahibernatemaven relnofollowhttpdevcrumb.comhibernatespringdatajpahibernatemavena I am not sure it is OK to post link on herep  pand it uses Repository without implemented class.p
Negative 854 pIm quickly coming to the conclusion that I cant be a programmer. Despite taking ample notes and practicing everything in Ruby Koans up to this point on top of going through the Ruby course on Codecademy three times and currently making my way through Chris Pines book averaging 6hrs a day studying...this current Koan is an exercise in frustration and the realization that not everyone can be a programmer.p  pThe exercise is as followsp  precode Greed is a dice game where you roll up to five dice to accumulate  points.  The following score function will be used to calculate the  score of a single roll of the dice.   A greed roll is scored as follows    A set of three ones is 1000 points    A set of three numbers other than ones is worth 100 times the    number. e.g. three fives is 500 points.    A one that is not part of a set of three is worth 100 points.    A five that is not part of a set of three is worth 50 points.    Everything else is worth 0 points.    Examples   score[1,1,1,5,1] gt 1150 points  score[2,3,4,6,2] gt 0 points  score[3,4,5,3,3] gt 350 points  score[1,5,1,2,4] gt 250 points   More scoring examples are given in the tests below   Your goal is to write the score method.  def scoredice end codepre  pSo looking at everything on first glance, Im assuming the test will provide the random num functionality via codedicecode Or do I need to write that myself Now I have to limit the range the dice rolls Then all I have to do is get the numbers and put them into an array but only up to 5 positions so like codewhile array has 5 or less entriescode I then need to define how the point system works. So something like codescore[0]  100, score[2] 200code But now Ive hardcoded the scores, what if the first position isnt a 1 but is a 5 Then the number would be 50. So how about an ifelse statement something likep  precodeif score[0]  1   point  100 elsif score[0]  5   point  50 else point  0 codepre  pThen I repeat this for positions [1][4] p  pDespite wanting to very badly, I dont want to simply google the answer, Id rather get some kind of direction for lack of a better word.p  pHopefully this isnt too general of a question but how do you even approach something like this Perhaps I should go through Pines book from beginning to end first before tackling thisp

Negative 854 pI am debugging some old code joy and the issue is that restoreRow is not working at all so when the user clicks on the rows it goes into edit mode, but the user doesnt change anything and then moves on to the next row, the prev row remains in edit, rather than being restores.

Negative 854 pI have a list of Python dictionaries retrieved MongoDB documents that are heterogeneous in structure. This heterogeneity is by no means straightforward, either. All dicts will contain a certain subset of keys. Some dicts will have keys that others do not have. Two dicts may have the same keys, but the structure underneath those keys may differ. The value of one key for two dicts may be a list in each, but the lengths of the list may differ. I need to essentially flatten all of the dicts and write them to a CSV file. Here is a list of two very heavily abridged example dictsp  precode[        answers        age 25.0,       emotionindices [34.0951, 16.8922, 19.3003],       hearingimpairments False,       musicstyles [         rock,         pop,         classical,       ],       ratings          activity [4.0, 3.0, 1.0],         positivity [5.0, 4.0, 3.0],       ,     ,     timestamps        media [         datetime.datetime2012, 3, 29, 11, 18, 26,         datetime.datetime2012, 3, 29, 11, 21, 51,         datetime.datetime2012, 3, 29, 11, 24, 13       ],     ,   ,        answers        age 16.0,       emotionindices None,       hearingimpairments False,       musicstyles [         rock,          pop,        ],       ratings          activity [2.0, 4.0, 2.0, 2.0],         likedislike [1.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0],         positivity [1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0],       ,     ,     timestamps        media [         datetime.datetime2010, 7, 13, 19, 9, 50,         datetime.datetime2010, 7, 13, 19, 13, 26,         datetime.datetime2010, 7, 13, 19, 16, 2,         datetime.datetime2010, 7, 13, 19, 18, 1],       test datetime.datetime2010, 7, 13, 19, 8, 36     ,    ] codepre  pThere are solutions for flattening these, but I also see big gotchas. For instance, the first dict has a list for codeanswers.emotionindicescode, but the second has codeNonecode. A typical flattening scheme would represent the first with flattened keys like codeanswers.emotionindices.0code, codeanswers.emotionindices.1code, etc., and the first with simply codeanswers.emotionindicescode. The fact that the dicts that emdoem have codeemotionindicescode lists may have lists of varying sizes further complicates things. My data nerd friends for whom I have a deep respect would much rather see this and similar instances all represented with as many codeanswers.emotionindices.code as the longest list amongst all records for this field, and those that have either shorter lists or no lists simply show codeNAcode or similar.p  pSo, my first question is, strongis there a generic, flexible way to flatten all of these dictsstrong Or, will the process simply be full of finding all of these inconsistencies and handling them individuallyp  pMy second problem has to do with writing all of these flattened dicts to a CSV file. The codecsv.DictWritercode class handles emmissingem values for keys very flexibly. However, as far as I can tell, it does not handle emaddingem keys on the fly that were not originally specified when instantiating the codeDictWritercodep  pSo, my second question is, strongam I wrong on this, or am I stuck iterating over all of the flattened dicts first to gather keys, making the codeDictWritercode, and then iterating over all of the dicts again to write them Or, is there a better way to do this that Im not seeingstrongp  pNote that because of the amount of data Im juggling here, its very likely that I wont be able to do this in memoryIll have to retrieve the MongoDB documents, flatten the dicts, persist them to files, iterate over the files to gather keys, and then iterate over the files again after my codeDictWritercode has been setupp  pThanks for your timep
Negative 854 pIs there a way to create a multi column index across tablesp  pFor example, if I had the following tablesp  precodeFoo Table Name   FooID PK   BarID FK   FooName  Bar Table Name   BarID PK   BarName codepre  pI can do a p  precodeSELECT   FROM Foo  LEFT JOIN Bar ON Foo.BarID  Bar.BarID WHERE    FooName lt Bob   AND BarName gt Smith codepre  pIn this case, I want a multi column index against codeFoo.FooName then Bar.BarNamecode.p  pI did some googling but wasnt able to find anything, perhaps Im not using the right terms... My question may depend on the sql engine, in which case Im interested in MySQL specifically, but would appreciate info on any other engine as well. p  pDoing the multi column index on Foo with the Foreign Key doesnt help, as the underlying value of its Name is what I want for the speed.p

I installed the Facebook sdk, that in itself didnt fix the problem, but Im not sure how to proceed with wanting the button to allow the user to pick which service to use when sharing, instead of just using the facebook sdk share.p  pHeres the code Im usingp  precodeyield return new WaitForEndOfFrame     if Application.isEditor              string fromPath  jarfile  Application.dataPath  assets         string toPath  Application.persistentDataPath            string[] filesNamesToCopy  new string[]  a.txt, b.txt          foreach string fileName in filesNamesToCopy                      Debug.Logcopying from   fromPath  fileName   to   toPath             WWW www1  new WWWfromPath  fileName             yield return www1             Debug.Logyield done             File.WriteAllBytestoPath  fileName, www1.bytes             Debug.Logfile copy done                   code to open the image and share it         AndroidJavaClass intentClass  new AndroidJavaClassandroid.content.Intent         AndroidJavaObject intentObject  new AndroidJavaObjectandroid.content.Intent         intentObject.CallltAndroidJavaObjectgtsetAction, intentClass.GetStaticltstringgtACTIONSEND         AndroidJavaClass uriClass  new AndroidJavaClassandroid.net.Uri         AndroidJavaObject uriObject  uriClass.CallStaticltAndroidJavaObjectgtparse, jarfile  Application.dataPath  assets  Promo.jpg         intentObject.CallltAndroidJavaObjectgtputExtra, intentClass.GetStaticltstringgtEXTRASTREAM, uriObject          intentObject.CallltAndroidJavaObjectgtsetType, textplain         intentObject.CallltAndroidJavaObjectgtputExtra, intentClass.GetStaticltstringgtEXTRATEXT, I scored   score   in Space Drill, try to beat me spacedrill httpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.AbsinthePie.spacedrill         intentObject.CallltAndroidJavaObjectgtputExtra, intentClass.GetStaticltstringgtEXTRASUBJECT, SUBJECT          intentObject.CallltAndroidJavaObjectgtsetType, imagejpeg         AndroidJavaClass unity  new AndroidJavaClasscom.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer         AndroidJavaObject currentActivity  unity.GetStaticltAndroidJavaObjectgtcurrentActivity          currentActivity.CallstartActivity, intentObject      codepre  pAny tips or advice would be GREATLY appreciated.

Negative 854 pI should note that there are related solutions to my question online but Ive been unable to implement them into my own situation.p  pWe have an .mdb database of all the products that we make. Ive managed to take two criteria Order type and Box, and print all records containing those two criteria to Excel. What I need in addition to that now is to print 30 boxes in one go as a basis for a bigger template. The labeling of these boxes usually increment e.g. P1, P2...P30, and Im struggling to see how I can increment the numeric portion of it to fit it into my code. Ideally, Id like for the user to input the first and last box numbers in excel to represent the entire range P1 and P30 and use those two values. p  precodeSub Dan     Dim order As String     Dim title As String        initialize title     Dim palette As String      intialize comment     Dim finalpalette As String     Dim finalrow As Integer    initialize bottommost row     Dim i As Integer     Dim Cntr As Integer     Dim LR As Integer      Clears the contents of the last macro run     With SheetsALL.txt        .Range.Cells6, 2, .Cells725, 8.ClearContents equates to D2F26          row, column Erase Columns for next macro     End With      title  SheetsSheet2.RangeB1.Value     palette  SheetsSheet2.RangeB2.Value     finalrow  SheetsSheet1.RangeA2.EndxlDown.Row      For i  3 To finalrow         If Cellsi, 1  title And Cellsi, 2  palette Then             Cellsi, 5.Copy Copy ID             SheetsALL.txt.RangeB734.EndxlUp.Offset1, 0.PasteSpecial              RangeCellsi, 11, Cellsi, 14.Copy             SheetsALL.txt.RangeC734.EndxlUp.Offset1, 0.PasteSpecial              RangeCellsi, 9, Cellsi, 10.Copy             SheetsALL.txt.RangeG734.EndxlUp.Offset1, 0.PasteSpecial                 End If     Next i  End Sub codepre  pThe variable Im looking to adjust is palette. I originally used it to match records to one Box P1. What I need is to able to match records from 30 boxes P1 to P30 in the loop. The variable palette is just taking the static value of whatever is in cell B2 at the moment. Im thinking there should be some way to type the first and last box into two cells  to establish a range for the macro to iterate, or to write all the box numbers into a column and have palette move down a cell each loop to take in a new Box value.p  pIn an attempt to grab data from a column that has all 30 boxes written into 30 cells, I tried the following line of code p  precode        End If palette  SheetsSheet2.RangeB2.Offset, 1 Next i codepre  pbut it does not seem to be grabbing any value.

Negative 854 pI created a web page to login to Facebook and then once logged in, create a session which stores the access token and also the user id. And then I redirect the user to a profile page where it pulls the information from users facebook posts via a Graph API call and then presents the information. Im using PHP to get the Graph API.p  pIts working fine on my local machine and I can see the data just as I want. But when I access the same link from outside my home network, It displays a blank page. I can still login from outside the home network so that piece of code works fine, but it is unable to pull the userposts. Theres nothing wrong with the code as far as I understand otherwise I wont be able to access the link even from my local network.p  pI tried many different solutions, added a whitelist of IPaddresses but it may be that Im not adding them in the correct place. Im at a total loss. Has someone experienced a similar situation If adding the specific ip addresses would help, where do I add them exactly. There are so many confusing fields in the Facebook developers settings. p  pAny help is much appreciated.p

Negative 854 pIn this program I was required to create an ArrayList called purse which would get US coin names inputted into it as strings. Then we are asked to assign each input value to its corresponding double value. So when the user types penny the program should recognize that the string penny refers to the double 0.01. Which I have done through enums in my Coin class. Now my task is to create a new method in my Purse class that adds the double values together. Which I have almost done, but I have put the code doing task inside the AddCoin method. Since I am required to create a new method for this task I was wondering if there is a way to  do it with what I have now. p  precodepackage purse import java.util.Scanner import java.util.ArrayList        The Purse program creates an ArrayList called purse that gets printed out,   reversed, and transfered into another ArrayList called purse2.
