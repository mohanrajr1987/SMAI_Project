Positive 5608 pI need to apply my predicate to a list of lists. I heard maplist3 might be able to do this but my lists within the list may vary in length and maplist likes all the same length lists. p  pHere is the predicate I need to apply to all lists in the list. It checks if any elements in another list in the same position are the same and if they are it returns false.

Positive 5608 pI have encountered a problem I dont really understand involving lists and indexes. Code followsp  precodelistA  [1 for i in range1, 14]  def functionAnum     for i in range 1, 14         listA[i]  num  functionA1 codepre  pThis gives me the IndexError list assignment index out of range message. I added in some print statements in the space before functionA1 to help debug, and found out that the loop is completing the iteration at listA[12], but failing when it reaches listA[13].p  pI had originally set the rangea, b statements to end at 14 because I understood that that second parameter was not inclusive, and so should end at 13. How can it even try to write to the 13th index if the first line of code does not assign that index a value Can somebody helpexplain please p

Positive 5608 pI want to have a list of objects that satisfies just a few basic requirements. It needs to support fast random access and it needs to be safe to use from multiple threads. Reads will dominate by far and ideally should be about as fast as normal codeArrayListcode access, i.e. no locking. There is no need to insert elements in the middle, delete, or change the value at an index the only mutation required is to be able to append a new element to the end of the list. More specifically a caller will specify an index at which an element should be placed, and the index is expected to be only a few more than the length of the list, i.e. the list is dense. There is also no need for iteration.p  pIs there anything that supports this in Java It can be in a third party library.p  pIf not I am thinking I will implement my own class. Therell be an internal array of arrays, each twice as big as the last. Lookups by index will do just a little more maths to figure out which array has the right element and what the index in that array is. Appends will be similar unless they go beyond the available space, in which case a new array is allocated. Only the creation of a new array will require a lock to be acquired.p  pDoes this sound like a sensible approachp  pThis doesnt sound like a particularly novel data structure. Does it have a namep

Negative 5608 pstrongSummarystrong The behavior detailed below seems to indicate that if your app at www.someplace.com setsretrieves data via a SharedObject, there is some sort of .sol collision if the user hits your app at someplace.com, and then later at someplace.comnamevalue.p  pCan anyone confirm or refute thisp  phrp  pIm working on a Flex web app that presents the user with a login page.  When the user has logged in, heshe is presented with a room which is associated with a group.p  pWe store the lastvisited roomgroup combination in a SharedObject  so when a given user logs in, they are taken into the most recent room in which they were active.p  pThat works fine, but we also have an autologin system which involves the user clicking on a link to the app url with a query string attached.  There are two types of these links.  p  p1 the query string includes username, groupId, and roomIdp  p2 the query string includes only the usernamep  pBecause we are working fast and have only a few developers, the autologin system is built on the lastvist system.  During the autologin process, the url is inspected and if groupId and roomId values are found in the query string, the SharedObject is opened and the lastvisit grouproom id values are overwritten by the param values.p  pThat works fine, also, when the app is hit with a query string of the second type no groupId and roomId params, the app goes to the SharedObject to get the stored room and group id values, as it normally would.  And heres the problemp  pThe values it comes back with are whatever the last roomgroup param values were, not whatever the last lastvisit roomgroup values are.p  pAnd if the given user has never hit the app with query string that included group and room id values, the app gets null values from the SharedObject.p  pIt took some digging around, but what it looks like is happening is that a second set of data is being storedexpected in the SharedObject if a query string is present in the URL.p  pLooking at the .sol file in a text editor I see more untranslated code, and additional group and room values, once Ive hit the app with URLs that contain query strings.p  pIm not finding anything on the web about this, but that may just be due to a lack of necessary search skills.p  pHas anyone else run into anything similar  Or do you know how to address thisp  pIve tried setting Security.exactSettings to false, already  was really hoping that was going to work.p

Negative 5608 pDue to incomplete understanding of eclipse infrastructure I have one problem. Historically we have one ugly thing in our build procedure. It looks like followingbr  After eclipse builds entire workspace there is one incomplete thing in local build of plugins. It is some data file which is currently built during execution of special plugin test which is actually tests nothing, but do generation of necessary data. It isnt necessary to execute that test after any change in workspace. Actually that needed only after changes in parts of code which is touched very rarely. But if changes in that parts of code are made then the build became unusable before update of that special data file. That file is now stored on CVS since now it can be created only locally, but its necessary in product build.br  I want to change build procedure in such way that this plugin test will be executed during workspace build procedure so it will be unnecessary to have manual runs of it. Ive tried to write ant file which will run that test using templates from org.eclipse.testlibrary.xml, but the plugin didnt loaded. I dont know why this happens, but Im afraid that this can happen due to absence of test plugins in my working copy of eclipse.br  Ive read some articles about running plugin tests in batch mode, but they only strengthen my feeling about necessity of separate eclipse copy for testing developed plugins.br  Were using ant for plugin builds and the entire structure of these scripts is very complex, so I think it will be impossible to make global changes in build procedure on top level. Which options do I have to finish my task Maybe someone already had a similar experience...p  pPlease note, that in fact I want to get rid of that test in favor of some special eclipse application, but I think it isnt important right now, since I believe that my problem can be more general than running plugin tests.p

At the bottom of this post is a link to a zip of my project. Its very basic with only an outlineview and button. I want it to receive text files being dropped on it, but something is wrong with my code or connections. I tried following Apples example code of their NSOutline Drag and Drop, but Im missing something. 1 difference is my program is a document based program and their example isnt. I set the Files Owner to receive delegate actions, since thats where my code to handle drag and drop is, as well as a button action. Its probably a simple mistake, so could someone please look at it and tell me what Im doing wrong Here is a link to the file a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu7195844OutlineDragDrop1.zip relnofollowhttpdl.dropbox.comu7195844OutlineDragDrop1.zipap

Negative 5608 pI have a program that requires well formed XML for input.  As such, we have an XML schema to enforce constraints.  To make it easier for users to enter data we have used InfoPath to generate a form based on the XSD.  Now we have two issues.p  ol lipThe XML produced by InfoPath is not really user readable. The formatting is a bit random.  Is there anyway to control the way the output is written pli lipI want to do some preprocessing of data using the form.  Thanks to another stackoverflower i have a means of doing this via a text field and datavalidation, but I cannot add a new textfield to my form design that does not exist in the XSD.  I dont want to store this data though it being more of an invisible field. pli ol  pregards,p  pTrevorp

Negative 5608 pI followed Apples instructions on how to create an Ad Hoc Distrubution bundle but I keep getting what appears to be a fatal Warning during the build process.

Negative 5608 pI was using a codeBackgroundWorkercode to download some web sites by calling codeWebClient.DownloadStringcode inside a loop. I wanted the option for the user to cancel in the middle of downloading stuff, so I called codeCancelAsynccode whenever I found that codeCancellationPendingcode was on in the middle of the loop. p  pBut now I noticed that the function codeDownloadStringcode kinda freezes sometimes, so I decided to use codeDownloadStringAsynccode instead all this inside the other thread created with codeBackgroundWorkercode. And since I dont want to rewrite my whole code by having to exit the loop and the function after calling codeDownloadStringAsynccode, I made a while loop right after calling it that does nothing but check for a variable codebool Stopcode that I turn true either when the codeDownloadStringCompletedcode event handler is called or when the user request to cancel the operation. p  pNow, the weird thing is that it works fine on the debug version but on the release one, the program freezes in the while loop like if it were the main thread. p

Negative 5608 pThe recommended practice of using codereintegratecode is generally understood by me.

Both A and B have Thunderbird set as their default mail client.p  pHowever, the state of the registry is not as I expected itp  pOn machine A, both codeHKLMSoftwareClientsMailcode and codeHKLMSoftwareWow6432NodeClientsMailcode have an empty string as the default string value. On B, both those keys contain codeMicrosoft Outlookcode as the default string value, which is clearly wrong.  Further investigation revealed that the correct value seems to be written to codeHKCUSoftwareClientsMailcode on both machines.p  pI want my application to handle this correctly for all cases. It makes kinda sense, that Win7 now seems to hold a separate default mail client for each user, but it appears rather inconsistent. When looking at the plethora of information that points to codeHKLMSoftwareClientsMailcode, it seems obvious that previous versions of Windows handled this differently and always wrote to that location. So when did this change Has the wrong value on machine B any meaning If not, why does it get written there in the first place Does the mix of 64bit and 32bit email clients on the same computer change anythingp  pI would most appreciate if anyone would share reliable information or documentation that explains this topic Maybe there is a Win32 API function that returns the correct valuep

Negative 5608 pI have a simple HTML5 video player in a hideable codeltdivgtcode for use on iOS devices for watching MP4 videos. If the user closes the player or, in reality, hides it, I really want to kill the video entirely, preserving the users bandwidth. The only method for halting video that I know if is codevideoElement.pausecode, which does stop the video from playing, but from watching network stats it looks like the video continues to load until the entire file is complete. Ive also tried codevideoElement.currentTime  videoElement.durationcode, but that also seems to have no impact on the buffering video.p  pIs there a way to kill the download Or is this just a straight HTTP file transfer that JavaScript has no control overp

Negative 5608 pI am new in designing a ETL process. Currently I have two database, one is the live database where the application use it for every day transaction. The other one is the data warehouse.p  pI have a table in the live database that regularly have new data insert into it. The goal is that every night the ETL Process will transfer the data in the live database to the data warehouse, follow by deleting the data in the live database.p  pDue to my lack of knowledge, the solution that I got is to implement something call a rolling table. Basically on the live database, I have two tables that have the same structure. I call them emtblLive1em and emtblLive2em. I also has a synonym call emtblLiveem. All insert is done on the synonym. The synonym would point at one of the table.p  pWhen I run the ETL process, I have a stored procedure that would drop and create a new synonym that point to emtblLive2em. This allow the ETL process to transform data from emtblLive1em without effecting the application.  The assumption is that the ETL Process takes an hour to run, and I wont want the ETL process lock the table preventing the application insert new data to it.p  pThis solution should theoretically work, but not elegant.p  pI am sure this problem is a common problem, are there any other solutions out therep  pThanksp
Negative 5608 pI am developing an extension for Mozilla Thunderbird to encrypt messages in the inbox.Are there any API calls in Thunderbird for reading from or writing to messages in the inboxp  pI was going to encrypt all the messages with AES encryption and then I realised that it would change the size of all the messages because AES uses a block cipher which is a fixed size. This would mean I would have to update the index file separately. Before I reach that level of complexity I would like to be able to write a ceasar cipher.p  pAny help on Thunderbird email message IO would be greatly appreciated.p  pFrom, Hugh.p

For example Registration class is to be executed first followed by ManageProfile class.p  pThese fixtures are very easy to achieve with TestNG, but TestNG can only be used with java. While working on Selenium test with C I came across NUnit. But I suppose these fixtures are not possible with NUnit and I also understand that NUnit is unit testing framework and not for integration testing. But then is my selection of Nunit wrong or I am just not aware of how these features could be leveraged in NUnit.p

There is no diff mode that retains my data and patches model changes.

Negative 5608 pI have a table PatientChartImages. It has a column ChartImage, which contains the binary of images. Now, we are planning to create a separate table which will contain the Binary of Images and will join both the tables to get requisite data. Now, we do not want to change the front end and I cannot use triggers. So, is there any way by which if a query refers to ChartImage column of PatientChartImages, it picks data from the third table Please suggest.p
Negative 5608 pIm trying to write a C program that utilizes a few tens of thousands of lines of Fortran 77 code, but running into some strange errors. Im passing three coordinates x,y,z and the address of three vectors from C into fortran, then having fortran run some computations on the initial points and return results in the three vectors. p  pI do this a few hundred times in a C function, leave that function, and then come back to do it again. It works perfectly the first time through, but the second time through it stops returning useful results returns nan for points with a positive x component. p  pInitially it seems like an algorithm problem, except for three thingsp  ol liIt works perfectly the first 200 times I run itli liIt works if I call it from fortran and eliminate C altogether not viable for the final programli liIve tried adding print statements to fortran to debug where it goes wrong, but turns out if I add print statments to a specific subroutine even something as simple as PRINT ,Here, the program starts returning NaNs even on the first run.li ol  pThis is why I think its something to do with how memory is being allocated and deallocated between C and fortran functionsubroutine calls.

Negative 5608 pI am interested in using the LLVMs Clang compiler.  LLVM claims to be crossplatform however it is not clear which platforms can be targeted.  I have done quite a lot of Googling on this but there doesnt seem to be much information about LLVMs supported platforms.  The only thing I did find was a hrefhttpllvm.orgdocsGettingStarted.htmlrequirements relnofollowthisa which is kinda confusing.  I am not sure if it means I can compile binaries for those platforms using LLVM or if it just runs on those platforms or both.  Could someone who knows more about the LLVMClang compiler tell me which platforms I can target using Clang or any other LLVM front ends  I want specific information like It supports Windows 32bit, Windows 64bit, Linux 32bit, Linux 64bit, etc.  Thanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOk, I think I am just confused about what LLVM really is. From what I just figured out LLVM is simply a bytecode interpreter.  Since LLVM is interpreted how much slower is LLVM binaries compared to executable binaries  So if performance is important LLVM is not the right choice  a hrefhttpllvm.orgFeatures.html relnofollowHerea I found the architectures it supports but it did not say what operating systems it supports.  Does it run on all operating systems if I avoid platform dependent code  I will look for more articles that explain LLVM in more detail if I can find any.p

Negative 5608 pIm trying to use codeistreamiteratorcode for reading characters from codecincode. Ive read that pressing codeCtrlDcode sends an codeEOFcode character which ends the input stream. Unfortunately, something is going wrong with it. Heres my codep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltiteratorgt int main    using namespace std    istreamiteratorltchargt itcin, eos   while it  eos clog ltlt it  codepre  pIm running it and typing codeas dfcode, then pressing kbdCtrlDkbd. It outputs only codeasdcode without the last codefcode and then hangs waiting for input. When I type codeghcode and press kbdCtrlDkbd again, it prints the remaining codefcode at last, and the codegcode from next input, but again without the last codehcode. And when I finally press kbdCtrlDkbd without typing anything, it prints the remaining codehcode and exits.p  pI expected it to read codeasdfcode and exit, since I already pressed kbdCtrlDkbd at the end of this first sequence.p  pWhy is it still waiting for input after getting codeEOFcodebr Why it doesnt print the last character read before codeEOFcodebr And why it exits only when I press kbdCtrlDkbd without typing anything beforebr How does this loop need to change to make it behave in the way I expect i.e. stop reading immediately after getting kbdCtrlDkbd sequence in the input, no matter I typed anything before or not, and reading emallem characters up to the codeEOFcode.p

Negative 5608 pIm writing a webapp that basically allows users to kick off shell scripts with parameters they enter through various forms. After doing some research I believe ProcessBuilder to be the best way to run the shell scripts, however Ive got some conditions that I need to meet and was hoping some others could tell me if Im thinking along the correct lines.p  pThe scripts that will be kicked off can literally take a few hours to run. So obviously I cant have the app pause and wait for that long. So Im wondering if threads is the answer to that problem Im not very experienced with using threads and looking for some advice. Should I kick off the ProcessBuilder in a new thread so that the main web app will continue to run Will that even work Is it as simple as just declaring a new thread and assigning the process builder to it Do I have to worry about having various threads running or created Just not sure of what to be on the look out for or what pitfalls to keep aware of.p  pAlso, I really need a way to be able to at least check on the status of the process once it is running. The requirements call for some way to show how far along the process is, but I dont know that that is possible. I believe being able to at the very least show that it is still running should be acceptable. How would I go about detecting thatp  pFor some more info its a JavaSpring web app and will be running on some flavor of Unix. Thanks for any thoughts and help.p

Negative 5608 pI need to do simple singleblock AES encryption  decryption in my Qt  C application. This is a keep the honest people honest implementation, so just a basic codeencryptkey, datacode is necessaryIm not worried about initialization vectors, etc. My input and key will always be exactly 16 bytes.p  pId emreallyem like to avoid another dependency to compile  link  ship with my application, so Im trying to use whats available on each platform. On the Mac, this was a oneliner to codeCCCryptcode. On Windows, Im getting lost in the API from codeWinCrypt.hcode. Their example of encrypting a file is almost 600 lines long. emSeriouslyemp  pIm looking at codeCryptEncryptcode, but Im falling down the rabbit hole of dependencies you have to create before you can call that.p  pCan anyone provide a simple example of doing AES encryption using the Windows API Surely theres a way to do this in a line or two. Assume you already have a 128bit key and 128bits of data to encrypt.p
Negative 5608 pI use Lion, have the latest xcode installed. So I believe that I have llvm, clang, and gcc4.2because in xcode I can use them. Then I installed eclipse for c developers, after that I installed plugins llvm4eclipsecdt, and a set of plugins for parallel applications development ptp. Ok. I built my code in eclipse. When I try to run it, it returns error codeLaunch failed. Binary not foundcode, although I specified codeMatchO 64 Parsercode in options. Perhaps, I should have specified where to find llvm as well. In the debug folder there are files .bc. I suppose it means llvm binary codes. I try codellv main.bccode but llv is not found However, clang is installed and there are some strange files in the same folder like llvmgcc4.2 another front end for llvm, llvmg and so on. So where can I find llvm which I can use in console and specify this path in LLVMs plugin options in eclipsep

Negative 5608 pI am facing two options of how to update the database, and do not know which one is better for my situation. There are three tables in the database, which are used to readstore some users information, such the url history or some inputs. In real time, the database is accessible by users all the time, so the changes made to the database can be seen immediately by that user. The batch processing hides the update from user, database is updated by parsing the log files, and such a process runs every X hours. So user can only see their changes after X hours.p  pApart from the advantagedisadvantage of synchronizedasynchronized updates that user can see. What are the other benefits of choosing realtime or batch processing updating methods for database updatingp  pThanks p

I validate the query input to prevent some type of attack and I see that the query is malicious so I put a validation error.p  pWith the old functions, I have a form instance empty and I put data in it and validation errors if needed. I always return that instance, if empty first request or if it filled with errors the case of the malicious query.p  pThe problem is with classbased views. In my get method I work with an extra instance of emSearchFormem so if I put validation stuff would be there and if I call emgetem on the emfatherem it will use the instance on formclass that would be empty.p  pSo, I think that there should be a way where I use the same form always, I mean I call the request method, I pick the formclass not create a new form, pass the data, validate and the father will return that form with the validation stuff.p  pIm not sure if I explained this correctly. So in short, Im creating a copy of the form in the get but I return the emfather getem who have another copy that will be empty, so my when I display the template, there will be no errors because the form sended is empty.p  pAny ideas Thanks.p

To do that, we run the same suite of tests through MSTest but we change the app.config file between each run to setup the browser to be used.p  pThe problem is that in the MSTest Report page in Cruise Control, we see the three test runs but we are not able to see which browser is used for each test run.p  pIdeally, I would like to do something like passing the name of the browser as a parameter to MSTest so that it writes it into the trx file but I didnt see any possibility for that. The only thing Im thinking about is giving a specified output name for the trx file and then use a Powershell script to change the xml inside this file.p  pDo you have a better ideap

Negative 5608 pI have an existing application that I wanting to add some automated integration testing to.  This is a .NetSQL Server application with all data access managed through stored procedures.  The stored procedures may or may not contain business logic.  It seems most efficient to buildout our test base is by adding a tests for bugs as they are reported and resolved.  So, each test will be dependent on a very specific set of data that may be spread across multiple tables in multiple databases.  If the databases were small, we could simply spin up a copy of the databases containing the test data for each test before it runs and delete the database after the test finishes.  However, in total these databases are too large to copy and store in their entirety for every.  The subset of data actually used by each test would be manageable.  In total there are 8 databases.  The smallest is 200 MB the largest is 10 GB with the other 6 falling in between.p  pGetting the right subset of seems key to this process.  I dont have much experience with SSIS, but Im pretty sure we could create a predefined package that packages up the subset of data needed for the test.  The problem with this approach is that our applications covers many different functional areas and it seems daunting to build packages that cover all the scenarios needed for any given test.p  pAnother option that seems ideal on the surface anyway would be to create a logging framework that could record all the data used by a stored procedure some of our stored procs have multiple select statements from multiple tables.  So when were ready to create the data for our test case, we could simply turn on logging and run the test logic against the fullcomplete set of databases.  Then take the log of the records accessed during the run across all the databasestables and create the smaller test specific databases from the log.  This log could be actual data or it could be a series of select statements we then use to get the actual data.  Is this too tall of an order     p  pAny advice on how to approach this situation would be helpful.p

Negative 5608 pIm taking my first babysteps in learning functional programing using F and Ive just come across the Forward Pipe  and Forward Composition  operators. At first I thought they were just sugar rather than having an effect on the final running code though I know piping helps with type inference.p  pHowever I came across this SO article a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5671271whatareadvantagesanddisadvantagesofpointfreestyleinfunctionalprogra56715525671552What are advantages and disadvantages of point free style in functional programminga Which has two interesting and informative answers that instead of simplifying things for me opened a whole can of worms surrounding pointfree or pointless style My takehome from these and other reading around is that pointfree is a debated area. Like lambas, pointfree style can make code easier to understand, or much harder, depending on use. It can help in naming things meaningfully.p  pBut my question concerns a comment on the first answer AshleyF muses in the answerp  blockquote   pIt seems to me that composition may reduce GC pressure by making it more obvious to the compiler that there is no need to produce intermediate values as in pipelining helping make the socalled deforestation problem more tractable.  p blockquote  pGasche replies p  blockquote   pThe part about improved compilation is not true at all. In most languages, pointfree style will actually decrease performances. Haskell relies heavily on optimizations precisely because its the only way to make the cost of these things bearable. At best, those combinators are inlined away and you get an equivalent pointful versionp blockquote  pCan anyone expand on the performance implications In general and specifically for F  I had just assumed it was a writingstyle thing and the compiler would unstrangle both idioms into equivalent code.p

Now I cannot.p  pIt seems like I have a few options... I could wrap the whole thing in another query, repeating the projection with just the added activity. It seems like I may be able to use WITH a CTE in the same way.p  pBut because I dont understand clearly the rules of when I can and cannot use a subquery the way I want to, I could easily be missing something.

Also, RE the log function  Im working to combine with with relevance as a weighted total, so thats a workinprogress.

Negative 5608 pIve been having major issues with trying to compile projects so Im going to start fresh. I have several header files. Some header files use other header files they are containers. The files are all given to us by the professor for our class with no explanation on how to include them in our projects. Now Im only able to get it to work if I put the header file code within the .cpp file which isnt what I want. I keep getting a link 2010 unresolved error in the tmainCRT start up. I dont want to fix what I have I just want to create a new project and start over, and copypaste the code from the header files I need into newly created header files.p  pThis is the functionality I seek I want to have a light weight main .cpp file to test out code I create that uses these header files. I want to be able to use multiple header files, and in some cases, use a header file as a container for another header file. An example is that I would have two header files, Vector and SList, and Vector is the container for SList. I need someone to explain it in a clear and concise manner because all of the resources Ive found are not useful. I do NOT want to use a precompiled header.p  pedit Some other questions that may or may not be related to the linker error, so I am asking them here in case you feel they might cause an issue. The reason why I am including these additional questions here is that from the resources Ive found online, there are several different causes for linker errors. Since Im not sure which one it could be, Im explaining here what was confusing when I tried reading through these resources, and also advice from another programmer who claimed that multiple inclusions could cause linker errors, but he does not usually use C or visual studio so Im not sure if they actually are a problem If my questions are not related to the linker error, then you can ignore them.p  pIn some cases, I have my class functions declared within the class, and then I define them afterwards using something like thisp  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt VectorltTgtVectorconst VectorltTgt ampob  array  new T[ob.size] for int  0 i lt ob.numberofitems i     array[i]  ob.array[i] size  ob.size numberofitems  ob.numberofitems  codepre  pWould these go before or after the endif in my header filep  pAre there issues that arise from multiple inclusions If I need iostream in a header, but also need it in my main C, do I need to remove this inclusion from one of the files Here is an example. MyString.h uses iostream in some of its function definitions, but Vector.h does not need this inclusion. I test my Vector.h class using an int, and I need to include iostream to see my results. Now I need to test Vector.h with my MyString.h class. Would it cause problems if I do not remove the include  from my main cpp file after including the vector classp  pCan you please explain what steps I need to follow to ensure the successful build of a project with many header files Thank you very much.p

Negative 5608 pOk, I have a large multidimensional JSON object being poured into my app, of which one of the objects is an html string, for creating links. Now I have no ability to change the output of this Object currently to replace what I want to with what I need to because this object is used in a couple places through out a few different applications. Of which works fine up til now.p  pWhat I need to do is replace a small piece of this html string in the JSON object to alter it so it fits the needs of this new application.p  pThe HTML within the object looks like taken directly from firebug console under response tab less the whole object datap  precodelta hrefngotherobjectid6bfb00fb2b76gtSome Textltagt codepre  pWhat I need to do is replace the ng and other within that string to something else entirely.

Negative 5608 pI am following this style Tables are named in singular nouns. How would you name a join table then Would you keep the naming such as codequestiontestcode if it was two tables codetestcode and codequestioncodep  pAnd would you add something like codejoincode so that you wont use the codequestiontestcode if you need it later for a normal table So codequestiontestjoincodep  pAnd the last question is if it is a convention to keep the names in join tables sorted alphabeticallyp
Negative 5608 pI am working on redesigning a database for a product called Project Billing. I am having trouble coming up with table names. In the old database, the names were super obscure codePRBPROJLVLcode, so old is of no help. The database is small  10 tables or so  but will grow over time.p  pHeres the problem  codeProjectscode are an entity and table, but the word is also used as an adjetive. Examplep  ul licodeProjectcode  a table containing projects.li licodeProjectTaskcode  a table containing project tasks this is a child of codeProjectscode.li licodeProjectTemplatecode  a table for project templates, which is strongnotstrong a child of codeProjectscode.  Project templates just serve as a model for creating a bunch of codeProjectTaskscode.li ul  pSo, how do I show that codeProjectTaskcode is a child of codeProjectcode but codeProjectTemplatecode isnt  Thanks as always.p

Negative 5608 pI have a Pyramid app using Mako templates and am wondering if it is possible to serve static HTML pages within the appp  pFor the project Im working on, we want to have relatively static pages for the public frontfacing bits, and then the application will dynamically serve the meat of the site. We would like one of our internal users to be able to edit some of the HTML content for these pages to update them.p  pI have my static folder that Im serving CSS and scripts from, but that doesnt seem to really fit what Id like to do.  I could create views for the pages and basically have static content in the mako templates themselves but I think the application would need to be restarted if someone were to update the template for the changes to appear  Maybe thats not the casep  pLong term I would probably do something like store the content in a db and have it dynamically served but thats outside of the scope at this time.p  pIs there a reasonable way to accomplish this or should I not even bother and set up the public pages as just a regular static HTML site and just link to my app altogetherp  pThanksp

So something like this is straightforwardp  precodepublic IEnumerableltProductgt GetProductsByCategoryint categoryId codepre  pBut it is more complicated when our EF4 Select method is producing a more complex, customised anonymous type  there is no generated class corresponding to the result.p  pBecause this function has to cross the tier boundary Business to UI, I had thought that the appropriate solution would be to define a custom type for this query and then return an IEnumerable of that type  e.g.p  precodepublic IEnumerableltProductAccountSummarygt GetProductAccountSummariesByCategoryint categoryId codepre  pwhere codeProductAccountSummarycode is a handcrafted DTO i.e. POCO.p  pHowever, during code review, the Team Lead failed my approach hes asked me to delete the DTO and change the method signature top  precodepublic IEnumerable GetProductAccountSummariesByCategoryint categoryId codepre  p....The reason being that we can still bind the IEnumerable to our UI grids etc. without the overhead of handcrafting a DTO every time we need to use a custom type.p  pSo my question isp  ul liIn EF4, whats the typical approach for passing collections of custom types across tier boundaries  Returning an IEnumerable implicitly, of object just doesnt seem right to me. Am I missing somethingli ul

Negative 5608 pI am using the Google a hrefhttpcode.google.compreflections relnofollowReflections librarya for querying certain resources in the classpath. Those resources are located in the same location than the classes in my project.p  pI wrote some unit tests that succeed when executed as a unit test in Eclipse, but when I try to execute them with Maven with a codemaven installcode for example, they are not working as expected.  After some debugging, apparently the problem is that when executed with Maven, the Reflections library cannot find the classpath url where the resources are located.p  pI arrived to that conclusion researching how Reflections determines the classpath URLs that should be inspected. As an example, the following method shows how Reflections finds the available classpath URLs given a class loader the original Reflections method has been simplified a bitp  precodepublic static SetltURLgt forClassLoaderClassLoader... classLoaders      final SetltURLgt result  Sets.newHashSet     for ClassLoader classLoader  classLoaders          while classLoader  null              if classLoader instanceof URLClassLoader                  URL[] urls  URLClassLoader classLoader.getURLs                 if urls  null                      result.addAllSets.ltURLgtnewHashSeturls                                            classLoader  classLoader.getParent                   return result  codepre  pIn short, it is traversing the class loader hierarchy asking for the URLs of each individual classloader. p  pWhen in Eclipse I invoke the previous method from a unit test with something like thisp  precode    ClassLoader myClassClassLoader  ltMyClassgt.class.getClassLoader ltMyClassgt is in the same classpath url than the resources I need to find     SetltURLgt urls  forClassLoadermyClassClassLoader     forURL url  urls        System.out.printlna url   url codepre  pas expected, I can see among many other URLs the classpath URLs that are configured as part of my projectp  precodefileltMYPROJECTPATHgttargetclasses fileltMYPROJECTPATHgttargettestclasses codepre  pand Reflections works as a charm the resources Reflections should find are located in codefileltMYPROJECTPATHgttargetclassescode.p  pHowever, when the test is executed by Maven, I realized that these URL entries are missing from the set returned by the codeforClassLoadercode method, and the rest of the Reflections methods are not working as expected for this problem.p  pThe surprising thing is that if I write this when the unit test is executed by mavenp  precodeClassLoader myClassClassLoader  ltMyClassgt.class.getClassLoader url  myClassClassLoader.getResourceanExistingResource System.out.printlnURL url a valid URL codepre  pI can see that the class loader still can resolve the resource I am trying to find.  I am puzzled about why when executed with Maven the codeforClassLoadercode method does not include in the returned set the classpath URLs of my project, although at the same time it is able to resolve resources that are located in such urls.p  pWhat is the reason of this behavior Is there any workaround I can try to make the Reflections library work when invoked as part of a unit test run by Maven p

Also, it crashes only if the LLVM compiler optimization is set to Fast or above. p  pThe code above will get and remove an object from an NSMutableArray, put it back, and then get another object from the array. emThe code above will run without crashingem, but if I scan across all the elements in the array later e.g., from a different method, then it crashes. It looks like a random memory address was added to the array probably from the above call to addObject. p  pThe above block should do nothing, but if I change it then theres no crash later. E.g., empty block  no crash. Dont declare block as myBlock  no crash. If I dont repeat the loop, theres no crash. If I dont add the object back, theres no crash. If I declare currentTile using block or within the do loop, theres no crash.p  pI know blocks are stacklocal, but this block doesnt do anything And it runs fine without compiler optimization. p  pAny idea whats going onp  pEDIT 12512 Someone asked for the crash log. Im running in the simulator, so I dont know how to get that.

Of course, I can use constructor injection, but then I usually end up having to create an additional fake noargs constructor just for proxying.

Negative 5608 pI have a php script that leads up to running another expect script by passing it arguments.p  precodeoutput  shellexecexpect loginscript.tcl user host port password codepre  pUsing shellexec doesnt work as the script gets run in the background or within the php script. I need it to run in the foreground, allowing user interactivity. Is there an elegant way to do this. Already it is getting messy by having to use different scripting languages. I tried wrapping the two scripts with a shell script that called the php script, assigned output the result as a variable which was a command and then ran sh on that. However I have the same problem again where the scripts are run in the background and any user interactivity creates a haltfreeze. Its ok in this situation if php quits out when calling shell exec. Ie. php stops and expect gets run as if you called it. the same as if i just copied the command that is output and pasted it into the terminal.p  hr  pUpdate I am having much more luck with the following command in phpp  precodeshellexecgnometerminal e bash c expect commandsloginscript.tcl exec bash amp codepre  pHowever, can this be improved in order to not close the shell immediately after the secondary script loginscript is finishedp  hr  pFurther Updatep  pFrom reading the answers I think I need to clarify things as it looks like people are assuming a more complicated issue.p  ul lipthe two processes do not need to communicate with each other, I should probably not have put the codeoutput  shellexeccode in the example and just codeshellexeccode on its own as I believe this has led to the confusion.pli lipThe php script needs to only initiate the expect script with some cli parameters, e.g. myscript param1 param2 and can be thought of as completely asynchronous. This is much like the behaviour of launcher programs like launchy or synapse they can launch other programs but need not affect them. Nor do they wait for the secondary program to quitfinish.pli lipI made the mistake of saying shellexec doesnt work for me.

Negative 5608 prelatively simple question that I am struggling to find a nice elegant solution to. I have a grid with a column that displays values that update every n seconds.

File type could be any plaintext, office document, etc. I am on Linux Mint with Mate.p  pIm stuck cant reliably detect if file was closed in application so that script can proceed to encrypting it back and removing decrypted version.p  pThe first version of the script simply used vim with text files. Script was calling it directly and hadnt been going any further until vim was closed. Now as I want to be able to do so with other files, I tried the following thingsp  pxdgopen exits immediately after calling the application associated with file type. Thus script continues and does no good.p  pxdgopens modified function for calling an associated app runs it inside the current script so now I see program exit. Works only if the application hasnt been running already. If it has, then new process is finished and script continues.p  pSo what I am trying to do now is to watch somehow that file was closed in already running application. Currently experimenting with plumagedit and inotifywait. It doesnt work either  instantly after file was opened it detects iCLOSENOWRITE,CLOSEi event.p  pIs it at all possible to detect this without specific hooks for different applications Possibly some X hooksp  pThank you.p

Negative 5608 pI want to know if there is any proper way to add timer for task schedule it will be count up in Spring 3  Tiles that works accurate. I have tried many options like jquery timer  Client side Quartz Server side Threading, But though it is not accurate and somewhat we can say it is bad practice for web application. What I exactly want want to manage is in my Web applicationSpring 3  Tiles, When user Click on Timer start, It should be started at client side and timer should be continued until user click on stop, however user could do any other things Like navigation to any other pages in web application but timer should be working in static way. There are many issues as if only I implement timer at client side using cookies ,jquery session client side than I have to manage if user navigate to another page then again timer will have to start from previous time that has been stored in cookies but doing this results in loss of seconds during request response processes.So I tried also to implement server side timer using quartz but again I have to sync it with client side timer at every click in web application . So again it is bad practice what I feel. So Is there any thing that I can introduce in Spring 3  tiles  that can be static and can hold timer in static way.  p  pThanx in Advance.  p

Negative 5608 pI understand that Java Interfaces are used for declaring methods that will be used in more classes as those classes implement them.

Negative 5608 pIm relatively new to coding, and Id like to make a test program which can take an input, and output it as an anagram. But the anagram cannot just be a jumble of letters, it needs to be a comprehensible word of sorts i.e. if I put in dinosaur, I want to get something along the lines of nisadoru in return as opposed to something like dsrunsia. If taking things a step further isnt too much of a stretch, Im also interested in having the program add an extra letter to the output i.e. if I put in dinosaur, I could receive nisadorux. p  pIm not looking for a choice of extra letters to be added to the word, I want the letter I choose to be added. The letter, if it matters, is x. So all anagrams would contain an additional x. p  pIve looked hard, but failed to find any useful help. I havent any code to go off, but for those of you saying I wont learn from being simply given the code, I prefer to look over a complete piece and deconstruct it or figure out how everything works as opposed to trying to put together various things as a test. p

Negative 5608 pI am currently working on a project where users will be entering C scripts that get dynamically compiled and executed. I will skip giving more details for now as I will probably have questions about other aspects of the project later.p  pDue to some higher level decisions that are out of my control, the user interface will be developed using WPF and the Quantum Whale Editor.NET control will be used as the editor. Sadly, it seems that the WPF version of the QWhale Editor.NET is still not fully mature and so it is lacking documentations and, worst, it does not seem to be binding friendly.p  pWhile I am still new to WPF, I am somewhat familiar with MVVM and so I would love to apply that. However, I was faced with the first challenge when I was testing the evaluation version and tried binding the editors text to a property of a model and received an exception that it is not possiblep  blockquote   pA Binding cannot be set on the Text property of type TextEditor. A Binding can only be set on a DependencyProperty of a DependencyObject.p blockquote  pHaving tried AvalonEdit while checking the alternatives, I remembered this other Stack Overflow question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12344367makingavaloneditmvvmcompatibleMaking AvalonEdit MVVM Compatiblea. And so I followed the same concept.p  pI have defined a class that inherits from the editor, added a dependency property and at first tried combining that with hiding the original codeTextcode property of the editor using codenewcode. But obviously that was a long shot and my property was not used, the base property was being called directly.p  pOnce that failed, I defined a brand new property called codeDocumentTextcode. I had it wrap codebase.Textcode, defined the binding using it and accordingly got one direction of binding working. That being from the model to the control. But from what I found, the best way to get binding working in the other direction is to codeoverridecode the codeOnTextChangedcode event or an equivalent to have it raise the property changed notification. The problem is that the control does not have such an event, as weird as that sounds.p  pNow I could probably override a bunch of other events e.g. OnKeyUp, OnMouseClick, etc. so that I could handle all possible actions that could modify the text typing, drag amp dropping, pasting, etc. but that does not seem too practical and might not be repeatable to other properties that I might be interested in binding later on. And after a couple of days of searching online when I find the time, I am still no closer to finding other ideas. So, are there any proper solutions to my issue short of diving into the code of the control itself Supposedly, the license will give me access to the source code, but I would rather avoid direct modifications to that.p  pI have avoided specifying the QWhale editor in the question title and tags as I have felt that what I am looking for does not depend on this specific control. Please correct me if I am wrong.p  pI cannot provide my testing code at the moment due to being on a different computer, but if you think it is necessary just leave me a note and I will add it.p  hr  pUpdate Here is the code, because I am not sure that I managed to clearly describe my issue.p  precodeclass ExtenEdit  TextEditor      public static DependencyProperty TextProperty          DependencyProperty.RegisterText, typeofstring, typeofExtenEdit,             new PropertyMetadataobj, args gt                              TextEditor target  TextEditorobj                 target.DocumentText  stringargs.NewValue                            public new string Text              get  return base.Text          set                      if base.Text  value                              base.Text  value                             codepre  pThat works when I modify the value in the codeViewModelcode, but when typing in the editor my property gets bypassed and the base property is called directly.

Negative 5608 pSuppose I have an application which fetches a custom XML packet from the server which represents a dataset. Then, suppose I wish to execute a SQL statement on that data via a dataset. What can I use to do this I dont need to know the code necessarily, but just what to use to make this possible and a general explanation of how.p  pFor example, I may fetch a list of customers in XML format from the server. Then, I can use any thirdparty parser to dump that XML data into some client dataset. Then, execute a query on that dataset, for example codeselect  from customers where ZipCode  12345code without fetching this data from the server again.p  pXML is not the only limitation, thats just an example. I might want to do the same to some application settings loaded from an INI file. Either way, the concept is that the original source of the data is unknown.p  pWhether the dataset stores its temporary data in the memory or on the disk doesnt matter, but it would be excellent if it could keep it in the disk.p

The script itself is actually run as an old Windows Command line script in both cases, so checking for GetChildItem will always yield an error.p

Our problem however stays unsolved as 1 there is lots of code that require amount of time to adapt every part to use codeDecimalcode. Furthermore, 2 there is significant slow down in the performance. In addition it requires 3 massive changes while dealing with codenumpycode arrays. Thus it is not useful for our cases. We are thinking on some sort of decorator etc. without changing things and also keeping codenumpycode performance preserved. BTW, some may suggest multiprecision packages such as gmpy etc., note that they require lots of adaptation in the code which is not helpful for our case so.p

Negative 5608 pI have a VDProj project which I use to create a setup program for my application. Ive had to install Visual Studio 2010 on another machine to allow me to run this, as it has been removed from VS2012.. very annoying.. but thats a different thread.p  pWhen the end user installs the program, it creates the files in the cprogram filesmycompany folder, which inherits the security from the parent directory, which has no write access for the user.p  pThe problem is, that when my program runs, it creates some log files, and also does a software update if required. So my application requires write access to the directory.p  pIm guessing that I could install the software into the MyDocuments folder, or another folder which has write access, but was wondering if theres a better way of doing thisp

Negative 5608 pI am working on a node.js application using express to serve content and socket.io for websocket communication. The setup has been working fine, but now I want to be able to access the websocket via SSL, too. I thought using nginx which we already used for other stuff as a proxy was a good idea, and configured it like thisp  precodeupstream nodejs      server 127.0.0.18080   server      listen 443 ssl     sslcertificate etcnginxsslserver.crt     sslcertificatekey etcnginxsslserver.key      servername       location           proxyhttpversion 1.1         proxysetheader Upgrade httpupgrade         proxysetheader Connection upgrade          proxysetheader XRealIP remoteaddr         proxysetheader XForwardedFor proxyaddxforwardedfor         proxysetheader Host httphost         proxysetheader XNginXProxy true          proxypass httpnodejs         proxyredirect off       codepre  pThe node.js server is set up like thisp  precodevar express  requireexpress,     app  express  some app configuration that I dont think matters server  http.createServerapp.listen8080 var io  requiresocket.io.listenserver io.configurefunction      io.setmatch original protocol, true     io.setlog level, 0     io.setstore, redisStore  creation of redisStore not shown  codepre  pBoth nginx and node.js run inside a Vagrant box which forwards port 443 which nginx listens on to port 4443 on the host system.p  pWith this setup, navigating to codehttplocalhost4443code using Firefox 23 gives me access to the files served by Express, but when socket.io tries to connect to the socket, it throws the following errorp  precodeBlocked loading mixed active content httplocalhost4443socket.io1t1376058430540 codepre  pThis outcome is sadly obvious, as it tries to load the JS file via HTTP from inside an HTTPS page, which Firefox does not allow. The question is why it does so in the first place.p  pSocket.io tries to determine which protocol is used to access the web page, and uses the same protocol in the construction of the above URL. In this case, it thinks it is being accessed over HTTP, which may be the result of being proxied. However, as I understand, setting codematch original protocolcode to codetruecode in the socket.io config is supposed to help in situations like this, but it does not in my case.p  pI have found numerous questions and answers here about websocket proxying, but none that deal with this particular issue. So Im pretty much at wits end, and would really appreciate some advice.p

Negative 5608 pI am working on a windows store application and I want to be able to drag between buttons so that the originally pressed button becomes deactivated and the newly dragged onto button becomes activated but I cant seem to get this to work.p  pI have 2 Buttons inside a StackPanel and the events I have on them arep  ul liPointerPressedli liPointerEnteredli liPointerReleasedli liPointerExitedli liPointerCanceledli liPointerCaptureLostli ul  pPointerPressed and PointerEntered share the same event handler and the rest the deactivation events share the same event handler.p  pIf I press one button my activated event handler is triggered and if I drag off it my deactivated event handler is triggered but if I then drag onto the second button the activated event handler isnt triggered again.p  pStrangely, if I start by dragging from off the StackPanel onto one of the buttons the activated event handler is triggered. I assume that it is something to do with the internal pointer management stuff but cant seem to find a workaround.p  pDoes anyone know why this is happening and how I can get it to work how I wantp  pThanks for your time.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pOkay Ive been researching some stuff and Ive come across CapturePointer and ReleasePointerCapture but this seems to be broken  If I capture the pointer, when I take my finger off the screen, PointerReleased doesnt even get hit.p  pIve also realized why the dragging from off the SP onto one of the buttons causes it to activate  this is because when a button is pressed it doesnt route its event but fires a Click event  meaning the same pointer cannot fire a PointerEntered event of another button, but if it starts outside a Button it will trigger PointerEntered.p  pThis doesnt get me much further but it is a little extra info p

Negative 5608 pthis is a duplicate of a post I wrote on UnityAnswers, but I was advised to go here instead because my problem was too complicated XDp  pI am building a emsort ofem modding system for a certain aspect of my game in Unity3D.br It basically allows the common user to write some C code which will be used to give access to certain elements of the game at certain times. Like giving the host of a multiplayer server the ability to decide what map to load with what parameters etc...p  pFor those of you who dont know, Unity uses .NET 2.0 with Mono, so this question is less specific to Unity and rather more towards C and .NETp  pI already have the assembly loading working. Its quite neat and not very complicated XDbr But now Ive come to the point where it would be very nice if I could give the emuserem some access to assemblies such as codeSystemcode and codeUnityEnginecode.br I could of course include the emdllems in the codeReferenceAssembliescode property of the codeCompilerParameterscode, but that would give them access to possibly harmful functionality, such as emreflectionem, emInstantiateem, emDestroyem as well as many others...p  pHow would I limit the assembly references to only certain namespaces, such as codeSystem.IOcode and codeSystem.Collectionscode, without giving access to codeSystem.Reflectioncodep  pNow for the posting of some possibly relevant codep  precodeExcuse the UnityScript...

Negative 5608 pIm assuming the answer is obvious, but I am new to coding and cannot find a clear answer.  p  pHere is why I ask  I have a Fastball class in a baseball game, which has 10 unique sets of data 10 difficulty levels for a pitched fastball, and 1 blank set of data.  When an object is constructed from the class, it sets the blank set of data to 1 of the 10 data sets based on the difficulty.  Note, there is only 1 fastball object at any one time.p  pI am worried that all 10 of the data sets in this class will remain in Javas memory, even though only 1 is being used.  Is this a legitimate concern  Or is the object the only thing that is kept in memoryp

Negative 5608 pI researched quite a bit before posting this, and I did implement a workaround that I dont like.  I tried Hibernates Filter and FilterDef annotations with little success, and I didnt like that option much anyway because it made my persistence layer dependent upon the provider framework.  I am including one hibernate specific annotation in here, though, so my solution is not completely devoid of frameworkspecific code. p  pBasically, I have a Person class with family members that contains a collection of other Persons.  I want to archive my data, and basically never physically delete anything, so all major objects in the app have a boolean deleted value. p  pMy basic problem was that I could not figure out a JPA query for filtering the familyMembers collection where I would only retrieve those family members that have not been deleted from the database. p  precodeEntity Tablenameperson class Person      private boolean deleted      private ListltPersongt familyMembers      ManyToManytargetEntityPerson.class, cascade CascadeType.MERGE, CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REFRESH , fetchFetchType.LAZY     JoinTablename  hppersonfamily,          joinColumns   JoinColumnname  personid , inverseJoinColumns   JoinColumnname  familypersonid           LazyCollectionLazyCollectionOption.FALSE     public ListltPersongt getFamilyMembers          return familyMembers           Columnname  deletedflag     Typetype  yesno     public boolean isDeleted          return deleted        codepre  pIn my service implementation, I had this p  precodeString personQuery  SELECT DISTINCTp FROM Person p           LEFT JOIN FETCH p.familyMembers pf            WHERE p.deleted  false              AND pf.deleted  false  ListltPersongt people  em.createQuerypersonQuery, Person.class          .getResultList  codepre  pWhich only returned those people that had a nonempty familyMembers collection, and only those that had not been deleted. p  pNext, I tried p  precodeString personQuery  SELECT DISTINCTp FROM Person p           LEFT JOIN FETCH p.familyMembers pf            WHERE p.deleted  false  ListltPersongt people  em.createQuerypersonQuery, Person.class          .getResultList  codepre  pThis gets too many things ... all nondeleted people, but their familyMembers could have been deleted and they would still get retrieved. p  pMany syntax errors arose as I tried different ON statements and other asinine combinations that I desperately knew wouldnt work, but tried anyway. p  pFinally, I used the second version, and then used a Predicate object to filter the resulting familyMember collections.  I get the results I want, but it means iterating through the collection bring on the Lambdas in JDK1.8 after retrieving it, just to filter out the baddies. p  precodeString personQuery  SELECT DISTINCTp FROM Person p           LEFT JOIN FETCH p.familyMembers pf            WHERE p.deleted  false  ListltPersongt people  em.createQuerypersonQuery, Person.class          .getResultList   filterPeopleResultspeople      private void filterPeopleResultsListltPersongt people      if people  null  people.isEmpty  return      forPerson person  people          removeDeletedFamilyMembersperson        private void removeDeletedFamilyMembersPerson person      if person.getFamilyMembers.isEmpty  false           Predicate predicate  new Predicate              Override             public boolean evaluateObject obj                  if Personobj.isDeleted  return false                  return true                                CollectionUtils.filterperson.getFamilyMembers, predicate       codepre  pIve considered the possibility of pushing this logic up to the application level since I would only filter those Person objects I actually want to work with.  Are there any other options I have using JPA, or some other clever JPQL syntax that would give me what I want p

Negative 5608 pThere is a standard hash function where we take the mod from the key in order to define the address. That is, hk  kmod p where p is some prime number.This is called the division method. I have seen a variation of this division method where you first multiply the key by a prime and then you take the mod. For example hk  k17 mod 11. What is the purpose to multiply the key by a prime 17,37... before calculating the mod  is it to improve the distribution of the keysp

Ive got it so that the label icon changes to user input image but obviously there arent any boundaries which means if an image too big is chosen it just gets clipped. Is there another easy way to display the image Or a way to resize the iconp  pThe code im using to replace the icon is below, the shorter the better really. I was hoping to simply draw a frame and make the background the image therefore every user chosen image could be exactly the same size and would look much better on the GUI.p  pThanks in advancep  precodeprivate void jButton1ActionPerformedjava.awt.event.ActionEvent evt                                                   int img  jFileChooser1.showOpenDialogthis         ifimg  jFileChooser1.APPROVEOPTION              File f  jFileChooser1.getSelectedFile             jLabel1.setIconnew ImageIconf           codepre

Negative 5608 pThere is a domain whose purpose is a reconciliation process between a pretty large number of companies. The process communicates via request and notification messages, each transferred via webservice SOAP requests. Each company has to provide an own SOAP endpoint in order to receive request messages and they must send notifications in the role of a webservice client.p  pThe specs at hand describe the process and there are XSD and WSDL files describing the interface.p  pstrongMy preferred approachstrong to design a participating implementation was to look at the domain, work out an ubiquitous language based on the specs and create a domain model. Id like to implement the domain as agnostic in respect of infrastructuretechnology as possible, read while targetting Java EE, JPA Id like to keep infrastructure dependencieslibraries out of the core domains code.p  pWhen I apply this approach I can achieve a domain model thats pretty good aligned to the language of the specs. At the current point Im even convinced that it is really expressive regarding details that are quite blurry in the specs. However its a fact that the domain model differs quite a bit from the webservice model described by XSDs.p  pstrongPlease notestrong Its very likely that the future users and operators of the system assumed to be domain experts and scattered throughout all the participating companies out there will have debates oriented towards the requests and messages on the SOAP interfaces. So there will be the constant requirement for translation between these two models, e.g when a user of my system talks to a developer, when someone does look at the database directly, ...p  pA strongsecond feasible approachstrong could be to force an hard alignment between webservice, domain model and persistence. One could use HyperJAXB3 to map classes generated from the XSD to the persistence layer. Due to the fact that I used Embedded in my handcrafted model where appropriate and I simplified and unified some model elements theres quite a difference in the number of resulting database tables, about factor 5. This makes the XSDbased DB schema harder to grasp.p  pSo my simple question is should I strive for an alignment between webservice, domain model and persistence in strongemthisemstrong domain because the communication is at the very heart or should I continue with  my preferred solution of handcrafting a more expressive domain modelp  pReferences are welcome.p

Negative 5608 pI am investigating the pubsub pattern because I am reading a book that highly advocates event driven architecture, for the sake of loose coupling.  But I feel that the loose coupling is only achieved by sacrificing readabilitytransparency.p  pIm having trouble understanding how to write easilyunderstood pubsub code.  The way I currently write my code results in a lot of onetoone channels, and I feel like doing so is a bad practice.p  pIm using require.js AMD modules, which means that I have many smallersized files, so I feel like it would be very difficult for someone to follow the flow of my publishes.p  pIn my example code below, there are three different modulesp  ol liThe UI  Controller module, handling user clicksli liA translator moduleli liA data storage moduleli ol  pstrongThe gist is that a user submits text, it gets translated to english, then stored into a database.strong  This flow is split into three modules in their own file.p  precode Main Controller Module define[pubSub] functionpubSub       submitButton.onclickfunction          var userText  textArea.val         pubSub.publishuserSubmittedText, userText          Translator module define[pubSub] functionpubSub       function toEnglishtext           Do translation         pubSub.publishtranslatedText, translatedText           pubSub.subscribeuserSubmittedText, toEnglish      Database module define[pubSub] functionpubSub       function storetext           Store to database           pubSub.subscribetranslatedText, store   codepre  pFor a reader to see the complete flow, he has to switch between the three modules.  But how you would make clear where the reader should look, after seeing the first codepubSub.publishuserSubmittedText, userTextcodep  pI feel like publishes are like a cliff hanger, where the reader wants to know what is triggered next, but he has to go and find the modules with subscribed functions.p  pI could comment EVERY publish, explaining what modules contain the functions that are listening, but that seems impractical.  And I dont think that is what other people are doing.p  pFurthermore, the above code uses onetoone channels, which I think is bad style, but Im not sure.  Only the Translator modules codetoEnglishcode function will ever subscribe to the pubSub channel codeuserSubmittedTextcode, yet I have to create the new channel for what is basically a single function call.  While this way my Controller module doesnt have to have Translator as a dependency, it just doesnt feel like true decoupling.p  pThis lack of function flow transparency is concerning to me, as I have no idea how someone reading such source code would know how to follow along.  Clearly I must be missing something important.  Maybe Im not using a helpful convention, or maybe my publish event names are not descriptive enoughp  pIs the loose coupling of pubsub only achieved by sacrificing of flow transparencyp

Negative 5608 pIm trying to paste some code into one of my blog posts. I am doing so by wrapping the code in the codeltpregtcode tags because I want to maintain formatting. I am aware that Twenty Thirteen is a fixed width template and as such the codeltpregtcode tags still get squished and formatting gets broken.

Negative 5608 pI am dinamically generating a layout which requires to use relative sizes, the only way I found to do it without using an external Java layout library is GridBagLayouts weightx and weighty.p  pAt this point it has been working exactly as I need with one small exception. When I have one column containing two JPanels with a space distribution of 66.6 and 33.3 respectively and then another column with 3 JPanels using 33.3 of the space each one of them, the 33.3 of the first column is not the same as the 33.3 of the second. I need them to be perfectly aligned.p  pUnfortunately this is my first post and I am not able to post any pictures, I hope I wont get in trouble for doing the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comavsuA.png alti.stack.imgur.comavsuA.pngp  pI think I know what the problem is, inside of each JPanel I have one JLabel and since weightx and weightys definition is Weights are used to determine how to distribute strongspace among columns weightx and among rows weightystrong I guess the difference between the two 33.3s is the fact that the second column contains one extra JLabel.p  pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15600565gridbaglayoutfixspacesetbyweightxythis threada StanislavL says that the container asks children for their preferred size, so, I am wondering if the solution is to override JLabels getPreferredSize method.

Negative 5608 pI have a requirement that the user can provide arbitrary statements which can be stored in a function and called later to get a return value. A simple example of this is that codeuserInputcode might bep  precodevar x  10 x codepre  pI would store this viap  precodevar callback  function      return evaluserInput  codepre  pand then running codecallbackcode returns code10code as expected.p  pHowever, I also need to support the case with an explicit return statement, ie codeuserInputcode might bep  precodevar x  10 return x codepre  pIn this case the eval method above will fail with codeSyntaxError return not in functioncode. Instead I could store callback asp  precodevar callback  new FunctionuserInput codepre  pMy issue is that I would like to combine these two approaches according the rule get explicit return value otherwise get the result of the last executed statement.

This doesnt work for my last example, see a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netZGb6z2httpjsfiddle.netZGb6z2a  out4 should be codenocode but ends up being undefined as the last executed statement is not returned.p  pAnother suggestion is to modify the user input to add an explicit return on the last line if one is not found. Unfortunately its not possible to know which statement will be executed last. Considerp  precodevar x  10 switchx    case 10     100     break   default     200     break  codepre  pWhen called it should return code100code, but it would take some serious analysis to determine where to put returns for arbitrary code.p
Negative 5608 pI was thinking of ways to have my laptop HDD backed up safely, and still being able to put the backup rapidly in use if needed.

Negative 5608 pHello all and thanks in advance for any help you can offer p  pFirst off, Im not super strong in scripting so I need all the help I can get. p  pIve seen similar questions on the web but I cant seem to find one that fits my needs close enough for me to modify with my skill level.p  pWhat I need is a batch script that will give me a list of subfolders from 2 known folders in different locations which will exist for multiple user accounts on a machine, and then present that list of folders as a selectable menu to choose from to remove the folder. I would also like an option to remove them all at once, and if possible, since it will be common to have the same folder on multiple users accounts, to be able to remove that same folder from all accounts that it may exists on instead of having to run the script multiple times to remove it from each individual user account. These folders are temp folders for application testing and need to be removed from time to time in order for changes to be seen correctly. And I only need the subfolder names not any files in them.p  pExamplep  puser1folderAtargetfolderA user1folderBtargetfolderBp  puser2folderAtargetfolderA user2folderBtargetfolderBp  puser3folderAtargetfolderA user3folderBtargetfolderBp  pThanks again. Any help is greatly appreciated, Ryanp

Negative 5608 pWe have several apps Deployed on Google Apps Marketplace using OAuth 1.0 protocol. According expiration OAuth 1.0 in Google Platform we are trying to migrate all the apps to new OAuth version but we are facing some difficulties regarding background request to Google Admin SDK Directory API. p  pIn our apps we need to request for Domain user accounts, groups and other stuff related Email Domain structure. Until OAuth 1.0 we have been doing this with 2LO TwoLegge OAuth so basically once Admin gave us access we can impersonate request for domain using this mechanism.p  pAfter reading all Google Documentation about Google API, Oauth Mechanisms and stuff, and after trying some code test hypothesis too, we havent figured out yet how can we managed the same concept with OAuth 2 because of the followingp  ol lipUsing strongWeb Serverstrong Oauth 2 Strategy simply will not work because in that scenario we would be getting a Domain user Access to Admin SDK. If we keep their accessrefresh token pair to later querying Admin SDK and the user is deleted because Domain change it Admin we will be disconnected from flow.pli lipI supposed in that case the best choice was strongService Accountstrong strategy.

Negative 5608 pThis question might seem very poor, but still I want to know the answer. Because for the first time I am using Flurry.p  pWhenever I go to Flurry dashboard and try to download the SDK, it asks me to select and application. The app which I select has some category such as gamearcade, applifestyle etc.p  pAs per my knowledge an SDK is universal for all types of applications games. It just differs with application Ids. p  pIf I am correct why they ask me to select an application for downloading SDK Does Flurry SDK different for each application p  pIf SDK is universal, Flurry must change its SDK download option. It is very annoying and confusing.p
Negative 5608 pI am new to angularjs so I may be taking the wrong approach but here is my situation.  I have an MVC3 app but I am only using Mvc to serve up a layout page and the script and css files.  In that view I have a ngview tag.  Here is my routeProviderp  precoderouteProvider.when,  templateUrl templatessearch.html, controller SearchController .         whenSearch,  templateUrl templatessearchResults.html, controller SearchController  codepre  pSo initially the search.html template is going to load which is nothing but a form and Search button.  The user enters whatever form data they want to search by and click Search which is tied to a function scope.search that gets the form data and call WebApi to get the results.  The function returns a promise, and .then I want to assign the results to the scope and then load the searchResults.html template by calling codelocation.pathSearchcode The problem is when that is called it reloads the controller and the scope is wiped out.p  pI want to do this without using the MVC framework.  I know angular takes a new way of thinking and I think my problem lies there.  Can anyone guide me to where I should be going with this   p

Negative 5608 pIm writing the logic portion of a game, and want to create, retrieve, and store values integers to keep track of progress.  For instance, a door would create the pair codelocation.room.doorlockcode, code0code in an stdmap, and unlocking this door would set that value to code1code.  Anytime the player wants to go through this door, it would retrieve the value by that keyname to see if its passable.  Just an example, but its important that this information exist outside of the door object itself, as characters or other events might retrieve this data and act on it.p  pThe problem though is that the name or map key itself is far larger than the data its referring to, which seems wasteful, and feels wrong as a result.p  pIs there a commonly used or best approach for storing this type of data, one where the key isnt so much larger than the data itself  p  pIt is possible to know how much space to allocate at compile time for the progress data itself, if its important.  It need not use stdmap either, so long as I dont have to use raw array indices to get or store data.p

Negative 5608 pI have an Executable I am able to run in the Dev environment that isnt being run in the Int environment. When I try to run the .EXE on Int remotely using UNC path I get an error stating the .EXE is a 16bit application and cant be run on the Int machine. The problem with that error is I built the .EXE and know for a fact it isnt a 16bit application. When I try to run the SSIS package to call the .EXE on Int I do not receive the 16bit error, but the .EXE is not run. p  pI have tried hard coding the location of the .EXE in the execute process task and using a variable that dynamically sets the location based on the machine I am running the SSIS package on. Both work in Dev, neither work in Int I can also call the .EXE on Int from Dev, which isnt a surprise since the .EXE is pulled down from Int to Dev.p  pAny ideas why the .EXE would run on a Dev environment but not an Int environment The environments are the same per our System Admin.p

This means that when the listening loop begins, it will crash due to the missing required resources. The problem finding the acoustic model bundle could be because the name of the bundle was not given to this method in a way it can use for instance, if you are trying to use the English acoustic model and you have added that bundle to your app project, you would invoke this method by passing code[AcousticModel pathToAcousticModelAcousticModelEnglish]code or code[AcousticModel pathToAcousticModelAcousticModelSpanish]code for the Spanish bundle, without appending .bundle to the end, and making sure that the bundle name is spelled exactly as it appears in the actual bundle name the bundle can be seen in this distributions folder Framework. p  pIf this doesnt fix the problem, it is very likely to be due to the fact that the acoustic model bundle wasnt imported successfully into the root level of your app project and its mainBundle. This usually happens either because the acoustic model bundle was never dragged into your app project when the Framework folder was originally supposed to be dragged in, or because it was dragged in but instead of using the setting Create groups for any added folders in Xcodes Add Files dialog, the option Create folder references for any added folders was unintentionally chosen. To fix this, just remove the acoustic model bundle or the Framework folder from your app and add it again to your app project with the correct setting of Create groups for any added folders in Xcodes Add Files dialog.p  pI also get these messages in my syslogp  precodeMay 27 005449 PhillipsiPhone SpringBoard[17785] ltWarninggt acousticModelPath is null May 27 005449 PhillipsiPhone SpringBoard[17785] ltWarninggt Error the default phonetic dictionary nullLanguageModelGeneratorLookupList.text cant be found in the app bundle but the app is attempting to access it, most likely there will be a crash now.

Negative 5608 pI am trying to test a Spring Web Service which is currently secured with Basic Authentication underneath. For these tests, I have written a Web Service client using Springs codeWebServiceTemplatecode class.p  pMy Web Service client calls to the Web Service work okay when I create the templates MessageSender as a codeorg.springframework.ws.transport.http.CommonsHttpMessageSendercode object bean with codeorg.apache.commons.httpclient.UsernamePasswordCredentialscode and, although the client works, the code has a warning highlighted saying that the codeCommonsHttpMessageSendercode class is now deprecated and that I should be using codeHttpComponentsMessageSendercode instead.p  pI have tried reconfiguring the clients codeWebServiceTemplatecode to work using the newer codeHttpComponentsMessageSendercode class, but I am unable to have the basic auth part configured correctly with it. For the new codeHttpComponentsMessageSendercode class, I have created credentials using the codeorg.apache.http.auth.UsernamePasswordCredentialscode class but, when I make a call to the Web Service, the credentials seem to not be available with the request Is there a working example of a WebServiceTemplate client anywhere that uses these newer classes for authenticating requests, etcp  pJars that my working code with old deprecated classes uses codecommonshttpclient3.1code,  codespringwscore2.2.0.RELEASEcode.p  pJars that my NONworking code with newer classes uses codehttpclient4.3.4code,

Negative 5608 pIn my model checking code, Im only interested in finding the maximum value of a certain variable. The procedure I employ now is to have an assert statement codeassert var lt MAXVALUE code, and keep changing the MAXVALUE in a binary search fashion.

Negative 5608 pI am currently studying a doctoral thesis in control theory. At the end of every chapter there is a simulation of a relativewiththesubject problem. I have finished the theory,but for further understanding I would like to reproduce the simulations. The first simulation is as follows p  pThe solution of the problem concludes in a system of differential equations whose right hand side consists of functions with unknown parameters. The author states the following  We will use neural networks with one hidden layer,sigmoid basis functions and 5 weights in the external layer in order to approximate every parameter of the unknown functions.More specifically, the weights of the hidden layer are selected through iterative trials and are kept stable during the simulation. And then he states the logic with which he selects the initial values of the unknown parameters and then shows the results of the simulation.p  pCould anyone give me a lead on where to look and what I need to know in order to solve this specific problem myself in MATLAB since this is the environment I am most familiar with Because the results of a google search are chaotic since I dont really know what Im looking for.p  pIf you need any more info,feel free to askp

Negative 5608 pI am new to brew and have been using it to great effect until now.  I am trying to install pygame, and it is not letting me get past one of the dependencies, codesdlttfcode. I am running OS X 10.9 Mavericks.  The bottom line is that I have now downloaded and successfully installed the package myself but brew still keeps asking for it and failing.  p  pFrom my perspective I have installed the dependency, so brew should let me proceed in the first place.  One option is to convince brew that I have the dependency.  Another option is to help brew install it again so it is happy.  I dont know too much about make, but brew seems to be failing in the codelibtool link clangcode section.

So each tenant gets a subdomain on our app like a hrefhttpclienta.ourapp.com relnofollowhttpclienta.ourapp.comap  pSo this is the problem.p  pWe had a client sign up and they picked their subdomain to be a hrefhttpplans.ourapp.com relnofollowhttpplans.ourapp.comap  pThe client does not have any problems except when they try to access our path ThingsPlans. when they do that we get an error. Its one of our own exceptions and it happens because on every request we determine who the tenant is by looking at the subdomain.p  pfor some reason when we examine the domain name routing has stripped out the plans part of the sub domain name and is http .ourapp.com instead of a hrefhttpplans.ourapp.com relnofollowhttpplans.ourapp.coma.p  pSo this is obviously caused by the fact that the word strongplansstrong is the subdomain and plans is also the end of the route ThingsstrongPlansstrongp  pWe need to somehow avoid this happening, maybe the route is not setup properly or maybe its just a bug but would be great to figure out exactly why this is happening so we can fix it.p  pThanksp

Negative 5608 pfolks,p  pI am new to Java. I have seen including external jars and compile that. External jars usually contains lot of class files. So when I include these external jars in my project and if I create a new JAR, I can see these external jars included as part of my JAR file. p  pBut I have seen cases in which these external jars are not included as part of my JAR file when using strongMavenstrong  Why is it like that  Example, when you write hadoop map reduce programs in java, you are referring lot of external jars but none of these external jars are included in the final jar I create from my project.p  pthanks, Johnp
Negative 5608 pI have an application with one activity one fragment class and five viewgroups. To start with I pass the first viewgroup to my fragment class and when a certain area in the viewgroup is touched a call is sent up to the activity to notify it that the next viewgroup should be loaded. I call getFragmentSupportManager.beginTransaction then replace the old fragment with the next one using  fragmentTransaction.replaceR.id.primaryContainerView, currentFragment, Title  Some of my viewgroups have up to 20 images associated with them and the background for each is being set using  imageView.setImageResourcemContext, R.drawable.myImage The first time I run my app everything works great but sometimes on subsequent runs it throws an outofmemory exception.  Some of the ImageViews use pictures up to 1733x1017 because theyre background images and several of the Viewgroups have their backgrounds replaced before sending a call to 5 he main activity to load the next viewgroup. How can I make sure my images are recycled properly so I dont get the outofmemory p

Negative 5608 pI know this problem is kind of common, but i literally tried everything to solve this error and i didnt come up with a solution.

Negative 5608 pIm using spring security in a grails app and when a login fails it always redirects to loginauthfailajaxtrue and a json is rendered.p  pI even tried to redefine the ajaxAuthFailUrl to be the same as defaultFailureUrl, but even though it redirects to loginauthfailloginerror1 I still getting the same json.p  pI dig the spring plugin to see why it thinks its an ajax request. Then on SpringSecurityService.java I put some debug messages on isAjax method. The result was, first of all, it calls isAjax 2 times in a row. And the request is considered an ajax for different reasons there is a header ajaxHeader there is an ajax parameter on the request and finally when it checks the SavedRequests headers, it also finds it to be an ajax call.p  pI confess Im lost, I dont have a clue about how to try to fix it...p  pIm using Grails 2.3.8 springsecuritycore2.0RC4 runtime springsecurityacl2.0RC1 and I have a custom authentication handler that is set on BootStrapp  precodeauthenticationProcessingFilter.authenticationSuccessHandler  new MyUrlAuthenticationSuccessHandler codepre
Negative 5608 pWebsocket Or XMLHttpRequest Or I have to do it myselfp  pSo I understand the client has to send it, but when and why Suppose I use the XMLHttpRequest object to send a normal HTTP GET.  I have no control over how long that internal tcp connection in the browser lasts, right And if I want to use websockets I have to use their own websocket classes anyway, so for me as a user, upgrading is not visible, is it  Its just the browser that is doing some internal magic to reuse a connection, the whole upgrade process is irrelevant for me as a user I still have to use two different classes, I just happen to use the same port and the browser then decides for performance reasons to upgrade. Is that really correctp

Negative 5608 pusing JPA 2.1 is it possible to map a many to many relationship which carries attributes on the junction table while the object layer has those attributes on one side  For examplep  precodeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb.ThoroughfareAddress    ID BINARY12 NOT NULL,   AddressNumber INT NULL,   AddressNumberSuffix VARCHAR10 NULL,   StreetNamePremodifier VARCHAR45 NULL,   PRIMARY KEY ID  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb.Person    ID BINARY12 NOT NULL,   FirstName VARCHAR45 NULL,   LastName VARCHAR45 NULL,   PRIMARY KEY ID  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb.AddressType    Type INT NOT NULL,   ShortName VARCHAR45 NULL,   LongName VARCHAR255 NULL,   PRIMARY KEY Type  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb.PersonThoroughfareAddress    PersonID BINARY12 NOT NULL,   ThoroughfareAddressID BINARY12 NOT NULL,   AddressType INT NULL,   Comment VARCHAR255 NULL,   PRIMARY KEY PersonID, ThoroughfareAddressID,   INDEX PersonThoroughfareAddressFK1idx ThoroughfareAddressID ASC,   INDEX PersonThoroughfareAddressFK3idx AddressType ASC,   CONSTRAINT PersonThoroughfareAddressFK1     FOREIGN KEY ThoroughfareAddressID     REFERENCES mydb.ThoroughfareAddress ID     ON DELETE NO ACTION     ON UPDATE NO ACTION,   CONSTRAINT PersonThoroughfareAddressFK2     FOREIGN KEY PersonID     REFERENCES mydb.Person ID     ON DELETE NO ACTION     ON UPDATE NO ACTION,   CONSTRAINT PersonThoroughfareAddressFK3     FOREIGN KEY AddressType     REFERENCES mydb.AddressType Type     ON DELETE NO ACTION     ON UPDATE NO ACTION codepre  pOr more simply, you have a Person table, a ThoroughfareAddress table, an AddressType table with entries for things like home, work etc, and a junction table connecting Persons to ThoroughfareAddresses and also carrying the AddressType.  So the type is on the junction entry, allowing for things like one concrete address being a work address for one person, while it is a home address for another.p  pMeanwhile this is modeled in Java with a Person object having a set of ThoroughfareAddress objects, and the AddressType is an attribute of the ThoroughfareAddress class.  So it has been collapsed into the instance.  p  precodeEntity public class Person      Id     ColumncolumnDefinition  BINARY16, length  16, updatable  false, nullable  false     private byte[] id     private String firstName     private String lastName     private Set ltThoroughfareAddressgt thoroughfareAddresses   Entity public class ThoroughfareAddress      Id     ColumncolumnDefinition  BINARY16, length  16, updatable  false, nullable  false     private byte[] id     private String addressNumber     private String addressNumberSuffix     private String streetNamePremodifier     private AddressType addressType     private String comment   public enum AddressType      PRIMARY,     OTHER  codepre  pI cant see how to map this model to that schema.  I can see how it would work if the object model included a class for the junction table, but it doesnt.

I have disabled a mouse wheel plugin its running to check if its that and it has no effect on the iPhone 5 issue. Normal layout pages are fine.p  pthe url is a hrefhttpwww.pjrundle.co.uk relnofollowhttpwww.pjrundle.co.ukap  pThe problem occurs on any of the photography pages.p  pSorry if this is a really obvious newbie question. Here is the css for the div containing the side scrolling gallery. I tried removing absolute positioning and no effect.p  precode.scroll  whitespace nowrap backgroundcolor white paddingtop 73px position absolute left 0px  codepre  pAny advice greatly appreciated.p  pThanks.p
Negative 5608 pSo heres what im trying to do with my text based rpg now. I want to clean up my codemain.cppcode so that it isnt so long and cluttered, so I am creating a few different cpp files that will hold related items. p  pI have a codemaketoon.cppcode file that will go through some switch statements that will set all the modifiersstr, int, agl, maxhp based on the class they chooseclass being like lumberjack doctor etc not classes in the object sense of things.p  pwhen setting the variables in the maketoon.cppwithin a function called codemakeMainPlayercode  i use setters that i made within my codecreatecharacter.hcode file. p  pSo before you look at my code below, i have a few questions. p  p1Where should i create the objectcodemain.cppcode, codemaketoon.cppcode.  Currently i was creating the object codePlayercode in the maketoon.cpp file but im getting these errorsp  precode Build Debug in 6daystoescape compiler GNU GCC Compiler  C...maketoon.cppIn function int makeMainPlayer C...maketoon.cpp5error startChoices was not declared in this scope C...maketoon.cpp6error name was not declared in this scope C...main.cppIn function int main C...main.cpp39error Player was not declared in this scope  Build failed 3 errors, 0 warnings 0 minutes, 0 seconds  codepre  p2Should i capitalize the first letting in my object name 3how do i call makeMainPlayer in my main.cpp so set that specific objects values to then start the game 4Lastly, when i was testing to see if the setters and getters were working, i was getting another codePlayer not declared in this scopecode error, so i tried just banging out another codeCreateCharacter Playercodeat the start of my int main, but i feel that will overwrite all the values set in the later functions, with the default null values. p  pAlso. I know nothing about pointers, but if that is the best way to gosome google searches popped up with this as a fix to similar scenarios p  pSeriosly thanks a ton Im trying to teach myself OOc and it is proving difficult.

Negative 5608 pThis will be the first time I ask a question to anyone in regard to web development. The reason why I decided to ask this question, spite many similar questions asked before by others, is because the answers that others received in the past came in great quantity and subjectivity, so I became confused and doubtful as to how to approach it. p  pI realize that there are different ways to approach this, which is why my question may cause some discussion, but I would like everyone to remember the specifics of my question, should any discussion arise That Im not asking for what is the most secure approach, but whether my approach is secure at all, or not Im aiming for the security level of popular forums, not large company websites such as Amazon or Paypal where money transactions take place. p  pWhat I usep  ul liPHP 5.5 for passwordhashli liPDO wprepared statementsli ul  pstrongREGISTRATIONstrongp  pAll inputs are cleaned with the followingp  ul litrimli listripslashesli lihtmlspecialcharsli ul  pand they must pass through pregmatch.p  pThe user must choose an account name and a nickname. The account name is used to login with, whereas the nickname is used to communicate with others on the forum. These two names cannot be identical with each other, nor can they already exist in the database. p  pThe user is asked a random question to check if its human or not. p  pstrongLOGINstrongp  pAll inputs are cleaned with the followingp  ul litrimli listripslashesli lihtmlspecialcharsli ul  pand they must pass through pregmatch.p  pAn IP address can only attempt to log in once per minute, to a total of 3 times per hour, before the user will have to wait for 24 hours to attempt to log in again. p  pWhen account name is not found, or password is wrong, they receive the same message that either could be wrong. p  pUpon successful login a function is called, which creates a random 32 character long string, using characters ranging between em0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.,em. This function will then loop this string through all the user rows in the database until it can no longer find an identical string, then pass the string and place it in the accounts name under SID1, before the same function is called again and another 32 character long string is placed under SID2. p  pWhenever the user logs in, a new set of strings are made.p  pstrongSESSIONstrong p  pSESSION sessionstart is not used. COOKIE is for remember me. So I apologize if Im using the wrong terminology by referring to it as a session or as a SID. p  pThe two 32 character long strings that were placed in the database are merged and placed in a cookie under the same name. This 64 character long string is from then on the only measure of identifying the user. Whenever the user needs permission to do something, such as viewing a particular forum, or editing his account settings, these two 32 character long unique IDs explode are used to call the database and return the users rank. In other words, the user id and account name is never used to call the database with, only the unique IDs in the users cookie is. Before these strings are used to identity the user, however, it has to pass through a pregmatch, just in case theres any unforseen way of tampering with the input from the cookie I dont know whether there is or not, which is why I decided to take that precaution. p  pThe cookie is set to destroy in 4 weeks, unless the user did not set remember me upon login. p  pWhenever the user is logged out, the cookie is destroyed by setting it to 1 year. p  pstrongPOSTINGstrongp  pUsers are allowed to post any UTF8 character they want, and this one input only has to pass through htmlentities before it is stored in the database. Passing scripts does not seem to work this way. They can write codeltscriptgtalerthelloltscriptgtcode and it will appear that way in the post but the script will not run. But if I attempt to clean the output, instead of input, the script will run. Though, I may not know all the ways to pass scripts. So, enlighten me if you can think of any, or maybe Ill just have to find out the hard way. p  pIve made it so that if the user writes an URL in their post the URL is automatically put into an a href. Likewise, images are put into img, and YouTube videos are put into iframe. Next step is to only allow one image and one youtube video per post, but I think Im going to have to find out how caching works because my sites response time went from 0.25 seconds to over 3 seconds as soon as posts contained external imagesvideos. I will probably have to check external images whether theyre really images or not to avoid hostile code hiding in the image but Im not sure yet how that works maybe the best way to find out whether the URL is an image or not is to check whether its an image so Ill probably have to rewrite all of it. p  pExcept for SSL, Im not quite sure what else I can do to secure my site, or whether my loginregistrationsessionposting approach is in any way good enough. p  pPlease let me know if Ive missed something. p

Here is what I have right now, everything seems to be ok and I do manage to get all the input fields. But for some reason values of every input field seems to be undefined, does anyone know whyp  precodedocument.onclick, izmena, function     function          var collectionA  .crtezInput         var datas  []         .eachcollectionA, functionidx, obj              datas.push input obj.findinput.val                   .eachdatas, functionidx, obj               crtezNaziv  obj.input ,                   console.logcrtezNaziv              codepre  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv idizmenacrtezagt     ltdiv classheadlineagtCrteziltdivgt     ltdiv classcrtezformgt         ltinput typetext stylewidth80 marginbottom10px classformcontrol upisstyle crtezInput placeholderNaziv valueGlavni izgledgt           lti titleObrisi Arhitektu stylemargintop 18px classfa fatimes fa2x deleteArhgtltigt         ltinput typetext stylemargintop20px width80 marginbottom10px classformcontrol upisstyle crtezInput placeholderRazmera value1100gt         ltinput typetext stylewidth80 marginbottom10px classformcontrol upisstyle crtezInput placeholderTehnika valueTusgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classcrtezformgt         ltinput typetext stylewidth80 marginbottom10px classformcontrol upisstyle crtezInput placeholderNaziv valueIzgled sa stranegt          lti titleObrisi Arhitektu stylemargintop 18px classfa fatimes fa2x deleteArhgtltigt         ltinput typetext stylemargintop20px width80 marginbottom10px classformcontrol upisstyle crtezInput placeholderRazmera value1100gt         ltinput typetext stylewidth80 marginbottom10px classformcontrol upisstyle crtezInput placeholderTehnika valueTusgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classcrtezformgt         ltinput typetext stylewidth80 marginbottom10px classformcontrol upisstyle crtezInput placeholderNaziv valuePresek abgt           lti titleObrisi Arhitektu stylemargintop 18px classfa fatimes fa2x deleteArhgtltigt         ltinput typetext stylemargintop20px width80 marginbottom10px classformcontrol upisstyle crtezInput placeholderRazmera value1100gt         ltinput typetext stylewidth80 marginbottom10px classformcontrol upisstyle crtezInput placeholderTehnika valueTusgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre

Negative 5608 pHaving extensively looked I cant currently find a way to resolve this.p  pSimply put I need to autofill columns B, C, D with the formula in the cells above, if a value is in column A.p  pThis is because I am using an ever growing list of values in column A populated via the codeUNIQUEcode function from another sheet.p  pAt the moment I am manually dragging the formula down when there are more values in column A, but this is inefficient and Im sure there must be a better option.p  pIdeally due to the size of the sheet id prefer if this was completed using a formula within google sheets instead of a trigger function within google scripts, if that is the only way however that could also work.p  pThanks for any help in advancep
Negative 5608 pSo this is a robust problem. I have a function which accepts 2 args stringname, macros. Here it is so I can further explain.p  precodefunction ParseStringsstringname, macros     return mytable[stringname]      All it does it returns the stringnames value end codepre  pThe problem is that the second arg is a table, and if its a table then in the string there are going to be various parts that have the format String stuff MACROKEY more string text and the content between the  and  is the key to look up in the macro table sent with it. Now anytime a value like that appears in the string there will always be a second arg thats a table, so no problems their. I need to be able to count up the number of instances of macros in a string and then replace each macro component with its respective macros table value. So heres how the func is called in this instance...p  precodelocal mytable       mystring  My string content MACROCOMPONENT more string stuff MACROCOMPONENTSUBMACROCOMPONENTALT  local macro       MACROCOMPONENT  F,     MACROCOMPONENTSUB  Random Text,     MACROCOMPONENTALT  14598   function ParseStringsstringname, macros     return mytable[stringname]      All it does it returns the stringnames value end  ParseStringsmystring, macro codepre  pSo I am thinking string.gsubmytable[mystring]matchbsub2,mytable[mystring]matchblen  1, but this is a long and overtly complex answer AFAIK and from my tests it only does 1 replacement because the pattern is only found once and thats doesnt work well if there are multiple instances in the string. So ideasp

Negative 5608 pPlease I appreciate your help with this issue. I have a autocomplete with an abstract converter. Normally, it works well, except when I use a validator or a fvalidator. When I put the validator on the autocomplete, it goes to the generic converter, but in instead of returning the object, it always put the id value in the autocomplete input. Normally it does well this flow, by putting the object and making reference to the attribute of the class in the itemLabel. But only when I put a validator, the behavior is to put the id, making insecure the system by putting a id directly.

Negative 5608 pIve been trying to debug a chunk of code for some hours now, banging my head against the wall, and finally pinpointed my issues to a place in the code where assigning the results of a collection.findOne call to a variable is giving me different data than what I see with a console.log of the same findOne on the previous line. p  precodeprePostState  functionthisStID      console.logStudents.findOneidthisStID     var stTemp  Students.findOneidthisStID     console.logstTmp     var testsTemp  stTmp.tests codepre  pThe collection object has a tests array. In this instance, the array contains 3 objects as its elements. p  pWhile both the console.log lines return something like this  p  precode Object id eXf9dqQbaemKS24Ti, name Student,Name, group none, site SiteName, tests Array[3]   codepre  pExpanding each shows different data. The first one shows the correct tests Array[3], the second one shows tests Array[1], and the single element in that array also has data that is different from the matching element in the full array. p  pUpdatebr Doing some further testing, Ive changed the code a bit.  p  precodeprePostState  functionthisStID    console.logStudents.findidthisStID.fetch 1   var stTmp  Students.findidthisStID.fetch   console.logstTmp                                 2   console.logstTmp[0].tests.length                 3   forvar i  0 i lt stTmp[0].tests.length i       console.logstTmp[0].tests[i]                  4      codepre  p1 Returns p  precode[Object]   0 Object     id AqLHB8hT8GxzQ7zyD     group none     name Student,Name     site SiteName     tests Array[3] codepre  p2 Returnsp  precode[Object]   0 Object   id AqLHB8hT8GxzQ7zyD   group none   name Student,Name   site SiteName   tests Array[1] codepre  p3 Returnsp  precode3   codepre  pThe for loop at 4 repeats three times and prints out each of the three objects in the tests array. p  pObviously this means I can access the data I need. Instead of  p  precodevar testArray  stTmp.tests codepre  pWhich leaves me with an array with only a single element, I will just have to get the length of stTmp.tests, and then use a for loop to access each element by index and insert them into the testArray variable. p  pSo I can continue on, but I still dont understand the behavior Im seeing. Im on a bit of a timeline to keep making progress at this point, but when I have some time I may revisit this and try and replicate it in a meteorpad or other form that I can share the full code with. p

Negative 5608 pIm using bootstrap in conjunction with Shiny and R. But this doesnt really matter, because Shiny just uses a normal bootstrap installation.p  pSo my footer is coded like thisp  precode Sticky Footer  html    position relative   minheight 100   body     Margin bottom by footer height    marginbottom 40px   .footer    bottom 0   width 100    Set the fixed height of the footer here    height 40px   backgroundcolor f5f5f5   End Sticky Footer codepre  pAnd basically it works nicely. What doesnt work is the resizing I guess after all content is loaded. Since R computes a lot in the background even after the HTML code etc. is loaded, the size of the page usually gets quite bigger after loading. But then my sticky footer overlaps the content and I have been struggling with this now all day and havent found a solution yet. Any ideasp

Negative 5608 pI have created a plot with a time series on the xaxis and count values on the yaxis. I would like to know how to change the intervals on the time series xaxis so that the time interval is every 3 hours. I am not sure how to apply a simple method like atseq0,100,10 to a time series. Secondly, is it possible to use text labels for times that are not represented in your dataset i.e. the example data below are in 10minute intervals starting at 0929, but would it be possible to use time values on the xaxis that fall on the hour I am assuming that the only way to do this would be to manually list the times in a text string but wondered whether I am missing anything Any advise would be appreciated.  p  pExample datap  precodegt dputdf structurelistdatetime  structurec1396603740, 1396604340,  1396604940, 1396605540, 1396606140, 1396606740, 1396607340, 1396607940,  1396608540, 1396609140, 1396609740, 1396610340, 1396610940, 1396611540,  1396612140, 1396612740, 1396613340, 1396613940, 1396614540, 1396615140,  1396615740, 1396616340, 1396616940, 1396617540, 1396618140, 1396618740,  1396619340, 1396619940, 1396620540, 1396621140, 1396621740, 1396622340,  1396622940, 1396623540, 1396624140, 1396624740, 1396625340, 1396625940,  1396626540, 1396627140, 1396627740, 1396628340, 1396628940, 1396629540,  1396630140, 1396630740, 1396631340, 1396631940, 1396632540, 1396633140,  1396633740, 1396634340, 1396634940, 1396635540, 1396636140, 1396636740,  1396637340, 1396637940, 1396638540, 1396639140, 1396639740, 1396640340,  1396640940, 1396641540, 1396642140, 1396642740, 1396643340, 1396643940,  1396644540, 1396645140, 1396645740, 1396646340, 1396646940, 1396647540 , class  cPOSIXct, POSIXt, tzone  UTC, count  c46,  45, 47, 43, 49, 46, 46, 44, 44, 44, 45, 49, 50, 46, 45, 43, 47,  48, 48, 46, 47, 46, 46, 44, 46, 44, 45, 49, 44, 46, 44, 48, 44,  42, 44, 50, 44, 44, 48, 43, 43, 46, 44, 49, 49, 44, 42, 45, 45,  48, 46, 45, 46, 43, 40, 50, 39, 42, 48, 44, 44, 46, 43, 47, 46,  41, 43, 43, 46, 48, 45, 48, 43, 42, .Names  cdatetime,  count, row.names  cNA, 74L, class  data.frame  gtheaddf              datetime count 1 20140404 092900    46 2 20140404 093900    45 3 20140404 094900    47 4 20140404 095900    43 5 20140404 100900    49 6 20140404 101900    46 codepre  pExample code to plots all datetimesp  precodeConvert datetime character string to POSIXct format dfdatetime  as.POSIXctstrptimedfdatetime, formatdmY HMS, tzUTC  plotdfdatetime, dfcount, axesFALSE axis2,las2 axis.POSIXct1, atdfdatetime, labelsformatdfdatetime, HM datetime format can be changed as desired linesdfdatetime, dfcount, colgrey22 codepre

Negative 5608 pIve been wondering whats the best way to tackle the issue of token refresh.  Im connecting to an API which supplies me with a authtoken, if sometime time during the calls i get a INVALIDAUTH i need to reauthenticate.  So for the naive implementation i did thisp  precodeSuppressWarningsunchecked Override public ObservableltUsergt getUsers      return runCommandAndrefreshAuthIfNecessarynew RequestCommand          Override         public Observable create              return createServiceUsersApi.class.getUsers                private Observable runCommandAndrefreshAuthIfNecessaryfinal RequestCommand command      return command.create           .onErrorResumeNextnew Func1ltThrowable, Observableltgtgt          Override         public Observableltgt callThrowable throwable              return handleRefreshTokencommand                private Observableltgt handleRefreshTokenfinal RequestCommand command      return refreshToken.flatMapnew Func1ltBoolean, Observableltgtgt          Override         public Observableltgt callBoolean aBoolean              return command.create                codepre  pAs you can see im just wrapping the retrofit command, if i get an error i run refreshToken, the token refreshes and i run the retrofit command again, so finally the Observable is passed back to the subscriber. Works as expected. The thing im struggling with, is what happens i a multiple calls are made, for example, im calling getUsers and getFlags one after another. both of them get the INVALIDAUTH, currently both of the fire refreshToken, which is bad. im looking for a rxjava way to manage the calls, meaning after the first call of getUsers fires refreshToken, any call after that needs to wait for the refreshToken to end, only then fire the retrofit command.p  pAny suggestion will be appreciated.p
