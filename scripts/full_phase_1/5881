Positive 5881 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pI recently started working on a legacy product, under Linux, which incorporates a builtin TCL shell. Due to company limitations, I cant gain control to behind the scenes and all of the code I can write must be run under this TCL shell, handling the predefined clumsy TCL API of the product. p  pI found myself wondering a few times whether it will be possible to patch some Python into this setup, as some solutions seem more legitimate in Python than in TCL. By patching Python I mean either calling the Python code from the TCL code itself which can be done with emElmerem, for example, or to use Python from outside of the product to wrap the TCL API for which I found no classic solution. p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pGiven that the product already stronghasstrong an existing TCL shell emin item, most solutions I browsed through e.g. emTkinterem cant be used to run the TCL code from Python. I need to inject the code to the existing shell.p  pstrongSolutions Consideredstrongp  pAs a solution, I thought about bringing up a simple server on the TCL side which runs simple commands it receives from the Python side. I wrote a small demo and it worked. This enabled me to write a nice, class based, wrapper in Python for the clumsy TCL API, also manage a command queue, etc.p  pAnother two solutions I thought of is forking the software from Python and playing with the readwrite file descriptors or connecting through FIFO rather than a socket.p  pHowever, I wondered whether Im actually doing it right or can you suggest a better solutionp  pThanks in advance.p

Positive 5881 pI am working to update old software written to build against TclTk 8.3 so that it builds against more modern distributions. I am taking this as an opportunity to learn about C and Tcl, both of which I had never programmed in when this project began. So, Im very novice.p  pOne of the most confusing things for me in learning about the Tcl API is codeClientDatacode. Many functions in the API take it as an argument, but the C extension almost never uses it. I got the impression from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma96101481277193this answera that the global definition is rarely used    p  blockquote   pThe wholeextension ClientData is intended for extensions that want to   publish their own stub table ... that other extensions can build against.   This is a very rare thing to want to do leave at NULL if you dont   want it.p blockquote  pSo it seems that it is basically a codevoidcode parameter that you then need to type cast or handle internally. But there are some places in the code where I need to interact with ClientData e.g. for Idle Processes, as in the followingp  precodetypedef struct graph Graph  struct graph    int       num   int       hidden   int       needsRedraw ...   flag drawNowClientData data    Graph G   int g  int data   if G  lookupGraphg return TCLOK   return drawGraphG   flag drawLaterGraph G    if GgtneedsRedraw ampamp Ggthidden      GgtneedsRedraw  TRUE     TclDoWhenIdleTclIdleProc  drawNow, ClientData Ggtnum      return TCLOK  codepre  pThe cast to integer results in the following warning when I compilep  precodewarning cast from pointer to integer of different size [Wpointertointcast] codepre  pMy main confusion is codeClientData GgtnumcodeI dont understand what I am casting to, because I dont know what kind of a thing ClientData is. If I look in the Tcl sources, I do not find clarityp  precodetclCompile.h220typedef ClientData AuxDataDupProc  ClientData clientData tclInt.h2520typedef ClientData TclFSGetCwdProc2ClientData clientData tclOOInt.h73typedef ClientData TclOOPmCDCloneProcClientData clientData codepre  pA couple of final points These compiler warnings existed before I started doing any updates to the code. The program appears to work on the old systems where the original code does compile and run. So, I am not sure if this warning amounts to anything... but it spooks me, and as long as I am spending time with the code and learning about C and Tcl, I was hoping to get to the bottom of it.p  pApologies in advance if I did not provide enough relevant information. Im happy to provide more, but this my current best effort at a good question.p

Negative 5881 pI am working on a 2D scrolling game for iPhone. I have a large image background, say 4806000 pixels, of only a part is visible exactly one screens worth, 480320 pixels. What is the best way to get such a background on the screenp  pCurrently I have the background split into several textures to get around the maximum texture size limit and draw the whole background in each frame as a textured triangle strip. The scrolling is done by translating the modelview matrix. The scissor box is set to the window size, 480320 pixels. This is not meant to be fast, I just wanted a working code before I get to optimizing.p  pI thought that maybe the OpenGL implementation would be smart enough to discard the invisible portion of the background, but according to some measuring code I wrote it looks like background takes 7ms to draw on average and 84ms at maximum. This is measured in the simulator. This is about a half of the whole render loop, ie. quite slow for me. p  pDrawing the background should be as easy as copying some 480320 pixels from one part of the VRAM to another, or, in other words, blazing fast. What is the best way to get closer to such performancep

Negative 5881 pI have a project where Im collecting data in vehicles on hot swappable SATA drives in stronglow horsepower windows machinestrong.  Drives are 750G and 1 Terabyte and will likely get larger or expand to multiple 1TB drives.p  pAfter collecting the data we fedex off one drive for central collection and wish to have a backup copy remain.  Initially the thought was to put two drives in a RAID configuration and send one drive while keeping the other.p  pIve started looking at the RAID controllers and like the fact that they look like one drive to the OS and the hardware creates the copy but have tinkered enough to see that braking the two RAID 1 configured drives apart does not work.p  pSo, Im trying to learn more about some kind of mirroring of one SATA drive on another SATA drive that I could split apart and know I have a backup copy should fedex lose a drive.  The data collection PCs in vehicles are only powered up and on during the day so making a copy after data collection is not an option.  p  pThe engineer in me says Id like something like RAID lite which would do all the mirroring but then allow me to split them apart.  So far initial googling hasnt come up with anything other than software mirroring systems which we would like to avoid.p  pThis use case seems so in the vicinity of what the RAID systems are set up for that it seems there must be a solution but Ive so far been frustrated trying to ID a solution.p  pAnyone with suggestions for a hot spare RAID like mirroring functionality handled in stronghardwarestrong    I find myself thinking it is RAID .5 my made up terminology for what I want where it mirrors the data but doesnt offer to recover when one drive fails.p  pstrongUpdate 1strong I considered labeling this nonprogramming as someone else has kindly done. I didnt because strongsoftware is an optionstrong, it is just not a good one because of the volume of data and expense of writing to both drives where the RAID configuration I believe at least in theory has minimal overhead.   p  pIt seems like the more I research about RAID and about software mirroring that there must be a middle of the road option here which is hiding that Ive not found yet.p  pstrongUpdate twostrong Will try to answer some of the key questions raised by Die.p  pemDetails about failing em I was configuring arrays on one vehicles PC, copying data onto it, removing one of the arrays drives and taking it to another machine to see if I could always read the data.   More often than not, I could not read the data but I could sometimes.   I think you suggestions on making sure the system I put it into is not looking for RAID may be the key piece I was botching.  I will test this and make sure I am just taking one, actually both but one at a time, and put them in any pc which is not looking for a RAID array.p  pI have seen the warning on boot when one of the drives fails or is removed.  I dont remember for sure if the times it succeeded in allowing me to see the data if I got the warning but I will find out.p  pemWarning number 2 em I appreciate the heads up. Ive not managed to brick one yet and will be sure not to do this in the future.p  pemso that the two drives are now out of sync, dont put the second drive back inem I have done this and can confirm the little RAID controller hates me for it.  At last check with 2 750G drive it has been trying to synch them for 5 days. At last check it was at 75, weve let it run just for kicks to see if and when it ever finishes.p  pemThe above applies to RAID 1 mirroring only.em Yes definitely.  It is the config I am working with.p  pI will now retest specifically splitting the drives and then verifying they can be used individually in a completely different nonRAID configured system.  This should have been obvious to me as I know it was working sometimes and likely it depended on the config of the system I was putting a drive from a split array into.   Im expecting success and will update this to confirm before selecting this answer.  p  pstrongTestedstrong I reran several of my tests using a PC other than collection PCs which have the same RAID cards in them and confirmed that you can split these RAID1 drives as long as the system you put them into is not configured to look for a RAID drive.  This gives me two copies of the same data, one to use, and one set aside in case of problems.p

Negative 5881 pQuick question here is there any obvious benefit to use asynchronous communication with the NetworkStream class generated by TcpClient, i.e. the BeginReadBeginWrite methods rather than running a separate thread and using synchronous operations on that, i.e. ReadWrite My impression has been it could easily be quite wrong that the asynchronous operations are nonblocking and performed at OSlevel in the TCP stack perhaps, with a thread pool item for the callback. I am thinking that it surely must be different from calling ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem on the synchronous method, or it there would be rather little point in providing it. Now, Im fairly confident this is the sort of thing OSlevel calls that happens for file IO at least, but if someone could please clarify the matter regarding network TCP communication, it would be most helpful. Basically, I would like to know whether theres any specific benefit to either method besides the obvious one of being able to use the BinaryReaderStreamReader classes with the synchronous calls.p

Negative 5881 pIs it advisable to zeroin on design of a component or architecture of a software with performance in mind What I mean is, how ready should the designarchitecture be to used in a performanceintensive environmentp  pWhile designing components, should we just follow good OO principles and just ensure that the component is extendable. This way we tweak the design a bit here and a bit there as and when we run into performance issues. Although this way, we would often land up in performance issues where tweaking software a little bit might not help.p  pAlternatively, should we come up with a design, although complex, makes performance issues a cakewalk. We would still need to tweak the software, but the tweaking is often very simple as the design is performanceoriented.p  pNote In neither of the cases listed above am I trying to tune the performance of the software before running into performance issues. To rephrase the question, should the design of the software be performanceorientedp  pPlease do not answer me saying that it all depends on the environment in which a software is expected to run. The reason being that clients of any industrialgrade software just seem to want more and more and more all the time.

Negative 5881 pFirst off, Im new to MySQL Cluster. This is my pain Ive managed to setup a MySQL Cluster with two data nodes, two SQL nodes and one management server. Everything works pretty well, except the following my data nodes are spread across an intranet link which incurs latency into communications between the data nodes. Apparently, due to MySQL Clusters internal partitioning schemes, when my PHP application pulls data from the cluster via SELECT queries, parts of the data are pulled from both data nodes. This makes the page appear onscreen REALLY slowly. If I bring one data node offline, the data can only be pulled from that single remaining data node, and thus, the final result HTML output appears on the screen in a very timely fashion. So, my question is this can the data nodescluster be told to pull data from partitions stored only on a particular data node p

If I seek to that frame, and send it, the picture gets messed up because the decoder needs a IDR to decode it properly, so I resorted to finding the appropriate IDR in this case one with the time 1 and sending it as the frame with the time 4. So now the picture is decoded properly, all is well... but... If my GOV is 32, and I need to send the non IDR frame that has the index 31, and if the time span between it and the corresponding IDR is 3 seconds, I actually get 3 seconds earlier then the time I want. Now, this is not precise, because I cannot seek to the half of the GOV time span. Also, I cant set smaller GOV, so I want other ideas...p  pMy other idea was to send the last known IDR, and then send all other non IDR frames that come before the one I want, only I would set for all of them RTPTIME to be the same as the corresponding IDR. In this case the picture gets decoded perfectly, but now in the above case, 3 seconds that follow non IDR frame with the wanted time get fast paced in the decoderplayer there is no instantaneous seek...p  pAny ideas Or I can only seek to IDRs and not the frames in betweenp

Negative 5881 pHaving recently done some development for iPhone, Ive come to notice an interesting design pattern used a lot in the iPhone SDK, regarding object mutability.p  pIt seems the typical approach there is to define an immutable class codeNSFoocode, and then derive from it a mutable descendant codeNSMutableFoocode. Generally, the codeNSFoocode class defines data members, getters and readonly operations, and the derived codeNSMutableFoocode adds on setters and mutating operations.p  pBeing more familiar with C, I couldnt help but notice that this seems to be a complete opposite to what Id do when writing the same code in C. While you certainly emcouldem take that approach, it seems to me that a more concise approach is to create a single codeFoocode class, mark getters and readonly operations as codeconstcode functions, and also implement the mutable operations and setters in the same class. You would then end up with a mutable class, but the types codeFoo constcode, codeFoo constampcode etc all are effectively the immutable equivalent.p  pI guess my question is, does my take on the situation make sense I understand why ObjectiveC does things differently, but are there any advantages to the twoclass approach in C that Ive missed Or am I missing the point entirelyp  pNot an overly serious question  more for my own curiosity than anything else.p

Negative 5881 pIm performing an operation, lets call it CalculateSomeData.  CalculateSomeData operates in successive generations, numbered 1..x.  The number of generations in the entire run is fixed by the input parameters to CalculateSomeData and is known a priori.  A single generation takes anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to complete.  Some of that variability is due to the input parameters and that cannot be controlled.  However, a portion of that variability is due to things like hardware capacities, CPU load from other processes, network bandwidth load, etc.  One parameter that can be controlled pergeneration is the number of threads that CalculateSomeData uses.  Right now thats fixed and likely nonoptimal.  Id like to track the time each generation takes and then have some algorithm by which I tweak the number of threads so that each successive generation improves upon the prior generations calculation time minimizing time.  What approach should I use  How applicable are genetic algorithms  Intuition tells me that the range is going to be fairly tight  maybe 1 to 16 threads on a dual quadcore processor machine.p  pany pointers, pseudocode, etc. are much appreciated.p

Negative 5881 pI have just encountered a strange problem. I have fixed it, but I am hoping that you may be able to help me better understand what actually went wrong. Ill start with an explanation of what happened. The problem concerns a simple MVC3 RC1 app.p  pIn my apps master page there is a call to an action on a controller to render a loginformp  precodeHtml.ActionLoginForm, Account codepre  pThe action method on the AccountController class returns a PartialViewResult containing the loginform.p  precodepublic PartialViewResult LoginForm      return PartialView  codepre  pToday I made a change to this action method and attributed it with the HttpGetAttribute like sop  precode[HttpGet] public PartialViewResult LoginForm      return PartialView  codepre  pThis is what caused problems. However, the problems only existed in one particular scenario  and this is what baffles me. When empostingem a form to a controller everything would work just fine provided that the controller action then returned a emRedirectToRouteResultem. If the action just returned a emViewResultem to its default view, my Http404 error handling would kick in and loop forever.p  pI have implemented 404 error handling in a manner very similar to what is described in the third answer to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions619895howcaniproperlyhandle404sinaspnetmvcRequirements for 404a. If you dont want to read that post, in simple terms I override the HandleUnknownAction method on my base controller class, and in that method I instantiate an instance of my ErrorController class and call Execute on it, passing it an instance of RouteDatap  precodeprotected override void HandleUnknownActionstring actionName       If controller is ErrorController dont nest exceptions     if this.GetType  typeofErrorController         this.InvokeHttp404HttpContext   public ActionResult InvokeHttp404HttpContextBase httpContext      IController errorController  DependencyResolver.Current.GetServiceltErrorControllergt      var errorRoute  new RouteData     errorRoute.Values.Addcontroller, Error     errorRoute.Values.Addaction, Http404     errorRoute.Values.Addurl, httpContext.Request.Url.OriginalString     errorController.Executenew RequestContexthttpContext, errorRoute      return new EmptyResult  codepre  pAll the ErrorController does is log the error and return a view with a friendly error message. Well, thats how it emshouldem work. But in this case the error handling would enter into an infinite loop where the AccountController to which my form was posted would invoke the HandleUnknownAction over and over and over again.p  pThere was nothing in the error logs to indicate what had gone wrong I think I log just about emeverythingem  which was also strange. So I figured that if removed the HandleUnknownAction method from my controller base class maybe something else would be revealed. And it wasp  pstrong20101210 191147,956 [4] ERROR Infrastructure.Log4NetAuditor [System.Web.HttpException 0x80004005 Error executing child request for handler System.Web.Mvc.HttpHandlerUtilServerExecuteHttpHandlerAsyncWrapper.

Negative 5881 pI asked a question yesterday about namespaces that got answered, and so I tarried along. The further I get into this thing though, the more I realize, I would really like to be able to generate namespaces on the fly.  Reason being, I have a plugins directory where all the files get included.  If someone from my company is making a plugin....or a thirdparty, I dont want them to have to bother with the namespaces.  I would like to just generate the namespaces on the fly by directory structure.  You say, why not just do that  Well, I did, but I realize I still have the potential problem of classes being named the same thing and namespaces would solve this problem.  Packages would solve this problem also, but I cant find that php supports them.p  precodeplugin     tabs       tabs.php     package         tabs             tabs.php codepre  pThe idea is to be able to access the classes by tabsfunc and packagetabsfuncp  pAgain, that is not problem, except for the darn possibility of classes being named the same thing.p  pI have a workaround, but if anyone know of a workaround for dynamically creating namespaces on the fly, it would interesting to hear.p  pThe one problem I see is that PHP creates the namespace at compile time.  So using something like fsocks to pass in a namespace was a failed attempt.p

Negative 5881 pI have 3 items in play...p  p1 UIView sits at the base of the hierarchy and contains the UIScrollview. 2 UIScrollview that is presenting a lengthy user form. 3 An invisible button on the UIScrollview that Im using to provide hide the keyboard features.p  pNotice in the code below that Im registering to be notified when the keyboard is going to appear and again when its going to disappear.  These are working great.  p  pMy problem is seemingly one of layers.  See below where I insert the button into the view atIndex0.  This causes the button to be activated and stuffed behind the scrollview so that when you click on it, the scrollview grabs the touch and the button is unaware.  There is no way to reach the button and suppress the keyboard.p  pHowever, if I insert atIndex1, the button gets super imposed on top of the text entry fields and so any touch at all is acted upon by the button, which immediately suppresses the keyboard and then disappears.p  pHow do I insert the button on top of the UIScrollview but behind the UITextfields that sit therep  hr  pother logistics  I have a void hidekeyboard function that I have setup with the UIButtion as an IBAction.

Negative 5881 pIve got a server that accepts TCP connections a genserver using gentcp and for each connection it spawns a supervisor. That supervisor supervised by another, more permanent supervisor then spawns two processes a protocolspecific handler and a client context that talks to the database.p  pThe protocol handler takes TCP messages from the socket and turns them into messages for the client context. The client context takes those messages and talks to the database and returns messages that the protocol handler turns into whatever protocol its using over TCP telnet, ssh, websockets, HTTP... and sends them back to the client.p  pWhat I want to know is what OTP behaviors are appropriate for the protocol handler and client context processes. I could abuse genserver, but its 1 connection per process pair. The genfsm looks like it could work for the protocol handler, since there are a couple states it goes through, but its pretty inappropriate for the client context. I was thinking about genevent for the client context, but Ive been led to believe thats intended more for event aggregators, and this only handles events from a single source.p  pFeel free to tell me Im going about this completely the wrong way, its the first time Ive tried to make an OTP application anywhere near this complex.p

Negative 5881 pLets say I have a web site that is translated in to two languages  English and Spanish. I want to give the users a toggle switch at the top of the page that allows them to switch back and forth between the two languages. How would I do that I dont want to set up different websites. I only want one website. I just want the user to be able to click on a button or link or something and go from English to Spanish. Now as they move around the site they are viewing the entire site in Spanish. Then if they click on the button or link again they would go back to English. Is there something I have to do in the code behind to tell Sitecore to use a different languagep
Negative 5881 pIve mobile optimised my site with media queries. Everything looks how I would like it to but unnecessary images as theyre hidden with css are being downloaded, slowing page loading times.p  pThe easiest solution to this seems to be to replace as many inline images as I can with divs with background images. Then I can hide the divs with media query css for the mobile version. p  pI know there are potential downsides to this, outlined well in this post  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions492809whentouseimgvscssbackgroundimageWhen to use IMG vs. CSS backgroundimageap  pSo the company logo, pictures of staff, etc will stay as inline images. p  pAre there any issues to my approach I havnt considered Ive read a lot about mobile optimisation, particularly with media queries, and I havnt heard of anyone doing this even though it seems quite an obvious solution where images could be inline or background.p  pNote, ive done some experiments with iPhones and Android im waiting to get some Blackberrys and I know to stop background images downloading I need to set display none to the divs parent, not the div with the background image itself. p  pNote2, in an ideal world sites would probably have been built as mobile first but in this situation and often in others there is a limit to how much the original site can be modified.  p  pThanks p

Negative 5881 pI have just noticed something really odd, which I believe might be a small bug in Firefox 9.0.1. Have a look at the screenshot below. It shows Chrome 16 and Firefox 9.0.1 and how they render a fieldset with a border and a box shadow. Also, for your entertainment, a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netEC5ym relnofollowa fiddle demonstrating the issuea view in Firefox 9.0.1, obviously. As you can see, Firefox appears to apply the border and the shadow to two different shapes. Border radius is applied to both shapes separately.p  pIt didnt happen in Firefox 8, so I assume its a new bug. [EDIT OK, according to ptriek, it DOES happen in FF8.

Negative 5881 pI have a Java SOAP web service initially designed in Axis 1 which isnt meeting my performance requirements.p  pThe request Im most concerned about is one used to add lots millions of rows of data to the database. On the client side, Ill just be looping through files, pushing this data up to my web service. Each row has three elements, so the request looks something likep  precodeltSOAP EnvelopeHeaderBodygt ltAddDatagt   ltDatagt     ltFirstNamegtJohnltFirstNamegt     ltLastNamegtSmithltLastNamegt     ltAgegt42ltAgegt   ltDatagt ltAddDatagt ltSOAP EnvelopeBodygt codepre  pIm finding the following performance trendsp  ul liWhen I do one row per request, I can get around 720 rows per minute.li liWhen I encapsulate multiple rows into a single request, I can get up to 2,400 rows per minute 100 rows per request.li ul  pUnfortunately, that performance isnt going to meet our requirements, as we have hundreds millions of rows to insert at 2,500 rows per minute, it would take about 2 months to load all the data in.p  pSo Ive been looking into the application to see where our bottleneck is. Each request of 100 rows is taking about 2.5 seconds Ive tried a few different servers and get similar results. Ive found the followingp  ul liClientside overhead is negligible from monitoring the performance of my own client and using SOAP UIli liThe database activity only accounts for about 10 .2s of the total time, so Hibernate caching, etc. wont help out much.li liThe network overhead is negligible lt1ms ping time from client to server, getting 10MBs throughput with each request sending lt20KB.li ul  pSo this leaves some 2 seconds unaccounted for. The only other piece of this puzzle that I can point a finger at is the overhead of deserializing the incoming requests on the server side. I noticed that Axis 2 claims speed improvements in this area, so I ported this function over the an Axis 2 web service but didnt get the speedup I was looking for the overall time per request improved by about 10.p  pAm I underestimating the amount of time needed to deserialize 100 of the  elements described above I cant imagine that that deserialization could possibly take 2 seconds. p  pWhat can I do to optimize the performance of this web application and cut down on that 2 second overheadp  pThanks in advancep  p The next day....  The plot thickens...p  pAt the recommendation of millhouse, I investigated single row requests one a production server a bit more. I found that they could be suitably quick on good hardware. So I tried adding 1,000 rows using increments ranging from 1 1,000 separate requests to 1,000 a single request. p  ul li1 row  Request  14.5 secondsli li3req  5.8sli li5req  4.5sli li6req  4.2sli li7req  287sli li25req  83sli li100req  22.4sli li1000req  4.4sli ul  pAs you can see, the extra 2 second lag kicks in ay 7 rows per request approximately 2 extra seconds per request when compared to 6 rows per request. I can reproduce this consistently. Larger numbers of requests all had similar overhead, but that became less noticeable when inserting 1,000 rows per request. Database time grew linearly and was still fairly negligible compared to the overall request time.p  pSo Ive found that I get best performance using either 6 rows per request, or thousands of rows per request.p  pIs there any reason why 7 would have such lower performance than 6 rows per request The machine has 8 cores, and we have 10 connections in the session pool i.e. I have no idea where the threshold of 6 is coming from.p

In discussing why the code doesnt work, this difference was discussedp  precodegtgtgt c1 gtgtgt c and c  2 or True True gtgtgt c and c  2 or True False codepre  pWhat is the logic for either of c and c  2 or True vs c and c  2 or Truep  pI known that  binds stronger than or, but I dont understand what the entire construct is trying to do. It being used to enable a wildcard. As a part, I guess I need explanation on how and works on numbers I always thought about it in relation to TrueFalse conditions.p  pWhat is the point of the c and c part of either expressionp  pThanks,p  pNarniep
Negative 5881 pI have created a template proxy dll for ieframe.dll using wrappit httpwww.codeproject.comArticles16541CreateyourProxyDLLsautomatically p  pCurrently, I am trying to hook it to test if it works before modifying any function, however, when I tried it, Windows starts throwing out DEP errors and explorer.exe keeps crashing, as such, I tried disabling DEP for Windows Explorer, but explorer still keep crashing. Restarting the machine doesnt work either.p  pI am wondering if there is ieframe.dll is anything different about ieframe.dll in particular as compared to other dlls.

Negative 5881 pIt is common that gameclients establish a p2p connection to reduce the latency and the load on the server.p  pstrongBut how do they do thatstrongp  pHere an example I open my League of Legends client. Press on Play. Then my client sends the request to the server to find a game. Then the server responds with a list of players ip addresses. My client now connects to each player to reduce the ping.p  pAnd this is what confuses me. I and many other players are sitting behind a NAT. So maschines from the internet can only send data to my computer if i forward a port on my router or when i send data to a accessible server open a website, send a request to the game server.p  pstrongMe and my opponent have the ip address of each other but we cant connect to each other because our routers are blocking the connection.strong p
Negative 5881 pIm using the jQuery a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdemosautocompletecombobox relnofollowAutocompletea but I need it to be editable.

Negative 5881 pI am interested in solving the TSP for small grid graphs. Any sort of library will do for me, but this seems to be harder than expected. I tried a couple of solvers I found out there including concorde, but they all seem to have problems when the triangle inequality does not hold.p  pFor instance, I would like the solver to output the tour 0, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3 for the graph with unit edge weights belowp  precode012   34 codepre  pIn this particular case, I told concorde that the edge 2, 4 had weight 1000 and concorde promptly produced the tour 0, 1, 2, 4, 3 of cost 1004. This is clearly not what I am looking for.p  pIdeally, there would be some simple possibly brute force implementation in Java, but anything which works will actually do. Can anyone point me to some code or do I really have to go an implement this myselfp  pEdit also, it is important that I get an exact solution, not some approximation.p  pEdit2 indeed, this does not seem to be TSP. What I am trying to find is a shortest closed walk which visits all vertices.p

Negative 5881 pEDIT Recent happenings of me compiling a program I know could not compile lead me to believe I am simultaneously having an issue with my compiler. No doubt due to my running it in WINE on mac as opposed to a native application. Thank you for your responses. I will properly test out all responses and make all changes when I have fixed said error with compiler or I have moved computers to one with a working one.p  pI am relatively new to programming and also this website so please bear with me. I am getting an error with my two of my If statements and one dowhile that I am unable to resolve. p  pThe entire program works as intended but two blocks which are below. The problem is that when I enter the character y, everything works as intended and the Results   Arrays.toStringrow prints as I expected it to. It also proceeds to continue through the original For loop and start the program again. p  pHowever, when I enter any other character, i.e not y or n the code does not print Input must be either y or n and just waits for another input. Even when n is entered, it does not follow out of the  the loop as I wanted, it just continues to loop and not proceed to the else if I had thought it would. It does this indefinitely, not accepting any other input than y to continue passed the loop so I can never receive the print negative. p  pDoes anyone have any thoughts as to why this is happening While not technically homework, I tagged it as such as I want to know, if possible, what is happening as opposed to just how to fix it.p  precode        do              ans  input.next.charAt0                 if ans.equalsy    ans.equalsn                      System.out.println Input must be either y or n                           while ans.equalsy    ans.equalsn codepre  pandp  precodeif ans.equalsy              for Object[] row  prevResults                      System.out.printlnResults    Arrays.toStringrow                                else if ans.equalsn              System.out.printlnNegative             System.exit0           codepre  pFull code is as below p  precodeimport java.util.  public class Averages      public static void main String [] args           declare variables         int course, exam, average  0         char ans         String pass          creating objects         Scanner input   new ScannerSystem.in         ListltObject[]gt prevResults  new ArrayListltObject[]gt          full loop         for int i  0 i lt 5 i                System.out.println Loop   i   out of 5              Course loop             do              System.out.println Please enter a course mark out of 100             course  input.nextInt                 if course gt 100                      System.out.println Number entered is over 100                               while course gt 100              Exam loop             do              System.out.println Please enter an exam mark out of 100             exam  input.nextInt                 if exam gt 100                      System.out.println Number entered is over 100                               while exam gt 100               average  course  exam2               Final Grade             System.out.println The average mark is   average              if  average gt 50 ampamp course gt 40 ampamp exam gt 40                   System.out.println The final grade is pass                 pass  Pass                          else                  System.out.println The final grade is fail                 pass  Fail                           add to array             prevResults.addnew Object[]  Course mark   course, Exam mark   exam,Average   average, Grade   pass               System.out.println Would you like to see previous results yn               Previous results question loop             do                  ans  input.next.charAt0                     if ans.equalsy    ans.equalsn                          System.out.println Input must be either y or n                                   while ans.equalsy    ans.equalsn                Close or Array if statement             if ans.equalsy                  for Object[] row  prevResults                          System.out.printlnResults    Arrays.toStringrow                                            else if ans.equalsn                  System.out.printlnNegative                 System.exit0                        end for      end main end class codepre  pstrongEDIT 2strong I have switch computers and all the suggested answers to indeed work.

Negative 5881 pIm using CakePHP on my project and storing PHP sessions on memcached. CakePHP uses PHP to handle sessions and PHP use memcached. On every user log in I store the users IP and sessionid on the database. When I was using cake to handle sessions, when a user was trying to logging in I could get its IP and go to the DB to get the last session from this IP address. Having the sessionid from the last log in I could check if the session file still present on sessions dir and decide if the user can log in or not.brp  pstrong[OBS I know that users can set proxy and bypass this info, but generally users wont know it because of the profile of people who uses the application. As the application is a kind of a game, users cant share information. At least I should avoid it.]strongbrp  pBy handling log ins this way I had a problem because many times CakePHP logged out the users but the session file stills there. [Maybe it is a configuration problem with session time out  garbage collector to delete the files.] I gave up solving this because I was forced to have many servers for the application, so I had to move sessions to MySQL or memcached. As part of the application is used in pure PHP without CakePHP, Ive opted to used memcached as Im able to use PHP session functions. If I opted for MySQL I would have to pass session id on requests, and, for security reasons, I dont think it is a good idea.brp  pSo, my question is, now that the sessions are on memcache, how, on a user log in attempt, can I check if theres another user logged on the same network It should be solved if I could check if the memcache key exists.

Negative 5881 pWere currently using the Microsoft Sync Framework 2.1 to sync data between a cloud solution and thick clients. Syncing is initiated by the clients and is download only. Both ends are using SQL Server and Im using the SqlSyncScopeProvisioning class to provision scopes. We cannot guarantee that the clients will be running the latest version of our software, but we have full control of the cloud part and this will always be up to date.p  pWere considering supporting versioning of scopes so that if, for example, I modify a table to have a new column then I can keep any original scope e.g. ScopeAV1, whilst adding another scope that covers all the same data as the first scope but also with the new column e.g. ScopeAV2. This would allow older versions of the client to continue syncing until they had been upgraded. p  pIn order to achieve this Im designing data model changes in a specific way so that I can only add columns and tables, never remove, and all new columns must be nullable. In theory I think this should allow older versions of my scopes to carry on functioning even if they arent syncing the new data.p  pI think Im almost there but Ive hit a stumbling block. When I provision the new versions of existing scopes Im getting the correctly versioned copies of my SelectChanges stored procedure, but all the table specific stored procedures not specific to scopes  i.e. tableAupdate, tableAdelete, etc are not being updated as I think the provisioner sees them as existing and doesnt think they need updated.p  pIs there a way I can get the provisioner to update the relevant stored procedures update, insert, etc so that it adds in the new parameters for the new columns with default values null, allowing both the new and old versions of the scopes to use them p  pAlso if I do this then when the client is upgraded to the newer version, will it resync the new columns even though the rows have already been synced albeit with nulls in the new columnsp  pOr am I going about this the completely wrong way Is there another way to make scopes backwards compatible with older versionsp

Negative 5881 pIve renamed a branch in the repo and carelessly kept working with the same working copy that was checked out from that branch before the rename. When I later tried to commit, Ive noticed the working copy is still targeting the old path. I want to commit the changes to the new path in the repo, while of course keeping history etc...p  pDo SVN has an elegant way around thisp  pI read about commands Switch and Relocate but Im not sure any of them completely suits my problem the scenarios described are different, and Ive always been a bit frightened about trying out commands in the SVN... Does anyone has experience with these commandsp  pI guess I can go around the problem by, for example, checkout the renamed project to another working copy and then overwrite it with the changes all besides the SVN metadata. I can also write some script that finds all occurrences of the old path and brutally change them to the new paths but I figured there must be some kind of SVN command for this.p  pThanksp

Negative 5881 pOkay, you may call me a noob but Im realling confused.p  pMy ex classmate paid me to write a program in C. She gave me the task and it said something like blah blah blah make at least TWO CLASSES, write at least ONE CONSTRUCTOR and rewrite at least ONE METHOD it says that word by word.p  pAnd then I told her this is C not C she said but were learning Cp  pI ignored it and wrote the program in c and sent to her as I thought she didnt know what she was talking about. She said it doesnt work on code blocks, and wtf is cout ltlt and then she sent me a chunk of code that they write and instead of cout and cin there was printf and scanf. It had to be C. So, I rewrote the program with printf and scanf and she still says codeblocks throw errors I still left classes as task demanded.p  pstrongDoes C have classes Or is there a misunderstanding or somethingstrongp

Negative 5881 pThis is more of a personal preference question than a rightwrong question...p  pI have an about us page that is filled with schema.org microdata.  We have nameaddressphoneetc... on our front page, as well.p  pIs there any point including that microdata on the front page  It seems like it would be better for search engines to only have 1 page to point to.  At the same time, though, it seems like 1 page should be the front page.p

Negative 5881 pFirst, a brief description of the library that brought this upp  pI have a library that listens continuously on a provided serial port, reading in blocks of bytes and passing them along to be processed in some meaningful way details arent important to the question.  To make the library a bit more reusable, processing these bytes was abstracted out to an interface FrameProcessor.  A few default implementations exist in the library itself to handle processing thats always going to occur regardless of the application using it.  However, theres support for adding in custom processors to do things the application specifically cares about.p  pAside from the bytes being passed to these processors, theres a data object ReceiverData that contains information that most but not guaranteed to be all of the processors might find interesting.  Its maintained entirely by the library itself i.e. it isnt the responsibility of the application to setupmaintain any instances of ReceiverData.  They shouldnt have to care how the data is made available, just that it is available.p  pRight now, ReceiverData is being passed as a parameter to each processorp  precodepublic interface FrameProcessor       public boolean processbyte[] frame, ReceiverData receiverData  codepre  pHowever, I really dont like this approach, as its requiring data to be passed to something that might not necessarily care about it.  Also, for the processors that do care about ReceiverData, theyve got to pass the object reference around in whatever other method calls they make provided those method calls need to access that data.p  pIve considered changing the FrameProcessor to an abstract class and then defining a setter for a protected ReceiverData member.  But that seems kind of gross as well  having to iterate over the list of all FrameProcessors and setting the ReceiverData instance.p  pIve also thought about some kind of static threaded context objectnecessarily threaded since the library supports listening on multiple ports at once.  Essentially, youd have something like the followingp  precodepublic class ThreadedContext       private static MapltLong, ReceiverDatagt receiverData      static          receiverData  new HashMapltLong, ReceiverDatagt           public static ReceiverData get          return receiverData.getThread.currentThread.getId           public static void putReceiverData data          receiverData.putThread.currentThread.getId, data       codepre  pThat way, when each thread in the library started, it could just add a reference to its ReceiverData to ThreadedContext, which would then be available as needed to the processors without needing to pass it around.p  pThis is certainly a pedantic question, as Ive already got a solution that works fine.  It just bothered me.  Thoughts  Better approachesp

Negative 5881 pGiven items on a webpage that get changed by AJAX calls over time, how can a userscript get notified about those changes, whenever they occurp  pImagine the Facebook newsfeed.

Negative 5881 pSo, Im writing an application, that takes an image, and immediately sends it to a remote computer, using sockets.p  precodeOutputStream mStream  mStream  mySocket.getOutputStream   filling headerbmbytes mStream.writeheader mStream.writeBitmapBytes  mStream.flush not working  try       wait2000  catch InterruptedException e    mStream.close codepre  pThe write functions work perfectly, until the last few kilobytes. A random amount of data is not sent about 295 kb of 300 kb is good. As I read its because it blocks until it buffers all the data, but it doesnt seem to care whether data is actually sent, so mStream.close is called too soon. If I uncomment the wait section, it works perfectly, but I might need to call more than one time per second, and its still unreliabledepending on the connection, so i need an other way to call close properly. Flush doesnt seem to do anything. Am I using it wrong Any ideas appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 5881 pIve recently been trying to learn myself to use QT and as part of an exercise Ive set up some simple stuff for managing a deck of cards adding and removing cards by dragging and dropping and other simple stuff like that. However as you might imagine, its not going as smoothly as Id have hoped it would. To implement this logic Ive used 3 classes, Card, Node and Pile which all have their own headers with prototypes on what you can do with them.p  pThe issue here is that when I try to compile them the compiler starts complaining about duplicate symbols in the object file concerning the functions of different classes. If I comment one away with   the problem only moves one function down the line and the only things the compiler doesnt complain about are the destructors. Heres what it says more specifically whenever I try to compilep  precodeduplicate symbol NodeNodeCard in Node.o and Node.o codepre  pThis is what the .hpp header looks likep  precodeifndef NODEHPP define NODEHPP include Card.hpp class Node       Node next       Card c public       Node         NodeCard newCard       Node       Node getNext       void appendNodeCard newCard       void printCard        void setNextNode nextNode       Card getCard Returns card in node with removal       Card peekCard Returns card in node without removal   endif NODEHPP codepre  p...and this is what the actual .cppfile looks likep  precodeinclude Node.hpp include Card.hpp  include ltstring.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  NodeNodeCard newCard     c  newCard     next  NULL   NodeNode     freec     delete this   Node NodegetNext     return next   void NodeappendNodeCard newCard     ifnext  NULL         next  new NodenewCard          else         Node NodePointer  next         whileNodePointergtgetNext  NULL             NodePointer  NodePointergtgetNext                  NodePointergtnext  new NodenewCard        void NodeprintCard     cgtprintCard   void NodesetNextNode nextNode     next  nextNode   Card NodegetCard     return c     c  NULL   Card NodepeekCard     return c  codepre  pSo Im essentially now out of ideas about what could be wrong as Ive tried everything I could think of and in my opinion, the code should be ok as no matter how hard I try to look, I cant see anything wrong with it. So as Google searches and searches at a bunch of other sites didnt turn out anything, Im now turning to stackoverflow as you code wizards with plenty more experience should have a better eye for spotting out what I atleast think are newbie mistakes.p

Negative 5881 pI am getting information from a database that I have no control over. The value of state is a user entered and properly cleaned value, but may be the written out state name or the two letter postal abbreviation. I can easily build an associative array of states and abbreviations.

So, if you enter CA it sees it is a valid two letter strongkeystrong and returns it. If it sees XY is NOT a valid strongkeystrong then it retuns a default OTHER key ZZ, but if the user entered input is New York it will see it is a valid strongvaluestrong and return the associated key, NYp

Negative 5881 pI know how to create a JAR file with the source code with maven, and also create an executable JAR.

Negative 5881 pWhat is difference between Atomicity and consistency  it looks to me as both are saying same thing in different word.p  pAtomicityp  pAll tasks of a transaction are performed or none of them are. There are no partial transactions. For example, if a transaction starts updating 100 rows, but the system fails after 20 updates, then the database rolls back the changes to these 20 rows.p  pConsistencyp  pThe transaction takes the database from one consistent state to another consistent state. For example, in a banking transaction that debits a savings account and credits a checking account, a failure must not cause the database to credit only one account, which would lead to inconsistent data.p

Negative 5881 pI have an application that starts four threads to listen on incoming packets. Every thread opens a socket on a different port. Normally packets are received only on one port at the time, but in some cases messages can be received on two ports for some seconds. Every of these threads processes the messages and updates a bunch of listeners all of them are doing some Swing painting stuff. As the messages are sent with a frequency of 10 Hz and the painting actions on the Swing components take some time, my first approach was to process only one messages out of 20 2 seconds time to finish the paint on the components. Works well...p  pBut when receiving two messages at the time, I need to tell my application just to process one of them the one received only for short time. In summary 10 messages are received on the 2nd port, also with a frequency of 10 Hz. Means, using the first approach sometimes I miss all 10 of them, because only one out of 20 is processed.p  pWhenever a messages on the 2nd port is received I want my application to process that one, doesnt matter what is received on the 1st port or if something is painted at that time.p  pThe following code shows the implementation of my threads, four of these are started at the same time depending on the ports given through the constructor.p  precodeprivate class IncomingRunner implements Runnable       private int listenPort     private DatagramSocket localSocket     private DatagramPacket packet     private int counter  0      public IncomingRunnerint port          this.listenPort  port           Override     public void run          try              localSocket  new DatagramSocketlistenPort              byte[] buffer  new byte[1024]             packet  new DatagramPacketbuffer, buffer.length              whileisRunning                 recvIncomingMsg           catch SocketException e              e.printStackTrace                    private void recvIncomingMsg          try              localSocket.receivepacket             port  localSocket.getLocalPort              ReceivedMsg eventMsg              ifport  Config.PORT1                  eventMsg  new ReceivedMsgConfig.PORT1, Config.SOMETHING1                 System.out.printlnHexWriter.getHexpacket.getData              else if port  Config.PORT2                  eventMsg  new ReceivedMsgConfig.PORT2, Config.SOMETHING2                 System.out.printlnHexWriter.getHexpacket.getData              else if port  Config.PORT3                  eventMsg  new ReceivedMsgConfig.PORT3, Config.SOMETHING3                 System.out.printlnHexWriter.getHexpacket.getData              else                  eventMsg  new ReceivedMsgConfig.PORT4, Config.SOMETHING4                 System.out.printlnHexWriter.getHexpacket.getData                           counter              ifcounter20  0                  forward2PacketPaneleventMsg                 counter  0                        catch IOException e              e.printStackTrace                    private void forward2PacketPanelfinal ReceivedMsg t          forfinal IPacketListener c  listeners              ifc instanceof IPacketListener                  new Threadnew Runnable                      Override                     public void run                          IPacketListenerc.updatet                                      .start                             codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong The reason why I am starting new Threads to update the listeners is, because all of them should update the GUI at the same time. Every codeupdatedcode calls a codepaintComponentcode method on a different codeJPanelcode. So all of them should run together.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong I cannot use the first approach as this causes messages loss of maybe important messages received on 2nd port. What I need is, when a normal Msg is received just process it and do the painting, doesnt matter how many new normal messages on 1st port come in. But even if only one Msg on 2nd port is received, the application needs to process that one, regardless what is going on in the normal receiver thread.p  pI guess I am facing two problems herep  ol lipI need to make each thread waiting until the painting is finished, as that is UDP I can process a normal packet, and forget about all following normal packets, during the painting actions. When done, process the next normal packet.pli lipIf a packet on 2nd port is received, break all normal packet processing actions and do the things needed to process the special packet.pli ol  pProblem 1 is solved using a BitSet in the MainIncomingClass. Every Listener uses some kind of callback function to indicate that its done with painting and sets a specific Bit in the BitSet. If not all are true, I do not process any new Packet, just let them go.p

Negative 5881 pOK Im new to responsive design and so bear with me whilst I try to explain this. So it seems that the way responsive design works is that different css media queries are triggered based on the users window width. If thats the case then dont the new iphones and tablets mess this up because of the devices high pixels per inch density compared to desktops 72ppi So the web pages that were once designed for say mobiles at 320px are not triggered by say the iphone5 because of the higher ppi 336 at 640x1136 and instead say trigger the web page intended for tablets when this isnt ideal  p  pI aprechiate you guys helping me clear things upp

Negative 5881 pIm using Phing as my build tool for a website im developing. I have a server running on localhost to test things on my own system, and i have a test environment on the server its eventually going to run on. Deploying to that test environment is currently done by tarring all the built files, uploading the tar to the server and extracting it there. p  pHowever, since im also using quite a bit of images, this takes pretty damn long 10 seconds for local deploy vs 4 minutes for a remote deploy. Is there any way to either compare files in 2 directories and only tar the ones that are newer in one dir so i can keep a shadow copy of the build dir to compare file dates or another best practicep  pSomething else ive been thinking about trying is uploading the site using git.

Negative 5881 pI have created a SQL Server 2008 Agent job that runs against all databases on the server. I am using the undocumented MS procedure, codespMSforEachDBcode. I am specifying only certain databases to be processed and when these databases are found, if codeERRORNUMBER  208code, I want a table to be created and processing to continue to the next database. I also want to omit the system databases so the tabel doesnt get created in a system database.

Also, when I run it, I get a table created in the master database, which I do not want to do. What I am trying to do with the code I created is 1. select all the databases on the SQL server with name like xyz  2. if table SESSIONS exists, then delete all records older than 5 minutes 3. if table SESSIONS doesnt exist, then create it and continue processing      this is where I get the code208 error  invalid object because this table does not existcode When the job sees there is no Sessions table, the job stops and no other databases are processed. I need all the named databases in 1 to be processed. If the SESSIONS table is not present, I get a 208 error that says Invalid object name master.SchemaName.sessions. If I set the focus to the database without the sessions table, my code runs and the tables is created but I still get an error 208  Invalid object name master.SchemaName.sessions. No other error are displayed.p  pIf someone could look at my code to see where my problem is, that would be great.p  pI have verified that I am getting the 208 error by using the Try Catch below.

Negative 5881 pCurrently, Im developing a socket.iobased chat that runs off an strongHTTPSstrong Node.js server. Ive successfully finished the correct steps for creating a selfsigned certificate to run the server on. I want to implement a login system thats CPU and RAM efficient and preferably doesnt use any extra Node.js modules.p  pCurrently, this is how I have my user database set upp  ol liOn server startup, the server reads and stringifys a JSON file that contains the user data and load the array into the memory. A sample of the database looks like socode[userusername, passpassword, id23a45b]codeli liWhen login.html is sent an HTTP POST request from a login form, the server preforms this FOR loop, where codepostdatacode is the HTTP POST and codeuserdatacode is the user database prefor var i  0 i lt userdata.length i              if postdata.user  userdata[i].user                  if userdata[i].pass  postdata.pass                      res.writeHeadSetCookiechatuser  userdata[i].user, SetCookiechatid  userdata[i].id                                       preli liWhen the user wants to send a message via socket.io, theyd send the message along with their username and ID. Another FOR loop would search the user database and crosscheck the ID and username to make sure they match. This would happen emevery timeem a message was sent.li ol  pDoes the following system sound efficient and secure What things can I improve and change My concern is that keeping an ementireem user database in the memory would be too much for a simple server, and that the CPU could be doing more useful things then checking a database every time a message is sent.p

Negative 5881 pIm having doubts on how to proceed regarding the class structure of my gamesimulation framework. Please note that I am doing this mostly for my own enjoyment, I know there are lots of good solutions already out there p  pThe structure of the framework has, among other things, codeScenecodes that contain codeActorcodes. Both codeScenecodes and codeActorcodes can behave in many different ways WRT some aspects of how stuff works internally. I have implemented such behaviours using multiple inheritance, like sop  precodeclass ActorBase  public Object  ...   class Actor  virtual public ActorBase  ...  class CollisionBehavior  virtual public ActorBase  ...   class BoundingBoxCollisionBehavior  public CollisionBehavior  ...  class MyActor  public Actor, public BoundingBoxCollisionBehavior  ...  codepre  pThis way, using virtual inheritance, I can separate the implementation of what the actor is from the implementation of what the actor does or how it does it. Both the codeActorcode and code...Behaviorcode classes need access to the common base class codeActorBasecode for their implementation, but things are neatly compartmentalised and I can easily change the behaviour of an object by simply replacing the codeBehaviorcode class it inherits from.p  pThis has its limitation though since each behaviour follows its own internal rules, and an object can inherit from a single codeBehaviorcode or else hell breaks loose because of ambiguous function calls etc, I can never have two actors with different behaviours interact with each other. Also, since Im integrating the V8 Javascript Engine into the framework, Id have to create wrapped child classes for each possible combination of codeActorcode or codeScenecode and their possible behaviours, and instancing these object in a mixed fashion from JS would result in a crash because, again, two object that behave differently cannot interact with each other at least not for everything.p  pAn alternative solution I thought would be to abandon this multiple inheritance structure in favour of something like this each object that requires codeBehaviorcodes has many arrays, one for each codeBehaviorcode group like collision behavior, movement behavior, etc, with a code...Behaviorcode object for each possible behavior. I can give an object a default behavior and, if its ever needed an interaction occurs with an object with a different default behavior, I can add such behavior to one or both objects so that they can interact with each other  there would need to be some sort of conversion policy, but thats not an issue. This would mean having a circular reference the object instance references the behavior instance and the behavior instance references the object its contained in for the behavior to be able to access the base properties it needs to do its own thing. The codeBehaviorcode subclasses would also need to be codefriendcodes with the codeActorcode class, to access protected andor private members. Im dont really like this road that much, and I think there might be a more elegant way to solve this problem, I just havent thought of one yet.p  pThoughts  p  pBonus Question should I spell Behavior or BehavioUr Not a native speakerp  pEDIT Solved the bonus question  depends or where you feel you are when on the Internet p  pEDIT 2 Changed from codeBehaviorcode to codeCollisionBehaviorcode for clarity see answer belowp

Negative 5881 pIm building an app that allows the user to insert products and information about those products. all information on one products is inserted in different textfields in a custom codeTableViewCellcode.

Negative 5881 pI pasted the code below. That is commented enough.  Clear about wait. When comes here it jumps to another block. That part i am oaky.  My doubt is Why we are using notify and notifyAll. If you remove these two from below code, it works fine.p  precodeclass Reader extends Thread     Calculator c     here we didnt write noarg constructor.  Note this.      one  arg constructor.     public ReaderCalculator calc         c  calc          public void run         synchronizedc          2. Acquiring the object lock and executes this code of block.             try                 System.out.printlnWaiting for calculation...                 c.wait                  3.  Release the object lock and moves to the second synchronize block below                  6. Later the object get the lock here and moves on.             catchInterruptedException e                          System.out.printlnTotal is c.total                   public static void mainString[] args         Instantiating new with noarg.  One more doubt,  How this work without noarg constructor above.  Please explain.         Calculator calculator  new Calculator         Instantiating new with onearg         new Readercalculator.start         new Readercalculator.start         new Readercalculator.start          1. Once you start here it will goto first synchronized code block above         calculator.start        class Calculator extends Thread     int total      public void run         synchronizedthis          4. This block acquires that object lock and executes the code block below.              forint i0ilt100i                 total i                           5.  As per documentation,  If we give notify it will release the object lock to only one thread object of its choice.                  If we use notifyAll it will release the object lock to all the three thread object.             notify              My doubt here is without using the notify or notifyAll it is working fine.              As per docs if we use notify only one object should get the lock.  That is also not working here.                codepre

Negative 5881 pIm trying to write a search function that can use logical operator to filter results.

Negative 5881 pHave had 1.9.3p194 RubyInstaller with Ruby on Rails and all kinds of Gems installed on my WinXP. Now I want to update the whole setup.p  pUpdating RoR to 4.0.0 and gems was easy codegem update railscode, codegem update systemcode, codegem updatecode.p  pBut how do I do that with Ruby Is there an easy way to update the installationp  pIf not, and I have to install the fresh package, then how do I do it with little hasslep  pI have downloaded the fresh 2.0 RubyInstaller. I have read that I shouldnt install this new Ruby version in the same directory as my old Ruby version codecprogramsRubycode thats why I chose a codecprogramsRuby200code directory. During the installation I clicked on every additional setting, including the include new directory in the PATH variable type of choice. But now when I type coderuby vcode I still get 1.9.3p194 and the new directory is absent from PATH I havent rebooted, so maybe this has something to do with it.p  pSo how should I really install the new version Should I simply change the old PATH to the new one Or should I instead only add the new one without removing the old path so there will be some kind of advantage of having both 1.9.3 and 2.0 Or should I simply delete both installations and install 2.0 from the startp  pHow do I easily transfer the gems or the list of them, so the codegem updatecode could handle the installationupdating from my old installation to the new onep  pI am using JetBrains RubyMine 5.4 editor, and would like to know if I need to do something there as well for both the new and the existing projects.p

Negative 5881 pI am attempting to complete an exercise in a C book Sams Teach Yourself C in 21 Days, chapter 18, exercise 7.p  pMy challenge is that I am unable to understand why the value of a type double variable array pointed to by a void pointer changes unexpectedly, but the values of other data types I point show as expected.  p  pIn the code below, I call a function that returns a void pointer to an array of any data type.

In the example above, the section commences with codelth2gtlth2gtcode with an entry for the file inclusive of the file extension. I want to write a python script which will basically allow me to list a number of file extensions ie .log, .txt etc. and Id then like to edit the HTML page and only include those entries that contain those file extensions and if this isnt the case, remove the table entry and all the associated data for that table entry. So in the code above, the whole of this data would be stripped out from the HTML if I were to solely look for files with .xls and .jpg for example.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 5881 pI encountered this problem while posting this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20694323slickwriteasimpletablecreationfunctionSlick Write a Simple Table Creation Functionap  pI am very new to Slick and concurrency, knowing only the basics. I worked with JDBC before, but in there you have to manually open a session and then close it. Nothing goes beyond that, and there is very little automation at least I didnt have to make automated process.p  pHowever, I get confused with Slick session.

This   simplifies the session handling by attaching a session to the current   thread so you do not have to pass it around on your own or at least   assign it to an implicit variable.p blockquote  pWell, I researched a bit online, and some people suggest not to use threadLocalSession and only use implicit session. Some suggest using threadLocalSession.p  pOne reason to support implicit session is that makes sure at compile time that you have a session.

Negative 5881 pI have a triangle polygon on a MKMapView that I would like to redraw very quickly or to anchor in a specific position on the phone.p  pThis polygon will always point to the top of the phone but the map itself will spin to supplied headings. Currently the only way I have come up with is to remove the overlay and then readd it. The problem with this is that it is strongverystrong choppy.p  pThe next idea I had was to just add a triangle image over the map and resize the map as needed this triangle image be an accurate visualization of what the polygon would be when added as a map overlay.

Negative 5881 pOk, so i have a multimodule web project Spring, Hibernate and all that consisting out of a WAR and 3 JARs. 2 of those JARs are optional extensions of the core WAR and JAR. The extentions are used by maven profiles which add them as dependencies or not. This all works fine.p  pHowever while installing the project on a Tomcat server i noticed i couldent edit the property files of the extension modules since they are packaged in a JAR file.

Negative 5881 pIm building an activerecord to model a conversation tree, using an array column type to represent the materialized path of the records place in that tree, using postgres 9.1, rails 4.0, and the pg gem.p  pWhat I really want to do is access currvalconversationsidseq when I create a new conversation object, so that I can pass in [grandparentid, parentid ... currentid] as the array to the object initializer. That way I can specify that this column is not null as a database constraint, and in the event of a parentless conversation, have it still default to [currentid].p  pThe problem I have is getting access to the models id value before I save it the first time. I could always relax the not null constraint and add an aftercreate hook, but that feels kludgy. Im hopeful that theres a way I can grab the value thats getting pushed into id inside the initializer, before the first save to the database.p  pEDIT to clarify for the bounty In an ideal world, there would be a special token I could pass in to the objects create method Conversation.createreplychain [lastval], where the  gem took that to mean lastval in the generated SQL.p

Negative 5881 pI have a page, including WebView. I had codeandroidconfigChanges...orientationscreenSizecode in manifest and in worked perfectly well I scroll view to a particular text, and when screen orientation changes, the WebView is positioned to the same text on the top this is not same as preserving ScrollY,  because of changed width.p  pNow I changed the design and have different layouts for horizontal and vertical orientation. I prefer to remove orientationscreenSize for the activity to allow reconstructing the page when orientation changes. Everything works fine, but I need to restore the text offset manually.p  pThe closest I could find is  codegetOffsetForPositiongetScrollX, getScrollYcode for saving offset and  codebringPointIntoViewoffsetcode  for restoring offset, however these function are not backwardcompatible getOffsetForPosition wants API 3, while bringPointIntoView requires API 14 . In addition they apply to TextView and may be inaccurate with WebView because of HTML tags.p  pTried codeWebView.saveStatecode and codeWebView.restoreStatecode called after the page has been loaded. Doesnt seem to work for me.p  pYes, I can get calculate scroll position using Paint and FontMetrics, but this is a dirty trick. Ideally, I prefer to get all parameters from the system and keep the code as much backward compatible as possible.p

Negative 5881 pIve been banging my head for a few days over this problem so I figured Id look for some help here.p  pstrongBACKGROUNDstrongbr  Weve built a form where users can, amongst other things, upload files.  We have implemented desktop drag and drop for HTML5 users.  Were also using uploadify for traditional upload.  The ONLY reason were using uploadify is to allow users of older browsers to multiselect files.  If it wasnt for the multiselect feature in older browsers, we would not be using any library for uploading and just use the new multiple attribute of the file input.p  pstrongPROBLEMstrongbr  I consider uploadify and desktop drag amp drop 2 methods for basically doing the same thing which is allowing the user to give you an array files which they wish to upload.  Once this is done, I think both methods should call the same function, passing in the array of files intended for upload.  However, it seems that the file collection from uploadify is anatomically different than the file collection from drag and drop e.originalEvent.dataTransfer.files.p  pSo at this point, it looks like I have 2 options 1  Find a way to manually add the files collected from desktop drag and drop to the uploadify que and then call the upload method.p  p2  Find a way to collect the selected queued files from uploadify and pass them to a separate ajax method the same on the drag and drop files are passed to.  I almost got this working but, as I mentioned, the file objects are different.p  pHas anyone had to deal with this before  Are there more elegant solutions that Im missing here  Any help would be appreciated.  I can add code samples if anyone needs it.p

Negative 5881 pWas working on this script when I came across a weird anomaly. When I go to print extract after declaring it, it prints correctly the followingp  precodeMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSDTA TIIIIIIIIIIIIITIIIVVIIIIIIIIIIIITTT codepre  pNow the weird part, when I then try to print or return extract or column inside of the while loop, it comes up empty, thus rendering the rest of the script useless. Ive never come across this before up until now, havent been able to find any documentation or people with similar problems as mine. Below is the code, I marked with lt where the problems are and are not, to see if anyone can have any idea what is going on Thank you kindly. p  pP.S.

While this works, the minute I change start to another number that is not 0 say 200, the code brings up errors. Probably has something to do with the number of column elements does not match the lines. Will keep updated. p

Negative 5881 pIm having trouble making this predicate work.

Negative 5881 pIm wondering if Im not overcomplicating this. First off, the reason I want my own swipe is to get both the start and end touches of the swipe, and the ability to create a compound gesture multiple swipes would be recognized as a single gesture  example glyphlike pattern recognition.p  pAnyways, Im tracking metrics during touchesMoved but I do not have a good way to make sure that the users touch is on a line or even if the velocity is valid. Im finding that the touchesMoved callback provides touch samples that deviate a fair bit touchesMoved samples have included deviation of more than 50. My thoughts for doing this in touchesMoved is two fold. One, to ensure that the swipe is straight, and two, to cancel the gesture if necessary.p  pHeres my touchesMovedp  precode voidtouchesMovedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      [super touchesMovedtouches withEventevent]      UITouch currentTouch  UITouch [touches anyObject]     CGPoint curTouchPoint  [self.view.window                              convertPoint[currentTouch locationInViewself.view.window]                              toWindownil]     CGPoint prevTouchPoint  [self.view.window                               convertPoint[currentTouch previousLocationInViewself.view.window]                               toWindownil]       Swipe and touch metrics         CGFloat touchLength  [SwipeGestureRecognizer lineDistanceForStartPointprevTouchPoint endPointcurTouchPoint]     CGFloat touchVelocity  touchLength  currentTouch.timestamp  prevTouchTime     CGFloat touchAngle  [SwipeGestureRecognizer angleForStartPointprevTouchPoint endPointcurTouchPoint]      CGFloat prevTouchVelocity  prevTouchVelocity     prevTouchVelocity  sampleWeight     prevTouchVelocity  1.0f  sampleWeight  touchVelocity      CGFloat prevTouchAngle  prevTouchAngle     prevTouchAngle  sampleWeight     prevTouchAngle  1.0f  sampleWeight  touchAngle      prevTouchTime  currentTouch.timestamp  codepre  pAt this point Im unsure how to validate the swipe.

Negative 5881 pI would appreciate some help to understand what is going on both Firefox and Chrome are failing to load my nonSSL website, say subdomain.example.com, with the following SSL errors both on ubuntu 14.04 i386p  ul liFF30 sslerrorrxrecordtoolongli liChrome 35 ERRSSLPROTOCOLERRORli ul  pThis started to occur after I set and follow a redirect 302 to SSL on the parent domain, say a hrefhttpexample.com relnofollowhttpexample.coma to a hrefhttpsexample.com relnofollowhttpsexample.coma. It gets back to normal after a full cache clean on the browser. But as soon as I access the parent domain I get the problem on the subdomain.p  pI have never entered the subdomain URL with the https scheme prefix. I dont usually type any prefix and it is happening even if I explicitly prefix with http. And it is not only on the address bar, the same happens for links.p  pI am very confident that there is nothing wrong with the nonSSL site on the subdomain.p  pI thought about filling a bug report but it is unlikely this is a bug in both browsers and more likely I am missing something.p  pIt there any rule that if a website on a given domain supports SSL or redirects http to https, then sites on subdomains are assumed to do as wellp  pI later found the cause of the SSL errors. But the problem still persists now the message is connection refusedp  pApache web server was configured to listen on both ports 80 and 443, but with no SSLEngine on clause. This effectively makes it serve plain HTTP on port 443.p  pIt is worth to mention that this Apache configuration mistake is not that hard to fall into. Actually, in the default Ubuntu configuration possibly the same for Debian, it is just a matter of enablingloading the SSL module and not providing a site configuration that uses SSL.p

Negative 5881 pYes. this is a complex question. i will try to nake it brief.p  pMy website fetches resources from s3. I also have an extension that needs to prefetch that s3 file when someone does a google query, so later when they go on my site ,the resource is cached. At this point I should probably stress that Im not doing anything malicious. just a matter of user experience. My problem is. that making an ajax request to s3 fron the extension either from contentscript or background doesnt send an origin header. This means that the resource is downloaded and cached without an allow origin header. s3  doesnt add that alloworigin if theres no origin in the request. so later, on my site it fails due to missing alloworigin header in cached file p  pAny ideas on a better way to prefetch to browser cachep  pIs there a way to force the ajax request to send an origin Any origin Since I have an alloworigin on my s3 bucket, I think any origin will do accept null. Thanksp  pEdit Ended up using one of Rob Ws solutions. You are awesome. Let me comment on each of the options he suggestedp  ol lipNot to add the host premissions on my manifest  clever idea but wouldnt work for me since I have a content script which runs on any website, so I must use a catchall wildcard, and I dont think there is an exclude permission option.pli lipI tried it, it issues a null origin, which as expected ends up in S3 sending the alloworigin header as required. this means I dont get that alloworigin header missing error, however the file is then not served from cache. I guess for it to be actually served from cache in chrome this has to be exactly the same origin. so that was very close but not enough.pli lipthird option is a charm. And it is the simplest. I didnt know I was able to manipulate the origin header. So I do that and set the exact origin of my website  And it works. The file is cached and later served from cache. I must stress that i had to add a Url filter to only apply this to requests going out to my s3 bucket, otherwise I expect this would wreak havoc on the users browser.pli ol  pThanks. Well donep

Negative 5881 pIn its simplest form, COM allows you to instantiate Clike classes from DLL in your application. Basically its a glorified wrapper around LoadLibrary and some conventions regarding the interface. This is called using an inprocess component.p  pBut COM also supports outofprocess components. If you instantiate a class from such a component, COM starts a new process. Your objects live in said process, and are marshalled transparently over to you, so you dont care too much about where they live. They might even be on a different computer DCOM. You can also fetch objects from already running applications. A wellknown example is controlling MS Office via a script. This is called Automation formerly OLE Automation, and there is a bit of confusion around what exactly this term encompasses.p  pThere are a couple of nice articles explaining how inprocess COM works lowlevel e.g. a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles6726COMfromscratchPARTONE relnofollow titleCOM from scratchCOM from scratcha. Id like to know how it works when your component is outofprocess. strongEspecially, what IPC does COM use beneath the hood to communicate between the processesstrong Window messages, shared memory, sockets, or something else a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa36557428vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMSDN lists COM as an IPC method by itselfa, but Im guessing it has to use something else underneath. Are different IPC methods used in different cases instantiating an OOP component from C, accessing an Excel document from VBScript, embedding a document in another via OLE It seems like it is all the same underlying technology. And lastly, how does marshalling fit in the picture I believe it is neccessary to serialize method parameters for transmitting between processes, correctp

I apologize if my question is unclear.p  pSo basically I have to input positive integers till I enter 0 would end the program. Im not allowed to use arrayswhatever that means.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt   int main   int number, count0  while1      scanfd,ampnumber     if number0              count continue          else              printfdd,number,count         break          return 0  codepre  pHow do I store these multiple numbers so that I wouldnt overlap the previous number and to increment duplicate numbers by 1 every time its entered I cant ask my professor for help he just tells me to google it.p  pA certain engineering apparatus is controlled by the input of successive numbers integers. If there is a run of the same number, the apparatus can optimize its performance. Hence we would like to arrange the data so as to indicate that a run is coming. Write a C program that reads a sequence of numbers and prints out each run of numbers in the form nm where m is the number repeated n times. Note that a run can consist of just a single number. The input numbers are terminated by a zero, which halts the apparatus.p

So I played around with the permission and set the ownership of the whole git directory recursively to user git. Nothing works. So I tried cloning a bare repository from the server and then try the push, but that didnt work either...returning me with unpacker error.p  pSo I switch my software to Git Extensions and also trying the push on Git Bash...still the same error. Oh, forgot to mention that in the process, I deleted my local and remote git repository various times.p  pWhile one may argue that this may be a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4819834gitpushoversshfsfailingwitherrorwhenclosingsha1filebadfiledescripgit push over sshfs failing with error when closing sha1 file Bad file descriptora, but I dont use sshfs and I am running Windows on my client side.p  pThis may be a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23128590gitpusherrorfatalfilestdoutwriteerrorbadfiledescriptorGit push error  fatal file  write error Bad file descriptora, but the push never works before.p  pUPDATE With mentioning about the version, I wonder if the version mismatch between the server and the client is the source of the problem. So I downgrade my client git version from 1.9.4 to 1.8.4.msysgit.0, but still found the problem after deleting and recreating a new git repository.p  pWhat interesting though is that I also tried to copy manually the git repository from the client to the server and do a git status on the remote side. As a result, I encounter the bad file descriptor, but that error didnt appear on the client side.p

Negative 5881 pIm implementing a library for a network protocol that involves sending data at a constant rate of 50Hz. The actual transmission of data will be done on a separate thread. As part of the library, there will be a class that represents all the data that needs to be sent, and the library will take care of serializing it and transmitting it.p  pMy issue is that Im not sure how to design this data class. The options I was thinking of werep  ul liSingle mutable object. The sending thread will lock the object, serialize it, then unlock it so the client can modify it again. I think this is probably the worst option.li liMutable object, that is cloned by the library when passed as an argument. This way the calling method can modify the existing object while not interfering with the send thread.li liImmutable object, so a new one will have to be created each time by the calling method, and repopulated with the data.li ul  pI was not sure about going the cloning route since a new object will have to be created and populated 50 times per second.p  pFor the cloning options, I was also wondering what the best way to clone an object like this would be. Should I take advantage of Object.clone, which I have heard mixed things about, or implement a custom copy methodconstructor If I make something custom, what would be the most robust way of implementing it Basically, Ill have to write in the code to copy every field of the source object one by one, and I was hoping there would be some easier way of doing it.p

Negative 5881 pIm having trouble with creating some sort of indicator on a webpage. This should show me if something is turned on or off. p  pMy project concerns on making a automatic terrarium controller, with sensors, relays and a raspberry. Im able to show the sensor readings on a website, updating every minute using jQuery.  At certain times, some relays are activated which still has to be done, relay arrived today and I want to see on the site if relay 1 is activated or not and again, updated automatically when this changes. The program to activate some relays is in python, and will also write a txtfile, containing a 0 or a 1 for off and on. p  pThen, using for instance a switch e.g. a hrefhttpcodepen.ioknardpenEBkJy relnofollowswitcha which should show the state of the relay, according to the txt file. But, I dont seem to get it working. Using PHP If and Else statements, ends up showing both even when using simple images as indicators of the relay.p  precodeltphp      myfile  fopen.statusUV.txt, r or dieUnable to open file     status freadmyfile              if status  1            print ltimg src.imageson.png gt          else            print ltimg src.imageson.png gt      codepre  pBut, how can different divs been shown, in case of this switch p  pOh, and I have to say, Im new to PHP, HTML, Python, jQuery etc.p  pThe button doesnt have to be clickable, it just have to show the state of the relay or the output in the file.p  pIf more information is needed, please, let me know Thanks in advancep  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt  lttitlegtUVlttitlegt   ltmeta httpequivcontenttype contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt   ltmeta namedescription content gt   ltmeta namekeywords content gt   ltlink hrefhttpfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyOpenSansCondensed300,700 relstylesheet typetextcssgt   ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.0jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript srcjsskel.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript srcjsskelpanels.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript srcjsinit.jsgtltscriptgt    ltnoscriptgt     ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssskelnoscript.css gt     ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssstyle.css gt     ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssstyledesktop.css gt   ltnoscriptgt    ltphp      myfile  fopen.statusUV.txt, r or dieUnable to open file     status freadmyfile             fclosemyfile     switchintvalstatus       case 0  img  ltimg src.imagesoff.png gt break       default  img  ltimg src.imageson.png gtbreak                                   gt     ltheadgt  ltbody classleftsidebargt   lt Wrapper gt   ltdiv idwrappergt     lt Header gt     ltdiv idheadergt       ltdiv classcontainergt         lt Nav gt         ltnav idnavgt         ltulgt           ltli classactivegtlta hrefindex.htmlgtDataltagtltligt           ltligtlta hrefUVtime.htmlgtUV timerltagtltligt           ltligtlta hrefheattime.htmlgtHeat Timerltagtltligt           ltligtlta hrefledtime.htmlgtLed Timerltagtltligt           ltligtlta hrefsproeiertime.htmlgtSproeier Timerltagtltligt           ltligtlta hrefindex.htmlgtApparatenltagtltligt         ltulgt         ltnavgt       ltdivgt     ltdiv idlogowrappergt       ltdiv classcontainergt          lt Logo gt         ltdiv idlogogt           lth1gtlta hrefgtTimerltagtltspan classtaglinegt voor Sproeierltspangtlth1gt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt   lt Header gt    lt Main gt   ltdiv idmainwrappergt     ltdiv classdividergtampnbspltdivgt     ltdiv idmaingt       ltdiv classcontainergt         ltdiv classrowgt           ltdiv idsidebar class4ugt              ltphp               if issetimg                 echo img                 echo status             gt           ltdivgt                         ltdivgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classdividergtampnbspltdivgt  lt Wrapper gt ltdiv idcopyrightgt   ltdiv classcontainergt     ltp stylefontsize11pxgtDesign lta hrefhttptemplated.cogtTEMPLATEDltagt Images lta hrefhttpunsplash.comgtUnsplashltagt lta hrefhttpunsplash.comcc0gtCC0ltagtltpgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre
Negative 5881 pSorry about the ambiguous title but I couldnt think of anything better. p  pIve been struggling with this issue for a few days and havent been able to find a way around it. A little background about my code I have a textbox codesavedInfocode and it stores values from different sessions. So if codesavedInfocode is empty, Id like to confront the user with another codetextboxcode. Once the user inputs info into the codetextboxcode and presses codeentercode then the code.valcode of the codetextboxcode goes to codesavedInfocode and the codetextboxcode is replaced with a label that has 2 buttons that appear when hovered. These two buttons give the user the ability to remove or save the codetextboxcode. p  pThe problem I am having is that my code doesnt seem to flow correctly. For instance, I have an if statement that checks if codesavedInfocode is empty and if it isnt then show the label text of codesavedInfocode. Then INSIDE the codekeypresscode function I check if one of the hover buttons is pressed but the code doesnt work since it is inside the codekeypresscode function. If I take it out of the codekeypresscode function then it doesnt work for when the codekeypresscode label appears.p  pProbably best if I explain with pseudo codep  precodedocument.readyfunction  ifsavedInfo.val      someDiv..innerHTMLltlabelgtsavedInfo.val  hover shows buttonsltlabelgt  else     Create textbox id textbox   function      textbox.keypressfunctione          if e.keyCode  13          set innerHTML to a label with text of textbox.          Check if button1 is pressed. If yes, then do something          Check if button2 is pressed. If yes, then do something                  codepre  pSo the button1 and button2 codeidscode are being created inside the if but dont work inside the if because they are inside the keypress. p  pI hope this wasnt too confusing. Any ideas on how to make this work better Thanksp

Negative 5881 pI would like to take any number of objects via a ParamArray and then add them, or variables nested within them to a collection. The tricky part is that if that nested object is a container of some sort collection, scripting dictionary or even a custom class with a count method also has variables nested within it, I want it to return those in the collection, NOT the container.p  pIt would go something like this, lets start by creating a use casep  precodeSub MakeItems Dim ReturnedColl as Collection Dim aString as String Dim TopColl as New Collection, NestedColl as New Collection, SubNestedDic as New Dictionary Dim aRangeofManyCells as Range, aRangeofOneCell as Range Dim anObject as newObject,  NestedObject as New Object, SubNestedObject as New Object   aString  Just a string   Set aRangeofManyCells  RangeA1C3  Set aRangeofOneCell  RangeA4   SubNestedDic.Add SubNestedObject  SubNestedDic.Add aRangeofOneCell   NestedColl.Add SubNestedDic  NestedColl.Add NestedObject  NestedColl.Add SubNestedDic  NestedColl.Add aRangeofManyCells   TopColl.Add aString  TopColl.AddNestedColl   Set ReturnedColl  UnNestTopColl, TopColl, anObject, RangeSheet1Sheet3Q1   For each Item in ReturnedColl  do something  Next Item End Sub codepre  pHere comes the part I cant figure out. I would want to do a loop like this making the Item the new Items, and then look into each Item within item if it has any, but without losing track of the original Items, because Ill have to go to the next Item.p  precodeFunction UnNestParamArray Items as Variant as Collection  For Each Item in Items      If Item is a container of some sort Then         some kind of loop through all nests, subnests, subsubnests,...      Else         UnNest.Add Item      Endif   Next Item  End Function codepre  pSo the end result should be a collection that holds  Just a String from aString  9 range objects corresponding to the cells RangeA1C3 from  aRangeofManyCells  1 range object corresponding to RangeA4, from aRangeofOneCell  The objects anObject, NestedObject, and SubNestedObjectp  pAll of the above 2x, because I put TopColl as an argument to the Function 2xp  pAnd also, an additional anObject, because I added that as an argument to the function 3 Range objects, corresponding to Sheet1Q1, Sheet2Q2, Sheet3Q3p  pI know thats a tall order, but there has got to be some way to do that loop. Thanks for any helpp

We care about the actual values in each column for the row, not the index, so thats why linspace in the next line is just calling on columns of the row.p  pTheres a good chance Im getting lost in the linspace part. So, I think the linspace function tells us well be wanting to create evenly spaced values between each rows loglower and logupper values, with the  of values to divide that range being row.freq im not really understanding what row.freq is here  is it the number of total rows in the whole df 41 could be wrong about this.p  pFYI if i insert a print printvals in the middle of that loop, it printsp  precode [ 3.          3.00016628  3.00033256 ...,  3.69855057  3.69871685   3.69888314] [ 3.69888314  3.69894682  3.69901049 ...,  3.99982921  3.99989289   3.99995657] and so on codepre  pNow given the nature of how loglower and logupper is defined, theres overlap at the end of each rows logupper and the subsequent rows loglower, with those values being the same  does the append function in the loop or numpy.concatenate later take that into account when making the array and cancel one of the overlapsp  pSorry if the question was a little longwinded, i hope its not too confusing. thanks guys.p

Different handler instances may be used to handle each messages of an MEP. Different threads    may be used for each handler in a handler chain, for each message in an MEP or any combination of the    two. Handlers should not rely on thread local state to share information. Handlers should instead use the    message context, see section 9.4. p      p9.4 Message Context p      pHandlers are invoked with a message context that provides methods to access and modify inbound and    outbound messages and to manage a set of properties.    Different types of handler are invoked with different types of message context. Sections 9.4.1 and 9.4.2    describe MessageContext and LogicalMessageContext respectively. In addition, JAXRPC bindings 12   may define a message context subtype for their particular protocol binding that provides access to protocol    specific features.

Negative 5881 pIn our system, we have 1000 tables, each of which has an date column containing  DateTime object. I want to get a list containing every date that exists within all of the tables.

Negative 5881 pI want to time ApplicationOnStart using MiniProfiler. So far Ive been unsuccessful.  I tried to create a Timing and add it to the children of the root, but it doesnt collect all the data I want.  It also subtracts the startup time from the overall profile time so it ends up with a negative duration.  Currently the only solution I have is timing it myself with a stopwatch and adding it to client timings. This removes the client timings from the first request and adds the application startup duration. But I dont gain custom timings, etc.  Also since I use the AddProfilerResults method to combine my API profiles within my MVC profiles for the MVC UI, they are wrapped in steps, the startup time for the API on the first MVC request isnt included, and its basically lost.p  precode            MiniProfiler.Current.ClientTimings  new ClientTimings                              Timings  new ListltClientTimings.ClientTiminggt                                      new ClientTimings.ClientTiming                                              Duration  startTime,                         Id  Guid.NewGuid,                         MiniProfilerId  Guid.NewGuid,                         Name  ApplicationStart,                         Start  0                                                    codepre

Negative 5881 pWhat is the most efficient in terms of processing speed and memory utilisation method for passing a large number of userinput variables as arguments to a function, and for returning multiple resultsp  pA long string of arguments and return values each time I call the function  e.g. a,b,c,d,e,f,g  MyFunctiona,b,c,d,e,f,g  seems inelegant, and Im guessing is also inefficient especially if I have to call the function repeatedly or recursively.p  pHowever defining the whole list of variables as Global outside of the function also is ugly, and carries the danger of variable names being inadvertently assigned to several different variables as my program grows.p  pIve tried putting all the variables into a single array or list and passed that to the function as a single argument, as this seems neater. Am I correct in thinking that this is also more efficient, even for huge arrays, since it is only the pointer to the start of the array that is passed to the function each time, not the whole array itself  If arrays are the best method for passing a large number of variables tofrom a function, at what point does this efficiency saving kick in  e.g. is it better to pass a string of arguments if the number of arguments is less than 5, but use an array or list if 5 or more arguments are requiredp  pA previous discussion on StackExchange a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24952190elegantwaytopassmultipleargumentstoafunctionElegant way to pass multiple arguments to a functiona has recommended using struct rather than vectorsarrays for passing multiple arguments. Why is this method preferred to using arrays, and at what point do efficiency savings justify the added complexity of using struct p  pAre there any other methods that I should consider which will work in Python or CC e.g. Im new to object orientated programming, but wonder if this might offer a solution which is specific  to Pythonp  pMany thanksp

Negative 5881 pIm testing a component that somehow reacts to a delegate it receives. Specifically Im testing that a certain behavior is triggered when the passed delegate throws an exception.p  pSince its a test, the life expectancy of the thread is very short. I thought about using AutoResetEvent to signal the main thread when the delegate is completed, but if I invoke Set before throwing the exception, I end up in a race condition that does not allow the test to be fully repeatable. A solution I tried is to invoke the Set in a finally block, so that the code is executed regardless of the exception being thrown. But I still have the same problem with the Mock.Verify failing.p  pRight now I use Task.Delay to synchronize the threads, but I know I can do it without blocking the thread for 2 painful seconds.p  pHere is the code of the test.p  precode[Test] public async Task TCommandErroryStrategyisinvokedwhenhandlerthrows      AutoResetEvent are  new AutoResetEventfalse      options.ServiceBusFactory  new LoopbackServiceBusFactory      var sut  CreateSystemUnderTest      var exception  Mock.OfltExceptiongt      sut.SubscribeToCommandltTestCommandgtmsg gt              try                      throw exception                  finally                      are.Set                    var message  fixture.CreateltCommandMessageltTestCommandgtgt      mockContextManager.Setupp gt p.CreateCommandMessageIt.IsAnyltIConsumeContextltTestCommandgtgt.Returnsmessage      await sut.Start      await sut.SendCommandmessage      are.WaitOneTimeSpan.FromSeconds3      await Task.DelayTimeSpan.FromSeconds2      mockCommandErrorStrategy.Verifyp gt p.HandleErrorIt.IsAnyltIConsumeContextltTestCommandgtgt, exception, Times.AtLeastOnce  codepre

If I encapsulate lowerlevel logic within method calls then it leaves the code reflecting higherlevel logic. This makes the code easier to understand because it requires less of the developers mental resources to get a general concept of what each part of the code does.p  pMy goal here is to eliminate the reader from actually having to analyze the implementations details of the code here unless its absolutely necessary. So instead of having to read through an entire method to comprehend it, the reader can instead get a more abstract representation of the logic of my code. p

Negative 5881 pTLDR Is there a way to swap the images reliably while showing whichever image is being loaded at the time without causing page flickerp  hr  pI have 2 images and 2 buttons and when I hover over one button it shows the one image. Hovering over the other button swaps to the second image. I was doing it like thisp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodebutton1.mouseoverfunction      image.attrsrc, image1.png   button2.mouseoverfunction      image.attrsrc, image2.png  codepre  pThis works fine but when the first image has loaded and the second hasnt, it doesnt show the second image until it has completed loading. To try to give the user some indication of when the new image is loading which theyre expecting to appear immediately, I forced it to add a null image before these swaps, like thisp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodebutton1.mouseoverfunction      image.attrsrc,      image.attrsrc, image1.png   button2.mouseoverfunction      image.attrsrc,      image.attrsrc, image2.png  codepre  pThis works great when one image is loading by showing the image as its loading but now once both are loaded, the null image in between them causes a flicker when switching images. I thought I could fix this by turning the null image off once both images are loaded but that has turned out to be unreliable. Both codeimage.propcompletecode and a hrefhttpsgithub.comdesandroimagesloaded relnofollowimagesloadeda as suggested in other locations on stackoverflow are inconsistent at noticing whether the image has been loaded or not. Detecting loaded images just seems to be a dead end.p  pI also considered trying to force the images to show and hide before and after they were created but this doesnt seem to work at all though Im not sure why.
