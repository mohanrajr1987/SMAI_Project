Positive 13423 pI have an issue, i coded my view, viewmodel creation into the ModuleInit.Initialize methodp  precodethis.container.RegisterTypeltIControlPanel, ViewModels.SeveritiesViewModelgtSeveritiesViewModel this.container.RegisterTypeltobject, Views.SeveritiesViewgtSeveritiesView, new InjectionConstructornew ResolvedParameterltIControlPanelgtSeveritiesViewModel codepre  pSeveritiesVeiwModel inherits from ViewModelBasep  precodepublic class ViewModelBase  BindableBase, IControlPanel, INavigationAware, IConfirmNavigationRequest codepre  pConstructor for ViewModelBase calls two virtual methods. Initialize and GetData.  GetData performs some data access methods using async await. p  pso the problem i have is Prism constructs my SeveritiesViewModel, the GetData method runs, and throws and exception which i catch. i would then like to display a dialog using the InteractionRequest, however the view.DataContext has not yet be set, hence no bindings or Interaction.Triggers to receive the InteractionRequest. p  pso i thought i should look into RegionManager.RequestNaviagte using a callback. i thought since all my viewmodels implement IConfirmNavigationRequest i could return false in the NavigationResult from the Viewviewmodel being injected. however ConfirmNavigationRequest is never called. this is wpf not silverlight p  pso how do i work this extremely decoupled application. do i need to implement some type of shared service  I guess i am going to need to store exceptions until the view has finished binding with the viewmodel, perhaps implement my own interface with a method to check an exceptions collection and in the view call the interface method  why is ConfirmNavigationRequest never called p  pInteractionRequest work great after the DataContext is set, but before im at a loss.p  pAny advise would be appreciated. p  pThanks  Garyp  phere is some code.p  ptoolbar button command click runs the following.p  precodethis.regionManager.RequestNavigateContentRegion, SeveritiesView codepre

The list of articles i.e. the codeModelcode class has loaded the articles i.e. the codeISubModelcodes from file. Thus there is no View model for each article yet. Different kind of articles have different models since they have different attributes, so they only share an interface codeISubModelcode with common functionality like is on stock, price etc..

Positive 13423 pI am currently writing a WPF application which has a navigation panel on its left side to which I bind a navigationViewModel and a content presenter on its right side which I bind to the previously mentioned VMs UserControl member CurrentView. For each item of this navigation panel, I created a corresponding user control and for each of these user controls, I bind an instance of a corresponding ViewModel.p  pClicking on a navigation panels items sets its ViewModels UserControl member CurrentView to the instance of the corresponding UC, which is then displayed in the content presenter mentioned above.p  pThe first navigation item is some select or create a new client form. When this operation is done, I would like to set some wide app resource id to which I would bind the other navigation items Enabled state. Thus, if the wide app resource is null, they are disabled, as soon as it is set to anything, they are enabled. There would also be some mechanism which would allow the corresponding ViewModel to be notified of this situation.p  pI am wondering if this would be considered a good practice  Furthermore, Id like to know if I can simply declare an int resource in the app.xaml and bind it to the navigation items Enabled property, would setting this resource to anything immediately refresh this property Or is there a better, simpler or cleaner wayp

Positive 13423 pIm trying to create a simple modular MVVM application with MEF. I have a ViewModel class and a UserControl as the View. I connect the two through a DataTemplate, like thisp  precodeltDataTemplate DataTypexType localMyViewModelgt     ltlocalMyView gt ltDataTemplategt codepre  pIn the View, I define the ViewModel as a StaticResource, to make binding simplep  precodeltUserControl.Resourcesgt     ltlocalMyViewModel xKeyViewModel gt ltUserControl.Resourcesgt codepre  pThen I bind like thisp  precodeltGrid DataContextStaticResource ResourceKeyViewModelgt     ltTextBlock TextBinding Text gt ltGridgt codepre  pThis all works as intended without MEF.

This is easily checked by setting a breakpoint in the constructor.p  pThe question is, how should I pass the instance created by MEF to my resource declaration Can I declare that specific instance as resourcep  pDropBox link with full code a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comshpbdl029d26sx7glAAA6po50dLjbJSoNPBhCyWZ3adl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comshpbdl029d26sx7glAAA6po50dLjbJSoNPBhCyWZ3adl0ap

Positive 13423 pI have a working program where the view model feed the data to the view. This is done in the constructor and also in a emRefreshem method, as shown below. I usually put a private property referring to the view model because I want to omit casting when communicating with it.p  precodepublic class TheView    private ViewModel TheViewModel  get set     public TheView        TheViewModel  new ViewModel     DataContext  TheViewModel       public Refresh        TheViewModel  new ViewModel     DataContext  TheViewModel     codepre  pThen, I got gready and started chasing lines. Since the constructor connects emDataContextem to the property emTheViewModelem, I figured I could just assign to the latter and the former would get its stuff updated by itself. To my disappointment, I discovered that it wasnt so. The following get me the correct list of objects strongbutstrong the emDataContextem stays unaffected.p  precodepublic class TheView    private ViewModel TheViewModel  get set     public TheView        TheViewModel  new ViewModel     DataContext  TheViewModel       public Refresh  TheViewModel  new ViewModel   codepre  pThe question is why it is so. Or rather, if its supposed to be so. Im thinking, in case it isnt supposed to behave like this, perhaps I have issues elsewhere in the code that poofs the flow...p
Positive 13423 pI am a little bit confused with usage of BindableBase class and how to apply this new mechanism to the classic MVVM design.p  pBriefly, the question is the following How to use correctly BindableBase class when we have reference to the model in our viewmodel classp  pstrongDetailsstrongp  pClassical MVVM pattern View lt ViewModel  Modelp  pAs we see ViewModel in this scheme knows about Model, but Model knows nothing about View and ViewModel. p  pIf we implement this approach, we will have something like thisp  precode Model class Task ...   ViewModel class TaskViewModel  BindableBase      private readonly Task task      public TaskViewModelTask task              task  task          ...  codepre  pLets imaging that Task class has Subject property and we should show this data. So according to MVVM I shouldp  pCreate duplication of Subject property in ViewModelp  precode ViewModel class TaskViewModel  BindableBase      public String Subject              get return task.Subject          set                      task.Subject  value              I cant use SetPropertyref task.Subject, value             its contradict c syntax            OnPropertyChangedSubject                codepre  pAs you see I cant use SetProperty method for such design and the only way its calling of raw onPropertyChanged method. p  pIt seems that SetProperty is the biggest benefit of BindableBase class and its very strange that we cant use it in such direct and common implementation of MVVM. So I thought maybe I missed something or work incorrectly with the specified class. p  pDo you know how to use BindableBase for the specified design and get some code improvementp  pThanksp

Positive 13423 pIm familiar with the concepts of MVVM and have used MvvmCross, but am trying out ReactiveUI and trying to wrap my head around some concepts.p  pIm writing a tool in WPF maybe branching to other frameworks for designers to create and edit data files that are then used by another enduser program.

Positive 13423 pAt work Ive suffered from quite a few memory leaks in a Silverlight 5 project so I thought Id run an idea by you for resolving this issue.p  pThe idea stems from implementing a Dispose pattern across all view models. One area in particular I think is a major headache as far as memory leaks are concerned are events, and therefore I believe this solution should address this nicely.p  pThe way I think about it is that this should allow 1 and only one subscriber to subscribe to events at a time. Meaning that the same object shouldnt be able to subscribe for the same event twice and having the subsequent side effects.p  pSecond, since I keep a reference to the subscribers of the event  when dispose comes around I can get rid of those references, regardless of the fact that the EventHandler internally keeps the same references. I get a chance to unhook the event completely by unhooking all of its subscribers and thus preventing the pesky memory leaks.p  pDoes anyone think this will introduce issues in the app I mean its rather large and I dont want to push experimental stuff without researching a bit more.p  pThanksp  pStart with the codeDisposableObjectcode base classp  precodepublic class DisposableObject  IDisposable    private bool disposed  false  to detect redundant calls     ltsummarygt    Default constructor    ltsummarygt   public DisposableObject       ltsummarygt    Object that inherit from this base class should override this method instead,    since its called from the Dispose method by the base.    ltsummarygt    ltparam namedisposinggtltparamgt   protected virtual void Disposebool disposing        if disposed            if disposing                 disposeonly, i.e. nonfinalizable logic                shared cleanup logic       disposed  true             ltsummarygt    Destructor    ltsummarygt   DisposableObject        Disposefalse        ltsummarygt    Implementation of IDisposable.

Negative 13423 pI have a web application that I am working onASP.NET 2.0 C. In it I have a GridView whose data source is an Oracle database. I get the data into the gridview in my codebehind, and dont set the datasource directly. p  pI wanted to create a hyperlink field NAME that takes me to a details page about a specific record. What ends up happening is that it creates the Hyperlink field as well as the regular field that it gets from the datasource, which I dont want. If I remove the field from my SELECT statement, it gives an error saying something like NAME not found in datasource.p  pHow can I eliminate the regular field, and get a hyperlink field instead I have tried codeGridview.Columns.Removecolumnlocationcode, but that wont work coz the columns dont exist there originally. p  pPlease Help Thank you.p

It provides some great features such as implementable interfaces and a really neat pattern for writing adaptors for objects. p  pUnfortunately, since its part of a very mature platform which runs just fine on Python 2.x the developers of Zope.Interface have not yet prioritised porting to Python 3. Id probably do the same in their situation. p  pWhat I want to know is p  pIs there another way to achieve a similar effect on the 3.x platform I want to use the same kinds of patterns that Zope.Interface makes easy but I dont want to roll my own interfaces system.

Negative 13423 pI would like an algorithm for a function that takes n integers and returns one integer. For small changes in the input, the resulting integer should vary greatly. Even though Ive taken a number of courses in math, I have not used that knowledge very much and now I need some help...p  pAn important property of this function should be that if it is used with coordinate pairs as input and the result is plotted as a grayscale value for example on an image, any repeating patterns should only be visible if the image is very big.p  pI have experimented with various algorithms for pseudorandom numbers with little success and finally it struck me that md5 almost meets my criteria, except that it is not for numbers at least not from what I know.

Negative 13423 pI have a relatively complex query, with several self joins, which works on a rather large table. For that query to perform faster, I thus need to only work with a subset of the data. Said subset of data can range between 12 000 and 120 000 rows depending on the parameters passed.p  pMore details can be found here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3054843sqlserverctereferredinselfjoinsslowhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3054843sqlserverctereferredinselfjoinsslowap  pAs you can see, I was using a CTE to return the data subset before, which caused some performance problems as SQL Server was rerunning the Select statement in the CTE for every join instead of simply being run once and reusing its data set.p  pThe alternative, using temporary tables worked much faster while testing the query in a separate window outside the UDF body. However, when I tried to implement this in a multistatement UDF, I was harshly reminded by SQL Server that multistatement UDFs do not support temporary tables for some reason...p  pUDFs do allow table variables however, so I tried that, but the performance is absolutely horrible as it takes 1m40 for my query to complete whereas the CTE version emonlyem took 40 seconds. I believe the table variables is slow for reasons listed in this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1643687tablevariablepoorperformanceoninsertinsqlserverstoredprocedurehttpstackoverflow.comquestions1643687tablevariablepoorperformanceoninsertinsqlserverstoredprocedureap  pTemporary table version takes around 1 seconds, but I cant make it into a function due to the SQL Server restrictions, and I emhaveem to return a table back to the caller.p  pConsidering that CTE and table variables are both too slow, and that temporary tables are rejected in UDFs, What are my options in order for my UDF to perform quicklyp  pThanks a lot in advance.p

Negative 13423 pIve recently migrated a lot of manual precondition testing and exception throwing with code contracts.

Negative 13423 pI have been searching around for a way to list the valid font styles for a given font using the .Net framework even if I have to pinvoke gdi32 or some other API since not all fonts fall into the System.Drawing.FontStyle enum values Bold, Italic, Regular, Strikeout, Underline.  A perfect example of a font that does not fit the bill is Segoe UI, which is a TrueType Microsoft font, with font styles of Regular, Semibold, Light, Bold, Italic, and BoldItalic.  Another example is Arial which has Regular, Narrow, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, Narrow Bold, Narrow Bold Italic, and Narrow Italic.p  pIn Windows 7 probably vista as well, but I dont have a machine to check when you open explorer and browse to SystemRootFonts you will see a column called Font style which lists out all of the available styles for each font, which tells me that there is definitely a way to do this, at the very least through API calls.p  pUltimately, I am looking to enumerate the FontFamily list, and then list out every font style for each family.  Below is sample code for listing out all of the font families, if anyone could provide assistance for listing the font styles available for each family, I would appreciate it.  If I am going about this the wrong way, I am definitely open to suggestions.p  precodeDrawing.Text.InstalledFontCollection ifc  new Drawing.Text.InstalledFontCollection foreach  FontFamily ff in ifc.Families       Console.WriteLineff.ToString      Something like this would be nice, but AFAIK nothing similar exists          foreach  FontStyle style in ff.Styles          Console.WriteLinestyle.ToString       codepre

Negative 13423 pStraight to the question and then the background.p  pWhat would cause a Notes 7.0.3 client to throw a JavaScript error Error in compile JavaScript  p  pFollowup Question  whats a good tool for tracking JS errors in the Notes Clientp  pMy suspcions  flaky JS written by developers  unusual input by user  memory management issues Win XP, SP3  corrupt Notes installation.p  pIve done my best to account for the first two and cant reproduce the error myself... full details below.p  pGoogle turns up nill for Error in compile JavaScript and Ive gone through my usual channels for odd Notes errors to no avail.  p  pRecap A Notes 7.0.3 client throws the JavaScript error Error in compile JavaScript when a form that has been compiled by Domino Designer 8.x has been opened and running on you guessed it emsomeem machines, not all.  Two users complained that the error would be thrown after 10 15 and 4550 minutes of having the form in Edit mode whilst doing nothing else.  Just edit and let in go, they say.  I got my hands on the same version of hardware and software they are running waiting for one to stop by to show me what they actually launch during the day and tried to reproduce the problem without success, even leaving the form in edit mode all day.  p  pThe JavaScript in question is pretty simple.  Event onFocus calls to a function that uses setInterval to track input field lengths to provide validation, but these fields do not need to be entered for the error to emerge.  OnLoad has a call to a function that does a replace substring using a JS function that was custom built and is widely deployed without incident.  All of this seems to be working fine for myself and our QA group which tested this thoroughly before deployment.p  pSo my thought is that there may be some memory issues affecting their Notes Client, or something has caused their Notes Client installation to become flaky, maybe requiring an reinstall.  Any ideas as to how this might be caused or how to prevent it would be greatly appreciated.p

Since ELMAH does not provide that ability I started looking at NLog.p  pA few questions came to mindp  ol liIs using both ELMAH and NLog overkill Using ELMAH for unhandled exceptions and NLog for everything elseli liIs it possible to configure NLog to log unhandled exceptions in the nlog.config or is custom code neededli liIf custom code is needed where would be the best place to add it The OnException method in the MVC framework The global.asax fileli ol  pAnny feedback is greatly appreciated. So far I havent found any good posts on this matterp
Negative 13423 pFrom what Ive seen, WPF images source is a BitmapSource object while the Resources images are read as bitmap. Ive easily found a way to convert images from Bitmap format into BitmapSource format but I believe that running this conversion every time I need an image is just costly in terms of performance and memory consumption The Bitmaps themselves are static but I guess that the conversion allocates a new object in memory for the BitmapSource.p  pI thought about holding an inmemory, lazy cache for the BitmapSource objects, that way I will only need to run the conversion once per image. However, I find it hard to believe that this is the proper solution for this issue.p  pThe nature of the application is that the data extends over time and the business objects are never disposed. Therefore, this assumption will only hold in case the implementation will hold static resources for these static images.p  pI will very much appreciate strongthe properstrong solution for this issue.p

That is, one that can have both static price and quoted price items put in the same cart.

Im leaning towards Drupal  Ubercart for its sheer flexibilityextensibility, but have reservations about its reputation for slow performance.

Negative 13423 pI have a page with a ScriptManager, a generic HTML dropdown list codeltselectgtcode, and an UpdatePanel.  The UpdatePanel contains a PlaceHolder for now.  During PageLoad, a number of user controls are added to the PlaceHolder really, its several instances of the same user control.  The number to add is not known until the page loads, so they do need to be loaded dynamically.  The dropdown list is populated with the same number of menu items, and there is javascript on the page also using jQuery to show only one of the controls at a time depending on the state of the dropdown list.p  pEach user control has two buttons that should generate an asynchronous postback, a dropdown list that should generate an asynchronous postback on a change in selected value, and a button that should generate a synchronous postback.

Negative 13423 pI cannot debug a PHP script as a script.  It always terminates immediately after starting.  I set up an Xdebug log in my php.ini, but its completely unhelpful.

Negative 13423 pI would like to do a lot of inserts, but could it be possible to update mysql after a while.p  pFor example if there is a query such as p  precodeUpdate viewstable SET views  views  1 WHERE id  12 codepre  pCould it not be possible to maybe store this query until the views have gone up to 100 and then run the following instead of running the query from above 100 times.p  precodeUpdate viewstable SET views  views  100 WHERE id  12 codepre  pNow, lets say that is done, then comes the problem of data integrity. Lets say, there are 100 php files open which are all about to run the same query. Now unless there is a locking mechanism on incrementing the cached views, there is a possibility that multiple files may have a same value of the cached view, so lets say process 1 may have 25 cached views and php process 2 may have 25 views and process 3 may have 27 views from the file. Now lets say process 3 finishes and increments the counter to 28. Then lets say php process is about finish and it finished just after process 3, which means that the counter would be brought back down to 26.p  pSo do you guys have any solutions that are fast but are data secure as well.p  pThanksp

I dont have any knowledge on XMLserializing so im trying to send each string in the arrayList to the client.

Negative 13423 pI am working in a MVC3 project, and i am using LINQ to SQL. I have a database schema that uses a field to indicate if the record is active or deleted field is boolean named Active. Now suppose there are two table linked such as State, and City, where City references State. Lets say i have a method that returns a list of statesp  precodepublic ActionResult ListStates     return Viewrepository.ListStates  codepre  pNow, i have implemented the repository method to return all states, and i could implement it in the following wayp  precodepublic class Repository     public IQueryableltStategt ListStates           return dataContext.States.Wherep gt p.Active  true      codepre  pIn the view i could be sure im using only active states. But to be sure im using only active cities i would need to filter it in view, which makes the view uglier, or implement a custom view model. Both cases are valid, but they require a lot of work. I have seen there are methods in data context where we can implement certain operations before an object gets insertedupdated into database, as this examlep  precodepublic partial class DatabaseDataContext     partial void InsertStateState instance           instance.Active  true       this.ExecuteDynamicInsertinstance      codepre  pThe above method gets executed whenever an insert of the State object is happening. My question is, is there a way to implement a condition only in one place for an object, for example to return only active records whenever a select is performedp

The matter is that my solution is not optimal like the one from recursive method. It produces redundant steps. For examplep  pI have 3 rods named A, B, C respectively and there are 2 disks named 1, 2 disk 1 is smaller than disk 2, disk 1 is on disk 2, then there are 2 ways to move all the disks from rod A to rod C using rod B as intermediate rod as followp  ol lioptimal like the output of recursive algorithm ul liMove disk 1 to rod Bli liMove disk 2 to rod Cli liMove disk 1 to rod Cli ulli linon optimal using planning ul liMove disk 1 to rod Cli liMove disk 2 to rod Bli liMove disk 1 to rod Ali liMove disk 2 to rod Cli liMove disk 1 to rod Cli ulli ol  pSo how do I more precise an algorithm which can be programmable know that disk 1 must move to rod B first instead of moving to disk C to gain optimal solution Ill really appreciate your help.

Negative 13423 pIm developing a WPF app and Im having an issue with popups.  I understand the issue that a popups zindex is higher than everything else.  The problem Im having is my app can have situations that there are more than one popups open at a time.  When this happens, the last popup that opens is always on top of the other.  I would really like the action to be, whichever popup gets clicked last is on top.  I have a thumb on the popup so it can be dragged and I have a behaviour to control the dragging.  I have noticed that I can call popup.isopen  false and then popup.isopen  true in the thumbdrag event and the clicked popup shows on top, but it produces an undesirable flash when the popup closes and opens.  Ive dug through reflector and tried several thing coecevalue on the IsOpenProperty, InvalidateVisual, etc. and am having no luck.  Has anyone had this same problem and been able to fix itp  pThanksp
Negative 13423 pI have an interesting but frustraring problem. I have an application which uses the full screen this is meant to simulate a thirdparty fullscreen POS application.p  pMy application displays a sequence of modeless dialog boxes on top of the full screen application. It shows one, hides it, then shows the next, hides it etc. After the 3rd show, the Windows taskbar appears about 1 second later. I cant figure out why. p  pIve stripped my code right back to see if its something Im doing in my OnNcActivate handler which I use to draw my skinned window but I dont think it is as the problem appears to be timing related. Ive tried running Spy as well as dumping messages in m WindowProc myself and I still cant see anything odd that would give me any clues.p  pThere are some messages with ID 0x36e in my logs but I cant find out what they are supposed to be. Ive checked various message ID lists and cant find them. They shouldnt be any message IDs of my own since WMUSER doesnt start until 0x400.p  pI know I could get around this problem by autohiding the taskbar but I cant ask our customers to configure their taskbars to autohide to get round my problem.p  pAny ideas why the taskbar would appear in relation to my modeless dialog boxesp  pEDIT I completely stripped out my selfdrawn GUI code and I still have the same problem. I could be wrong but it would seem that when I call ShowWindow SWHIDE first, Windows tries to activate another Window as it says in MSDN.

Negative 13423 pI am doing a small research on Unit Testing of EJB 3.1.  At the end my goal is to produce a easy to use solution for Unit Testing EJB 3.1.p  ol liI do not have much knowledge with big EJB implementations and hence I would like to first get some experienced hands You to just pool in your ideas on what is difficult in Unit Testing EJBs.  li liWith the initial research I have already done, I can understand the advantages of using mocking frameworks for Unit Testing rather than using embedded containers.  Though both are good, mocking frameworks stands a little above when it comes to Unit Testing.  The embedded containers are ofcourse very good and have their own advantages, but may be a different phase of unit testing.  I still believe that there should be some shortfalls at least in some scenarios in using such frameworks which can be improved.li ol  pI hope I could make a complete solution for Unit Testing EJB which I can share in this forum once done.p  pThanks for your support.p

Negative 13423 pIve implemented a specialised tree data structure for a ray tracing application. Im using an stdlist in each of the trees nodes to store data items. I have a problem where running the application, with this data structure in use, crashes not only the application, but freezes the whole OS Windows 7. This occurs in release mode only in debug mode it takes longer as is expected but works fine. Im using Visual Studio 2010. Running CtrlF5 or debugging F5 in release mode both caused the full system crash.p  pFrom what Ive found so far, different behaviour between release and debug mode seems to be attributed to memory leaks, as debug mode from what Ive understood is a little more forgiving. However Ive found nothing about a C application crashing the OS.p  pId just like to know under what circumstances such behaviour can occur, so I know where to look. Its difficult to reduce the problem to something simple and trace the issue, because its in the nature of ray tracing to be highly parallel and work with a lot of data.p  pOh, and the problem is emnotem an infinite recursion causing a stack overflow. I made that happen intentionally and it did not crash the OS.p

I also dont have the ability to download a product or buy one since this isnt exactly for me but its for my boss website, so please refrain from suggestions like that. p  pThe site is currently written in CSS and HTML, and thats also the extent of my coding knowledge unfortunately. I saw a few places where people used PHP coding, but every time I tried I just got a blank page or it didnt work out properly, or nothing would happen when I entered the password.There also havent been any really good detailed instructiosn on it, so I never know where Im supposed to put the PHP code does it go on its own page or is it integrated or how to connect it to the actual web page.p  pTruthfully it doesnt have to be anything fantastic, because a lot of the people who will be looking at this site are people who arent very computer savvy, just a simple form box with a password field. It would be best if there was a code I could put right into the HTML on the page. If I have to make a separate HTML page I dont mind doing that either. Theres going to be one password given to the Salesmen so they can acess the private pages while on the road from their laptops or tablets. p  pI saw something about .htpassword and another one I cant remember, but I havent been able to find any step by step instructions or detailed information about it detailed meaning info I can understand.... I saw also the thing about passwordprotect.php, but that requires a username field I think, and I cant really use one like that. There wont be a username, and sadly thats asking too much of the salesmen to remember two things heh. p  pAnyways, I apologize for my ignorance on the subject, and thank anyone for their help in advancep

Negative 13423 pOk, It looks like I  made a mistake with my initial question. So, here are some corrections. The answer still applies, because the second redirect is stopped when there is a change in protocol to HTTPS SSL.p  pIn my case, I have a redirect occurring multiple times, and the browser doesnt follow the second redirect. strongThe first redirect is followed but returns an error.strongp  pI keep reading that JavaScript AJAX responses containing redirects are followed automatically, but it look like not in my case. The first redirect is automatically followed by the browser, and the first redirect is returned without following the second redirect in the header. My problem is that I want all the redirects to be automatically followed by the browser.p  pThe redirects are part of the phpCAS library. I have an API written in PHP which checks the  user authentication, each time, before returning the results.p  pHere is the sequence. The main thing to note is that the browser returns the second response, after following 1 redirect. I would prefer it went all the way and returned the last response when I make an AJAX call to codelocalhostexampleapicode.p  pstronglocalhostexamplestrongp  ul liCalls codelocalhostexampleapicode using jQuery.ajaxli ul  pstrongResponse 1 localhostexampleapistrongp  ul liRedirects to codehttpslocalhostaccountscasloginserviceapi.example.comampgatewaytruecode using SSL.li ul  pstrongResponse 2 SSL localhostaccountscasloginserviceapi.example.comampgatewaytruestrongp  ul liWhen the query key gateway is present, the login simply redirects back to the URL provided by the service key with or without a ticket to signal to service that the user is either logged in or not.li ul  pstrongResponse 3 localhostapiticketTICKETstrongp  ul liVerifies the ticket and redirects back to itself without the ticket.li ul  pstrongResponse 4 localhostapistrongp  ul liThis time the CAS client looks at the SESSION to remember what the ticket was, and then processes the API request returning JSONP.li ul  pTheres no particular reason Im using CAS over OpenID or OpenAuthorization. CAS was just the first authentication module I was able to get working in WordPress. I am open to suggestions in terms of using a different authentication library, CMS, framework, etc. Although, my hope is to just get this project finished. So the less retooling the better.p

Negative 13423 pI extended the Zend Frontcontroller with a personal one and also extended the frontcontroller application resource to use my personal front controller.

In any case, Im getting the codeZend Frontcontrollercode returned to me instead of my personal one. Anybody know why my personal application frontcontroller resource isnt being used     p

Negative 13423 pIm working on making an Android application EDIT1 developing on 4.0.3 on Nexsus Ss that shares data P2P over Bluetooth and have run into a nasty snag on making the two devices connect. Our app uses NFC to pass the MAC address of one device to another. The sender then creates a BlueToothServer socket instance and calls accept, while the receiver creates a BluetoothDevice instance with the MAC address it received and attempts to connect.p  pThe problem were having is with the returned BluetoothSocket from accept. The documentation for it clearly states that it should return a connected socket, but it instead returns a disconnected one which cannot even then be connected by calling connect. Ive checked the MAC address the socket has and it clears out, and the mere fact accept returned implies that is successfully connected long enough to make the socket, so Im at a loss here for what else to try.p  pIt is also worth mentioning that the receivers BluetoothSocket claims during this time that it actually is connected. Obviously it just simply hangs while it waits for data that never comes from the other device, but using checkpoints in multiple places we know that up until that time it is always claiming to be connected.p  pAny help or advice on this would be appreciated.p  pOther relevant informationp  pThe sender and receiver are the same app, but represent different activities. This app is a game in which joining the game requires somebody who has the game to give it to someone else, which is initiated by the NFC the data that is ultimately suppose to be sent over Bluetooth is the game data necessary for joining. The sender has the game and is in an activity that gives it away, while the receiver is in an activity that wants to receive it and then move into the giving away activity to allow them to pass it on to someone else. To make this clear now, while it would be possible for us to merge these two activities right now, we are going to be using the same technique later on as part of the actual game where it will not be possible to make sure both are on the same activity, so we need to overcome the different activity problem at some point anyway.p  pWe are also sure that the UUIDs match properly. We have a global class with a constant UUID that we just generated at some point and use. It would appear depending on your purpose that UUIDs need to be something specific in certain instances, but so I have understood it as well, for this particular use, we were suppose to generate our own.p  pThe BluetoothServerSocket is created and accept called from it as part of a callback for NdefPushbackComplete, so the other phone definitely has the Ndef message before the sender begins to setup its server socket.p  pNeither the client or server bluetooth code is running on its own thread as commonly seen online, which is by design since we want the exchange to happen completely before either side can do anything else.p  pIf I neglected to mention anything important, I would be happy to provide it. Finally, here is the client and server side code. This version of it uses an insecure socket, however I have tried it both ways and the phones being used to test this are paired.p  pClientp  precodeString s  new Stringmsg.getRecords[0].getPayload otherBluetoothMACAddress  s Log.dDEV, WaitingToGetGame Other BT Address...       otherBluetoothMACAddress   Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, s, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show  Log.dDEV, WaitingToGetGame Getting remote device BluetoothDevice bluetoothDevice  bluetoothAdapter     .getRemoteDeviceotherBluetoothMACAddress  ObjectInputStream objectInputStream ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream   try    Log.dDEV, WaitingToGetGame Getting BluetoothSocket   bluetoothSocket  bluetoothDevice       .createInsecureRfcommSocketToServiceRecordSDPUUID    Log.dDEV, WaitingToGetGame Connecting...   bluetoothSocket.connect    Log.dDEV,       WaitingToGetGame Bluetooth             bluetoothSocket.isConnected  is   is NOT             Connected.

Following this line come with a single integer S, which will contain the number of strings to test, then S lines with the respective strings.p  pthe expected output is p  precodeTest Case 2 aaabcccc Rejected aabbbbcdc Rejected abbcdddcc Rejected acdddddd Accepted abc Accepted codepre  pThe output resulting in my codep  precodeTest Case 1 aaabcccc Rejected aabbbbcdc Rejected abbcdddcc Rejected acdddddd Rejected abc Rejected codepre  pHeres my code p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt include ltmapgt include ltsetgt include ltutilitygt include ltvectorgt     using namespace std  typedef mapltpairltint, intgt, chargt transitions     transitions trans      int  numberFinals     vectorltintgt currentStates      int main        freopen tarea4.in, r, stdin     freopen tarea4.out, w, stdout             int testCases, i, j,k, cont1,finalStates,numberInputs,stateOrigin, stateDestination     int numberStates, numberTransitions, initialState     char transitionCharacter       setltintgt current     setltintgt next     setltintgtiterator it     set ltintgt final     stdsetltintgt theintersection   Destination of intersect     mapltpairltint, intgt, chargtiterator p     string inputString      cingtgt testCases     for i0ilt testCasesi         cingtgtnumberStatesgtgtnumberTransitionsgtgtinitialStategtgtnumberFinals         current.insert initialState          for j0jltnumberFinalsj             cingtgtfinalStates             final.insertfinalStates                   for j0 jltnumberTransitionsj             cingtgt stateOrigingtgtstateDestinationgtgttransitionCharacter             trans.inserttransitionsvaluetypestdmakepairstateOrigin, stateDestination, transitionCharacter                   cingtgtnumberInputs          coutltltTest Case ltltcontltltltltendl              for j0 jltnumberInputsj              the code of the answer              current.insert initialState             cingtgt inputString             coutltltinputStringltlt         for k0 kltstr.sizek          next.clear          for  itcurrent.begin  it  current.end it                for q trans.begin q trans.endq                   ifit  qgtfirst.firstampampstr[k]qgtsecond                      next.insertqgtfirst.second                                   currentnext                                             stdsetintersectioncurrent.begin, current.end, final.begin, final.end, stdinsertertheintersection, theintersection.end              if theintersection.sizegt0                 coutltlt Acceptedltltendl                          else                 coutltlt Rejectedltltendl                                 printf n       return 0  codepre  pMy question is Why do I get incorrect output I think it is for the nondeterminism of the automaton defined in the test case, but how I can evaluate the string correctly.

Negative 13423 pI am thinking about creating an open source data management web application for various types of data. p  pA privileged user must be able to p  ul liadd new entity types for example a user or a family li liadd new properties to entity types for example gender to userli liremovemodify entities and propertiesli ul  pThese will be common tasks for the privileged user. He will do this through the web interface of the application. In the end, all data must be searchable and sortable by all types of users of the application. Two questions trouble mep  pstronga How should the data be stored in the database Should I dynamically addremove database tables andor columns during runtimestrongp  pI am no database expert. I am stuck with the imagination that in terms of relational databases, the application has to be able to dynamically addremove tables entities andor columns properties at runtime. And I dont like this idea. Likewise, I am thinking if such dynamic data should be handled in a NoSQL database.p  pAnyway, I believe that this kind of problem has an intelligent canonical solution, which I just did not find and think of so far. emWhat is the best approach for this kind of dynamic data managementemp  pstrongb How to implement this in Python using an ORM or NoSQLstrongp  pIf you recommend using a relational database model, then I would like to use SQLAlchemy. However, I dont see how to dynamically create tablescolumns with an ORM at runtime. This is one of the reasons why I hope that there is a much better approach than creating tables and columns during runtime. emIs the recommended database model efficiently implementable with SQLAlchemyemp  pIf you recommend using a NoSQL database, which one I like using Redis  emcan you imagine an efficient implementation based on Redisemp  pThanks for your suggestionsp  pstrongEdit in response to some commentsstrongp  pThe idea is that all instances rows of a certain entity table share the same set of propertiesattributes columns. However, it will be perfectly valid if certain instances have an empty value for certain propertiesattributes.p  pBasically, users will search the data through a simple form on a website. They query for e.g. all instances of an entity E with property P having a value V higher than T. The result can be sorted by the value of any property.p  pThe datasets wont become too large. Hence, I think even the stupidest approach would still lead to a working system. However, I am an enthusiast and Id like to apply modern and appropriate technology as well as Id like to be aware of theoretical bottlenecks. I want to use this project in order to gather experience in designing a Pythonic, stateoftheart, scalable, and reliable web application.p  pI see that the first comments tend to recommending a NoSQL approach. Although I really like Redis, it looks like it would be stupid not to take advantage of the DocumentCollection model of MongoCouch. Ive been looking into mongodb and mongoengine for Python. By doing so, do I take steps into the right directionp  pstrongEdit 2 in response to some answerscommentsstrongp  pFrom most of your answers, I conclude that the dynamic creationdeletion of tables and columns in the relational picture is strongnotstrong the way to go. This already is valuable information. Also, one opinion is that the whole idea of the dynamic modification of entities and properties could be bad design.p  pAs exactly this dynamic nature should be the main purposefeature of the application, I dont give up on this. From the theoretical point of view, I accept that performing operations on a dynamic data model must necessarily be slower than performing operations on a static data model. This is totally fine.p  pExpressed in an abstract way, the application needs to managep  ol lithe emdata layoutem, i.e. a dynamic list of valid entity types and a dynamic list of properties for each valid entity typeli lithe emdata itselfemli ol  pI am looking for an intelligent and efficient way to implement this.

Negative 13423 psorry if this all seem nooby and unclear, but Im currently learning Netlogo to model agentbased collective behavior and would love to hear some advice on alternative software choices. My main thing is that Id very much like to take advantage of PyCuda since, from what I understand, it enables parallel computation. However, does that mean I still have to write the numerical script in some other environment and implement the visuals in yet another onep  pIf so, my questions arep  ol lipWhat numerical package should I use PyEvolve, DEAP, or something else It appears that PyEvolve is no longer being developed and DEAP is just a wrapper on the outdated EAP.pli lipGraphicwise, I find mayavi2 and vtk promising. The problem is, none of the numerical package seems to bind to these readily. Is there no better alternative than to save the numerical output to datafile and feed them into, say, mayavi2pli lipAnother option is to generate the data via Netlogo and feed them into a graphing package from 2. Is there any disadvantage to doing thispli ol  pThank you so much for shedding light on this confusion.p

Negative 13423 pI have created a subclass of UIActivity to present a custom activity on the Activity Sheet within my app.  However I cannot get it to show my icon.p  pI have tried a few different images at typical icon sizes, e.g.p  precode UIImage activityImage       return [UIImage imageNamedmyappicon.png]   codepre  pbut I just get a gray square and my icon does not show at all. p  pEDIT the real problem was that my XCode docs were out of date, so I did not have the information that the maximum image size is very limited.p
Negative 13423 pSo, the title pretty much says it all Im switching from a singleserver ColdFusion install to a multiserver ColdFusion install, and session replication does not work if I set the application name. p  pHeres a strippeddown application.cfc that does NOT replicate sessions successfully.p  precode    component               this.name                 myTestApp         this.sessionManagement    true         this.sessionTimeout       createTimeSpan0,2,0,0      codepre  pAs soon as I comment out the application name, session replication works perfectly between my servers.p  pI believe a hrefhttphelp.adobe.comenUSColdFusion9.0DevelopingWSc3ff6d0ea77859461172e0811cbec22c24786c.htmlWSc3ff6d0ea77859461172e0811cbec142317fdf relnofollowthis Adobe help pagea tangentially references the issuep  blockquote   pIf you do not specify an application name in the This.name variable in   the Application.cfc initialization code or by using the ColdFusion   cfapplication tag, the application is unnamed, and the Application   scope corresponds to the ColdFusion J2EE servlet context. ColdFusion,   therefore, supports only a single unnamed application.p      pIf multiple cfapplication tags and Application.cfc files do not   specify an application name, all pages in these applications share the   servlet context as their Application scope. All sessions of unnamed   applications correspond directly to the session object of the J2EE   application server. If you do not use J2EE session variables,   ColdFusion ensures that the J2EE session lasts at least as long as the   session timeout.p blockquote  pIts obviously not regarded as a best practice to stop using codeapplication.namecode. But how do I enable my servers to make sessions available when using named applications Is there a way to register the application name in the J2EEJRun servlet context Id hate to set up a separate instance cluster for every CF application were running on the server that hardly seems like an scaleable solution.p  pI feel like Im probably missing something drastically simple here, not being a java guru, but any tips are appreciated.Willp

Negative 13423 pIm trying to calculate the width and height of child LayoutsViews based on the dimensions of the ViewGroup that contains them.p  pIm trying to factor in each childss margin value, but cannot seem to get this quite right.p  pIve tried every conversion under the sun dip, sp, px, in, mm, but still come to the same conclusion, which is that margin values get converted to a much smaller pixel value than any of the other dimensional values ie, width amp height.p  pI need this conversion factor.  Ive tried many things to calculate it Context.Resources.DisplayMetrics  Density, DensityDpi, ScaledDensity, but havent been successful.p  pI dont believe that this conversion factor can be taken or derived from any values available at runtime, and so was wondering if maybe someone knew what it was or maybe where to find or calculate it.p  hr  pTo give some context, Im implementing a custom calendar which contains a 5x7 grid of childlayouts LinearLists, where each child has margins surrounding them.p  pThe outermost view is a RelativeLayout, which has a width and height of W and H respectively, and the margin width is M.  Therefore, youd think thatp  precodeCELLWIDTH  W7  M7 CELLHEIGHT  H5  M5 codepre  pHowever the margin width factors M7 and M5 end up being much too large, causing the overall grid to be smaller than the parent view which is a problem, bc I need to fill it.p  pIve tried a ton of different conversion techniques from posts here and elsewhere with no success.  Im convinced that there is some conversion factor that android uses to internally store the margin values which Im assuming is in pixels.  It is this conversion factor Im after unless of course someone knows of a bettercorrect way to perform the calculation that Im attempting here.p  pHere are the links Ive tried, and I even converted one of the Java solutions to C and am currently using it though it did not solve this particular problem for me, it helped to shed a lot of light on it, and is helping elsewherep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8343971howtoparseadimensionstringandconvertittoadimensionvalue1271362412713624How to parse a dimension string and convert it to a dimension valueap

Negative 13423 pstrongMy Question How can I design the described classes in a better way without worrying about data integritystrongp  pI have a class PlayerContainer and Player.

I have some Pseudo Code to reflect my current Designp  precodeClass PlayerContainer  Method CreatePlayer, RemovePlayer , LoginUser, VerifyUser  Class Player Method None its a pure data container codepre  pNow for me the more I develop it seems wrong to have those functionalities on the TopLevelContainer but I seem not to come around this because the container will ensure that I can lock the object so that no parallel accesses can modify the usereg. User Builds something and sends this request twice and resources get reduced twice instead of once.p  pWhat I would like to havep  precodeClass PlayerContainer Method CreatePlayer, RemovePlayer  Class Player Method LoginUser, VerifyUser,.... codepre  pMy issue, how do I achieve that and still be data integrity save, should I just use the hashmap as index and build a Player level locking It would be cool to have some inputs and suggestions. What bugs me most is that the PlayerContainer actually needs to know so much about the Player Class, if I change an attribute I have to recode a lot in the Container.p  pIf something seems not clear please ask.p

Negative 13423 pIm new to network server development. Now Im focusing on the problem of determining how much data should be sent and received in a particular time in some specific network environment, especially when we are developing some network system for a company.     Ive been searching for the solution to this on some search engines. Some said we should detect the bandwidth with some programs. Some said some network interface libraries like ACE should be used to accomplish what I want.     However, I still dont know how the network application development corporations usually design the servers to implement that function. So can someone give me some hints     Thanksp

Even the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocshowtosandroidsdk3.0publishtofeed relnofollowtutorial to publish a wall posta assumes you already have the string you want to publish.p  pIts just odd that they provide the full signin dialog, but would leave it to the developers to create the UI for likes, sharing, wall posts, etc.p  pSo again, my question isdo I need to create my own UI to prompt the user to enter the message they want published to their wall, or is there something in the SDK to standardize thatp

So far i have given each instance variable its own paramname so that they are not using the default param of pagep  pExample Controller p  precodemeats Recipe.meatrecipes.paginatepage gt params[meatrecipes], perpage gt 1 vegrecipes  Recipe.vegrecipes.paginatepage gt params[vegrecipes], perpage gt 1 desserts  Recipe.dessertrecipes.paginatepage gt params[dessertrecipes], perpage gt 1 codepre  pThen in the viewp  precode lt willpaginate meats,  paramname gt meatrecipes  gt repeat this for individual instance variables codepre  pSo this part is fine. What i am doing is loading a partial when the AJAX request is made like sop  p.js.erb filep  precodemeatRecipes.htmllt escapejavascriptrender partial meatrecipes gt .setAjaxPagination codepre  pso at the moment my meat instance variable is working fine. So how to conduct an if statement based on params p  pI have tried this for examplep  precodelt if meats gt meatRecipes.htmllt escapejavascriptrender partial meatrecipes gt .setAjaxPagination lt end gt  lt if vegrecipes gt vegRecipes.htmllt escapejavascriptrender partial vegrecipes gt .setAjaxPagination lt end gt codepre  pAlso triedp  precodelt if meats[paramname]  meatrecipes gt meatRecipes.htmllt escapejavascriptrender partial meatrecipes gt .setAjaxPagination lt end gt  lt if vegrecipes[paramname  vegrecipes gt vegRecipes.htmllt escapejavascriptrender partial vegrecipes gt .setAjaxPagination lt end gt codepre  pbut this doesnt work. So i guess my question is what do i use as my argument to ensure that the correct partial is being called for the particular pagination section.p  pHope I have explained this correctlyp

Negative 13423 pIn the project I am working on, we are using ember.js 1.0rc1 without emberdata which is working out quite fine so far.

The API described   in this section tends to be stable, however. Until Ember Data is   included as part of the standard distribution, you can get your copy   from the GitHub page.p blockquote  pSo, to my questions and the input I am looking forp  ul lihow much do we losegain with this approach besides the REST integrationli liexperiences of somebody that actually might have started also without emberdata, and now migrated to emberdatali limaturity of emberdata and its integration into ember.jsli ul  pAnd there is another question, which might rather be for the ember.jsemberdata devsp  ul liwhats the roadmap to integrate emberdata into ember.js and how strong will be the impact on the APIsli ul  pThanks for sharing your experiences and giving some hints and advices.  php

These terminal communicate to a 3rd party TampA system via web service calls.p  pAbout the TampA web servicep  ul liHosted on IIS 6li liCommunication is with WCF over HTTPli liWere only interested in one of the exposed methods lets call it strongBeepstrongli ul  pWhat I need to dop  ul liLeave the original TampA system in place, untouchedli liWrite a custom service that emalsoem reacts to calls to strongBeepstrongli ul  pSo, essentially, I need to piggyback on all the calls to strongBeepstrong, but Im not sure what the best approach is.p  pWhat has been considered alreadyp  ol liWrite a custom webservice that implements the exact same same contract as the TampA service and direct all the terminals to that custom service.  The idea being that I can then invoke the original TampA service from my custom service, as well as applying any other logic required. ul liThis seems overly invasive to me, and seems needlessly risky.  We want to leave the original system as unmodified as possible.li ulli liWrite a custom HTTP Handler to intercept calls to the original TampA service. ul liWeve actually already done something like this in house, but our implementation takes the original HttpRequest, extracts the contents, invokes a custom service, and finally create a emnewem HttpRequest based on the original request so that the original web service call to strongBeepstrong is made.li liWhat I dont like about this approach is that the original HttpRequest is lost.  Yes, a second, supposedly identical, request is created, but I dont know enough about HttpRequests to guarantee this is safe.li ulli ol  pI prefer option 2, but its still not perfect.  Ideally we wouldnt need to destroy the original HttpRequest.  Does anyone know if this is possiblep  pIf not, can anyone suggest another way of doing this  Can IIS be configured to fork requests to two destinationsp  pThanksp  h3UPDATE 1h3  pI have found a solution documented a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma15478768569777herea, but Im still open to other options.p  h3UPDATE 2h3  pI like flups solution and justification.

Negative 13423 pHow can i change the resolution and stretch my entire game to the new resolution I want my game to have a base resolution, and when I change it to stretch to that new resolution. I saw a few similar questions but all the answers suggested that i should change the presentation parameters.

I am a beginner in DirectX. I googled the second method, but I couldnt find someone explaining it, and I dont think I can draw from a sprite to a surface.p  pEDITp  pI managed to do this using the CreateRenderTarget, SetRenderTarget and StretchRect methods, printing to a surface first, and then stretching it on the back buffer.p

Negative 13423 pIn a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10145693whatismeaningofapointertoaconstantfunctionrelated questiona its said that theres no such thing as a pointer to nonmember const function. In addition, C11 8.3.56 saysp  blockquote   pThe effect of a cvqualifierseq in a function declarator is not the same as adding cvqualification on top of the function type. In the latter case, the cvqualifiers are   ignored.

Although such functions are not const, they cannot be modified as per 3.106. In particular, pointers to const function are meaningless.p  pHowever, it seems that some compilers do create pointers to const function in type deduction contexts. For instance, consider the codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  void f   template lttypename Tgt void g      T  stdcout ltlt non const ltlt stdendl  template lttypename Tgt void gconst T  stdcout ltlt const     ltlt stdendl   int main       gf  codepre  pWhen compiled with GCC and Intel the code outputs non const as I would expect from the quote above.

Negative 13423 pIm trying to convince myself that clojure is indeed easier than java for concurrency programming. p  pbut I feel that the Clojure Refsdosync is almost exactly the same as java synchronized block. then I read this thread  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3583513clojurestmdosyncxjavasynchronizeblockClojure STM  dosync  x Java synchronize blockap  p I am restarting a new thread since if I comment there in the old thread, the response may not be high due to the old age.p  pthe first comment in that thread by Micha Marczyk  claims that the diff is  that java sync block uses locks while Clojure uses transactions. I think this claim does not touch the essence of the problem at the bottom, transactions are still implemented by locks. so java using locks is not the reason Clojure is better. p  pI think the real benefit is that Clojure transactions emmanagesem the locks automatically, just as DB transactions do. this way, the order to acquire locks, and the order to play transactions are determined by the transaction manager, so that programmer does not need to care about that, while in the java world, the programmer has to explicitly choose which lock to use for the sync block, which leads to possible deadlocks. transaction manager could use 2phase locking for example to avoid deadlocks.p  pdoes the above make sensep  pthanks Yangp

Negative 13423 pI have deployed an MVC 3 website on IIS of my Windows Server 2003 edition. I have set the authentication to Basic, Integrated, and Windows in order to enable site to use Windows authentication, and automatically log in into website if the user has launched the site from the same domain. If user access the site from another domain, it should prompt the Windows credentials and should allow user to log in. However the problem is that, user is presented with Windows login prompt every time irrespective to same or different domain, and also when user provides valid credentials it doesnt allow user to access the site.p  pWhat could be the problem here Or, can anyone provide me proper guide to configure IIS to use Windows Authentication while deployed on Windows Server 2003p

Negative 13423 pI want to run a process from script and kill it from another script using PID. I can think of two things to do but I think you can help me get more effective way of doing this. The first one is to store the PID in temp file and read it from the other script. The other way is to save it as environment variable from the first script and use it by the other script. I am very sure there is nicer way of doing this. I used killall and pkill to kill the process by the process name. However, this did not work good. I want to kill it using PID.p

Negative 13423 pI have bumped into a bit inconsistent IRQISR performance on Freescales imx.233 running  linux kernel 3.8.13 with CONFIGPREEMPTRT patches.

What I find is that sometimes I miss an interrupt  You can see the missed interrupt herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFys0M.png altmissed interruptp  pAnd also the the triggering of output pin seems to be a bit inconsistent, the output pin is triggered usually within 5 window, that might still be acceptable.

Negative 13423 pIm using the Winforms codePropertyGridcode the target of the codeSelectedObjectcode includes a property of type codeImagecode. Everything is fine, except that with all items the same height, the image is too small to see properly.

One other detail is that the codeSelectedObjectcode of one codePropertyGridcode control may be assigned an object of any of a variety of different classes which may or may not have image properties, so Im hoping the height can be driven by data in the instance of the codeSelectedObjectcode itself, rather than making it a static behavior of the control, although Id settle for a custom attribute of the image property to make the item height at least classspecific if it cant be instancespecific. p  pHow can I do this Custom attribute codePropertyGridcode event Something elsep

Negative 13423 pI am working on automation testing for a IBM Worklight application using the calabashandroid and calabashcucumberios gems.  Keep in mind that I am not a developer on the actual application.p  pMy problem is that Worklight names the android webView WLWebview rather than simply webView.  Calabash hates this and Ive gone into many of the methods inside calabashandroid and tried to remove the exceptions without much success.  p  pWhat I have been able to do is find the lower level methods inside calabashandroid and use these to access webView objects.  This is creating a layer of abstraction in my testing framework.  The iOS app created by Worklight simply creates a webview named webView and works flawlessly. p  pIdeally, Id like to avoid building this layer of abstraction.  Does anyone know if Worklight can deploy an Android app without naming the webView WLWebView and simply webViewp  pThank you.p

Negative 13423 pMost probably what I want to do cannot be done, but hopefully something similar is possible.p  pWhat I would like to do is having a matchcase statement in a method in a class codeAcode, creating a subclass codeBcode and keeping all the cases that are not overwritten by my subclass, so that before the final codecase code in the subclass all the cases of the superclass codeAcode are attempted.p  pAFAIK this is very far from being possible but please correct me if wrong, but something similar is not that far from being possible.p  pA maybe possible option would be to have a map of cases and functions in the superclass and expanding that map in each subclass. The cases should be of the type code[T1] gt Boolcode, the functions should be of the type code[T1] gt [T2]code, where codeT2code is the return type of the method we are expanding in the subclass. Then a loop should be run until one case returns true and its function is executed.p  pThe problem is that I am uncertain about how to define those cases code[T1] gt Boolcode. Having a match for each one of them may be very inefficient. This may also be deeply nonidiomatic and some other way to implement this could be preferable.p

I verified that SQL Browser is active and running.

Negative 13423 pIs it possible to display what modifications are part of the current build before the build has completed in the Web dashboard for CruiseControl.net p  pI have been trying to figure out if this is possible in the status. Sometimes I am asked if certain changes are in the current build and it would be just as easy to point someone to the server report and have them check. But currently modifications are not reported until the entire build is completed. p  pSo in the status, you would see that it successfully completed the multisource get source and under that it would report the changes. My guess it would have to somehow be tied to the modifications.xls file. p  pThis came to a head today as we were having build problems and there was a build that actually did not report a svn modification which is clearly dated earlier than the build start time. So there is no way to confirm if the change is in the build or not. There is no log file to confirm what changes were pulled or not pulled from svn. p  pThanks in advance.p

So basically there are few things to Change in the Deployment Scripts. One point is to Transform configs just as web.config. My Problem is, that we are using those web.configs with different kinds of comments. Like for testing different options etc. For that we also have Comments which are relevant for the Team in Production environment to switch different options. Those Comments are very relevant and we dont want to delete them in the process of Transformation. So the question is Is it possible to TransformCopy only Comments with a specific Keyword in it like Prod with XSL Transformationp  pAnd if yes how I Only found Topics to delete all Comments.p  pThanks for your help Roschp

Negative 13423 pIn Django, the ORM has a function called a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevrefmodelsquerysetsget relnofollowcodegetcodea which is used to return only a single instance of a model.

Negative 13423 pIm attempting to embed several sets of buttons and labels in a scroll view using Interface Builder and autolayout. Ive tried nearly every solution I can find but nothing gets the scroll view scrolling i.e. scrolling enabled  no bounces enabled  no movement. In addition, when I do enable bouncing, attempting to scroll down, while revealing the extra content but bouncing back up, leaves what is likely 20px more space at the top of the scroll view, as the content inset seems to get stuck at 20px in the y. p  pWhat Ive tried so farp  ul liSetting content size, content insets manually. Doesnt and shouldnt work with auto layout.li liSetting every constraint I can find to make sure the scroll view can tell how big it is. Content size at runtime is still zero. This includes sizing constraints on the scroll view and positioning constraints on the buttons and labels inside.li liVarious combinations of IB settings and metrics.li liEmbedding the buttons and labels inside another UIView, which is inside the scroll view. No change. li liRead the similar questions and answers here. li ul  pId like to avoid writing code to do this, as it seems like the tools should be able to do this, but I will if I have to. But Im at a loss I havent seen anything that would fix this that I shouldnt be able to do in IB just as well as code.p

Negative 13423 pI am using WordPress Platform for my website.And its growing constantly. We often ,do lots of experiments and customization on it.

Negative 13423 pI am building a COM addin for Excel 2007 which will be an application in the sense thatp  ul liIt has its own tab on the Ribbon with buttons that control its operation such as create new planning workbookrefresh workbook etc.li liIt will trap events from Excel both Application and Workbook and act upon them.li liIt should have a task pane which will be contextbased, and will have data sent to it from my addin.li ul  pIn order to support this I would like to structure the code in such a way that I can modify it relativley easily in the future for example, adding a new button on the Ribbon and not have spaghetti everywhere.p  pMy initial thoughts were to create a singleton class which would be my Addin Application and initialise this with the Excel application itself, for examplep  precodepublic class Connect  Extensibility.IDTExtensibility2      private Excel.Application excelApplication     private MyAddinApplication myAddinApplication      public void OnConnectionObject application,...          excelApplication  Excel.Applicationapplication         myAddinApplication  new MyAddinApplicationexcelApplication       codepre  pThis MyAddinApplication class would then trap Excels events such as opening a workbook, closing etc. and then act on them accordingly. It would also trap any Ribbon events or callbacks and then trigger actions based on a Command pattern. p  pMy question, is this a reasonable approach for an Excel COM addin Would it be better to encapsulate the Excel application in a separate event handler class which is referenced by my Addin Application class Ive not really seen a complex COM addin from my research, only ones which have one or two buttons or do not trap any events.p

It gets to a large error and become stable after k100. p  pMy question is what is the maximum k we should test in this kind of cross validation frameworkp  pFor example, there are two classes in the ionosphere data. One class labeled as g and one labeled as b. There are 351 instances in total. For g there are 225 cases and for b there are 126 cases.p  pIn the codes above, it chooses the largest k351 to be tested.

Negative 13423 pAccording to the Design for Notifications document, notifications can and should include a category when they are created. Categories include things like calls, messages, promotions, progress notifications, system messages, and social updates.p  pIn addition to enumerating the categories, actual system library constants are listed on the page, like codeNotification.CATEGORYCALLcode, codeNotification.CATEGORYPROGRESScode, and codeNotification.CATEGORYSOCIALcode.p  pHowever, these constants, and the whole category system, seems only to be mentioned in the Design for Notifications page. At this writing, the API documentation for Notification doesnt include those constants, and there doesnt seem to be any method like codesetCategorycode documented in codeNotification.Buildercode. A Google search for Notification.CATEGORYPROGRESS turns up only the Design for Notifications document.p  pDoes anybody out there know how to actually use these categories, and assign them to your notifications in L previewp  pbEDITbp  pA peek at the current Notification source code in the current aosppreviewl branch shows no evidence of the constants.

What are the crucial differences between the two languages that I should watch out forp

Negative 13423 pI have a problem. Im working on making a game. As part of my game I need images to be rotated and then moved in the direction of the rotated angle inside a game loop using an codeNSTimercode.

The object on the screen maintains its correct bounds and contents, but the actual displayed image disappears.

Negative 13423 pIm trying to experiment with llvm right now. Id like to use languages that can be compiled to llvm bitcode for scripting. Ive managed so far to load an llvm bitcode module and call a function defined in it from my internal c code. Ive next tried to expose a c function from my internal code to the jitd code  so far in this effort I havent managed to get anything but SEGFAULT. My code is as follows Ive tried to create a Function and a global mapping in my execution engine that points to a function Id like to call.p  precode    extern C void externGuy             cout ltlt Im the extern guy ltlt endl          void ExposeFunction             stdvectorltTypegt NoArgs0        FunctionType FT  FunctionTypegetTypegetVoidTygetGlobalContext, NoArgs, false        Function fnc  FunctionCreateFT, FunctionExternalLinkage, externGuy, StartModule        JITgtaddGlobalMappingfnc, voidexternGuy           ... Create module, create execution engine     ExposeFunction codepre  pIs the problem that I cant add a function to the module after its been loaded from bitcode filep  pstrongUpdatestrong Ive refactored my code so that it reads like so insteadp  precode     ...

Also, the result of dump prints declare void externGuy1. If I change my c script bitcode thing to call externGuy1 instead of externGuy it will suggest to me that I meant to use the externGuy. The addGlobalMapping just doesnt seem to be working for me. Im not sure what Im missing here. I also added fPIC to my compilation command like I saw suggested in another question  Im honestly not sure if its helped anything but no harm in trying.p

Negative 13423 pId like to send notifications to my app users, even if they are offline, such as you have a new task, click here to evaluate. I COULD send an email, but besides that ancient solution, is it possible to send a visible notification to a google plus user, using its offline token or some other fancy techniquep  pFor instance, I can create a Moment, but it is stored at an obscure menu inside google plus called application log. No one will even notice a Moment there. If I could configure a Moment to appear in an alert box, that would solve the problem.p  pAt the other hand, a google app cannot write at the user stream without the user hitting a button. That makes even less sense, because the user will not push a button to notify himself... Besides, the notification is for the user, not for any of his circles. I dont need to publish at the stream but that would be better than nothing.p  pCurrently my environment is the web.p  pThis is probably a newbie question, but I could not find any answer around.p

The AngularJS client received the first 128 bytes correctly i.e., 0,1,...,126,127, but the remaining values were 65535 in Internet Explorer 11, and 65533 in Chrome and Firefox. Fiddler shows that 256 values were sent over the network, but there are only 217 characters received in the AngularJS client code. If I only use 0127 as the server values, everything seems to work. I have no idea what can cause this, but the client response seems more in line with signed bytes, which I do not think is possible.p  pFiddler Hex data from the server shows 256 bytes with the values ranging from 00,01,...,EF,FF, which is correct. As I mentioned earlier, I can return an image and view it properly in Fiddler, so the Web API server interface works for both POST and GET.p  pI am trying vanilla XMLHttpRequest to see I can get that working outside of the AngularJS environment.p  pstrongXMLHttpRequest Testing Updatestrongp  pI have been able to confirm that vanilla XMLHttpRequest works with the server for the GET and is able to return the correct byte codes and the test image. p  pThe good news is that I can hack around AngularJS to get my system working, but the bad news is that I do not like doing this. I would prefer to stay with Angular for all my clientside server communication.p  pI am going to open up a separate issue on Stack Overflow that only deals with the GET byte[] issues that I am have with AngularJS. If I can get a resolution, I will update this issue with the solution for historical purposes to help others.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pEric Eslinger on Google Groups sent me a small code segment highlighting that responseType should be arraybuffer, all lower case.

Ive tried to fix and now I cant even reach codelocalhostusernamecode. It says p  precodeYou dont have permission to access username on this server. codepre  pCan you please help me with it.p  pHere is codeetcapache2httpd.confcode filep  precode  This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4gt for detailed information.  In particular, see   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4moddirectives.htmlgt  for a discussion of each configuration directive.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.     Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsaccesslog  with ServerRoot set to usrlocalapache2 will be interpreted by the  server as usrlocalapache2logsaccesslog, whereas logsaccesslog   will be interpreted as logsaccesslog.    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the  Mutex directive, if filebased mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the  same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at  least PidFile.  ServerRoot usr    Mutex Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory  for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults   Uncomment and change the directory if mutexes are filebased and the default  mutex file directory is not on a local disk or is not appropriate for some  other reason.   Mutex defaultprivatevarrun    Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.  Listen 12.34.56.7880 Listen 80    Dynamic Shared Object DSO Support   To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you  have to place corresponding LoadModule lines at this location so the  directives contained in it are actually available before they are used.

UserGroup The name or number of the usergroup to run httpd as.  It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for  running httpd, as with most system services.  User www Group www  ltIfModulegt   Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin youexample.com    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  ServerName localhost    Deny access to the entirety of your servers filesystem.

Example      Redirect permanent foo httpwww.example.combar            Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to      access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.      Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias      directives as to Alias.          ScriptAliasMatch cgibiniwebobjects.

AddEncoding xcompress .Z     AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz           If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you      probably should define those extensions to indicate media types          AddType applicationxcompress .Z     AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz            AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers      actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server      or added with the Action directive see below           To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories      You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.          AddHandler cgiscript .cgi       For type maps negotiated resources     AddHandler typemap var            Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.

Iv looked over it multiple times, and from what I understand it should be looping through the entire array size currently set at 10 and creating that many balloons, then updating and drawing that many. p  pAre you not able to do what I am currently doing with an array Would I have to create each object sparately p  pHere is the code of the two classes concerned.p  pGameLevel The class that creates the onjects and draws them.p  precode        public partial class GameLevel  GameScreen                      SpriteBatch spriteBatch             protected Game game              Texture2D balloonTexture              Balloon[] balloons  new Balloon[10]              public GameLevelGame game, SpriteBatch spriteBatch                  basegame, spriteBatch                              this.game  game                 this.spriteBatch  spriteBatch                           public void LoadContent                               for int i  0 i lt balloons.Length i                                         int colour                     Random random  new Random                       colour  random.Next1, 6                      switch colour                                              case 1 balloonTexture  Game.Content.LoadltTexture2DgtImagesBlueBalloon                             break                         case 2 balloonTexture  Game.Content.LoadltTexture2DgtImagesRedBalloon                             break                         case 3 balloonTexture  Game.Content.LoadltTexture2DgtImagesYellowBalloon                             break                         case 4 balloonTexture  Game.Content.LoadltTexture2DgtImagesGreenBalloon                             break                         case 5 balloonTexture  Game.Content.LoadltTexture2DgtImagesPurpleBalloon                             break                                          balloons[i]  new Balloonnew Rectangle0, 0, 1152, 648, balloonTexture                     balloons[i].SetStartPosition                                            public void Update                               for int i  0 i lt balloons.Length i                                      balloons[i].Update                                                public override void DrawGameTime gameTime                              for int i  0 i lt balloons.Length i                                       balloons[i].DrawspriteBatch                                   base.DrawgameTime                            codepre  pBallon Classp  precode    public class Balloon               Vector2 position         Vector2 motion            Rectangle bounds         Rectangle screenBounds         public Texture2D texture         float balloonSpeed  4          public BalloonRectangle screenBounds, Texture2D texture                                  this.texture  texture             this.screenBounds  screenBounds                   public Rectangle Bounds                      get                              bounds.X  intposition.X                 bounds.Y  intposition.Y                 return bounds                                 public void Update                      position  motion  balloonSpeed                   private void CheckWallColision                      if position.X lt 0                              position.X  0                 motion.X  1                           if position.X  texture.Width gt screenBounds.Width                              position.X  screenBounds.Width  texture.Width                 motion.X  1                           if position.Y lt 0                              position.Y  0                 motion.Y  1                           if position.Y  texture.Height gt screenBounds.Height                               position.Y  screenBounds.Height  texture.Height                 motion.Y  1                                public void SetStartPosition                      Random rand  new Random              motion  new Vector2rand.Next2, 6, rand.Next2, 6             motion.Normalize              position  new Vector2rand.Next100, 500, rand.Next100, 500                     public void DrawSpriteBatch spriteBatch                      spriteBatch.Drawtexture, position, Color.White                 codepre

Negative 13423 pI have a Shiny application Im working on. Part of it involves generating a plot using ggplot2. There are quite a lot of variables, so Id like it to be able to scroll pretty widely so that its readable. Originally I tried to adjust the size using     codeplotOutputplot1, width  Xcode where x is some number, and I can make it work like this if I know exactly what my codeplot1code is going to look like. The thing is, there will eventually be filters that will affect how big codeplot1code is, so I cant predefine it.p  pWhat Id like to be able to do is somehow tell R to say, use ggplot2 to make a barchart where the bars are all x units wide, and make the plot as big as it needs to be.p  pHere is the code in server.r that generates the plotp  precodeoutputplot1 lt renderPlot ggplotdata  dat, aesx  foo  geombarstatbin facetgridbar, scales  freex, space  free codepre  pand then in ui.r I call it like I did abovep  precodeplotOutputplot1, width  X codepre  pSpecifically whats happening is that facetgrid is splitting the plot up into different groups, and the user will have the option of deciding whathow many groups there are.p  pA possible workaround I thought of would involve somehow trying to count the number of bars that would be present and then coming up with a function to figure out how big X would be. In a regular R session this would be pretty easy, but in Shiny, I would need to be able to calculate a variable in server.r and use it in ui.r, and Im a bit confused on how to do that.p  pEDIT I may have figured out a workaround by instead of doing a plot, casting the plot to an image and displaying the image. Now I just have to figure out how to make the image fullsize, instead of having shiny scale it to fit the window. Any advice on that would be appreciated.p

Hence I cannot use codeSortedListlt,gtcodenor codeOrderedDictionarycode, which would have been the best choice as pointed out by lc.p  pAlso, my collection will only have a few 100 items.

Negative 13423 pSo my colleague is on holiday and left me with a project that uses coderakecode to control build while subtasks are executed by codeantcode. Now we also use codeant4eclipsecode, and for this to work, the ant4eclipse libraries must be present on ants classpath. I know how to do this in codebuild.xmlcode, but never having done anything in Ruby, Im at a loss. Theres no codebuild.xmlcode file that I can change.p  pIn the coderakefilecode, I have coderequire antcode, and then tasks are defined like thisp  precodedesc Java kompilieren task compile, [p, src] gt setup do t, args   puts t args   ant.javacdestdir gt binpath, debug gt true, includeantruntime gt false, nowarn gt true,     source gt 1.7, target gt 1.7,     compiler gt org.eclipse.jdt.core.JDTCompilerAdapter do     classpath refid gt class.path     src refid gt source.path   end end codepre  pHow do I set the classpath for ant itself not for the sources to be compiled, so that ant knows how to deal with the ant4eclipse stuff Id prefer to set this from within coderakefilecode since the project should be buildable an our Hudson installation without setting additional environment variables.p

Negative 13423 pWe are using classifiers to build two types of jars java6 and java7.  The idea is to keep them separate because of differences in dependencies.  p  pIn artifactory I see both of the jars with proper classifiers.  This is good.  However, in the directory I only see a single POM.  The POM always has the timestamp of the last built jar, eg code1.0.3020150325.2200198code.  This means that if I build a java6 jar, followed by a java7 jar, then the pom will be timestamped the same as the java 7 jar.  The timestamp of the java 6 jar will not match the pom.  So one of the two classified jars always has a different snapshot version than the pom.  p  pInitially I was using maven 3.0.3 and java 6 refused to resolve the jar.  However switching to maven 3.2.5 resolved the issue.  It was never an issue in java 7.  Furthermore, after switching to maven 3.2.5 it worked so I thought Thats how maven implemented it.  With a single shared pom.  p  pYesterday though we got an issue where a java 6 jar build was failing with a reference to the java 7 timestamp.  Even though the jar was there for java 6, just with an older timestamp.  This makes me wonder if maybe there is supposed to be two poms  Has anyone seen this beforep

Negative 13423 pI am writing my own big integer class in java without imports and need a method for doubling a number of any size that is represented by a string. The code I have for this now works, but begins to take a long time once the numbers get bigger and bigger. I essentially create two arrays the main array and the countdown array which both start as the same thing. Then, I run a while loop and increment the main array up and increment the countdown array down. When the countdown array reaches 0, I terminate the loop and the result is a new array with the new number doubled in size. Then of course I have if statements checking whether the arrays need to change the tens place, etc.... heres what I have...

So I cant even run the app right from XCode. p  pIm using php script to push the notifications. When the app first run on iPhone 6, it showed up a pop up alert asking for the push notification permission. On the devices settings, the app is there on the notifications settings. Ive tried revoking the apns certificate and creating a new one, regenerating the .pem files, reseting the device contents and settings, uninstall and install the app. None of these ever worked and I am already pulling my hair out. I even asked the Apple technical support for this but their answer is really just blah. Ive tried downloading an app from the app store that has push notifications feature. And somewhat the device can receive push notifications from that app. So, is there anything that I am missing here Can someone help me in thisp  pAs suggested, heres my code for registering the notifications.

Negative 13423 pSo to clarify, I know the client should send a message such as joinroom to the server for handling, and thats fine, and I know I can do the same for leaveroom.p  pWhat I want is to actually listen to the events themself, because say if a client disconnects, I need to send a message to the rooms affected, as when a client disconnects then they automatically leave all rooms.p  pSo I want something likep  precodesocket.onjoin function   send message   socket.onleave function   send message  codepre  pSo that if the user closes the window which disconnects the client, and then triggers all the rooms to be left I can send a message out.p  pI am using the latest socket.io, with the redis adaptor.p  pAlsop  pWhat is the most efficient way to list all the rooms a particular socket is in, as technically I think the disconnect event should contain the clientid so I could do this manually.p  pThe key thing is clarity and stability, although I am open to alternate approaches must still use socket.io.p  pThanksp

Clicking an option will highlight it and disable the other 2.p  pAll works fine in firefox or google but in IE11 if the user moves horizontally between each option and clicks a new one the previous option will also remain highlighted...I think this happens because it isnt updating the focus.p  pSelecting a new option and moving the mouse vertically above or below the table containing the radio buttons will work as intended and update the selected image while disabling the others.p  precodeltdiv idCreateLayerOption titleCreate Layer styleoverflow hiddengt      ltaspUpdatePanel runatserver UpdateModeConditional ChildrenAsTriggersfalse IDupCreateLayerOptionsgt         ltContentTemplategt             ltdiv stylefloatrightgt             lta href..Helpquickazimap20documentaton.htmlCreatingaLayer.html targetOpenWindowCreatingaLayergtltimg alt src....imagesHelpIcon2.png gtltagt             ltdivgt             ltbr gt              lttable width100gt                 lttrgt                     lttd width100pxgt                         ltdiv radiobuttongroupCreateLayer rbItemSelectedtrue tagNew Layergtltdivgt                         ltdiv classRadioButtonNewLayerTextgt                             New Layer                         ltdivgt                      lttdgt                     lttd width100pxgt                         ltdiv radiobuttongroupCreateLayer rbItemSelectedfalse tagImport Layergtltdivgt                         ltdiv classRadioButtonNewLayerTextgt                             Import Layer                         ltdivgt                     lttdgt                     lttd width100pxgt                         ltdiv radiobuttongroupCreateLayer rbItemSelectedfalse tagExternal Datagtltdivgt                         ltdiv classRadioButtonNewLayerTextgt                            External Data                         ltdivgt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt              lttablegt                ltbr gt             ltbr gt             ltdiv stylefloatrightgt                 ltinput idbtnNextClient valueNext classedit green btn onclickbtnNextCreateLayerClientClick stylewidth70pxgt             ltdivgt         ltContentTemplategt         ltTriggersgt             ltaspAsyncPostBackTrigger ControlIDbtnNextCreateLayer EventNameClick gt         ltTriggersgt     ltaspUpdatePanelgt ltdivgt codepre  plooks like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compXDcX.png altenter image description herep  pthe idea being that upon clicking an icon, sets all icons to false and updates the chosen icon to the selected onep  precode function BindCreateLayerOptionClick         div[radiobuttongroupCreateLayer].clickfunction                div[radiobuttongroupCreateLayer].eachfunction                   this.attrrbItemSelected, false                           this.attrrbItemSelected, true                          codepre  pto resolve this I have tried setting the next button as the focus upon every clickp  precodethis.attrrbItemSelected, true              btnNextClient.setFocus           codepre  pbut to no avail, have also tried using using setAttributep  precodevar itemTemp  this  itemTemp.setAttributerbItemSelected, false codepre  pbut that didnt work either...anyone any idea on how to update the focus of what image is selected without moving outside the table holding the radio button groups...thanks for any feedbackp

I need the cookies loaded before opening the page.

Unfortunately, this doesnt seem to save the cookies.p

Negative 13423 pI have to find the camera position using several images from a football field. Using these images I can find the homography that transforms the points in the 3D model in meters into the points in the image pixels. Each picture can have a different focal lengths, hence the camera intrinsics can change. Im using OpenCV in C.p  pIve found solutions for similar problems but either a hrefhttpdsp.stackexchange.comquestions2736stepbystepcameraposeestimationforvisualtrackingandplanarmarkersyou already have the camera calibrated, with a fixed focal lengtha in this case you only need one image or a hrefhttpwww.epixea.comresearchmultiviewcodingthesisse9.html relnofollowyou dont have the camera calibrated but you consider that its intrinsic doesnt changea in this case you need at least 3 images. p  pIs there anyway to find the camera position in the 3D model without knowing anything besides the homographies with different focal lengthsp

Negative 13423 pI am trying to upload an image from customer product page upload file option, the image is uploaded to codesystemuploadcode folder and renamed with filename  md5 hash string. So, for example I upload codeimage.jpgcode, the file will be uploaded to codesystemuploadimage.jpg.392da1267fbfa4be65f7859bb0b974d9code.p  pNow I want to see that image uploaded by customer from admin page I created a new module page, how can I resize and display the image file I can get the file name from table codeocuploadcode in database, but the phisical file is using modified name which has no extension, I cannot resize this file because it is located in codesystemuploadcode folder and its extension is changed. The image resize tool can only resize images in codeimagecode folder with some allowed extensions configured in Settings page.p  pAny idea how to display images uploaded by customer Do I need to copy the renamed uploaded file to codeimagecode folder using its original name and then resize and display it I appreciate any of your ideas. Thank you.p

Negative 13423 pI am developing a project in which I would like to use Maven to execute a Java Main class as part of the build process.  The Main classs job is to validate that some given currently hardcoded files are valid RAML files.  In a perfect world, I would like the build to be able to fail the build from within this classs logic, if they are invalid, and have that failure report back to the terminal with the [BUILD FAILURE] message just like maven does natively.p  pI added tho org.codehaus.mojo.execmavenplugin plugin to my POM, which is allowing me to execute the Java Main class I mentioned earlier.  That section of the POM looks like thisp  precodeltplugingt      ltgroupIdgtorg.codehaus.mojoltgroupIdgt      ltartifactIdgtexecmavenpluginltartifactIdgt      ltversiongt1.4.0ltversiongt      ltexecutionsgt       ltexecutiongt        ltphasegttestltphasegt        ltgoalsgt         ltgoalgtjavaltgoalgt        ltgoalsgt        ltconfigurationgt       ltmainClassgtcom.example.ubunfu.MainClassltmainClassgt         ltargumentsgt          ltargumentgtltargumentgt       ltargumentsgt       ltcleanupDaemonThreadsgtfalseltcleanupDaemonThreadsgt lt Prevents thread hanging gt      ltconfigurationgt       ltexecutiongt      ltexecutionsgt     ltplugingt codepre  pHowever, Im not sure how to signal from the logic inside of MainClass that the build should fail  if thats necessary.

Negative 13423 h3Scenarioh3  pMy target platform is ARM cortexA7 with VFPneon enabled, where my system software running on the target platform does not always turn VPFneon on but turn on VPFneon only on demand by calling some system API.br My tool chain is a baremetal GCC4.7.4 crosscompiler on pccygwin host armnoneeabi.  p  pWe have a C source file codea.ccode, the code may run when system software turns VPFneon off.  This codea.ccode code is strongpure integerstrong with intensive codelong longcode 64bit integer operations.  If applying the GCC option codemfloatabihardcode or codemfloatabisoftfpcode to compile codea.ccode, some instructions to use VFPneon registers will be generated such as, codevldr d7,[..]code, codevstr d7,[sp,..]code, etc.  If running this generated code when VFPneon is off, an undefined fault happens on target platform.  If applying the GCC option codemfloatabisoftcode to compile codea.ccode, no VFPneon register will be used and solve the undefined fault problem.  p  pOn the other hand, there is another C source file codeb.ccode, which contains floating pointsvectors VFPneon operations and runs only if when system software turns on VFPneon.  Id like to compile codeb.ccode with the GCC option codemfloatabihardcode instead of codemfloatabisoftfpcode for performance reason.  p  pIf codeb.ccode is compiled with codemfloatabihardcode and codea.ccode is compiled with codemfloatabisoftcode option, they cannot be linked together and the linker will complain ...Uses VFP register arguments, XXX does not.  p  h3Questionh3  pIs there any way with tool chain GCC options, installation configurations, versions to compile the said pure integer codea.ccode compatible with hardfloat ABI passing floating point arguments via VFPneon registers but without generating any VFPneon instruction or register for pure integer operationsp  h3Notesh3  ul liAs a workaround, codea.ccode with option codemfloatabisoftcode and codeb.ccode with option codemfloatabisoftfpcode can be linked, but poorer performance is not desirable.li liThe a hrefhttpsgcc.gnu.orggcc4.9changes.html relnofollowGCC 4.9 release notesa said .. Use of Advanced SIMD Neon for 64bit scalar computations has been disabled by default. This was found to generate better code in only a small number of cases.

Negative 13423 pI have an unordered list codeltulgtcode with many codeltligtcode elements. The codeltulgtcode element has a width of 100, which fits 1 to n number of codeltligtcode inlineblock elements next to one another, depending on the browser window size. Therefore, the list contains x number of lines each with n number of elements.p  pGiven one element, using jQuery I would like to select all other elements in the same line. How can I do thatp  pIn this image, I show 2 cases with different browser window sizes. The elements I want to select are highlighted in green. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comsxKWT.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsxKWT.jpg altenter image description hereap
Negative 13423 pIm facing a weird problem. Im working on magento mobile theme 1.7. We have a header with a checkout icon pointing to  a hrefhttpsitename.comcheckoutonepage relnofollowhttpsitename.comcheckoutonepageap  pWhen the user visits the site, a popup is shown for login. When he logins, the page simply reloads and if he has cart items, we show the checkout icon which links to the above given url.p  pThe problem is, for the first time when user clicks the link, it redirects to a hrefhttpsitename.comcheckoutcart relnofollowhttpsitename.comcheckoutcarta. p  pThe cart page again has the same link. If the user clicks again on the checkout link, it moves to proper url a hrefhttpsitename.comcheckoutonepage relnofollowhttpsitename.comcheckoutonepageap  pIm not able to find why it is moving to the cart url for the first time instead of going to onepage. And why it is moving to onepage for any other time.p  pPlease help me on thisp  pThanksp
