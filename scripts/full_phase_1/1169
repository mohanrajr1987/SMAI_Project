Positive 1169 pI am creating a user control which contains 2 ListView controls. I want the user to be able to use Designer to set the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controlsbasically, the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controls are to be synced to each other, using the exact same ColumnHeader collections.p  pFor the user control itself, in order for the Columns property to work properly as a collection of column headers, I find I must inherit from System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection. I set the collection class to Serializable and the class property to DesignerSerializationVisibilityDesignerSerializationVisibility.Content. When I do this, and use the user control on a form and add columns to the Columns property, I find in the forms Designer in InitializeComponents that the Add method of the collection class is used to add the ColumnHeader variables created. This works.p  pWhat I have trouble doing, however, is syncing the Columns collection property with the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls. For the inherited collection class inherited from Collection, I cannot override the Add method, so I cant set the Add method to also add the ColumnHeader to the Columns properties of the 2 Listview controls.p  pHow do I assure that the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls always change to match changes in the user controls Columns propertyp

But the button list control will be used in another user control, namely inputcontrol. The inputcontrol will wrap a label, a textbox and my button list control.

Negative 1169 pI would like to be able to display some dynamic text at the mouse  cursor location in a win32 app, for instance to give an X,Y coordinate that  would move with the cursor as though attached.

Is there a better way to do this, perhaps using the existing cursor  drawinginvalidating mechanism  p

Negative 1169 pI have written a simple a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBrainfuckbrainfucka interpreter in MATLAB script language. It is fed random bf programs to execute as part of a genetic algorithm project. The problem I face is, the program turns out to have an infinite loop in a sizeable number of cases, and hence the GA gets stuck at the point.br  So, I need a mechanism to detect infinite loops and avoid executing that code in bf.br  One obvious trivial case is when I havep  precode[] codepre  pI can detect this and refuse to run that program.br  For the nontrivial cases, I figured out that the basic idea is to determine how one iteration of the loop changes the current cell. If the change is negative, were eventually going to reach 0, so its a finite loop. Otherwise, if the change is nonnegative, its an infinite loop.br  Implementing this is easy for the case of a single loop, but with nested loops it becomes very complicated. For example, in what follows 1 refers to contents of cell 1, etc. p  precode Put 4 in 1st cell 1 gt Put 3 in 2 lt[   While 1 is non zero        Decrease 1 by 2     gt[   While 2 is non zero             Decrement 2         lt   Increment 1      gt]        2 would be 0 at this point       Increase 2 by 3 making 2  3 lt]   1 was decreased by 2 and then increased by 3, so net effect is increment codepre  pand hence the code runs on and on. A naive check of the number of s and s done on cell 1, however, would say the number of s is more, so would not detect the infinite loop.br  Can anyone think of a good algorithm to detect infinite loops, given arbitrary nesting of arbitrary number of loops in bfp  pEDIT I do know that the halting problem is unsolvable in general, but I was not sure whether there did not exist special case exceptions. Like, maybe Matlab might function as a Super Turing machine able to determine the halting of the bf program. I might be horribly wrong, but if so, I would like to know exactly how and why. p  pSECOND EDIT I have written what I purport to be infinite loop detector. It probably misses some edge cases or less probably, somehow escapes Mr. Turings clutches, but seems to work for me as of now.  In pseudocode form, here it goesp  precodesubroutine bfexecbfprogram begin     Looping through the bfprogram,     Ifcurrent character is [     Find the corresponding ]     Store the code between the two brackets in, say, subprog     Save the value of the current cell in oldval     Call bfexec recursively with subprog     Save the value of the current cell in newval     Ifnewval gt oldval     Raise an infinite loop error and exit     EndIf      Do other characters processings      EndIf     EndLoop end codepre

Negative 1169 pIve been integrating the a hrefhttpssubstance.dev.java.netSubstancea look and feel into my application and ran into several problems regarding its internal EDT Event Dispatch Thread checking routines. Substance absolutely refuses to construct UI classes outside of the EDT. Ive done plenty of SwingAWT and I know most of the rules regarding the EDT. I use SwingWorker, SwingUtilties.invokeLater to modify components. I always though that components could be strongemCONSTRUCTEDemstrong outside of the EDT, but must be strongemrealizedemstrong and strongemmanipulatedemstrong on the EDT. In other words, you can construct and setup defaults in the background but the call to packsetVisible must be EDT as well as any subsequent calls to manipulate the component.p  pThe reason I ask is that I have a particularly beefy window to construct, involving many widgets, state, and resources lots of icons. Previously, I constructed the window on the background method of a SwingWorker and made the window visible in the done method. Never had a single problem. Upon switching to Substance, the internal EDT checking bites me.p  pIve been able to refactor code to get around this. I can construct on the EDT which isnt a good solution since the entire application will block. I can also refactor even more and try my best to load all of the extra resources outside of the EDT.p  pWrapping it up ... Is it safe to strongemconstructemstrong SwingAWT widgets NOT on the Event Dispatch Threadp

Negative 1169 pIm a former classic ASP programmer and sometimes PHP programmer writing my first ASP.NET application. Im loving the muchimproved ADO.NET functions, but Im feeling the need to write a database class. Partly I want to consolidate the code that actually interacts with the database, and partly I want to reduce what feels like repetition.p  pA simple database class is not hard to do, but Im using parameterized queries as one of my security measures. Im struggling with how to incorporate this into a class. I wrote a function to return the datatype of a column in the database by passing in the table and column name, but I cant think of a robust way to obtain the table and column name from the SQL query.p  pMy design for the class was to have a Query function for selecting, and an Execute function for insertupdatedelete. Not opposed to having more public functions, but didnt want to get ahead of myself. Both functions take a SQL string and a SortedList for the parameters. It might be possible to get the column name by finding the parameter name in the SQL string and looking in front of the equal sign. Likewise, it should be fairly simple to get the table name when the query is insert, update, or delete, because you only work with one table at a time. The big concern is selecting, because there could be one or more joins, inner selects, etc.p  pAm I headed in the wrong direction Anything Im not thinking of that could make my life easier or more difficult Anybody written a class for this in any language that could offer some advicep

Negative 1169 pThis was a hard question for me to summarize so we may need to edit this a bit.p  h2Backgroundh2  pAbout four years ago, we had to translate our asp.net application for our clients in Mexico. Extensibility and scalability were not that much of a concern at the time oh yes, I just said those dreadful words because we only have U.S. and Mexican customers.p  pRather than use resource files, we replaced every single piece of static text in our application with some type of server control asp.net label for example. We store each and every English word in a SQL database. We have added the ability to translate the English text into another language and also can add cultural overrides. For example, stronghellostrong can be translated to strongholastrong in one language and overridden to strongbuenostrong in a different culture. The business has full control over these translations because will built management utilities for them to control everything. The translation kicks in when we detect that the user has a browser culture other than enus. Every form descends from a base form that iterates through each server control and executes a translation translation data is stored as a datatable in an application variable for a culture. Im still amazed at how fast the control iteration is.p  h2The problemh2  pThe business is very happy with how the translations work. In addition to the static content that I mentioned above, the business now wants to have certain data translated as well. System notes are a good example of a translation they want. Example emSent Letter XXXXem to Customer  the business wants the Sent Letter to Customer text translated based on their browser culture.p  pI have read a couple of other posts on SO that talk about localization but they dont address my problem. How do you translate a phrase that is dynamically generated I could easily read the English text and translate Sent, Letter, to and Customer, but I guarantee that it will look stupid to the end user because its a phrase. The dynamic part of the systemgenerated note would screw up any lookups that we perform on the phrase if we stored the phrase in English, less the dynamic text.p  pOne thought I had... We dont have a table of system generated note types. I suppose we could create one that had placeholders for dynamic data and the translation engine would ignore the placeholder markers. The problem with this approach is that our SQL server database is a replication of an old pick database and we dont really know all the types of system generated phrases They are deep in the pic code base, in subroutines, control files, etc.. Things like notes, ticklers, and payment rejection reasons are all stored differently. Trying to normalize this data has proven difficult. It would be a huge effort to go back and identify and change every pick program that generated a message.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions359870localizingsystemgeneratedstatusmessagesThis questiona is very close but Im not dealing with just systemgenerated status messages but rather an infinite number of phrases and types of phrases with no central generation mechanism. p  pAny ideasp

Negative 1169 pI am trying to come out with a good design for the storage of a data model. The language is python, but I guess this is fairly agnostic.p  pAt the moment I envision three possible strategiesp  h2Object databaseh2  pThe datamodel is a network of objects. When I create them, I specify them as descendant from a persistence object. Examplep  precodeclass TyresPersistentObject     def initself,brand         self.brand  brand  class CarPersistentObject     def initself,model         self.model  model         self.tyres  None     def addTyresself,tyres         self.tyres  tyres     def modelself         return model codepre  pThe client code is not aware of the persistence, it manipulates the object as it was in memory, and the persistence object takes care of everything without the client code knowing. Retrieval can be done via a keyed lookup of a database object. This is the approach that Zope Object Database among many others use. Advantages are lazy retrieval and changes are operated only in the objects that are changed, without retrieving the ones that are untouched.p  h2Shelving objectsh2  pThe data model given above is represented in memory, but a database is then used to push or pull data as monolitic entities. for examplep  precode car  CarBMW  tyres  TyresBridgestone  car.setTyrestyres  db.storecar codepre  pThis is what a picklebased solution does. It is, in some sense, similar to the previous solution, with the only difference that you store the object as a single bundle and retrieve it again as a single bundle.p  h2The Facadeh2  pA single database class with convenience methods. Client code never handles objects, only ids. Examplep  precodeclass Database      def initself           setup connection       def createCarself, model           creates the car, returns a numeric key carid       def createTyresForCarself, carid, brand           creates the tyres for carid, returns a numeric id tyresid       def getCarModelself, carid           returns the car model from the car identifier      def getTyresBrandself, carid, tyreid           returns the tyre brand for tyresid in carid.           if tyresid is not in carid, raises an error.           apparently redundant but its not guaranteed that           tyresid identifies uniquely the tyres in the database. codepre  pThis solution is rather controversial. The database class can have a lot of responsibilities, but I kind have the feeling that this is the philosophy used in SOAP you dont get to manipulate an object directly, you perform inquires for object properties to a remote server. In absence of SQL, this would likely to be the interface to a relational database codedb.createTablecode, codedb.insertcode, codedb.selectcode. SQL simplifies this to obtain a very simple db interface, codedb.querysqlstringcode at the price of a language SQL parsing and execution. You still get to operate on the subparts of the data model you are interested in, without touching the others.p  pI would like to ask your opinion about the three designs, and in particular the third. When is it a good design, if ever p  h2The inverted logich2  pThis is something Ive seen on MediaWiki code. Instead of having something likep  precode db.storeobj codepre  pthey have p  precode obj.storeOndb codepre  pstrongEditstrong  The example datamodel I show is a bit simple. My real aim is to create a graph based datamodel if anyone want to participate to the project I would be honored. What worries me of the third solution strongly encapsulate the written datamodel as opposed to the inmemory one and masks the backend, but it risk to blow up as theres only one central class with all the methods exposed. I must be honest, I dont like the third case, but I thought about it as a possible solution, so I wanted to put it on the dish of the question. There could be good in it.p  pstrongEdit 2strong  added the inverted logic entryp
Negative 1169 pI am working on an enterprise system that will utilise a RESTful web service between mobile clients and a central server. As RESTful as possible, lets say.p  pMy question relates to HATEOAS hypermedia as the engine of application state, and the use of custom xml in HTTP response bodies.p  pThis system will never emeverem be used by public clients, but I like the HATEOAS idea of being able to modify the serverside resource allocation pattern  later without having to reconfigure each of the clients independently. If we decide that due to scaling issues we need to spread the server function over multiple physical boxes, no problem, this will be reflected in the URIs that are generated when a client or the server under instruction from a client creates a new resource. p  pOur business domain is highly specific and unusual. As such, I would like  to use custom XML for HTTP response entity bodies throughout the web service, and the client will parse resource URIs out of the xml in order to stay informed of resource locations that it can use when modifying its own application state. I know that this breaks the H part of HATEAOS.p  pe.g. when a client POSTs a transaction to the server for processing, the server might include the following xml fragment in the 201 HTTP response body as part of a larger xml document. The server would also inform the client of the URI for the newly created transaction resource itself, but this would probably only be included in the Location HTTP header.  p  precodeltresulturigthttpresultserverresults1234.xmlltresulturigt codepre  pIs this emsoem bad  There is very little chance that the clients using this service will ever be browser based. What are the other advantages of hypermedia over delivering the uris as plain text within xml p  pI guess I could go to XHTML, but the parser on our mobile platform is much more efficient with POX.p
Negative 1169 pI am attempting to use MVP in WinForms and am confused on how to best handle coordination among child views.p  pFor example, I have a parent view that has two child views. Events on one child view need to cause an action to be taken by the second child view. p  pShould the parent view control this directly It seems like I am bypassing the MVP pattern by doing this.p  pOr should the child views take each other as constructor parameters In that case, when an event was fired by the first child view, the 2nd child view would receive the event and then notify its presenter that something has occurred The presenter then needs to get the data from the first child view which it doesnt even know about in order to tell the 2nd child view what to do. It seems convoluted so I feel like I am missing something.p  pHere is some pseudocode for the situationp  precodepublic class ParentView  UserControl, IParentView      private ChildViewOne childViewOne     private ChildViewTwo childViewTwo     private ParentViewPresenter presenter      private RegisterEvents              childViewOne.EventOccured  new EventHandlerHandleEvent           private void HandleEvent              childViewTwo.DoSomething       codepre
Negative 1169 pAm I using SessionEnd incorrectlyp  pIn my application, I have a cache to speed up page loads, it works quite well. Recently, someone suggested to me that I was leaking memory by never emptying it out, and to implement a method on SessionEnd that will clear out any cache entries associated with that session id.p  pOccasionally though I started seeing anomalous behaviour. When loading a page, very rarely I would see an empty page, showing an exception due the the cache for that page being empty. I put a debugger breakpoint in the cache access and the sessionend methods, hoping to catch it the next time it ocurred.p  pThe next time it happened I was quite surprised at what was actually happening. My browser was left open but idle for a long time, so Im guessing it had a stale session cookie. It hits the server for the page, which puts a copy of the page into the cache. While the page is still loading, SessionEnd is called instantly, which deletes it out of the cache. If I reload the browser, SessionEnd keeps getting called, agressively trying to close my session that the poor browser keeps requesting.p  pSo I suppose my real questions arep  ul liWhy isnt the browser getting a new session cookie if the old one is that anathemic to IISli liIs SessionEnd simply not designed to be used in this wayli liIs there a better way to do what Im trying to doli ul  pSosh  my global.asax.csp  precode    protected void SessionEndObject sender, EventArgs e      clean up object cache on session expiry string sessionID  this.Session.SessionID  foreach string key in Global.DataGroups.Keys  if key.EndsWithsessionID  Global.DataGroups.Removekey        codepre

Negative 1169 h2Summaryh2  pLong story short, weve been tasked with gutting the authentication and authorization parts of a fairly old and bloated asp.net application that previously had all of these components written from scratch.  Since our application isnt a typical one, and none of us have experience in asp.nets built in membership provider stuff, were not sure if we should roll our own authentication and authorization again or if we should try to work within the asp.net membership provider mindset and develop our own membership provider.p  h2Our Applicationh2  pWe have a fairly old asp.net application that gets installed at customer locations to service clients on a LAN.  Admins create users emusers do not sign upem and depending on the install, we may have the software integrated with LDAP.p  pCurrently, the LDAP integration bulkimports the users to our database and when they login, it authenticates against LDAP so we dont have to manage their passwords.  Nothing amazing there.p  pAdmins can assign users to 1 group and they can change the authorization of that group to manage access to various parts of the software.p  pGroups are maintained by Admins web based UI and as said earlier, granted  denied permissions to certain functionality within the application.p  pAll this was completely written from the ground up without using any of the built in .net authorization or authentication.  We literally have codeIsLoggedIncode methods that check for login and redirect to our login page if they arent.  p  h2Our Rewriteh2  pWeve been tasked to integrate more tightly with LDAP, they want us to tie groups in our application to groups or whatever types of containers that LDAP uses in LDAP so that when a customer opts to use our LDAP integration, they dont have to manage their users in LDAP AND in our application.  p  pThe new way, they will simply create users in LDAP, add them to Groups in LDAP and our application will see that they belong to the appropriate LDAP group and authenticate and authorize them.p  pIn addition, weve been granted the go ahead to completely rip out the User authentication and authorization code and completely redo it.p  h2Our Problemh2  pThe problem is that none of us have any experience with asp.net membership provider functionality.  The little bit of exposure I have to it makes me worry that it was not intended to be used for an application such as ours.  Though, developing our own ASP.NET Membership Provider and Role Manager sounds like it would be a great experience and most likely the appropriate thing to do.p  pBasically, Im looking for advice, should we be using the ASP.NET Membership provider amp Role Management API or should we continue to roll our own  I know this decision will be influenced by our requirements so Im going over them belowp  h2Our Requirementsh2  pJust a quick n dirty listp  ul liMaintain the ability to have a db of users and authenticate them and give admins only, not users the ability to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCreate,read,updateanddeleteCRUDa usersli liAllow the site to integrate with LDAP, when this is chosen, they dont want any users stored in the DB, only the relationship between Groups as they exist in our app  db and the  GroupsContainers as they exist in LDAP.  li li.net 3.5 is being used mix of asp.net webforms and asp.net mvcli liHas to work in ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC shouldnt be a problem Im guessingli listrongThis cant be user centricstrong, administrators need to be the only ones that a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCreate,read,updateanddeleteCRUDa or import via ldap users and groupsli liWe have to be able to Auth via LDAP when its configured to do soli ul  pI always try to monitor my questions closely so feel free to ask for more info.

Negative 1169 hr  pHi, Im receiving 2908 0x80131047 The given assembly name or codebase is invalid error when running my MSI package.p  pThe problem occures when the MSI tries to deploy a component with .NET assembly into a GAC. NOTE only assemblies with dependencies fail. The MSI is created with IS 2010.p  pI am able to deploy the assembly manually with GACUTIL. I verified .NET Framework all versions upto 3,5is installed. I verified assembly properties are identical with MsiAssemblyName table properties.p  pHowever, somehow I had made the installation working fine before. But when the product was moved to Visual Studio 2008 and .NET 3.0 I started facing the problem.p  pDo you guys have any thought on this. Any ideas are appreciated. Thanks much p

Negative 1169 pIm researching changing my current strategy for creating marketing websites.  Currently, I build sites entirely from scratch in PHP, using a simple system of includes.

A product launch could involve changing, adding, deleting and moving around of many pages at once.  All these changes need to be made and reviewed on a staging server.  And when everything is ready, it needs to go into production, all at once, at a specific time.p  pMost CMSs solution to workflow is to allow single page review, by an editor, from within the CMS.  And most of the time, they are reviewing a page that is yet to be published, rather than changes to a page that is already there.  On top of that, this review is done on the production site.  This is geared more towards periodic article creation, like blogging.  Marketing sites do have news sections, but this doesnt help in launching the entire Brand New Thing product section.p  pI cant seem to find a CMS solution for my workflowp  ul liCreate content in a development environment.li liDeploy all changes to a staging server for review by all parties involved emwithout having to find a click some preview button within the CMSem.li liDeploy all approved changes at a specified time.li liAllow for tweaks to content through the CMSli ul

I never know the emexactem size of the reply coming back from the server, so my calls to SocketChannel.read always block until a time out at which point I finally see that the content was sitting in the buffer.p  pIm not real clear on the right way to use the blocking method since it always hangs up on a read.p

Negative 1169 pBy modular applications I mean applications in which base functionality and data model can be extended without modifying core application code. p  pIts a popular approach with eg. open source CRMs like SugarCRM or VTiger. p  pThis approach may be followed in asp.net mvc application using Areas or portable areas from MVC contrib which allow adding new controllers and views in separate assemblies, without impacting core dlls.p  pThe problem arises when one wants to extend the base applications data model. Its not possible in any practical sense with entity framework where the model definition is centralized in the Edmx file. This approach doesnt allow adding a new table that would reference some base module table in a new assembly.p  pIve noticed, that the Orchard CMS achieves full modularity by using nHibernate which is telling, given they have Microsoft backing and the project was meant as a technology showcase. Nhibernate allows such modularity thanks to the POCO approach. Each entitytable is defined in a separate file which obviously is the way to go with modular applications.p  pThere is, however, a hope with Entity Framework Code Only approach, which generates Edmx model in runtime using POCO definitions. Has anyone tried this approach to distribute the data models definitions in a separate, pluggable projects p

I would like this to ultimately be used as a combination actsas plugin actsasattachable and actsasattachment.p  pMy current schema uses an Attacher model with two polymorphic belongsto relationships to attempt to accomplish this.p  pThe specific case outlined here involves an Attachable model Good and two Attachment models Image and Movie.p  pHere is what I have so farp  pstrongattacher.rbstrongp  precodeclass Attacher lt ActiveRecordBase     belongsto attachment, polymorphic gt true     belongsto attachable, polymorphic gt true end codepre  pstronggood.rbstrongp  precodeclass Good lt ActiveRecordBase     hasmany attachmentrelations, as gt attachable, classname gt Attacher     hasmany attachedimages, through gt attachmentrelations, source gt attachment, sourcetype  gt Image     hasmany attachedmovies, through gt attachmentrelations, source gt attachment, sourcetype  gt Movie end codepre  pstrongimage.rbstrongp  precodeclass Image lt ActiveRecordBase     hasmany attachablerelations, as gt attachment, classname gt Attacher end codepre  pstrongmovie.rbstrongp  precodeclass Movie lt ActiveRecordBase     hasmany attachablerelations, as gt attachment, classname gt Attacher end codepre  pThis works insofar as I can do the followingp  precodeg  Good.create i  Image.create m  Movie.create  g.attachedimages ltlt i g.attachedimages        [ltImage id 1 ... gt]  g.attachedmovies ltlt m g.attachedmovies        [ltMovie id 1 ... gt]  g.attachmentrelations   [ltAttacher id 1, attachableid 1, attachabletype Good, attachmentid 1, attachmenttype Image ...gt, ltAttacher id 2, attachableid 1, attachabletype Good, attachmentid 1, attachmenttype Movie ...gt] codepre  pstrongThe thrust of my question is can I use associations to construct the following methodreturn so I can still do things like codeg.attachments.where ... codestrongp  precodeg.attachments            [ltImage id 1 ... gt, ltMovie id 1 ... gt] codepre  pI have tried a bunch of things like thisp  pstronggood.rbstrongp  precodeclass Good lt ActiveRecordBase     hasmany attachmentrelations, as gt attachable, classname gt Attacher     hasmany attachments, through gt attachmentrelations end codepre  pBut they tend to throw me thisp  precodeActiveRecordHasManyThroughAssociationPolymorphicError Cannot have a hasmany through association Goodattachments on the polymorphic object Attachmentattachment codepre  pI think I basically need something that could act like codesourcetype gt anycode ...p  pemAlso, this is my first question on StackOverflow, so please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve my question.

Negative 1169 pIve got an asp.net page that has c codebehind that does some stuff in the PageLoad method like query a database and make a few other calls to populate objects with data.

I set up a couple of postbacks so that when a value in a listbox is clicked, a panel control is filled with the rest of the corresponding objects data.

Negative 1169 pIm using the Paypal Express Checkout option in Magento.  Im not using any express checkout buttons, its just because I was having problem with returning from Website Payments Standard.p  pIn Paypals Website Payment Preferences, Ive set the Contact Telephone Number field to off. Ive also made a number of changes on the Magento side to make telephone number optional as per a hrefhttpreinoud.net201103magentoremovingmandatoryvalidationoftelephonefieldthis posta.p  pHowever, the telephone number field still appears during Paypal checkout, and is mandatory. Obviously, this is potentially going to cause customers to abandon the transaction.p  pInitial response from Paypal support is that the telephone number is always mandatory, that the preference setting only controls whether or not the value is returned to the seller  this doesnt sound right to me, since it makes the setting largely useless.p  pGiven that Magento usually requires a phone number, Im wonder if possibly something in the Magento Paypal API  call is overriding the default setting p  pThere must be some way of making the phone number optional p  p[edit]p  pIt would appear after further contact with support, and some more digging, that despite the description of the parameter, Paypal will always insist on a contact number  for nonPaypal accounts i.e. paying directly by credit card. This applies for Website Payments Standard and Express checkout at least, possibly more. The Telephone number off parameter then controls whether the phone number entered is returned to the store.p  pThis strikes me as daft. If Im on a checkout somewhere and asked to enter a phone number,I dont particularly care whether its Paypal or the merchant asking me for it, Im not going to be happy about it and quite possibly abort the transaction, especially if its for a site I havent shopped with before. I dont even see why Paypal need the number  if theres a suggestion of somebody fraudulently using my card Id expect a call from my card company, not Paypal. Id probably hang up if someone claiming to be from Paypal called me.p  pPlus given that is the way it works, they could have made it a lot clearer by pointing out the the Phone number off field only applies some of the timep  prantp

Negative 1169 pI have a situation very much like in Apples mail.app on the iPhone where a user selects an item from a list codeUITableViewcode to be displayed in a detail view. The user might navigate between items in this view and then return back to the list.p  pMail.app modifies the selection on the list and stays in sync with the detail view and when the user returns back to the list, the detail views item is correctly highlighted instead of the initially selected. Mail.app even scrolls to display the righ item respecting the direction of navigation so that going messages upwards the up arrow makes the highlighted list item appear at the top of the screen and vice versa.p  pNow, my question is that what would be the best way to get this kind of behaviour I do know how to keep the list in sync with the detail view. What I quite dont understand is how to tell if the list needs to be scrolled up or down for the new selection and what is the right way to flash the highlighted item. I dont want the list to scroll if not necessary. I can calculate how many items the user has advanced but I have no idea if the new item will be visible on the screen.p  pThe highlight I have currently implemented so that table view selects an item without animation and then deselects the same item with animation in codeviewWillAppearcode.p  pAny pointers on this would be highly appreciated.p

Negative 1169 pI have need of a view model that tracks changes so the user can see things visually change in response to edits and rollback portions. Right now, I turn on change tracking as the last step in the constructor for the view model necessary, because sometimes the view models are constructed from templates or have defaulting logic that triggers codePropertyChangedcode before construction is complete, erroneously leading one to think its changed even before the user has done anything.p  pThis has worked for the most part,p  ul libut with more complicated controls, bindings, and lack of controlling the order for various events in thirdparty productsli liand, a need to turn on change tracking after view model is built from a DTO returned from a service call i.e. the modelmodel,li ul  pis there a better place to turnon change trackingp

Negative 1169 pThis is probably going to be more of a discussion or hypothetical question, but here goes...p  pDoes anyone know of any existing available source that ideally uses jQuery to build up logic blocks that the average Joe could use to create a process. Basically what Im thinking of is that you can put all the building blocks together and then select the action required and the result if the block is true. For examplep  precode[IF] ACTIONA [AND] ACTION2 [THEN] RESULT1  [IF] ACTIONB [OR] ACTIONA [THEN] RESULT2 codepre  pWhere the curly brackets are defined previously in PHP and could possibly be selected from a drop down.

If I had to make this from scratch, Im not sure on the best way to store multiple items then glue them all together to make one conditional statement.p  pIm hoping to get some inspiration here, if not, a lead to somewhere where I do not have to do any reinventing....p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pFor example, maybe one action block is DAY  so the logic blocksselect menus would be likep  precode[IF] DAY [EQUALS] wednesday [THEN] message  it is midweek codepre  por perhapsp  precode[IF] DAY [EQUALS] friday [THEN] message  the weekend is almost here codepre  pAll user entries would be fully checked and be very limited, so no injections could happen....p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pHeres another example I just found, something similar to this a hrefhttpksistem.comjquerysqlbuilderdemo.htm relnofollowhttpksistem.comjquerysqlbuilderdemo.htma but not SQL  but nothing to do with databases, just conditions of set actions that I will define.p  pstrongUpdate 3strongp  pMagento comes with something similar, as per this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7031805jqueryoranywebtoolnestedexpressionbuilderjQuery or any web tool Nested Expression Buildera though this was August last yearp

Negative 1169 pWorking in a business environment, I dont really get to code or use the good old console anymore.

I never have to think this hard on a daytoday basis, but I felt like my programming skills werent getting any better.p  pI have a problem though.

The code goes something like this called from QObject.connect on a buttonp  precodedef processself   self.messagebox.show    for i in range3      rv  externalmodulefunctionwiththreads  blocking function call      label  getattrself, labeld  i  1      label.setTextrv codepre  pWhen I click the button and the function is called, the message box only shows after the loop completes. The labels only update after the loop completes as well. I tried calling label.repaint in the loop, but all that seems to do is make the message box show up earlier but with no text in it.p  pI know Im not violating the GUI operations from outside the main thread rule ...right, so is there a way to force an updatep

Negative 1169 pIm developing for the AVR platform and I have a question.

The temporary solution takes the following formp  ol liClose the designer viewli liReopen the designer viewli ol  pAnd voila, it works. but I have to remember to do that every time that I make a change to the code base  if the designer view is already open.p  pHas anyone got any useful suggestions for what I could do to solve this issue the designer issue, not the boss taking a proactive approach to UI design p

Negative 1169 pI have made a working algorithm but the running time is very horrible. Yes, I know from the start that it will be horrible but not that much. For just 200000 records, the program runs for more than an hour.p  pBasically what I am doing isp  precodefor each searchfield in search fields     for each sample in samples         do a qgram matching     if there are matches then return it     else         split the searchfield into uniwords         for each sample in samples             split sample into uniwords             for each uniword in samples                 if the uniword is a known abbreviation                     then search the dictionary for its full word or other known abbr                 else do a jarowinkler matching             average the distances of all the uniwords             if the average is above threshold then make it as a match and break         end for         if there is a match make a comment that it matched one of the samples partially     end else end for codepre  pYes, this code is very loophappy. I am using bruteforce because the recall is very important. So, Im wondering how can I make it faster since I am not only running it for 200000 data for millions of data and the computers of the client are not highend 1GB2GB of Ram Pentium 4 or DualCore, the computer where I test this program is a Dual Core with 4GB of Ram. I came across TFIDF but I do not know if it will be sufficient. And I wonder how can google make searches real time.p  pThanks in advancep  pEdit This program is a data filterer. From 200,000 dummy data actual data is about 12M, I must filter data that is irrelevant to the samples 500 dummy samples, I still do not know how much the actual amount of samples.p  pWith the given dummy data and samples, the running time is about 1 hour but after tinkering here and there, I have successfully lessen it to 1015 minutes. I have lessen it by grouping the fields and samples that begin with the same character discounting special and nonmeaningful words e.g. the, a, an and matching the fields to the sample with the same first character. I know there is a problem there. What if the field was misspelled at the first character But I think the number of those are negligible. The samples are spelled correctly since it is always maintained.p

Negative 1169 pI have been looking at generation pcapfiles myself, from application logfiles. I figured that Wireshark would be a good tool for analyzing how network traffic has bounced around in the system.p  pHowever, the believed simple task seems hard.

Negative 1169 pI am currently researching if CQRS can be applied when building a particular system and have some questions I cannot easily find answers for.p  pIn CQRS commands are used to respond to user actions. Users select the actions they want via UI and UI layer knows which commands will handle them.p  pHowever sometimes commands are not valid based on the context, such as user role, entity business state public, archived and users relationship with the entity for example, a ticket has reporter and person assigned.p  pCommands can check this as a part of overall validation. Obviously if the command is not valid for particular entity state it should not make any changes, therefore the validation and changes should be wrapped in a transaction if applicable.p  pThis is all good and necessary, but we need to know if the command is valid within UI layer for the context, we dont care about full validation here so the appropriate UI element like button or menu item will simply be omitted if its not applicable. Therefore it seems to me that the read model for detailsupdate views should return list of valid commands. Also if there is a read model that lists entities similar security trimming is needed here too, using the same rules and code.p  pAs a bonus, some entities have state that is dependent on time, therefore it cannot be stored in the model but must be determined at runtime by using current server time.  p  pThe fact that read model cannot store such information is also apparent because it cannot be known without a context.p  pAs I see to handle this in a user friendly and clean manner without violating DRY so as not to duplicate business logic we have to bend CQRS here a bit by appending additional query conditions based on context and business state checking and add list of valid commands within read models, therefore these system aspects become less separated and emthe process of returning read models involves command handlerem.p  pPerhaps I am worrying here too much and security trimming can be allowed to violate CQRS principles by being crosscutting concernp

Negative 1169 pI have a scenario where i need to check some additional columns while doing the authentication. This is because, the application stores some usernames in database and some in LDAP. the authentication precedence is for usernames in database.

To disgusting both group of users, there is an additional column called userDirectory with values LDAP and INTERNAL. we have to keep a copy of LDAP usernames for application specific settings and all. p  pAlso usernameuserDirectory is a uniqueKeyp  pNow my problem is, sometimes there will be multiple users with same username but in different userDirectory. as mentioned above LDAP users will not have a password stored in database and that authentication is a separate code snippet.p  pI am using the below code for DB authentication.

Negative 1169 pIm using the .Net SerialPort class in C to read bytes from a port. On receipt of a DataReceived event I check the serial port to see if bytes are available to be read.

For one of the form, there is a google map in between fields. and If one of the field above the google map is invalid during form submission, The page gets scrolls up but not enough to the invalid field.

It is because of the page layout of the website. the website has similar top header as a hrefhttpwww.influenceapp.com relnofollowhttpwww.influenceapp.coma i.e scroll down and the header stay on top.

Ie it appears that Android unrotates the screen first.p  pUnfortunately this seems to make AudioRecord crash or freeze in some unknown way.p  pThe basic way I have it all operating is that in the onResume a new thread is started and this instantiates an AudioRecord instance, sets it up, starts recording and then sits in a loopp  precodekeepProcessing  true  while keepProcessing       read a block of data and process codepre  pIn the onPause in the UI thread keepProcessing a volatile variable is cleared, and it then waits for the worker thread to stop.p  precodeif thread.isAlive      keepProcessing  false     thread.join   thread  null codepre  pWhen the other thread drops out of the keepProcessing loop it stops recording, releases the AudioRecord resources, drops the AudioRecord instance and terminates.p  pAs a general start  stop mechanism this all works fine. Checking with breakpoints and adb everything seems to happen in the right order. It just doesnt work in this screen rotated scenario. I can only think it is because of the very rapid new Activity onCreate etc after everything stops in the old Activity. Ie there is something in the AudioRecord that is still busy. What happens is everything freezes up when one tries to turn the screen on again.p  pIf I dummy the AudioRecord code so that it doesnt actually start recording, the loop just sits and sleeps, and then doesnt stop recording again, it is all OK. It only goes wrong once the recorder has gone into recording mode.p  pAny advicep

Negative 1169 pHere is my assignmentp  hr  pIn the land of Puzzlevania, Aaron, Bob, and Charlie had an argument over which one of them was the greatest puzzlesolver of all time. To end the argument once and for all, they agreed on a duel to the death. Aaron was a poor shot and only hit his target with a probability of 13. Bob was a bit better and hit his target with a probability of 12. Charlie was an ex pert marksman and never missed. A hit means a kill and the person hit drops out of the duel. To compensate for the inequities in their marksmanship skills, the three decided that they would re in turns, starting with Aaron, followed by Bob, and then by Charlie. The cycle would repeat until there was one man standing. That man would be remembered for all time as the Greatest PuzzleSolver of All Time.p  pAn obvious and reasonable strategy is for each man to shoot at the most accurate shooter still alive, on the grounds that this shooter is the deadliest and has the best chance of hitting back. Write a program to simulate the duel using this strategy. Your program should use random numbers and the probabilities given in the problem to determine whether a shooter hits his target. You will likely want to create multiple subroutines and functions to complete the problem.p  pHint Lets say Aarons chance of hitting a target is 13. You can simulate this probability by generating a random variable R between 1 and 99 inclusive. What is the probability that R is less than 33 Its 13. Do you see where this is leading If R  33, then we can simulate Aaron hitting a target. If R  33, then he misses. You can also generate a random variable between 0 and 1 and check if it is less than 0.33.p  hr  phere is the code i was finally able to work up after rewriting from scratch twicep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltcstdlibgt include ltctimegt using namespace std   int main       int aaron1, bob1,charlie1, a0,b0,c0,counter0     srandtime0     a rand  100     if alt33if aaron kills charlie              charlie0          b rand  100 bob choots at aaron         if blt50  if bob kills aaron                      aaron0             coutltlterror1ltltendl                  else if bgt50                      while bgt50 if bob misses                              a rand  100 aaron shoots at bob                 if alt33 if he kills bob                                      bob0                     coutltlterror2ltltendl                                  else if he misses                                      b rand  100bob shoots at aaron                      if blt50if he kills him                                              aaron0                         coutltlterror3ltltendl                                          else if he misses then the loop continues                                              counter                                                                      else if agt33aaron misses              b rand  100 bob shoots at charlie         if blt50 he kills charlie                      charlie  0             a rand  100 aaron shoots at bob             if alt33aaron kills bob                              bob0                 coutltlterror4ltltendl                          else if not                              b rand  100bob shoots at aaron                 if blt50  if he kills aaron                                      aaron0                     coutltlterror5ltltendl                                  else if bgt50                                      while bgt50if not then begin loop                                              a rand  100 aaron shoots at bob                         if alt33 if he kills him                                                      bob0                             coutltlterror6ltltendl                                                  else                                                      b rand  100   if not bob shoots at aaron                             if blt50 if he kills aaron                                                              aaron0                                 coutltlterror7ltltendl                                                          else                                                              counter if not loop around                                                                                                                             else he misses so charlies kills bob                      bob0             a rand  100 aaron shoots at charlie             if alt33 aaron kills charlie                              charlie0                 coutltlterror8ltltendl                          else  or charlie kills aaron                              aaron0                 coutltlterror9ltltendl                                 if charlie0 ampamp bob0                      coutltltAaron wins.ltltendl                  else if aaron0 ampamp bob0                      coutltltCharlie wins.ltltendl                  else if charlie0 ampamp aaron0                      coutltltBob wins.ltltendl                    return 0  codepre  pI added in the cout line with the error for when i compile the program to see where my errors are. p  pthe program runs hoever if i get the cout lines of error1,2,3 and 6 i do not get a cout with a named winner that should come with it. furthermore with those numbers i seem to sometimes get a double result i.e. a result with that error and another one from a different part of the program leading me to assume there is a problem with my loops. p  pI opted to use a loop instead of a recursive function as it was outside the scope of the assignment.p  pI would appreciate any review of my syntax and form as I am truly stumped. p

Negative 1169 pIm making a small java game which is running on webpages. Now Im trying to get my game to communicate with MySQL db and its now doing it via PHP.p  pSo here is what happensp  ol liThere is basic login system which sets session when logged in PHP.li liWhen the java game is asking data from db it sends POST URLConnection to PHP page.li liPHP page checks that session is set, if so it echos wanted info from db.li liJava game plays with PHP page output.li ol  pWorking and running like a dreamp  pOnly thing Im worried is that I actually have to change and store more data into db via this same cycle. So if you have your session running you can basicly do nice HTML form and set better weapon for your character.p  pI tried to google basic ways to communicate with databases and the basic theory how servers work safely.

Negative 1169 pPlease bear with me if this sounds a bit ridiculous, but Ive only just learned the basics of PHP and jQuery over the last week or two. This might be plainly obvious to anyone with a modicum of experience, so I appreciate any information you can share.p  pIm updating my website to include a custom search function that queries a SQL database through a cURL call. In shortp  ol lipI take user input from an HTML form including a text box, then POST the values to a php file searchfunction.php on my server under my domain.pli lipsearchfunction.php then processes the form data, adds it to a URL query string that includes a private API key in the format of httpapidomain[api key]request.phpquerystring, and sends that off to a 3rdparty server via a curlinit.pli lipThe 3rdparty server then returns a serialized php array based on the URLs query string. The php file then processes the array and echoes some HTML that appears on the same page as the original user form via some jQuery magic that I only barely understand.pli ol  pHere are my questionsp  pQ1 Because Im sending a cURL string to an API which emthenem handles all the SQL stuff, am I at any risk of a SQL injection If so, what is the theory behind eliminating that riskp  pQ2 How can I keep the private API key hidden The browser URL bar will never contain it, but is there a simple way  maybe through the .htaccess file  to keep prying eyes away from the content of the php file that processes the form data and returns the HTMLp  pQ3 Are there any other obvious security loopholes that I should be aware of There emareem ways to write to the database through the API though not without the API key and the appropriate query string syntax, so how can I prevent a malicious user from manipulating the cURL callp  pThanks for your help in advance. Now that Ive stepped into the bewildering world of making my website talk to other servers, Ive found myself completely in over my head, especially when it comes to security.p

Negative 1169 pIn free appengine apps you can see the datastore reads and writes usage quota as a percentage of the free quota, along with the absolute number approximated to the 0.01 million ops.p  pThe percentage values gives a more accurate view of the currents usage at least apparently, the percentage values seem to be accurate to one percentual point. Whereas if you calculate the percentage for the absolute values you would only get accuracy to 20 percentual points.p  pOn billing enabled apps you only get to see the absolute values, which provide only a very coarse approximation of the current usage. Is there any way to get the more accurate percentual view in billed apps p  pI need this for a profiling study of my app where I run it during a ten hour period under different loads and then read the quota usage...p

Negative 1169 pI am developing a Swing application with custom CSS rendering. As part of the system I use JDialogs as well, but I need to access certain components outside of the dialog emergency buttons. For this I chose following method  all dialogs are nonmodal. Those I want to make quasimodal, will be setAlwaysOnTop.  There is always one quasi modal dialog up. In this case I put another dialog up, below this one, fullscreen, semipermanent.   This blur dialog shall cover the whole screen, catch mouse events and forward them to the emergency buttons only. In parallel I opened gaps on it so that the emergency buttons can be seen through the semipermanent surface without any effect.  The blur dialog can never be focused or activated I have a vetoable listener for thisp  pEverything works fine, until someting happens and the blur dialog seems to cover my quasimodal dialog. However, if I move any external application window over it, the quasimodal dialog remains on the top. Instead of a complicated explanation, see picture un following link a hrefhttplost.lost.hujavascreen.png relnofollowhttplost.lost.hujavascreen.pngap  pSo far I tried to debug repaints, events, everything, and could not find anything that would cause this.

Negative 1169 pThere is something that I would very appreciate, it is the ability to name the dimensions in an array in python. For example I have a numpy array with 3 dimensions and I will regularly have to sum it along a specific dimensions. p  pSo I can do with a ndarray codeacodep  precodesuma, axis2 codepre  pif my relevant dimension is the last one, but I want to make it position independent, i.e. a user can provide any array, as long as he specifies this dimension is DI  example, for Dimension of Interest.

Negative 1169 pMy Visiblox charts shrink to fit the available space, and sometimes the axis title gets shrunk so much it gets cut off.  So I figured I would just create a new ControlTemplate for the LinearAxis, using Blends starter code for the template.p  pI added a ViewBox around the AxisLabel textblock, but it wasnt working right.  Theres some interesting stuff you have to do with the Grid row and column, because the code needs to be generic enough to work on horizontal or vertical axes.  After a lot of trial and error, along with some external support, I have a working template that shrinks my Axis Title to fit the available space.  See answer below.p
Negative 1169 pI am modeling a complex purchasing workflow in Rails that converts Requisitions to Orders.

Negative 1169 pI have a main menu that is a UITableViewController.  If the phone is in portrait mode and then I go to another viewController and then I rotate the phone to landscape, and then tap the back button to return to the UITableViewController, then there is about a 2 second lag on an iPhone 5 before returning. The lag is about 4 seconds on an iPhone 4s.p  pUPDATE The profiler shows that the time is being spent in a system function, code[UITableViewCell setFrame]code. The majority of time in that function is in code[UIViewAdditionalLayoutSupport recursiveLayoutEngineDidChange]code.  p  pUPDATE 2 More digging shows me that the culprit is AutoLayout.

Negative 1169 pAfter using MediaElement on our site for nearly a year with no problems, strikeweve suddenly started seeing Chrome fall back to Flash for h.264 encoded .mp4 files that were playing natively for months. We could live with that, but at the same timestrike playback has started displaying captions by default. If we select to show captions, we get two sets of them displaying simultaneously.p  pMy first suspicion is that Google pushed out an update to Chrome thats affecting native h.264.mp4 playback. Im going to start looking into that, but if anyone knows its from a different cause or has suggestions for a solution, Id be very happy to hear them.p  pYou can view the problem in this clip a hrefhttpkcts9.orgpieforteclip3 relnofollowhttpkcts9.orgpieforteclip3ap  pEDIT In digging into the HTML, Im realizing Flash was a red herring. The web developer apparently chose to write embed code into the  element, but MediaElement isnt actually using it. Chrome appears to be opting to display the captions on its own when the file is playing back natively. It is not using the MediaElement CSS to style the captions. p

Negative 1169 pSome background. Until I redo this part of the app, for now, Ive dragged a bunch of images into my project. They are called Landscapexx.jpg and Portraitxx.jpg, where xx is a number from 0 to the total number of pictures minus one for that orientation.p  pAt some point, I replaced the images used in the project. But the original images are still showing up on my device but not in Xcode. Using NSLog to confirm which image is being loaded, I then look up the image with the same name in Xcode. Sometimes its the same image. Sometimes its not.p  pAt first I thought the problem was that when building the app again the data remained. That would be a reasonable explanation. However, when I deleted the app, acknowledging that the data would be deleted, that did not solve the problem. Could this be a cache issue If so, how do I clear the relevant cachep  pOne last thing. The images that appear incorrectly on the iPad have the project name checked in the file inspector.p  pThe way Im loading the images, by the way is using codeNSString newImageName  [NSString stringWithFormatLandscaped.jpg,n]code, for example. So the file simply needs to be in my project space somewhere, I thought. If there are two copies, I have no idea where the second one would be. I dont see them in Xcode.p  pP.S. If I run the app in the simulator, I get the same images as on Xcode. This suggests the errant images are cached somewhere in my iPad. Since deleting the app didnt take care of the problem, is there something else I can tryp  pEDIT I found something that may point to an issue. If I go to the Build Phases screen and open the Copy Bundle Resources item, all the images are listed there. However some of them dont have the ...in projectname after them. These same items have the project checked in the file inspector. Not all the images are this way. What do I need to do to ensure all the files are correctly in the projectp

Also, another reason I think it doesnt fit my needs is that custom URLProtocol needs to be compiled into ffmpeg lib, correct Or is there a way to manually register it during runtimep  pemAVFMT NOFILEembr This seems like something that should actually work best for me. The flag itself says that there is no underlying source file and assumes that I will handle all the reading and provisioning of input data. The trouble is that I havent seen any online code snippets so far but my assumption is as followsp  pI am really hoping to get some suggestions of food for brain from anyone because I am a newbie to ffmpeg and digital media and my second issue expects that I can stream output while ingesting input.p  ol lipAs I mentioned above, I have a handle on the mp4 file bytestream as it would be written to the hard disk. The format is mp4 h.264 and aac. I need to remux it to mpegts prior to streaming it out. This shouldnt be difficult because mp4 and mpegts are simply containers. From what I learned so far, mp4 file looks the followingp  p[header info containing format versions]br mdatbr [stream data, in my case h.264 and aac streams]br [some trailer separator]br [trailer data]  pli ol  pIf that is correct, I should be able to get the handle on h.264 and aac interleaved data by simply starting to read the stream after mdat identifier, correctp  pIf that is true and I decide to go with AVFMTNOFILE approach of managing input data, I can just ingest stream data into AVFormatContext buffer  avreadframe  process it  populate AVFormatContext with more data  avreadframe  and so on until the end of stream.p  pI know, this is a mouthful and a dump of my thoughts but I would appreciate any discussion, pointers, thoughtsp

Negative 1169 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzViHi.png altThe problematic application, simplifiedp  pMy program works perfectly. I assure you with my life, 0 bugs. Proudly, I tried to package the application as an .ipa file for adhoc distribution to my beta tester using TestFlight.p  pThe program didnt work. Animations which are supposed to happen never happened. Network code breaks. The button to fade out the music beautifully didnt do anything at all.p  pIt turns out that the culprit is the new and shiny blocks. When I test my program in the Simulator or on my device, I used the default Debug build configuration. But when I archive it for distribution and I believe later for submission to the App Store, XCode uses another configuration which is Release. Investigating further, the difference is due to the optimization level you can find it on XCodes Build Settings Debug uses None O0 but Release uses Fastest, Smallest Os. Little did I know, that its Fastest, Smallest, and Doesnt Work tm. Yes, blocks behave differently between those 2 configurations.p  pSo, I set out to solve the problem. Ive simplified my soontochangetheworld app into its bare bones, shown in the image Ive attached to this post. The view controller has an instance variable x with initial value 0. If we press b, it will spawn a thread that will continuously check the value of x, changing the bottom label when x becomes 1. We can change the value of x using button a.p  pHere is my naive code Im using ARC btwp  precodeimplementation MBIViewController      int x    voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.     x  0    voidupdateLabel      self.topLabel.text  [NSString stringWithFormatx d, x]    IBActionbuttonAPressedidsender      x  1     [self updateLabel]    IBActionbuttonBPressedidsender      dispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYDEFAULT, 0,          while x  1               keep observing for value change                  dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,              self.bottomLabel.text  b changed me becase x changed                 end codepre  px is an instance variable, so it is reasonable to think that the block will access it using a pointer to self, not on a local copy. And it works on the debug configurationp  pBut it doesnt work on Release build. So perhaps the block is using a local copy after all OK, so lets explicitly use selfp  precodewhile selfgtx  1       keep observing for value change  codepre  pDoesnt work either in Release. OK, so lets access the damn variable directly using pointerp  precodeint pointerToX  ampx dispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYDEFAULT, 0,      while pointerToX  1           keep observing for value change           other codes  codepre  pStill doesnt work. This is when it dawned to me that the smart optimizing compiler assumes that there is no possible way in this multithreaded world that the result of the comparison will change, so perhaps it substituted it to be always TRUE or some other voodoo.p  pNow, when I use this, things start working againp  precodewhile x  1       keep observing for value change     NSLogd, x  codepre  pSo, to bypass the compiler optimizing out the comparison, I resorted to making a getterp  precode intx      return x  codepre  pAnd then checking the value using that getterp  precodewhile self.x  1       keep observing for value change  codepre  pIt now works, because self.x is actually a call to a function and the compiler is polite enough to let the function actually do its job. However, I think this is a rather convoluted way to do something so simple. Is there any other way you would have coded it, another pattern that you will use, if you are faced with the task of observing for change of value inside a block Thanks a lotp

Negative 1169 pFirst, a little background My healthcare office has a network drive on which we store all of our patient records. The default Windows Explorer interface does not provide enough data safety when accessing the network drive. Users are able to accidentally rename things, move things, name things improperly, etc. When this happens, it becomes very difficult to find records.p  pSo, I am trying to fix that by designing an interface that is safer. I decided to use Python and Django because  once the database is set up  its actually much faster, and it would be nice to not have to install an application on every computer in the office  they just visit the internal web page. Ive already designed the back end python code, which keeps the database synced with the network drive. It wasnt easy, but I was able to figure it out. However, now I have to design the front end, which lets the users update the database, and Im emnotem a web programmer, so the thought of learning advanced html, css, jquery, etc just for this one project was daunting. I also really like the way the Django Admin interface looked. Finally, it did mostly what I wanted it to do  provided an easy way to see what was there, and change that if necessary. So, Ive decided to try and tweak the admin templates and such to get them to do what I want. There are a lot of issues Im running into, but Ive decided to make a separate question for each one, and this is the one Im working on right nowp  pEach record is a pdf, and Im looking at the InlineTab template and trying to get it to include a link to that pdf file on the local file system. Ive got it to display a link, but when I click on it, nothing happens. Ideally, when I click on the link, Id like it to show the pdf in a space set aside for that on the page currently the information for each record goes across the whole screen, and I want it to only go partway across and have the rest of the screen show the pdf of the selected record, but for now Id settle for getting the link to open on its own.p  pmy modelsp  precodeclass Patientmodels.Model     Holds all the information needed for a Patient and their records     lastname  models.CharFieldmaxlength  100     firstname  models.CharFieldmaxlength  100     midinit  models.CharFieldmaxlength  1, blank  True     dob  models.CharFieldmaxlength  20, blank  True     path  models.CharFieldmaxlength  500, blank  True  class Recordmodels.Model     Holds all the information needed for a certain record     patient  models.ForeignKeyPatient     title  models.CharFieldmaxlength  500     created  models.CharFieldmaxlength  20, blank  True     path  models.CharFieldmaxlength  200 codepre  pmy admin.pyp  precodefrom django.contrib import admin from records.models import Patient, Record  class RecordInlineadmin.TabularInline     model  Record     extra  0     readonlyfields  [path]  class PatientAdminadmin.ModelAdmin     fieldsets  [         Patient Info,        fields [lastname, firstname, midinit, dob],         Patient Folder,      fields [path], classes [collapse],     ]     inlines  [RecordInline]     listdisplay  lastname, firstname, midinit, dob     searchfields  lastname, firstname, midinit, dob  admin.site.registerPatient, PatientAdmin codepre  pYou can see that the records are listed as a tabular inline, so I tracked down that template tabular.html, and this seems to be the relevant section of that templatep  precode if inlineadminform.original or inlineadminform.showurl ltpgt            if inlineadminform.original   inlineadminform.original  endif             if inlineadminform.showurl lta href url adminviewonsite inlineadminform.originalcontenttypeid inlineadminform.original.pk gt trans View on site ltagt endif              ltpgt endif  codepre  pThis just shows the name of the object, so I changed it to show a link to the actual path of that object thusly the changed bit is in the code if inlineadminform.original code sectionp  precode if inlineadminform.original or inlineadminform.showurl ltpgt            if inlineadminform.original  lta hreffile inlineadminform.original.path gt inlineadminform.original.path ltagt endif             if inlineadminform.showurl lta href url adminviewonsite inlineadminform.originalcontenttypeid inlineadminform.original.pk gt trans View on site ltagt endif              ltpgt endif  codepre  pThat definitely gave me a link to the file, but when I click it, nothing happens, and when I rightclick and open it in a new tab, it just says aboutblank. What am I doing wrongp  h2UPDATEh2  pThanks in part to some research online, and ppetrids answer below, I now know that my strongproblemstrong is that Im trying to access a local file from a web server. Not being a web programmer, I didnt know that this would be a problem. Unfortunately, Im not sure what the solution is.p  pI know that Django has a File object, and it seems like it would make sense to use that. However, disturbingly it looks as though each file added to the database that way will actually upload the file itself to a certain location. The problem is that we have literally thousands of files, exceeding 60GB in size, and basically duplicating that is not going to work. All I want is a pointer of sorts to the file, and the only uploading to happen when a person clicks on the link and sees the pdf in their browser. The files themselves are on the network in a DLink DNS325 NAS device the IP of which I can use in a url within Django. Ive been accessing them through the Windows Map Network Drive, so theyre also available under the Z drive on every workstation. Any way to get Django to just point to these files so I can see them in the browserp  h2UPDATEh2  pIve found that Django itself has a way of serving static files of this type. Naturally, this is not suitable for production, but Ill be using it to just get things working for now. Ive followed the directions on the Django website about serving static files, and ended up with this in my settings.pyp  precodeSTATICROOT  Cprojectsworking  STATICURL  static codepre  pThe appropriate line of the tabular.html template now looks like thisp  precode if inlineadminform.original  lta hrefstatic inlineadminform.original.relativepath  targetblankgt inlineadminform.original.relativepath ltagt endif  codepre  pOn the one hand, this seems to be working, because its now trying to open a proper URL, but whenever it does, it gives me a 404 error, indicating the static file is not actually being served at that location. So, my NEW question is how do I get the static files to actually be served at the correct URLsp  h2YET ANOTHER UPDATEh2  pOk, I think Ive made a breakthrough. It seemed that although Django can serve static files, I wasnt doing strongallstrong the steps necessary to make that happen. Now, my settings.py looks like thisp  precodeSTATICROOT     URL prefix for static files.  Example httpexample.comstatic, httpstatic.example.com STATICURL  static   Additional locations of static files STATICFILESDIRS        Put strings here, like homehtmlstatic or Cwwwdjangostatic.      Always use forward slashes, even on Windows.      Dont forget to use absolute paths, not relative paths.     Cprojectsworking,  codepre  pMy urls.py looks like thisp  precodefrom django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import staticfilesurlpatterns   Uncomment the next two lines to enable the admin from django.contrib import admin admin.autodiscover  urlpatterns  patterns,     urlradmin, includeadmin.site.urls,     urlrsearchresults, views.searchresults,   urlpatterns  staticfilesurlpatterns codepre  pAnd the template for the tabular inline looks like thisp  precode if inlineadminform.original  lta href static inlineadminform.original.relativepath  targetblankgt inlineadminform.original.relativepath ltagt endif  codepre  pNow, this seems to be getting much closer to what I need. I dont get a 404, a no object with that primary key exists, or the silent failure I got when I was pointing directly to a file on my hard drive. It actually opens a new page with the correct URL, Chrome says loading in the lower left like it always does when opening a pdf, but it just sits there forever. It never actually loads. Any other ideasp

Negative 1169 pI am writing a port scanner in PHP that supports small ranges e.g., ports 2125. The ports and IP to be scanned are sent to the server via AJAX, and then PHP attempts to open a socket on each of the ports. If it succeeds, the port is open, if it times out, the port is closed.p  pCurrently, despite sending all of the AJAX requests at the same time for ports 2125, each socket is only opened after the last one closes. So, port 21 is checked, the socket is closed, and then port 22 is checked, and so on. What I want is for all ports to be checked concurrently, so Id be opening several sockets at once.p  pIve triedp  precodefp  fsockopenip,port,errno,errstr,2 socketsetnonblockfp codepre  pBut this doesnt work, as Im setting nonblock AFTER the socket has already been opened and is waiting for a response.

Negative 1169 pI have been having some troubles setting up a personal server for a while. I recently bought a Raspberry Pi to use as a server so I could teach myself networking, server management, etc. I was under the impression that as soon as I set it up, got it connected, and enabled ssh that I could connect to it with userhostname. However, whenever I try to connect to it I get the error p  pcodessh Could not resolve hostname xxxx nodename nor servname provided, or not knowncodep  pThe only way I can connect to it is by replacing the hostname with my local IP, meaning I cannot access it outside of my home network. I have been toying around with it for about a month trying to get it to work.

Negative 1169 pIm writing an Android app that I would like to eventually port to iOS and Windows Mobile though I know absolutely nothing about them right now.  Id like my app to be able to find other phones within a certain radius maybe 2030 feet that also have the game installed so that the users can interact with others in their current physical space.  Is this possible and, if so, howp  pI plan on the app requiring an internet connection so my first thought was to use GPS like described at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8820747iosfindothernearbydevicesgpslocationsiOS Find Other Nearby Devices GPS locationsa, but that would require continually transmitting data to the server to update the users location using both bandwidth and battery not to mention the server resources.  GPS also seems to take a while to get any sort of accurate fix, and even though I wouldnt store historical data I wouldnt expect users to trust me with that sort of private information as well they shouldntp  pI know there are proprietary technologies, such as Sonys NFC, but thats far too narrow a focus to use for an app that Id like to be device and OS agnostic.  What other options are there  Assuming the user is willing to give the app the appropriate permissions, what other methods could allow one device to find another nearby one, within a 1015 meter range, that is practical for a large million userbase  Is HTML5 Geolocation a better path  Or is GPS my only real optionp  pI did find a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4901313useandroidgpstodetectandconnectwithotherphonesUse Android GPS to detect and connect with other phonesa, but was hoping the past few years have opened up further options.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThank you for all the responses so far.  To answer some questions posed in the comments and answers, I thought Id describe how I expect the appsdevices to interact.p  pAll users who install this app will have an agent running in the background to update their current geolocation and to listen for pings.  Any user may open the full program and send a quick request for all other users nearby.  If I go the central server route, then the server responds to that request with a list of nearby usernames.  The user can then pick one of those to initiate a connection, in which case the target device makes a sound to notify of a request to connect.p  pFrom there its easy enough to handle the interaction between two devices.  Finding those nearby users is the sticking point for me.p

For examplep  pthis is my business modelp  precodepublic class MyEntity      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set      public bool hasMiddleName  get set   codepre  pI am adding a new property codeMiddleNamecode and deploy the application. When the application is started again it should check if the model is changed and only then to perform some custom logic  set codehasMiddleNamecode to true for example. I am not very experienced with asp mvc and I am not sure if this can be done automatically.p  pI am using ASP MVC 4 with .Net 4.0 and EntityFramework 4.0I am not using ef migrations. Also, I am using sql project to manipulate the database. As I mentioned, I am not very experienced, so any ideas and explanations will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 1169 pI have an svg path that I want to apply a pattern to. However, the pattern seems to be stretching horizontally and I think that I may be applying it incorrectly. Is there a way to make sure that an svg fill pattern maintains its ratio as if it were a background My code is below and the jsFiddle below that is the similar with a slightly different settings. The pattern I want to apply is 500px by 500px. p  precodeltsvg version1.1  baseProfilefull  xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg  xmlnsxlinkhttpwww.w3.org1999xlink  xmlnsevhttpwww.w3.org2001xmlevents width100 height100 viewBox0 0 100 100 preserveAspectRationonegt lttitlegtText Pattern Fill Examplelttitlegt ltdefsgt     ltpattern idimg1 patternUnitsuserSpaceOnUse width500 height500gt         ltimage xlinkhrefimgtexturesblogContwhitewallhashwhitewallhash.png x0 y0             width500 height500 gt     ltpatterngt ltdefsgt ltpath dM0 0 C 50 100 80 100 100 0 Z fillurlimg1 gt         codepre  pp  pHere is a link to a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netRKLec relnofollowa jsfiddleap  pI am trying to combine a hrefhttpsubtlepatterns.comwhitewall3 relnofollowthis patterna and the curve effect about 13 of the way down a hrefhttptympanus.netDevelopmentSectionSeparators relnofollowthis svg page.ap  pThanksp

Negative 1169 pIve searched high and low and cannot seem to find anyone with the same problem... and forgive me if I say something confusing, Im pretty new to the Java world and never dealt with any of these technologies before. p  pI have a simple JAXRS Web Service that Ive created in NetBeans 8.0, Im presuming its version 1.1 with Servlets 3.0 but I dont know how to check for sure.p  pI have no web.xml file, this is all configured via javax.ws.rs.core.Application which I believe was there by default when I created the project and reading around that seems to be fine with Servlets 3.0.

Negative 1169 pMy scenario deals with Kendo UI, but I think it probably applies to JavaScript generally, hence the JavaScript tag.p  pI have a Kendo scheduler with the edit event option set to functionA.p  pIn functionA, I create a Kendo window basically a modal that asks the user a question in one case the edit event should continue and bubble up as if the modal had never been there, in the other, it should prevent default and return.p  pThe problem is that the modal is nonblocking, so the confirm modal comes up, but the event logic continues and bubbles to the editors builtin edit event.p  pHow can I capture and pause the current event and only continue it if the I get the desired result out of my Kendo windowp  pI know I cant and shouldnt make the Kendo window blocking due to JavaScripts single threaded nature, but is there a way to put this event on hold, and only resume it if I say so.p  pBasically, I want to do something like a event.Hold and if a condition is met, event.Resume, otherwise, do event.preventDefault.p

Negative 1169 pMy group runs an older version of the JBoss Application Server 4.2.3 as our Java application server please, dont ask why.  JBoss contains a native web services stack that we have been using for several years to consume a web service from a vendor.  Unfortunately, the native web services stack does not support many of the newer WS policies contained in the vendors latest WSDL for their newest version of their web service.  I tried upgrading the native web services stack to the latest version for our JBoss servers jbosswsnative.3.1.1, but that had no effect unknown policy exceptions.  Further research indicated that in order to support the WS policies in the new WSDL, a newer web services stack would be needed. I settled on AXIS2 as it has been around for awhile and seems to support the latest WS policies additional research seems to indicate that there may be betternewer alternatives to AXIS2 like Apache CXF, but AXIS2 should work and has decent integration with the Eclipse IDE. BTW... the vendors web service is a WCF and outside of my control  their product is installed within our company company employees have access to servers but not to code.p  pSo I created the stub classes from the new WSDL client generated using AXIS2 Eclipse Code Generator plugin  running Eclipse Juno and wrote an interface method to invoke the getStreamUrl service.  It appears that the AXIS2 client code is working, as it seems it is actually reaching out to the new web service, but it is failing early in the process with the following errorp  pcodeorg.apache.axis2.AxisFault Transport error 404 Error Not Foundcodep  pBased on my research, two things can generate this fault 1. The resource actually does not exist hence the HTTP 404 error, or 2. The web service does not like the chunked TransferEncoding HTTP header.  I set an option to disable TransferEncoding HTTP header in the constructor of the stub class chunked  false but still receive the same error I did this as setting this option to false seemed to work for some users experiencing the same issue  I also read somewhere that Microsoft web services WCF do not like the chunked TransferEncoding HTTP header cant remember where I read this.  p  pBecause the WSDL is over SSL, I installed the security certificates from the server serving the WSDL into my local JBoss application servers keystore and truststore files. I specify this server as the target endpoint passed into the constructor stub class.  I have supplied the client code below note that it is pretty rough  just want to see if I can get something working. Note that the server hosting the web serviceWSDL is in the company network and the WSDL is accessible via a browser.p  pBelow is what is happening before the error note that it is pretty extensive, as I have enabled TRACE level logging on the axis2 classes to try and see what was happening.  The most pertinent parts are below this is essentially from the end of the server.log file.

Something like JQueryUIs a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdownload relnofollowCustom Buildera where I choose the components I want and have to add only a single file, or just a few files to source control would be ideal.  We already use JQueryUI for some items, we may need to use it more if incorporating YUI3 cant be less burdensome on the file system.p

Negative 1169 pI had what I liked to think was the perfect slider written  it dynamically counts the number of elements, their widths, and adjusts itself accordingly.  It works universally, only requiring minimal styling based only on a toplevel wrapper ID and works well for different backnext buttons and different sized sliding elements on different pages.  But when I tried to do two sliders on the same page I ran into problems.  I know its something to do with making my variables local, and I probably need to run an each to cover both sliders on the one page, but Im confusing myself on how to pull all that off.  I think how I broke it down into 3 functions is making this more difficult. p  pMy JS is pasted below.  If you want to see it in action, or inaction, with CSS and HTML see a hrefhttpwww.anomie.infotesttest.html relnofollowhttpwww.anomie.infotesttest.htmla.   [If you want to see how its supposed to work, and does work with just one slider on a page, see a hrefhttpwww.anomie.infotesttest.zip relnofollowhttpwww.anomie.infotesttest.zipa with everything zipped up.  Note how in the OK version in the zip that the back and forward buttons turn on and off appropriately when there are or are not any more slider elements to click through.]p  pMuch thanks for any and all pointers p  precode slider if .sliderinnerwrapper.length      window.loadfunction         slideImageVals  function              wrapperSliderWrapperWidth  .sliderinnerwrapper.width             wrapperSliderInnerWidth  .sliderinnerinner .elementslide.width             wrapperSliderInnerLength  .sliderinnerinner .elementslide.length             wrapperSliderInnerMakeWidth  wrapperSliderWrapperWidth  wrapperSliderInnerLength             .sliderinnerinner.widthwrapperSliderInnerMakeWidth             wrapperSliderInnerSubWidth  wrapperSliderInnerWidth  wrapperSliderInnerMakeWidth                  slideImageVals          slideImageChangeVals  function              wrapperSliderInnerPositionLeft  Math.round.sliderinnerinner.position.left             wrapperSliderInnerSlideRight  wrapperSliderInnerPositionLeft  wrapperSliderInnerWidth             wrapperSliderInnerSlideLeft  wrapperSliderInnerPositionLeft  wrapperSliderInnerWidth              if .sliderinnerinner .elementslide.length lt 1                  .sliderbutton.hide                           if wrapperSliderInnerPositionLeft lt 0                  .sliderbuttonback.addClassactive                          if wrapperSliderInnerPositionLeft  0                  .sliderbuttonback.removeClassactive                          if wrapperSliderInnerMakeWidth gt wrapperSliderInnerWidth                  .sliderbuttonnext.addClassactive                          if wrapperSliderInnerPositionLeft lt wrapperSliderInnerSubWidth                  .sliderbuttonnext.removeClassactive                               slideImageChangeVals          slideImageHoldFlag  function              slideImageChangeVals             wrapperSliderInnerFlagLeft  wrapperSliderInnerPositionLeft  wrapperSliderInnerWidth                  slideImageHoldFlag           .sliderbuttonnext.clickfunction          if this.hasClassactive              .sliderinnerinner.animate left wrapperSliderInnerSlideLeft ,                          duration 1000,                         specialEasing                          left easeOutBack                     ,                         complete function                              slideImageHoldFlag                                                         .sliderbuttonback.clickfunction          if this.hasClassactive              .sliderinnerinner.animate left wrapperSliderInnerSlideRight ,                          duration 1000,                         specialEasing                          left easeOutBack                     ,                         complete function                              slideImageHoldFlag                                                       end slider codepre  hr  pfor some reason, Im not able to get it to work on jsfiddle.  all apologies for those who prefer jsfiddle.p

Negative 1169 pI am working on a problem in my WPF application which uses the ASP.NET Membership amp Role providers for SQL Anywhere.  The app uses codeBackgroundWorkercode objects to perform tasks in the background off of the UI thread.  In a nutshellp  ol liDuring program startup, the application allows the user to log in.li liOnce the user has logged in, it creates an instance of a custom codeUsercode class.  This class implements the codeIPrincipalcode interface.li liOnce the instance of the custom codeUsercode class is created, it is passed to the codeAppDomain.SetThreadPrincipalcode method so that every new codeThreadcode that is created uses it as the default codePrincipalcode.li liThe background tasks use the codeThread.CurrentThread.Principalcode property to determine the name of the user currently logged in and retrieve the users permissions from the codeRolecode provider.li ol  pThis mechanism has worked fine for 3 years, but something changed recently.  We have upgraded a number of thirdparty libraries and now, the codeBackgroundWorkercode threads are using the default codePrincipalcode, which has the empty string as the user name.  This means that no data is retrieved from the database when the roles checks are performed and the background tasks dont work.p  pSo it seems that the threads in the thread pool are being created sooner than they used to be before the recent upgrades.  Id like to find out when theyre being created so I can investigate the possibility of performing the user login process earlier in the startup.p  pJust when does .NET create the thread pool and the threads inside of itp

Not sure what that means, but I dont get any errors or anything so that is all I have to go off of.p  pVery frustrating...especially because it is primarily happening on my clients phone and not mine.p  pThoughtsp  pThanks, Davidp

Negative 1169 pI have a class called Logger, which has an ObservableCollection which holds all of the item data that is bound to a ListView control on my MainWindow class. p  pInside the Logger class I raise the PropertyChangedEventHandler event to tell the UI that the collection has been updated. At this point I would also like to update the UI to scroll the ListView to the bottom. p  pWhere or how would I go about this I was looking for an attribute of the XAML control like OnPropertyChanged and inside it I could do something to scroll to the bottom.p  pI know that from within a class that has an instance of the MainWindow I can simply use the ScrollIntoView method on the LV box, but since I dont have an instance of the Window in the Logger class, how can I achieve this p  pSorry if this is straightforward, Im in the early stages of WPFp  pCheers, Davep

Negative 1169 pI have a custom query which fetches data from joins between a liferay table codeorganizationcode and other two custom entities say codeentityAtableAcode and codeentityBtableBcode. The codeSQL querycode works fine and returns the results as expected. I am confused now how to make it work with the liferay custom query.p  pAs I know, normally in the custom codeFinderImplcode class you need to add the codeImpl.classcode to the query. Something like thisp  precodeSQLQuery q  session.createSQLQuerysql q.addEntityorders, OrdersImpl.class codepre  pAnd also the return type of the codeFinderImplcode will be the same as the entity type which was added to the query before. Something likep  precodereturn ListltOrdersgt QueryUtil.listq, getDialect, begin, end codepre  pSo in my case I have three entities one from liferay and two custom entities. So what I do isp  precodeSQLQuery q  session.createSQLQuerysql q.addEntityentityA, entityAImpl.classcustom entity q.addEntityentityB, entityBImpl.classcustom entity q.addEntityOrganization,PortalClassLoaderUtil.getClassLoader.loadClasscom.liferay.portal.model.impl.OrganizationImplLiferay entity codepre  pand I put the return type as codeObjectcodep  precodereturn ListltObjectgt QueryUtil.listq, getDialect, begin, end codepre  pBut this gives codeOrganizationcode as codeUnknownEntityExceptioncode. If I strongDO NOTstrong add codeOrganizationcode entity to the query above then I lose the columns fetched from the codeorganizationcode table and can only retrieve the results from codetableAcode and codetableBcode on the jsp page. strongI need the columns from organization table as well.strongp  pFurthermore for the time being if I go without the codeorganisationcode table and just add the codetwo custom entitiescode to the queries, the results fetched are the array of objects. So in the jsp page.p  precodeListltObjectgt listXXXLocalServiceUtil.returnFromFinderMethod forObject objectlist   Object[] arrayobjectObject[]object   objectAentityAarrayobject[0]   objectBentityBarrayobject[1]   out.printlnobjectA.getEmployeeName   out.printlnobjectB.getCity  codepre  pThis seems to be a little bit cumbersome as I have to retrieve the individual objects from array of objects then typecast accordingly and then call the methods on those objects.p  pWhat I want is to be able top  ul liFrom codeFinderImplcode, return a list of single type of object which encapsulates all the information codeorganization, tableA, tableBcode fetched by the query. Say codeentityAcode   or codeentityBcode instead of codeObjectcode type.li liThen I can invoke the corresponding methods on this object to get the information fetched from different tableentities in the jsp page.li ul  pI cannot seem to find the proper guide or resources to do the custom query involving codejoins between liferay tables and custom tables.codep

Negative 1169 pI have a very simple requirement  I have a layout comprising of a header and body. It is a sublayout of the page, not for the page itself.p  pThis layout is repeated throughout multiple pages, and it is possible the structure around it will change.

Also, a codeUser2code created a new codeGoodID 3code.p  pIm working in SQL Server 2008 R2, and SQL dont like multiple cascading paths. The cascading path exists because codeCOLUMN5FKcode and codeCOLUMN6FKcode both refer to codeGoodIDcode. Only 1 of the two relationships allow a codeCascadecode while the other is forced to take codeNo actioncode upon codeUpdateDeletecode operations, resulting in non deleteable Goods if both codeFKrelationshipscodes are set. So in this case, I cannot updatedelete codeGoodID 1code and code2code.p  pA workaround would be a trigger. Since I have a few tables that have the same setup, this would require me to createedit triggers for each table that tracks history this same way, and Im afraid of additional overhead as well as managing problems upon database schema changes.p  pSo my question is actually if there are other, maybe smarter designsolutions for this kind of information gathering, or if I should stick with this one due to the limitations of SQL Server.p

Negative 1169 pWe are starting to use Realm.io in an android app project. But something that we dont like with the Realm.io API is the absence of any asynchronous way to query the database. In old projects we used DbQuery and Sqlite, so we are used to make the database queries inside threads or codeAsyncTaskcodes. But is quite disturbing see that in all the examples the queries are made in the codeUiThreadcode. Isnt this a bad thing for the app performance. We tried to make the queries inside threads or AsyncTasks but we get an error when we access our model objects back in the UiThread, saying that we cannot access RealObjects in threads that wasnt the ones where they was queried.

Additional information is available at a hrefhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId160102 relnofollowhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId160102a. If the applications AppData directory does not already exist, the web server account must have read and write access to the applications directory. This is necessary because the web server account will automatically create the AppData directory if it does not already exist. If the applications AppData directory already exists, the web server account only requires read and write access to the applications AppData directory. This is necessary because the web server account will attempt to verify that the Sql Server Express database already exists within the applications AppData directory. Revoking read access on the AppData directory from the web server account will prevent the provider from correctly determining if the Sql Server Express database already exists. This will cause an error when the provider attempts to create a duplicate of an already existing database. Write access is required because the web server accounts credentials are used when creating the new database. Sql Server Express must be installed on the machine.

Negative 1169 pI am trying to design my schema for an ecommerce web store that sells shirts.  I am using a framework that will generate the HTML views based on information retrieved from the database so that, if there are eight shirt colors, eight different pictures will be shown, if one of those colors is out of stock, it will not be show, etcp  pSo, my question is thisp  pThe web store primarily revolves around the shirts.  There is one edition of shirts right now, and eight colors.  I was planning to make just one codeMongoose Schemacode, a codeShirtcode schema, and include all the information in the shirt schema.  However, it seems that if I want to get the total number of colors so that I can display one shirt in each color, I would have to loop through all of the shirts in the codeshirtscode collection, and tally the colors.p  pThis would involved looping through thousands of shirts to figure out if all 8 colors are in stock.  p  pIs there an easier and faster way to do this p

Negative 1169 pI have a rails app configured on my Raspberry Pi 2. Its on my local LAN getting the same ip over and over from the router.

Negative 1169 pIm attempting to make a Meteor app which allows multiple people to edit a body of text concurrently think Google DocsDrive.p  pI figure in order to do this, I need to have a template which just shows the text thats currently in the database, and then whenever the text is modified, it needs to update the text in the database.p  pI was able to reproduce the same problems from my full app in this minimal reproduction below designed to be used by a single user instead of multiple, thus swapped from using a Mongo Collection to a Session.p  precodeltbodygt   gt hello ltbodygt  lttemplate namehellogt   ltpre contentEditabletruegttextltpregt lttemplategt codepre  pThe exact same problem happens if I use a codedivcode instead of a codeprecode.p  precodeif Meteor.isClient    Session.setDefaulttext, Edit me    Template.hello.helpers     text function         return Session.gettext            Template.hello.events     input pre function event        Session.settext, event.target.text          codepre  pTry typing a bit in the application and the bug should pretty quickly be apparent to you with each keystroke it takes all of the existing text and appends it to what youve typed so with each keystroke, it duplicates all the text. Heres the really weird part this behavior doesnt always start immediately... in fact, I havent found any particularly reliable ways of reproducing it. Once it has duplicated the text a single time, itll reliably do it again and again with each keystroke, up until you refresh the page. After you refresh the page, sometimes the bug appears again with your next keystroke, other times it can take 20 keystrokes before it appears.p  pIve tested this on Safari 8 both OS X and iOS, Chrome both OS X and Windows, and Firefox just OS X and the issue appears in every browser.p  pIf you havent been able to reproduce it yet, try highlighting all the text, deleting it, and typing. Also try starting a new line. I find those actions seem to have a higher probability of starting the text duplication, but even those dont consistently start the issue.p  pMy questions arep  ol liWhy is this bug occurringli liHow can I stop it from occurringli ol  pIf youd like to see the problem first hand without having to run a meteor server although I gave you everything you all the code already...

Negative 1169 pI am seeing inconsistent placement of my Popup control when my application is run on different computers. I have the Placement set to AbsolutePoint and experience the popup being aligned to popups top right on 2 computers, but to the popups top left on 1 other computer when running the same application on each computer.p  pI am positioning the popup using the HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset dependency properties, relative to the screens top left coordinate.p  pThe documentation a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb61359628vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb61359628vvs.11029.aspxa shows that the popup alignment point should be to the top left of the popup, with the target area being the whole screen and so target origin in the top left of the screen.p  pThinking that it might be a change in the .Net framework or a difference in display scaling factors unlikely, but still, I gathered the following info, but I cannot see an obvious reason for this behaviourp  pThe computers where the popup alignment point is to the popups top right are 1.Net Framework 4.5.1 and scaling factor of 125 2.Net Framework 4.5.2 and scaling factor of 100p  pThe computer where the popup alignment point is to the popups top left is 1.Net Framework 4.5.2 with an unknown scaling factor I need access to it to check again.p  pAny ideas why the placement is inconsistent It is not to do with the screens boundaries  the popup is not near any edge.p

Negative 1169 pI have been teaching myself swift and have run into a problem I cannot figure out.  I have a view controller that provides a tableview of items listed by events array of custom class objects and filtered by the current date.  The program works as expected until I try to change days controlled by PrevButton and NextButton.  When another tableview is loaded, the program crashes with an array index out of range error.

Negative 1169 pIn my UI5 app, I have a list of items. I create a new item via a popup enter some details and click OK. With my JSON data for the new entity, I then call create on my oData model.

I saw that OpenSSL library perhaps could be used for such signing but i also read that use of OpenSSL library is discouraged since it is not stable.p  pOne suggestion was to implement the padding myself as per RSA specification and then use CommonCrypto SecKeyRawSign function with kSecPaddingNone parameter for signing. But i really dont feel comfortable enough to try this on my own and i figured that there might be an easier solution.p  pstrongIs there a way in ObjectiveC to sign NSData with RSASSAPSS padding scheme using provided RSA private key, SHA1 algorithm for both hash and MGF function and salt as a parameter and to get back NSData signature as a resultstrongp

Negative 1169 h2INTRODUCTIONh2  pI am trying to implement listview control with editable subitems. For inplace editing of itemssubitems I use edit control.p  pI believe that I have managed to properly code placing of the edit control above itemsubitem.p  h2PROBLEMh2  pI do not know on which events I should endcancel subitem editing  hide edit control, set subitem text etc  and how should I do it. p  pemTo clarify, I speak of the moment when user finishescancels in place editing.emp  pemAt this point edit control is no longer needed, so I should hide it  I do not like recreating it every time I believe that creating it once and then showinghiding it when needed is more efficient .emp  pI am targeting the behavior strongPropertiesstrong window has in Visual Studio  see attached image to see exactly the window I refer to . p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuKNhN.png altenter image description here p  pI want to achieve editingcanceling the same way this window does when user presses ESC keyclicks on another windowclicks on scrollbar etc.p  h2MY EFFORTS TO SOLVE THISh2  pUsing Google, I found few examples but they are old and do not address all of the relevant cases, so that is why I ask here for help.p  pHowever, I was able to find out that one of the events I must consider are a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopbb76168228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeENKILLFOCUScodea, case when user presses kbdESCkbdkbdENTERkbd key and the case when user clicks on something other than edit control.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have managed to handle ESC and ENTER keys, as well as the case when user clicks on the another sibling control or switches windows with ALT  TAB. I have updated SSCCE with relevant changesp  h2QUESTIONh2  pIn order to achieve default behavior for a grid  if there is one for Windows apps , which messagesevents must I handlep  pemCan you also point out where should I edit subitem and hide edit control, and where should I just hide edit controlemp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pMy only problem remained is to handle the case when user clicks on the listview scrollbars, or on the background of the main window. I just do not know how to handle this and would appreciate all the help I can get.p  h2RELEVANT INFORMATIONh2  pI use Visual Studio 2013, on Windows 7 x86p  pI am developing in C using raw WinAPIp  h2SSCCEh2  pBelow is the solution I have so far.

Negative 1169 pIm having some problems addressing logical drives. For clarity, my definition of Physical Disk PD is the raw disk regardless of partitioning. Logical Drive LD refers to a volume such as Drive E, Drive F etc. p  pUsing the examples from RRUZ my hero SO member and implementing the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12271269howcanicorrelatelogicaldrivesandphysicaldisksusingthewmianddelphi12271778comment4910816712271778WMI Classa I have created a Freepascal program for reading disks. I address PD by .PhyscialDiskX and that works fine by the examples created by RRUZ a hrefhttpstheroadtodelphi.wordpress.com20101201accesingthewmifrompascalcodedelphioxygenefreepascalLazarus relnofollowherea. I can read all the bytes no problem for PDs.p  pI use the same handle technique for logical volumes, which are E or F etc. I then use IOCTLDISKGETLENGTHINFO to get the length of the PD or LV and then read the byte range until ReadBytes  TotalLength. I read on the MSDN website that it will automatically retrieve the size of whatever device handle it is passed  PD or LD alike. And indeed I have checked the szie values returned by my program againzt WinHex, FTK Imager, HxD and several other low level disk tools. With the exception of 1 byte variances caused by zero or 1 starting positions, they match. p  pHowever, for some reason, my program is failing to acquire the final 32Kb on Windows 7 Pro 64bit, despite running the program as administrator. It reads the whole disk and then on the final buffer read which is done as 64Kb buffers BytesRead returns 1. Using the debugger I worked out the following values  p  precode493,846,527 exact LV size of Drive F 493,813,760 total bytes read at time of failure 32,767 bytes missing codepre  pThe result of the following p  precodeBytesRead     FileReadhDiskHandle, Buffer, DiskSize  TotalBytesRead codepre  pis 1 on the final buffer read. THis the line that tests for the end of the disk by saying if the amount left to read is less than the size of the buffer size, only try to read what is left. So, the value of bytes being asked to be stored by FileRead at the end is 32,767 because DiskSize  TotalBytesRead at that point is 32,767, meaning thats how many bytes are left to read of the disk. strongThe designated size of buffer is 64Kb. My understanding is that you can put less in a buffer than it is capable of holding a hrefhttpwww.freepascal.orgdocshtmlrtlsysutilsfileread.html relnofollowbut not morea FileRead states  emBuffer must be at least Count bytes long. No checking on this is performedemstrong IS that correct If it is not then this may be and probably is the issue. p  pI dont know if its due to IOCTLDISKGETLENGTHINFO, the buffer storage or something else Hoping someone can help I have also posted along with some screenshot at the a hrefhttpforum.lazarus.freepascal.orgindex.phptopic28647.msg179420msg179420 relnofollowLazarus Freepascal forum.a Here is my relevant code sectionsp  pThe handlep  precode Create handle to source disk.

Negative 1169 pI know the best four naive ways of achieving this.p  ol lipstrongCommit countstrong In the code repository count the number of commits done by a user. However this is just what the name says, counting the commits. It cannot separate near empty commits from commits having hours of thinking and sweat.pli lipstrongLine countstrong Counting the number of lines of code produced by a developer. However developers can practice verbose programming, use inefficient algorithms which take lots of code to be made, or just create ugly and large code. So it is hard to use this as a good metric of the work performed.pli lipstrongTime countstrong I could count the time that a developer spent working. But no one can work one hour straight. Moreover, some programmers can preform 2h of work in just 1h, and viceversa. And in the end is not the time that counts but the progress the project made. I dont care if a developer spends 5 years or 5 minutes coding, in the end the project is to be completed in its due date. This leads to our final bulletpli lipstrongFeature countstrong Counting the number of features closed by a developer will keep track of the overall projects progress. However I cannot tell if those features were toyfeatures or they were insanely hard to accomplish. Moreover, I cannot tell one developer from another in order to see who performed most of the work. I could estimate the difficulty of each feature, however most of the times that is unfeasible because i it is frequent that unexpected problems arise during a feature, ii we tend to over simplify things, iii for emsome significantem amount of features the work of estimating their difficulty greatly overlaps with the task of doing it, i.e., we can only know how long it takes to close that feature after closing it.pli ol  pSo, in the end, how can one measure, quantify and compare the work performed by developers in a projectp  pThanksp

Negative 1169 pIm using codefullPage.jscode and trying to achieve some effect when jumping sections. Basically Im trying to have a smooth effect to change the font color of my fixed header menu when jumping from section to section. The desired effect works as followsp  ol liAs soon as you move from a sectionsay section  1 for example, the color starts changingusing a linear transition. This is achieved by using code.removeClasscode has been used on the menu.li liAs the next sectioncall this section 2 is reached, the color change transition has happened when code.addClasscode has been added to my menu.li ol  pNow the effect works perfectly why Im changing from one single color to another. However there is one section where Im using codeKeyframescode on my section to change the color of the menu after some time.

Negative 1169 pWhat Microsoft Edge is doing, at least from what I can see, is that any external javascriptie javascript from any other FQDN that is different from the websites is being sandboxed to an extent.p  pIm not sure how much it is being sandboxed, but Edge will not let you see function code. So if you were to do a someFunction.toString, you will getp  precodefunction someFunction  [native code]  codepre  pwhere as in any other browser you would get p  precodefunction someFunctionargs, args1  the functions code  codepre  pYou can of course run the function but you cant print it out. Where this gets to be a problem is with Prototype. For subclasses, prototype does a toString of a function to see if it has super as its first argument. If it does, then it knows to link that with a parent classs function. If prototype cant see a text version of the function, any subclasses will not work correctly.p  pThere are no security settings in Edge that can be changed.p  pDoes anyone know any workaround or do we just have to wait and see if Microsoft will fix thisp  pUPDATEp  pI just confirmed that the latest a hrefhttpssupport.microsoft.comenuskb3081438 relnofollowWindows 10 Cumulative Updatea has fixed the issue.

Negative 1169 pWhile there used to be very good documentation for using sockets, thanks to Irl Nathons Sails Cast series. Things have changed in v0.11, with the sails team wrapping and burying the socket.io routines.  The sails site is maddeningly concise, saying what to do, but not how or where to do it, or if I need to npm or bower something.  This has been particularly frustrating trying to  use the sails.config.sockets talked about on the sails site.  Which I cannot even find in my v0.11 directories.  p  pFirst, I would like to know how and where to create my own response to a io.socket.get or .post or whatever.  Right now when I do a get with something likep  precodeio.socket.request   method get,   url sites2,   params ,   headers  ,function serverRespondedbody, JWRconsole.logBody , JSON.stringifybody,null, 4 console.log JWR , JWR.body codepre  pI get back     undefined     VM11497 Not implemented in core yet     VM11497  JWR  Not implemented in core yetp  pI can see the sites being called in the sails console, but nothing comes across.p  pI believe it is because I have defined my own routes and have my own find function in my site controller and I manually need to push something into the server side socket.  ButI am confused as to how I am to call a whole page with http and just the tables with socket.io in the same controller routine.  p  pAlso, where do I write my own low level socket.io routines that can be called from a web page  Do I still do it in the app.js file.  Sails Cast showed it being done there, but again things have changed.p

My idea was to run some kind of loop for ddply data.table to create a data frame for each club with their results in it and then loop again to do whatever calculations to get the desired variables streak and last 10 and somehow push those back into the main data frame where I am housing all of the other outputs.p  pI dont want to be told the answer outright since its important I learn this on my own. However, if someone could point me in the right direction that would be great. Thanks so much.p
Negative 1169 pI want to run a version consistency check between the website and database on every page in the software I work on to see whether one or the other is out of sync. background someone could upgrade while a user is using the software, so restricting the check to the sign in page isnt realistic  also why the check is required on any page in the software.p  pI am not in control of the deployment, as the customer hosts the software themselves on their own hardware.p  pThe frontend is a mixture of asp.net pages and MVC4 gradually replacing the aspx pages with MVC , so I cant simply just run the check on codePageLoadcode in our inner and outer basepages and then have something different for our MVC pages  I would rather not duplicate code for each page type.p  pHaving a look around, I have seen filters which exist for MVC which could be an option for those pages.p  pIve been investigating HttpHandlers and in theory could restrict the requests down to page load and not static content.p  pIs there an alternativebetter way to do this server side check which would have the code in just one place and would affect both aspx pages and MVCp
Negative 1169 pA string consisting of digits 09 is given and an integer query is given. We need to make sure that any of the digits in the string 09 is repeated  query times.

Find the minimum cost to make sure that at least one digit exists in the string  query number of times.p  pNote I came across this question in a contest and couldnt think of an algorithm other than the brute force method of checking and computing the cost with every digit in the string and then outputting the least cost.p
