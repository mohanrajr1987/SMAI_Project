After editing I see choose file label.p  pOf course I test it in backend, I havent created the frontend form yet.p

These are all very domain specific issues, but its a concrete example of my issue.p  pThe main issue is that Im going to be returning result sets that are returned in order for all these statistical attributes. p  pHere are some examplesp  ul liMusic Landing page should display the top 5 artists that have been favourited the most.li liMusic Landing page should display top 5 tracks that have been played the most.li ul  pMy first thought has determined I need a computed aggregate column.

Secondly, since DML on CLUSTERED INDEX columns can be costly when they are not sequential on insertion I need to make this a scheduled job.p  pSo, for the artist favourite stats, heres the DDL that I have come up with.

Negative 14642 pI want to do a large update on a table in PostgreSQL, but I dont need the transactional integrity to be maintained across the entire operation, because I know that the column Im changing is not going to be written to or read during the update.  I want to know if there is an easy way emin the psql consoleem to make these types of operations faster. p  pFor example, lets say I have a table called orders with 35 million rows, and I want to do this p  precodeUPDATE orders SET status  null codepre  pTo avoid being diverted to an offtopic discussion, lets assume that all the values of status for the 35 million columns are currently set to the same nonnull value, thus rendering an index useless.p  pThe problem with this statement is that it takes a very long time to go into effect solely because of the locking, and all changed rows are locked until the entire update is complete.    This update might take 5 hours, whereas something like p  precodeUPDATE orders SET status  null WHERE orderid gt 0 and orderid lt 1000000 codepre  pmight take 1 minute.   Over 35 million rows, doing the above and breaking it into chunks of 35 would only take 35 minutes and save me 4 hours and 25 minutes.p  pI could break it down even further with a script using pseudocode herep  precodefor i  0 to 3500    dboperation UPDATE orders SET status  null                  WHERE orderid gt  i1000                AND orderid lt  i11000      codepre  pThis operation might complete in only a few minutes, rather than 35.  p  pSo that comes down to what Im really asking.

Negative 14642 pI am good with ideas, but due to my limited programming experience I sometimes strain to come up with the most effective solution for a given concept. Currently my mind is trying to fathom the most efficient way to reference a database table specific to a data type.p  pstrongConceptstrongp  pI am building an admin interface that allows a site owner to build a content set based on selected content containers. The interface currently holds the various sql data types, such as int, varchar, text, etc. and allows the user to select the data type, label it, and then link them together into a group.p  pThis group is then referenced as an instance of the data set and can be reused. For example, the containers title and body could used to build a simple page and each new instance of this group could be a new page.p  pstrongIssuestrongp  pThe issue I am having is in referencing these containers in the most efficient manner possible. I cant simply have a table with an instance id and a container id, because there is no way to know they type of container. For example, the contentvarchar table has an id field and then a value field in the format of varchar. The contenttext table has an id field and then a value field in the format of text.p  pI thought about making one large table that held each possible type of data, but this would be a gross waste of space. Currently I use a sub query to select the specific value from the relating table once I know the data type, but there has to be a better solution.p  pWhat are your ideas  suggestionsp

Negative 14642 pI just recently read about Mocking objects for unit testing and currently Im having a difficulties implementing this approach in my application. Please let me explain my problem.p  pI have a codeUsercode model class, which is dependent on 2 data sources database and facebook web service. The controller class simply use this codeUsercode model as an interface to access data and it doesnt care about where the data came from.p  pCurrently I never done any unit test to this codeUsercode model because it is dependent on an external web service. But just a while ago, I read about object mocking and now I know that it is a common approach to unit test a class that depends on external resources like in my case.p  pNow I want to create a unit test for the codeUsercode model, but then I encountered a design issue  In order for the codeUsercode model to use a mocked Facebook SDK, I have to inject this mocked Facebook SDK to the User object probably using a setter. Therefore I cant construct the Facebook SDK inside the User object. I have to strongconstruct it outsidestrong the User object, and stronginjectstrong the SDK into the User object.p  pThe real client of my codeUsercode model is the applications controller. Therefore I have to construct the Facebook SDK inside the controller and inject it to the user object. Well, this is a problem because I want my controller to be as clean as possible. I want my controller to be ignorant about the applications data source.p  pIm not good at explaining something systematically, so youll probably sleeping before reading this last paragraph.

There are two kinds of ways to get into the remote NEs, either directly via the ssh gateway strongifstrong the element has a tcpip address many are osi only, or through an ems management system of some type using what is called a northbound interface.  p  pEither way, the procedure is the same. p  ul liUse Jsch to open a port to the NE or ems.    li liSend login command for the NE ex. codeactuserlttidgtltusernamegtUniqueIdltpasswordgtcode li liSend command ex. codertrvalmalllttidgtALLuniqueid,,,,codeli lipRetrieve and process results. The results of the above for example might look something like this...p  pcodeRTRVALMALLfooALLuniqueidcodep  pcodeCMPSW205 020111 183305codep  pcodeM uniqueid COMPLDcodep  pcode010106MJ,BOARDOUTALM,SA,0110,125358,,OPACLRXBOARD EXTRACTED,codep  pcodecodepli ul  pThe codecode is important because it signals the end of the response.p  ul liLastly logout, and close the port.li ul  pWith Spring I have been using the codeThreadPoolTaskExecutorcode quite effectively to do this.p  pUntil this issue came up ...p  pWith one particular ems platform Hitachi I ran across a roadblock with my approach. This ems handles as many as 80 nodes through it.  You connect to the port, then issue a command to login to the ems, then run commands pointing to the various NEs.  Same procedure as before, but here is the problem...p  pAfter you login into the ems, the next command, no matter what it is, strongwill take up to 10 minutes to completestrong. until that happens, all other commands are blocked. After this initial wait all other commands work quickly. There appears to be no way to defeat this behaviour my suspicion is that there is some NE autodiscovery happening during this period.p  pNow the thrust of my question...p  pSo my next approach for this platform would be to connect to the ems, login to it, and keep the connection open, and just pass commands to the various NEs.  That would mean a 10 minute delay after the application web based first loads, but would be fine after this point.p  pThe problem I have is how best to do this.  Having a single text based iostream for passing this stuff through looks like a large bottleneck, plus multiple users will be using the application, how do I handle multiple commands and responses against this single iostream I can open a few iostreams maybe up to 6 on this ems, but that also complicates sorting out what goes where.  p  pAny advice on direction would be appreciated.   p

Negative 14642 pLets say I have two types of documents stored in my CouchDB database. First is with property type set to strongcontactstrong and second to strongphonestrong.

It would be interesting also to try writing a custom deleter for codesharedptrcode to allow for optional deletion of the pointer.p

Negative 14642 pI have a problem running a Java using Metro client against a .NET STS and secured web service. However, when I run my .NET based client, it always works.p  pAs you probably already know, when a JAXWS client is ran, it requests metadata from the service during runtime even though it already has ran wsimport during design time. However, it seems that this runtime metadata request is where my problem is.p  pThe problem that Im facing is that during the runtime requests of metadata, some WSDLs exported by my WCF service caused the Java client to just hang during the mex requests. When it hangs, it doesnt even get to the point of issuing the RST request.p  pFor example, I can get to a spot where I have 9 [OperationContract] attributes and it works. But when I add a 10th service method, it doesnt work. However, if I remove one of the 9, then it works. I know there isnt a problem with a particular method because I can mix and match and the same pattern holds.p  pI cant seem to deduce a pattern or reason for why some WSDLs work and some dont. I strongly doubt there is a limit to the number of service methods. However, could this be a problem with overall complexity with the exported WSDLp  pDoes anyone have any ideas Have anyone run into this issue beforep  pIf more information is needed, I can glady post it. Im just trying to keep the initial post a manageable length. p  pI will also add that Im running the STS and secured web serivce in .NET 4, and they are based on WIF so I dont have to worry about security settings. My .NET client is also .NET 4. On the Java side, Im using Netbeans 6.9.1 with Metro 2.1 running Glassfish 3. Ive verified that I receive the same issue running on Metro 2.0. p

Negative 14642 pA brief background Im working on a webbased drawing application and one of the tools Im implementing is a 1pixel thick pencil. The tool allows the user to draw 1px aliased lines on the canvas.p  pIn order to determine where the user is drawing on the canvas, mouse coordinates are monitored. If mouse1 is held down, the pixel the cursor is over will change. Essentially it works just like the pencil tool in Photoshop.p  pemNOTE Bresenhams algorithm will not work for this situation. My input is submitted in realtime, so Im not drawing a line from P0 to P1 where the distance between P0 and P1 is many pixels. In general, P1 is a neighbor of P0.emp  pThe issue Im having is that my resulting lines do not have a perfectly clean 1px weight. Heres an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHkdIU.jpg altLine comparisonp  pNote that both of the lines are hand drawn, so there is some variance. Whats interesting is that Photoshop is able to make a much cleaner 1px representation of the line that I draw. The reason why my line looks dirtier is because of thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comriDv2.jpg altPhotoshops linep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSfOv8.jpg altMy linep  pWhen drawing with the tool in my application, the red pixels are filled in. In Photoshop, the red pixels are not filled in. This makes sense because in order to move from a given pixel to, say, its southeast neighbor, either the east or south neighbor will likely be passed over. There is an extremely slim chance that the cursor will pass emexactlyem over the corner into the southeast neighbor, avoiding the drawing of the red pixel, but this usually doesnt happen.p  pSo, the question Im left with is how Photoshop is able to skip the red pixels that are showing up in my lines. The only thing I could think of was waiting until two pixels are queued up before drawing either of them so I would know if a cornerneighbor was passed over. In that case I would just not draw the first of the two pixels because it would be equivalent to a red pixel in my diagram. This runs the risk of not drawing an intended pixel if the user draws a pixel, moves the cursor one pixel south, and then one pixel east.

Negative 14642 pIn my codeweb.xmlcode, the default servlet mapping, i.e. codecode, is mapped to Spring dispatcher. In my Spring dispatcher configuration, I have codeDefaultAnnotationHandlerMappingcode, codeControllerClassNameHandlerMappingcode and codeAnnotationMethodHandlerAdaptercode which allows me to map url to controllers either by its class name or its codeRequestmappingcode annotation. However, there are some static resources under the web root which I also want spring dispatcher to serve using default servlet.

Negative 14642 pContinuing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq469165720984my journey into the world of variadic templatesa, I encountered another problem.p  pAssuming the following template classp  precodetemplate lt typename T gt struct foo       default implementation  codepre  pit is possible to partially specialize it for variadic template instantiations like thisp  precodetemplate lt template lt typename ... gt class T, typename ...Args gt struct foolt Tlt Args... gt gt      specialized implementation  codepre  pWith this, codefoolt int gtcode will correspond to the default implementation and codefoolt stdtuplelt int, char gt gtcode to the specialized implementation.p  pHowever, things become more complicated when using several template parameters. For example, if we have the following template classp  precodetemplate lt typename T, typename U gt struct bar  codepre  pand we want to partially specialize it as we did for codefoocode, we cannot dop  precodetemplate lt template lt typename ... gt class T, typename ...TArgs,            template lt typename ... gt class U, typename ...UArgs gt struct barlt Tlt TArgs... gt, Ult UArgs... gt gt   This would correspond to the specialized version with Tstdtuple, TArgsint,char Ustdtuple, UArgsfloat barlt stdtuplelt int, char gt, stdtuplelt float gt gt b codepre  pIndeed, if I am correct, we can only have one template parameter pack and it must be positioned at the end of the parameter list. I understand why this is mandatory in template declarations, but for certain partial template specialization like the example above, this should not be an issue.p  pIs it possible to achieve partial template specialization with multiple template parameter packsp  hr  pstrongEditstrong Now I feel silly...the code I gave above compiles perfectly at least with gcc 4.5. The compile error I had was not because of multiple parameter packs, but because of their use as member functions parameters.

However, when i try to call pthreadcancel and pthreadjoin on each thread the program just hangs. p  pI have also tested this with just one thread and it works perfectly. p  pAccording to documentation, pthreadcondwait is a cancellation point, so calling cancel on those threads should cause them to stop execution and this does work with just 1 thread. However pthreadmutexlock is not a cancelation point. Could something be happening along the lines of when pthreadcancel is called, the canceled thread aquires the mutex before terminating and doesnt unlock it, and then when the next thread gets canceled it cannot aquire the mutex and deadlocks Or is there something else that I am doing wrong.p  pAny advice would be lovely.

One running time would be 2,947,188 milliseconds 49 minutes, while another would be 920,967 milliseconds 15 minutes.

Negative 14642 pI am trying to move a robot using a compass. We use the compass to make the robot move in straight line, it uses 2 wheels and they move a bit different. So we set a value between 0 and 359 as direction, and then check the current direction, calculate the error and fix it. Like error  currentdirection  actual direction.p  pThe problem is that if for example our init direction is 90 degrees and our robot is at 45, the error will be 45 and it will fix it. If it is 0, the error will be 90 and it will fix it. The problem is that if it moves a bit more than 0 and it goes for example to 359, the error will be 269 so instead of moving 90 in one direction it will move 269 in the other.p  pI use the sign of the error to decide which wheel to move to fix the direction. any idea how to fix itp

Negative 14642 pI have a silverlight mvvm application that loads main view with 2 user controls loaded into 2 ContentControls, one with listbox showing items and other with edit button. When i click edit button, 2 new user controls load into the ContentControls, one showing data to edit EditData and other having Save and Cancel button EditAction.

Negative 14642 pI am thinking of developing a game in pure JavaScript and html5, without using any third party plugins. The problem I am facing is that I cannot find a way to separate different modules of the game into separate threads, like the render job, game logic, asset loading and so on. br br Web Workers seem to be able to separate code into different threads, but the problem with them is the limited information I can pass between them. For example, for the render job, I need to pass the whole world, with all the entities, meshes, textures and so on for every update of the game, because worker threads cannot share memory. It can be optimized, like sending the static objects only on initialization meshes, textures and then send only the state of an object on update its world transform but it still isnt desirable. br brp  pIs there a way to send large data between them or have them share some objects Or is there a different method entirely of achieving true multithreading I know there are easier ways of achieving this using plugins gears but I need to use only methods available in open webp
Negative 14642 pI have a SurfaceView which is currently drawing a series of Bitmaps. These bitmaps can easily be manipulated geometrically scalerotatetranslateetc. An example would be a ball which is bouncing, which may just use translaterotate operations. The ball is just a single bitmap. p  pI wish to replace this ball Bitmap with a sequence of Bitmaps, for example if the ball were to explode in a flurry of fireworks, I have the individual frames and I wish to string them together.p  pWithout having to manually cycle through them on each onDraw call in my SurfaceView, how can I go about this I know in normal conditions I can just make an AnimationDrawable using the frames in an XML file, bind it to an ImageView set as background then call it. However, I am using a SurfaceView for displaying all my graphics on screen, not ImageViews. I have read you can overlay other views on top of SurfaceViews, but I am unsure that I could get the exact position required. For example, the ball may explode at X65 Y21 on my SurfaceView, how could I translate this exact coordinate to my ImageViewp  pAny help or tips on alternative methods would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 14642 pIm having trouble defining what my codeOperationContractcode should be when adding  updating an entity. I want to send an entity or list of entities to the codeObjectContextcode via the WCF Service which will instantiate a Business Manager for me to do the actual validation. p  pIf the  entity passes all of the validation rules which could very well require querying the database to determine passfail for more complex business rules, itll be saved to the database, and Ill need to be able to pass back its ID Identity Column primary key and the value of the concurrency token timestamp column, but if it fails, obviously we want to have a message or messages saying what was wrong. In the case of an update, all we would need would be the new value of a concurrency token, but again wed want the validation messages. p  pTo make it trickier, an entity could have multiple childgrandchild entities as well. For instance, a Trip will have Stops, which could potentially have Orders.p  pIm just wondering how people handle this in the real world. The simplest examples just show the WCF services operations likep  precode[OperationContract] bool AddEntityEntity e  [OperationContract] bool UpdateEntityEntity e codepre  pDoes anyone have any great ideas for handling this I guess Im really just looking for practical advice here. p  pShould we be trying to save a collection of objects in one service callp  pShould we be conveying the validation messages through a fault contractp  pAny adviceinput would be helpful, thanksp

Negative 14642 pI have lists of about 20,000 items that I want to insert into a table with about 50,000 rows in it. Most of these items update certain fields in existing rows and a minority will insert entirely new rows.p  pI am accessing the database twice for each item. First is a select query that checks whether the row exists. Next I insert or update a row depending on the result of the select query. I commit each transaction right after the updateinsert. p  pFor the first few thousand entries, I am getting through about 3 or 4 items per second, then it starts to slow down. By the end it takes more than 12 second for each iteration. Why might it be slowing down p  pMy average times are 0.5 seconds for an entire run divided up as .18s per select query and .31s per insertupdate. The last 0.01 is due to a couple of unmeasured processes to do with parsing the data before entering into the database.p  pUpdatep  pIve commented out all the commits as a test and got no change, so thats not it any more thoughts on optimal committing would be welcome, though.p  pAs to table structure  Each row has twenty columns. The first four are TEXT fields all set with the first insert and the 16 are REAL fields, one of which is inputted with the initial insert statement.p  pOver time the outstanding REAL fields will be populated with the process Im trying to optimize here.p  pI dont have an explicit index, though one of the fields is unique key to each row.p  pI should note that as the database has gotten larger both the SELECT and UPDATE queries have taken more and more time, with a particularly remarkable deterioration in performance in the SELECT operation. p  pI initially thought this might be some kind of structural problem with SQLITE whatever that means, but havent been able to find any documentation anywhere that suggests there are natural limits to the program.p  pThe database is about 60ish megs, now.p

The problem at hand that I have been working at for several hours now is an error occurrence during the building of my program. Basically, a makefile is automatically generated for my project when I request a build the problem is that the makefile itself seems to receive an error and to appears in the console as sop  precode Build of configuration Release for project TEST   make all  makefile1 warning NUL character seen rest of line ignored makefile1  missing separator.  Stop.   Build Finished  codepre  pI have searched for a solution to both problems listed, none of which were genuinely existent. Strangely, the first lines is just a row of  comments. Even stranger, the IDE or the error parsers seems confused as to where the error actually is, because the error symbol moves when certain actions are implemented. What really bogles my mind is that this makefile was automatically generated, and I made no changes to the settings related to makefile by default, the GNU makefile is used, but I tried  the Posix makefile with no luck. I even reinstalled eclipse altogether. It is worth noting that in this particular project, I included OpenGL and GLUT libraries for testing purposes however, I attempted building a semiempty project as well and received identical results.p  pIf any further information is necessary, please speak up. I did not include the makefile because trying to edit it would result in an overwrite after another build.p

Negative 14642 pSo I have been using Farseer for a platformer with physics, and I started running into some concerns as shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIedZT.png altFig 1p  pWhen I want my character to jump, I dont only want to apply an impulse to the character body, but more realistically, the character body should be pushing down on objects below it 1 thus propelling itself upwards 2.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAhoCp.png altFig2p  pThe same applies when I want my character to move. When the character moves, it should apply force and push off the objects below it 1, not carry the object with it and thus moving in the opposite direction 2.p  pAlthough I will be using skeletal animations for this game, I would like to keep it to be a boundingbox shape.  This will be a networked game, and the physics will be handled  via the server. I prefer to avoid server stress, so I will keep characters to a bounding box and keep all skeletal animations to the client side.p  pstrongSo here are my questionsstrongp  blockquote   pAm I forced to fake these forcesp      pIs it reasonable to duplicate skeletal animations on the server side,   and just use capsule bodies for the different bones of each character   Will this be too intense p blockquote  pThe game should be able to support 2030 people per room over multiple rooms.

Negative 14642 pMy program has 3 text fields, Title, Website, and PictureURL. When I click the save button I want it to add the 3 entries into a log of some sort LINQ or XML seems like the best choice. Only 1 user will be accessing the program at a time.

However I havent been able to find an equivalent for the latest version of Office.p  pI could use a for each loop to create a new dictionary where the keys in the old dictionary are the items in the new dictionary and vice versa and then use .Item, but I was wondering if there was an inbuilt command that would allow me to avoid this.p

Negative 14642 pI am currently using Enterprise Librarys exception logging functionality in several of my apps.p  pA while back, I installed Enterprise Library onto my machine so that I could launch the configuration utility from my Visual Studio toolbar. Everything was great until my latest project.p  pA few weeks ago I used NuGet to pull down the Enterprise Library libraries I needed into my project. The libraries it pulled were version 5.0.505.0. The Enterprise Library I have installed on my machine is 5.0.414.0. I originally configured everything in the project, and all the references in the config file were set to .414. Naturally, it wouldnt run, so I changed them all to .505 and everything ran. Now the problem is that I need to make some changes, and the editor wont run because of the version conflict.p  pSo, I checked out a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff632023.aspxMSDNa and I tried to download this a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comdownloadendetails.aspxid6836updatea, but the update wont run, stating that an older version of Enterprise Library is installed.p  pIve considered uninstalling and then reinstalling the latest Enterprise Library, which would probably work. However, I wanted to check if anyone knows of a more integrated upgrade approach p  pstrongIs there any way to upgrade Enterprise Library without uninstalling and reinstallingstrongp

Negative 14642 pI am trying to choose the best STL container to hold Thread objects I am writing a thread library.

I need to be able to access a thread by codeidcode, so I naturally thought of a hashmap.

But I would like to know, why HPT can not preempt LPT If you will read the section 3.3 Unbounded Inversion, It says if LPT has acquired the resource, same time if HPT is ready but blocked because of LPT. But if MPT is ready then it preempts the LPT and executes itself. Then LPT has to wait till MPT finishes. Once MPT finishes then LPT resumes. And once LPT finishes then HPT starts. So my question is why cant HPT preempt LPT or MPTp

Negative 14642 pSo, Im writing a basic application, with a html5jquery front end and a ruby backend. Ive never used a ruby backend, and was wondering how Id go about that. I am going to be using MySQL, very much like an ApacheMySQLPHP thing but without PHP. I will need to eventually put the application on some sort of web server. For now I just need something local so I can develop it. So, is there a WAMP for ruby instead of php Ive been reading and Ruby on Rails seems like it may be what Im looking for, but Im really not sure.p  pSo, what kind of platform do I need to learn in order to do this. I want to use ajax if possibleruby backend. How do I go about setting up my environment.p  pSorry if my question is somewhat vague, thank you so much for the help.p

To do so I added a broadcast receiver which starts the service.I am using the same service in the launcher. I am trying to bind to service by adding extra params to Intent. Getting back results from service by broadcast reply.p  pThe problem is when it first binds, the onBind on the service is triggered. Further bindings does not call the onBind on the service. I believe the problem is service starting directly afterboot. When I dont start the service in bootup and let the activity start it with Context.BINDAUTOCREATE it does behave as expected.p  pThe only solution I came up with is changing the onUnbind of the service and issuing onBind in onRebind call of the service. I dont like this solution since it might break in later android versions leading the onBind method being called twice.p  pSo why doesnt subsequent binds are not triggered on the services which start up after boot completed. Any other elegant solutions are welcome. p  pPS I already implemented it in aidl, but I dont like it, since the service will be doing some async stuff to return data back and I have to add aidl files in both apps, will add handlers which leads to bloated code.p  pThanks in advance.

Negative 14642 pI am writing a program that acts like a private web server that can be launched when a resource CD is autorun.  Once this server is started, it binds itself to an ephemeral TCP port and will then launch a browser to display the resource CD content.  My hope was for this web server to automatically shut down once the process that it launched for the web browser was dismissed by the user.  What I found, however, is that if the browser process was already running I tried this on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE, the process that the web server launched served merely to start a new tab in the browser and then shut down.  I managed to find a workaround for IE by invoking the executable with the noframemerging command line option but I have not been as successful for other browsers.  p  pDoes anyone know if Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera have command line options that will disable this framemerging behaviourp

Negative 14642 pI am writing a basic web browser that can only go to a certain website developed and maintained by another company for my work, however in order for the log in and the time spent on the site to be counted two VERY important things for my company you need to log out with a certain button on the site. I looked at the page source and all that button does is call a javascript function named something like doLogoff or something similar which on a normal browser simply closes the window that is created after you log in. In my application everything is done in ONE window, there are no tabs there are no need for them and Im not entirely sure what the call to close the window does to my application, but the site on the WebView simply stays on that page and only goes back to the login page if you click on a link.p  pIs there anyway to detect when a certain JavaScript function is called in a WebView If I can bind that function and make sure the log out is actually being performed, then I can just make the webview go to the login page myself.p

Negative 14642 pIm currently working on a SQL Server relational database which will be accessed through the Entity Framework.

As it has been set up now, both columns allow null values in codeProblemTypecode since it will either contain a codeProblemTypeRoadIDcode or a codeProblemTypeVandalismIDcode. So the question is really if it is possible to denormalize the model by removing the codeProblemTypecode table and relate both codeProblemTypeRoadcode and codeProblemTypeVandalismcode in the codeProblemDesccode tablep  pstrong2.strong Looking at the codeProblemcode table you will find a column named codeHistoryIDscode. This column should contain a commaseparated string with all the codeHistoryIDscode related to a codeProblemcode. A codeHistoryIDcode is essentially a codeProblemDescIDcode since a codeProblemDesccode gets its codeIsHistorycode column set to true whenever it is updated as the codeProblemDesccode is copied whenever changed. My question is what is the best way to add multiple codeProblemDescIDscode to the codeHistoryIDscode column If it was something like 1,5,7 it would be easy to find all the histories for a given codeProblemDesccode.p  pstrong3.strong Any other suggestions for the diagram is also very welcome p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongEDIT Please consider the revised diagramstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comf9mM4.png altenter image description herep  pNow that you have given me some great suggestions for improvement, I have tried to implement most of your suggestions. codeProblemTypecode has been removed and codeProblemHistorycode added.

Negative 14642 pI have a View in the upperright corner or whereever on my screen. I want to animate this View to a certain position. This position is defined by another xmllayout. How can I determine the coordinates of the View within the other layout, so I can animate it to this positionp  pBackground Lets say the View shows a calculator placed in the upperright corner. When the user clicks on this calculatorView, it should be animated to a more present place. After this animation the current fragment gets replaced with the CalculatorFragment which contains exactly the same View and other Views plus the calculatorlogic. The goal is to animate the calculator to the exact position defined by the xmllayout for CalculatorFragment.

Negative 14642 pRecently I was thinking about some issues I had in the past while attempting to design a particular domain model, lets just say Address, that can be editable with a given context but noneditable within another. My current way of thinking is that I would have both a Value Object version of the Address and an Entity for the Address perhaps attached to something like a customer account in order to derive its identity. p  pNow Im realizing that if Im ever creating a new Address, such as when one is entered in by the user, that I most likely also need to be able to continue to edit that Address and perhaps edit any preexisting Addresses as well within that same bounded context. For this reason I could assume that within this context Address should be modeled as Entity and not a Value Object. This leads me to my main question which is that if you should always be using entities when modifying an existing set of data or creating a new data then does it ever make sense to have a Factory for creating any Value Objectp  pThe rule that is beginning to emerge for me as I follow this line of thinking is that value objects should only be created to represent things that are either static to the application or things that have already been persisted into the database but not things that are transient within the current domain context. So the only place I should any type of creation of value objects would be when they are rehydratedmaterialized within or on the behalf of aggregate root repositories for persistent values or within a service in the case of static values. This is beginning to seem pretty clear to me however it concerns me that I havent read anywhere else where somebody is drawing the same conclusions. Either way, Im hoping that somebody can confirm my conclusions or set me straight.p

Negative 14642 pPlaying around with finding stuff on a graphical screen, Im currently at a loss about how to find a given shape within an image. The shape in the image could have a different scale and will be at some unknown x,y offset, of course.p  pAside from pixel artifacts resulting from different scales, there is also a little noise in both images, so I need a somewhat tolerant search.p  pHeres the image I am looking for.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjrIB2.png altFarmerama framep  pIt should show up somewhere in a screen dump of my dual screen buffer, roughly 3300 x 1200 pixels in size. Id of course expect to find it in a browser window, but that information shouldnt be necessary.p  pThe object of this exercise so far is to come up with a result that saysp  ul liYes, the wooden frame of that approximate color and that, possibly slightly truncated, shape was found on my screen or not andli lithe games client area the black area inside the frame occupies the rectangle from codex1,y1code to codex2,y2code.li ul  pI would like to be robust against scaling and the noise thats likely to be introduced by dithering. On the other hand, I can rule out some of the usual CV challenges, such as rotation or nonrigidity. That frame shape is dead easy for the human brain to discern, how hard can it be for a dedicated piece of software This is an Adobe Flash application, and until recently I had thought that perceiving the images from a game GUI should be easy as pie.p  pIm looking for an algorithm that is able to find the x,y translation at which the greatest possible overlap between the needle and haystack occur, and if possible without having to be iterated through a series of possible scale factors. Ideally, the algorithm could abstract out the shapeness of the images in a way thats independent of scale.p  pIve read some interesting things about Fourier Transforms to accomplish something similar Given a target image at the same scale, FFT and some matrix math yielded up the points in the bigger image that corresponded to the search pattern. But I dont have the theoretical background to put this into practice, nor do I know if this approach will gracefully handle the scale problem. Help would be appreciatedp  pTechnology Im programming in ClojureJava but could adapt algorithms in other languages. I think I should be able to interface with libraries that follow C calling conventions but I would prefer a pure Java solution.p  hr  pYou may be able to understand why Ive shied away from presenting the actual image. Its just a silly game, but the task of screenreading it is proving much more challenging than I had thought.p  pIm obviously able to do an exhaustive search of my screen buffer for the very pixels excluding the black that make up my image, and that even runs in under a minute. But my ambition was to find that wooden frame using a technique that would match the shape regardless of differences that might arise from scaling and dithering.p  pDithering, in fact, is one of many frustrations Im having with this project. Ive been working on extracting some useful vectors by edge extraction, but edges are woefully elusive because the pixels of any given area have widely inconsistent colors  so its hard to tell real edges from local dithering artifacts. I had no idea that such a simplelooking game would produce graphics that are so hard for software to perceive.p  pShould I start off by locally averaging pixels before I start looking for features Should I reduce color depth by throwing out the least significant bits of the pixel color valuesp  pIm emtryingem for a pure Java solution actually programming in ClojureJava mix so Im not wild about opencv which installs .DLLs or .sos with C code. Please dont worry about my choice of language, the learning experience is much more interesting to me than performance.p

FUFA is an organisation and the players are the ones who got the cup for us. To promote motivation in all activities, not only football, you should remunerate people who have done well. In this case, we have heard about FUFA with their problems. They have not paid water bills and they can take this money to pay the water bills. If we agree that this money is supposed to go to the players and the coaches, then when it goes there they would know the amount and they will sit among themselves and distribute according to what we will have given. iApplausei I thank you.br [73] 515tbr bMR Catalanob Mr Speaker, I want to give information to my dear colleagues.

Negative 14642 pSo Im a bit confused about something. I created a function in C to calculate some values and store them in a matrix file. This matrix file opens in notepad and contains rows and columns of float values. Anyway, I have seen matrices being displayed as some form of grey scale pixellike image and was wondering if I can do that in Matlab I have done research but nowhere seems to actually explain what they are. Im not really a pro in Matlab as I only did it for a few weeks in one semester but good enough to understand it. Well my question is, does anyone follow what I mean by converting a matrix to a grey scale pixellike image and if so, how would one implement that in Matlabp

Part of this refactoring has driven me to try and use the Extension classes within PHP properly, i.e. not just throw the Exception class but more relevant exceptions.p  pI have the following classp  precodeltphp  namespace Framework  class Uri       public static function newfromhttp           uri            if issetSERVER[REQUESTURI]              uri  SERVER[REQUESTURI]          elseif issetSERVER[PATHINFO]              uri  SERVER[PATHINFO]                   return staticnewfromstringuri           public static function newfromstringstring           return new staticexplode, string           protected uri  []      public function constructarray uri           thisgturi  arrayvaluesarrayfilteruri           public function getsegmentoffset, default  null           if isintoffset              throw new InvalidArgumentException                 sprintfs requires argument 1 to be an integer, s given.,                     METHOD,                     gettype                                                 return issetthisgturi[offset  1]              thisgturi[offset  1]              default       codepre  pThats all well and good and as you can see, the getsegment method requires an integer otherwise it throws an InvalidArgumentException. The trouble is, I want to create a few more methods which also require integers as an argument and I do not want to cut and paste that code everywhere. What are the best options of consolidating all of these types of argument check so that I can use them within different classes and methods while keeping the messages consistent with one another.p  pOne of my ideas was to extend the exception classes under the framework namespace and have the constructor take different parameters such asp  precodenamespace Framework  class InvalidArgumentException extends InvalidArgumentException       public function constructmethod, argument, value           parentconstruct             sprintfs requires argument 1 to be an integer, s given.,                 method,                 gettypevalue                             codepre  pWhich would be called likep  precodeif isintarg       throw new FrameworkInvalidArgumentExceptionMETHOD, 1, arg  codepre  pIt could also be improved that the codeFrameworkInvalidArgumentExceptioncode can get the codeMETHODcode value via a back trace.p  pWhat other options do I have and what is the best onep

I have currently implemented it as follows, but am having some issues with synchronizationp  precodeclass MessengerWrapper      def getattributeself,attr          Force use of custom getattr          return self.getattrself,attr       def getattrself,attr           return the messenger if asking for it          if attr  messenger              return object.getattributeself,attr           Return the value of the messenger instance if its there.           elif hasattrself.messenger,attr              return getattrself.messenger,attr           Otherwise return the instances own value          else              if attr in self.dict                  val   object.getattributeself,attr                  keep the messenger synchronized                  setattrself.messenger,attr,val                  return val              else                  raise AttributeError        def setattrself,attr,val          set the messenger if necessary          if attr  messenger              self.dict[attr]  val            otherwise, set the attribute and sync the messenger          else              setattrself.messenger,attr,val              self.dict[attr]  val  class Messenger     def initself         self.param1  1  class SubClassAMessengerWrapper     def initself,messenger         self.messenger  messenger         self.paramA  2  class SubClassBMessengerWrapper     def initself,messenger         self.messenger  messenger         self.paramB  3      def functionself         total  self.param1  self.paramB  self.subA.paramA         self.paramA  total  messenger  Messenger A  SubClassAmessenger B  SubClassBmessenger messenger.subA  A messenger.subB  B  B.function  print messenger.paramA, B.paramA gt 6, 6 as expected print A.messenger.paramA, A.paramA gt 6, 2 I would expect 6, 6 since A.paramA should return A.messenger.paramA codepre  pI am guessing that this discrepancy results from a lack of understanding of when things are stored by reference vs. by value in Python, or maybe some weird loophole in the stronggetattrstrong override. Maybe I could add some sort of synchronization function to ensure that everything stays synced up, but it already feels pretty hackish and I would think that there is a cleaner solution. The end goal is to have a messenger class and subclasses which interact transparently with that messenger to createstore attributes and keep everything synchronized. p  pNote that although this example does not show it, the actual application also requires that the subclasses have access to each others methods as well as the messengers methods. Not sure if this makes any difference or not.p  pAny ideas Am I on the right track or should I do something totally different I looked into  metaclasses and decorators, but couldnt immediately see ifhow they would help me. p
Negative 14642 pIm a French student engineer in signal processing field and I do my internship in a neuroscience laboratory. Ive to process a lot of data from the brain activity with the help of Matlab, so one of my main subject is to optimize the code. But now Im stuck in a situation that I cant resolve and I dont find anything about it on the web. I explain my problem p  pFor example the matrix a p  precodea  [ 1 2 3 4 5  6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15] codepre  pEach row is the datas of a signal so here we have 3 signals, and I want, for each signalrow, cut the vector in blcoks interlinked of the same length.p  pFor instance for the signal 1, codeS1  [1 2 3 4 5]code I want to extract the bloc codeS11  [1 2 3], S12  [2 3 4], and S13  [3 4 5]code and compute every subblock.p  pMy first idea was to use nested loop like that p  precode[nrow ncol]  sizea  for i  1  nrow    for j  4  ncol       subblock  ai, j3j       resulti, j3  computesubblock    end end codepre  pBUT as I said I have to process a lot of datas, so I want to avoid forloop. Im looking for an algorithm wich will be able to remove these forloop but I dont know how to do...p  pI saw the function reshape but this on give me subblock like  codeS11  [1 2 3], S12  [4 5 6]code I cant use it because here in the subblock S12 I have the data from the signal 1 and the signal 2.p  pThen I saw the function blockproc but I didnt really understand how it process and Im not really convaince that this one can help me...p  pSo, I hope you understand my problem and that you could help me or indicate me a way to find a solution.p

Negative 14642 pBecause a special reason we want to append some headers and set the cache to NoCache to all responses of our application.

Negative 14642 pI built an HTML5JS web application that performs fairly complicated mathematical calculations based on userprovided data.  The application works by having several different input fields where users manually type in the information, then submit it for processing.  Much of the information that the users input will not change very often but often enough where hardcoding it would not be economical, and I was interested in seeing if there was a way to allow users to upload XML files with all of the required data custom tailored to each user.  The fields would be filled automatically.  The user would change their particular XML file as needed to reflect new values prior to getting new computations.  Just as an aside, anything serverside is not an option.p  pIs it possible using HTML5JS to upload an XML file, read the file contents, and fill input fields automaticallyp

If I hold the lock till enter finishes I cannot handle other events and it may get timedout.For some events which dont really change the state we need to read the state and based on the state we can process them or ignore them. If I dont release lock they cannot be processed.Also in some other cases if an event comes to shutdownthis event changes the state the state machine while enter is in progress I cannot handle it. I have to shutdown the state machine immediately since it is not appropriate in continuing the enter after shutdown event has come.p  pMy Question  Is it good java programming practice to expose the accquireLock and releaseLock as an API in Context class and use them in each state class.p  pThanks, Arunp

Negative 14642 pI am using a MasterDetail flow in my app. The ItemDetailFragment inflates testgrid.xml. Because I wanted to make the views fit the fragment exactly, I inserted an OnGlobalLayoutListener in onViewCreated to measure my frag and calculate the perfect sizes for the views.  So far so good, BUT the testgrid.xml from R.layout gets inflated with the default view sizes and then abruptly inflates my caculated sizes, which of course is not what I planned to happen.p  pI tried View.Gone in onViewCreated for my rootView and for the Gridlayout as well, but was unable to make it visible gain. All of this trouble just to prevent to create the whole layout programmatically, which consists of 42 cells. It seemed like the better way to go, except that I cannot get passed this problem.

The question is  why it works that wayp

Negative 14642 pCLRS  Chapter 22p  blockquote   pTheorem 22.10p      pIn a depthfirst search of an undirected graph G, every edge of G is   either a tree edge or a back edge.p      pProof Let u,v be an arbitrary edge of G, and suppose without loss of   generality that u.d lt v.d. Then the search must discover and finish v   before it finishes u while u is gray, since v is on us adjacency   list. If the first time that the search explores edge u,v, it is in   the direction from u to v, then v is undiscovered white until that   time, for otherwise the search would have explored this edge already   in the direction from v to u. Thus, u.v becomes a tree edge. If the   search explores u,v first in the direction from v to u, then u,v   is a back edge, since u is still gray at the time the edge is first   explored.p blockquote  pI most certainly understand the proof but not quite convinced with the idea of forward edges.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAhpq9.png altUndirected Graphp  pIn the above image, there is a forward edge from the first vertex to the third vertex first row.

Negative 14642 pIm new to Java so I apologize for what is probably a very naive question.  Im writing an application that will communicate with several other processes.

In particular, if the data hasnt already appeared in the input file then InputStream.read seems to be returning 1 rather than waiting for it.

Ill post code, not sure if that will make any difference, but please, ask me anything that you might be oh I think this might be why, whats your setting for.. etc. They used to hit eachother but now they just pass through as if they had no matter, BUT they collide because it triggers an explosion. it doesnt destroy it,  so no, its not because the game object is destroyed. p  pAIScriptp  precodeusing UnityEngine using System.Collections  public class AIScript  MonoBehaviour  private PlayerScript GO public Transform target public Transform myTransform2 public GameObject Comp public GameObject splosion public int maxDistance public int rotationSpeed public int moveSpeed    Use this for initialization void Start       GO  GameObject.FindPlayer.GetComponentltPlayerScriptgt      target  GO.transform     maxDistance  2   void Awake      myTransform2  transform    Update is called once per frame void Update       if GO.colorRed               Debug.DrawLine target.position, myTransform2.position, Color.red           else               Debug.DrawLine target.position, myTransform2.position, Color.blue           handles rotation of AI     myTransform2.rotation  Quaternion.Slerp myTransform2.rotation, Quaternion.LookRotationtarget.position  myTransform2.position, rotationSpeed  Time.deltaTime      ifVector3.Distancetarget.position, myTransform2.position gt maxDistance ampamp GO.stopAI              Move towards target         myTransform2.position  myTransform2.forward  moveSpeed  Time.deltaTime         void OnTriggerEnterCollider other      if other.transform.tag  Player              Instantiate splosion, transform.position, transform.rotation         codepre  pPlayerScript p  precodepublic class PlayerScript  MonoBehaviour    globals private AIScript GO public string moveL public string moveR public string moveU public string moveD  public float playerSpeed  public bool colorRed public bool stopAI  public GameObject splosion  Use this for initialization void Start       GO  GameObject.FindComputer.GetComponentltAIScriptgt    Update is called once per frame void Update        stopAI  false      ifInput.GetKey moveL              colorRed  true         stopAI  true         GO.Comp.renderer.material.color  Color.green         SetTransformXtransform.position.x  playerSpeed          ifInput.GetKey moveR              colorRed  true         stopAI  true         GO.Comp.renderer.material.color  Color.red         SetTransformXtransform.position.x  playerSpeed           ifInput.GetKey moveU              colorRed  false         stopAI  true         GO.Comp.renderer.material.color  Color.blue         SetTransformYtransform.position.y  playerSpeed          ifInput.GetKey moveD              colorRed  false         stopAI  true         GO.Comp.renderer.material.color  Color.clear         SetTransformYtransform.position.y  playerSpeed           else              rigidbody.angularVelocity  Vector3.zero        void SetTransformXfloat n      transform.position  new Vector3n, transform.position.y, transform.position.z   void SetTransformYfloat n      transform.position  new Vector3transform.position.x, n, transform.position.z  codepre  pp

Negative 14642 pIm new here and I would like to ask two questions. Feel free to close this thread if this has been answered before and please put a link on it so that I can continue there instead. Thanks.p  pNow for my question... Its basically it in the title but if it wasnt clear enough for you guys. Let me expound it more.p  pLets say I inputted the words bHi there, my name is Kikertb Without the qoutes and i would like to save each and every word into a different variable separated by a space.p  pExamplebr Hi  saved in  var1br there,  saved in var2br my  var3br etc.brp  por something like that.p  pAnd I would like to output lets say bthere, Kikert name mybp  pIs it possible And if it is, where do I start to learn the code What logic should i follow for this. Its quite confusing for me. The code is in PHP I dont know if PHP versions can affect or any other HTML versionsp  pThis is the second questionbr The purpose for this question is a translator.Example I will input bprintfblah blah blahb in a text box then it will output bsystem.out.printlnblah blah blahbp  pHow can I just change the printf to system.out.println while the insides and the parenthesis remains untouched This is also coded PHP. Basically if the program detects the word printf then it will change it to system.out.println in the output. Like a string changer or somekind.brp  pEDITbr For clarifications The code is written in PHP and I was assigned to do a C to JAVA converter in PHP.p

Negative 14642 pI want to collect and analyze 404 data to address any real issues, in an ASP.NET MVC site with ELMAH. The chief requirement is to strongstore this information in a more specialized and dense but still queryable format, including the referring siteURL.strongp  pI can currently review 404s in ELMAH. However I do not want ELMAH collecting all my 404s at least not in the default format, because these error logs get large too rapidly. Only about 1 of an ELMAH 404 log is typically relevant data, for example logging irrelevant exception details about mundane vulnerability scans. Then, finding real errors becomes very difficult, or even impossible if I have to truncate my ELMAH table weekly.p  pAlso, even after collecting all that data in ELMAH, it does not offer specialized fields for the critical codetargetcode and codereferercode URL fields to query or aggregate that make managing 404s possible.p  pIf theres a package e.g. via NuGet that is able to store to SQL, includes a presentation layer, can sort by most common errors or errors with actual referring sources, and even permits marking them seenaddressed so they do not show in future reports, that would be an ideal solution. Any solution providing a portion of that would be a great start.p  pstrongIn lieu of a recommendation, I will probably add a custom handler to ELMAH and log to SQL through my own data layer.strongp  pHowever, Id prefer a packaged solution, and it need not leverage ELMAH.

Negative 14642 pSuppose you have a process that writes to a file and takes exactly 1 second theoretical to execute.

Negative 14642 pSo I am on a branch with a bunch of commits. At a certain point in time I decide that the most recent commit is bad and I want to go back to the secondtolast commit.

Negative 14642 pI am trying to generate a successful test in Rspec with FactoryGirl.p  h2strongSpec filestrongh2  precoderequire spechelper  describe ManagerSynchronization do      it contains all parameters do         buildstubbedsynchronization, elapsedtime nil.shouldnot bevalid         buildstubbedsynchronization, updatedrecords nil.shouldnot bevalid     end      it processes asset downloads do          Normally created via delayedjob calling method downloadassetsfor,          we are going to do it right now instead         p  createphotograph         s  buildsynchronization         puts SLEEPING          By this point, the Photograph has been saved and should appear          in the test database. If I write below puts ManagerPhotograph.all.inspect,          it gives me a result set that shows the Photograph was indeed saved          to the database. However s.downloadassetsforp.class, p.id raises an          error Couldnt find ManagerPhotograph at id1.         sleep 10          Expect no errors if the instance should be found         expect  s.downloadassetsforp.class, p.id .tonot raiseerror          Expect this error         expect  s.downloadassetsforp.class, 0 .to raiseerrorRuntimeError, Couldnt find  p.class  at id0     end  end codepre  pAs my comment in the spec file illustrates, I would normally expect no error to be raised by the call to codedownloadassetsforcode on a model which by all accounts should exist. codedownloadassetsforcode uses codeRestClientcode to make an API call to the master server  which in this case is the same application housing the same test database the one I just saved a Photograph to. It sends a response back to the method calling it.  However the created Photograph DOES NOT appear in the database when the server gets the request sent by codeRestClientcode. Ive confirmed this by refreshing the MySQL query in the MySQL Workbench during the sleep 10 period.p  pSo to summarize Rspec is telling me the record is saved when it really isnt. Id have to modify my codedownloadassetsforcode method to check whether or not Im in the test environment and just return a different result instead of using codeRestClientcode  but that feels like a cruddy workaround. The main question is Why does Rspec say the record exists when it really doesntp  pThe most simplest way to test what Im talking about is top  p1 Open up MySQL workbench, then go to the test database  table and then view all rows. A this point there should be no rows as the test database should be empty.p  p2 Make an Rspec test in which you use FactoryGirls codecreatecode call or is that Rspec.p  p3 Right after the call to codecreatecode, codeputscode the record you just created. It should show as being saved.p  p4 Put a sleep call right after that so you can manually click back to the MySQL workbench and reload your query. You should see no records in there. i.e., Rspec said it was created, when it wasnt.p

Negative 14642 pI followed the fingerpaint code and some other code to create an app that allows you to draw onto the screen, with a background image in place to draw over top of.  In addition, Id like to make an eraser tool that erases just the pen, not the background image.  I think I have to use two canvases for this, but couldnt figure out how it would work with Canvas onDraw.p  pHeres my code.  Right now pen drawing works, and eraser drawing erases but it erases the background image.  I only want it to erase the pen.p  pIf you could give me hints on what to do I would really appreciate it.p  pp  precodeMainActivity.java public class MainActivity extends Activity implements

Negative 14642 pI am new to R.  After two days with very little progress, I need help.p  pI have a folder with over 300 CSV files, each containing a data frame with header.  They are named code001.csvcode code002.csvcode and so on.  All the files have the same four columns codeDatecode, codesulfatecode, codenitratecode, and codeIDcode but vary in the number of observation.p  pI want to create a function that will allow the user to select one, all or a range of those files and to merge them into one data frame, keeping ALL the data of the merged files no need to compare them and find duplicates, etc.  When I say merge, I mean that the new merged data frame would still have those four columns with the observations from both files.p  pHere is what I have done so far, where codedirectorycode is the location of the files and codeidcode specifies the files to load example code1code would load file code001.csvcode, code274code loads file code274.csvcode  and code20100code loads files code020.csvcode through code100.csvcode.p  precodegetfile3 lt functiondirectory  getwd, id       add 0s to ID     filenames lt sprintf03d.csv, id       find requested files     filedir lt file.pathdirectory, filenames       determine number of files requested     numOfFiles lt lengthfilenames      create empty data frame to store merged files     dataset lt data.frame      ifnumOfFiles lt 2      if only one file is requested...         dataset lt read.csvfiledir, header  TRUE     use read.csv      else      else loop over each file requested and merge into dataset         fori in filenames              dataset lt mergedataset, filenames[i], allTRUE                   dataset  codepre  pI works only when loading one file, whichever one.  If I want to load a range, I get an empty data frame.  For example, if I runp  precodenewDF lt getfile3specdata, 110  codepre  pWhere codespecdatacode is the name of the folder where the files are located and code110code means I want to load the first 10 files, I get a new data frame codenewDFcode with 0 observations and 3 variables codeV1code, codeV2code, codey[FALSE,]code and coderow.namescode.br There should be 7,304 observation with the 4 variables from the original files.p  pThe problem is in my codeforcode loop.  Any help will be GREATLY appreciated.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 14642 pAs we all know, the flat GUI look is now becoming a thing, windows 8 has it, the now OSX and even Android are touching on it with the latest KitKat update for the call application. As Java is multiplatform there is no real look for certain OS. I absolutely love the flat look and would like to be able to use it in Java. I run a win 8 machine and love the look, but all of my Java applications that I create look odd as they dont look native to the OS. Is there any look and feels that are like windows 8p

Negative 14642 pIm trying to do something like timeago which automatically updates itself in a view even though there isnt a bound value thats actually changing. To do this, Ive got the following appwide clock ticker thing which I inject into my controllers, like sop  precode Setup an appwide clock that can be depended on for updates every second or minute App.Clock  Ember.Object.extend     second null,     minute null,      init function           this.tick  run once initially         this.scheduler     ,      scheduler function           Ember.run.laterthis, function               this.tick             this.scheduler         , 1000     ,      tick function           var now  new Date          this.setProperties             second now.getSeconds,             minute now.getMinutes,                  Initialize it and inject it into our controllers App.registerclockmain, App.Clock,  singleton true  App.injectcontroller, clock, clockmain codepre  pOK. Now I use that in a Handlebars helper. This is the bit I think Im screwing up herep  precodeEmber.Handlebars.registerBoundHelperformatdate, function value      return Testing   this.getclock.second , clock.second codepre  pAnd then I add it to the view, with something like codeformatdate foocode. It displays the initial number of seconds, from the clock just fine, but doesnt update. Id obviously like the clock to be bound in some way to the helper so that it updates automatically ever second, in this case. What am I missingp  pEDIT Most of the solutions for this suggest using a view. Id like to do this without using a view. Ideally, Id like to be able to use the helper like thisp  precodeEmber.Handlebars.registerBoundHelperformatdate, function value      return Testing   this.getclock.second .propertyclock.second codepre
Negative 14642 pWere currently working on a rewrite of the Directory of our Peer to Peer Service Bus a hrefhttpsgithub.comAbcArbitrageZebus relnofollowZebusa.p  pWe had a CassandraThrift implementation and it had to be improved to meet some new load requirements, so rewriting it using CQL seemed to be the right thing to do.p  pWe have two CFs, one to store Peers and one to store Subscriptions, the latter being the trickiest.p  pWe need to store a list of routing keys bindings for each message type, and a list of message types for each peer. We also need to be able to update each message types routings list separately we use Cassandras timestamps to handle potential race conditions since we have multiple Directories. And finally, we need to be able to list all those subscriptions when someone requests the Peers state.p  pThe last point was a problem, because it means running a codeSELECT  FROM Subscriptionscode, which means listing rows from multiple nodes BTW how does CQL allows you to list underlying Cassandra rows and happens to be pretty slow.p  pSo we ended up having the following schema for our CF to store everything consecutively on disk on the same Cassandra row and have great read performance we are aware of the fact that this is pretty bad at balancing the data between nodes.p  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS DynamicSubscriptions      UselessKey boolean,     PeerId text,     MessageTypeId text,        SubscriptionBindings blob,     PRIMARY KEYUselessKey, PeerId, MessageTypeId  codepre  pThis is pretty ugly but does the trick, everyone ends up on the same Thrift row, resulting in lightning fast reads.p  pSo my question is the following Is there a strongprettystrong way to design a CF using CQL if I want my data to be queryable really fast during an unconstrained SELECTp  pOr if you think that our design is completely flawed, feel free to say so.p

Negative 14642 pBasically I understand the ambiguity with using other containers as keys.  do you compare the reference or do you compare the values in it and how deep.p  pWell cant you just specialize a list and make a custom comparisonhash operator As I know in my application I wish to compare the listofstrings by the value of the strings and relative ordering of course.p  pSo how would I go about writing a custom hash for these kind of lists Or in another way  how would I stringify the list without leading to the ambiguity that you get from introducing delimiters that delimiter might be part of the stringp  pRegarding this question a hrefhttpswiki.python.orgmoinDictionaryKeys relnofollowhttpswiki.python.orgmoinDictionaryKeysabr There it is said directly that lists cant be usedp  blockquote   blockquote     pThat said, the simple answer to why lists cannot be used as dictionary keys is that lists do not provide a valid stronghashstrong method.

Negative 14642 pWhat Im trying to do is to use the codesynchronizedcode directive to protect a singleton object from being accessed by multiple threads at once. I also want to persistently store that singleton object by writing it to disk after each time its modified, because it is very important that I try as hard as possible not to lose any changes to the object.p  pNow I know a lot of you might say dont do that it takes too long its not a good practice, etc., etc. Yes, I am aware of that. This is more of a what will happen question.p  pSo whenever I go to modify the singleton object, I put the modification code inside a codesynchronizedcode block and then write the object to disk.  A thought I had was to use codedispatchasynccode to do the writing of the object on a separate thread like sop  precodesingleton object id dataStructure  synchronizedlockObject              code that modifies singleton object         not important          sharedFileQueue is a SERIAL queue         dispatchasync[self sharedFileQueue], void             NSError  err              NSData  plist  [NSPropertyListSerialization dataWithPropertyListdataStructure                                                       formatNSPropertyListBinaryFormatv10                                                       options0 erroramperr]              url to somewhere             NSURL  url             BOOL success  [plist writeToURLurl atomicallyYES]                codepre  pSo my understanding of codesynchronizedcode is that only one thread can execute that block of code at a time. My understanding of codedispatchasynccode is a little fuzzy, but I think that this will submit the block to the dispatch queue to be executed asynchronously and return immediately. This means that if another thread comes through my codesynchronizedcode block while codedataStructurecode is still being written to disk, it will just submit another block to run and write the newly modified codedataStructurecode to disk, but that wont start until the first codedataStructurecode is written to disk.p  pAm I thinking about this correctly  Also will setting atomically change to codeYEScode or codeNOcode or will the serialization of my dispatch queue ensure that multiple threads wont be written to this file at the same timep  pThank youp

Negative 14642 pI might be approaching this issue the wrong way, but I am in need of knowing either the current URL of the current ASP.NET page or the form name. p  pI have a C application with a WebBrowser which runs the ASP.NET application. Whenever I check the current URL in the WebBrowser component it always says its the Default.aspx page. Which is fine when youre running it in another browser, but I am in need of knowing the exact URL or the form. p  pIve also tried creating a javascript function to return the current URL, but since this function is only added to the default.aspx page so all the pages can access this function I only get returned the default.aspx URL.p  pAny ideasp  pThanksp  pEdit I forgot to mention that I use WCF events binded through net.tcp. When the ASP.NET application receives such an event, it should handle differently based on the current page its on. I am not able to use Request or HTTPContext.Current, since there are NULL is my case.p

Negative 14642 pMy question is very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6781545whyisfailbitwheneofonreadisthereawayouta previous onea.  I want to open and read a file.  I want exceptions thrown if the file cant be opened, but I dont want exceptions thrown on EOF.  fstreams seem to give you independent control over whether exceptions are thrown on EOF, on failures, and on other bad things, but it appears that EOF tends to also get mapped to the bad andor fail exceptions.p  pHeres a strippeddown example of what I was trying to do. The function f is supposed to return true if a file contains a certain word, false if it doesnt, and throw an exception if say the file doesnt exist.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltfstreamgt include ltstringgt  using namespace std  bool fconst char file      ifstream ifs     string word      ifs.exceptionsifstreamfailbit  ifstreambadbit     ifs.openfile      whileifs gtgt word          ifword  foo return true          return false   int mainint argc, char argv      try          bool r  fargv[1]         cout ltlt f returned  ltlt r ltlt endl      catch...          cerr ltlt exception ltlt endl       codepre  pBut it doesnt work, because basic fstream reading using operator is evidently one of the operations for which EOF sets the bad or the fail bit.  If the file exists and does not contain foo the function does not return false as desired, but rather throws an exception.p

Negative 14642 pIm trying to insert a new record using UpdatableRecords in jOOQ 3.4.2.  The pattern is extremely concise and pleasant to use, except that the codeINSERTcode reads null values as no value and ignores default values or a generated index.  How can I use the UpdatableRecord to do an insert that respects default values and generated indexesp  pHeres my tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE aragornsys.orgperson      orgpersonid SERIAL  NOT NULL,     firstname CHARACTER VARYING128  NOT NULL,     lastname CHARACTER VARYING128  NOT NULL,     createdtime TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT currenttimestamp  NOT NULL,     createdbyuserid INTEGER,     lastmodifiedtime TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,     lastmodifiedbyuserid INTEGER,     orgid INTEGER  NOT NULL,     CONSTRAINT PKorgperson PRIMARY KEY orgpersonid  codepre  pNote my primary key and default values.  Now heres my jOOQ codep  precode orgPerson represents a POJO filled with my values to be inserted and null for everything else  Note that orgPerson.orgPersonId is null OrgPersonRecord orgPersonRecord  create.newRecord ORGPERSON, orgPerson  Integer orgPersonId  create.executeInsert orgPersonRecord  codepre  pBut when I run this, I get the error codenull value in column orgpersonid violates notnull constraintcode.p  pI noticed the jOOQ docs say that calling codenewRecordcode automatically sets all the internal changed flags to true on the UpdatableRecord.  So then I tried thisp  precode orgPerson represents a POJO filled with my values to be inserted and null for everything else  Note that orgPerson.orgPersonId is null OrgPersonRecord orgPersonRecord  create.newRecord ORGPERSON, orgPerson  orgPersonRecord.changed ORGPERSON.ORGPERSONID, false  orgPersonRecord.changed ORGPERSON.CREATEDTIME, false  orgPersonRecord.insert Integer orgPersonId  orgPersonRecord.getOrgPersonId codepre  pBut that gives me the error codeERROR duplicate key value violates unique constraint pkorgpersoncode.  And when I do this repeatedly, the values seem to keep increasing by 1.  This doesnt really make sense to me, but my greater question is strongIs there a good way I can do an INSERT based on my object values, or better yet, simply include only the nonnull columnsstrongp  pI saw a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18276421jooqignoringdatabasecolumnswithdefaultvaluesJOOQ ignoring database columns with default valuesa, but that doesnt seem to resolve this.  Any recommendations on the most concise way to handle thisp  pBy the way, jOOQ has been fantastic to work with so far. Lukas, thank you for this awesome toolp  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pThe not null issue is addressed by Lukass answer below, and thats an easy fix.p  pFor the duplicate primary keys, I am definitely not confusing codeINSERTcode with codeUPDATEcode. When I run the above code slight update since original post, jOOQ seems to arbitrarily pick a starting primary key value for codeOrgPersonIdcode.  For example, when I first load up my environment, jOOQ might start with 11 for codeOrgPersonIdcode.  p  pThen, when I do an codeINSERTcode, jOOQ will attempt to supply a value of 11 for codeOrgPersonIdcode, Ill get the codeERROR duplicate key valuecode and the codeINSERTcode will fail.  If I then repeat the codeINSERTcode, jOOQ uses 12, then 13.  It succeeds or fails based on whether that ID is available, but its not starting with the right ID.p  pThe manual a hrefhttpwww.jooq.orgdoc3.4manualsqlexecutioncrudwithupdatablerecordsidentityvalues relnofollowhttpwww.jooq.orgdoc3.4manualsqlexecutioncrudwithupdatablerecordsidentityvaluesa says that codeIf youre using jOOQs code generator, the above table will generate a org.jooq.UpdatableRecord with an IDENTITY column. This information is used by jOOQ internally, to update IDs after calling storecode.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pOk, I just tried the generated query directly in Postgres and it fails there, too, with the same issue.  So, clearly this is a Postgres issue and not a jOOQ issue.  Ill post the final resolution on that when I find it in case anyone else runs into this.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strongp  pIssue has been resolved. We use FlywayDB another awesome tool to automate our database schema migration, and we had a bunch of codeINSERTcode statements in our Flyway scripts that manually INSERTED the id number.  This was convenient because we wanted to create a bunch of dummy data and wanted to guarantee the right foreign key relationships.p  pBut manually specifying the primary key increment does not advance the Postgres sequence  Hence, we had to cycle through the Postgres sequence before correctly operating jOOQ would get the right sequence value.p  pSolution is to remove all our manual inserts of the primary keys in our demo data migration scripts.  Thanks for your assistance, Lukasp

The webpage will default to the type of videos that the browser can support, whether it is the format or the HTML5 Player vs Flash Player, etc.p  pMy codeWebViewcode is mostly working except there are two issues I keep running into.  Keep in mind, this is a Nexus 5 running on KitKat.  But the app supports back to 2.3 though support for 4.0 is really the most important as we may drop 2.3  3.0 soon.p  pProblem 1  the WebView will open sometimes.  Then after a while, it loads a big blank screen.  That is why I added the history and cache code below, to no avail.

Negative 14642 pI could use some helpguidance on this. Im trying to develop a program that accepts input for over 200 truefalse responses. Currently I only know how to do this by putting 200 items in the XML and then do something likep  precode    etRaw[0]  EditText findViewByIdR.id.etRaw0     etRaw[1]  EditText findViewByIdR.id.etRaw1     etRaw[2]  EditText findViewByIdR.id.etRaw2     etRaw[3]  EditText findViewByIdR.id.etRaw3 codepre  pall the way down to the last item followed by a loop to read it all into an array. It seems this is a long hard way of doing something that might be infinitely easier. p  pI know this is somewhat vague, but if someone can advise me or point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advancep

Negative 14642 pSo I currently have a fairly large JavaFX application that deals with lots of dynamic data, a lot of which can be in unicode, both characters for languages and random unicode values like u0001 are used.p  pThe problem that I have is that on Windows this hasnt been noticed on either Linux or Mac some of these values cause the application to crash and completely stop responding.p  pThe crash report shown below seems to indicate its a problem with the font rendering itself but doesnt show where in my application this is happening. Im currently using JavaFX 2 and packaging the application as an exe bundled with JRE8u05.

Negative 14642 pI have a codeListViewcode, and its child codeViewscode contain many calls to the codeCanvascode on their codeonDrawcode methods such as codedrawPathcode etc. I have found that when you scroll the codeListViewcode, the calls to codeonDrawcode which are frequent cause really jerky scrolling. I have found that you can eliminate this problem by replacing each codeViewcode in the codeListViewcode by an codeImageViewcode where the image codeBitmapcode is created from the original codeViewcode using code like this.p  precodeview.measureView.MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED, View.MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED int bitmapWidth  view.getMeasuredWidth int bitmapHeight  view.getMeasuredHeight view.layout0, 0, bitmapWidth, bitmapHeight Bitmap bitmap  Bitmap.createBitmapbitmapWidth, bitmapHeight, Bitmap.Config.ARGB8888 Canvas canvas  new Canvasbitmap view.drawcanvas codepre  pThis solves the problem of jerky scrolling. However the problem is that the method codeBitmap.createBitmapcode seems prone to throw an codeOutOfMemoryErrorcode. I have read advice on this site that you should never use this method.

Negative 14642 pOk I want to start by saying that I have checked the other posts I could find on here that were having the same issue I am having but none of them fix my issue, two were down to a simple mistake, and the other was to do with PHP session locking, and I am not using sessions.p  pBasically I am running two Ajax requests to two different pages and using the separate data in different ways after the main page calling the requests has loaded.p  pIn an attempt to simplify the problem I have set up this site here would have used jsFiddle but it gets all funny with HttpRequests a hrefhttpajaxtest.freeiz.comajaxcalls.htm relnofollowThe calling pagea  a hrefhttpajaxtest.freeiz.complayer.htm relnofollowOne of the pages being calleda  a hrefhttpajaxtest.freeiz.comhome.htm relnofollowThe second page being calledap  pThe sources of the pages linked above is all the code I am using in my example, nothing more, nothing less. The second ajax call can be turned off in the first link by appending off to the url.p  pThe issue I am seeing in my own private Wamp test server is that both callbacks for the Ajax requests are running but the data passed to the functions is the same where it shouldnt be. Both the first and second callback functions are receiving the responseText from the second call. However, on this web server only the second callback runs, the first one does not run at all unless the second ajaxCall is switched off off. There must be some difference between my private server and the online one, but I cant really recreate that. However, there is still an issue and I am guessing that the solution to one will be the solution to both.p  pbCan anyone tell me why this is happening Am I misunderstanding how HttpRequests work Or is there just some hole in my codeb hr bEDITbp  pHeres the codep  precodelthtmlgt  ltscript srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.1.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascript gt    function ajaxCalldest, callBack, data, method, async, returnXML          method  typeof method  undefined  method  POST         async  typeof async  undefined  async  true         returnXML  typeof returnXML  undefined  returnXML  false             var ajax         if window.XMLHttpRequest          xmlhttpnew XMLHttpRequest              else          xmlhttpnew ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP              xmlhttp.onreadystatechangefunction          if xmlhttp.readyState4 ampamp xmlhttp.status200               returnXML  callBackxmlhttp.responseXML  callBackxmlhttp.responseText                       xmlhttp.openmethod , dest, async       ifmethod  POST         xmlhttp.setRequestHeaderContenttype,applicationxwwwformurlencoded       data  null  xmlhttp.send  xmlhttp.senddata     document.readyfunction    ajaxCallplayer.htm, functionhtml              player.htmlPlayerltbrgt  html             , null  iflocation.hash  off  ajaxCallhome.htm, functionhtml              home.htmlHomeltbrgt  html             , null       ltscriptgt    ltstyle typetextcssgt  wrapper   width 215px   wrapperafter   content   displaynone  clear both  player, home      width 100px     height 100px     border 1px solid black     marginright 5px  player float left home floatright   ltstylegt    ltdiv idwrappergt     ltdiv idplayergtltdivgt     ltdiv idhomegtltdivgt ltdivgt lthtmlgt  codepre  pHome.htmp  precodeI am the text from home.htm codepre  pPlayer.htmp  precodeI am the text from player.htm codepre  phr A couple of things to notep  ol lipThis example is an extremely simplified version of its original application the resulting problem is the same so there is no sense in me showing the original example as it is a lot of code.

Negative 14642 pI have an app with a User table that was populated by an export from the Active Directory user list.

The easy way would be to have a scheduled task that polls AD every so often and updates all user information.  But that might be a bit of a waste, since 99 of the time nothing will have changed between polls.  One answer might be if theres a LastUpdated field anywhere in the AD user list, so I can know whether my information for any given user is up to date.  Is therep  pIf not, is there any way of subscribing to some kind of push notification from AD, so that I dont have to keep checking, but when a user is inserted, updated or deleted, my app will get notifiedp

Negative 14642 pI have a problem of clearing out of the text area in my application. The app has two methods of getting a specific data format searching online database and using a javascript library. p  pFirst method a user types a chemical name in a text field and presses Search button. If requested compound is in the database, a proper format is displayed in the text area.p  pSecond method if the name was not found in the database, then a user can use a JS library to generate a proper format which is displayed in the same text area.p  pIf a user uses database first, the text area contains generated data  from the database which can be replaced by data generated by JS library if a user decides to use it. The problem is that if the text area already has data generated by JS library it cannot be replaced by data from the database when first method is used. I dont know how to clear the text area containing data generated by JS library before inserting data from the database.

Negative 14642 pIve a ComboBox that is bound to a changing list of users. That list can change based on the filter preferences of the user. The ComboBox itself displays only the users name, but I have several labels which I would like to display various values of the user selected in the ComboBox.p  pIve already noticed that it doesnt work as when I set the filters to return nothing, the combobox is supposed to be given a dummy datasource a simple anonymous object with property values that meet the criteria for the combobox .DisplayMember property, as well as the values to which the labels are bound.p  pI would like the labels text to change whenever the user selects another user from the ComboBox.p  pI know the reason binding the labels to the ComboBox.SelectedValue isnt working is because it just binds their properties to the properties of the object at the time the binding is set.

Negative 14642 pI have 332 csv files, each with a different number of NA rows. For each of the 332 files, I need to assess whether or not they meet a minimum threshold of complete cases.

Ultimately I need to return a vector that contains the correlation value for each file that met the threshold. So if the threshold  50, I need separate correlation values for each file where complete cases 50.p  pMy concern is that, regardless of the specified threshold of complete cases, my cor function always returns the same single value 0.2225526.

Negative 14642 pId like to fork a repo with the intention of breaking ties with the original repo.  There will be no pull requests or any future merges whatsoever.  The new repo will have a new project name.  The only reason I dont copy the source files and start an entirely new repo from scratch is because Id like to preserve the commit history.  How do I do thisp  pstrongClarificationstrong  I do use Github.  I wasnt previously aware that there was anything Githubspecific.  For my specific needs, I have a git repo that houses two separate projects one Scala, one Java.  The files for the two projects have started interfering with each other, so Im going to fork the repo, and in the new repo delete all the files for the Scala project.  In the original repo, Ill delete all the files for the Java project.p

Negative 14642 pIm quite new to C and Im having some trouble with a program to transfer files from one hard drive to another. The PC the program will be running from doesnt have any kind of compiler, so I want to build in the aility for the source and destination paths to change without having to recompile the program. As it currently stands, in the current directory there are two text files  one with the source path, the other with the destination. The program reads the lines from these files and uses these respective paths for the transfer.p  pTo simplify things from my end, to keep the program running continuously as this is required I have set a 1 second loop as opposed to using system threading.p  pI think the problem lies with using string variables as the directory paths in the system command  because if I hard code paths in this command the transfer works successfully.

Negative 14642 pIm trying to use Antlr4.5 to generate a C lexerparser for a grammar. What sort of tools would you recommend in order to write the grammar and to test it p  pIm trying antlrworks2 but I find it a bit confusing cant find a way to enter sample text and see the parse tree  not sure if its not there or Im blind or just plain dumb, but Im pretty sure antlrworks v1 had such a feature.p  pThe Visual Studio VSIX plugin from Sam Harwell looks great but it also confuses the heck out of me, the lexer and parser get generated in the obj folder instead of inside the project. Also, it wont help me much when writing the grammar as far as showing me a syntax diagram, letting me try out the grammar with sample text and so on. p  pIm pretty confident that antlr is a good way to go with its adaptive LL parsing, but Im really not sure about the tooling and the approach I should take when defining and testing my grammar. Am I missing something I would appreciate any guidance you could give me. p

Negative 14642 pI am looking for options to extract the main image from a product page on a retailer website, the problem is there are multiple images in a product page related images , one approach I thought would work would be to extract all the image links, download each one of them and compare the size of each of those images and consider the one has the largest size in terms of storage bytes as the one that is the main product image.p  pObviously that would be a very inefficient approach , we know that most of the retailers use certain ecommerce platforms like magento , bigcommerce etc, the major ecommerce platforms are only handful , is it possible to detect the ecommerce platform and leverage the template provided by each one of them to precisely extract the main product imagep  pI know the approach would never be perfect , but I am looking an algorithm that would be mostly accurate about 80 or so , is it doablep

Negative 14642 pSo I understand that Spark can perform iterative algorithms on single RDDs for example Logistic regression.p  precode    val points  spark.textFile....mapparsePoint.cache     var w  Vector.randomD  current separating plane     for i lt 1 to ITERATIONS        val gradient  points.mapp gt         1  1  expp.yw dot p.x  1  p.y  p.x       .reduce         w  gradient      codepre  pThe above example is iterative because it maintains a global state codewcode that is updated after each iteration and its updated value is used in the next iteration.  Is this functionality possible in Spark streaming  Consider the same example, except now codepointscode is a DStream.  In this case, you could create a new DStream that calculates the gradient with p  precodeval gradient  points.mapp gt             1  1  expp.yw dot p.x  1  p.y  p.x           .reduce   codepre  pBut how would you handle the global state codewcode.  It seems like codewcode would have to be a DStream too using codeupdateStateByKeycode maybe, but then its latest value would somehow need to be passed into the codepointscode map function which I dont think is possible.  I dont think DStreams can communicate in this way.  Am I correct, or is it possible to have iterative computations like this in Spark Streamingp

Negative 14642 pIm running into an unpleasant issue I dont know how to solve properly.p  pScenario p  pMainActivity has a method handleIncomingIntentp  pThis method parses the Extras coming in the incoming intent for service, or broadcast receiver and opens Child Activities based on an intent data. So, when the incoming Intent has data of type A it will startActivityActivityA.class, if of type B then startActivityActivityB.class if no data it will stay in MainActivityp  pProblem is when device is low on memory, MainActivity is destroyed, while in ActivityA or ActivityB. p  pTherefore when BackButton is used  the MainActivity gets restored and its incoming Intent is restored at the same state as before handling it despite the fact Im doing incomingIntent.removeExtrasKEY in the end of my handleIncomingIntent method. So the outcome is  its starting the Child Activity once again and its a loopp  pI realize that I can store some isIntentConsumed flag into memory inside onDestroy and then read it restoreSavedState and use it to dismiss the intent since its already consumed.p  pI just feel there must be a better way than a bandaid that I just described.p  pKind Regards,  Pavelp

I need to find the pdf, cdf and quantile function for the Energy in a given time interval [t1,t2] from this data  say e, E, and qe.p  pClearly energy is the integral of the power over [t1,t2], but how do I best calculate e, E and qe  p  pMy best guess is that since qp,t is a power, I should generate qe by integrating q over the time interval, and then calculate the other distributions from that.p  pIs it as simple as that, or do I need to get to grips with stochastic calculus p  pstrongAdditional details for clarificationstrongp  pThe data were getting is a timeseries of blackbox forecasts for fP, FP,qP for each time t, where P is the instantaneous power and there will be around 100 forecasts for the interval Id like to get the eP for. By Blackbox I mean that there will be a function I can call to evaluate f,F,q for P, but I dont know the underlying distribution.p  pThe blackbox functions are almost certainly interpolating output data from the model that produces the power forecasts, but we dont have access to that. I would guess that it strongwontstrong be anything straightforward, since it comes from a chain of nonlinear transformations. Its actually wind farm production forecasts the wind speeds may be normally distributed, but multiple terrain and turbine transformations will change that.p  pstrongFurther clarificationstrong Ive edited the original text to remove confusing variable names in the energy distribution functions.p  pThe forecasts will be provided as followsp  pThe interval [t1,t2] that we need e, E and qe for is subdivided into 100 say subintervals k1...100. For each k we are given a distinct fP, call them fkP. We need to calculate the energy distributions for the interval from this set of fkP.p

Negative 14642 pMy app listens for location updates even while the app is running in background, and I need to save the locations my codeCLLocationManagercode object receives. I actually need to create and save a CustomLocation managed object that will have some of the information I get in the codeCLLocationcode objects. Every time the codelocationManagerdidUpdateLocationscode delegate method is called, I insert a CustomLocation into the managed object context, and I add such object to an array. Then, when I already have N CustomLocation objects in the array, I save the context, to avoid saving it everytime the location changes and I receive a new one.p  pThe point is, while Im saving the current context, and removing objects both from the context and the array after saving, I could receive new locations in codelocationManagerdidUpdateLocationscode, so I could have a conflict of objects in the context and the array.p  pDo I actually need to add the managed objects to an array And how could I better manage this whole scenariop  pThanks in advancep

The issue is coming up that some accounts are exactly a penny off at the end of the season.p  pIm using SQL Server Express, with two tables.

Negative 14642 pI have multiple arduinos that Im accessing from a web app the web app is deployed on a beagle bone running tomcat. The problem is where to put the open devices Im opening them with a BufferedReader for input and a FileOutputStream for output. Im currently considering three options have the open device in an application scoped bean, a session scoped bean or a view scoped bean. Each option has a problem. In an application scoped bean, over time, hours, the device times out and closes but leaves the handles intact. In a session scoped bean, there is the distinct possibility that the bean will be serialized and the device handles will be set to null when its deserialized. In a view scoped bean, unless I make a hardware mod, the arduino will restart every time the device is opened Request scoped has this same problem but worse. I believe that Java doesnt have functionality to check if a stream is actually open you just have to write to it and see if it throws an IOexception. I could catch that exception and then attempt reopening the device but Im not sure that wouldnt lead to some other problems. So, which is the best of the three options or is there some other way that elegantly solves the problemp

Negative 14642 pIm trying to create a XAML app for windows tablet and for some reason its not displaying some webpage correctly. It shows up fine when I try to access the erroneous webpage using Internet Explorer. One such problem is that some images appear rotated 90 degrees to the left when it shouldnt and that tables dont appear to be separating sections of the webpage properly.p  pFrom what Ive read after hours of googling the issue, this is because the webview control utilizes an outdated version of IE, but when I checked www.whatismybrowser.com using the webview control it says that its using the most updated version so Im confused as to why this is happening.p  pAny workarounds or alternatives would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 14642 pI have a table that stores information about categories cats lets say and another table say cars meaning it stores infos about cars  a lame example, but that doesnt matter that has a column called parentcatid which should reference id col in cats. Now comes the problem any car from cars could belong to more then one category. Theres an obvious, but very lame, solution store in parentcatid a delimited list of numbers, but, if i apply that, I couldnt have any foreign key constraint and should jump into parsing these values. Although parsing isnt such a big deal, but I cant believe MySQL doesnt have anything prebuilt. Also it looks like selecting cars by category will involve some substring and other things. Having no foreign key is a far bigger problem. The only thing I was able to find is a SET type, but it should be predefined what values it can store during database development, also it can have only 64 predefined values while there could be 100s of categories.p

Negative 14642 pI asked this on wordpress.stackexchange but it didnt get much attention, so I thought to ask here.p  pWith the new wordpress 4.3 we have Menus included inside the Customizer Appearance  Customize, which is a part of a move to put everything that can be changed live inside the Customizer better user experience I guess. p  pThe Menu works fine, its just one thing thats been bothering me and I havent find a way to work it out. My menu has several additions or upgrades if you will. Ive added the megamenu option to it, Ive added the possibility for user to put a sidebar in the menu aimed for putting the widgets in the megamenu, and Ive also managed to create a way for a user to choose an icon to put beside the menu name like you have a description field.p  pEverything works fine, and Ive done it by changing the walker function, and added javascript etc.p  pWhat is not working though, is that any change I made is not visible in the customizer, only in the admin menus page Appearance  Menus.p  pThis is kinda a big deal to me, since in a few versions, wordpress will probably remove the menus page all together and use Customizer exclusively.p  pSo my question is, how can I make it that all my custom additions appear in the customizer menus p  pI added the icon field following this gist a hrefhttpsgist.github.comwestonruter3802459 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comwestonruter3802459ap  pAnd for instance, I added the custom metabox for the sidebar like thisp  precodeSidebars in Menu  if  classexistssidebarscustommenu      class sidebarscustommenu          public function addnavmenumetaboxes              addmetabox                 sidebarmenuadd,                 eschtmlAdd Sidebar, mytheme,                 array this, navmenulink,                 navmenus,                 side,                 low                                public function navmenulink gt             ltdiv idposttypesidebars classposttypedivgt                 ltdiv idtabspanelsidebars classtabspanel tabspanelactivegt                     ltul id sidebarschecklist classcategorychecklist formnocleargt                         ltphp                         i  1                         foreach  GLOBALS[wpregisteredsidebars] as sidebar                               obstart                             dynamicsidebarsidebar[id]                             sidebarhtml  obgetclean                             gt                             ltligt                                 ltlabel classmenuitemtitlegt                                     ltinput typecheckbox classmenuitemcheckbox namemenuitem[ltphp echo escattri gt][menuitemobjectid] valueltphp echo sidebar[id] gtgt ltphp echo ucwords sidebar[name]  gt                                 ltlabelgt                                 ltinput typehidden classmenuitemtype namemenuitem[ltphp echo escattri gt][menuitemtype] valuecustomgt                                 ltinput typehidden classmenuitemattrtitle namemenuitem[ltphp echo escattri gt][menuitemattrtitle] valueltphp echo ucwords sidebar[name]  gtgt                                 ltinput typehidden classmenuitemtitle namemenuitem[ltphp echo escattr i  gt][menuitemtitle] valueampnbsp gt                                 ltinput typehidden classmenuitemurl namemenuitem[ltphp echo escattri gt][menuitemurl] valuegt                                 ltinput typehidden classmenuitemclasses namemenuitem[ltphp echo escattri gt][menuitemclasses] valuemenusidebargt                                 ltinput typehidden classmenuitemdescription namemenuitem[ltphp echo escattri gt][menuitemdescription] valueltphp echo sidebar[id] gtgt                             ltligt                             ltphp                             i                                                   gt                     ltulgt                 ltdivgt                 ltp classbuttoncontrolsgt                     ltspan classlistcontrolsgt                         lta hrefltphp echo adminurl navmenus.phppagetaballampampselectall1posttypesidebars  gt classselectallgtltphp eschtmleSelect All, mytheme gtltagt                     ltspangt                     ltspan classaddtomenugt                         ltinput typesubmit classbuttonsecondary submitaddtomenu right valueltphp eschtmleAdd to Menu, mythemegt nameaddposttypemenuitem idsubmitposttypesidebarsgt                         ltspan classspinnergtltspangt                     ltspangt                 ltpgt             ltdivgt         ltphp         customnav  new sidebarscustommenu  addactionadmininit, arraycustomnav, addnavmenumetaboxes codepre  pWhich gives me thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com0szUY.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0szUY.png altenter image description hereap  pHowever, when I go to the customizer and try to add a menu I see thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comquldo.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comquldo.png altenter image description hereap  pThere is no Add Sidebar here or menu field in the pages dropdown.p  pI tried to find information how to do it on the web but found nothing.

I compile and run it as an EXE and it runs perfectly fine, sends the HTTP POST request almost instantly, doesnt get stuck on codeHttpSendRequestAcode ... What the heck is going on And how can I get around thisp  pIf you guys want to test it yourself, simply create a simple application as a DLL file with WinInet Http POST request code, and give it a coderun with rundll32.execode  why does it get stuck on codeHttpSendRequestcode, but when the same application is ran as an EXE without the codeDllMaincode, and codeWinMaincode instead, it works just fine... p  pstrongEditstrongp  pWhen I say codeget stuckcode, what I mean is, provided the following context ran as a DLLp  precodeMessageBoxA0, HttpSendRequestA, IN, 0, 0 if HttpSendRequestAhRequest, Headers, 1, DataToSend, lstrlenADataToSend  FALSE     it worked, continue, to check  i put a messagebox here   MessageBoxA0, Function returned successfully, Notification, 0  MessageBoxA0, HttpSendRequestA, OUT, 0, 0 codepre  pSo, after the codeHttpSendRequestA, INcode messagebox appears. The function executes, however, neither the messagebox appears afterwards the function failed, or inside the condition success. However When I run the same code as an EXE, the flow of the application executes just as expected all messageboxes are displayed to the user.p  pIs that a little more clear Im still very confused, and I need a solution for this All help is appreciated, greatly Ive been sitting on this for a few hours now... At first I thought it was just my code, but then I tried to run the application as an EXE, it worked fine, at that point I became extremely confused.p
