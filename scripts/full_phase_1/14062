Positive 14062 pI have implemented 10 concurrent consumers on one of my queues. The queue will continuously process the messages and as i am using concurrent consumers there are always some inflight messages on the queue and when i shutdown the route, camel is triggering the  default shutdown strategy timeout of 300 seconds. After researching i came to know that inflight messages are the result of some threads which are trying to process the messages. I have the following questions on the inflight messagesp  p1.when i shutdown the route what happens to the inflight messages. Do we lose them or will they get processed. is there any chance they rollback to the queue.p  precodeltbeanidshutdownStrategyclassorg.apache.camel.impl.DefaultShutdownStrategygt       ltproperty nametimeout value30 gt ltbeangt  codepre  ol start2 liI have used the above shutdown strategy and specified the timeout to 30 seconds and the route shutdowns as expected even though there are inflight messages. By using the code i have learned that camel will aggressively shutdowns the route and we lose all the inflight messages.Is that true, if yes, how can i avoid loosing the messages.li ol  pAny help on this is appreciated.p
Positive 14062 pWe are using Apache Camel File Poller in our project and we are running into one issue.  We drop files into a directory and it processes it perfectly and transfers it to the correct directory.  If a file that is dropped into the incoming directory is too big, we have readLockTimeout and readLockCheckIntervals that will try to acquire lock if its fully transferred, else it will retry every few seconds.  HERE IS WHERE OUR ISSUE IS.p  pLets say I drop FileA3gb, FileB250mb, FileC300MB and the first lock that camel acquires is FileA.  Ideally, FileA is still being transferred into that directory because it is so huge  So what camel is doing is its trying to acquire the lock on it and fails and does it every few seconds, which is PERFECTLY OK.  The part that is not ok is that FileB and FileC are just sitting there waiting until FileA is processed.  What my question is how can i make the lock act SEQUENTIALLY.  What I mean is if it acquires the lock on FileA and its still processing, it skips the file and goes to FileB then processes that.  p

Positive 14062 pI am working on a application using Apache Camel Routes to process the requests. I want to add caching to each of the routes. So, that if the requested data is already in cache, we do not need to execute the processing in the route, otherwise the route logic would be executed.p  pI want to know how we can transparently add caching to each of the routes. I initially thought of adding a check for cached content at start of route and proceeding based on the results. Also, a step to add the route response to cache at end of the route. But, I think this approach makes caching logic coupled with route logic.Bu,stil we know what to cache and if we have to cache if it is within the routes.p  pI am looking for a way which I can use to add this as Aspect as in AOP.p  pIs this possible in Camel.

Negative 14062 pI joined a new company about a month ago. The company is rather small in size and has pretty strong startup feel to it. Im working as a Java developer on a team of 3 others. The company primarily sells a service to for businessesbusinesstype people to use in communicating with each other.p  pOne of the main things I have been, and will be working on, is the main website for the company  from which the service is sold, existing users login to check their service and pay their bills, new users can sign up for a trial, etc. Currently this is a JSP application deployed on Tomcat, with access to a database done thru a persistence layer written by the company itself.p  pA repeated and growing frustration I am having here and Im pretty happy with the job overall, so this isnt an oh no I dont like my jobtype post is the lack of any larger design or architecture for this web application. The app is made up of several dozen JSP pages, with almost no logic existing in Servlets or Beans or any other sort of framework. Many of the JSP pages are thousands of lines of code, they codejspincludecode other JSP pages, business logic is mixed in with the HTML, frequently used snippets of code such as obtaining a web service connection is cut and paste rather than reused, etc. In other words, the application is a mess.p  pThere have been some rumblings within the company of trying to rearchitect this site so that it fits MVC better I think that the developers and higherups are beginning to realize that this current pattern of spaghetti code isnt sustainable or very easily scalable to add more features for the users. The higherups and developers are wary of completely rewriting the thing with good reason, since this would mean several weeks or months of work rewriting existing functionality, but weve had some discussions of slowly rewriting certain areas of the site into a new framework.p  pWhat are some of the best strategies to enable moving the application and codebase into this direction How can I as a developer really help move this along, and quickly, without seeming like the jerky new guy who comes into a job and tells everyone that what theyve written is crap Are there any proven strategies or experiences that youve used in your own job experience when youve encountered this sort of thingp
Negative 14062 pI would like to know what kind of tool you use for writing your specifications.

I am basically just looking to use CodeIgniter for MVC, and to enforce a more modular aspect for my projects.p  pstrongCODE FLOW amp CONFIGstrongp  pI have a few config items that need to be done before almost anything else.  p  pFor example, say I have a constant codeAPPLIVEcode, which is set truefalse based on the name of the current server. This has to happen really early as paths, error reporting, the CodeIgniter system, and application folders, etc. will be set based on it.p  pThe problem is that the codesystemfoldercode, and codeapplicationfoldercode which will be set based on which server the code is running on are set first thing in the codeindex.phpcode file, before any of the configs have loaded.p  pAlso, I have a functions that check for things in the URL, and may redirect before the page ever loads.  For example, some pages need to enfore the presence of codewww.code in the URL for SEO, track affiliates, visitor sources, marketing flags, etc.p  pWhere is the best place to put things like this that have to happen really early  I know there is a config file, an autoload file, a constants file, etc., but those are too late for some items. Is it a bad practice to simply put these things into the top of the main codeindex.phpcode file, or to make an include there to a global config file Again, I feel like I am stepping outside the framework, and wonder if Im just doing that because I dont have a solid understanding of it yetp  pstrongLAYOUT  HEADER FOOTERstrongp  pLike most people, I have a top header, navigation, footer, etc. I am used to just having them in files, which are included into my page template.

Negative 14062 pI am currently working on an advanced web application that contains a number of Dynamically Rendered pages.  The pages are standard pages which contain a place holder into which the main content is rendered from a combination of Xml and Xslt.p  pI have recently been attempting to add a ASP.Net Ajax Toolkit collapsible entender to allow the collapsing and extending of the panels which are dynamically rendered.  I have added the extender markup to our main xslt template and all is fine.  Well all is fine until a post back takes place and the panels return to their intial state.  So, for example, if I load the page with the panels collapsed then after postback the page fails to reset any open panels,  The problem is caused by the fact that I store the dynamic content in the viewstate itself and once the page is loaded just retrieve it from the viewstate rather than rerender the Xml.p  pPhew.... there is the background to the problem.p  pNow the main question.  How on earth can you interact with the extender in Javascript.  I have spent days convinced that I could cache the state in a page variable client side and then reapply the state post postback.  However, there appears to be no documentation or knowledge of how to accomplish this.  The best I have found is some very simple javascript which will allow you to register a couple of events to catch when the panel is extended or collapsed.p  pAll I want to do is interact and cache each panels state.  Can anyone suggest anythingp

For example, some image types have a number between 0255 for grayscale defined at each pixel coordinate X, Y, Z, Time, Channel. In that scenario, I just want to grab the hexvalue at the coordinate, and put it in the correct order according to the .tif designation above.p  pAlso, this would run in windows and mac for now. Would it be possible to do it in Pythonp

Also, trying to make it go the other way around with STRAIGHTJOIN, first selecting a 10k subset from smaller tabsmall and then using it to search in larger tabbig gives much worse results than default Edit with a small dataset that I have now to test on on production data it would apparently be the other way around and EXPLAIN would look like the second one.p  precode  id  selecttype  table      type    possiblekeys    key      keylen  ref                                        rows     Extra                                            1  SIMPLE       tabbig    range   PRIMARY,id1      PRIMARY  4        NULL                                       1374793  Using where Using temporary Using filesort     1  SIMPLE       tabsmall  eqref  PRIMARY,idb     PRIMARY  12       const,db.tabbig.id1,db.tabbig.id2              1  Using index                                     codepre  pOn larger datasets EXPLAIN would probably look more like this disregard the rows values though  its taken from a smaller datasetp  precode  id  selecttype  table      type  possiblekeys        key      keylen  ref               rows   Extra                                            1  SIMPLE       tabsmall  ref   PRIMARY,idb,id1     PRIMARY  4        const               259  Using index Using temporary Using filesort     1  SIMPLE       tabbig    ref   PRIMARY,id1          id1      4        db.tabsmall.id1  25692  Using where                                     codepre  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 14062 pIm having some trouble with a recursive relationship in core data.  Ive got a managed object called a SearchCategory, and that category can have Categories and it can also have a Category.  In the managed object modeler, Ive got two relationships set up on the SearchCategory entity, and both point back to the SearchCategory entity  one is named Categories and is a tomany relationship.  The other is Category, is not a tomany, and is the inverse of Categories.p  pIn my code Im using setCategoriesObject to add categories to a searchcategory, which seems to be working.  However, when I say code[mySearchCategory setCategoryaParentCategory]code, where codemySearchCategorycode would be a child category of codeaParentCategorycode, it doesnt seem to want take in memory.  If I run the above code, then code[managedobjectcontext saveamperr]code, it actually saves the primary key of the parent category to the Category field of the child category in the database, but Core Data doesnt synthesize this relationship at run time, so code[mySearchCategory Category]code returns nil.

The error occurred   while evaluating nil.sizep blockquote  pBased on the current user, when they navigate to a page, I want to limit them to what they can see based on their site. Problem is there is no association between site and user table directly. A contact hasone user user information is stored in currentuser variable. A site hasmany contacts. And a site hasmany students, where students table has a foreign key of siteid. So there is a link between students and site, so when the current user navigates to students page, they can only see students from same site as them. I can do this by hard coding a number in a namedscope to only display students for the site of the currentuser. But different users will belong to different sites so when logged in, the site their associated with will change. Thats the problem  to dynamically set that value in a namedscope. This is what I havep  pStudentsControllerp  precodedef indexscoper   if currentuser.roleid  8     super.sitestafflimit while currentuser[siteid]      The problem is the user table has no siteid.

Negative 14062 pIt is trivial to use a secure hash function like SHA256 and continuing to use md5 for security is reckless behavior.   However,  there are some complexities to hash function vulnerabilities that I would like to better understand. p  pCollisions have been a hrefhttpwebcache.googleusercontent.comsearchqcache3aNdD5az6TttQJ3awww.stachliu.comresearchcollisions.htmlmd4md5collisiongeneratorampcd1amphlenampctclnkampglusgenerated for md4 and md5.a  According to NIST md5 is not a secure hash function. It only takes a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMD5Collisionvulnerabilities239th operations to generate a collisiona and should never be a hrefhttpcwe.mitre.orgdatadefinitions327.htmlused for passwordsa.  However SHA1 is vulnerable to a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSha1SHA1similar collision attacka in which a collision can be found in 269 operations,  where as brute force is 280th.  No one has generated a sha1 collision and a hrefhttpcsrc.nist.govgroupsSTtoolkitsecurehashing.htmlNIST still lists sha1 as a secure message digest functiona. p  pSo when is it safe to use a broken hash function  Even though a function is broken it can still be big enough.   a hrefhttpwww.schneier.comblogarchives200502sha1broken.htmlAccording to Schneiera a hash function vulnerable to a collsion attack can still be used as an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHMACHMACa.  I believe this is because the security of an HMAC is Dependant on its secret key and a collision cannot be found until this key is obtained.  Once you have the key used in a HMAC its already broken,  so its a moot point.  What hash function vulnerabilities would undermine the security of an HMAC  p  pLets take this property a bit further.  Does it then become safe to use a very weak message digest like md4 for passwords if a salt is perpended to the password   Keep in mind the md4 and md5 attacks are prefixing attacks,  and if a salt is perpended then an attacker cannot control the prefix of the message.   If the salt is truly a secret, and isnt known to the attacker, then does it matter if its a appended to the end of the password  Is it safe to assume that an attacker cannot generate a collision until the entire message has been obtained p  pDo you know of other cases where a broken hash function can be used in a security context without introducing a vulnerability p  pPlease post supporting evidence because it is awesomep

Negative 14062 pI am stuck with a design problem that I hope you guys can help with. I have a few different classes that have various parameters more than 20 in each case, and they are mostly different, although some are exactly the same in which case they inherit from a base class. I want to control these parameters through the user of a class called ObjectProperties. Each class will create ObjectProperties and populate it with its own parameter list when the class is initialized. This is done with a map which is set up like sop  precodestdmapltstdstring, [datatype]gt  where [datatype] can be an int, float, bool, string etc. codepre  pthe string is the name for the parameter and the data type is the type its associated with. This is done for easy scripting later on instead of having 20 getterssetters. I have already made the ObjectProperties class, but it is less than ideal. I have a structure with all the possible data types called DataTypeStruct and a variable for the map in the ObjectProperties class called pDataTypeMapp  precodetypedef struct     int IntValue    float FloatValue    bool BoolValue    stdstring StringValue DataTypeStruct  stdmapltstdstring, DataTypeStructgt pDataTypeMap codepre  pWhen a class wants to add a parameter for manipulation, it calls one of the following functions, which then creates a new structure appropriately and pairs it with the name to be put in the map. The function returns true or false depending on whether it was able to insert it or not if false, then the name already existsp  precodebool AddParamstdstring aName, int aParam bool AddParamstdstring aName, float aParam bool AddParamstdstring aName, bool aParam bool AddParamstdstring aName, stdstring aString codepre  pThe reason strongaParamstrong isare pointers is because it is required that the parameters must be passed by reference so that they can be manipulated later on. p  pTo change the value for the parameter I have similar functions. As you can see, this is less than ideal, as I have wasted some space with the structure where each new structure only stores an int OR a bool OR a string OR a float, and calling overloaded functions is unsafe I can make the functions have unique names, but again, that is less than ideal.p  pI hope I have explained the design issue that I have come across it is a little difficult to explain and would really like to hear suggestions on how to go about solving this problem. p

Negative 14062 pHas anybody got any experience of using HTTP byte ranges across multiple parallel requests to speed up downloadsp  pI have an app that needs to download fairly large images from a web service 1MB  and then send out the modified files resized and cropped to the browser.

Negative 14062 pRelevant question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2205327androidsqliteonetomanydesignAndroid SQLite onetomany designap  pThis is my first post on here, and its also my first time dealing with databases. If there are any clarifications, or corrections I can make, please let me know. p  pIm trying to set up an SQLite database to better store items collected from an RSS Feed. Im trying to have a 3 table setup. It looks like thisp  pTable 1 The Channel Table items stay in constant orderp  blockquote   pid  Feed Location  Channel Title  Channel Description  ...p blockquote  pbr Table 2 The Item Table The items should be stored in chronological order for ease of access and deletionp  blockquote   pid  Item Title ... Channel ID  ...p blockquote  pWhere Channel ID has the row number that the Channel the item is part of is located. p  pThat part is pretty simple, but heres my problem. I want to be able to query items by the categories that are relevant to them. Theyre included in the XML thatll be parsed, and itd be great to sort by those values. So I started to set up another table, and implement the same onetomany relationship described above, but then I ran into a problem. Because the ids of those items are likely to change when more items are parsed, the ids arent static, and I cant have the categories link the way I did earlier. Also, another challenge I found was the fact that each category mightve ideally needed to point to many different items because the Items couldve been relevant to the same Category. p  pAnd thats where Im stuck. p

Negative 14062 pThe scenario presents itself where I have an object that stores an outside selector for later use. By design, I would like to be able to add two kinds of selectors.

Negative 14062 pIve been trying to understand how to draw graphics on Android using a hierarchy of custom views, custom viewgroups, and relativeLayouts. Im having a hard time figuring out how to have the parents tell the children where to position themselves and at what size. I think it is working when the custom ViewGroup tells its children to be a certain size, but I cant figure out how to have the relativeLayout tell its ViewGroup children what size and position to be. Right now, the following code draws a circle in the top and center of the screen. This is Android 3.0 on the Xoom. The size of the circle is 295x295, so Im assuming this is somehow the default size and position of a layout Can anyone give me the code that would be needed so that I could programatically pick the size and location of the viewgroup that contains the view that contains the circle The edges of the circle on the four sides are getting trimmed off just so, so I know that the relativelayout is cutting off the rest of the viewgroup from printing. If I have the ViewGroup measure the View at a smaller size, it will print it at that size up in the left corner of that same rectangle in the top center of the screen.p  pMy Activitys onCreatep  precode public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     CustomViewGroup custVG  new CustomViewGroupthis     RelativeLayout rel  new RelativeLayoutgetApplicationContext     rel.setLayoutParamsnew LayoutParamsLayoutParams.FILLPARENT, LayoutParams.FILLPARENT      rel.addViewcustVG      RelativeLayout.LayoutParams params2  new RelativeLayout.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT,                       LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT       params2.addRuleRelativeLayout.ALIGNPARENTRIGHT        rel.addViewnew CustomViewGroupgetApplicationContext,1,             new ViewGroup.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT,LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT      setContentViewrel   codepre  pMy Custom made ViewGroupp  precodeCustomView cust int height int width  public CustomViewGroupContext context      supercontext     cust  new CustomViewcontext      Canvas canvas  new Canvas      this.addViewcust,new RelativeLayout.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT    Override  public void onDrawCanvas canvas     this.drawChildcanvas,cust,0      Override protected void onLayoutboolean arg0, int arg1, int arg2, int arg3, int arg4       cust.layoutthis.getLeft, this.getTop, this.getRight, this.getBottom   Override protected void onMeasureint widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec      Measure the only child     this.measureChildcust,widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec      height  View.MeasureSpec.getSizeheightMeasureSpec     width  View.MeasureSpec.getSizewidthMeasureSpec     setMeasuredDimensionheight, width  codepre  pMy Custom Viewp  precodepublic CustomViewContext context     supercontext    Override public void onDrawCanvas canvas       float noteRadius  width2      Paint paint  new Paint     paint.setAntiAliastrue     paint.setColorColor.YELLOW     paint.setStylePaint.Style.STROKE     float strokeWidth  paint.getStrokeWidth     paint.setStrokeWidthstrokeWidth      canvas.drawCircleheight2, width2, noteRadius, paint       Override     protected void onMeasureint widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec           height  View.MeasureSpec.getSizeheightMeasureSpec         width  View.MeasureSpec.getSizewidthMeasureSpec         Log.iCustomView onMeasure,Width   width   Height   height          setMeasuredDimensionheight, width      codepre  pSorry this is long.

Negative 14062 pObviously Id love to use a credit card vault to store cards. But our business model doesnt allow for this.p  pFor example our clients are corporations, they create accounts in our software. Each account has its own set of users. They want to charge their users credit card through their own gateway. On the other hand, we service their users as well. So we will need to charge their cards through our own gateway which is different.p  pThat said, we both need to charge the same card on different gateways. Not to mention it is possible that our clients gateway wont have a credit card vault. So this makes using a traditional credit card vault impossible.p  pThe only feasible solution, as far as we can tell, is to store the card in our own database. Id like to avoid this if possible.p  pDoes anyone know if there are 3rd party vaults that let you store sensitive information, and pull that information out Or if there is an alternate solution to the problem Im describingp  pIve yet to find a credit card vault that lets you store the card information and also retrieve it read amp write.p  pIm sure Im not the first person to encounter this, any help is greatly appreciated.

Negative 14062 pI have a question regarding how to determine the Duration of notes given their Onset Locations.p  pSo for example, I have an array of amplitude values containing short and another array of the same size, that contains a 1 if a note onset is detected, and a 0 if not. So basically, the distance between each 1 will be used to determine the duration.p  pHow can I do this I know that I have to use the Sample Rate and other attributes of the audio data, but is there a particular formula that I can usep  pThank youp

Negative 14062 pIm looking to create a program which will run in the background, but will capture any data input by a barcode scanner. Since barcode scanners work more or less as keyboards Im not familiar with the specifics of the implementation, but my reading and their behaviour suggests this my plan was to simply capture all keypresses and look for a distinctive pattern sequence of numbers entered in improbably fast succession.p  pIm a little concerned, however, about the fact that this will require holding up keypresses until I confirm a match. The holdup will probably be barely noticable, but its still not ideal. My quesetion is is there any better means of implementation than simple key and pattern detection, for example detecting that the keypresses originate from a barcode scannerp  pThanks for any help you can offer, Wyattp

Negative 14062 pIm not sure if this is an odd setup to begin with, but heres my problem regardlessp  pI have a git repository at the following git.foo.comreposfoo.com.gitp  pI clone that repository both on my local machine and my server, such that when I make changes to my local checkout, commit and push, I can do a pull and the changes are reflected on the live site.  Its how I guess I deploy from local to live for now.p  pHowever, because I have a WP setup and there are assets that are copied to my server and processed for example made into cacheable resources and shrunk for mobile if theyre images, Id like to have the deployment work backwards and automatically as well.p  pLocally this is fine because I have SSH keys setup to validate me, such that doing git push goes off without a hitch.  However, when I do git push on the server after some files have been added and processed, it prompts for a password and makes it impossible to automize.p  pWhat are my options at this point  Ive tried inputting the password via a text file, which I dont feel comfortable with in the first place since thats bad practice Ive tried setting up SSH keys on my server which seems odd since it would be validating itself...p  pIm at a loss for words as to how to describe my problem, but hopefully someone has encountered a similar problem with backwards deployment having changes on the server be committed and pushed to the repository.p  pThanksp

Negative 14062 pIf I have an insert statement with a bunch of values where the first value is an id thats also the primary key to my database, how can I check if everything else in those values is not completely the same and to update the fields that are different second part not necessary for an answer, but itd be nice. If its too convoluted to do the second part I can just delete the record first and then insert the full line of updated valuesp  pIm guessing that it has something to do with codeSELECT FROM TABLE1  WHERE id1code and then somehow do an inequality statement with the codeINSERT INTO TABLE1 VALUES 1,A... etc.code but Im not sure how to write that.p  pEdit I think I asked the question wrong so Ill try againp  pI have a database that has first column id that is a primary key and then a lot of other columns, too long to type out by hand. I have a script that will get data and I will not know if this data is a duplicate or not e.g.p  precodeid    value 1     dog 2     cat codepre  pif the new info coming in is 1, dog then I need a signal say boolean that tells me true, if the new info is 1, monkey then I need a signal that tells me false on the match and then update every single field. The question is how do I generate the boolean value that tells me whether the new values with the same id is completely identical to the one in the db It has to check every single filed of long list of fields that will take forever to type out, any type of output would be good as long as I can tell one means its different and one means its the samep  pA side question is how do I update the row after that since I dont want to type out every single field, my temporary solution is to delete the row with the out of date primary id and then insert the new data in but if there is a fast way to update all columns in a row thatd be great.p

Negative 14062 pI am looking for some help, not being spoon feed source code which from some of the threads I have read on this forum wouldnt happen anyway.  I am really just wanting to know if what I have conjured up in my head is even possible or not, and if it is if I could get pointed in the right direction.  So, I am looking to add a view, doesnt really matter what type the concept would be the same for all of them, to appear when receiving or placing a phone call.  You know the one that has the little droid waving at you or a photo, etc.  The only thing is that I would only want like the top 30px to be this view.p  pFor instance, you receive a phone call and at the top of your screen on top of the receiving call window is a TextView with a note about this person i.e.  he stinks.  p  pThe only thing I have been able to come up with so far is that I would have to bring up a layout that was either invisible or gone, but have yet to figure it out as of yet.  p  pAm I barking up the right tree or do I need to find a different tree to sniff.  Any and all help would be appreciated.p  pThanks Brandonp

It works and looks fine, but it feels kind of messy. Surely there is another way to do this, such as making this specific to an alert view, and then making it specific to another. Do you know how I would do this Thanksp

Negative 14062 pI sometimes declare classes in nested namespaces and when it comes to defining their member functions, I prefer not to have to qualify each one with these  nested namespace names, especially if they are longish.p  pAdding using namespace   or, for more precise targetting, using SomeClass  before I define the member functions seems to obviate the need to qualify each definition, but I cant find anywhere in the spec that guarantees this, and Im worried that it might be a behaviour that only works with GCC.  I note that there doesnt appear to be a similar mechanism for skipping the need to add the qualifiers when defining free functions.p  pAs an example of what I meanp  pHeaderp  precode example.h namespace SomeNamespace      class SomeClass          public         void someMemberFunction           void someFreeFunction  codepre  pImplementationp  precode example.cpp include example.h  using namespace SomeNamespace  void SomeClasssomeMemberFunction       OK seems to define SomeNamespaceSomeClasssomeMemberFunction,      even though we didnt qualify it with SomeNamespace   void someFreeFunction       Not what we wanted declares and defines someFreeFunction, not      SomeNamespacesomeFreeFunction quite understandably   int main      SomeClass a     a.someMemberFunction  Ok it is defined above.     SomeNamespacesomeFreeFunction  Undefined     return 0  codepre  pSo my question is the above way of definining SomeClasssomeMemberFunction legal, and where in the spec is this mentioned  If legal, is it advisable It certainly cuts down on clutter p  pMany thanks p

Negative 14062 pIn my opengl app, I am drawing the same polygon approximately 50k times but at different points on the screen. In my current approach, I do the followingp  ul liDraw the polygon once into a display listli lifor each instance of the polygon, push the matrix, translate to that point, scale and rotate appropriate the scaling of each point will be the same, the translation and rotation will not.li ul  pHowever, with 50k polygons, this is 50k push and pops and computations of the correct matrix translations to move to the correct point.p  pA coworker of mine also suggested drawing the entire scene into a buffer and then just drawing the whole buffer with a single translation. The tradeoff here is that we need to keep all of the polygon vertices in memory rather than just the display list, but we wouldnt need to do a pushtranslatescalerotatepop for each vertex.p  pThe first approach is the one we currently have implemented, and I would prefer to see if we can improve that since it would require major changes to do it the second way however, if the second way is much faster, we can always do the rewrite.p  pAre all of these pushpops necessary Is there a faster way to do this And should I be concerned that this many pushpops will degrade performancep

Negative 14062 pIve converted a bunch of DML INSERTUPDATEDELETE queries from Oracle into PostgreSQL and now I need to check whether they produce the same set of rows, i.e. that delete removes the same rows, assuming the oracle and postgresql databases contain the same data initially, update updates the same rows etc. On PostgreSQL side, I can use the returning clause with DML statements, i.e.p  precodeINSERT INTO testid, name VALUES42, foo RETURNING  codepre  pWhats good about the statement above is that I can prepend returning  to any DML statement without knowing the structure or even the name of the table its executed against and just get all rows like its a select statement.p  pHowever, it seems to be not that shiny on the Oracle side. According to the documentation, Oracle 8i the one Im working with supports RETURNING clause, but it has to store the result into variables and there seem to be no obvious way to get all result columns instead of manually specifying the column name.p  pHence, the question is if there is an oracle statement or sequence of statements to emulate PostgreSQL returning  without hardcoding table or column names. In other words, is there a way to write an Oracle function like thisp  precodefnINSERT INTO testid, name VALUES42, foo  codepre  pIt should return the set of rows inserted or modified in the generic case by the SQL statement.p  pUpdate I actually found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1074843isthereanoracleequivalenttosqlserversoutputinserteda very similar questiona for the conversion from SQL server, not PostgreSQL, into Oracle. Still, Id love to hear a more simple answer to that if possible.p

Negative 14062 pI have a database which has some table and every one of them has at least 100000 records.

I am not sure if I will be able to explain my question correctly, so please bear with me.p  pId like to know if there is a free, or inexpensive solution to help visualize or present to someone whats happening in a iOS application. Things like what happens first things initialized, defaults loaded, views drawn etc then what happens when certain things get touched buttons, sliders what happens when certain situations occur. These type of things.p  pSomething like a flowchart, but perhaps cooler with the ability to code snippets, notes, pictures or anything that could help with the visualization. Something like CodeDrawer which  is CC only but for iOS applications. Im hoping someone knows what Im trying to get across here.   p  pcheers Radp

But what I dont understand is how can we make sure that each time a new user log in, heshe will have hisher own database but not others I can keep a codekeypaircode value codeflagcode for each user in codeSharedPreferencecode to check if the database already existed, but then where do I store these databases For codencode users, I would have to store codencode databases, that sounds impractical.p  pSo whats the best way to store my data in this case p

Negative 14062 pI created a button in interface builder.  I defined an IBOutlet and an IBAction in the header file.  I implemented the IBAction method in the .m.

Negative 14062 pI need to write a plugin for an application which is extensible using Python 2.7. It needs to execute a rather complex dynamic algorithm which works on a rectengular matrix of integers. p  pThe default Python installation that comes with that application does not include a numeric library like numpy, so unfortunately I have to implement this using only the Python stdlib.p  pI tried several different approaches to represent the matrix in memoryp  precodevalues  defaultdictint values  [[0 for  in rangewidth] for  in rangeheight] values  [0]  width  height    access like values[jwidth  i] later values  [[0]  width for  in rangeheight] codepre  pThe dict approach is only there for completeness, its actually not very beneficial because every element is accessed.p  pFrom my measurements, the last of those seems the fastest to build and access. However, I am surprised that there is no builtin matrix functionality. From what I have learned about Python so far, if you dont find some obvious functionality in the stdlib, the most likely reason is that you havent looked hard enough. p  pSo I wonder whether this can be optimized even further, for example using the codearraycode module or some other feature that Im not aware of.p

Now my custom error pages are working, which is great.p  pDeveloping locally in Visual Studio development server, Ive found that if I do not have access, I just go straight to the 401 error page. However When I publish the site to an IIS server, if the user doesnt have access they get a strongWindows usernamepassword promptstrong the ugly, small one in XP. This is actually quite handy because it gives people who are logged onto a different domain a chance to enter the correct credentials.p  pAt this stage, when the password prompt comes up, if the user hits strongCancelstrong or strongEscapestrong, they go to the custom 401 page, which tells them how to go about requesting access. IF however they try to enter a username and password, which defaults to the wrong domain and are therefore incorrect credentials, they are shown the strongdefault IIS 401 pagestrong, which Im very keen to avoid. Third scenario  if they enter CORRECT credentials, they are asked 3 times, and then shown the custom error page.p  pSo, users see the custom 401 page if they are authenticated, and the standard IIS one if they are not.p  pHowever, Ive been finding that most people when prompted with a usernamepassword box just enter the usernamepassword without domain  which ends up being incorrect and therefore sending them to the strongnoncustom IIS 401 pagestrong.

Negative 14062 pWe had a little discussion about how to save a newly introduced checkbox value inside our MySQL database. The checkbox can be on or off but sometimes is not shown at all. My idea is to simply save the status to a BOOL NOT NULL field. We then have either 0 or 1. My colleagues then said that wanted to include NULL, so we can see that no choice has been made.p  pI do think however that a BOOL field should never include NULL. You want it to but true or false, not unknown. If you really want to save the extra state of unknown, I would make the field a TINYINT with no selected  0, selected  1 and unknown  2. This could also be an ENUM field.p  pHow do you think about a BOOL field where NULL is possiblep

Negative 14062 pIn my codeweb methodcode, I get an object of some third party C entity class. The entity class is nothing but the codeDataContractcode. This entity class is quite complex and has properties of various types, some properties are collections too. Of course, those linked types are also DataContracts. p  pstrongI want to serialize that DataContract entity into XMLstrong as part of business logic of my web service. strongI cannot use codeDataContractSerializercode directly on the object I receive in the web method simply because the XML schema is altogether different.strong  So the XML generated by DataContractSerializer will not get validated against the schema. p  pI am not able to conclude the approach I should follow for implementation. I could think of following implementation approachesp  ol lipstrongLINQ to XMLstrong  This looks ok but I need to create XML tree i.e. elements or XML representation of the class instance manually for each type of object. Since there are many entity classes and they are linked to each other, I think this is too much of work to write XML elements manually. Besides, ill have to keep modifying the XML Tree as and when the entity class introduces some new property. strongNot only this, the code where I generate XML tree would look little clumsy at least in appearance and would be harder to maintainchange by some other developer in future heshe will have to look at it so closely to understand how that XML is generated.strongpli lipstrongXmlSerializerstrong  I can write my own entity classes that represent the XML structure I want. Now, I need to copy details from incoming object to the object of my own classes. strongSo this is additional work for .NET too when code executes.strong Then I can use codeXmlSerializercode on my object to generate XML. In this case, Ill have to create entity classes and whenever third party entity gets modified, Ill have to just add new property in my class. with XmlElement or XmlAttibute attributes. strongBut people recommend codeDataContractSerializercode over this one and so I dont want to finalize this unless all aspects are clear to me.strongpli lipstrongDataContractSerializerstrong  Again here, Ill have to write my own entity class since I have no control over the third party DataContracts. And I need to copy details from incoming object to the object of my own classes. So this is additional work. However, since DataContractSerializer does not support Xml attributes, Ill have to implement codeIXmlSerializablecode and generate required Xml in codeWriteXmlcode method. strongDataContractSerializer is faster than XmlSerializer, but again Ill have to handle the changes in WriteXml if third party entity changes.strongpli ol  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ul liWhich approach is best in this scenario considering performance tooli liCan you suggest some better approachli liIs codeDataContractSerializercode worth considering because it has better performance over codeXmlSerilaizercode when incoming entity class is subject to changeli liShould LINQ be really used for serialization Or is it really good for things other than querying li liCan XmlSerializer be preferred over LINQ in such cases If yes, whyli ul

Negative 14062 pI have code accessing and setting an NSDictionary many times across multiple threads, like sop  precode BOOLflagForItemNSNumberitemID      ifitemID          return [[itemFlagDict objectForKeyitemID] boolValue]           return NO   codepre  pandp  precode voidsetFlagForItemNSNumberitemID      ifitemID          NSMutableDictionary copy  [itemFlagDict mutableCopy]         [copy setObject[NSNumber numberWithBoolYES] forKeyitemID]         itemFlagDict  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithDictionarycopy]       codepre  pIn the set method, I originally had a NSMutableDictionary  this was changed to the pattern you see now because, doh, NSMutableDictionary isnt threadsafe. My reasoning was to perform the mutation in a copy, and then reassign the codeitemFlagDictcode to capture the update. p  pHowever, occasionally a codeEXCBADACCESScode crash still occurs when accessing the codeitemFlagDictcode, leading me to believe that the dictionary is reassigned WHILE the accessing the codeobjectForKeyitemIDcode. p  pOne other approach I tried was to use codesynchronizeditemFlagDictcode on both the accessor and the setter methods. While this fixed the issue, this code is performance sensitive and synchronizing the accessassignment caused too much performance degradation. p  pSo my question is, are there other patternsmethods I can use to avoid this bad access while not compromising performance If prioritization matters, the execution and not necessarily ironclad accuracy of the accessor method is most important. p  pNote im working with iOS 4 and abovep

Negative 14062 pIm trying to create a small BrickBreaker game. p  pI have a MainActivity.java, BrickBreakerView.java, and a Paddle.java so far.

Negative 14062 pThe requirement is to have an imagegraphic with five or six elements placed around and on top of it in a circular fashion.  The elements are two short text phrases each with updated statistics.  They are to appear on top of the image in the same relative position to the image.  This is because the image itself contains graphics that are related to the statistics that are being shown.p  pThe key is that as this web page is shown at different sizes and on different browsers, the active elements must always be shown in the same position relative to the image itself.  p  pAn example of this type of thing although the actual image and need is quite different would be an image of a clock with that shows the number of shooting stars seen and also the number of earthquakes detected at each even hour position.  The statistics would need to be shown on the clock itself just next to above, below, left, right of the even hour number.  This relationship between the statistics shown and the image needs to be maintained regardless of monitor size, browser, resizing, etc within reason of course.p

Negative 14062 pLets say a have a function which takes in a buffer for something, and may need to allocate the memory to the buffer in the functions scope.

Negative 14062 pIm convinced there is a simple solution for thisp  pWe have an ASP page that uses Ajax for users to browse content.

How do we accomplish this without sending the page into an infinite redirect loopp  pWeve considered other solutions to our problem but this is what we want to accomplish redirecting our .ASP pages to the page where they are included without sending them into a loop.

Negative 14062 pI am new to Android and am about to write an application that allows a user to edit some data offline and then sync it to a master database on a server somewhere when online.p  pI am assuming that in order for the user to be able to work offline, I will need to have a database on the Android device which can be updated via a content provider  database adapter class.p  pMy question is, what are my high level options for authenticating and synchronising my local database with the server database Are there any commonrecommended approaches. I have heard of using RESTful APIs on the Server but I do not know much about them  is this a standard approach.p  pAlso, is there a common approach to how often the sync is done  e.g. periodically immediately upon a change when online.p  pAny help would be much appreciated as this is very much a grey area for me.p

Negative 14062 pWe are a small team two people intending to develop mobile device games. Initially it will be on iOS only, but will be ported to androidwindows phone. Cocos2d seems to be the best open source game engine for now. The problem Im discussing with coworker is whether we should use cocos2diphone objectc or cocos2dx c.p  pWe both have quite some experience with C, and I have played around with objectc for couple months in spare time. It is not that difficult to use objectc, but C is still more preferable. p  pInitially I intend to use cocos2diphone since most online documentsexamples are based on cocos2diphone. After playing around some cocos2dx samples, I feel they are quite similar. Considering we will port the game to android or windows phone, its probably better to use the c based cocos2dx for game engine related code, so it will be easier when porting the game.p  pIf anyone has practical working experience with cocos2dx, could you share your thought or comment Which one will you choose cocos2diphone or cocos2dx Thanks.p
Negative 14062 pI want to set a lower than default CommandTimeout for a specific call to Session.SaveOrUpdatemyentity in NHibernate. Is that possible and if so how to do it p  pIn my code I use the UnitOfWork pattern, so a timeout of a specific unit of work  session would also work fine.p  pBackground for this question I have a web system. In it there is some loggingdebugging information that I want to save, but if the actual db inserts take a long time I rather have the insert fail and return quickly less than 1 sec than take a long time. However, for most other database operations the default command timeout is fine. Right now the Inserts are almost always super quick. However if the database for some reason is slow not something that happens everyday visitors of the site is affected of my slow logging which I would like to avoid. As the info is not critical I had hoped a easy solution would be to just set timeout of the db calls.p

Negative 14062 pIve been working on a basic 3D XNA game. So far Ive managed to load various character models onto a larger levelworld model. Ive put in some basic controls which allows the userplayer to move one of the characters around the world  and even implemented some collision detection using BoundingSphereBoundingBox with other character models.p  pHowever, the character models at the moment are stuck in a fixed place on the Yaxis, and so my world is really just a flat plane for them to glide across.p  pWhat I want to do now is implement a gravity like force, which will allow characters to rise and fall with the flow of the terrain. Ive spent a couple of hours on google searching in vain for some way of checking for a detailed collision between the bounding sphere of my character and the actual mesh of the world. The articles I have found all seem to explain how to use the sphere and box methods, or to implement some external physics engine all of which seem really quite elaborate for what I want to achieve.p  pSo my question is twofold p  ul liFirstly, Am I approaching this in the best way With a single largeish model for my worldli liSecondly, Is there a relatively simple way to check for the type of collision I need, using the XNA library itself, or some other library that doesnt require me to introduce an entirely new layer of physics.li ul  pNB. The models that I want to check for collisions are Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.Modelp  pEDITp  pI should also mention that I am not creating a single level, but a game engine which will work with various levels loaded from a Database. For this reason, I dont want to have to separatelymanually define the constraints of the level. I would ideally like to load my single mesh from the database and be able to detect collisions with it as is, or alternatively automatically work out the constraintsbounding areas from the mesh data.p

Negative 14062 pIve been tasked with rewriting a Java web services client in C.NET. The only truly tedious part of this task has proven to be figuring out how to handle all the Java class libraries sorry if thats not the right termnot nearly as experienced with Java as with C. Im looking at two different optionsp  p1 decompiling the jars and using Sharpen to convertp  p2 decompiling or using online doc from Apache to just recreate the parts that I needp  pThe biggest drawback to these two approaches is the question of whether there are any C analogs to the Java classes that Id be converting, which would mean that Id be duplicating effort. The first option also has the drawback that some of the code might not convert cleanly, leaving it up to me to have to look through all the code to figure it out. The two most important libraries that I need C equivalent code for are the Axis2 AxisFault and Constants libraries and the Axiom OM library.p  pstrongThis is my questionstrong Are there any other options besides the two that Ive listed Ive googled this a dozen times and all that Ive found are those two options.p

Negative 14062 pI am stuck on coming up with a clean design for my problem below. I have contemplated a pubsub or observer pattern, but my problem seems opposite of these approaches unless I am just not thinking correctly. Maybe the Mediator pattern will work, but it still doesnt quite seem right to me for some reason. So, any help in what design is needed here, please let me know p  pMy problem is that I need a handler that can handle events from multiple sources. I need a hotkey manager that can manage events from multiple places. IE. If a keypress is encountered, then some action should happen. Or, if a button is pressed on a microphone different source, then an action should happen. p  pMy current idea is to implement the manager as a singleton not a huge fan of this..., and have classes register in the manager. The classes would need to implement an interface that would guarantee a certain event that the manager would attach to when they were registered. I just dont like this because the class would need to raise this event, which is not something that is guaranteed by the contract per sep

Negative 14062 pI am developing a iOS app like eBay. For this web service developer is using Magento. He developed the web service for Login. Following are the situations p  p1 If I send valid login credentials , he returns me logged in used info in response  a flag as result  true amp in this case http status code is 200.p  p2 If I send wrong password , he returns me a flag as result  false amp  http status code is 200.p  pBasically I dont want to depend on result flag because , if developer changed the result flag name then iOS app cant recognize that. So I want to follow standards which is a http status codes.p  pMy question is , in 2nd situation is it right to send 200 as http status code  I think he should send me 401  Correct me if I am wrong. If I am right , is there any way to send http status code from php code so that I can check the http status code on iOS side p
Negative 14062 pSay I have a list of codeActioncode objects, which corresponds to a Ember model. Each has a few properties timestamps and a codedetailcode attribute, which can can recursively contain more codedetailcodes arbitrarily deep nesting. You can think of the details as nested lists.p  pI want to write a UI that allows easy editing auto completion of values, easy copy and paste, reorder elements, etc of the codedetailcode for any codeActioncode object. p  pRight now, my codeDetailViewcode template will recursively render additional codeDetailViewcodesp  precodeif view.content.hasChildren     each child in view.content.children        DetailView contentBindingchild     each else     EditDetailView contentBindingview.content.value if codepre  pSo each codeDetailsViewcode corresponds to a node in the Details object tree. p  pBut I am unclear how to add controllers to the mix  there is additional state  I need to store  functionality to implement e.g., transforming values from the Detail object for display in the DetailsView handling events for insertingdeletingreordering elements changing the structure of the Details tree that belongs neither in the model nor the view.p  pIdeally I would have a codeDetailsControllercode serving as a proxy a codeDetailscode per codeDetailsViewcode. strongCan I dynamically instantiate controllers and set up their contents within a view templatestrong My understanding of the new Ember Router is to setup controllers and outlets in in a given route however, that doesnt seem to apply here because no routing is being done at all. All suggestions  insight about how to handle recursive controllers  views  routes welcome.p  pIve taken a look at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12602429emberjsnestedviewsandcontrollersEmberJS Nested Views and Controllersa, but that proposes I have a single codeArrayControllercode for all codeDetailcodes, even across codeActioncodes ... this would not preserve the tree structure of the nested details either.p  pIve also looked at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9962647recursiveviewinhandlebarstemplatenotworkingafterupgradingtoember096Recursive view in handlebars template not working after upgrading to Ember 0.9.6a but the solution doesnt say anything about controllers.p
Negative 14062 pI have an entity class userdetails which has the username, userid numeric and password fields, with username and userid forming a composite primary key. This is negotiable, and possibly unimportant to the main problem.p  pI have another class, connectiontable, which has userid as the primary key.

Negative 14062 pI have a project where I implemented many unittests using MOQ which works as expected.p  pNow I have running some selenium integration tests to check the whole application. The Integration test runs within a unittest Project in a testclass. When the application comes to the part, where a external webservice is used, it fails because that service is not available. What is the best option to create a Mock for that servicep  ul lipCan I change the NinjectInjections from the ASP.NET at runtime through the UnitTest process I dont think so.  Details to the setup The IntegrationTest which is a single unittest within a testproject, starts the webserver, then starts selenium to connect on the Server and does some Input. I want now to change a IMyInterface with a mockump from the unittest, without having any if then else in the real ASP.net code.pli lipShould I make conditional bindings in the ASP.NET Injection setup when the test is running But that would mean, that all MOQs should already been added at that point, so I cant addchange it from one test to another.pli lipOr what is the best way for this testingpli ul  pThanksp

Negative 14062 pI need some advice about best practice of developing iOS app designp  pHeres what Im dealing with when iOS device looses internet connection or doesnt have one and figuring that out I want my app to go to some sort of offline mode, i.e. firing some event, sending some NSNotifications, m.b. showing some sort of alert etc. Accordingly, when iOS device gets its connection back I want the oposite thing  move my app to some sort of online mode. p  pSo, what I want is to have ability to access apps mode i.e. to check whether app is online or offline from within some of my ViewControllers. Im thinking of two methods of storing apps statep  p1 Have some AppDelegates property and access it from anywhere via my AppDelegate. AFAIK, thats a wrong approach, because AppDelegate is not supposed to be used as global object for application, but for doing launch initialization and controlling applications state changes.p  p2 Store this information on Model level. But I have no idea what am I supposed to use on Model level for such purpose. I dont think using Core Data or NSUserDefaults is a good idea, because I dont want this property to be persistent, I need it only during current application running. And apart from Core Data and NSUserDefaults I dont actually know any other Model level techniques.p  pI dont include any code examples, because its mostly a theoretical question.p

Negative 14062 pLet me explane the situation a bit. I already wrote a C multithreaded server, where multiple clients can connect to. The server holds a dictionary from all clients. Now each client spawns a new instance of a object called ipPhone. To let my server send to the connected client i use the networkstream.write. that sends to connected client. However a client can have multiple sessions open. those sessions are saved in a dictionary in the object of ipPhone. From these sessions i save the IP and the port.p  pNow i was tinking of doing something like this.p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeforeach KeyValuePairltstring, IpPhoneSessiongt sessionPair in dicIpPhoneSessions      phoneSession  sessionPair.Value     tcpClient  new TcpClient     tcpClient.ConnectsessionPair.ipNumber, sessionPair.portReceiving     if tcpClient.Connected              clientStream  tcpClient.GetStream         clientStream.Writebuffer, 0, buffer.Length         clientStream.Flush       codepre  phowever that doesnt work as it seems that doesnt send to the correct port.

Negative 14062 pIm developing a Java application which is dealing with a huge amount  1.000.000 of keyvaluepairs.

Negative 14062 pwhat is the difference, in using class vs addClassName jscriptp  pin a for loop, whenever I was adding a class to the existing class, then after each loop cycle it was adding new class to it.

Negative 14062 pI hope someone can help me My images are displaying vertically instead of horizontally in FF and Chrome, but displays perfectly horizontally in IE. I know html somewhat, and very little about css properties, so Im having a devil of a time trying to sort this problem out. After months of searching forums, Ive come to the conclusion that the problem Im having has something to do with either width properties, a jquery accordion menu I added to the website, or both. The problem started after I inserted the html and css for the accordion menu.

Negative 14062 pI should preface this question by saying I was QA for several years and I am now learning programming. Im in the middle of learning about Inheritance and there are a few things that just have me plain confused. Im probably missing something completely obvious, but it seems to me there are a lot of things that duplicate work and could be done simpler with proper documentation. A delicate subject to say the least, considering every time I asked for documentation I was more or less lynched.p  pExample from Oracles own documentationp  precodepublic interface OperateCar       constant declarations, if any      method signatures      An enum with values RIGHT, LEFT    int turnDirection direction,             double radius,             double startSpeed,             double endSpeed    int changeLanesDirection direction,                    double startSpeed,                    double endSpeed    int signalTurnDirection direction,                   boolean signalOn    int getRadarFrontdouble distanceToCar,                      double speedOfCar    int getRadarReardouble distanceToCar,                     double speedOfCar          ......     more method signatures  codepre  pYou have interface that sets up a few method signatures, and it is implied in the documentation that most of the methods should accept the variable codedirectioncode with the type of codeDirectioncode. From what I have read, this is to protect the type of data being passed about so you dont send a float to an int and cause bad things. To me there should be a definition in the documentation that says When passing in the direction of a car the values should always be double and in x format.p  pThis isnt the last thing that confuses me, but there are so many forms of loops that all do the same thing. E.g.  p  precodeswitchinVar case1 system.out.printlnOne        Break case2 system.out.printlnTwo        Break  codepre  pversusp  precodewhileigt0     whileigt0 ampamp ilt2system.out.printlnOne     whileigt1 ampamp ilt3system.out.printlnTwo  codepre  pIt appears to me that all loops are really just a complicated codewhilecode loop. So the question I have isp  pWhy are the so many ways to do the same thing Wouldnt having every type expressly determined in the code create a better protection of data An codeifthenelsecode loop may take up half as many lines as a group of codewhilecode loops, but you could explain the same fundamental principles to every person without fear of confusion.p  pOR, do I just have so little experience in the world of programming that my question is naive at bestp

Negative 14062 pIm having a weird issue with numpy right now on a current assignment.

And in Fields table I have, for example, Name, Address, Phone, Operating Systems, Programming, Bike ridding, playing pc games.p  pI decide to create a form with name number 1 Personal info and fields number 1,2,3 Name, Address, Phone. This information is recorded in another table called fullform where its saved form name id and field id. This is pretty clear for me perhaps Iwrong.p  pThe tricky part comes now. Some user decide to fill the personal info form so the name of the form and each field will has to displayed. When the user fill the form it has to be saved some way so the administrator can see the name of the form, each field that that form has, who filled the form and the information written in each field.  And all this should be displayed not only in the DB but in some different way like a table, for example.p  pBy the way... Im using cakephp and mysql.p  pThanks in advance,p  pAbrahamp

I would appreciate anyone who could help me figure out why the nil elements are still present. The code posted there is working code, for me, if you have the Sharpen namespace from the ngit project for Sharpen.AList, which is just a wrapper for Collections.List. Ive been doing a lot of javac lately.p  pThe reason Im interested in this is because I have a large large huge amount of data which is basically some java classes serialized with Jaxb 2.2.7, which I send over TCP to a C client which has analogous classes of the in java. The goal is to unmarshal that data right into the c classes. Unfortunately, I could not find a method in jaxb of naturally creating a universal reference tracker per object serialized, and had to manually write an XmlAdapter for each class I wanted tracked and referred to. It seems that DataContract does this naturally and quite easily. However, the JAXB doesnt put references to null elements in the output xml, and Id like to make sure that the DataContract stuff mimics the same behavior. p  pThank you.p

Negative 14062 pIm new to jQueryMobile and forcing a problem I cannot solve alone.p  pIm having a HTML form, which is very large 100 fields.

If you click on a user you can see the reports for each user which is the listview.p  pOn codedocument.readycode  event Im calling a codeloaduserscode function to retrieve all users and their reports from the database. With these data I build up the collapsible and listviews and at the end I call      code.listviewvisible.listview.listviewrefresh     .menuvisible.collapsiblesetrefreshcode to display the collapsibles and listviews correctly.

But what worked before is ending up in a plain list without the expected styling.p  pCan anyone give me a hint how I can make JQM make my collapsible and listviews display correctlyp

Negative 14062 pIn my multimodule Maven project, suppose I have two modules, codecarcode and codehorsecode. They both depend on a JAR file, codetransport.jarcode, a file not available in any online Maven repositories. As such, I need to find a way to make these modules depend on a file found somewhere in the project folder structure.p  pFrom what I understand, the default Maven solution would be to manually register the JAR file in the local repository. While this would work on a development machine, it breaks on the build server, which clears its local repository before each build.p  pIve been searching online on how to do this on and off for a while and found some helpful things, but nothing that completely works.p  pFor instance, a common answer is to add a dependency to the file using codeltscopegtsystemltscopegtcode. However, not only do others claim that its extremely bad practice to do so, it also doesnt work on the build server. On a side note, I would also like to point out that using absolute paths to the JAR is also out of the question due to, again, it being built on several different machines.p  pA more useful method I found was to define a local repository in the POM file, pointing towards the path codefileproject.basedirlibcode. a hrefhttpsdevcenter.heroku.comarticleslocalmavendependencies relnofollowSuch as in this articlea Unfortunately, if I place the JAR and repository definition in the codecarcode POM, I cannot successfully add a dependency to the JAR in codehorsecode. Ive tried both with and without an additional reference to codecarcode in codehorsecode, as well as defining a second repository in codehorsecode, pointing to codefileproject.basedir..carlibcode. This problem would also remain if I tried to make a third module, codetransportlibcode, specifically for wrapping the JAR dependency.p  pI could most likely add the JAR file to both modules and define two separate modulelocal repositories, but I really dont want to unless I have to due to the need to keep the two often updated JARs in sync etc.p  pSo, my question is as follows Can someone give me a confirmedtowork method to have two modules depend on the same JAR file inside the project, given the parameters and restrictions mentionedp

Negative 14062 pI have a program which uses codegetRedcode, codegetGreencode and codegetBluecode which works fine. Im looking to see if I can find some other algorithms which also color greyscale images, whether it be more or less accurate it doesnt matter, its just something im looking into to compare the methods and their accuracy. I decided to use a similar method, just by using codegetRedcode for image 1, 2 and 3 as opposed to just 1 and dividing by 3 for each colour, in theory achieving the average red, green and blue values across the 3 images and creating a new image from it.p  pThe resulting image is quite strange the colors arent uniform i.e. random colours for each pixel, you can barely make out any characteristics of the image as its so grainy, I suppose is the best way to describe it. It looks like a normal photograph but with colour noise everywhere. Just wondering if anyone knew why this is happening It wasnt my intentions and was expecting much more normal, quite similar to the original method but maybe more subduedbrighter colors for each.p  pAnyone know why this is happening It doesnt seem right.

Negative 14062 pWe had a number of developers working on a large website project using Git.

Negative 14062 pI am newish to Rails and GitHub and struggling with managing two coders development logs. Specificallyp  ol liHow do I merge two developers development logs li liCan I automate their merger Or can I differentiate them in some Railsy or GitHub Flowy wayli ol  pThe Rails app I am developing on command line CentOS 6 is being worked on by another developer. We are using a private GitHub repo to help us manage our codebase and are trying to follow a hrefhttpscottchacon.com20110831githubflow.html relnofollowThe GitHub Flowa. p  pThis strategy works well for almost every aspect of our project. The only major problem Ive run into with this so far is that our development logs are of course out of sync. For instance, he branches from master, then I do. Then he merges to master, then I do, but my merge will fail, citing the automatic merge failure on logdeveloment.log. Our logs will be structured like thisp  pemlogdevelopment.log  mineem  br  Shared Tens of thousands of lines of code from master branch point br  Not    Thousands of lines of code unique to my branchp  pemlogdevelopment.log  hisem br  Shared Tens of thousands of lines of code from master branch point br  Not    Thousands of lines of code unique to his branchp  pSo, I find going through this manually, even with diff tools like codegit mergetoolcode, impractical because of the volumes of code involved. Am I simply too much of a vim novice to be able to put this to good use Do others find this trivialp  ol liIs there a git or rails development strategy we can employ to keep these files without them clashing ex some tinkering with Rails configuration to designate Development1 environment vs. Development2 environmentli liIs there some command line tool that merges two clashing logs based on time last updated Im imaging a tool that, given two clashing gittracked documents can merge them by comparing the branch pointtime, using that as the shared base and adding in the remainder based on which was more recently updated more recent  appended last. A more advanced version would walk back through commit history to append updates based on commit timestamps.li ol

Negative 14062 pI have a list of over 6000 strings, these strings are company names.  Appended to the end of these strings are C,E,B,BE,CCARD,CE,BNOE.  These appended characters can be in any order or not exist at all and have any number of spaces between them seemingly dependent upon how many times the accounts department wanted to jump on the spacebar.  I need to remove these impurities from the string without effecting the company names which obvious may include B, C, BE, etc... and may end in E, C, etc...p  pThe factor which can distinguish C,E,B,BE,CCARD,CE,BNOE existence is that they always have a space which precedes them.

But this seems very basic, is there a better way to do thisp  pExample of stringsp  precodeCOMPANY NAME 26 spaces CCARD  COMPANY NAME 15 spaces CCARD E  COMPANY NAME 5 spaces B E CE CCARD codepre

Negative 14062 pIm beginning to develop games for android and I have what I believe a pretty simple question. Im trying to replicate the game The Impossible Game which is shown below for some practice. Im having trouble with the white line the player uses as the ground. When I want to create it, should I create is as its own texture and draw it like that on a texture atlas map and then put it into my game level picture and use collision detection, or should I just create that line in the background image and say if players position y  number, then stop falling And then scroll the camera upwards when the player goes higher so the line doesnt always stay at that part of the screen. Which is an easier approach hanks guys. Im just not sure whats easier.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4K86X.png altImpossible Gamep

Negative 14062 pTo the best of my knowledge, this algorithm will search correctly and turn out true when it needs too. In class we are talking about Big O analysis so this assignment is to show how the recursive search is faster than an iterative search. The point is to search for a number such that A[i]  i find an index that is the same as the number stored at the index. This algorithm versus an iterative one only varies by about 100 nanoseconds, but sometimes the iterative one is faster. I set up the vector in main using the rand function. I run the two algorithms a million times and record the times. The question I am asking is, is this algorithm as efficient as possible or is there a better way to do itp  precodebool recursiveSearchvectorltintgt ampmyList, int beginning, int end      int mid  beginning  end  2      if myList[beginning]  beginning check if the vector at beginning is                                           equal to the value of beginning         return true           else if beginning  end when this is true, the recursive loop ends.                               when passed into the method end  size  1         return false           else              return recursiveSearchmyList, beginning, mid  recursiveSearchmyList, mid  1, end        codepre  pEdit The list is preordered before being passed in and a check is done in main to make sure that beginning and the end both existp

Negative 14062 pWe are working with Visual Studio 2008 in a solution with 128 projects, almost half of them are unit test projects which make a total number of more than 5000 unit tests. For that reason we usually leave all unit test projects unloaded except those ones we are working with. Nevertheless, we often suffer from having Visual Studio 2008 blocked whenever we try to launch a single unit test or loadunload a different unit test project. In Task Manager we see that devenv.exe process takes constantly 25 of CPU and through Process Explorer we have seen that devenv.exe is in a loop of CreateFile, QueryBasicInformationFile and CloseFile for each project file loaded in the solution, iterating through all project files over and over again.p  pWe have tried to set in the registry the key HKLMSoftwareMicrosoftVisualStudio9.0EnterpriseToolsQualityToolsEnableCMI to 0 as it is stated in some forums where we have searched for a solution or workaround, but with no luck.p  pAs a workaround, we are working with solutions that contain only a small subset of projects, but we dont see it as a definite solution as we dont consider very developerfriendly to be switching between different solutions and different instances of VS2008 all the time.p  pAnyone who had experienced this same behavior could give us any clue on how to prevent Visual Studio 2008 from being unresponsive for so much time when dealing with unit tests It makes developing unit tests almost impossible.p  pMany thanks in advance.p  pJose Antoniop

App engine url fetch has 60 sec limit. I used App engines oauth2 library which uses a different httplib2. So I modified httplib2 source deadline to max 60 sec but it seems to time out after 30 sec.

Negative 14062 pI am working on a large scale project that involves giving a python script a first name and getting back a result as to what kind of gender it belongs to. My current program is written in Java and using Jython to interact with a Python script called sex machine. It works great in most cases and Ive tested it with smaller groups of users. However, when I attempt to test it with a large group of users the program gets about halfway in and then gives me the following errorp  precodeException in thread main SyntaxError No viable alternative to input n, ltstringgt, 1, 22, result  d.getgenderChristinewazonekn codepre  pI am more accustomed to Java and have limited knowledge of Python so at the moment I dont know how to solve this problem. I tried to trim the string that Im giving the getgender method but that didnt help any.

Negative 14062 pI am trying to offer my users a smooth data entry experience even if they walk away from their browser for a while, then come back and find out they have been logged out because the session timed out. p  pIn my case this is particularly important as I am asking my users to enter potentially more than 100 answers to a questionnaire a bit like an income tax form. So it is quite understandable that they cannot respond to all these answers all the time without experiencing a session timeout from time to time. p  pI have been reading up about how to best preserve the data that the user has entered until the timeout happens and have decided to building a solution where the users answers are first stored in session variables and, at the point of session timeout, stored in a database. I also store the filename in the database where the session timeout occurs so I can bring the user back to that place.p  pThis now works. So if the timeouts occurs, the user is asked to log in again and then brought back to the place in the questionnaire where the timeout happened. So far, so good.p  pBut I have my doubts as to the efficiency of my solution. When I look at the session information stored in the cookie on the clients PC i.e. my PC using an XAMMPPHPMySQL setup, I see all the information, that I have just stored in the database, nicely sitting in a cookie. The cookie still remains on the clients PC after the session has timed out.

Because I build a RESTful and stateless API, I didnt want to use a session on the server. So I decide to build it on my own with help of a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebsigninserversideflow relnofollowGoogle SignIn for serverside appsa, but the example there also uses a session.p  pDoes anyone have a solution for a similar problem or some hints for solving my problemp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pBecause OmniAuth doesnt fit well in my setup, I started to create a own implementation for thirdparty OAuth2 login following a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsOAuth2Loginhldevalidatinganidtoken relnofollowGoogles helpa.

Here we have to redirect the user to the signup page, we also can use informations from the oauth provider to prefill in the signup form, but until the user pushes the signup button, we have to save the authentication.li ol  pMy question now is, what is a good practice to save such informations authentication, oauth2 csrftoken serverside in a REST API, without using a session.

But I had to choose M.Alis way because I think OUTPUT was created for this situations and it is more generic solution. Thanks for test code Vladimir. Stackoverflow we need Multiple Accepted Answer p

Negative 14062 pIm not sure if this is possible, but I have a view that is able to be dragged around the screen via pan gestures.  Once the view is selected, little grippers appear on the corners of the view that allow the user to resize the view.  The problem is, those grippers go outside the bounds of the view they still show up, because clipSubviews is off, but gesture recognizers on those grippers are not firing when selecting the part of them that is drawn outside of the view.  Making the view bigger to actually hold the grippers would break a lot of already created logic that is based on the size of the view, so that is a last resort for me.  p  pIs there any other way to get gesture recognizers to work on views that are drawn outside of their parent viewp

Negative 14062 pIm designing a modular web app, that is mainly a web api, with horizontal scalability in mind. My problem is that for some tasks I need two or more modules to exchange data synchronously, but I dont want this to affect the horizontal scalability of my web app. If I could do that asynchronously I would use queues for sure, but with synchronous communication I dont know exactly what to use. Are there some de facto standards or at least some best practices for synchronous communication between web app modules that dont break horizontal scalabilityp  pFWIW, I also coded a demo of this app in PHP, but I plan to migrate to Java soon. However, the solution should be language agnostic.p  pThanksp

Negative 14062 pI am modifying a piece of existing code for my company. We currently have our own custom form which stores its size in the configuration files so that, when the user returns, the window is the same size as it was before. The catch Im noticing is that, after testing with higher DPI settings, the size being stored is the inflated one from the minimum size necessary at that DPI setting. To give an example, I have a login form which is 374 x 243 at 96x96 DPI. When I load the application at 150, the form expands to 695x467, a little less than double the dimensions in either direction. If I change my computer back to 100 on the DPI, the login form stays at 695x467, a much larger display at that DPI.p  pThe code we are using to store the size is as followsp  precode        AppConfig.GetAppConfig.SetFormAttrValueName, LocationX, Location.X         AppConfig.GetAppConfig.SetFormAttrValueName, LocationY, Location.Y          AppConfig.GetAppConfig.SetFormAttrValueName, Width, Size.Width         AppConfig.GetAppConfig.SetFormAttrValueName, Height, Size.Height codepre  pIs there a good property to read to get the nonscaled size of the form My suspicion, based on the nonlinear increase in size from 100 to 150 turning into more of 185 increase, is that this is going to be a tougher nut to crack than Id like Id initially hoped to be able to do transformations based on the codeGraphics.DpiXcode and codeGraphics.DpiYcode objects, but I figured I would ask in case someone knew of an easy answer. Thank you.p

Negative 14062 pSo usually when I make mockup programs like this one I look for things I can improve on in case the situation happens again. p  pToday I thought Id brush up on basic OOP I understand the concept of OOP, just havent messed around with it for a bit and wanted to freshen my memory. So I decided to make a little game that just creates 3 monsters on a 10x10 plane and 1 player you, you are able to move your player in any xy direction. My program works but I cant help but feel that Im doing something incorrectly.p  pSo the basic layout of my program was to have 5 classes. A GUI class that shows the game and gives you directional buttons for movement control, a class that creates the monsters, a class that creates the players, a class that creates the 10x10 board and keeps track of monsterplayer locations, and of course a main class that creates all the objects and has the main game loop and whatnot.p  pI was having a bit of a hard time interacting with my main class and my GUI class. What I ended up doing was doing a while loop in my main class and waiting until the player presses the start button, and once the player presses it via action listener the GUI class sets a public variable running from false to true, and I am able to act accordingly once the variable is changed. p  pHERE is where I feel like I am doing something wrong At first my while loop would not terminate unless I printed out to the console. I Googled the issue and apparently people have said that its some sort of issue with threading or active polling, which I did not understand. I went to my program and added a small 10ms thread sleep in my while loops and everything started working great.p  pMy question to you guys is, what is active polling Why is it bad Howwhywhere was this going on in my program And finally if theres a better way of interacting with a GUI class and a main class. Sorry for the giant wall of text but I like to be thorough when explaining a situationp  pTLDR Am I interacting correctly with my GUI class and my main class If not what is the proper way to do itp  pMy main classp  precodepublic class MainGame   public static void mainString[] args throws InterruptedException     ShowGUI gui  new ShowGUI      whilegui.running         Thread.sleep10           Board gameBoard  new Board     gui.setLabelTextgameBoard.getBoard      Add Player     Player playerOne  new Player1000, Player 1      Add monsters     Monster monstMatt  new Monster1000, Matt     Monster monstJon  new Monster1000, Jon     Monster monstAbaad  new Monster1000, Abaad      whilegui.running         Thread.sleep10          int x, y         x  playerOne.getX         y  playerOne.getY          ifgui.buttonPress  1             ifgui.buttonPress  1                 playerOne.movex, y             else ifgui.buttonPress  2                 playerOne.movex, y             else ifgui.buttonPress  3                 playerOne.movex, y             else ifgui.buttonPress  4                 playerOne.movex, y                          gui.buttonPress  1             gui.setLabelTextgameBoard.getBoard                  codepre  pp  pMy GUI Classp  precodepublic class ShowGUI  private JTextArea board private JButton moveUp private JButton moveDown private JButton moveLeft private JButton moveRight  public boolean running  false public int buttonPress  1  public ShowGUI     System.out.printlnGUI Successfully Loaded     createAndShow   private void createAndShow     JFrame mainFrame  new JFrameBad Game      addComponentsmainFrame.getContentPane      mainFrame.setSize500, 400     mainFrame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     mainFrame.setLocationRelativeTonull     mainFrame.setResizablefalse     mainFrame.setVisibletrue   private void addComponentsContainer pane     pane.setLayoutnull      board  new JTextArea1, JLabel.CENTER     moveUp  new JButtonUp     moveDown  new JButtonDown     moveLeft  new JButtonLeft     moveRight  new JButtonRight      moveUp.setBounds185, 225, 130, 35     moveLeft.setBounds115, 280, 130, 35     moveRight.setBounds255, 280, 130, 35     moveDown.setBounds185, 335, 130, 35      board.setEditablefalse     board.setBounds115, 30, 270, 145     board.setFontnew FontConsolas, Font.BOLD, 12      addActionListeners      pane.addboard     pane.addmoveUp     pane.addmoveRight     pane.addmoveLeft     pane.addmoveDown   private void addActionListeners     moveUp.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              running  true             buttonPress  1                   moveDown.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              buttonPress  2                   moveLeft.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              buttonPress  3                   moveRight.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              buttonPress  4                  public void setLabelTextchar[][] boardToShow     board.setText      forint i  0 i lt boardToShow.length i         forint j  0 j lt boardToShow[i].length j             board.appendboardToShow[i][j]                       board.appendn        codepre  pp  pIf you require my BoardMonsterPlayer classes I can post them, but I dont think the problem is with those classes.p

Negative 14062 pBeing a strongvalue semanticstrong language, codeCcode passes all parameters emby valueem. So when I pass pointer to an object, the object is empassed by referenceem, but the codepointercode itself is empassed by valueem although I believe the object is strongnot  passedstrong at all, only the codepointercode is, and we access the object inside the function emby referenceem. I think this idea  also conform to strongvalue semanticsstrong, since if I thinks like this, strongvalue semanticsstrong becomes more meaningful, emNothing is passed except valueem.p  pSo thinking this way makes sense for codepointercode, as a codepointercode to something is itself an object, which has both codelvaluecode and codervaluecode. While passing a codepointercode as a parameter, a copy of the codervaluecode is sent, like any other object ex. passing an integer.p  pBut what about codereferencecode Theoretically, codereferencecode is not any individual object, id does not have any identity, simply an alias to the object it refers to. Common implementation of codereferencecode may be on top on codepointercode, but what about uncommon implementation Even if implemented in terms of codepointercode, is it passed by valuep

Negative 14062 pI was trying to test the exact type of an object either a costume struct or interface in golang and was trying to figure out how to do it a way that does emnotem real like a cheap hack. Notice that built in types like strings, ints, floats, slices, etc are not what I am asking about.p  pSay that I have a Animal interface that implements a Speak methodp  precodetype Animal interface      Speak string  codepre  pand a Dog struct that implements that interfacep  precodetype Dog struct    func d Dog Speak string      return Woof  codepre  psay I have some variable x, how do I check what struct type it has and act accordinglyp  pFor example I wanted something likep  precodefunc isDogthing Animal bool      if reflect.TypeOfthing  packageName.Dog         return true     else         return false       codepre  pThe only solution that I thought of doing was not really what I wanted to do but I guess it works. First create an empty struct of the type I want to check and then use the reflect package to check for equality. Something likep  precodefunc isDogthing Interface bool      d  Dog     if reflect.TypeOfthing  reflect.TypeOfd         return true     else         return false       codepre  pThe reason I didnt really like that is, say I have a larger code that I need a switch statement eventually. Then, I have to write so much extra code that I feel is unnecessary, like, I need to create the number of many empty struct types as I have cases. It seems unnecessary and really ugly. Is that the only way to do it I also wanted it to be flexible enough to me it check for pointers too. Something likep  precodefunc isDogthing Interface bool      d  Dog     if reflect.TypeOfthing  packageName.Dog         return true     else if reflect.TypeOfthing  packageName.Dog         return true     else         return false       codepre

This observation lead to the next statement p  p4 On most Operating Systems codebadalloccode will be thrown before paging happens, but there is no certain way to tell beforehand.p  pAfter some research I came up with the following thoughts on the above statements  p  pA1 True, the catch block will be reached but maybe not before the OS has performed intensive IO operations due to paging.p  pA2 True, at least not in an OS independent wayp  pA3 True, you have to preallocate memory in order to do something useful with data in the vector gathered so far e.g. do some paging on your own, if you find this usefulp  pA4 True, this is dependent on multiple OSspecific parameters like max amount of RAM per process, process priority, strategy of the OS process scheduler etc ...p  pI am not sure if A1A4 are correct, hence my question, but if so, here is the next statement p  p5 If you need to write some algorithm and be sure that there will be no paging, do not use dynamic data structures like codestdvectorcode. Instead use an Array and make sure it will stay in memory using OSspecific functions like for example codemlockallcode Unix  p  pIf 5 is true it leads to the last statement p  p6 There is no OSindependent way to write a program that will not cause paging.p  pThanks everybody in advance for sharing your thoughts on the above statements.p

Negative 14062 pIn my app I am creating a custom preference screen. This screen in reached via mainActivity launcher. The mainActivity also shows the current status of some of these settings by reading them and laying them on views. Now, when the user will reach one of the preference screens and edit them, by design I aim to bring him back to the mainActivity it would be intuitive to press the back button. This time however I want to show the latest edited settings.p  pI am used to putting layout operations in onCreate. But, in this case onCreate will only be called once when the activity starts and read the status of preference settings and lay them on screen. However, when he will open a settings activity, edit them and press back button he will not see his latest settings laid on screen as onCreate need not be called.p  pSo, on what activity callback should I place the operations to read preferences and lay them on views. p  pThis is based on my understanding and I may have messed up big time. Guide me, Thanks...p

Negative 14062 pIve got a nested tryexcept block in a try, and Id like to raise the error and then break from the method, but it continues on.p  precodetry     stuff     try         do some stuff     except         raise CustomExceptiondebug info     do some more stuff except CustomException     stuff do even more stuff return stuff codepre  pCurrently, after it raises the CustomException line 5, it then jumps to the except line 7 and then continues on and eventually does the return.  Id like it to break when it raises, but not get caught by the except.  It still needs to catch the CustomException if it happens in do some more stuff and continue on.p

But when we iterate through the tasks that we launched in this loop the status of those task remains codePENDINGcode and they are essentially never executed. p  pWhy is thisp

Negative 14062 pI have a myNumber directive that contains a couple of nested ngforms around an input. The input has the ngrequired attribute set to true and a certain ngpattern. The thing is that the state of the input e.g. ngvalidrequired, nginvalidpattern propagates to the ngforms inside the directive. So they get to have the same state as the input itself, which is the wanted behavior. But, once outside the directive itself, the ngform around the directive does not get the state of the ngforms within.p  precodeltngform nameouterForm idouterFormgt     ltmynumber ...gtltmynumbergt ltngformgt codepre  pWhile the input and the ngforms inside directive have a state like ngvalidrequired ngdirty nginvalid nginvalidpattern, the outerForm is ngpristine ngvalid.p  pIs this normal behavior, is this how AngularJS works, or is there a workaround to get the state outside of a directivep

Negative 14062 pI want to serialize JavaScript objects into JSON format and than deserialize them.p  pThe Obvious solution is using codeJSON.stringifycode. The point is that main issue concerning codeJSON.stringifycode is that it is returning error while trying to serialize cyclic objects. The error returned is the followingp  precodeTypeError Converting circular structure to JSON codepre  pSome proposed solution like a hrefhttpsgithub.comdouglascrockfordJSONjsblobmastercycle.js relnofollowcycle.jsa and a hrefhttpspreview.npmjs.compackagecircular relnofollowcircular.jsa can make a workaround in order to be able to serialize and deserialize cyclic objects.p  pOne problem of those solutions is that they do not allow serializing circular objects referencing DOM elements or worst circular objects containing properties pointing to DOM elements. For example, using cycle.js returns p  precodeFailed to read the selectionDirection property from HTMLInputElement The input elements type image does not support selection. codepre  pI thought about detecting the presence of references to a DOM element using codedocument.containsobjNamecode which returns true when the codeobjNamecode object has a reference to an existing element in the DOM tree. If Im able to detect those elements I will mark those references and delete them in order to have a new object able to be serialized using cycle.js and repoint them to the DOM element after deserialization.p  pMy problem is that I dont know in advance whether there is a property of the object pointing to a DOM element or not, when I want to parse all the properties and the properties of properties reccursivly, I wont be able to stop parsing since objects could be cyclic original issue and I will get the following errorp  precodeMaximum call stack size exceeded codepre  pAny cluep

Negative 14062 pIm not sure how to produce my desired outcome using gulp. Unfortunately I dont have any code assembled yet because I just cant seem to get my head around it.p  pMy desired build system is to use gulp to read a dir of layout files and then pass that stream as variables to a template layer that auto generates a navigation for me. For example, if I add a new layoutcontact.html page to my layout dir  my watch task will run the autonav task and src my layout dir, return an array that I can then pass to something like gulputil.template.p  pI think the answer will have something to do with gulputils buffer abilities, but I honestly cant imagine how to put it together.  Appreciate any insight.p  pThanksp

Negative 14062 pRecently, I started looking into building server to handle HTTP requests and user authentication with ASP.NET Web API 2. I aimed at allowing my mobile client, which is built with PhoneGap, to interact with my ASP.NET server.p  pI followed several guides found on the web and these sample projects could be built successfully. However, every tutorial I found always included web pages in the ASP.NET project. I really want to know if it is viable to have my web pages solely stored in the client, so the server can just act as a data provider and authenticator only.p  pHere is a common scenario I can think ofp  precode1. app sends a GET request to retrieve a list of items 2. server receives this GET request 3. server queries the DB and retrieves a list of items 4. server serializes the list as a JSON object and send it back to the app 5. app receives the list of items and updates the page with the new data codepre  pIf the previous architecture is not viable, that means I will need to have web pages included in the server project and be compiled together with the core logic code. Is this statement correctp

Negative 14062 pI recently moved my website from being hosted with cPanel to being hosted on the Google App Engine. Everything has been a much better experience with the GAE but I cant seem to figure out how to view the traffic to my website. With cPanel there were a few apps on the dashboard I could use that would show me the views and the IP addresses and dates associated with each view. With GAE I only see a summary and API requests graphs, which dont really tell me the information I need or I dont know how to read them properly, thats also a possibility. Is there any way to view your website traffic through the GAE dashboardp

Negative 14062 pI am new at c and linked lists.p  pThis code is meant to read letters and numbers as instructions from a command file and execute functions on linked lists accordingly. The command file starts with a r and 1 a read instruction.p  pMy code reads and then carries out the first letter instruction. It then crashes and stops executing the remaining instructions. However, each of the letters work fine if called after the read, so I am not sure if there is an issue with the while loop or the functions  pointer problems most likely.p  pOdd thing is this code worked fine previously and now it keeps getting stuck.

Negative 14062 pCould anyone point me in the direction of how to set a different data adapter for a sub report I just cant seem to find an example  tutorial that uses a different connection.  Essentially Im creating a report based on a JavaBean Collection and I was struggling to iterate a nested collection of objects so I thought I would create a sub report which uses a different javabean collection data adapter set to the ListArray object contained by the javabean object in the main report I hope thats clear.p  pSo for example I may have object Supplier which is passed as a JavaBean collection data adapter to the main report.  The Supplier object has a ListArray member Products List  prods  new ListArray  type thing.  I couldnt get the initial datasource to pick this sub object up so I thought Id create a sub report and point it at the prods List as a different javabean collection data adapter.p  pI seem to be having problems though.  Initially I created the report separately no problems here and tried to add it to the main report.  the report runs fine but I cant work out how to set the connection properties to work when adding it as a subreport though   So instead I tried creating a new report when adding the sub report.  This seems to work but when I go to add the fields Dataset and query dialog, javabeans tab I get a Class Not Found by com.jaspersoft.studio6.0.3.final error.p  pI cant seem to find any examples of how to set the sub reports data adapter   p  pMany thanks if you can help or point me to a relevant tutorial set of documentation.

Negative 14062 pIm working on a custom RSS feed aggregator which parses RSS feeds from various newstype sites, shows a summary and links back to the original site. Nothing terribly exciting. p  pIm trying to get an image for each article as well by using the original pages ogimage meta tag.p  pHowever, Im finding that a lot of the URLs in the ogimage tag return 400, 403 or 404 errors when programatically accessing the images. p  pSome seem to check for a browsers User Agent string in the headers, so for testing only, Ive set my UserAgent string header to that of Safaris this gets some ogimage links working, but it is not an acceptable solution a crawler masquerading as a browser.p  pThis does not work for the majority of images though, which continue to return 400403.p  pAssuming that all the sites Ive tested do not have missing image files and they are proactively preventing anyone other than FacebookTwitter from using those images, is there any other way to reliably and programmatically retrieve images to display in an RSS aggregator p  pFeedly etc al all seem to have images for the vast majority of their aggregated content, so Im not clear as to why Im having such difficulty.p
Negative 14062 pWhat would be the good approach to design following swipe card style app with skip functionality p  pCore functionality of the app Im working on is as follows. p  ul liOn the main page, a user first make a query for the list of the posts. li lilist should be sorted by date in reverse chronological order or some kind of internal score that determines the active post with large number of votes or comments etc li liA each post is shown to user one by one in the form of a card like tinder or jelly style feed. li liFor each card, user can either skip or vote for it. li liwhen user consumes all cards fetched and make query again for next items, skipped or already voted card by the current user should not appear again. li ul  pHere, the point is that a user could have huge number of skipped or voted post since user only can skip or vote for a post on the main page.user can browse these already processed items on hisher profilep  pThe approaches I simply thought about arep  p1.to store the list of skipped or voted post ids for each user in somewhere and use them in the query with nin operator. p  precodedb.posts.find id nin [postid1,...,postid999] .sort date 1  codepre  p2.to embed all the userId of users that voted or skipped the post to an array and query using ne operator p  precode    id postid,   skipOrVoteUser [user1, user2 ...... user999],   date 1429286816366   db.posts.find skipOrVoteUser ne user1 .sort date 1  codepre  p3.Maintaining feedCache for each user and fanout on write.p  pFeedCachep  precode   userId user1,   posts [id1, data .., id2, data ...,.... id3, data ...]  codepre  pOperations  When a user create a post, write copy of the post to all users feed cache in the system. Fetch posts from the users feed cache.  When the user vote or skip a post, delete the post from hisher feed cache.p  pBut since the list of the posts that user skipped or voted is ever growing and could be really large as time goes. Im concern that this query would be too slow with large number of list for nin for approach 1. p  pAlso with approach 2, since all user on the systemor many depending on the filtering could either vote or skip for a post, embedded user array of each post could be really large max with number of all user and performance of the query with ne will be poor. p  pWith approach 3, for every post created, there will be too much write operation and It wont be efficient. p  pWhat would be the good approach to design schema to support this kind of functionality Ive tried come up with good solution and could not think of better solutions. Please help me to solve this problem. Thanksp

Negative 14062 pWere trying to optimize our development process. Our team is working using a kanban process, our goal is to minimize as much as possible our WIP.p  pWe are currently stuck on one issue were trying to get rid of defects as fast as possible, but as normal human developers, bugfixes sometimes get rejected, therefore coming back to the queue and effectively still being emwork in processem.p  pThe way we are currently handling this is by moving back to ticket to the inprogress column of the developer, so that it gets back in the loop and be fixed AFAP, and she decides what to do with it, effectively working on several things at the same time.p  pI dont think this is optimal, and Im wondering if we shouldnt actually reenqueue it into our development ToDo, even if at the top given that we already spent time on it, so that the developer is effectively finishing what she is working on, then switching.

Negative 14062 pI am trying to achieve a clean OOP structure to a problem in Swift. It seems like it should be possible with Swift 1.2 and Apples new embracing of Protocol Oriented Programming.p  pI have a class A that has its own delegate ADelegate. A itself makes calls to methods of ADelegate.p  pTwo subclasses inherit A B and C. B has some delegated methods that only it should be able to call, so it wants its own delegate, BDelegate, which inherits ADelegate and adds a few methods. Similarly, C wants its delegate to be CDelegate, which inherits ADelegate and adds some methods.p  pThe cleanest way to structure this would be give A a property codevar delegate ADelegatecode. Then, somehow, B and C get properties codeoverride var delegate BDelegatecode and codeoverride var delegate CDelegatecode respectively. That way they can both use methods ADelegate exposes as well as their own particular implementations. However, Swift doesnt let me compile that because I cannot override a property and assign it a different type.p  pI know that I can create a different named delegate property on the subclasses so there is no conflict. I also know that I can have the child classes cast the delegate, but that is an expensive operation and not very clean. p  pIt emfeelsem like their should be a protocoloriented way of handling this. To sum up, the goal is to allow subclasses to override properties of superclasses with more specific types. Any ideasp

Negative 14062 pNowadays, Im participating in few competitions in codegolf. For a particular question. Ive submitted an answer in java which contains Nested loops like this.p  precodeforint i0 i lt 200000000 i     forint j0 j lt 1000000 j         declare some variables         do operations         modify variables outside of for loop       codepre  pAssume this takes codencode time.p  pAnother member posted a similar answer but like this.p  precodeforint i0 i lt 200000000 i     nextLooppass necessary args   private void nextLoopnecessary args     forint j0 j lt 1000000 j         declare some variables         do operations         modify variables outside of for loop       codepre  pBut this takes only 60 of codencode time. then I realised it would be related to Garbase collection of the nested loops. The logic of both codes were the same, but seperating the inner loop into a method makes it more faster.

Negative 14062 pAfter some research I couldnt find an answer to my problem, so let me explain.p  pThe user can create an object that can contain text, audio and image, but he doesnt need to add all three. Later on, its possible for it to be edited adding an image to it. That part works like a charm.

If the user edits the object adding an image, this new image only shows up when a new object with an image is created.p  pIn resume tldr version image wont show up if added in edit object mode, it only shows up after new image is added in new object mode. p  pHere is how the image is fetched in new object modep  precodeNSData imageData  UIImageJPEGRepresentationself.image, 0.8f     [self.obj setValueimageData forKeyphoto] codepre  pAnd also in case it didnt have an image, this happenedp  precodeself.image  [info objectForKeyUIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage]     NSData imageData  UIImageJPEGRepresentationself.image, 0.8f      [self.stPhoto setImageself.image]     self.obj.photo  imageData     [self.obj setValueimageData forKeyphoto] codepre  pAnd it is being saved correctly with the context save and all.p  pNow this is how I get the image from core data to show in edit mode in case it has onep  precodeself.image  [[UIImage alloc]initWithDataself.obj.photo] codepre  pNo problem here, just to give more informationp  pNow we get to the troublesome parts.

Negative 14062 pI have an entity class that contains a collection. Client code fetches an entity instance using a repository, and then modifies its internal collection via methods exposed by the entity. At some point, the modified entity is saved by the client code using the repository. Im looking for the right way to keep track of changes made to the collection so that when the modified entity is received by the repository, the latter may know which elements have been addedremoved tofrom the collection. This way, I dont have to do a full collection replace at the database level, but I can use insertdelete operations instead. For example, Im using MongoDB and, instead of replacing the entire array using the codesetcode operator, I would like to use the codepushpullcode operators.p  pOne possibility I thought consists of keeping private collections for saving newdeleted elements. Of course, these collections are implementation details and therefore must not be exposed to client code. However, the repository needs access to these collections. Therefore, I thought about making these collections codepackagecode private but then the repository needs to be located in the same package as the entity class which may not be a good idea Im not sure if putting repository implementations in the same package as entities is a good practice.p  pBest practices Thoughts Another way of doing itp  pThanks, Mickaelp

Thank you allp  precode    import javafx.application.Application     import java.awt.     import javafx.application.Application      public class test extends Canvas           Frame myframe         TextField text         Font myfont         Color textcolor         Color circlecolor           public test              thisSerif, Font.BOLD, 18, Color.white, Color.black                   public testString ff, int fs, int fz, Color bg, Color fg              text  new TextFieldWELCOME TO JAVA             myframe  new FrameExercise1405                   static void drawCircleText          public static void mainString args[]              Chapter14 ctd             ctd  new Chapter14                codepre  p2ND PROGRAMp  precode    import javafx.application.Application     import javafx.scene.Scene     import javafx.scene.control.Button     import javafx.scene.control.TextField     import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane     import javafx.stage.Stage     import javax.xml.soap.Text     import java.util.ArrayList     import java.util.Random          public class Matrix extends Application               Button[][] matrix names the grid of buttons              Override             public void startStage primaryStage                   int SIZE  10                 int length  SIZE                 int width  SIZE          GridPane root  new GridPane           ArrayListltTextFieldgt textFields  new ArrayListltgt         forint y  0 y lt length y                      forint x  0 x lt width x                              Random rand  new Random                 int rand1  rand.nextInt2                   Create a new TextField in each Iteration                 TextField tf  new TextField                 tf.setText  rand1                     Iterate the Index using the loops                 root.setRowIndextf,x                 root.setColumnIndextf,y                  root.getChildren.addtf                                Scene scene  new Sceneroot, 500, 500          primaryStage.setTitleRandom Binary Matrix JavaFX         primaryStage.setScenescene         primaryStage.show           public static void mainString[] args           launchargs        codepre  p3RD PROGRAMp  precode    import javafx.application.Application     import java.util.ArrayList     import java.applet.     import java.awt.     import java.lang.Runnable         public class A extends Applet implements Runnable                      int flag0             public void paintGraphics g                               int x1[]  120, 100, 80                    int y1[]  130, 100, 130                    g.drawPolygon x1,y1, 3                  g.drawOval25,35,150,150face                 g.drawOval55,75,35,25left eye                 g.drawOval110,75,35,25right eye                 g.fillOval65,80,15,15left pupil                 g.fillOval120,80,15,15right pupil                 g.drawArc60,125,80,40,180,180mouth                      public void repaintGraphics g                             ifflag0                             g.drawOval50,50,70,70face             g.drawRect57,75,30,5left eye shut             g.drawRect110,75,30,20right eye              g.drawOval85,100,30,30nose             g.drawArc60,125,80,40,180,180mouth              flag1             try             Thread.sleep1000                                catchException e                                                  run                   else ifflag1                      g.drawOval40,40,120,150face             g.drawOval57,75,30,20left eye             g.drawOval110,75,30,20right eye             g.fillOval68,81,10,10left pupil             g.fillOval121,81,10,10right pupil             g.drawOval85,100,30,30nose             g.drawArc60,125,80,40,180,180mouth              flag0             try             Thread.sleep1000                                catchException e                                                  run                        public void run                      try                 for                                       repaint                                              catchException e                                     codepre
