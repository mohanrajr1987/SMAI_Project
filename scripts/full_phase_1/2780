Positive 2780 pFrom what I understand, localizing Storyboard objects is fairly straightforward you have a file that looks something like thisp  precode Class  NSMenuItem title  Superscript ObjectID  Rqc34cIF  Rqc34cIF.title  Superscript   Class  NSMenuItem title  Select All ObjectID  Ruw6mB2m  Ruw6mB2m.title  Select All   Class  NSTextFieldCell placeholderString  0 ObjectID  RxWoSgX3  RxWoSgX3.placeholderString  0   Class  NSTextFieldCell title  0 ObjectID  RxWoSgX3  RxWoSgX3.title  0   Class  NSMenuItem title  Jump to Selection ObjectID  S0poCmLd  S0poCmLd.title  Jump to Selection   Class  NSButtonCell title  Play ObjectID  qjCb0dMe  qjCb0dMe.title  Play codepre  pand to localize each string, you just replace the text on the right with its localized equivalent. Easy enough. p  pHowever, what if the code is displaying a label or dialog box, where the string is defined in the code For examplep  precodeif dialogOKCancelInvalid Path, text The filepath you selected does not exist, is not a valid sound file, or cannot be accessed by the program.      self.dismissControllerself  codepre  por p  precodelet result  dialogOKCancelDiscard Changes, text Press Cancel to close this window and save your changes to filename, or OK to create a new file. codepre  pI know there are a number of different ways I could do it defining strings at startup according to localization settings detected by the app was one thing I thought of, but Im wondering if theres a correctofficial way to do what Im trying to accomplish, or if not, what the bestmost efficient method is.p

Positive 2780 pI really just need some MYSQL magic, but I will explain a bit more of what I am doingp  pI am building a translation system.

Positive 2780 pI am having trouble using UIScrollView with Autolayout with the resulting layout being able to be localized. p  pIn the normal examples, we are told to embed a contentView of type UIView of into the UIScrollview with its sides pinned to the 4 sides of the scrollview. The contentView must have explicit size, and subviews of this contentView will be pinned and sized accordingly. Easy enough.p  pHowever, this doesnt take into account localization. Apples guidelines for localization state that UILabels and other string holding UIView types should not have an explicit width to account for content length. If UILabel subviews of the contentView are not given explicit widths, then the contentView also cannot have explicit width. How can the need for explicit size in the contentView to make scrollView work be reconciled with the need for flexible sizing for localizationp

IOW, the only players I need them to work with. ughp  pedit2 I went so far as to use MiniHttp to stream the video to Windows Media Player to see if that would fool WMP into playing a video that is being download. Nothing doing. While WMP did open the file it waited until the mpeg file was completely copied before it started playing. How does it knowp  pedit3 After some digging I discovered the problem. I am working with MPEG2 files. The problem is not necessarily with Windows Media Player, but with the Microsoft MPEG2 DirectShow Splitter that WMP uses to open the MPEG2 files that I am trying to play and download at the same time. The Splitter opens the files in nonShared mode. Not so with WMV files. WMP opens them in shared mode and everything works as expected.p

Negative 2780 pI am using libsigc to wire up an application, and is uncertain as to the easier way of going about it. p  pThere is a  preexisting object hierarchy that manages the data layer, and the top level object exposes all functions. All good so far.p  pTo this I am adding a GUI object hierarchy, and in the application object I am hooking them together with signal connections. To make a connection, I need pointers to both sender and receiver.p  pNow, do I hook in a child widget, far down in the tree, directly, thus requiring pointers to be passed up and down the tree p  pOr, do I go through the painstaking processes of hooking in signals and slots at every step in the chainp  pOn the one hand, passing pointers break the separation that the sigslot model buys you. On the other hand, creating connections at every step does not seem to rhyme with the supposed event telepathy that the sigslots are supposed to provide.p  pWhich one would someone experienced with this model consider the default approachp

Negative 2780 pI have some Java code which performs bitwise operations on a BitSet.  I have a list of operations and can interpret them by looping over them, but its important to me that I can perform these operations as quickly as possible, so Ive been trying to dynamically generate code to apply them.  I generate Java source to perform the operations and compile a class implementing those operations using Javassist.p  pUnfortunately, my dynamicallygenerated code runs slower than the interpreted code.  It appears that this is because HotSpot is optimizing the interpreted code but isnt optimizing the compiled code After I run it a few thousand times, my interpreted code runs twice as fast as it did initially, but my compiled code shows no speedup.  Consistent with this hypothesis, my interpreted code is initially slower than the compiled code, but is eventually faster.p  pIm not sure why this is happening.  My guess is that maybe Javassist uses a class loader whose classes HotSpot doesnt touch.

Negative 2780 pWe use a thirdparty product to manage our sports centre membership. We have several membership types eg. junior, student, staff, community and several membership statuses eg. annual, active, inactive, suspended. Unfortunately the product only records a members current membership type and status. Id like to be able to track the way our members type and status have changed over time.p  pAt present, we have access to the products database design. It runs on SQL Server and we regularly run our own SQL queries against the products tables to produce our own tables. We then link our tables to pivottables in Excel to produce charts. So were familiar with database design and SQL. However were stuck as to how to best approach this problem.p  pThe product records a members membership purchases and their start and expiry dates. So we can work back through that data to determine a members type and status at any point in time. For example, if they bought a junior membership on Jan 1, 2007 and it expired on Dec 31, 2007 and then they bought a student membership on Jun 1, 2008, we can see their status went from active to inactive to active on Jan 1, 2008 and Jun 1, 2008, respectively and their type went from junior to student on Jun 1, 2008.p  pEssentially wed like to turn a members type and status properties into a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comap2temporalProperty.htmltemporal propertiesa or a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comap2effectivity.htmleffectivitiesa ala Fowler or some other thing that varies with time.p  pOur question finally   given the above what database table design would you recommend we use to hold this member information. I imagine it would have a column for MemberID so we can key into the existing Member table. It would also need to store a members status and type and the date range they were held for. Wed like to be able to easily write queries against this tables to determine how many members of each type and status we had at a given point in time.p  pUPDATE 20090825 Have been sidetracked and havent had a chance to try out the proposed solutions yet.

Negative 2780 pI am a bit confused. I wrote a Java stand alone app and now I want to use GAE to deploy it on the web and on the way also to learn about GAE. In my application, I read data from file, store it in memory, process it, and then store the results in memory or file.  I understand that now I need to store the results in the GAEs data store, which is fine. So I can run my program independently on my computer, then write the results to file, and then use GAE to upload all the results to the data store, and then users can query it. However, is there a way that I can transfer the entire process into the GAE application so the application reads data from file, do the processing use the memory on the application server and not my computer  needs at least 4GB of RAM, and then when its done might take 12 hours, writes everything to the GAE data store so its an internal offline process that no users are involved.p  pIm a bit confused since Google dont mention anything about memory quota.p  pThanksp

Negative 2780 pIm trying to implement a front end for a reporting solution which is security dependent.  The user has 12 levels of nested criteria to select from, the value of each affects all of the values below.p  pSo the criteria selection on the page each is a dropdown looks something like thisp  pCriteria 1br Criteria 2br ...br Criteria 12  p  pThere is a Security table that holds the values that are available to each user which has the following structurep  pcodeEmployeeID  Criteria1validValue  C2validValue  ...  C12validValuecodebr codex0001       c1                      c2              ...  c12codep  pand each Employee will have one or many more rows in this table. Think of it as a flattened tree, with Criteria1 as the root node.p  pBased on keys, changing Criteria 1 will affect the values that are visible in Criteria 2 through 12.  In the same way, changing the value in Criteria 2 affects the values available in Criteria 3 through Criteria 12.  At each level, there is an option to select All Values, which is represented by a space internally, for lookups.  So I need a representation in the lookup tableview which takes into account that there may be a space at one or many levels.p  pWhere Im struggling is with finding a way to build the lookup viewtable for each Criteria field using sql without having to resort to hardcoding.p  pFor example, to build the lookup for criteria 2 the sql might look like thisp  precodeselect EmployeeID, Criteria1, Criteria2 from Security Union select EmployeeID,  , Criteria2 from Security Union select EmployeeID, Criteria1,   from Security UNION select EmployeeID,  ,   from Security codepre  pAnd so on.  Unfortunately, of course, with 12 levels, the last works out to 212 unions, which frankly smells.p  pIve tried building a table for each level in batch, committing after each, then using the previous table joined to the Security table to build the next with a single UNION in each, but I cant seem to get the joins to work properly with the spaces.p  pI dont know if Im overthinking this or completely missing something, but I feel like there has to be a simpler solution. p  pEDIT This is on Oracle and Im working with an ERP product as the underlying technology.p  pEDIT2 Thanks for the input everyone.  I got the joins eorking correctly using joins like in the example proc from Alex Poole belowp  pcodeand vCriteria1    or Criteria1validValue  vCriteria1codep  pI was missing the codevCriteria1    orcode.p  pSo Ive got the tables loaded correctly enough now.  This is turning into a tuningoptimization exercise. Im going to look at the proc from Alex Poole and the artithmetic approach of JD55 which I think might be very quick.p

Negative 2780 pDoes anyone know how to remove the effect of the bright white spots on the image That is, these spots occur because of the lighting when photographing. As a result, these spots affect the further processing of the image. If you cut a white spot of light from the image, then the results will be very good. This happens if you make a picture at dark place, and because of the cameras flash the resulting image contains white spot. The whole image is dark, but with bright white spot. If you binarize that image the result is bad too. And histogram equalization doesnt help.p  pIt is a program, it must deal with that images with white spot.

Negative 2780 pJust wondering if anyone knows if there are any MSBuild starter kits out there. p  pWhat I mean by starter kits is that from the looks of it most builds to kinda the same sort of steps with minor changes here and there i.e. most builds would run test, coverage, zip up the results, produce a report, deploy etc. Also what most people in general want from a CI build, test build, release build is mostly the same with minor changes here and there.p  pNow dont get me wrong i think that most scripts are fairly different in the end. But I cant help but think that most start out life being fairly similar.p  pHence does anyone know of any starter kits that have like a devCItestrelease build with the common tasks that most people would want that you can just start changing and modifyingp  pCheers Anthonyp
Negative 2780 pI get this error when I try to run my appp  precode20100429 134901.355 MyApp[56123207]  Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSUnknownKeyException, reason [ltMyViewController 0x5112b10gt setValueforUndefinedKey] this class is not key value codingcompliant for  the key toolbar. codepre  pcodeMyViewControllercode used to have an codeIBOutletcode called toolbar that connected to a codeUIToolbarcode object in a nib. I decided I no longer needed the toolbar or the nib so I removed them from the project. But Xcode seems to still want to refer to toolbar.p  pWhere might the reference to toolbar be if I no longer use a nib I can synthesize a dummy toolbar property to appease Xcode, but I want to avoid this kind of ugly hack.p  pstrongEDITstrong Strangely, the exception was not raised when I ran the code on the device rather than the simulator. Also, when I use a trivial nib for codeMyViewControllercode which contained no toolbar, the exception went away. I am using git and when I went back to run previous commits of my code from before codeMyViewControllercode even had a toolbar or a nib, those strangely gave the exception as well. That code used to run fine. I do think this exception has something to do with Xcode and the simulator and some kind of left over state from when I removed the unwanted nib from the project.p

Negative 2780 pI have been writing software for several decades now and these days everything is web.br Before the web we had Client Server apps that were basically thick client applications that spoke directly to the database. They had some disadvantages, such as deployment was cumbersome, Did not scale because DB handled all traffic.  Of course back then distribution of apps was limited to being on a desktop on a corporate network. The benefits to these apps were that they had fewer layers and were quick to develop.p  pThere are times when the requirements call for an app behind a firewall with a dedicated database and a relatively small amount of clients. I suggest sometimes on StackOverflow the old ClientServer type architecture and everybody looks at me like I have 3 legs and 6 arms.p  pWith modern technologies that allow automatic deployments of apps and the tools we have today.

Negative 2780 pIn our ancient Classic ASP environment, we utilize OWASP to get the password from the request object and encrypt nonalphanumeric characters.  This is a first line of defense to preventing sql injection.  We use other methods for full sql injection prevention.p  pThe problem is, when we are collecting data to put together an HTTP post message and just grab the password from the user input, OWASP it and send it along.  The password is therefore incorrect.p  pExample Password freddiecougar becomes freddieamp36cougarp  pWhat we ended up doing was assuming that a 50 character text field was not enough space to do much sql injection and changed the code so we didnt OWASP the password coming in.  This feels a bit scary.p  pIs their a better wayp  pThe code is written in vbScript.p

Negative 2780 pI work for a small data managementwarehousing company that also focuses heavily on web applications.

Negative 2780 pIm in a trouble managing a spinner, so may I ask for your help p  pI have a spinner with its adapter. I initialize the spinner with a list of values when starting my activity. Then I force the selected value to be the one used in the object that I manage.p  pOnce the screen is initialized  When the user selects a value in the spinner, according to the selected value, I may continue or not to another activity for let the user choose a complementary and necessary value. If the user cancels this second activity, I want to rollback the spinner to its previous selected value, and cancel some actions made in the meantime. If the user goes to the end of the second activity, everything is fine and I want juste to refresh the spinner display with the datas selected in the second activity I overload the getView method in the adapter to do this.p  pOverall, I can easily do all of this, however, when I force the selected value in the spinner at the begining of my activity, or whene returning back from the second activity by Cancel, the change value event is catched and the second activity is triggered the user did not click anything at all.p  pHow would you allow the second activity to be lauched only if the change of the selected value in the spinner is due to a manual action from the user, and prevent that same second activity to be launched when the value of spinner is changed in the code p  pI tried many solutions, as setting a boolean into the adapter that tells if the next event will be raised because of an in the code action. Or also putting a boolean in the adapter that tells if the adapter has initialised itself, and I force that boolean to true on the forst change catched event. But nothing that really works fine.p  pThank you for your help.p  pOliverp

Negative 2780 pSorry for the long post, but this forum always asks for use cases .p  pI am frequently called upon to write utility applications GUI and command line for my organization. I most commonly write these in Java and more recently Scala.p  pThe philosophy in Clojure and other Lisps seems to center around the REPL, and I have to agree that it makes a nice development environment, but I obviously cannot produce utilities that require that the users Install Clojure and Clojurecontrib, then unzip the utility into a directory on your hard drive, start Clojure from the command line using the following classpath, .... The users do not care that the utility is written in Clojure. They just want to point and click or, at most, type java jar Utility.jar  on the command line.p  pMy question centers around compilation and separating the application into many namespacesfiles.p  pI know that the codemaincode method must be in a Clojure file that includes the codegenclass...code command or the codegenclasscode clause on the codenscode command. Do I do the same for the additional Clojure files, or should they be left as a source code that is packed in the JAR and loaded by the codemaincode file How about testing the additional files from the REPL during developmentp  pI have been using leiningen, cake, and maven to build selfcontained JARs containing unpacked clojure.jar, clojurecontrib.jar, and commonscli.jar files, but so far I have been writing my code in the same file as the codemaincode method.p

SO, I did mv bashrc .bashrc and that seemed to do the trick AND hid them...but...I still cant type rvm in a new shell...p  pEdit  When I type p  pHOME.rvmscriptsrvmp  pI got a permission denied error, even while root. So I went there, and the rvm file doesnt have executable permissions, for whatever reason... SO I set it to be executable.

Now that the files are in the right place and .bashrc at least already existed, so i just edited it, everything is working perfectlyp

I see the change in the appropriate mutable array.  AOK.  But when I come back to the other tab, the data displayed by BarGraph is the same as before.  After some checking, I found that the BarGraph object had become NULL p  precodeNSLogbarGraph, barGraph  codepre  pgives null.  All my attempts to fix fail.

Negative 2780 pIm running into a deadlock scenario when using MySQL and Hibernate with Spring. Im getting the following exception messagep  blockquote   pcould not get or update next value   SQL[null] nested exception is   org.hibernate.exception.LockAcquisitionException   ...Deadlock found when trying to get   lock try restarting transactionp blockquote  pMy MySQL db has its transaction isolation level configured to READ COMMITTED, and I did some looking into the INNODB status to see what was happening when the deadlock occurred. Essentially I see two transactions where one is trying to select a row from a table while the other is trying to update that row. The table in contention here is my unique id table. I have a common, root object which other Entity objects extend. This root object defines the id property and is annotated with Id, TableGenerator and GeneratedValue.p  pSome digging around led me to believe that setting the LockMode to UPGRADE for the select on that table might help andor changing the select so that instead of it using select .... strongfor updatestrong it would use select .... stronglock in share modestrong.p  pAny ideas if setting the Lockmode.upgrade would really help or changing for update to lock in share mode Secondly, how would I do this with spring  hibernate...I was leaning towards implementing a custom LoadEventListener which would extend the DefaultLoadEventListener.p

Negative 2780 pI maintain a large document archive and I often use bit fields to record the status of my documents during processing or when validating them. My legacy code simply uses static int constants such asp  precodestatic int DOCUMENTSTATUSNOSTATE  0 static int DOCUMENTSTATUSOK  1 static int DOCUMENTSTATUSNOTIFFILE  2 static int DOCUMENTSTATUSNOPDFFILE  4 codepre  pThis makes it pretty easy to indicate the state a document is in, by setting the appropriate flags. For example p  precodestatus  DOCUMENTSTATUSNOTIFFILE  DOCUMENTSTATUSNOPDFFILE codepre  pSince the approach of using static constants is bad practice and because I would like to improve the code, I was looking to use Enums to achieve the same.

Negative 2780 pI have a Rails 3 app where the views are all done in Haml. However, there are some views coming from a required gems that are in ERB, and Haml is adding whitespace, and its messing up textareas and such. If youre not familiar with this aspect of haml, a hrefhttphamllang.comdocsyardocfile.FAQ.htmlqpreserve relnofollowlook herea.p  pId rather not have to convert my layout to ERB, and because the gem is in ERB, all of the traditional Haml whitespace solutions dont help.p  pSo how do I get my textareas and ltpregts etc not to wrap Anything smart I can do in my app is good, otherwise Id be happy to apply a patch to the original gem.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong I think I might have figured out a few decent answers.p  pOne thing that works on the haml end is codeHamlTemplate.options[ugly]  truecode, which eliminates all whitespace. Meh, this might be the best solution, but wheres my whitespace  I liked it, when it wasnt messing up my app.p  pAnother idea was to patch the gem to automatically convert n characters to ampx000A in a beforesave, which mimics what Haml does in the link i linked to in my original question... but that might be a bit of a pain.p  pThe final solution I came up with, which also seems to work, is to create a form.html.haml document that sits right next to the form.html.erb document in the plugin, and is identical. Apparently, the plugin doesnt need to depend on Haml, but if the parent app is rendering Haml, itll look for a haml view before it looks for an ERB view. Theres one caveat, though, and thats that Haml actually needs to be loaded at the beginning of the app. So I have a line at the bottom of application.rb now that just says Haml all by itself.p  pSo for anybody else having this problem, now youve got 3 solutions to pick from, and if youve got a better one, please post itp

Negative 2780 pI run my DAO tests within JUnit test class that has proper ContextConfiguration and RunWith annotations attached. Individual tests put some data to database and check sanity. They are expected to clean up database state after that. There is an easy way  mark methodsclass as Transactional, then methods are executed within a transaction and rollback happens as it should.p  pThe problem is that this approach to DAO testing does not fully simulate the environment. Say, I have some lazyloaded collection field in my JPA entity. In my controller code I get this entity with myDao.getMyEntityid call and iterate over lazy collection. What I get in application runtime is a LazyInitializationException, but this wont happen in my test as it is actually transactional. How do I run my tests with tests not being Transactional, but data still being cleared up on test endp  pI use inmemory HSQLDB for tests if it makes any difference. p

Negative 2780 pI have a requirement wherein I have to buffer a lot of data in GBs, for future use. Since there isnt enough RAM available for buffering such huge amount of data, I decided to go for storing the data in a file.  p  pNow the pitfall here is that while I am writing the data to the file, other threads might need that buffered data and so I have to flush the file stream every time I write something to it. Precisely, the data is video frames that I buffer as prerecorded data like a TiVo and other threads may or may not want to write it at any given point in time, but when they do, they codefreadcode from the file and process the frames.  p  pIn the general case, the codefwritecodecodefflushcode combo takes around 150 us but occasionally and fairly regularly, the combo takes more than 1.5 seconds. I cant afford this as I have to process frames in realtime.  p  pI have many questions here  p  ol lipIs my approach of buffering data in the file correct What alternatives do I have  pli lipAny idea why the fwritefflush operation suddenly takes more time on some occasions Note that it reverts back to 150 us after taking 1.5 seconds once.  pli ol

Negative 2780 pIve been suggested to use Mappers to separate object storage in db from real object behaviour, which sounds like a nice idea.

However, I need to do some transformation to a text file to convert it into a proper xml file. To do this, I use a python script.p  pWhat I need I am working to make as easy as possible the use of the app, but this gets kind of destroyed when the user has to execute a terminal script before anything. I need a graphical IDE for python, but I just dont have time to learn how to make one, and I would love that the entire app would work within the same web environment, much more intuitive for the user. Then, a really easy way to do that would be to use Firefox as the IDE, for example choosing the file to be transformed through it, and launching from there the python script.p  pWhat I require I need compatibility only with Firefox. But of course any system capable to install Python and Firefox should work as well. The user would happily install both programs, as long as they have interest in the app.p  pWhat I dont know Is that possible, to execute an external python script If not, for security reasons I imagine, is there any way for the user to allow it Maybe through the installation of a pluginp  ul limaybe a hrefhttpmozex.mozdev.org relnofollowhttpmozex.mozdev.orga is what I am looking forli ul  pThanksp  pGerardp

Negative 2780 pWere using polymorphic associations in our application. Weve run into the classic problem we encountered an invalid foreign key reference, and we cant create a foreign key constraint, because its a polymorphic association.p  pThat said, Ive done a lot of research on this. I know the downsides of using polymorphic associations, and the upsides. But I found what seems to be a decent solutionp  pstronga hrefhttpblog.metaminded.com20101125stablepolymorphicforeignkeyrelationsinrailswithpostgresqlhttpblog.metaminded.com20101125stablepolymorphicforeignkeyrelationsinrailswithpostgresqlastrongp  pThis is nice, because you get the best of both worlds. My concern is the data duplication. I dont have a deep enough knowledge of postgresql to completely understand the cost of this solution.p  pWhat are your thoughts Should this solution be completely avoided Or is it a good solutionp  pThe only alternative, in my opinion, is to create a foreign key for each association type. But then you run into validating that only one association exists. Its a pick your poison situation. Polymorphic associations clearly describe intent, and also make this scenario impossible. In my opinion that is the most important. The database foreign key constraint is a behind the scenes feature, and altering intent to work with database limitations feels wrong to me. This is why Id like to use the above solution, assuming there is not a glaring avoid with it.p

Negative 2780 pI am placing [OK] and [Cancel] buttons horizontally in a Box which has BoxLayout. Later I add this Box to BorderLayout.PAGEEND in content pane of JDialog. This works perfect in Windows, so [OK] is to left of [Cancel]  just like I have added.p  pWhen I test in Linux, the placement of buttons is same as Windows  [OK] to left of [Cancel]. This, again, follows from code. p  pHowever, in Linux Ubuntu, the default placement for buttons is [Cancel] to left of [OK]. This contrasts with my code and placement of buttons.p  pSo, my question is  Whether Java has some kind of constant  say OSPLACEMENT, which can be set somewhere which will make [Cancel] button appear to left of [OK] in Linux I am asking this because I know Java supports constants for RTL and LTR layout.

Then server asks the storage for a batch. Storage returns an object or null if no batch is currently available. If batch is  non null  everything work well, but if batch is not available the server should return it to the client when a batch will be added to the storage. Therefore Im registering StorageListener which is invoked when a batch is added to the storage note batches are added to the storage from a separated thread storagewritingthread. StorageListener sends upstream using the old request object, pipeline processes it well and my handler writes the response batch to the channel. Looks like everything is ok, but all these tasks are processed in storagewritingthread thread. How can I update the listener to process my handler in nettys worker thread in this casep

Negative 2780 pGood day,p  pI am writing an Open GL App on Android. I have 100 game objects that execute just fine when I update their position, velocity or acceleration. In my game loop, I also want to be able to call a yaw or pitch, or roll method every iteration of the update for the game object. The problem is that I am causing the the garbage collector to go crazy with GCCONCURRENT printout statements to the LogCat.p  pIn my yaw method, I have the following calls...p  precodereAlignVectors No heap allocations in this method that I wrote Matrix.rotateMrotationArray,0,angle,0,1,0 RotationArray is a float[16] Matrix.setIdentityMrotationalComputeArray,0 Another float[16] Matrix.rotateMrotationalComputeArray,0,angle,upVector.x, upvector.y, upvector.z Matrix.multiplyMVlookvector... Matrix.multiplyMVrightvector.. codepre  pIve commented out the code where I would call the yaw method and I have almost no calls to the garbage collector GC, and 100 objects easily move through out the world with out noticable difference. When I uncomment out the yaw call, I get significant decrease in performance. The objects move choppy and I get all the GC calls.p  pDoes anyone know if the Matrix.multiplyMV or Matrix.rotateM reallocate memory in the heap That seams to be the only thing that I could guess If so, does anyone know a way to prevent that or fix the situation I am inp  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 2780 pI know of at least two bytecode enhancer that modify the object model at runtime to allow transaction to be performed transparently. One of them is part of Versant VOD, which I use at work every day, and the other is part of Terracotta. There are probably quite a few others, for example in ORM, but Versant takes care of that at my company.p  pMy question is, is there such an opensource API that can be used on its own, independent of the product that it was designed for You could say an hackable API. It should only track emchangesem, not read access, which would slow down the code significantly. In other words, it should not require explicit readwrite locking. This requires either access to all classes that perform changes, not just to the data model, or it requires to keep some form of previous version in memory to do a comparison.p  pThe problem that Im trying to solve is that I have large 32K to 256K object graphs that are serialized in a NoSQL DB. They are longlived and must be reserialized regularly to have an history of the changes. But they are rather expensive to serialize, and most changes are minor.p  pI could serialize them fully each time and run a binary diff on the stream, but that sounds very CPU intensive. A better solution would be an API that modify write operations on the model to protocol the changes, so that after the initial image is stored, only the protocol need to be stored.p  pIve found some questions talking about Apache Commons Beanutils to compare objects, but that is not useful for inplace changes I would need to make a complete clone of the model between every business transaction.p  pTo reiterate, Im looking for an inmemory API, within the same JVM, which does not involve any external server application. APIs involving native code are OK if they are available on Win, Mac amp Linux. The API does not have to be currently empackagedem independently it just has to be possible to extract it from the parent project to form an independent API the parent project license must allow this.p  pMy object graphs will involve many large arrays, and so that needs to be supported efficiently.p  pThe changes are not desired only for auditing, but so that they can be replayed, or undone. More precisely, with the deserialized initial graph, and a list of changes, I should arrive at an identical end graph. Also, starting with the end graph, it should be possible to go back to the initial graph by applying the changes in reverse. This uses exactly the same functionality, but requires the change protocol to keep the old value in addition to the new value.p  pThe API license should be compatible with commercial use.p  p[EDIT] So far I did not get a emusefulem answer, and it does not seem like what I want exists. That leaves me with only one option make it happen.

Whilst a client will only have one date of birth, gender, and P ID, they may have multiple ethnicities as a result of data quality and also client groups this is more legitimate as a clients needs may change.  However, for these particular items, I am only interested in the most recently added ethnicities or client groups.  Below I have written a query which assigns a row number to the ethnicity and to the client group with a plan to return only those which equal 1, as these generally will be the most recent.  However, I have run into 2 issues, one of which I can resolve, the other of which Im not so sure.p  pFirst off, some clients will not have an ethnicity or a client group recorded.  When running the below query, they return with very odd row numbers often in the thousands.  However, I know in my where that I could specify that a row is returned if client group or ethnicity was empty as these will be data quality cases which need to be addressed.p  pThe second issue is slightly trickier which I will try to represent with a table below.  Please note I have abbreviated the table for ease of input and understanding.p  precode  P ID Ethnicity   PCG RN E RN P   P1   WB          OV  1    2    P1   WI          OV  2    1           codepre  pThe above client had two ethnicities, though WB is the most recent therefore the 1 in Row Number E is correct. However, the client has only had one PCG recorded but the row number returns a 2 in the first row arguably the row I want to return.  Im not sure why though I guess because ETHNIC.CLASUBJECTID is joined on OPERSONS.PERID and PERID occurs twice, that is why it thinks there is two rows for that particular field.  However, even if that is the case, is there a way to force just 1s to appear in one row  Or could I do this a completely different way  Hopefully this query makes some sense, apologies if parts are unclear.

Negative 2780 pI have a Service which needs to be bound because the callers need some feedback and return values. There are at least one Activity, one Fragment and one ContentProvider which should use the bound Service. So alle the using objects call bindService. And all receive onServiceConnected. No problem so far, this works.p  pBut then The Activity wants all the Fragments to show their content, and they call the ContentProvider. And it happens, that the Fragments and the CP are emnotem bound yet. So I cant be sure, that during onServiceConnected all the other Serviceusing objects are connected. p  pHow to solve this Some ideas come to my mindp  ul lipIs there a way to control the sequence of the objects receiving the onServiceConnected callbackpli lipis there a Activity lifecycle callback where I can be sure that all onServiceConnected calls are done So, is there a better way to start filling the Fragments content Or maybe, if I post a message in the Activitys onServiceConnected, can I be sure that this message is processed after all other onServiceConnectedcallspli lipAnother idea was that I save the bound service connection in a static single field somewhere else. Because the ContentProvider needs access, I thought of the Service class itself. But somehow this seems to go against the idea of a bound servicepli ul  pAny other ideasp  pThanx, Joergp

The QPixmap is set to stretch accordingly and the QFrame around pages naturally adjusts its size.   p  pWhen I call for a zoom, pages QLabels are resized one by one with codeQLabel.setFixedSizecode. The effect however is emdisappointingem resizing the document looks rickety and flickery. Zooming in Evince or Mendeley is really smooth in comparison.p  pI have read elsewhere that calling codeQFrame.hidecode before scaling and codeQFrame.showcode after helps. Indeed it does for a small document. However, applied to a PDF of about 700 pages for instance, means a emblankem QScrollArea for more than a second. Not good.p  h2How can I scale the document in the QScrollArea and produce a smooth zoom effecth2  pstrongPSstrong The images of the Poppler.Pages are drawn for the visible QLabel recipients only. i.e. resizing a document of 700 pages does not involve resizing as many images. It will in fact resize 2 to 4 images at the maximum and the more, the less the resolution. Resizing the Document object then consists merely in resizing QLabels, for the most part empty. p

The button pairs in the table are two buttons inside a td.  Ive tried putting a div inside the td with the buttons inside of the div as well.p  pAs you can see, the left down arrow button of the button pairs inside the table does not expand to the height of the container the td in its case while it does in the case of the div.p  pI have Firebug and looking at all of the Computed attributes even when viewing the Mozilla specific attributes for both the corresponding button as well as the container, I dont see any difference other than the height of the one button.  But nothing is explicitly setting the height of the right button next to the hi button.p  pThe view of the page is the same from Chrome as well.p  pI assume the difference in the height is due to the fact that one is a div and one is a td.  But it should be possible, I thought, to get the browser to render the two elements the same.  I cant find the magic css to do that.

Negative 2780 pSimple question I built a quasiprocessor simulator that takes a precedence graph, determines priorities and ready instructions, schedules the tasks on available functional units, etc.  Pretty much a very basic simulator.  p  pBut I realized I should have built it on top of a DES engine, as I have no capacity other than setting a flag and checking every node on every clock tick for saying things like In 10 cycles, do this i.e. raising signals at predefined times and handling events that are supposed to happen in the future or when predetermined criteria have been met.  p  pI could obviously implement this myself built an event class, stick them on a queue, and at the end or beginning of every cycle, check the queue and see whats on there, but I figure theres no point in reinventing the wheel.p  pSo complex network simulators are obviously WAY overkill.  I dont need fancy modeling, or queuing or anything like that.  All I need is a built in clock, and the ability to set events to happen, raise flags when things happen, etc, as I described above.p  pFreeware and C would be great.p  pAnyone have any ideas  The closest Ive come  thanks to some other somewhat related questions  is something called SIMLIB.p  pThank you so muchp

It also creates a label which displays a quote. Whenever a button is selected, the text in the label is set to the corresponding quote. I understand this code just fine. I run into trouble trying to modify it. Lets say I want to create the same program, but with the radio buttons stacked vertically on top of one another. Lets also say that I decide to go about this by adding the radio buttons to a panel with a BoxLayout, which I define in its own BoxPanel class. I would then add the BoxPanel to my QuoteOptionsPanel, which would still contain my quote JLabel. So my BoxPanel code might look something like thisp  precodeimport java.awt. import javax.swing.  public class BoxPanel extends JPanel      private JRadioButton comedy, philosophy, carpentry     public BoxPanel              setLayout new BoxLayout this, BoxLayout.YAXIS         setBackground Color.green          comedy  new JRadioButton Comedy, true     comedy.setBackground Color.green     philosophy  new JRadioButton Philosophy     philosophy.setBackground Color.green     carpentry  new JRadioButton Carpentry     carpentry.setBackground Color.green      ButtonGroup group  new ButtonGroup     group.add comedy     group.add philosophy     group.add carpentry      QuoteListener listener  new QuoteListener     comedy.addActionListener listener     philosophy.addActionListener listener     carpentry.addActionListener listener                 Represents the listener for all radio buttons.          private class QuoteListener implements ActionListener                        Sets the text of the label depending on which radio          button was pressed.                  public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event                      Object source  event.getSource              I do not know what to do here.                codepre  pSo as you can see, I did not know how to define my QuoteListener class. I want it to perform the same function as in the original program I posted, but am unsure of how to make it do so. The label which displays the quote is located in QuoteOptionsPanel, so I do not have access to it. In essence I am asking for the optimal way to change a label on one panel with an event listener belonging to a component on a different panel. I would be immensely grateful for any help you may be able to provide. Please let me know if I have not expressed my question clearly enough.p

Negative 2780 pIve noticed that the instruction set has an LSL logical left shift, which does r ltlt 1 left shifts the register by 1. Id like to be able to left shift by an arbitrary number. Do I need to do this in a loop, or is there a single instruction that would do this for mep  pI imagine the reason for only shifting 1 bit is so that the carry is always OK, but in my case I will bit shifting 8 bit unsigned numbers a maximum of 8 bits to the left, to get unsigned 16 bit numbers... so I think I should be OKp  pThanks,p  pz.p  pps full disclosure Im a student, but this is a small part of an assignment.

Negative 2780 pCan a Bool field become a unique index and used for a foreign key relationship in conjunction with another tables indexp  pI dont think it can become primary key but what about unique index Every time I try to make it into a unique index it converts it into a tinyint.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo I have a SQL relationship problem. Lets say I have a database where I want to keep records of information about individuals. Now I have setup a table to take on that information. Okay so far so good.p  pOften times duplicate information can be discovered in the table and it would be removed. A record is considered a duplicate if a particular field has the same value as another field in another row. Example Duplicate emails.p  pNow I want to create another table in the database to keep track of every duplicate that is ever discovered and deleted. My first thought into this was to create a Foreign Key relationship. So I created and then connected a dupes table to my persons table. The relationship was a simple Foreign to Primary key relationship with an on delete constraint.p  pNow while that may have worked at first the problem arose that the dupes table was receiving records that were deleted even if they were not deleted because they were dupes. This was a problem because even if I decided to delete a person from the persons table just because I did not like them, they would stored in the dupes table anyway.p  pThen I thought, why not create a disposition field in the persons table and connect that as a unique or primary key to my dupes tables index foreign key. Well the problem is a unique key must have a unique value so multiple dispositions of dupe or I dont like you would not work. The other option was to make the disposition field a primary key. That has the same problem though.p  pWhat would be the right relationship for this problemp
Negative 2780 pMost would suggest using one of the many XML editors to create a customized RDLC XML, according to user selections, and passing that report to Microsofts Report Viewer object. I currently implement this method in previous version of my code. However, it is messy, long and lacks eloquence to say the least. p  pPrevious research, I cant remember exactly where I saw it, has led me to believe there is a method to create a dataset, dynamically through code, create an adapter to fill the dataset, and then have that dataset.writeXML to produce a fully functional copy of XML that can be passed to the Microsoft Report Viewer object. p  pAgain to clarify, I do not want to use XML classes to write my report up. I want to build my dataset through code depending on user selection, have the dataset write out the XML and then pass that to the Reporting object. p  pA lot of the stuff Ive found favors ASP.NET for some reason and I have yet to fully verse myself in its workings. If anyone has direction on this it would be highly appreciated. p  pThanks.p

Negative 2780 pIm writing a program that contains multiple JTextFields and 2 JTextAreas within an input panel.  I have a submit button on the bottom.  I have it set up so when a user types something into each field including the JTextAreas and hits the Enter key, it updates a text file, and when they press the submit button it updates the file then outputs a new version of it in the local directory.p  pIf the user presses Enter in any of the fields, it validates their input, however, I want to revalidate all fields when they press the submit button.  Each field again, JTextAreas included has its own validation check within its ActionListener or KeyListener for the JTextAreas.  Its easy enough to use postActionEvent for the JTextFields, but strongis there a similar method for the JTextAreas to force fire a KeyEventstrong  I dont want to duplicate code and consume memory by rewriting the validation for those 2 Components inside the ActionEvent for the JButton.p  pUnfortunately, I cant provide a sample because Im writing the program on a classified machine PC.p

Negative 2780 pSometimes we use third party code. But the repositories of these codes are not accessible to us, which means they are only released in a tarball.

Allocated per thread, if a full scan is needed. readbuffersize1M readrndbuffersize4M   This buffer is allocated when MySQL needs to rebuild the index in  REPAIR, OPTIMZE, ALTER table statements as well as in LOAD DATA INFILE  into an empty table. It is allocated per thread so be careful with  large settings. sortbuffersize1M   INNODB Specific options   innodbdatahomedir0.0   Use this option if you have a MySQL server with InnoDB support enabled  but you do not plan to use it. This will save memory and disk space  and speed up some things.  skipinnodb   Additional memory pool that is used by InnoDB to store metadata  information.  If InnoDB requires more memory for this purpose it will  start to allocate it from the OS.  As this is fast enough on most  recent operating systems, you normally do not need to change this  value. SHOW INNODB STATUS will display the current amount used. innodbadditionalmempoolsize64M   If set to 1, InnoDB will flush fsync the transaction logs to the  disk at each commit, which offers full ACID behavior. If you are  willing to compromise this safety, and you are running small  transactions, you may set this to 0 or 2 to reduce disk IO to the  logs. Value 0 means that the log is only written to the log file and  the log file flushed to disk approximately once per second. Value 2  means the log is written to the log file at each commit, but the log  file is only flushed to disk approximately once per second. innodbflushlogattrxcommit1   The size of the buffer InnoDB uses for buffering log data. As soon as  it is full, InnoDB will have to flush it to disk. As it is flushed  once per second anyway, it does not make sense to have it very large  even with long transactions. innodblogbuffersize8M   InnoDB, unlike MyISAM, uses a buffer pool to cache both indexes and  row data. The bigger you set this the less disk IO is needed to  access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this  parameter up to 80 of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it  too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may  cause paging in the operating system.  Note that on 32bit systems you  might be limited to 23.5G of user level memory per process, so do not  set it too high. innodbbufferpoolsize512M   Size of each log file in a log group. You should set the combined size  of log files to about 25100 of your buffer pool size to avoid  unneeded buffer pool flush activity on log file overwrite.

Lets say that i want to load some of the data answered by the idp, into the fields name of the loginform of my page.p  precodeclass Logindjango.forms.SelfHandlingForm     def initself, args, kwargs         superLogin, self.initargs, kwargs         response  self.getIdPResponse         self.fields[name].widgetforms.TextInputattrsvalue response[name]       def getIdPResponseself         global response         response  None         timeout  300         class RequestHandlerBaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler             def doPOSTself                 global response                 self.sendresponse200                 self.sendheaderContenttype, texthtml                 self.endheaders                 varLen  intself.headers[ContentLength]                 response  urlparse.parseqsself.rfile.readvarLen                 response  self.rfile.readvarLen                  self.wfile.writeLogin ok now you can close this page.         httpd  BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer0.0.0.0, 8080, RequestHandler         try             httpd.socket.settimeout1         except BaseException as e             print e         count  0         at this point, the IdP page is already showed to the user          while response is None and count lt timeout            try                httpd.handlerequest                count  count  1                print waiting for the Idp answer...            except Exception as e                print e         return response codepre  pin this way, when an user successfully logsin, all the user that are waiting to login, will show in the field name the name of the user that first logged in. Obviously I dont want this.p

Negative 2780 pIm looking for a Reportlab wrapper which does the heavy lifting for me.  I found a hrefhttpsgithub.commatthiaskpdfdocument relnofollowthisa one, which looks promising. p  pIt looks cumbersome to me to deal with the lowlevel api of Reportlab especially positioning of elements, etc and a library should facilitate at least this part.p  pMy code for creating .pdfs is currently a maintain hell which consists of positioning elements, taking care which things should stick together, and logic to deal with varying length of input strings. p  pFor example while creating pdf invoices, I have to give the user the ability to adjust the distance between two paragraphs. Currently I grab this info from the UI and then recalculate the position of paragraph A and B based upon the input. p  pBesides that I look for a wrapper to help me with this, it would be great if someone could point me to  provide a bestpractice example on how to deal with positioning of elements, varying lengh of input strings etc. p

Negative 2780 pI am starting my first Facebook app, hosted on Heroku. I have set up an app on Heroku for production and a separate app running locally on my own machine for development. Currently, the app which has very little functionality runs on localhost just fine. But I dont understand if the app should be able to run like a typical canvas app on the localhost with Facebook functionality. For example, will the Requests Dialog run in a canvas app locally. Should I be able to use that functionality locally as I develop If so, what steps do I need to take to get that workingp

It may also have ID, AUTHOR and TITLEp  precode   public class vmTest        public Book MyBook  get set      codepre  pIf I only wished to access ID and TITLE then if my theory is correct then the ABSTRACT column will not be loaded into RAM and therefore cause no performance issues.p  pMany thanks in advance for any help.p
Negative 2780 pI have a programm that calls codestdasynccode many many times.  The tasks that are executed are reasonable short like a few hundred miliseconds each.  I figure that there is significant overhead for thread creation and I wonder if I can avoid this somehow.  The code that enumerates the jobs runs much faster than the processing of the jobs.  Therefore I already have a sort of pooling in place.  It goes like this.  I create an array of job slotsp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt struct job    stdfuture ltvoidgt fut   stdvector ltTgt result   bool inUse  codepre  pBefore the parallel code starts, I initialize the array of job slots, creating the result vectors only once.  Then everytime the job enumeration code has enumerated a job, it looks for a job slot that is not in use.  If there is a free slot, it will start with stdasync a new job, move the future to the slot.  The job runs and fills the result vector.  If there is no free slot, then the code checks if any of the futures in the slots is ready.  If so, it processes the result vector, and then uses that slot.  If not, it waits a few miliseconds.  This code runs very nicely, and scales exactly to the number of processors available.  I learned that each call to codestdasynccode creates a new thread, and indeed, I can see the process IDs scrolling through.  I want to remove this overhead, creating the threads once and for all in the beginning.  How to proceedp  pI have found this threadpool implementation  a hrefhttpscode.google.compcppthreadpooldownloadslist relnofollowhttpscode.google.compcppthreadpooldownloadslista but it states that a task should take one or two seconds for this to be efficient.  I dont need any fancy scheduling, priorities, etc.  I just want to remove overhead for repeated construction and destruction of threads.p

Negative 2780 pIs possible in Visual Studio 2012 to find all classes or others sources which depends from a given referenced assembly at design time  How p  pSuppose, you think an assembly can be removed and a little refactoring or change could supply its absence, so you could just remove the assembly and try to work on the compiler errors. But if we need only analyse the impacts from removing some individual assemblies, or just to know which sources files depend on it, this work isnt better approached capturing compiler errors from each scenario removing and readding each assembly. So, is in Visual Studio a way to see that like others dependencies analyse already supported p

I tried removing the wild card from the parameter, but it still gives me the error.p  pSince tblReport is the same table and database I successfully update in the first query, why does it fail on the secondp

Negative 2780 pIm currently working on exporting a .DLL library file in C in Visual Studio 2010 to LabVIEW 2012. The class does a color transform from RGB to HSL values, and Ive been successful in implementing Constructor and Invoke nodes in the LabVIEW project to call the .DLL file.p  pSo far I can input numbers for the RGB values into the Invoke node, but Im having trouble getting HSL output values the option doesnt appear in the dropdown box for the node.p  pIm relatively fresh to C and programming in general and I think Ive spotted where the input function is in the .DLL, but as for the output function Ive no clue how to generate it, much less in such a way that LabVIEW can export it cleanly. I figure if I can input values, I should be able to get those HSL outputs as well.p  pBelow is the C code snippet in question. The rest of the class is the formula for the transform itself, so I dont think its too relevant.p  precodepublic class QuickColorTransform      byte R     byte G     byte B      byte H      public byte H              get  return H          set  H  value           byte S      public byte S              get  return S          set  S  value           byte L      public byte L              get  return L          set  L  value            public QuickColorTransform              SetupLookups           public void SetColorbyte Red, byte Green, byte Blue              R  Red         G  Green         B  Blue         Transform           public void SetColorColor ColorIn              R  ColorIn.R         G  ColorIn.G         B  ColorIn.B         Transform       codepre  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2780 pIm a newbie with nodejs but I am excited about the possibility of a common language and idiom between client and server.p  pDoes anyone know of a nodejs framework that provides the same OO idiom and class functionality for Models that were used on the client with backbonejs I find it jarring to switch between backbone models and collections and handrolled javascript classes in node.p  pControllers are replaced by emitters and callbacks, and of course there are no views, but am I wrongheaded to want a consistent OO paradigm for Models client and server side Should I be using a databaseagnostic OOP to meet that objective such as Redisp  pIf this question is too vague for SE feel free to shut me down.p

Negative 2780 pI have been reading up on a custom lowspeed communication protocol, which calculates a CRC for the full payload.  This payload may be split up into multiple packets.

The protocol designers knew about the CRC packetlevel option.p  pThe only reasons I can think of arep  ol liThe layer passing the payload down to the lower protocol layer does not necessarily know if the lower layer already has a CRCli liThe layer passing the payload doesnt know if the lower protocol layers configuration has the CRC enabled.li liThe layer passing the payload down is using an advanced error checking or correction technique on the payload.li liThe layer passing the payload down is protecting the payload against potentially badflaky lower layershardware.li ol  p1, 2, amp 3 do not apply in this situation.

Negative 2780 pI apologize in advance if this has already been answered. Ive Googled around for a few hours now, and I still havent found anything that seems to answer my exact question. p  pEssentially, I have a very complexhighly styled view which is displaying userspecific data pulled from the database. Ive captured the data as a JSON object, attached it to the body my page using .data. Ive added a button that retrieves the JSON object and opens my printer friendly page in a new window. I want to be able to accessmanipulate the userspecific JSON object from within this new window. This would all be on the same domain. p  pMost of the solutions Ive seen seem to be centered around opening a new, blank window. I dont want to do that. Ive coded a layout for the page, and I plan on having javascriptcss which also runs. Ive seen solutions that involve opening a new window and then using document.write, which would be great, if there was a way to target a specific element on the new page. Ive tried, for examplep  precodex  window.openurl x.document.writemyJson codepre  pWhich does put the JSON object on the new page, but completely wipes everything else I had in the layout. p  pIve also seen solutions that suggest stringifying and then Base64 encoding the object. But Im concerned about URL length restrictions, given that they could potentially be gathering a lot of data on this page before clicking the button. p  pIve also seen solutions that suggest using HTML5 local storage. Which I suppose Ill do, if theres no better solution. However HTML5 raises browser compatibility issues, and Id prefer to avoid them if possible.  p  pHeres some example codep  pJSON objectp  precode   namePercy Pea., bioPercy Pea was born in a pod, and lived there happily. ,  nameJames Cob, bioJames Cob was arrested for stalking.   codepre  pI capture that when it comes back from the server as datap  precodebody.data userData, data codepre  pIn my onclick for the printer friendly page button, I retrieve the JSON objectp  precodevar userData  body.datauserData codepre  pSo is this doable Is there so way to open a new window, and then insertattach data to a specific element inside it Or...maybe some other way I havent even considered.p  pThanks in advance for any help, although I will also be sure to checkmark the answer, once its posted.  p

From checking my TOR connection in other ways, I can tell that my services were never all removed. They just stayed at whatever the last hidden services I set...p  p... so I could keep spinning my wheels or search for valhalla in the source code... or maybe some enlightened soul can inform me... how do I get rid of my hidden services in stemp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe problem seems to be a bug in how HiddenServiceOptions updates itself.p  pWith a hidden service enabled, when I set both HiddenServiceDir and HiddenServicePort to None or to empty strings both have the exact same effect, it shows in my confmap and I see a conf event sent out from a listener on my controller with configuration  HiddenServiceOptionsNone  or as parsedcontent, just HiddenServiceOptions with no equal sign or anything. This is as expected.p  p...NOW, if I set another hidden service, I get a new configuration event sent to me showing the correct hidden service info. At this point, the hidden service WORKS, BUT it still wont show if I ask it with getconfmap.p  pThen I run resetconf and it shows fine again.p  pThe takeaway if you setup a new service, first check if there are none. If so, set the hidden service, then run resetconf...p  pOr for people who only rely on eventlisteners, this doesnt affect them at all...p  pThanks, Damian...p

Negative 2780 pSo, I was reading about pointers, and came across the concept of pointers to arrays. The thing is that a pointer to an array doesnt really seem useful at all, since instead of using a pointer to have an offset to access an array element, I could just get the element directly. However I feel as if Im missing the reason why these can be useful.p  pSo, in short, What is the point of pointers to arrays How and why should they be used, and do they have any practical applicationsp  pstrongEditstrong I meant this in the context of normalsimple arrays such asp  precodeint array[5] codepre  pstrongEditstrong As Keith Pointed out, Im specifically asking about pointers to arrays, for example codechar ptr[42]code which is a pointer to a 42element array of char.p

Negative 2780 pI have an AngularJSCordova application for iOS which makes calls to a remote API. p  pSometimes, our users have slow or lowquality connection on their mobile phones, and therefore cannot perform a certain action on the phone. p  pDuring this time, the user can tap on other buttons which fires off more network requests, and they become queued up and causes the application to hang.p  pWhat would be the best way to help remedy this situation I was thinking of the following optionsp  ol liRequests that time out after a certain n seconds will simply be aborted.li liUse debounce to wait n msecs before firing off a request, and cancel the timer if the user does something else this still wouldnt account for failed requests that are made on the slow network.li liAdd failedtimed out requests to a queue, and send them later when there is a more reliable connection not sure how to accomplish this. li ol  pDoes anyone know of any other solutions  and any ideas on implementation p  pAny advice highly appreciated.

Negative 2780 pI have a relatively simple portraitonly UI, laid out in a Storyboard, with items which I want to vertically spread to fill both 3.5 inch and 4 inch screens.p  pIn other words, I want the spacing between the controls to be adjusted so that the UI nicely fills the screen, irrespective of the screen form factor.p  pThis doesnt seem like an unusual thing to want to do, however I just cant get Interface Builder within Xcode 5 to add the right constraints  I only seem to be able to get it to add fixed vertical space constraints, which do not adjust for different screen sizes.p  pDoes anyone know how to do this without resorting to programmatic UI construction  Ive invested a lot of effort in getting the Storyboardbased UI just right.p  pThe solution needs to work on both iOS 6 and 7.

Negative 2780 pWe have a Oracle 10g and most of our applications are running Oracle Forms 6i.

Negative 2780 pI have a codeUITextViewcode inside a codeUITableViewCellcode subclass. It has codeeditablecode and codeuserInteractionEnabledcode both set to codeNOcode. This allows the codeUITextViewcode to detect data such as links and phone numbers. The data is detected correctly, but because userInteraction is disabled, it cannot respond to taps on that data. If I set codeuserInteractionEnabledcode to codeYEScode, it works fine, but then the codeUITableViewCellcode cannot be selected since the UITextView swallows the touch. p  pstrongI want to follow the link if the user taps on it, but I want codedidSelectRowAtIndexPathcode to be called if the tap is on basic text.strongp  pI think the right approach is to subclass codeUITextViewcode and pass touches to the cell, but I cant seem to find a way to detect whether or not the tap was on a link.p  pThis is a similar question, but the answer will just pass all touches to the cell.

Negative 2780 pI have a i54250U which has AVX2 and FMA3.  I am testing some dense matrix multiplication code in GCC 4.8.1 on Linux which I wrote.  Below is a list of three difference ways I compile. p  precodeSSE2     gcc matrix.cpp o matrixgcc O3 msse2 fopenmp AVX      gcc matrix.cpp o matrixgcc O3 mavx  fopenmp AVX2FMA gcc matrix.cpp o matrixgcc O3 marchnative fopenmp ffastmath codepre  pThe SSE2 and AVX version are clearly different in performance.  However, the AVX2FMA is no better than the AVX version.  I dont understand this.  I get over 80 of the peak flops of the CPU assuming there is no FMA but I think I should be able to do a lot better with FMA. Matrix Multiplication should benefit directly from FMA.  Im essentially doing eight dot products at once in AVX.

Im not sure why but at least Im seeing something now.p  pOne side effect is that I now get a small error when I compare to a simple matrix multiplication algorithm I know I trust.  I think thats due to the fact that FMA only has one rounding mode instead of what would normally be two which ironically breaks IEEE floating point rules even though its probably better.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pSomebody needs to redo a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8389648howtoachieve4flopspercyclehow to achieve 4 FLOPs per cyclea but do 8 double floating point FLOPS per cycle with Haswell.  p  pstrongEditstrong p  pActually, Mysticial has updated his project to support FMA3 see his answer in the link above.

Negative 2780 pI have a quite complex .Net page with an intensive usage of a third party libraries DevExpress. My page is composed of several partsbrp  ul liA Result Browser to let user select the content of two widgets ul liA Table widgetli liA Graphic widgetli ulli liA timer AspxTimer to refresh the Result browser contentsbrli liA time widget which gives time every secondbrli ul  pI make an intensive use of CallBacks AspxCallBack to minimize the volume of data to transfer fromto the server for the refresh of the browsertable and graphic. During tests, each element separately is working well but one of the feature of the table is to recalculate sub totals of the table when user click on a specific button. I have marked the correct subTotal cells containing the span during table construction with appropriate properties so I can find them on client side with javascript codeltspan ... SubTotaltruegt0.0ltspangtcode and have a vector of class code, number to store actual numbers do recalculate subTotal from.p  p.

Nothing else but the relative complexity and parallel usage of javascriptcallbacks can really explain this behavior. I managed to avoid any parallel Callback chaining them but cant do that with client side events or datetime timer. I wonder If there is a general clean way of dealing with client side parallel run timercallbacksuser actions. Thanks for any clue on this topic.p

I would like to supply this API as an addon for my main website. Now Im looking for a way to optionally deployadd the API together with the website. p  pMy idea was that I copy the DLL of my WebApi into the bin folder of my normal MVC website and that I use reflection on start up to add the routes from the API controllers in my DLL. But when I copy the WebApi DLL into the bin folder, ASP.NET is running trough the global.asax.cs code from the WebApi and already starts trying to handle the routes. p  pMy questions p  pIs this a good way of adding WebApi functionality to and existing project, or are there better ways Is there a way to prevent my copied WebApi DLL from starting automaticallyp

Negative 2780 pIm using NLTK to process some text that is extracted from PDF files.

What if the file in ggFileName is changed outside my application   Assigning the same file again to ggFileName does not calls my setter, so ReadXmlSchemaFromFile is also not called.

My setter does get called, but only when assigning a different value 2. I do not want to use a method, because after setting the property I want some checks to be done and I do not want any other user of my class to be able to bypas that check. that is what properties are for, or not  3. The code that assignes a value I cannot post. It is a property of a custom control and it is called by the designer by editing the object inspector.

Negative 2780 pI am using RoR4, Cancan1.5.0 and Devise3.2.2. I am using TestUnit to test my application.

Negative 2780 pthank you in advance. Every time an user get a call they will summarize it in this form, user validation is not necessary since there are just a few of them but the idea is that every time that the form is submitted the username goes back to the input field, so the user doesnt have to type their names over and over.

Negative 2780 pDiagonalizing a 2x2 hermitian matrix is simple, it can be done analytically. However, when it comes to calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors over 106 times, it is important to do it as efficient as possible. Especially if the offdiagonal elements can vanish it is not possible to use one formula for the eigenvectors An ifstatement is necessary, which of course slows down the code. Thus, I thought using Eigen, where its stated that the diagonalization of 2x2 and 3x3 matrices is optimized, would be still a good choicep  pusingp  precodeconst stdcomplexltdoublegt I  0.,1.  inline double blockdistr  double W     return W2.  rand  WRANDMAX  codepre  pa testloop would bep  precode...

However, the strongHashSetstrong adds all 4 entries to the set. I even tried to use the strongcontainsstrong to check if the object already exists, but that did not work either. I believe, this is because the contains method is comparing the strongreferencestrong and not the strongvaluestrong.

This file is committed into the repository and overrides an   individuals core.autocrlf setting, ensuring consistent behavior for   all users, regardless of their Git settings. The advantage of a   .gitattributes file is that your line configurations are associated   with your repositoryp blockquote  pThis makes it clear that .gitattributes is capable of overriding autocrlf, but there are no settings in it that tell it to do any eol conversion. Maybe there is some default that is implicitly used.p

Negative 2780 pI could really use some help mocking the dependencies in this scenario.p  pI have a client function that I need to test. It takes a 3rd party API resource and calls a method on it, populating the rest of its arguments with the output p  precodevoid ClassAenumerateConnectedDevicesThirdPartyAPIBusManager amp busMgr, QListltQByteArraygt ampdevices, QStringList ampdescriptions codepre  pAt some point in this functions flow, it makes a call on the busMgr object whose signature looks like thisp  precodeThirdPartyAPIError busMgr.GetNumOfCameras... codepre  pAnd the client code that uses that call looks like thisp  precodeThirdPartyAPIError err  busMgr.GetNumOfCamerasampnumCameras  if err  ThirdPartyAPIERROROK   compares against some enum     cout ltlt Error  ltlt err.GetDescription  codepre  pThe problem I ran into is the copy of the error returned from GetNumberOfCameras to the err local variable. Mocking out the BusManager and Error classes works until that copy is made. Since the mock error is a subclass of ThirdPartyAPIError, the assignment operator slices the mock away. The third party API constructs valid error objects and returns them. Client code can only copyconstruct or assign them. p  pAll I need is to return valid mock error objects from my mocked BusManager for the SUT method to be testable. Im open to refactoring the SUT method as long as the intent remains the same.p  pAny suggestions will be greatly appreciatedp  pCheers,p  pAlexp

Negative 2780 pbI have edited the question for brevity and claritybp  pbMy goal is to find and XPath expression that will result in test1...test8 listed separately.bp  pI am working with codexpathApplycode to extract text from web pages. Due to the layout of various different pages that information will be pulled from, I need to extract the XML values from all codeltfontgtcode and codeltpgtcode html tags. The problem I run into is when one type is nested within the other, resulting in partial duplicates when I use the following codexpathApplycode expression with an codeorcode condition.p  precoderequireXML     html lt    ltDOCTYPE htmlgt   lthtml langengt     ltbodygt       ltpgttest1ltpgt       ltfontgttest2ltfontgt       ltpgtltfontgttest3ltfontgtltpgt       ltfontgtltpgttest4ltpgtltfontgt       ltpgttest5ltfontgttest6ltfontgtltpgt           ltfontgttest7ltpgttest8ltpgtltfontgt     ltbodygt   lthtmlgt work lt htmlTreeParsehtml, useInternal  TRUE, encodingUTF8 table lt xpathApplywork, pfont, xmlValue  table codepre  pIt should be easy to see the type of issue that comes with the nestingbecause sometimes codeltfontgtcode and codeltpgtcode tags are nested, and sometimes they arent, I cant ignore them but searching for both gives me partial dupes. For other reasons, I prefer the text pieces to be broken up rather than aggregated that is, taken from the lowest levelfurthest nested tag.p  pThe reason I am not just doing two separate searches and then appending them after removing duplicate strings is that I need to preserve the ordering of text as it appears in the html. p  pThanks for readingp

Negative 2780 pWith ASP.NET 4.5 it is possible to use codeAssembly.Loadcode or codeAppDomain.CurrentDomain.Loadcode to dynamically load an assembly at runtime.

Negative 2780 pWe are evaluating Xamarin Forms for our next project to develop the same application for the three major platforms Android, iOS and Windows Phone.p  pAs we mostly work with WP and Windows apps within the company, we have a well working base setup for work environment.

It installed fine, but when I tried to create a new Forms project, it only created the Android part of it, no WP or iOS projects were created.p  pAfter checking the settings and all, it turns out that Xamarin Studio wont load the iOS and WP parts which would make it possible to create the projects.p  pHow could I make it see those extensionsp

Negative 2780 pI have taken a highly detailed trace of a surface in order to try and calculate the Surface Roughness eg. Ra or Rz.

Negative 2780 pI am trying to use the ELK ElasticsearchLogstashKibana stack in the following scenariop  pI have about ten applications that send their logs, through Logstash, to a single Elasticsearch cluster.p  pSome of these applications naturally generate more logs than others, and, sometimes, one of them can go crazy, because of a bug, for instance, and, thus, generate even more log entries than it normally does. As result, the disk space available in the cluster can be unfairly taken by the logs of a single application, leaving not enough room to others.p  pI am currently managing the available disk space through Elasticsearch Curator. It runs periodically, as it is in the crontab, and deletes older indices based on a disk usage quota. When the disk space used by all indices exceeds a certain limit, the oldest indices are deleted, one by one, util the sum of the disk space used by them all is within the specified limit again.p  pThe first problem with this approach is that Elasticsearch Curator can only delete entire indices. Hence, I had to configure Logstash to create one different index per hour, and increase their granularity thus, Curator deletes smaller chunks of logs at a time. In addition, it is very difficult to decide how often Curator should run. If applications are generating logs at a higher rate, not even onehour indices may be enough. Secondly, there is no way to specify a disk usage quota for each different application.p  pIdeally, Elasticsearch should be able to delete older log entries by itself whenever the indices reach a certain disk usage limit. This would eliminate the problem of defining how often Curator should run. However, I could not find any similar feature in the Elasticsearch manual. p  pWould anybody recommend a different approach to address these issuesp  pReferences a hrefhttpwww.elasticsearch.org relnofollowhttpwww.elasticsearch.orga a hrefhttpsgithub.comelasticsearchcurator relnofollowhttpsgithub.comelasticsearchcuratorap

Negative 2780 pI have written two different queries, the first one is supposed to get the first 5 objects, and then the next one is supposed to get the next 5 objects ordered by the purchased value.

Negative 2780 pSo I have an android base project that I want to split into various flavors. Assigning seperate xmls is easy enough, and so is classes. However the problem arises when there are calls from the base classes to the flavor classes. Say for instance I havep  precodepackage app.myapp.service  import app.flavor1.ClassB import app.flavor2.ClassB import app.flavor3.ClassB import app.flavor4.ClassB  public class Class A      Class B bar  new Class B      bar.foo  codepre  pSo depending on the flavor build I still want to use the Class B implementation of it, however I cannot import both classes as each specific flavor wont recognise an import that is not in that project structure. Thus, on build of the project it will throw an error as that import is not recognised. If it were only two flavors I may be able to do a buildconfig to fix it however if the flavors become 2 it becomes a problem. How would I fix this Or maybe put differently can I still import multiple flavors from my base classes Thanksp

Negative 2780 pIm interested in taking a deeper look into the firmware of my Behringer X32 mixing console, so i downloaded the actual file from a hrefhttpwww.behringerdownload.deX32X32Firmware2.10.ziphttpwww.behringerdownload.deX32X32Firmware2.10.zipa and started IDA pro. The contained .updatefile inside starts with some kind of timestamp and the following stringtable pretty much looks line a directory listing, I assume those to be the files that got somehow concatenated into the firmware update file. For example, there is the stringp  precodeseg00000005480 logoX32RACK.bmp codepre  pbut as there is no bitmaplike structure, i assume this to be compressed data.

Negative 2780 pI have been working on a compass in Actionscript 3.0 air, android 3.2 where the arrow is meant to point towards a goal for mobiles, but i have this problem where the compass is only pointing towards the goal as long you point your mobile towards north, if you turn around the arrow wont update. My gusse is that my app cant check the cardinal derictions and compare them to my goal.p  pThe only potential solution i can think off is that i will have to start the app with the user moving the mobile the take out two of those points to determine in what direction the mobile is heading and store the value and use it together with the accelerometer to detect if the mobile is turning.

Negative 2780 pFor reference, please see this a hrefhttpsdevelopers.arcgis.comjavascriptjssamplesmapdynamiclayerlist.html relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.arcgis.comjavascriptjssamplesmapdynamiclayerlist.htmlap  pBut, unlike the ESRI example, I am loading several different Services and each Service has multiple Layers.

Negative 2780 pI need to create a REST session facade for a JMS queue, the client will send a POST message containing a value for the JMSCorrelationID and the data to put in the queue in another process, the data will be retrieved with that ID through the REST session facade.p  pHow I can achieve this with Switchyard and Camel.p  pThe client application cant interact with a JMS queue, so accessing directly to the queue its not an option.p  pI have an idea for the first step using the setHeader tag, but  dont know how to implement the second step.p

Negative 2780 pI have some java code that works well in java but doesnt work at all in android.

I cant use an emulator because I am working with preexisting code and I just need this specific library to use the java versions of libraries. Is there a way where I can package this to include the default java libraries into the jar so that it only uses the java libraries and nothing from androidp  pHere is the code so far, there may be bugs in code as I have been modifying it to work as a library but the original code did work as a jar file that sent an email every time you ran the application.p  precodepublic class Main   public static void mainString User, String Pass, String host      System.out.printlnStarting     ExchangeService service  new ExchangeServiceExchangeVersion.Exchange2007SP1     ExchangeCredentials credentials  new WebCredentialsUser, Pass     service.setCredentialscredentials     try          String ewshost  host         service.setUrlnew java.net.URIewshost         EmailMessage msg new EmailMessageservice         msg.setSubjectHello world         msg.setBodyMessageBody.getMessageBodyFromTextSent using the EWS Java API.         msg.getToRecipients.addUser         msg.send         System.out.printlnFinished      catch Exception e          e.printStackTrace        codepre  pUpdate When I tried to compile this with its prerequisite classes extracted and included in the jar this is the output I received when I tried to use my library in android.p  pcodewarning Ignoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class org.apache.commons.logging.impl.WeakHashtable1 that doesnt come with an associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced by a compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended solution is to recompile the class from source, using an uptodate compiler and without specifying any target type options. The consequence of ignoring this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly indicate that it is not an inner class.codep  pGiven what I can tell from fiddling around this is because the dependencies of the library I have created is conflicting with the default libraries.

Negative 2780 pI have a tableView on which I can add cells normally. Just so you understand, my tableView is populated by a core data on which I use fetch to get the items and add them to a mutable array, all the usual. After the fetch though, I call the reload method from tableview. But if I enter the cell to edit its content, when I get back to it, the tableview gets reordered automatically and I think thats because of the reload method, but if I dont call it, nothing shows up from the fetch. Here is my fetchp  precodeNSManagedObjectContext managedObjectContext  [self managedObjectContext] NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] initWithEntityNameEntity1] NSFetchRequest fetchRequest2  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] initWithEntityNameEntity2] self.titles  [[managedObjectContext executeFetchRequestfetchRequest errornil]mutableCopy] self.stitles  [[managedObjectContext executeFetchRequestfetchRequest2 errornil]mutableCopy]  [self.tableView reloadData] codepre  pAlso, it only reorders the second array, the one with the subtitles.

So I tried changing the data by datum because I read somewhere that the last should be used if you are not looking to dynamically update your layout, and I removed the enter and exit calls since I read they are not needed because the datum does not compute such functions.

Negative 2780 pI tried implementing an iterative deepening Depth first search algorithm in C, but it is not returning an optimal solution.

When depth is increased, the process starts over.  Visited is cleared, and frontier is cleared as well.  So, there is some looking at repeat states in the next iterations of the inner loop.p  pLets try for another explanation.  The outer loop is basically the iterative part, while the inner loop does the searching.  The inner loop only goes as far in depth as the outer loop says.  However, the outer loop continues to increase the depth until the inner loop finds a solution.  p  pMy algorithm appears to methodically investigates all possible states, similar to breadth first search, but using an iterative maximum depth.  But it is not returning an optimal solution, only a near optimal solution, and IDDFS is supposed to be optimal.  p  pPerhaps I need to be checking to see if any Child nodes are in the frontier in addition to the visited set before adding them to the frontier in my inner loop  I dont see how this would help it find an optimal solution, though.p
Negative 2780 pWeve evaluating a a possible addition to our virtualized SQL Server environment.  I have to test disk IO and have been looking at DISKSPD and quite happy with it.  I just ran with the accelator cards enabled and the performance was significantly degraded.p  pThe vendor stated the synthetic workload wasnt a good test of the system and suggested HammerDB.  HammerDB doesnt seem to give the same control and requires a lot more moving parts to capture the same data.p  pAnyone with an opinion one way or the otherp
