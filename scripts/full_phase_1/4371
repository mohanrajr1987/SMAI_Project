Negative 4371 pI am writing a program that has to access images from a legacy data file format. To be specific The program is loading its UI images directly from the data files of an old game Since the images are all stored as Targa TGA files, I have to preprocess them into PNG files. I do that in a local application data folder.p  pMy problem is writingauthoring XAML files using these images. Since I dont want to redistribute the images Copyright issues, I cant just include them as resources in my application. This excludes the normal way of including images in WPF controls.p  pWhat Ive successfully tried is putting the preprocessed images in the same directory as the applications assembly and reference them using packsiteoforigin,,,cacheimage.png. This also works from within the XAML Designer in Visual Studio as well as Expression Blend 3.p  pThe issue with this approach is, that the applications directory is not neccessarily writable as the current user Especially if the application resides in CProgram Files, so storing the images there during the preprocess phase is out of the question for me.p  pAn alternative approach I successfully used is creating a custom WebRequest protocol like cache and use that for the image URLs. This works in the actual application, but not in Visual Studios designer or Expression Blend.p  pIs anyone aware of another good way to reference images in the filesystem using WPF Or some way to customize the resource loading, that is compatible with the usual WPF Authoring solutionsp

After the reading users would press already read it and administrator would know who did itwho did not.p  pI created simple workflow in office designer and choose assigne task to Group1, which is in the sharepoint server. After WF run everyone who is in Group1 get message about a task, thats great. However this task is general for group and if we go to the site section current tasks, we can see it, while I want this task for every person in Group1.p  pFuther question, is it possible to create form where administrator will choose users for this task, cause now I munualy set group in WF.p

Negative 4371 pI believe for a typical MVC web application the router  dispatcher routine is used to decide which controller is loaded based primarily on the area requested in the url by the user.p  pHowever, in addition to checking the url query string, I also like to use the dispatcher to check whether the user is currently logged in or not to decide which controller is loaded. For example if they are logged in and request the login page, the dispatcher would load their account instead.p  pBut is this a fairly nonstandard design Would it violate MVC in any way I only ask as the examples Ive read through this weekend have had no major calculations performed before the dispatcher routine, and commonly check whether the user is logged in or not per controller, and then redirect where necessary. p  pBut to me it seems odd to redirect a logged in user from the login area to account area if you could just load the account controller in the first placep  pI hope Ive explained my consternation well enough, but could anyone offer some details on how they handle logged in users, and similar session datap

Negative 4371 pIve got this question awhile ago, but it still bothers me. p  pI work with a few virtual machines running Windows 2008 server, mostly demo VMs and test machines. Since most devs use them, I prefer to not have individual setups here and there and maintain a catalog of exported VMs and hard drive images instead.p  pThanks to sidebyside assemblies and windows updates each server carries an overhead of about 6  12 Gigs in sidebyside folder winsxs and windows update.p  pSuppose I have 50 exported VMs with their images, each has about 3 Gigs of payload data OS, programs, data and about 12 Gigs of shared overhead, which is mostly the same for all these VMs. Then I waste 23 of my storage space about 600 Gigs total, not to mention network overhead of pushing this redundant data around the network when a dev wants to download a new VM snapshot.p  pSo I am thinking of a way of consolidating the winsxs folder accross multiple VMS. Ideally, Id like to come up with some shared drive or something. I am even willing to designate a physical device for this. p  pI realize that Windows server has minimum requirements and these files cannot be deleted httpsocial.technet.microsoft.comForumsenUSitprovistasetupthread9411dbaa69ac43a18915749670cec8c3.p  pI also found a post on a hrefhttpblog.tiensivu.comaaronarchives1391MovingtheWinSXSdirectoryandtheSoftwareDistributionusedbyWindowsUpdatefolderoutoftheWindowsdirectory.html relnofollowmoving winsxs foldera, but it does not appear as a reliable solution.p  pDoes this sound even remotely feasible What are the best practices for consolidating resources across VMsp  pThank you almighty stackoverflow gurus for your prompt attention  p

Negative 4371 pSuppose I write my code very defensively and always check the return types from all the functions that I call.p  pSo I go likep  precodechar function      char mem  getmemory100   first allocation     if mem return NULL      struct binder b  getbinderregular binder   second allocation     if b          freemem         return NULL           struct file f  mkfile   third allocation     if f          freemem         freebinderb         return NULL            ...  codepre  pNotice how quickly codefreecode things get out of control. If some of the function fails, I have to free every single allocation before. The code quickly becomes ugly and all I do is copy paste everything over. I become a copypaste programmer, even worse, if someone adds a statement somewhere in between, he has to modify all the code below to call the codefreecode for his addition.p  pHow do experienced C programmers go about this problem I cant figure anything out.p  pThanks, Boda Cydo.p
Negative 4371 pI have to split a JEDI VCS server. I have 4 Delphi projects on it, and I have to give 2 projects to a company and 2 to the other company.p  pThe idea is to restore 2 JEDI VCS backups 2 database backups, and remove the projects of the other customer. Now it is not possible to really remove a project from JEDI because of referencial integrity as described in a hrefhttpjedivcs.sourceforge.netjvcsfaqindex.phpactionartikelampcat15ampid48ampartlangenamphighlightremove relnofollowthis article in JEDI VCS FAQa.p  pSo since deleting is not possible I had the idea of writing NULL in the blob fields where the source files are kept. In this way if customer 1 tries to restore customer 2 projects he will simply get the file list and then probably an error on reading the files. If I can set NULL to the tables the dpr dfm pas files will not be really there in the db anymore.p  pIs this possiblebr Did anyone wrote a query that does thisp  pThe server version is V 2.4.1.790.p
Negative 4371 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI am working on a site that will be available in multiple regions. Each region can have a different language, or different spellings for the same language. We are planning on using an XML label file which will contain all the text that will be displayed for any given region. p  pSo regionA will load RegionALabels.xml and all of its text will come from that. RegionB will load RegionBLabels.xml, and so on.p  pIm thinking of implementing this by structuring the XML file so that it follows the same structure as my application. For example, p  precodeltBasegt ltBaseControllergt   ltHomegt ltHomeControllergt     ltHomePartial1gt       ltlblFirstNamegttext for label with ID lblFirstNameltlblFirstNamegt       ltlblLastNamegttext for label with ID lblLastNameltlblLastNamegt     ltHomePartial1gt     ltHomePartial2gt       lta bunch of labelsgt     ltHomePartial2gt   ltHomegt   ltAccountsgt     ltAccountsPartial1gt       lta bunch of labelsgt     ltAccountsPartial1gt     ltAccountsPartial2gt       lta bunch of labelsgt     ltAccountsPartial2gt   ltAccountsgt ltBasegt codepre  pThe reason I want to do it this way is because I want to imploy Convention over Configuration, so it becomes implicit where to find the text for any given partial view.p  pusing this structure, I can use LinqtoXML to select the text relevant to the partial view Im going to Render. For example, if Im rendering the partial view HomePartial1, I can get the labels associated with that partial view with something likep  precode        var nodes  from f in                         from res in this.XmlConfiguration.DescendantsBase                          select res.DescendantsHome                     select f          var HomePartial1Labels  nodes.ElementsHomePartial1.ToList codepre  pstrongQuestionstrong p  pSo this being the case, basically what I want to ask is if anyone can point out any obvious holes in this approach before I attempt to implement this Can anyone who has dealt with this before suggest something betterp  pstrongalsostrong, I have one specific requriement to render a partial view with a number of tabs, each of which has to display text amp a number of results associated with that tab. For example, I have 3 tabsp  precodeFund Company Group codepre  pIf somebody does a search, the tabs have to display the number of results the search term returns for the tab, so if I search for JP Morgan they becomep  precodeFund 10  10 funds contain the name JP Morgan Company 12  12 companies contain the name JP Morgan Group 15  15 groups contain the name JP Morgan codepre  pIn order to contain the text Fund, Company and Group in the label file, Im going to have to supply the  and  also, which means I think Ill have to use a place holder and replace it with the actual value when Im rendering the partial. So the XML will begin to look likep  precodeltBasegt ltBaseControllergt   ltHomegt ltHomeControllergt     ltTabsgt       ltlblFundTabgtFunds valueltlblFundTabgt       ltlblCompanyTabgtCompany valueltlblCompanyTabgt       ltlblGroupTabgtGroup valueltlblGroupTabgt     ltTabsgt   ltHomegt ltBasegt codepre  pbut I think this is going to start to look messy and a little hackish. Can somebody suggest something better Thanks.p

Negative 4371 pSo Im messing around with a new project in Delphi 2009 and the default components that can be dropped onto a form for accessing data consist of a SQLConnection, DataSource and SQLQuery. If I add a simple select to the query component, say p  precodeselect name from customers codepre  pand then drop a DBComboBox on the form and link it up with the DataSource I get a single record in the combo box. After using Google for half and hour to figure out what I was doing wrong it looks like you have to manually add some code to your project which loops through the dataset and adds all the records to the drop down box. Something likep  precodewhile not SQLQuery.eof do begin   DBComboBox.items.addSQLQuery.fieldbynamename.asstring   SQLQuery.next end  codepre  pAnd that actually sort of works, but then you get a list in the drop down which you cant actually select anything from. Regardless of the result though Im wondering why would you even use a DBComboBox if you have to manually add the result of your query to it Seems to me that if it doesnt automatically populate the db combo box with the result of the query then we might as well be using a nondataaware component like tcombobox. p  pI guess what Im asking is why does it work this way Isnt the purpose of data aware draganddrop controls to minimize the amount of actual written code and speed development Is there a method that Im missing that is supposed to make this easierp

Thanksp  pEDITp  pThe studentID is generated in a while loop so Im using the hours on that student before I move to the next one. Im getting all the hours for one student in each quarter, adding them this has to be done outside of the sql, storing results in a variable then moving to the next student. This works perfect when I get 1 quarter but im having an issue getting all the quarters.p  pEDIT Round 2 Did it in a rather lazy way I supposep  pI just selected all the hours and quarterIDs for a specific student. Then ran a whileodbcfetchrow. If it was a 201101 I added it to the q1 pile, 201102 added to the q2 pile, and so on. Processing is a little slower but not a big issue with what Im doing.p

Negative 4371 pSo I feel like a serious rookie right now, but I have a problem I cant seem to figure out.  I have a barebones app, with literally nothing in it except a login screen and a second view containing a tableview.  When I add the second view after logging in I have done this like 4 times before..., the table view goes through its delegates and appears that its going to load, but something happens.  I have enabled my NSZombies, and it appears to be deallocating the new view, right before it appears.  p  pAfter tracing through it, and building up again piece by piece, it appears to happen after I wire the table to the view as the datasourcedelegate in IB.  I have set the view as a UITableViewDelegate, and the methods indeed get fired.  Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this behaviorp

Negative 4371 pI have a question about strongserializatonstrong of data structures. There are a many possibilies for serialization of data structures also called strongmarshallingstrong or strongdeflatingstrong, see a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSerialization relnofollowwikiarticlea. Every programming language, framework, standard or library seems to bring their own methods of serialization with it. Many also define their own datainterface description language which i prefer to language dependend data structure defined only inside the code. Just to name a few see a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiComparisonofdataserializationformats relnofollowwikiarticlea COM IDL, CORBA IDL, Thrift IDL, google protocol buffer .proto, XSD, ASN.1 IDL, and so on. Some of these serialzations are able generate language native data structure and code for serialize and deserialize these structures.p  pI did some research on this subject, but i am still undecided. So my question is strongWhich serialization should i usestrong p  pstrongMy requirementsstrong strongextensibilitystrong, space efficiency at least binary, efficient access to data, ease to use possibly with generated code and getter and setters and ccompability. p  pstrongThe extensibility should provide forward and backward compabilitystrong. To be more specific, often the data formats i write will grow over the time, because i add new data fields, which i couldnt foresee at the beginning of the development. Now i would like to be able to read stored data from an outdated format with a newer software version, the data fields not found in the old stored data could be filled with default values or something. On the other side i would like to be able to read data written with the new desription. The unknown data field should be then ignored by software compiled with the old data description maybe generating some warning.p  pstrongAny recommondationsstrong Recommondations on further readings on that subject would be appreciated too.p  pstrong Edit strongp  p1 boostserialization seems to be quite popular.

Unfortunately, it doesnt work, connection times out.p  pAny ideasp  p[EDITED]p  h2More details on the problemh2  pThe code I wrote above is an example I took from the JoCaml manual as it was an analogous and simplified version of my own piece of code where the question came up. The program Im writing aims to create a P2P network of JoCaml runtimes which all make private computations, and store their results locally, relying on data stored in other peers of the network. So, I want to have a set of peers all running something similar to q.ml, in that they need to connect to other machines and fetch the information they need from them.p  pEach peer needs to keep a list of its peers. You can then query the network for some value in a simple way. Each peer will check if it knows that value if so returns it, if not it asks its peers and so on, recursively. The P2P architecture is really good for my purposes. The centralised topology suggested by Gilles wont work for my particular problem due to the performance and reliability issues mentioned in his answer. Ive introduced a special bootstrap peer which all code knows about and to which any new peer will first connect to get access to the network. Once the new peer is authenticated by the bootstrap peer, it should join the network and become a firstclass peer on its own and may ignore the bootstrap peer from then on. These peers will all communicate directly between them 11 so there needs to be a way for each arbitrary pair of peers to establish a connection between them. Also, since Id like anyone with appropriate credentials to be able to join this network, regardless of their network skills, I cant have a solution where people need to configure their router to join the P2P network. They should just run the software out of the box.p  pMy requirements are thenp  ol liP2P network of peers on the internet so, 11 connection between any two nodesli lipeers may be behind opaque routersli lino local router configurationli lispecial bootstrap peer to which you first connect and authenticateli ol  pWhat I currently have works well if we dont require 2. Any suggestions to solve the initial problem but in this P2P contextp  pNote that the P2P framework is just a means to an end. Yes, Id like to have something that works well, but I dont intend to develop the ultimate supergeneral P2P framework for JoCaml. Im looking to write a simple thing which simply does the job.p

I know the problem arises from the line dest  float32temp, which I hoped would simply copy the bits from temp to dest, with a typecast to make the compiler happy.p  pHowever, Ive realized that this wont be the case, since the operation float x  float43 actually converts 4 to 4.0, ie changing the bits.p  pHow do I coerce the bits in temp into destp  pThanks in advancep  pedit Note that 0x4120000 as an integer is 1092616192, which, as a float, is 0x4e82400p

Negative 4371 pI have various sets of Java objects, some of them pojos generated from JAXB tools, some of them domain classes etc.. In a large application, I need to get data from one set of objects and put into another set of objects which have different capabilities to use the data. p  pThere are various methods of doing this object mapping frameworks being an obvious choice. However, most of these frameworks with a solid code base and community, use reflection.dozer for examplep  pIve been using a combination of adapters which adopt pojos and more complex java classes to visitor pattern, so that a visitor walking on the adaptor walks over one set of objects, and in the process creates another set of objects the objects usually have parentchildtree type of references Especially when pass by reference is used rather than creating new Strings etc, this should be the fastest method available. p  pCan you think of any other method Some sort of serialization to a byte array in memory, then deserialization maybe Could it beat visitor based copies in terms of performance Am I being unfair to reflection based approaches like Dozer  This is a key operation in the application, so any improvements are likely to improve overall performance significantly.p

Negative 4371 pI load icons from exedllico and I display them in a TListView set to vsIcon. The images are stored in a TImageList set as TListView.LargeImages. So each item in TListView is an image  a small text below. The user selects one or more and clicks on a button.

Negative 4371 pIve spent almost 8 hours by searching for an answer on how to get rid of that freakin exception. I have an C application which needs to be localized to several languages. Im using parentlevel language names for resource files i.e. for english language, my resX file is codelang.en.resxcode, for czech it is codelang.cs.resxcode. So Im no bothering about language variants like enUS, enGB. Default namespace for my app is GSMMaster, my app is GSMMaster. My resource manager is constructed like this  p  precodeif autoDetectLanguage      currentCulture  CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCultureselectedLanguage else     currentCulture  CultureInfo.GetCultureInfoCultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name  rManager  new ResourceManagerGSMMaster.lang, Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly codepre  pI have two resX files  czech, and english. Czech works just fine, but english throws that exception. Ive tried all options which Ive found with no luck so far. Does anybody have some experience with that behavior  One language resource works and second not  Or, is there some conventional approach on how to create those files p  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 4371 pstrongFirst, a little explanation about my situationstrongp  pI have a sample interface which is implemented by different classes, and these classes might not always have a shared ancestorp  precode  IMyInterface  interface     [1BD8F7E32C8B4138841B28686708DA4D]     procedure DoSomething   end    TMyImpl  classTInterfacedPersistent, IMyInterface     procedure DoSomething   end    TMyImp2  classTInterfacedObject, IMyInterface     procedure DoSomething   end codepre  pI also have a factory method which is supposed to create an instance of an object which implements my interface. My factory method receives the class name as its parameterp  precode  function GetImplementationconst AClassName string IMyInterface codepre  pI tried two approaches to implement this factory method, the first one was using extended RTTIp  precodevar   ctx  TRttiContext   t  TRttiInstanceType begin   t  ctx.FindTypeAClassName.AsInstance   if Assignedt then     Result  t.GetMethodCreate.Invoket.MetaclassType, [].AsInterface as IMyInterface end codepre  pIn this approach I am calling the default constructor which is fine in my scenario. The problem with this is, at runtime, I get an error telling me the object does not support IMyInterface. Whats more, the created object is not assigned to an interface variable therefore, it will be leaked. I also tried returning the value using TValue.AsType method, but it gives me Access Violationp  precodefunction GetImplementationconst AClassName string IMyInterface var   ctx  TRttiContext   rt  TRttiInstanceType   V  TValue begin   rt  ctx.FindTypeAClassName.AsInstance   if Assignedrt then   begin     V  rt.GetMethodCreate.Invokert.MetaclassType, []     Result  V.AsTypeltIMyInterfacegt   end end codepre  p.p  pThe second approach I tried was using a generic dictionary to hold pairs of , and provide registration, unregistration methodsp  precode  TRepository  class   private     FDictionary  TDictionaryltstring, TClassgt   public     constructor Create     destructor Destroy override     function GetImplementationconst AClassName string IMyInterface     procedure RegisterClassAClass TClass     procedure UnregisterClassAClass TClass   end codepre  pHere I implemented GetImplementation method as thisp  precodefunction TRepository.GetImplementationconst AClassName string IMyInterface var   Obj  TObject begin   if FDictionary.ContainsKeyAClassName then   begin     Obj  FDictionary[AClassName].Create     Obj.GetInterfaceIMyInterface, Result   end end codepre  pThis works fine, and I can call DoSomething method using the returned value of GetImplementation, but it still has the memoryleak problem Obj which is created here is not assigned to any interface variable therefore, it is not referencecounted, and is leaked.p  p.p  pstrongNow, my actual questionstrongp  pSo my question is, how can I safely create an instance of a class which implements my interface at runtime I saw Delphi Spring Framework, and it provides such functionality in its Spring.Services unit, but it has its own reflection routines and lifetime management models. I am looking for a lightweight solution, not a whole 3rdparty framework to do this for me.p  pRegardsp

Negative 4371 pIn my x86 main board, I connect some special interrupt sources including NMI to the south bridge chip.

Currently I cant capture the interrupts in Linux kernel.

Many other applications startup by default in the maximized state, for example when I run firefox, it automatically starts up maximized.p  pNow I read that I can use ShowWindow  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms633548 relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms633548ap  pBy callingp  precodeShowWindowinfo1.window, SWMAXIMIZE codepre  pThe window then maximized when this is called as if the user clicked on the maximized button. However, the problem is that when my application starts, firstly it starts up in a particular size 700 by 500 just for example then when the ShowWindow gets called, it then maximizes. This is a big difference between how Firefox starts up, Firefox starts up and just appears maximized without appearing at a small size first.p  pSo my question is, how to start up maximized without this intermediate window size which is not maximized before the ShowWindow is called It is annoying for the user to see a smaller window which then maximizes suddenly upon startup.p  hr  pIf you can tell me how to do it in MFC or DOT NET, I can probably work out how to do it in SDL, I guess.p

Negative 4371 pIm trying to make a photo feed for an app Im making, similar to Instagramsp  pa hrefhttpwww.fuelyourphotography.comfilesphoto1.PNG relnofollowInstagram photo feedap  pIve created a preliminary version using a UITableView for the feed, but its becoming a hassle dealing with the dynamic nature of each cell. The number of likes and comments along with the comment text itself will determine how tall the cell is. I used UITextViews to draw the comment and like text, and approximate the cell height and positioning using the UITextViews text with sizeWithFont. This solution seems very imprecise and has a lot of downsides.p  pI was thinking about using a UIWebView for the entire feed as an alternate solution. It would make positioning the like and comment text extremely simple, along with the ability to have variable font in the text as seen in Instagram. I havent really used UIWebViews extensively, so Im not sure how easy or hard it would be to create the whole feed this way.p  pShould I continue using my UITableView solution or look into redoing it all using a UIWebViewp

That way, putting them all in one table doesnt duplicate any user data, but I personally still think this approach is plain wrong. Are there any reasons why it would be a benefitp

Negative 4371 pI want to be able to easily store and redisplay a Google Maps Directions Route on a Google Map. Lets say from point A to B, the a hrefhttpcode.google.comapismapsdocumentationjavascriptreference.htmlDirectionsResultDirectionsResulta object from Google has 100 points along the route, I want to be able to store this route and guarantee the next time I paint it the directions will go through all of these points.p  pThe way I have seen people trying to do it is to serialize the entire DirectionsResult object and store it in a database.  Then when we want to redraw the route, send the string back up, JSON.Parse it, and then attempt to feed it to a a hrefhttpcode.google.comapismapsdocumentationjavascriptreference.htmlDirectionsRendererDirectionsRenderera object which will render the directions on the map.  This approach has three problemsp  p1 You lose type information during the serialization process, and since Google minnifies the objects, you arent able to use class functions to get these values out of the object reliably.  You need to first use data accessor functions to build place holder objects when initially serializing the object, then rebuild the Google Maps objects when later parsing the serialized string.p  p2 Its legally dubious.  The Google Maps TOS says you arent supposed to store data permanently and it seems from other posts this approach violates it.p  p3 The object can be huge, one route I serialized was over 64KB.  p  pI also thought about trying to store a few points from the path and then rebuilding it using Waypoints.  This sort of works but you can only have at most 8 points for the free API, so this doesnt guarantee much accuracy beyond those 8 points.  Furthermore, it then paints the waypoint markers along the route which I think could confuse the user.p  pIs there an accepted way to store exact routes from Google Maps, or are the API  and TOS purposefully designed to prevent this  Thanks for the help.p

Negative 4371 pSo Im making a website for a friend of mine whos a lawyer. He gave me a reference to another site the layout of which he liked, and asked me if I could make his similar to that one. The reference site is probably 10 years old and done with 5levelsdeep nested tables so I decided to use CSS like a good web developer. Now the problem is that he wants a twocolumn layout with a header, but one in which one column overlaps the header and one doesnt. I laid the site out like thisp  precodelthtml styleminheight 100gt ltheadgt...ltheadgt ltbody styleminheight 100gt   ltdiv idleft styleheight 100 importantgt     ...stuff...   ltdivgt   ltdiv idheadergt     ...stuff...   ltdivgt   ltdiv idright styleheight 100 importantgt     ...stuff...   ltdivgt ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre  pEverything uses relative positioning and percentage or auto heightwidth. Now the main problem is that both left and right, just as expected, have a height that is 100 of the page. The problem is that the right div is pushed down bu the header div thats right on top of it, so theres some extra room at the bottom of the page that is occupied only by the  right div. Is there a way around this Ive considered changing the style of header to have a percentage height and subtracting that from the height of right, but that seems kludgy to me on top of which itll probably break IE.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 4371 pI have another persons user defined data structure for working on meshes.

Negative 4371 pI was hoping to understand what kind of internal copies of a function object does boostbind do. Since constructors of these objects do not seem to be invoked, I presumed this is a kind of very shallow copy, so I introduced dynamic memory allocations to produce some errors. However, runtime output of the code below seems to indicate emthreeem additional destructor calls for internal copies made by bind.p  precodeusing namespace std using namespace boost  class M     int somedata public     M somedatanew int[5] coutltltfrom cstrn somedata[1]0     Mcoutltltfrom dstrn delete somedata      int operatorint i coutltltsomedata[i]ltltendl return 0    int main      M instM      bindltintgtinstM,1     bindltintgtampMoperator,ampinstM,1 this works with no errors, of course      instM1 would not change the order of output      return 0  codepre  pThe output ... presents some additional puzzles  eg. why first dstr event comes before call to operator Also notice the 2 before the last failed destructor call. p  precodefrom cstr from dstr 1 from dstr bindcopy73365 malloc  error for object 0x1001b0 double free  set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debug from dstr bindcopy73365 malloc  error for object 0x1001b0 double free  set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debug 2 from dstr bindcopy73365 malloc  error for object 0x1001b0 double free  set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debug codepre  pSo the question is can anyone explain briefly in what order, and what kind of copies does bind makep  p... After some thought I realized bind is simply using the here default copy constructor. After supplying some custom version of this cstr with memory allocation and asdeepasonewishes version of the copy the output gets clean as it should, but the puzzle remains there are emthreeem invocations of the copy constructor. strongSo in this case boostbind makes emthreeem copies of the function object.

Negative 4371 pIs there a logical reason why the following statement from the Hyperspec is the way it is If there is a duplication between list1 and list2, only one of the duplicate instances will be in the result. If either list1 or list2 has duplicate entries within it, the redundant entries might or might not appear in the result.p  pUntil I read this I was assuming that union should return a unique list and frustrated why my code didnt do so. It also seems odd to remove duplicates between lists but not within. Why even specify thisp  pIt seems like one should be able to assume union will produce a unique list of the sets elements or am I missing somethingp  pFor the full page in Hyperspec see a hrefhttpclhs.lisp.seBodyfunionc.htm relnofollowhttpclhs.lisp.seBodyfunionc.htmap

Negative 4371 pIt sounds like this topic has been beaten to death but when you set up a provisioning profile for deployment to test devices, an arbitrarily generated UUID will not suffice, you need the actual UDID to include in the provisioning profile.  Sure, you could give users a set of instructions to go through to get the ID, and email it to you  but it is much more customerfriendly and avoiding stupid mistakes to get it yourself in code  previously via codeuniqueIdentifiercode method.p  pSo other than creating an adhoc UUID, has anyone come up with a good replacement that would work in iOS6, or has Apple provided some method of doing this  I havent been able to find it in the docs.p

Negative 4371 pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pIm new to Java and spring and Id like to know how to structure code which marshals different objects from XML and then processes them. Im converting some code JAVA code from before my time to use spring. I know the way Ive approached this this probably, wrong but If someone could offer a few pointers on how to restructure things the Spring way that would help alot. Ive read a lot of the Spring docs, but Im finding it hard to apply what is in there to my code.p  pstrongThe Situationstrongp  pIm not going to post the whole code tree as even and simple example is a lot of code which is the problem. So Ill just describe the method.p  pIve got XML and schemas for two classes CLASSA amp CLASSB. Ive generated JAVA wrappers using xjc. Ive got a JAVA class which is a wrapper for the JAXB marshaller. The wrapper needs to be given the class name and the package name of the class to be marshalled on construction.p  precodepublic JaxbWrapperString ClassName, String packageName throws ClassNotFoundException, InstantiationException,         IllegalAccessException, JAXBException       this.packageName  packageName               set the context is the expensive operation     setJAXBContextClass.forNamefullJaxbClassNameClassName.newInstance               get the schma from preset schema dir     schemaFileName  findSchemaClassName      myMarsheller  jc.createMarshaller      myMarsheller.setPropertyMarshaller.JAXBFORMATTEDOUTPUT, Boolean.TRUE  codepre  pIve then got one bean for each instance of the JaxBWrapper for both ClassA and ClassB. They are almost identical so only the one for class A is shown.p  precodeltbean idjaxbParserCLASSA classorg.test.JAXB.JaxbWrapper     lazyinittrue scopeprototypegt     ltconstructorarg index0 typejava.lang.String         valueCLASSA gt     ltconstructorarg index1 typejava.lang.String         reftestPackage gt     ltproperty nameencoding refxmlEncoding gt ltbeangt codepre  pUnhelpfully the XML files I have to process are delivered emone at a timeem in file with a fixed name and a rolling counter and I cannot change that. So Im unable to tell what object is in the file from the filename. Ive have a tiny utility function which check which the object type is in the file Im trying to process. p  pI then have the following functionp  precodepublic static Object loadXMLString xmlFile, String fileName throws Exception      InputStream iStream  XmlUtils.openFilexmlFile     String xmlObjectType  XmlUtils.getObjectTypeFromXMLxmlFile              get the right JAXB processor     JaxbWrapper jaxB  myContext.getBeanjaxbParser  xmlObjectType , JaxbWrapper.class     Object  obj  jaxB.objectFromXMLiStream, xmlObjectType , fileName     return obj  codepre  pSo Im taking the object name and getting the right bean from the context. This means I could use things like Springs object pool to hold lots of JaxbWrappers for different objects. However the way Ive implemented this feels wrong to me. I dont like the myContext.getBeanjaxbParser  xmlObjectType method of getting the JaxbWrapper bean. p  pemSo my question is Is there a better way of structuring this code A few simple pointers would be very much appreciated.emp  pstrongAdditional Complexitystrongp  pThis is where things, at the moment, become really unmanageable. Once the marshaling stage has completed Ive got a post processing stage where there are several different post processor emfor eachem class type. Ive got Spring beans for each of these and Im getting them from the application context usingp  precodemyContext.getBeanxmlObjectType    processorType    xmlObjectType codepre  pwherep  ul lixmlObjectType is a string CLASSA or CLASSB which is set by reading the object type from the file as above.li liprocessorType is s string which is set from the comand line. li ul  pTo set the proceesorType Im doing something like the following when the application starts.p  precode    if line.hasOptionfile              processorType  FileProcessor          if line.hasOptionprint              processorType  PrintProcessor      codepre  pAgain, I dont think this is the right way to do things, but Its the best Ive got at the moment .p  pstrongI guess the more general question is how do JAXB and Spring work together In the real world I have lots very large and complex CLASSA and CLASSBs. Ive got java classes for these generated by xjc. As Im using xjc I have to use jaxb I guess. The question is how to do that in the Spring world.strongp  pstrongOr can I get rid of JAXB and use a spring component. Id need to use something else to generate all the classes other than xjc. But I cannot find anything that would perform that taskstrong p

Negative 4371 pI am interested in this question and have tried a couple of things.p  pGenerally one can use products such as a hrefhttpwww.ejtechnologies.comproductsjprofileroverview.html relnofollowJProfilera or a hrefhttpvisualvm.java.net relnofollowVisualVMa to perform a profiling of CPU and search for the methods that under investigation.p  pAlso, one may use libraries such as a hrefhttpjetm.void.fm relnofollowJETMa, a hrefhttpmetrics.codahale.com relnofollowCodaHale Metricsa, or a hrefhttpgithub.comNetflixservo relnofollowNetflix Servoa to introduce measuring points in the application. However, the issue with this approach is that for thirdparty libraries it may not work because the libraries expect you to introduce measuring points inside the application. This is the most interesting approach for me since they are minimal in the amount of code they introduce.p  pLast but not least, one may also use approached based on AOP such as a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringdocscurrentspringframeworkreferencehtmlaop.html relnofollowSpring AOPa to measure specific executions of third party libraries. Since the project is not using AOP at all, Id rather not introduce new dependencies for the only purpose of this measurement.p  pIn my case, for instance, I would like to measure the execution of logging methods such as the mixture of a hrefhttpcommons.apache.orgloggingcommonslogging1.1.1apidocsorgapachecommonsloggingLog.html relnofollowJCL Loga and a hrefhttplogging.apache.orglog4j1.2apidocsorgapachelog4jLogger.html relnofollowlog4j Loggera implementation. I would like to use a a hrefhttpjunit.sourceforge.netjavadocorgjunitrunnernotificationRunListener.html relnofollowJUnit RunListenera with Maven Surefire and measure this execution for all the unit tests that I have. p  pSo, any ideas Id appreciate suggestions.p

Negative 4371 pIm following DCI to structure the behavior of a new Rails application, but I have some doubts about where to put the validations.p  pTraditionally, if youre going to manage your data using ActiveRecord models, validations are defined at the particular class that inherits from AR, and they seem to fit right as part of the data layer.p  pHowever, to my eyes it makes sense to have certain validations that only happens under a specific role, and they should only be checked if the object is on that context, being ignored in all the other cases. Which basically means that those validations should be defined at particular roles, and the object should be extended with those role modules when its being used on the context where it makes sense.p  pDo you think its a good idea to keep those validations at the roles If so, how do you declare them without contaminating the other instances of the same class than the object If I want to use the ActiveRecord validations, they are declared at class level, so I cant attach them to the object individually, being forced to use a redeclaration of the validate instance method on the role module attaching the errors to the errors array of the object directly, or some similar technique.p

Now, this Shell works fine for bincat if I run it in foreground. However, if I type bincat amp to let it run in background, I got an inputoutput error.

If I use bg command to resume it, it will again be stopped by a SIGTTIN.p  pWhat I am confused is how could I implement this. Is SIGTTIN automatically sent by the OS, or I have to send it myself If it is that latter one, how could I tell a child is going to read from the terminal or notp  pThanksp

Negative 4371 pI parse some stuff from a several urls and insert data in database. I want to do this now in parallel. I create a thread pool and run links in separate threads. But it isnt safe.

Negative 4371 pOk, so I know that it is considered bad practice to do any DOM manipulation in a controller when working with AngularJS, you should be using directives and scope for that stuff, but what about event binding  From the looks of it, that is also frowned upon considering all the builtin event directives like ngClick, ngMousedown, ngMouseenter, etc... but if that is the case then I have a piece of code that I dont know how to do the AngularJS way.p  pThe application I am building has infinite scrolling and it is implemented with this piece of code that currently lives in a controllerp  precodedocument.bindscroll, function     ifscope.loadingIssues ampamp window.scrollTop  window.height gt .userfeedbacklist.offset.top  .userfeedbacklist.height          scope.loadIssues       codepre  pThis allows the user to scroll the page and when the pages gets to the bottom of the element that is storing the data that has infinite scrolling, it fires off the function to load more data.  Now I am not doing any DOM manipulation, all the functions just update data attached to the scope and I let AngularJS do the DOM updates but is having this event binding against best practices with AngularJS  If so how would I be able to do this in the AngularJS way I dont think a directive would work in this case since I dont think it is possible to attach a directive to the document objectp

Negative 4371 pi have an C application that is writing status information from a PLC device, the program accepts parameters stored in an XML file with a config editor to edit these parameters, the program checks the Memory address of the PLC using the config file to tell the program the address name and datatype etc.  if the value changes from previous value then we write the status along with fields from the config to a Log.XML, after testing, this didnt seem like the best approach as the file was getting large and using lots of cpu to open the Log to check existing value then log new value if changed.  the question is what is the best approach for storing config data and log data, the log data is getting written to very frequently, Im wondering if SQL CE is better performance, if so shall i store config data in SQL as wellp

Thus, it becomesp  precodelocale  applyfilters pluginlocale, qtransgetLanguage, textdomain codepre  pIf I printrlocale after this line. It shows current language. But not when the form is submitted.

Negative 4371 pstrongUPDATEstrong Martin R below has provided a very clear and succinct answer that emalmostsem answers my question. I suppose I should rephrasep  pCan you think of any reasons why fetching NSManagedObjects that are connected to another NSManagedObject wouldnt work when calling codeprepareForDeletioncode, given that such objects are connected onetoone to the object being deletedp  pI need to be able to call codeprepareForDeletioncode so that I can run some entity checking before deciding whether I should delete an objects children.p  hr  pAre there any tricks to deleting an objects children objects in Core Data when it is a onetoone relationshipp  pI have a rather complex Core Data model wherein deleting a single NSManagedObject should also delete its children NSManagedObjects via codeprepareForDeletioncode. Running a series of debugging NSLog statements immediately prior to deletion reveals that all relationships have been set up properly. However, when actually attempting to delete the object, it seems many though not all of these relationships have been lost, as attempting to fetch some but again, not all of these objects via NSFetchRequest returns empty arrays.p  pI cant seem to figure out any differences between how I fetch the objects that are found versus the objects that are not found, other than that those that are found are inverse tomany relationships while those that cannot be found are onetoone relationships p  pTo delete the main object I simply call code[managedObjectContext deleteObjectmainObject]code, and within the main objects private API I have overwritten codeprepareForDeletioncode as followsp  precode voidprepareForDeletion      [super prepareForDeletion]  commented but uncommenting doesnt change results     [MyDataManager deleteChildOneForMainObjectself]     [MyDataManager deleteChildrenTwoForMainObjectself]     [MyDataManager deleteChildrenThreeForMainObjectself]  codepre  pwhere codeMyDataManagercode is a custom NSObject containing only class methods. MyDataManager then searches for corresponding NSManagedObjects in the managed object context via something akin to the followingp  precode BOOLdeleteChildOneForMainObjectMainObject mainObject      NSFetchRequest fetch  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init]     NSEntityDescription entity  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameChildOne inManagedObjectContextmanagedObjectContext]     [fetch setEntityentity]     [fetch setPredicate[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatmainObject  , mainObject]]     NSError error     NSArray childOnesToDelete  [managedObjectContext executeFetchRequestfetch erroramperror]     if childOnesToDelete.count gt 1              NSLog[WARNING] More than one ChildOne for mainObject found deleting all          NSLog[TEST] Deleting i ChildOnes, childOnesToDelete.count     for ChildOne childOne in childOnesToDelete              [managedObjectContext deleteObjectchildOne]          if [managedObjectContext saveamperror] return YES     else NSLog[WARNING] Save error for function [deleteChildOneForMainObject]     return NO  codepre  pAgain, each NSManagedObject of type MainObject has a onetoone relationship to ChildOne and onetomany relationships with ChildTwo and ChildThree.

The repo exposed to the world at github.com tracks codemastercode while the Github Pages page at myusername.github.com which hosts the live code samples amp test pages that I actually use for testing tracks codeghpagescode. Both should synchronize the important stuff js code and my question is about if it is possible for both to point to the same exact commit. Ignoring, for the moment, that this would mean that codemastercode would receive the extra files for the Pages site that dont really belong there. Still I dont mind having that transparency anyway, so it is simple for folks to figure out how the site is set up.p

Negative 4371 pI am having an issue with updating AppWidgets and a confluence of limitationsbugs in android is preventing me finding a workaround.p  pMy app widget is themeable so I need to be able to update the imageviews on it at runtime as well as the textviews and intents.  There are up to 9 imageviews that I am updating but the size of the graphics Im using are fairly modest max 11kb pngs. The total size of data I am pushing through the RemoteViews object should be under 100kb, well within the limit of 1mb.  I think that actual drawable resources on screen end up being larger in size than the original pngs, but 10 of the limit seems reasonable enough to account for that.  However, with certain phones and launchers, I am getting FAILED BINDER TRANSACTION errors.p  pThere are two solutions that I have found for thisp  p1 Use setImageViewUri which calls setImageURI instead of setImageViewResource with the RemoteViews object, this gets rid of sending drawables through the RemoteViews object and loads the image from URI instead.  Solves the memory error see a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicandroiddevelopersKKEyW6XdDvgdiscussion relnofollowhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicandroiddevelopersKKEyW6XdDvgdiscussiona p  p2 Divide the updates to the app widget into multiple RemoteViews calls.  So I update 3 of the images, call updateAppWidget, create a new RemoteViews object, update the next 3 images, call updateAppWidget, etc.p  pThe problem with the 1st approach is that it only works for medium density devices.  All other devices scale the images incorrectly due to a bug in the android codebase see bug report a hrefhttpcode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid22590 relnofollowhttpcode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid22590a p  pThe problem with the 2nd approach is that when the screen orientation changes, android destroys and recreates widget views using the last RemoteViews call which it stores in some secret place.  This meams the appwidget doesnt get fully redrawn because I split my RemoteView calls up and the widget ends up unusable.  There appears to be no reliable way to figure out when android is destroying and recreating the appwidgets   onConfigurationChanged in the service doesnt always fire and no Activity level call is ever made ie. onUpdate, onReceive that I can find.  In order for the widgets to be able to be redrawn fully and correctly on orientation change, I can only use one RemoteViews updateAppWidget call so this solution wont work.p  pDoes anyone have any idea how to work around this  Im wondering if itd be possible to implement my own RemoteViews that called a nonbuggy setImageURI function in a custom ImageView class so that the scaling happened correctly.  It seems like a lot of work just update a few widgets and I am not sure android will let me extend RemoteViewsImageView that way.p  pIs there anyway to intercept android when the screen orientation changes and force it to redraw the whole widgetp  pWould love to hear any other suggestions or workaround ideas  Thanks.p
Negative 4371 pSo first I was getting myself used to Matlab FFT, for example I would do the followingp  precode    clc          fs  4         t  01fs11fs          x1  sin2pit          y1  fftx1,n         FTpower1  absy11floorn2.2         FTphase1 angley11floorn2  180pi         [c1,i1]  maxFTpower1         phase1  FTphase1i1 codepre  pAnd I think I have a decent understanding of why use Nyquist and sampling frequency parameter. However now, I am suppose to do the same procedure on an array of output that is sinusoidal coming from a different subroutine I have, which means my output array has 2 columns, the first is for the time vector and the second is the actual sinusoidal response. Now, how to incorporate the fs parameter I am confused all the sudden. Please let me know if you need more details. Thank you.p

Now, in the case that a user wanted to save the name, I will have a second button that will call a PHP mail action to email the name.  Before I add the mail function, Im just trying to store the variable somewhere so that I can alert it and validate that I have control over it.

Negative 4371 pI have implemented a background service that queries the database every 5 seconds. If the query returns no results, the service should wait for 5 seconds and query database again. If the query returns results, it should call an activity and pass the results to it. p  pI started with an AsyncTask which basically reads the database in the doInBackground and returns the results, so that the onPostExecute calls the activity. Right now I am calling the AsyncTask.execute in the onStartCommand of the service.

In fact, the note field just prints out the border and nothing else looks like a white empty div with a border and the signature field prints out everything but the actual signature. When I use google chrome to save the document as a PDF and then print it out directly from the PDF everything prints perfect. When I use firefox to print, the signature area prints perfect, but the note problem remains of it only printing the outter border.p  pI would greatly appreciate any suggestions on how to begin to fix this or any input on why this may be happening.p  pMany thanks in advancep  pimg srchttpi44.tinypic.comb4ephw.png p
Negative 4371 pIve been thinking about this off and on and did a quick test with Facebook. Assume you have a Facebook like site and strip it down to images and profiles. Images you choose to either share with friends or not to. Obviously in the DB there are values applied on the metadata if it is shared or not, with whom it is shared, ect. p  pNow say I view a particular image, so I now have an HTTPS URL for that resource an image in this example. At that point, the resource can be viewed without logging in or having a token of any sort. You have the URL, load it into any browser and you see that resource. Granted, it is provided in an SSL layer and they have fairly long, complex names, but I can view it without authenticating.  p  pI cant help but think, is this the best that can be done Can this type of content be secured so if you have a direct URL you cannot load it What about files that may be more sensitive If someone has a path can they forever now access that resource Can OAuth be of any help in this casep  pI guess Im just thinking out loud about how these resources can be secured, so that if I hit a URL directly I will not always get that resource without being authenticated. Is there another process or method that I may be missing If so what is the right balance between performance and security and what are the tradeoffs Would like to look into options that are scalable.p

Negative 4371 pIm going back and forth with this, so I figured Ill ask here. Im hoping for a single technique that will work for all input fields text, select, textarea.p  ol lipFirst we process user input using php script. There could be some validation errors so form may need to be redisplayed with user entered values. codehtmlspecialcharsfieldValue, ENTQUOTEScode doesnt work here because if there is a validation error and form is redisplayed, all quotes entered by user are converted to . At least in a text area.pli lipOnce the form is validated successfully, we need to send input to the database. Column values need to be safe so some conversion is required. I understand I may need to apply some form of conversion when reading from database, as well, although I hope to be wrong on this one.pli ol  pLooking for a good practice that does not involved too much code. p  pp  pJust as an update. In a Domino form, there is no escaping of any kind and no special processing is required. Notes just does it for it automagically. In a Java application that uses JPA, all of this safety is handled automagically, as well. I understand that php may not have the equivalent but this is such a common issue that I choose to believe Im missing some very simple solution to this.p

When the file is huge, this is not really a big deal, though we can still see it takes some percent instantly and then start to percent slower. On slow connections, sending a 60KB file result in showing a progress bar that goes instantly to 100 but the actual upload is not completed at all, so we cant really display whats going on.p  pI did a complete showcase that exposes the problem on Monotouch iOS, the link is available below a hrefhttpsgithub.comrFlexMonotouchUploadShowcase relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrFlexMonotouchUploadShowcaseap  pThis is where the interesting stuff is a hrefhttpsgithub.comrFlexMonotouchUploadShowcaseblobmasterTestUploadUploader.cs relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrFlexMonotouchUploadShowcaseblobmasterTestUploadUploader.csap

Negative 4371 pIm working on the firmware of a device that its going to be connected to PCs using Bluetooth in serial port emulation mode.p  pDuring testing, I found out that modemmanager on Linux helpfully tries to detect it as a modem, sending the codeATGCAPcode command to this, currently my device replies with something like codeINVALIDCMD ATGCAPcode.

Negative 4371 pIve got a stored procedure that contains a trycatch block.  In the catch block I call raiserror to rethrow the error with some context.p  pI was expecting that if an error occurred the raiserror would be called and execution would immediately return from the stored procedure to the calling code.  However, this doesnt appear to be the case.

Negative 4371 pI am learning android programming, and am having problems with up navigation in master  detail fragments.  For practice, I am putting together an application to track sheet music by composer for my wifes choirs library of sheet music.  Pretty esoteric, but if I can get it working, Ill have a better understanding of Android programming.p  pThe first screen is a listing of Composers.  Selecting one from the list displays details about the composer in the detail fragment this is working fineanddandy.p  pI have the detail fragment being created like this  Straight from the template provided by eclipsep  precodeIn ComposerListActivity.java public void onItemSelectedString id      if mTwoPane           In twopane mode, show the detail view in this activity by          adding or replacing the detail fragment using a          fragment transaction.

Pressing that button brings up another Master  Detail Activityp  precode    In ComposerDetailFragment.java     protected void viewPieces          Intent intent  new Intentthis.getActivity, PieceListActivity.class         intent.putExtraCOMPOSERID, this.dataObject.getId         this.getActivity.startActivityForResultintent, VIEWPIECESLIST      codepre  pThis works fine, and shows the list of pieces written by that composer.  You can select one of the pieces and it shows information about that piece title, number of parts, key, number of pages, etc.  If I press back from the pieces, it takes me back to the list of composers with the previouslyselected composer selected.  However, if I press up on the icon in the action bar, it takes me to an activity showing a blank detail fragment the id of the composer is lost.  I would expect in this case that back and up should function the same  they both should go up one level for the list of pieces to the list of composers.  On a phone, however, it should do what its doing except retaining the composer id, but that is a separate issue I suspect.  p  precodeIn PieceListActivity.java public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item      switch item.getItemId      case android.R.id.home          This ID represents the Home or Up button. In the case of this          activity, the Up button is shown. Use NavUtils to allow users          to navigate up one level in the application structure.

Negative 4371 pThis situation has me a little stumped. I created a web service when I write an application and consume it with like Add Service Reference, I am able to put in the URL and all.

Negative 4371 pI was wondering if anyone could help me with a problem. As title suggests, i need to bind linq query, that returns an anonymous typeor collection of anonymous types to datagridview, so that it gets updated, whenever there is a change in datacontext. I use WinForms, and .NET 4. Lets assume a very basic example, because i cant get even that to work.p  precode... var query  from x in Program.context.Products             select new               x.ID, x.name              BindingSource source  new BindingSourcequery, null dataGridview1.DataSource  source  private void bttn1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e      Product p Program.context.Products.Singlex gt x.ID  1     p.name  asdf     Program.context.SubmitChanges  codepre  pProblem is, when I click the button, grid doesnt update. I know that in THIS instance, i dont really need to use anonymous type, but my actual query isnt as easy, and it joins values from multiple tables. Ive already checked google, found a similar thread here, but it wasnt quite what i was looking for, as OP only needed values from 1 table. Thanks in advance for any reply.p  pEDIT p  pIt turns out my google research skills are as bad as my coding. My question was already answered on another threadp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4065627bindingdatagridviewtoamultipletablelinqtosqlqueryrq1Binding datagridview to a multiple table linqtosql queryap  pThats basicly was Gert Arnold was suggesting, and it works great.

Negative 4371 pCatchall traits classes like codestditeratortraitscode are useful by separating the properties of a type from its definition, so for example the properties may be made available before the definition is complete.p  pDefining traits in addition to each client class itself is inconvenient, because the traits typically also have a place as members. This is why the generic implementation of codestditeratortraitscode is defined in terms of its template arguments members.p  precodetemplatelt typename it gt struct iteratortraits      typedef typename itcategory category     typedef typename itvaluetype valuetype      etc  codepre  pIsnt it easier, and less work for the compiler, to use inheritance insteadp  precodetemplatelt typename t gt struct ttraits  public t      ttraits  delete  Prevent runtime instances.  codepre  pThis fails to document the interface in the primary template, but there are other opportunities for that anyway.p  pIt seems pointless to write lots of repetitive code to define a metacontainer class, in an idiom which doesnt even guarantee prevent such abuse as creation at runtime.p  hr  pOr maybe thats entirely backwards. In addition to codestditeratortraitscode we also have codestditeratorcode, a pseudoabstract base class with mostly the same members. Such redundancy is a code smell. Wouldnt it be better if custom iterators looked like thisp  precodetemplateltgt struct iteratortraitslt struct myiterator gt      typedef randomaccessiteratortag category     typedef foo valuetype     ...  struct myiterator  iteratortraitslt struct myiterator gt      ...  codepre  pFor the sake of argument, lets ignore the fact that an actual codestditeratortraitscode specialization must be declared in codenamespace stdcode. Im trying to make a familiar illustration of something that might happen in user code.p  pThis is cleaner in that the idiom need not be violated to handle whatever exceptional case necessitated the fancy footwork in the first place. Instead of the primary traits template producing an internal error that the missing client class is unsuitable for something, there need not be any primary traits template at all.p  pIts conceptually better to separate qualities of a class from implementation of its services, regardless of whether that separation is necessary. BUT, this style does require breaking every client class into two pieces, including an explicit specialization, which is sort of ugly.p  hr  pIs anyone familiar with this design space Im leaning toward the second idiom, although it looks unusual in practice. But there are probably ins and outs known to those who have trod here before.p

Negative 4371 pI have a data set as presented at the bottom of the post. The data has four columns called, SIC, AT95Group, AT95Mean, AT95Med. The column AT95Group takes on four values such as 00, 01, 11, and 10. Currently, for each SIC, we have four rows for each value of AT95Group. I want to reshape the data frame in a way so that, each SIC has only one row. While earlier we had two columns called mean and med for each SIC, AT95Group pair, we want to create essentially 42 columns 4 for group 00,11,01,10 and 2 for Mean, and Med.

Unfortunately, I wasnt able to find the correct configuration of the control to stop it from rendering itself with these useless styles and classes, so Im forced to remove them by hand.

Negative 4371 pIm handling a lot of different image formats within my application. Luckily I was able to source out the biggest part of dealing with image formats to CWPF. However, Ive got an issue when saving imagesp  pId like to save my images as JPEGs using JpegBitmapEncoder with an RGB profile. This works all fine for color image formats. However, when handling images i.e. of format Gray16 or Gray8, the resulting JPEGs will have a Grayscale profile. I really do need an RGB profile for my JPEGsp  pI know that I could just create a new WriteableBitmap in Bgra32, copy to it the data and use it to create the JPEG. This however means, that I would need to handle the different image formats myself. Most importantly I believe that this detour would be quite inefficient computationally I need to convert a lot of image data.p  pAlso I cant use any solutions outside of CWPF like Imagemagick.p  pI hope that theres a way to solve this easily and efficiently. I found no way to configure JpegBitmapEncoder for this and I had a try with ColorConvertedBitmap but to no availp  pAny ideasp

Negative 4371 pI would like to implement a database which consists of 2 tables, number and receivernumber. In fact, I have 2 xml files, one using number table, another using receivernumber. However, the code below only allows the first table to be used for both of the xmls. p  pPreviously, I have tried implementing 2 different sets of class files, as stated below. But it crashes the entire app instead. So I tried changing to using the same class file with the receivernumber table being number2 instead. Now, both of the activityxml file uses the first database but not the second. Please advice. Thanks in advance. p  pNote there are no error logs available as it is working. Just that the table used for both activities are the same, but its supposed to be different.p  pSetnumberstoforward.javap  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List  import com.example.awkwardpandaredirectcall.DBAdapter import com.example.awkwardpandaredirectcall.CallAdapter  import android.os.Bundle import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.widget.ArrayAdapter import android.widget.EditText import android.widget.LinearLayout import android.widget.ListView import android.app.Activity import android.app.AlertDialog import android.content.Context import android.content.DialogInterface import android.database.Cursor  public class Setnumberstoforward extends Activity   Context mContext ArrayAdapterltStringgt adapter ListltStringgt adapterData   Called when the activity is first created.

Negative 4371 pI am reading some master data from a third party accounting application which returns XML. My app sends request on a port on which the third party app is listening and receives the response as XML. There are different types of master data which I am reading, like Employee, BankAccount, etc. There are 2030 different types of masters.p  pI need to parse the XML and fill the data in .NET objects. I am wondering how can I reduce my coding effort.p  pI need to design .NET class for each type of master, and then write parsing methods to parse the XML responses and populate the .NET objects. Since there are 2030 types of masters each having its own set of fields, this looks like too much work for such boilerplate type of code.p  pAny ideas how I can reduce my coding effort while still getting the benefits of Object Oriented Programming and compile time checking, Intellisense features, etcp  pYou can assume that the XML follows a certain pattern, like                                ...     p  pHow will the code know which XML Tag has to be parsed into which method or property of the C object Please note that I am not looking for code generators. I want that based on the XML returned, the code should intelligently identify which fields to be populated, as the no. of fields returned in the XML response may vary, and new fields may get introduced in future versions of the third party accounting application.p  pMay be its not possible what I am trying to achievep  pEDIT 1 May be any external mapping information or may be as an embedded resource  which XML tag has to be populated into which class property... But how to implement itp

Negative 4371 pI was able to pass ordinary objects to kernel functions as a copy. However, when I added virtual inheritance to the class hierarchy, I got an error message saying that classes with userdefined copy constructor cannot be used as arguments for kernel launch. However, I dont have userdefined copyconstructor. So I guess it is because the internal implementation of virtual inheritance implemented some different type of copyconstructor. Can someone explain how is virtual inheritance actually implemented and is there any workaround, or is there absolutely no way to use virtual inheritance when writing cuda codep  pThe code is like thisp  precodeclass Base ... class ChildA public virtual Base ... class ChildB public virtual Base ... class GrandChild public ChildA, public ChildB ...  global void mykernelBase x ...  int main    GrandChild x   mykernelltltlt1,1gtgtgtx   return 0  codepre  pEDIT Here is my guess I think nvcc allows only the default copyconstructor because in that case it can simply use a cudaMemcpyAsync to push the arguments into the call stack inside the device. So it hardcoded the compiler such that only default copyconstructors are allowed, yet objects with virtual inheritance internally has a different type of copyconstructor, which triggered the error in nvcc. However, I still believe there should be an easy way that nvcc could have allowed it, providing that nvcc supports virtual functions and other advanced C features.p

Negative 4371 pWe are using service oriented architecture, and have a multithreaded application which serves requests. These requests need to read certain values from a large object that is shared across all the threads and must be periodically refreshed by reading it from the database say, with a frequency of once per day.p  pThe periodic refresh of this large object can possibly take a few minutes and our service must still continue to serve requests using the older cached value of the object. In other words, we do not want to block requests until we have the most updated value of the object.p  pWe are thinking of doing the followingp  pA daemon thread can read the database and reconstruct the object into a new variable. Later, the reference of the new object can be copied onto the variable holding the previously cached object. However, we are unsure whether the copying of the reference can be said to be reasonably threadsafe operation we dont need it to be completely thread safe.p  pIn other words, if a daemon thread updates shared variable A as follows without locking itp  pA  Bp  pAt that time, if another thread attempts to read A, will it always read only the new or the old value of A both are acceptable scenarios for us or can it possibly end up reading some garbage value  If we expressly need to lock A, then the latencies of our requests could go up.p  pAny other suggestions are also welcome.p  pThanksp

Negative 4371 pIn my payment processing service I have two different webservice calls. First call to get customers details and second call to payment gateway service for payment processing.  These calls are not dependant on each other and can be called in any order.p  pPayment gateway call configured with 30 seconds timeout and customer detail call with 10 seconds. Currently calling them synchronously takes 40 seconds 30  10.p  pI want these calls to be made asynchronously for the performance reason. Calling them asynchronously will save 10 seconds processing as when payment gateway is processing the concurrent call to the customer details could be completed in the mean time.p  pHow to implement this in java elegantlyp

Ive upgraded to 1.8.1 but have an issue with showing the price  it stops rendering the page.p  pI have found the line thats causing the issuep  precodeparenttoHtml codepre  pThe class that is calling that is as followsp  precodeclass OrganicInternetSimpleConfigurableProductsCatalogBlockProductPrice extends MageCatalogBlockProductPrice      public function toHtml          Do some stuff        return parenttoHtml       codepre  pSo as I see it, the parent class should be MageCatalogBlockProductPrice. And the line that calls this should simply call the function toHtml. Taking this line out means it works, but returns no price.

Negative 4371 pSorry for asking such a basic question, I have just come across Vaadin, it looks like a interesting way of creating web applications.    I am very out of date of what the state of the art is these days, having last worked on web applications with classic ASP.NET, but do know about ASP.MVC.p  pAs my background is C and .NET I mostly get to work on systems that have a very large code base in C, so just jumping ship to Java is not a good option.p

Negative 4371 pRight, the situation is as followsp  pWe have developed an app that checks the location of the user every 510 minutes for location specific content. To do so, Ive created a Service to stick to the background so it can update even when the app isnt directly in the foreground in which a LocationController is created to check the latest known location. When its finished, it cleans up and the location is sent to a database which is a necessity for this concept.p  pThis all works fine, as long as I check the location with GPSPROVIDER. However, when I switch it around to NETWORKPROVIDER, it may check the location once more before dying completely.p  pIve tried multiple options to prevent this problem, but nothing seems to be working with the update service when I swap that 1 setting.p  pHere are a few snippets which should be relevant to the servicep  pUpdateServicep  precode Override public void onCreate      super.onCreate     Log.dDebug, Created service     PowerManager mgr  PowerManagergetSystemServiceContext.POWERSERVICE     wakeLock  mgr.newWakeLockPowerManager.PARTIALWAKELOCK, MyWakeLock     wakeLock.acquire     IntentFilter filter  new IntentFilter     filter.addActionUPDATEACTION    Override public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId       Log.dStarting, Starting Service      mNotificationManager  NotificationManager getSystemServiceNOTIFICATIONSERVICE     mAlarmManager  AlarmManager this.getSystemServiceContext.ALARMSERVICE      Intent i  new IntentUPDATEACTION     alarmManagerPendingIntent  PendingIntent.getBroadcastthis, 0, i, 0     alarmManagerPendingIntent.cancel     mAlarmManager.cancelalarmManagerPendingIntent      mAlarmManager.setInexactRepeatingAlarmManager.ELAPSEDREALTIMEWAKEUP,                 AlarmManager.INTERVALFIFTEENMINUTES,                 AlarmManager.INTERVALFIFTEENMINUTES,                  alarmManagerPendingIntent      mLocationController  new LocationControllerthis, this      updateHandler  new Handler      return STARTSTICKY  codepre  pLocationControllerp  precodeprivate LocationListener locationListener  new LocationListener      private boolean didSendLocation     public void onLocationChangedLocation location          mLastLocation  location         mCallback.locationUpdatelocation,false         didSendLocation  true           public void onStatusChangedString provider, int status, Bundle extras          Log.dDebug, Status changed status         Location lastLocation  mLocationManager.getLastKnownLocationLocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER         Log.dDebug, Last location lastLocation          ifdidSendLocation                       mCallback.locationUpdatelastLocation,false                  didSendLocation  false           public void onProviderEnabledString provider          Log.dDebug, Provider Enabled           public void onProviderDisabledString provider          Log.dDebug, Provider disabled        public LocationControllerContext mContext, LocationControllerCallback callback      this.mContext  mContext     mCallback  callback     Log.dDebug, Created LocationController     mLocationManager  LocationManager mContext.getSystemServiceContext.LOCATIONSERVICE     mLocationManager.requestLocationUpdatesLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER, 300000, 100, locationListener     mLastLocation  mLocationManager.getLastKnownLocationLocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER      mCallback.locationUpdatemLastLocation,true  codepre  pSo, the code works as it is now, but when I swapp  precodemLocationManager.requestLocationUpdatesLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER, 300000, 100, locationListener codepre  pwithp  precodemLocationManager.requestLocationUpdatesLocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER, 300000, 100, locationListener codepre  pIt will no longer update.

Negative 4371 pI understand that when it comes to C for embedded systems e.g C for PIC MCUs, there are limitations on what set of standard C we can use which also depends on what compiler we use since there are so many out there for different microcontroller families. There are also things done in C in this case that we normally would not do e.g add many assembly instructions to access registers directly, constrain location of function or variable to a specific location in memory e.t.c.p  pWhere can I find a list of things that are specific to embedded C It could be a book or website link. I understand that style of program for an embedded system differs e.g for PIC MCUs we cannot use recursive programming.p

Negative 4371 pI have a unit test that is failing and Im unsure why. I want to be able to see all invocations on the mock that occur in the System Under Test. This is not the behavior that I want for all tests always, simply for a test that I need to quickly tweak to be able to figure out whats wrong.p  pHowever, it seems kind of like a hack. strongIs it possible to do this natively in Mockito, without having to use codeThread.currentThread.getStackTracecodestrongp  pThis is not preferred, because the stack trace includes all the other invocations used internally by Mockito.p

Negative 4371 pI have a thread that shows stopwatch like decreasing time. This thread counts 1 minute. In this one minute, the user has to answer a question. If the user answers the question before the completion of one minute, then next question is shown to him and the thread is reset to count 1 minute. p  pThe Problem I am facing is, when I make a call to reStartTimeKeeper, then the timer restarts but it starts to count faster. And every subsequent call to it, further increases the speed of the counter. I mean, after 1st call to reStartTimeKeeper, my timmer counts 60 secs in 30 secs approx and after 2nd call to reStartTimeKeeper, my timmer counts 60 secs in 15 secs approx. and so on.p  pThe reason for this is when I set QuestionTime1 in reStartTimeKeeper, the 1st instance of the Thread is paused. It continually executes the while loop, as if it is waiting for the condition in the while to become true. p  pWhen I try to initiate the second instance of the thread, I set QuestionTime60. This initiates the new instance of the thread. And doing this also activates the dormant 1st instance which was waiting for while condition to become true.p  pI just want 1 instance of my thread at any instance of time. I made it a static variable. Doing this also has no effect. p  precode        int QuestionTime1         static Thread timeKeeper         Handler mHandler  new Handler         void StartTimeKeeper                          QuestionTime60             timeKeeper  new Threadnew Runnable                  Override                 public void run                      while QuestionTime1                                               mHandler.postnew Runnable                                                       Override                             public void run                                                               QuestionTime                                 UpdateUI                                                                                try                                                       Thread.sleep1000                                                   catch InterruptedException e                                                        e.printStackTrace                                                                                         timeKeeper.start           void reStartTimeKeeper  QuestionTime0 whileQuestionTime1 StartTimeKeeper  codepre  pIf some one can me sync this flow it would be great And if you find any thing silly or some suggestion for improvement, it would be most welcome.

There are still lots of bugs in the code though for example, if you move left while there is a solid object left of you but it is lower than the left bump point, you pass right through it.

Negative 4371 pwe have a question about the behavior of DNS propagation for subdomains.p  pHeres the scenario we are trying to achievep  pUser1 registers at our site company.com. A subdomain user1.company.com is automatically created, not as addon domain of company.com, but as standalone account in WHM.p  pSo, an own zone is being created amp an A record is being set same IP as company.com NS records are also set to ns1.domain2.com  ns2.domain2.com, our own nameservers no clustering, 2 different IPs, BIND method, they are provided for the moment by the same WHM installation as for company.com amp subdomains Domain2.com is handled by our registrar GoDaddy, nameservers ns1  ns2 are also defined there.p  pOur problem is that right after the creation the domain user1.company.com is not immediately accessible unlike an addon domain.p  pWhen we nslookup for example the new domain user1.company.com with the nameservers from our ISP, right after its creation, we get Nonexistent domain. Then, after 115 minutes, and depending on the DNS we try, the nslookup answers with the correct IP address. The DNS from Google 8.8.8.8 for example immediately answers with the correct IP address.p  pWhat exactly happens when the user tries to access his subdomain user1.company.com Are our nameservers contacted to resolve the subdomain or are the subdomains somehow propagated across the DNS servers worldwide But why does Googles DNS answer immediately, propagation cant be so fastp  pAny ideas where may be the problem and how to make a subdomain account accessible immediately after its creation, regardless of the DNS being used by the userp  pMany thanksp  pMarc p

Negative 4371 pWe currently use a number of extension methods in our C application for converting a generic dataset to a stronglytyped object using LINQ. The main purpose is that the extension method can log an error if there is some casting type issue or other exception. p  pWe are trying to convert this code to VB.NET application but the Module to expose an extension method to the DataRow object doesnt work.

Negative 4371 pI am being hounded to make a Delphi VCL form configurable so that different users will tab through fields in different orders and have access to different fields. I keep telling everyone that this is a BAD IDEA but they simply arent hearing anything that they dont want to hear.p  pMy question is thisp  pIs there an existing Delphi component that will allow me to do this without having to have OnEnter  OnExit events for every field on the form Ideally the component would also intercept KeyPress events to allow for the Tab  ShftTab problem.p  pI have tried to do this on a limited basis in the past and found to be a nightmare so any suggestions that might make my life easier are appreciated. p
Negative 4371 pI have created an FMX component that is a button array. This has a simple column and row count property. Each of the buttons in the array is a component itself and when the row or column count is changed I delete all of the buttons and recreate the number needed.p  pThe problem I have is that after removing the components they continue to ghost on screen. For example the default column and row count is 10 but for phone format I change this at design time to 5 x 5.

Negative 4371 pIve got the following setup I use several TI MSP430F5529 Launchpads with the Anaren AIR Boosterpack Basically just a CC110L that communicate with each other, one of them being connected to a computer via UART.p  pNow, sometimes every few thousand packages or so, randomly, not really reproduceable one of the transcievers not reproduceable refuces to accept packages. When looking at the SPI communication I see that the GDO0 pin goes high, as it should, but when requesting the number of bytes in the RXFIFO the transciever returns 0. The status byte i get is 16, meaning that the transciever is in RX mode but the RXFIFO is empty as opposed to 31  16 RX Mode  15 15 or more bytes available.p  pI currently suspect that the transciever rejects the package on hardware level meaning e.g. a failed CRC check  BUT all the other nodes with identical hardware and identical software are able to recieve the package, and so isare the nodes in question after a reset.p  pAs far is i see it, none of the problems mentioned in the errata sheet fit the description  any ideasp  pCheers, Davidp

Negative 4371 pWindows 7 platform, .NET 4.0 application using NamedPipes for samemachine IPC.

After the pipe has got a client connected, they start sending large traffic two ways. Reading data is done using BeginReadEndRead, writing is done on a dedicated thread using blocking Write call. Everything works great while the messages size is less or equal to 128Kb. If a message size is greater say 256K, somethimes the servers async read does not respond. Client says it has written all data to the pipe, but server does not receive OnReadEnd callback despite BeginRead is 100 invoked which is confirmed by debugger. Note that the test does work for some amount of data sent twoways, but suddenly blocks on a certain portion of data message.p  pI checked Chromium project to see how they use namedpipes for IPC. They do support messages up to 128Mb as per source code. The only differences native C vs .NET4 and Message mode vs Byte mode. Another OSS project Named Pipes Wrapper written in C see GitHub claims it can handle messages up to 300Mb and it also uses Byte mode.p  pSummarizing, I suspect the problem is related to Message transmission mode. And IOCP fails to notify my server app that next portion arrived. Worth to mention also, the reading is done by blocks equal to Pipes IO buffer size 128Kb in my case.p  pQuestion have you ever noticed any issues related to using Message transmission mode when working with NamedPipes. No matter was that a .NET or native app.p  pThanksp

Negative 4371 pGNU Make includes a special target called code.DELETEONERRORcode.

Negative 4371 pShort version Is there any simple way how to find out if the JPG file is CMYK or RGB in Delphi XE Preferably without any additional libraries...p  pLonger version I have a 3rd party library that accepts JPEG. But for whatever reason the library needs to know whether they are in CMYK or RGB colorspace. And what is worse it renders the CMYK ones with wrong colors probably something with CMS or so.... Delphi itself TJPEGImage displays the CMYK image correctly but it seems that all the CMYK vs RGB stuff is hidden in jpeg.pas implementation section and is not published...p  pI searched a lot of stuff on the Internet but here I found only few years old posts. Also Ive found Gabriel Corneanus modified jpeg.dcu but it is all about making Delphi load the image correctly. And it seems that XE does load the CMYK JPEGs correctly. p  pIn the end I would prefer to convert the CMYK image to RGB and even as it sounds horrible I do not mind doing it by recoding the JPEG if there is no other better option. Basically load it to bitmap and save the bitmap as JPEG if needed...p  pP.S. I would like to avoid bringing another libraries to my project as much as possible and I would like to stay within standard Delphi as much as possible so if I ever need to move this project to Mac, iOS or Android I do not have to deal with a lot of external stuff...p

I checked the connection instance using my debugger and found that nothing was changed to my Url.p  pI checked the Url that was crafted in the code using a chrome addin that allows me to add payload to POST requests. That works correct. I logged off my Trello dialog before to avoid confusement with authentication issues.p  pSo In the Url the key and the permanent token are in place. Using a HttpsURLConnection, it fails with a 404. When I use the same Url with a RESTdialog, then it works correct.p  pAs a trial and suggested in other questions, I moved the POST payload textcomment of a card to the Url Same result.p  pAny ideap  pSOLVEDp  pThe problem was solved by a very smart Elancer Yuriy T. He assumed my use case and found out that one Trello user was making comments on a card owned by another Trello user. The Trello API forces a POST in this particular case. I wrongly used a PUT in my code. That solved the mystery. A hint for those who use their browser tools rather than reading the API p

Negative 4371 pI am trying to sort my results grid based on a default column header every time the results gets displayed. I tried giving a sorter to the store and it worked fine when the page loads first time. Its working as I want it to be. But the problem arises only when I try to click on a different column header in the grid. When I click on a different header it sorts based on that particular column values. If I click on search button at this point of time without reloading the page, the search results get displayed and are sorted based on my previous selected column. I want this to be sorted based on the default column. Problem is the grid gets refreshed with search results every time I click on search or reset buttons but the column headers are not getting refreshed. So the results are getting sorted based on my previous selection. To fix this problem, I am trying to reload the whole page every time I click on search or reset. Is there a way that I can refresh the column headers along with the search results every time I click on the search so that the results get sorted based on the default column header. I am able to refresh the search results and the pagination part for every search but not the column headers. Any solution...p  pThanks....p

Negative 4371 pI am using the code below to sort a spreadsheet with various subtotals. On  5 out of 6 spreadsheets it works as expected. On the 6th spreadsheet I have encountered a problem with Excel ungrouping one row from a sub group.  In the example below row 435 is removed from the rest of the group and row 436 has its height reduced to 0.  I have looked at every cell in rows  435 and 436 and each matches the other rows in the group.  After speaking with the users who would manually record a sorting macro they told me it sometimes happens to their spreadsheets as well.  this macro works for the first 27 groups it has to sort.

If I bind the row to the Column property for testing purposes, it build it correctly but my buttons are displayed on different rows which is not what I want. I want each button to be aligned horizontally.p  pHow can I achieve this I know I could just hard code 3 buttons and just change their icons and text and handle the relevant code by passing the relevant button as binded parameter, but ideally Id like to build the buttons dynamically in a grid and position them using the column.p  pNote that the number of column would be fixed i.e. 3, as Ill never have more than this.p  pThanks.p

Negative 4371 pI am writing a simple bash debugging tool, codelognextlinecode. The intended behavior is when the codelogcode variable is defined it reads next line of the script, expand variables on it, writes it to the file specified by codelogcode, executes the command, and capture its output to the same log.p  pI have the problem with the variable expansion. Suppose I have a line of bash code in variable codelinecode. How to expand the strings in it without executing any external programs, and without executing pipes which is dangerousp  pThe simple codelineecho linecode doesnt work at all.  When I try codelinebash c echo linecode I have better luck, but then I need to export ALL bash variables to the spawned bash which I have no idea how to do.

If you declare a cursor with all the default options, does it default to codeFORWARDONLY DYNAMICcode cursor Here is the snippet from MSFT documentationp  blockquote   pFORWARDONLYbr   Specifies that the cursor can only be scrolled from the first to the last row. FETCH NEXT is the only supported fetch option. strongIf FORWARDONLY is specified without the STATIC, KEYSET, or DYNAMIC keywords, the cursor operates as a DYNAMIC cursor.strong When neither FORWARDONLY nor SCROLL is specified, strongFORWARDONLY is the defaultstrong, unless the keywords STATIC, KEYSET, or DYNAMIC are specified. STATIC, KEYSET, and DYNAMIC cursors default to SCROLL. Unlike database APIs such as ODBC and ADO, FORWARDONLY is supported with STATIC, KEYSET, and DYNAMIC TransactSQL cursors.p blockquote  pSo putting these 2 bolded statements together, is my assumption correctp  pThanksp

Negative 4371 pThe question can be general, but suppose that Django is used to provide RESTful APIs consumed by an application written in AngularJS.p  pBoth applications need some configuration variables, some of those shared between the two. For example, both of them need to know the list of holidays of the current year. For Django, one can write this list in the codesettings.pycode file or as a constant in the codeModelcode class. For AngularJS, it is possible to write a codeServicecode or a codeFactorycode that can be dependency injected where needed.p  pHow to avoid this duplication That is, how do I write the list a single time Instead of hard coding the variables in an AngularJS Factory, they can be loaded via an Ajax request, as the application is loaded on the client, that is as the codeFactorycode is created.p  pA second option can be a JSON file that can be parsed in Django and loaded in AngularJS.p  pWhich is the customary wayp  pWhat about functions Suppose that in the AngularJS application I have a cart with a function that calculates in real time, as I tweak the content of the cart, the total price based on objects, quantities, and whatever complex relations one can think of. I dont want to make an Ajax request to ask the backend for the computation of the total price.p  pI finally send the content of the cart to the backend via the RESTful API I created with Django. Of course I dont want to send the total price in the call the user could send any total price, but I want to calculate it again from the backend side.p  pAre there any options to write the function to calculate the total price only oncep

Negative 4371 pI want to build a mobile app that requires the number of the user to be filled in. After that, the phone number is sent to a server, the server generates a random verification code that corresponds to this phone number. Then, this verification code is sent via SMS to the user. Next, the user sends the verification code back to the server to ensure that heshe has entered hisher real phone number and not anybodys else. p  pI was wondering how do you really authenticate against the server if you only have a phone number and nothing else I mean, in the typical scenario you have a username and a password that are checked on the server and if both of them are correct you can have access to the server. But in the case of a phonenumber registration, you have only a phone number and if you authenticate with it only, it means that anyone who knows your number or just picks it out, can pretend to be you. p  pIf you send some sort of a unique device ID, that means that you wont be able to use your existing account anymore, for example, if you happen to change your device with a new one.p  pSo, how do you solve this issue p

Keeping that data constant after a paycheck is processed is critical. p  pI considered the use of delegates, but Im not so sure thats my answer either, as I still wouldnt be able to develop the desired methods outside of the Paycheck class.p  pIs there something Im not thinking of or is this a you cant have your cake and eat it too kind of situation p

Negative 4371 pIm banging my head on this, but, frankly speaking, my brains wont get it  or so it seems.p  pI have a column family that holds jobs for a rather large group of actors. It is a central job management and scheduling table that must be distributed and available throughout the whole cluster and possibly even traverses datacenter barriers some day in the near future.p  pEach job executor actor system, the ones that actually execute the jobs, is installed alongside one Cassandra node  that is, on the same node. Actually of course there is s master actor that pulls the jobs and distributes them to the actor agents, but that has nothing to do with my question. p  pThere are also some actor systems that can create jobs in the central job table to be executed by other actors or even actor systems, but usually the jobs are loaded batch wise or manually through a web interface.p  pAn actor that is to execute a job always only queries its local cassandra node. If finished, it will update the job table to indicate it is finished. This write should, in normal circumstances, also only update records with jobs, for which his local Cassandra node is authoritative.p  pNow, sometimes it may happen that an actor system on a given host has nothing to do. In this case it should indeed get jobs from other nodes too, but of course it will still only talk to its local Cassandra node. I know this works and it doesnt bother me a bit.p  pWhat keep me up at night is thisp  pHow would I create a compound key to achieve the local authoritative of a Cassandra node for job entries for its local actor system and thereby its job execution actors, without splitting the job table in multiple column families or the likep  pIn other words how can I create a compound key that makes sure that a jobs are evenly distributed through my cluster and  b a local query on the job table only returns jobs for which this Cassandra node is authoritative and c my distributed agent system still has the possibility to fetch jobs from other nodes, in case it has no own jobs to executep  pA last word on c above.

As a part of this application, I want to demonstrate a functionality which allows mute children to understand voice search. p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pI have RecognizeSpeech class which converts speech to text and SpeakText class which converts text to speech.

The problem is that the RecognizeSpeech class is unable to correctly convert the SpeakText output back to text. p  pI would like to know if there are specific languages in which Speech Recognition and TTS work perfectly back and forth I would also like to know if the recognizer intent should be constructed in some other way which would solve the problem.

Negative 4371 pI have an application that supports both x86 and armv7 platforms.  I should define different codeandroidversionCodecode for different platform apks. Therefore I put for example 100 and 200 in value and upload an apk to Google Play. The issue in devices that support both platforms. If a device on x86 supports arm and the codeandroidversionCodecode of the arm apk greater than the same code for the x86version apk, it downloads the arm apk, not x86. Arm libs work much more slower, at least 5 times in my app. How can i solve that issue I want to install the x86version only on the x86 platform devices, and analogically for the arm ones. Any suggestions p

Negative 4371 pI encountered this weird bug in a c multithread program on linux. The multithreaded part basically executes a loop. One single iteration first loads a sift file containing some features. And then it queries these features against a tree. Since I have a lot of images, I used multiple threads to do this querying. Here is the code snippets.p  precodestruct MultiMatchParam      int threadid     float scores     double scoresd     int perm     sizet dbimagenum     stdvectorltstdstringgt queryfilenames     int startid     int numquery     int dim     VocabTree tree     FILE file    multithread will do normalization anyway void MultiMatchMultiMatchParam ampparam       Clear scores     forsizet t  param.startid t lt param.startid  param.numquery t              for sizet i  0 i lt param.dbimagenum i             param.scores[i]  0.0          DTYPE keys         int numkeys          keys  ReadKeyssfmparam.queryfilenames[t].cstr, param.dim, numkeys          int normalize  true         double mag  param.treegtMultiScoreQueryKeysnumkeys, normalize, keys, param.scores          delete [] keys       codepre  pI run this on a 8core cpu. At first it runs perfectly and the cpu usage is nearly 100 on all 8 cores. After each thread has queried several images about 20 images, all of a sudden the performance cpu usage drops drastically, down to about 30 across all eight cores.p  pI doubt the key to this bug is concerned with this line of code. p  precodedouble mag  param.treegtMultiScoreQueryKeysnumkeys, normalize, keys, param.scores codepre  pSince if I replace it with another costly operations e.g., a large forloop containing sqrt. The cpu usage is always nearly 100. This MultiScoreQueryKeys function does a complex operation on a tree. Since all eight cores may read the same tree no write operation to this tree, I wonder whether the read operation has some kind of blocking effect. But it shouldnt have this effect because I dont have write operations in this function. Also the operations in the loop are basically the same. If it were to block the cpu usage, it would happen in the first few iterations. If you need to see the details of this function or other part of this project, please let me know.p

You could use a Python library, a Java library, or pen and paper.  Its a function, it is deterministic.

You put in some values, it spits out the ciphertext.p  pWhy, then, could there ever be fears that Truecrypt for instance is broken  Theyre not saying AES is broken, theyre saying the program that implements it may be.  AES is, in theory, solid.  So why cant you just run a file through Truecrypt, run it through a reference AES function, and verify that the results are the same  I know it absolutely does not work like that, but I dont know why.p  pWhat makes AES different from SHA1 in this way  Why might Truecrypt AES spit out a different file than SchneierIfier AES, when they were both given all the same inputsp  pIn the end, my question boils down top  pMySHA1X  BobsSHA1X  ...etcp  pBut TrueCryptAESX  HyperCryptAESX  VeraCryptAESX etc.  Why is that  Do all those programs wrap AES, but have different ways of determining stuff like an initialization vector or somethingp  pthis would be the name of my file encryption program if I ever wrote onep

Negative 4371 pFirst of all, Im fairly new to all PDO and MySQL coding. Im working on a website and Im not sure how I should build my database. I looked for an answer but I couldnt find a clear one so Im creating this question. p  pBasicly the website Im working on is a text based game. Therere buttons for players to do some actions. For example clicking to Workout button increases players power based on gold and energy. To do that, my code checks players gold and energy. Then if both checks are passed, it increases players power.p  pMy current database structure is like this Tablesp  precode resources       ID,       Energy,       ...   inventory       ID,       Gold,       ...   attributes       ID,       Power,       ... codepre  pI have to prepare and execute 6 different PDO statements for Workout button. Three times to get information that I need from tables and three times to update tables. For some other buttons, it gets up to 8  9.p  pI heard that using more than 3 or 4 prepared statements in a code really strains the code. But I also heard that creating tables with so many columns strains the database. I really dont know what to do. Can anyone lead me to right directionp

Negative 4371 pThis PowerShell script is very useful, if you have SQL servers in the DMZ you can use this to get the total capacity, used capacity, free space and free space. I use the same script to check the hard drive space for all my internal SQL servers.

Negative 4371 pYoure probably asking yourselves what I mean by conditionally clickablep  pI have an UITableView with some generated cells in it. The cells have some images and labels on them. Wherever I click on the cell area on the cell itself, or on the image or the label, it takes me to a CellDetailViewController  a hrefhttpi.imgur.com5nuqxHe.png relnofollowref. imagea.p  pNow, in the navigation bar I want to have a Filter button, that when clicked or rather emtriggeredem  click to on, click to off, makes the UI elements on those cells perform an elementspecific action when clicked, instead of segueing to the ViewController as they would normally do. I plan on making an action that takes the element and filters the table to show just the cells containing a particular piece of data, according to what the element shown  that means I need to know exactly what element was clicked in what cell best case is it gets passed as a sender in an argument so I can access its properties.p  pWhat I initially though of was I can make the UI elements always call the action, that will check if the Filter button was clicked and then either segue to the ViewController if it was not, or perform the Filter action if it was. The problem with this approach is that it seems really clunky and slowish and I dont really want to reinvent the wheel if there exists a better solution. p  pSo, the question is  is there another way to accomplish this Make UI elements clickable on demandp  pE Added more info about the question.p

Negative 4371 pIs it possible to force a annotation processor to RERUN after all other processors have generated their code Basically what Im running into right now is that Android Databinding is generating a type parameter for one of my classes causing the inherited class from its super not to propagate properly on the first pass of my processor.
