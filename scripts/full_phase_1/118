Positive 118 pUsing Delphi XE3, I created a lookup field obtaining a float value from another client dataset. When presenting the value of this lookup field, if the value has not decimal digits, the value is not presented, otherwise, if the value has decimal digits, the value is presented. I have already checked everything that can interfere such as masks, attributes. There is no reason for that. Is that a problem of Delphi I ask this question because I use the same resource in Delphi XE and no problem occurs.p

Positive 118 pI am using Indy TCPClientTCPServer to verify registration of a mobile device. The process is fairly straight forward where I read an identifier on the Server Side, validate it against the database control file and send back a response to the client.p  pEverything appears to work correctly for the most part but periodically I get the EIDConnClosedGracefully Exception on the Server Side. I cant seem to pinpoint exactly where the connection is being closed improperly. In fact, it appears that the Server is executing a readln when it is not supposed to after the Connection is closed and I do not know why. Possibly I am not synchronizing properly.

Negative 118 pI have a question or best approach of connecting interface either during runtime or compilelink time.

Negative 118 pIm working on a fairly simple iPhone app to solve the quadratic equation, mostly because its so easyat least the concepts and mathp  pIve created an interface in Interface Builder that has a couple Labels, 3 text fields varAfield, etc and a Solve button. The 3 text fields which are set as UITextFieldDelegate have been set so that they automatically show the Numbers and Punctuation keyboard. This code is used to dismiss the keyboard, then automatically move to the next variable when the user taps the return key which says Next except for variable C which says Donep  precode BOOLtextFieldShouldReturnUITextField theTextField  if theTextField  varAfield      [varAfield resignFirstResponder] [varBfield becomeFirstResponder]  if theTextField  varBfield  [varBfield resignFirstResponder] [varCfield becomeFirstResponder]  if theTextField  varCfield  [varCfield  resignFirstResponder]  return YES  codepre  pAnyway, the problem occurs with the first instance of becomeFirstResponder.  The keyboard comes up as it should, however, its using an ASCII keyboard instead of Numbers and Punctuation The second time its called, it works as it should.  Also, if I start from variable A again it will work fine.  No matter where I move the first instance of becomeFirstResponder, the first and only first time its called within the app, it doesnt behave correctly.p  pUpdate becomeFirstResponder still even on the first instance respects my choice of return key, but no matter which keyboard is set, it still shows the ASCII Capable one.  So whats going on Ive checked everything in IB and it appears to be ok...p

Negative 118 pMy project requires polling a certain URL for a JSON response, using AJAX. The first AJAX request that I make alerts the server that I want some JSON content, and it begins building and cacheing a response, sending me back em status  pending em for each subsequent AJAX request until the JSON is ready. At that point, the response changes to JSON that contains content that I can parse and display in the document, which I want to do as soon as the URL returns anything other than em status  pending em.p  pIve set up a polling function that works as expected to repeatedly request JSON from the URL. However, the problem is that it continues to get the response em status  pending em even when I navigation directly to the URL and can see that the full JSON response is ready and is being served. For some reason, my polling function still gets em status  pending em.p  pWhen I refresh the page that contains the polling code, it generally works on the first request  i.e. it gets the full JSON response. That leads me to believe that its some sort of caching issue, but Im not sure where or why. Shouldnt each AJAX request get a fresh response, or is this something I can set up in my em.ajaxem callp  pHeres the code Im using nowp  precodefunction ajaxpoll    .ajax     url JSONURL,  JSONURL is a string containing the URL to poll     dataType json,     error functionxhrdata        displayerror     ,     success functionxhrdata        if xhrdata.status  pending          poll  increment poll counter  poll is a global variable to track the number of requests made         if poll lt POLLS   POLLS is a global variable to set the maximum number of requests           setTimeoutfunction  ajaxpoll , INTERVAL  wait INTERVAL before another AJAX request          else            displayerror                 else          successxhrdata            ,     contentType applicationjson     codepre  pemsuccessem is the function that displays the JSON content i.e. what Im waiting for to become available while polling on the page.p  pOne thing worth noting is that while testing the code locally, polling a local .json test file, I can change the files contents from em status  pending em to a response containing content like Im looking for, save the file between polling instances, and on the next poll, my code sees the new content and works as expected. It just isnt working in the staging environment.p

Negative 118 pI have a an method that retrieves Groups that are present in certain areas.

Negative 118 pI am distributing with VS 2008 .NET and obfuscation.p  pI am up against the frustrating problem of not being able to see line numbers in stack traces.p  pWhilst there are workarounds eg. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1328836includelinenumbersinstacktracewithoutpdbhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1328836includelinenumbersinstacktracewithoutpdbap  pwhen the stack traces are returned holding PDB files locally etc this is not what I am looking for.p  pI am looking for a way to get the line number embedded some way at compile time.p  pIn my view this is a major oversight on the part of MS. There is no logical reason why we should not be able to opt to include a macro for the line number at compile time. In my view this is a major oversight of MS which is leading to major headaches for developers all over the place.p  pI have no experience whatsoever of writing addins or mods for Visual Studio and am calling on the community for any ideas, specifically, any way to get the line number included at compile time so that we can deliberately output it to logging with our stack traces in exception reports.p  pIts such a simple feature that the builder could easily do. We used to have something like doubleunderscoreLINEdoubleunderscore in C.p  pSurely we can find a way to mod VS.NET in order to get this information at compile time for .NET apps.p
Negative 118 pIm making a full screen app that uses double buffering. The problem is a following when I debug it and the debugger pauses the process breakpoint hit or exception thrown, the secondary buffer may got stuck on the screen. In this case I only see the current frame and the mouse pointer and I can interact with the IDEs UI but I dont see it because it is drawn on the primary buffer witch is not visible and I only guess where are the buttons. I think this behavior is graphics driver and OS dependent but probably Im not the only one who has this problem no similar problems on Ubuntu but in Windows.p  pDoes anyone have ideas how to bring the primary buffer to frontp  pps feel free to correct my typos and give better title if you have better idea.p  pEDIT ok, I know I can buy a new monitor or run the app in windowed mode. But my question is about the full screen mode. And I forgot to mention if Im unable to restart my program and the 2nd buffer got stuck the only way to escape from this situation is hitting reset.p

I mean I would like the user control to not determine the width during the layout of the column, but to adjust its width to whatever is the width of the column.p  pIn the example, initially the Grid would set the column width to the value of the button, and the user control would use the column width to resize itself. Then if a long text is entered in the Textbox, as soon as the Textbox starts to be wider than the button, and the column starts to be resized as well, in turn the user control would adjust to maintain the same size than the column.p  pIve tried combinations of stretch values, and also have used MeasureOverride in the user control. The latter doesnt work because the AvalaibleSize received is Infinity, not the column width.p

Negative 118 pI have and EntryEditor that allows users to add postits views with a UItextView in them onto it and move them around.p  pIm working on handling touch events making it so only one postit is selected at a time, and unselecting the postit if the user touchs outside any postit.  Ive implemented the touch handling in the postits, and Im using notification to tell the EntryEditorController that a postit has been selected, and it resets the selection property on the postits as needed and calls setNeedsDisplay.  This all works fine I can move postits around and only one is selected at a time.p  pHandling touchs outside of any postits is my design issue.  Im considering either overriding all the touch events in the postit superview the EntryEditor, OR I could make the EntryEditor a buttonControl and adding an action for touchUpInside.  Any input on which approach makes more sense  I tried using UITapGestureRecognizers, but had troubles with getting that to do what I want.p  pThanks for any input.p

Negative 118 pemFirst of all sorry for my English. I am not native speakeremp  pI have a problem with selecting data.p  pMy problem is that I dont know how to optimize SELECT from table component. As I understand  I cannot create any indexes which help Postgres make select based on set of rules from other table.p  pI have following schema Component can have several parameters and one owner. Parameters and owners can be added to any  groups. There is several conveyors where this components should appear. There is special filtration rules, which based on components groups and owners. This rule can allow component or block it. Rules may be any number and some additional logic can be applied for them.p  pTable component can contains large amount of data. Each conveyor should process components by portions  or by pages.p  pFor know I am doing so 1.Take conveyor id and select all its rules into the temporary table. 2.Go through all components and call my function for each which takes componentid and ownerid and use temporary table from step 1 for checking rules.p  plook like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM component WHERE checkrulescomponentid, ownerid LIMIT plimit OFFSET poffset codepre  pBut in this case Postgres every time should go through all records in table which makes performance hit.  This structure should work in high load environment with large amount of data. So I need way to optimize this situation or have ability to scale it. Probably using Postgres in this case is not good solution and I need use some other system like MapReduce or BigTable, but for know I am not work with them. p  pRecommend something please.

Negative 118 pIm a pretty comfortable CoreData user. I had a problem that was absolutely killing me, figured out what was going wrong and have NO CLUE why it was causing the problems I was seeing. Can anyone explain thisp  pOkay, we have a main MOC that does most the readonly data work and handles simple write operations. When were about to do a big writeimportetc, we allocate a background MOC on a new thread, do all the heavy work, then save it. Saving causes our NSManagedObjectContextWillSaveNotification to fire and then we mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification and everything on the main MOC reflects the changes. Pretty standard.p  pSo a few days ago a change was made in one of the NSManagedObject subclasses. The change was a call in setValueforKey. When no special handling was done in that method, we were originally calling [super setValue forKey]. It was changed to [self setPrimitateValue forKey] and...p  pAfter a save the mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification would get called, but the main MOC wouldnt reflect the changes. So thats a bit weird. But close the application and then opening it again, the changes would magically BE THERE. Whatp  pI know its some problem with the persistant store saving the changes but not the other MOC. Then when the new MOC gets created new launch, everything is in sink again. Whyp  pAny light on this topic would help a bunch.p

Negative 118 pI have a strange problem with absolute positioning and sizing elements to fit around a div. I have some div thats set in position and size on an existing page its given to me. I want to adorn it from the left and bottom with two divs, so that theyd hug it and create an L shape. I need to do this dynamically, as the div size and position change in the course of the normal usage of the web page.p  pTo achieve my goal I first get the divs offset using jquerys .offset and dimensions using .outerWidthHeight. I then calculate the divs limits top, bottom, left and use the to size and absolutely position my two divs, which are 0.5 opaque and with a high zindex see sample code. I set the divs size using jquerys .width and .height, and position using .css with the top and left properties. I tried using .offset to set positioning but did not seem to work well I ran into overlaps andor unwanted spaces in all browsers.p  pThis setting works great for FF tested on 3.6 no matter what the viewzoom setting is. However, on IE8 IE8 standards mode, and chrome tested on version 6, this will work perfectly strongonlystrong as long as viewzoom is set to 100. If set to higher say 125 in IE a 0.5px spacing will occur between the top and bottom divs c and a in my demo code for emcertainem values of the adorned divs red div b on my sample code height. when zoom is set to less than 100 say 75 in IE, overlaps of the two divs will occur for some values of the adorned divs height.p  pI created a sample page demonstrating the problem in jsbin.com  a hrefhttpjsbin.comoduxo4 relnofollowdemoa. When running this sample on IE with viewzoom set to 125 the default size of the red div should demonstrate the problem. try using the up and down buttons to change the divs height and see how things behave. you can also type a number in the textbox and then click the go button to jump to a specific height. p  pI really hope someone finds a solution for this, as Ive been banging my head against this one for quite some time, trying all kinds of different stuff here.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Following Streloks answer below, I forgot to state that I must have the hugging DIVs to be absolutely positioned in the BODY tag, so that I can be sure that theyd always overlay the rest of the page. I cant rely on them to be in the same container as the red DIV, nor change their basic positioning properties positionaboslute, as children of BODY, and the zindex.p  pstrongUpdatestrong hradac below gave an answer that solves this problem for the default zoom modes of IE. This is enough for me to constitute an answer, but if anyone else has some other idea that could solve the problem in a general way, Id love to hear it.p  pI created the sample code as a very simple demonstration of the problem I ran into.

Negative 118 pI am running an AdWords campaign and I am having trouble with the conversion tracking code. Basically, I believe I know what the problem is but just do not know how to fix it. When a user signs up for the website, they have to fill out the registration form. After they fill out the registration form, it will take them to PayPal where they have to make their payment. Once they make their payment on PayPal, the user is returned back to the website and greeted with a Thank You for Registering Message. On this page, the Thank You for Registering Message page, I have the Google AdWords conversion tracking code installed at the bottom of the page before the closing  tag. For some reason though, in my AdWords account, the conversion data does not show up. p  pThe reason I believe this is happening is because the user is leaving the website to checkout at PayPal and is then returned to our website. We know that the users are coming from our online AdWords campaigns but we would like to see this data in our repots. Is there a setting or something that needs to be addedchanged to the conversion tracking code to get this to workp  pThanks in advance.p

The problem is that when the user presses Enter when in an input field, rather than using the mouse to click on the submit button, the image input is activated which in this case corresponds to a cancel event, exactly the opposite of the proceed action that is natural given the UI in question.p  pWhat I want to do is to, on an Enter keypress, activate the codeltinput typesubmitgtcode button eminstead ofem the codeltinput typeimagegtcode, without breaking submission by clicking the image. How can I do that Preferably in a crossbrowser manner so I dont need yet more special cases in the code.p  pNo jQuery solutions, please, since this application doesnt use it and introducing a whole new library for such a simple thing is going to be a very hard sell  stock JavaScript is perfectly fine, though. Obviously the best would be if it can be done in just HTML and CSS, but I have my doubts about the feasibility of that.p  pIn essence, this question seems to me to be sort of the exact opposite of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions477691htmlsubmittingaformbypressingenterwithoutasubmitbuttonHTML Submitting a form by pressing enter without a submit buttona.p  pUnfortunately, since the different parts of the UI are rendered by different classes and kept in separate .aspx files specifically, the codeltinput typeimagegtcode is in one place, and the codeltinput typesubmitgtcode in quite another, reordering the elements in the generated HTML is not really a feasible solution either.p

Once I had them in a datatable I figured I could remove the unnecessary rowscolumns and then sort and compare the pertinent info for differences.  The difficulty is that the various files are formatted differently so I will need to get each type formatted correctly.  Is this the best approach  p  pIf so, I need help with the datatables.  I have read in a .csv, parsed it into a datatable, but Im having trouble with the logiccoding to get rid of the rows and columns that I dont need.  Also, Im not sure how to handle a row that has a cell with a comma seperated list of values that will need to be split into individual rows.p  pThank you.p

Negative 118 pI had implemented a few methods that were being handled by individual background threads. I understand the complexity of doing things this way but when I tested the results it all seemed fine. Each thread accesses the same variables at times and there is maximum of 5 threads working at any given time and I guess I should have used synchlock but my question is whether there can be any way the threads could have been executing the processes without overwriting the variable contents. I was under the impression that each thread was allocated a site in memory for that variable and even though it is named the same, in memory it is a different location mapped with a specific thread, right so if there were collisions you should be getting an error that it cannot access that variable if it were used by another thread.p  pAm I wrong on thisp

Negative 118 pHey guys, I currently have a root table view which has a toolbar at the bottom and has labels and a refresh button within it, much like the Mail apps toolbar. This root table view controller obtains data from a server by allocating and initializing a DataUpdater class. Within this class are the NSURLConnection delegate methods that are called while communicating with the server.p  pAs you can probably guess, I need to know when certain delegate functions are called within the DataUpdater class and the values of the parameters passed to these delegate functions so that I can update the labels on the toolbar accordingly i.e. Connecting..., Updated, etc.p  pThe problem I am having is determining how to notify the root table view controller of what is going on in these delegate methods. Would I use protocols, if so how I have been skimming the documentation and dont quite see how I would get this effect. Or would you suggest I implement my program another wayp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 118 pI have a text field that uses jQuery UI Datapicker. It also has an inline label from the inlineformfield jQuery plugin.p  pWhen the plugin is active, it assigns a class to the textbox, called .intrafieldlabel. The datepicker also assigns a class called .hasDatepicker. The first class is supposed to be light grey, and switch to black when text is put into the field. However, the datepicker complicates things. The fields text stays light grey when I enter a date with the datepicker.p  pHow can I get around this, so that the date picked from the datepicker widget is black as wellp  pI need to be able to remove the class code.intrafieldlabelcode from the text input as soon as a date is picked.

Ive tried defining class variables as void em, void em, id, UIViewController  and UIViewController .  For some reason I cant seem to make it work.p  pI should note that a number of approaches do work, however, they run into trouble when the view is dismissed and the autorelease process takes place.

Negative 118 pHi all I am using the fftw C libraries to compute the frequency spectrum for some signal processing applications on embedded systems.

Negative 118 pOkay, so I have a question for all you professionals out there.  I have been doing Ruby and Rails for about 3 years, and I am really starting to get the advanced architecture concepts and have been digging into a few gems to learn as much as I can without getting over my head.  In particular, the Mechanize gem has really captured my attention. I have a degree in Statistics, and I like the MechanizeChain mechanism for what I assume represents a chain of events. There may be great potential here for learning something that would help me with modeling Markov Chain Monte Carlo Stochastic processes.p  pMy question is this Can anyone recommend a gem or framework or code that is a well documented  and by this I mean explanations of how the thing works will help bring me up to speed quicker with advanced concepts   not just source code docs. b complex, but not too complex, so that it takes for ever to grok c will allow me to learn more about gem architecures and how they fit into the rails ecosystem.p  pThanks again Love you people... Really do.p

Negative 118 pI have a Flash component that is nested in multiple divs div1div2flashHolderflashContent. I also have a jQuery modal dialog popup box that warns of upcoming session timeout. Previously, Firefox showed this popup over top of the Flash correct while all other browsers hid the popup behind the Flash. To fix this, I added codewmodetransparentcode to the codeltobjectgtcode tags as well as the codeswfobject.embedcode method. This fixed the problem in IE, Chrome and Safari.

Negative 118 pYou see this in iPhone apps like Gilt. The user scrolls a view, and a subview apparently sticks to one edges as the rest of the scrollView slides underneath. That is, there is a text box or whatever in the scrollView, that as the scrollView hits the top of the view, then sticks there as the rest of the view continues to slide.p  pSo, there are several issues. First, one can determine via scrollViewDidScroll during normal scrolling when the view of interest is passing or reappearing. There is a fair amount of granularity here  the differences between delegate calls can be a hundred of points or more. That said, when you see the view approach the top of the scrollView, you turn on a second copy of the view statically displayed under the scrollView top. I have not coded this, but it seems like it will lack a real stick look  the view will first disappear then reappear.p  pSecond, if one does a setContentOffsetanimated, one does not get the delegate messages Gilt does not do this. So, how do you get the callbacks in this case Do you use KVO on scroll.layer.presentationLayer.bounds p

Negative 118 pI am developing an application that is writing data to a file. Lets assume while it is writing the data we plug off the battery. What will happen to the file will it be halfwriten corrupted, empty or same as before we wrote to it My guess is that it will be corrupted. How to check if it is corrupted when we restart the phone when the file was storing an arraylist of objects will java throw a corrupted file exception or say that the read arraylist is null or that it is an unknown objectp  pPS. maybe create another file that will keep the MD5 checksum of the data file And whenever I write to the file data first I produce its checksum and then when I read from the data file produce a checksum and compare it with the previous. That will indicate whether my data are intact but it wont allow me to roll back to a previous state precorrupted one. I would like a method that would be as lightweight as possible, I am already using the CPU too much by readingwriting changes to my storage on every attribute change of a set of thousands. Probably a database would have been a better idea.p

Basically when they create the ToDoDataContext class they have a constructor and a static property for the connection string which makes sense, but then they place another property called ToDoItems of type Table. Now logically it makes sense because this is a table for the ToDoItems but what doesnt make sense is how we never actually assign it to the database. When I ran the program it just created the table.

Negative 118 pIm trying to place a hidden validation popup on the DOM, and then animate it in when the form is sent. I have found that the jQuery animation methods operate differently when using either code.hidecode or code.cssopacity, 0code prior to animating the element into full opacity.p  pEarly in the code, if I use code.hidecode, code.animatecode with its opacity property set to 1, will not work at all. However, the .fadeIn method works just using code.hidecode first. If I set the elements codeopacitycode to 0 with the code.csscode method, then code.animationcode will fade in the element. I would like to use code.animatecode because of the flexibility and added options.p  pI had decided to just go ahead and use the code.csscode approach, but then ran into a problem with trying to support IE8. code.cssopacity, 0code will not hide the element in IE8, so my only option at this point is to use code.fadeIncode for what Im trying to accomplish.p  pHas anyone else ran into this issue, and if so, could I bum some advice from you p

This is very uncommon I know, but we add this using this Apache httpd configurationp  precodeRequestHeader append Authorization Basic early codepre  pThe a hrefhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.0modmodheaders.html relnofollowApache modheader documentationa saysp  blockquote   pThe response header is appended to any existing header of the same   name. When a new value is merged onto an existing header it is   separated from the existing header with a comma. This is the HTTP   standard way of giving a header multiple values.p blockquote  pBut I dont think it is correct for this Authorization header. The RFC definition does not allow this. But some headers permit commaseparated list. I am not sure if this is a general rule for all HTTP headers.p  pI am stronglooking for a paragraph in the HTTP 1.1 RFCstrong that prooves my idea this is not correct. I have already found something that is saying this is valid only for headers that can be separated, but this is not a proof.p  blockquote   pMultiple messageheader fields with the same fieldname MAY be present   in a message if and only if the entire fieldvalue for that header   field is defined as a commaseparated list [i.e., values]. It MUST   be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one   fieldname fieldvalue pair, without changing the semantics of the   message, by appending each subsequent fieldvalue to the first, each   separated by a comma. The order in which header fields with the same   fieldname are received is therefore significant to the interpretation   of the combined field value, and thus a proxy MUST NOT change the   order of these field values when a message is forwarded.p blockquote  pIt really does not make sense, but I am looking for a clear proof.p

I had hoped to install a script on rackspace file cloud to do an API check back to my website before serving, but apparently rackspace file cloud doesnt allow this.p  pImagine a site where you purchase mp3s.

Negative 118 pI just spent a few days greatly improving our software getting rid of lots of unnecessary object allocations. The improvements are dramatic, I can now run a process with almost no new objects being allocated. Megabytes upon megabytes of of objects just thrown away were created before my fixes.p  pNow, I want to visualize the improvements in some impressive way its all about measurable impact . Any tips I used VisualVM for lots of the instrumentation, but it doesnt really show much. The monitor shows something called GC activity but its not that useful. Ideally Id like to be able to keep a cumulative count of the size of all object created in the process before and after the fix. Any tools allowing me to do thatp  pThanksp
Negative 118 pNot the most clearly crafted title I am afraid.p  pMy website has a search page which intially loads the first 6 results of any query, then loads 6 more until the screen is full, or as the users scrolls down.p  pAt the top of the page and I trying to add some filters to among other things, fade out any out of stock item results.p  pSo, the code behind adds the class outOfStock to any item container for products which are out of stock.

Negative 118 pI have my code running on a Linux server.  I edit my code from my laptop which happens to be a Mac.  I use netatalk so that I can easily mount the code directory on my server from my laptop.  I recently started playing with Pyramid and SQLalchemy and I wanted to add unittest to my development practices.p  pOS X  Netatalk create a .AppleDouble subdirectory when I view any directory from the laptop.  Normally, this isnt a problem, I just ignore the .AppleDouble subdirectories.p  pThe moment I visit the directory Im running my tests from, OS X  netatalk add the .AppleDouble directory and in this directory, I can find files that have the exact same names as are present in the parent directory.  This is a problem because unittest recurses through all of the directories it find looking for a pattern of test.py and tries to import those files.  Which fails on any file in the .AppleDouble directory which contain icon data, desktop placement, and such.p  pI know that one option is not to use netatalk.  Id like to avoid that if possible.p  pLooking at the code in unittest specifically loader.py, it seems that the discovery of test cases happens in a function called discover and a related function findfiles.p  pI am looking for some thoughts on how to best override the discover and findfiles functions.  I dont have a lot of experience overriding the Python library and I dont see any obvious hooks.p  pIf it matters, I am using virtualenv and am pretty sure that if I put a copy of unittest in the virtualenv, it will override the system version.  That probably a good start, but Im interested in knowing what other people think of as a better solution rather than just a good one.p

Negative 118 pI have a Visual Studio 2010, XNA 4.0 game solution. Call it Game. It has a project named Game with an associated content project named GameContent. I also have created a second project in the solution named LevelEditor with an associated content project named LevelEditorContent.p  pGame and LevelEditor can both load content from their own content projects, no problem. I decided to see if I could get LevelEditor to load content from GameContent, though, so I added a content reference in LevelEditor to GameContent.p  pNow, when I click Debug or hit F5, Game crashes with a FileNotFound error on one of its pieces of content. If I remove the content reference from LevelEditor, Game works again. I have no idea why. Game is the only startup project.p  pTo make it even stranger, if I rightclick on the Game project in Solution Explorer, select Debug, then Start New Instance, Game runs fine  no FileNotFound error at all  regardless of whether LevelEditor has that content reference or not.p  pWhy would a content reference in a DIFFERENT project screw up Games ability to load its content And whats different between F5Debug and Start New Instance that would make the error occur using the former but not the latterp
Negative 118 pI have several script running on a server which pickle and unpickle various dictionaries.  They all use the same basic code for pickling as shown belowp  precodeSellerDictopenhomehostadlSellerDictkm,rb SellerDictionarykmpickle.loadSellerDict SellerDict.close  SellerDictopenhomehostadlSellerDictkm,wb pickle.dumpSellerDictionarykm,SellerDict SellerDict.close codepre  pAll the scripts run fine except for one of them.  The one that has issues goes to various websites and scrapes data and stores it in dictionary.  This code runs all day long pickling and unpickling dictionaries and stops at midnight.  A cronjob then starts it again  the next morning.  This script can run for weeks without having a problem but about once a month the script dies due to a EOFError when it tries to open a dictionary.  The size of the dictionaries are usually about 80 MB.  I even tried adding SellerDict.flush before SellerDict.close when pickling the data to make sure evening was being flushed. p  pAny ideas what could be causing this  Python is pretty solid so I dont think it is due to the size of the file.  Where the code runs fine for a long time before dying it leads me to believe that maybe something is being saved in the dictionary that is causing this issue but I have no idea.p  pAlso, if you know of a better way to be saving dictionaries other than pickle I am open to options.  Like I said earlier, the dictionaries are constantly being opened and closed.  Just for clarification, only one program will use the same dictionary so the issue is not being caused by several programs trying to access the same dictionary.p  pUPDATEp  pHere is the traceback that I have from a log file.p  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File homehostadlCompileRecentPosts.py, line 782, in ltmodulegt     main   File homehostadlCompileRecentPosts.py, line 585, in main     SellerDictionarykmpickle.loadSellerDict EOFError codepre

In code, there is a void function which can be filled with the code I am looking for. Just to give you an impression of how the code looks like. Right now it is empty. p  pIve done some research and I came up with codebringSubViewToFrontcode and codesendSubViewToBackcode, HeadsUpUI sample app. The idea I had was that I could show the search bar by bringing it to front, put OVER the table view layer, while setting the tableview 44 pixels lower with content offset or so. p  pLikewise, sending the search bar layer to back, BEHIND the table view to hide it. So in the void function I tried something with code[parentview sendSubViewToBackchild view]code but to no effect. So my question is how do I hide or show my search bar while having a table view and a navigation bar and a bar below with the button to do sop  pKind Regards,p  pJohnp

Negative 118 pWhen I change my code methods, properties, class I usually write manually the date and the assemblyfile version in the XML Tags for documentation comments in order to remember when I edited last time and in which version that piece of code.p  pIn my own projects I use the tag version, in other projects I put edit date and assembly version in the tag remarks. I do this for all functions, classes, methods of my solution of course when I have more functions in the same file and I edit the Function1, I have to notice the dateversion when I edited that function and if I edit the Function2, the tag of the Function1 has not to be updated.p  pI was wondering if there is a VS 2010 addin that could automate partially too this process.p

Negative 118 pI have two Scenes in my Storyboard that are nearly identical.  Both are UITableViewControllers.  Both have header and footer views.  The header views have a UISearchBar and the footer views have a UIView that contains a UITextField.  Each have only one prototype cell.  One is prototyped as a Basic cell and the other is prototyped as Right Detail cell.p  pHeres the problem.  When I click the UITextField in the footer view on the first scene, the table resizes automatically so that the bottom of the table is at the top of the keyboard. This allows me to scroll the table up so the footer view shows and the user is able to see what theyre typing.  The other scene will not automatically resize the UITableView so the UITableView cannot scroll the footer view to where it can be seen and the UITextField is hidden under the keyboard.  I cant even manually scroll the table far enough since the footer is always at the bottom of the UITableView.p  pA little added info.  The scene that works has many rows of data while the one that doesnt work only has a couple.  I tried adding a number of rows until the table had enough to enable scrolling and it doesnt fix the problem.p  pI have checked everything I can think of and I cant see anything that would allow one of the views to let the UITableView to automatically resize to work with the keyboard and the other not.  I must have overlooked something but I cant seem to find it.p  pAny help will be greatly appreciatedp  pRobp
Negative 118 pSpecifically, inspired by Js conjucation operator gamp.f  f inversegf I need a way to augment functions with additional information. The obvious way is to use ADT. Something likep  precodedata Isomorphism a b  ISO FW a gt b , BW b gt a FW f isoApp x  f x BW g isoApp x  g x codepre  pBut the need for an application function really hurts code readability when most of the time you just want the forward function. What would be very useful is a classp  precodeclass Applyable a b c  a b gt c where     apply  a gt b gt c codepre  pI think the b could be made implicit with existential quantifiers but Im not comfortable enough to be sure I wouldnt get the signature wrongp  pNow the apply would be made implicit so you could just writep  precodef x codepre  pas you would any other function. Exp  precodeinstance Applyable a gt b a b where     apply f x  f x instance Applyable Isomorphism a b a b where     apply f x  FW f x  inverse Iso f g  Iso g f codepre  pthen you could write something likep  precodeconjugate  Applyable g b b gt g gt Iso a b gt b gt a f conjugate g  inverse f . g . f codepre  pIdeally the type signature could be inferredp  pHowever, these semantics seem complicated, as you would also need to modify . to support Applyable rather than functions. Is there any way to simply trick the type system into treating Applyable datatypes as functions for all normal purposes Is there a fundamental reason that this is impossible  a bad ideap

Negative 118 pIve developed an application and one of its aims is to upload a file to the server. On average the file is quite large and upload takes a lot of time, so to make sure itll be processed till the end, I moved the critical part of IO to the IntentService. From the IntentService for every single upload theres an AsyncTask started which does the IO job. Unfortunately the screen scrolling gets freezed several times while doing the upload in the background. I thought that a combination of IntentServiceAsyncTask should be enough... Id be grateful for any suggestions how to solve it..p

Negative 118 pI am getting an occasional problem where, after adding a new control to an aspx page, the control definition is not created in the designer file  meaning its undefined in codebehind.  Either if you type a new control into source or drag and drop from the toolbox, the designer is not updated.  There are no errors or warnings on the page.p  pSo far Ive only seen it on aspx pages using nested master pages.  At the same time as this error is occurring on the aspx page, designer updates DO work on user controls p  pThe usual tricks of switching from source view to design view, saving, reloading the project, restarting visual studio do not work.  I have write permissions to the designer file.p  pI thought it could be the combination of Extensions I have installed  but disabling all extensions does not help either.

Negative 118 pI am using everyauth in my expressjs app to do oauth authentication amp authorization with 37signals site. However, this is a general oauth question.p  pWhen the user accesses my app the first time, he authenticates and authorizes my app from 37signals site. He is then redirected to my app, where I save the user info in Database along with the access token. Now lets say, the user logs out. If he tries to login, he is forced to authorize my app again. This is not right. I expected everyauth to bypass the authorization step, since it was already done once.

Negative 118 pI just saw a video demo of controldragging from the view controller icon for an ipad storyboard at the bottom of a view controller to the toolbar within that view controller. While the view controller icon and the toolbar are not on the screen at the same time, the dragging actually scrolls the storyboard enabling the connection between the two.p  pHowever, in my ipad storyboard I am unable to make that autoscrolling happen and thus unable to complete the controldrag.p  pIs there a way to make the storyboard scrolling happen while control dragging I thought of temporarily moving the toolbar to the bottom of the screen to make the connection and then moving it back. But the storyboard wont autoscroll to let me do that either. Im using a 13 macbook pro. There appears to be no zoom setting that will have both on the screen at the same time.p  pAlternately, can someone tell me if there is an alternate way to accomplish that Which part of the code would I controldrag top  pThanks.p

Negative 118 pI have a web app where I make a bunch of ajax calls when the page is loaded. I was expecting the browser would drop the loading indicator as soon as the page was loaded and the JS, CSS files were downloaded. But it keeps on showing the loading indicator till all ajax calls have returned.p  pBut if I wait for sometime before making the ajax calls the browser does drop the loading indicator. The amount of time I have to wait is not fixed. On localhost 200ms is enough but on server with browser cache cleared, around 2secs is required. Is it the time required for all js and css files to be downloaded p  pDoes anyone know the logic behind this. When should I make the ajax calls on page load so that browsers loading indicator does not wait till all ajax calls have returned p

Negative 118 pThis app was working with no problems but was too slow. It was running everything on the one UI thread,  when a page loaded with many images in gridView it would take a long delay before the page would load.  I fixed this problem using code from the android docs called a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingdisplayingbitmapsprocessbitmap.html relnofollowProcessing Bitmaps Off the UI Threada p  pUsing the code it now loads the gridview page vary fast and after you can see it loading each small bitmap image one by one in a separate background thread.p  pIn this code that uses AsyncTask for the multithreading part it also uses a couple of methods to reduce the image size to eliminate out of memory errors. The same image reduction methods i used in the previous single threaded version of this program.  No matter how big the image it should not be bigger than 200dp by 200dp set by the image reduction method.  It works in the older version of the app without multithreading,  and it looks ok for the most part in the new version of the app.  but there is a strange problem.p  pI am now getting out of memory errors connected to the BitmapFactory decode method. p  pHow this happens is I started testing the app with many smaller images and put one huge one in there about 10,000 X 10,000 pixel bitmap. That should not be causing problems because the images are being reduced by using bitmap factory options.p  pThe errors dont happen right away. The app works fine for a while but after moving around and going back an forth between activities. After 3 to 5 minutes it will crash.p  pIs anyone else having problems like this  And can you offer any ideas that might be the cause I could check out  Or help me to start looking in the right directionp  pThe image reducing code is shown here below and under that is the logcat output.p  precode    class BitmapWorkerTask extends AsyncTaskltString, Void, Bitmapgt      private final WeakReferenceltImageViewgt imageViewReference     private String data        public BitmapWorkerTaskImageView imageView           Use a WeakReference to ensure the ImageView can be garbage collected         imageViewReference  new WeakReferenceltImageViewgtimageView            Decode image in background.

Negative 118 pRecently, I have been going though a hrefhttpceleryproject.org relnofollowcelerya amp a hrefhttpkombu.readthedocs.org relnofollowkombua documentation as i need them integrated in one of my projects. I have a basic understanding of how this should work but documentation examples using different brokers have me confused.p  pHere is the scenariop  pWithin my application i have two views codeViewAcode and codeViewBcode both of them does some expensive processing, so i wanted to have them use celery tasks for processing. So this is what i did.p  h3views.pyh3  precodedef ViewArequest     tasks.dotaska.applyasyncargs[a, b]   def ViewBrequest     tasks.dotaskb.applyasyncargs[a, b] codepre  h3tasks.pyh3  precodetask def dotaskaa, b      Do something Expensive  task def dotaskba, b      Do something Expensive here too codepre  pUntil now, everything is working fine. The problem is that codedotaskacode creates a codetxtcode file on the system, which i need to use in codedotaskbcode. Now, in the codedotaskbcode method i can check for the file existence and call the tasks coderetrycode method [which is what i am doing right now] if the file does not exist.p  pHere, I would rather want to take a different approach i.e. where messaging comes in. I would want codedotaskacode to send a message to codedotaskbcode once the file has been created instead of looping the retry method until the file is created.p  pI read through the documentation of codecelerycode and codekombucode and updated my settings as follows.p  precodeBROKERURL  django CELERYRESULTBACKEND  database CELERYRESULTDBURI  sqlitecelery TASKRETRYDELAY  30 Define Time in Seconds DATABASEROUTERS  [portal.dbrouters.CeleryRouter] CELERYQUEUES        Queuefilecreation, exchangeexchanges.genex, routingkeyfile.create,  CELERYROUTES  celeryconf.routers.CeleryTaskRouter, codepre  pand i am stuck here. dont know where to go from here. p  pWhat should i do next to make codedotaskacode to broadcast a message to codedotaskbcode on file creation  and what should i do to make codedotaskbcode receive consume the message and process the code further p  pAny Ideas and suggestions are welcome.p

Negative 118 pIve been trying to understand the docs for NSWindow,NSView,NSBox,NSCollection in order to make the best choice for my project, but I think Im missing some things.p  pI need to display 6 items, in a group each item consists of a fixed namelabel, slider, and variable label. They control plots in an adjacent NSView.p  pI could simply plunk them down individually in a window or a custom view no more work except for hooking them up. So far I see no real advantage to either one and either will display the groups and function correctly.p  pWith what seems to me to be a substantial amount of extra work, especially dealing with poor documentation, I could make an NSCollection or an NSBox. An NSCollection would enforce fixed locations and possibly facilitate additions or deletions, which I dont expect to do. With the NSBox, locations are flexible and I see that I can drag the box and move the whole group if I ever have to. Otherwise, I fail to see any advantages. Can anyone sell me some things I can do with them that might be usefulp  pBut I keep wondering if the Window and View are so easy, why does anyone bother with collections and boxes Just because theyre pretty, in some sensep

Negative 118 pSo I am trying to make a contact form in an Alert Dialogue box which opens from a menu option. I have 3 EditText fields in my form and in my Main.java I read from those fields when the Send button in form is pressed and then I start an Email intent, or at least thats what it is supposed to do. Right now the app crashes as soon as I press the send button. Now I have troubleshooted the problem and it doesnt seem to be in the intent but it occurs when I read from the EditText fields. The code works fine when I take out the EditText reading part and just put filler information in its place, but I need this to work with the EditTexts. Thank you.

Negative 118 pThe short version of all this is that Im using TempData to store feedback messages and after switching to using CookieTempDataProvider they dont show up when using the a PRG pattern, but if I revert back to SessionTempDataProvider they do.p  pIn my MVC4 application I have a pattern of writing an alert message to the temp data for displaying on the screen after a successful CreateUpdate or when something goes wrong on certain pages and I need to show a failure message. For example...p  precode[HttpPost, ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public ActionResult EditPeopleEditFormModel model      if ModelState.IsValid         return RedirectToActionEdit, new  id  model.ObjectId      try              var person  personService.UpdatePersonmodel  personService is set via DI in constructor         TempData[message]  Person successfully updated.         TempData[messageType]  success         return RedirectToActionDetails, new  id  person.ObjectId           catch DomainException ex              For putting business logic errors in the ModelState         ModelState.AddModelErrorstring.Empty, ex.Message         return RedirectToActionEdit, new id  model.ObjectId       codepre  pI have a partial view called by my Layout.cshtml file that is basically a placeholder DIV element plus some js that gets filled with my feedback message, and this works fine.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7Od9X.png altUpdateFeedbackp  pNow this works by default but TempData relies on the session and Id like to disable it if possible and use a different implementation of the TempDataProvider to get around not having a session. I have to use a different TempDataProvier because if I disable the session without changing the imlementation of TempData, the first time I try to use it Ill get an InvalidOperationException statingp  blockquote   pThe SessionStateTempDataProvider class requires session state to be   enabled.p blockquote  precodeltsystem.webgt   ltsessionState modeOffgt ltsystem.webgt codepre  pIve registered a new component with my Dependency Injector, StructureMap, and it looks like this.p  precodeI have tried this with and without the HttpContextScoped ForltITempDataProvidergt.HttpContextScoped.UseltCookieTempDataProvidergt ForltHttpContextBasegt.HttpContextScoped.Usex gt new HttpContextWrapperHttpContext.Current codepre  psI should mention my implementation of the CookieTempDataProvider a hrefhttpsgithub.comASPNETMVCaspnetwebstackblobmastersrcMicrosoft.Web.MvcCookieTempDataProvider.cs relnofollowis from hereas Apparently its been removed.p  pNow, This solves the exception when I try to use TempData now but my feedback doesnt show up. I thought maybe I broke something in my efforts so I commented out my DI lines and changed my session state mode back to codeInProccode, and tested it. My feedback shows up as expected after restarting IISExpress. I uncomment my injection lines, change session state to codeOffcode, and Im back to no feedback.p  pI did some further testing and found that if I do the following in my action I get no messagep  precodeTempData[message]  Person successfully updated. TempData[messageType]  success return RedirectToActionDetails, new  id  person.ObjectId  codepre  pBut if I ignore the PRG pattern, and instead do this then I see my feedback.p  precodeTempData[message]  Person successfully updated. TempData[messageType]  success return ViewEdit, person codepre  pSo my question is, is there a flaw with the commonly accepted CookieTempDataProvider or am I doing something wrongp

Negative 118 pJulian Day Numbers are a means of representing timestamps as a continuous count of days and fractional days since noon UTC, January 1, 4713 B.C.  The Java 7 SE API does not contain support for this format.  Developers who have used the SQLite database may have used the native Julian Day support provided by the strftime functions.p  pThe advantages of representing timestamps as Julian Day Numbers includep  ul liA date and time can be represented to millisecond precision in a primitive data type double  li liDays in a year are somewhat more concrete than seconds in a day  li liCircumvents the problem of leap seconds if this degree of precision is unimportantli liDays between dates arithmetic is trivial sorting precedence is easily determined  li liVery lightweightli ul  pDisadvantagesp  ul liThe Java DateTime API does not have builtin support for JDNsli liUnsuitable for very precise time measurementsli liOnly defined for UTC and must be mapped from UTC to local timeli liUnsuitable for display to endusers must be convertedformatted before displayli ul  pJulian Day Numbers are commonly used in astronomical calculations and their definition is highly standardized and accepted.  Similarly, Modified Julian Day Numbers which count from midnight UTC, 17 November 1858 are standardly defined and used in aerospace applications see a hrefhttptycho.usno.navy.milmjd.htmlhttptycho.usno.navy.milmjd.htmla.p  pFor applications that make extensive use of datetime arithmetic or chronological sorting or if persisting lightweight primitives is more appealing than persisting timestamps, internally representing dates and times as JDNs or MJDs may make sense for you.p  pThe following code defines functions that facilitate using either Julian Day Numbers or Modified Julian Day Numbers with the Java DateTimeCalendar API.

Negative 118 pThis has me stumped  The code is working so it is more of a mental challenge. I am trying to style an individual tab on a GWT TabBar. The setup of this widget is a tad peculiar  the Tab class is defined as an inner interface inside the TabBar class and it is implemented by an inner class also in TabBar called ClickDelegatePanel. The full code of TabBar is herep  pa hrefhttpscode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitsourcebrowsetrunkusersrccomgooglegwtuserclientuiTabBar.java relnofollowhttpscode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitsourcebrowsetrunkusersrccomgooglegwtuserclientuiTabBar.javaap  pThe key bits I think are the interface..p  precodepublic interface Tab extends HasAllKeyHandlers, HasClickHandlers, HasWordWrap  codepre  pand the implementation...p  precodeprivate class ClickDelegatePanel extends Composite implements Tab  codepre  pThe method to add a style is strongaddStyleNamestrong which is offered by UIObject, a parent of Composite. If I get a particular Tab from my TabBar and try to use this method, I get an error in Eclipse and a compilation error. Code is like this...p  precodeTab myTab  tabPanel.getTabBar.getTab3 myTab.addStyleNamegwtTabBarItemselected codepre  pBut if I upcast to UIObject, it works...p  precodeUIObject myTab  UIObject tabPanel.getTabBar.getTab3 myTab.addStyleNamegwtTabBarItemselected codepre  pEclipse even recognises this and offers a Quick Fix suggestion that does a more temporary upcast...p  precodeTab myTab  tabPanel.getTabBar.getTab3 UIObject myTab.addStyleNamegwtTabBarItemselected codepre  pIve had a good old Google and cant figure out what is going on. It shouldnt be possible to completely hide a superclass method, right Any discussion on upcasting seems to say its main use is to choose a superclass version of an overloaded method  but addStyleName isnt overloaded. I can only assume it has something to do with the way Tab is being defined, as an inner interface implemented by an inner class which extends the superclass Im after. So, what is happening here Why is using the interface type stopping me accessing superclass methods from the implementing classp

So call hangs for 1015 sec till connection will be closed by server EOF. In general Im fine with this behavior. p  pBut the problem is that this last readsome call on server socket blocks all new incoming connection from browser to be accepted by acceptor. New connections will not be accepted till readsome on server socket return EOF. p  pIve done a lot of experements already, and interesting thing is that the same blocking call on browser socket will not block other incoming connections to be accepted. if I will call p  pbsocket.readsome...p  pand there is no data to read and server keeping connection  then all new incoming connections accepted just fine.p  pI really cant understand why does it work in that way, I dont have any relations between server and browser socket in my implementation, they even initialized with different ioservice objects.p  pIs there anything wrong in my implementation Im facing exactly the same issue with async functions. Any tips would be helpful. p

Negative 118 pIn the paper ema hrefhttpwww.cs.indiana.edudybpubsfixingletrec.pdf relnofollowFixing Letrec A Faithful Yet Efficient Implementation of Schemes Recursive Binding Constructaem by Dybvig et al. it is said that emphasis mine p  blockquote   pA theoretical solution to these problems is to restrict codeletreccode so   that its lefthand sides are unassigned and righthand sides are codelambdacode   expressions. We refer to this form of codeletreccode as codefixcode, since it amounts to   a generalized form of fixpoint operator. The compiler can handle codefixcode   expressions efficiently, and there can be no violations of the codeletreccode   restriction with codefixcode. Unfortunately, restricting codeletreccode in this manner is not an option for the implementor strongand would in any case reduce the generality and convenience of the constructstrong.p blockquote  pI have not scrutinized the R5RS report, but I have used codeletreccode and the equivalent named codeletcode in Scheme programs and the unfortunate consequences mentioned in the paper are not clear to me, can someone enlighten me p

Negative 118 pHopefully this makes sense. I will probably just keep mulling this over, until i figure it. I have a table, that is formatted in such as way, that a specific date may have more than one record assigned. Each record is a plant, so the strucutre of that table looks like the pinkish table in the image below. However when using the Google chart API the data needs to be in the format in the blue table for a line chart. Which I have working.  I am looking to create a graph in the google chart api similar to the excel graph, using the pink table. Where at one date e.g. code01022003code there are three species recorded codeA,B,Ccode with values code1,2,3code. I thought possibly using a scatter but that didnt work either. p  pWhat ties these together is the codeCenterIDcode all these records belong to XXX codeCenterIDcode. Each record with its species has an SheetID that grouped them together for example codeSheetIDcode  23, all those species were recorded on the same date.p  pLooking for suggestions, whether google chart API or php amendments.

Negative 118 pI am building a set of Linux kernel modules using shared source code. From what I understand, the Makefile has to be named Makefile so I have to use the same Makefile to build two different modules. How can I build two different modules, within the same Makefile, with the same source code, but with two different build optionsp  pFor example, my modules are called module1 and module2. So I have the following line to define themp  precodeobjm  module1.o module2.o codepre  pAmong other files, both module1 and module2 need to use the same source file codecode.ccode, but built with different build options. So say for example, the Makefile contains the following linesp  precodemodule1objs  module1code.o othercode.o module2objs  module2code.o othercode.o codepre  pI want codemodule1code.ocode and codemodule2code.ocode to be built from code.c, but with different options. Specifically, I want one codemodule1code.ocode with a macro defined codeDPREPROCEFFORFLAG1code, and codemodule2code.ocode built without the macro.p  pFrom what I understand, the system of Makefiles used in Linux implicitly infers that for an object file called code.o, the source file is called code.c, so how would I achieve this Is is possible Is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 118 pLets say we have something like thisp  precodepublic abstract class MyClass      Stuff in here   public class MyClassA extends MyClass       private String thingie Along with gettersetters, of course     Other stuff   public class MyClassB extends MyClass       private ListltIntegergt thingies Again, getters and setters to go with     Other stuff  codepre  pLets assume we have any number of classes that extend MyClass, each with its own instance variable of a different type, although some may have the same type. This is an unfortunate necessity. Now, lets assume we have a Collection of MyClass. We have a collection filled with any number of child classes, each with an object contained within. Lets say I need to iterate over this Collection, retrieve said object from any number of elements, and perform actions upon it, store it, manipulate it, send it elsewhere, etc. These objects have nothing in common aside from extending Object.p  pI might be able to simply delegate these actions into the MyClass children themselves, use a visitor, etc, but this likely isnt feasible as these actions may be dependent upon other MyClass children in the Collection. A single MyClass child likely wont dictate the action to be taken all by itself, or even any single Collection of MyClass. Some of these actions may be cumulative and dependent upon a number of other potential cumulative factors.p  pIs there any good way to handle this, or am I just going to be cursed to the hell of ugly typechecking conditionals or something similar I considered using Generics in MyClass and using concrete types on all of the children. This could simplify the retrieval of objects, but would still necessitate a large conditional block.p

Negative 118 pI have an app that is using a Tab Bar.  My second view in the tab bar has 4 text inputs.  When the user hits the save button I want the the input from the text inputs to save to core data which I have done and then for the first view to appear.  The first view has a table view which displays the data.  I have been able to accomplish this but when I go back to the second view, the previous input is still in the text fields.  Even worse, if I try to save this data again it seems like I am trying to save the same instance to core data.  My app crashes whenever I have more than one row in the tableview, and I believe it is because of this problem.    p  pWhen I select Save on the second view, how do I get that view controller to unload so the next time I go to that view I start off with a clean instance  p
Negative 118 pSo Im writing a web app in vb.net and Ive found myself a bit conceptually stumped with a particular database issue.p  pEssentially, I have 2 different templates for a form. In one, the user fills in a bunch of text fields and submits it, and its all shipped off to the database. The second template is identical, except it tracks some additional information, so it submits more to the database. Rather than have a pair of tables with a lot of duplicate columns or a single table with a bunch of nulls, I made 1 table that tracks all the information shared by both templates and another table that stores all the extra stuff the 2nd template has.p  pThe problem this has created is I need a way to pair the data from the two back together in order to search for the form and then pull the information out of the database. The collective forms are identified by a surrogate autoincrementing key which is the primary key of the shared table. I attempted to set up a foreign key relationship with the extra stuff table, but doing so raised an issue on the application side where Im not sure how to handle a foreign key that references an autoincrement in my insert statement. p  pTo give a code examplep  precode    Dim sInsertInto As String     sInsertInto  INSERT INTO 5why date, opid, serial, why1, why2, why3, why4, why5, rootcause, othernotes, lessons, define, template VALUES          fdate  ,           fusr  ,           fpartnum  ,           ffirst  ,           fsecond  ,           fthird  ,           ffourth  ,           ffifth  ,           froot  ,           fnotes  ,           flessons  ,           fdefine  ,           ftemp               Dim sInsertInto2 As String     sInsertInto2  INSERT INTO 5whymbusi countermeasure, containment, checkit, standardizecounter, pointcause, methodprocedure, groupleader, engineer, shopam, shopmanager VALUES          fcounter  ,           fcontainment  ,           fcheck  ,           fstandardCounter  ,           fpointOfCause  ,           fmethodAndProc  ,           fgroupLeader  ,           fengineer  ,           fshopAM  ,           fshopManager  ,         codepre  pIn the first insert statement Im inserting all the shared information into the shared table. I dont have to worry about the autoincrement here because its all being handled by the database. The second insert statement ships all the extras into the extra stuff table, but I cant insert all those things without figuring out something to put into the foreign key, as it cant be null for the purposes of establishing a relationship between the two sets of data. Im operating under the impression that just setting the foreign key to AI as well would just start it back over at 1, it wouldnt match the AI being generated by the shared table.p  pAny ideas out there on how to handle it This was kind of tricky to word, so if you need clarification about anything, let me know and Ill do my best to clear it up.p

By now i used a simple shell script wich clones my two git repositories one for grails app, one for the inplace plugin my grails app depends on in the same folder and runs grails prod war to create the war file.p  pI could get the grails build working in jenkins with grails plugin but how can i configure jenkins to clone the second repository with my inplace plugin beside my main project so that the grails prod war process just uses the sources of the plugin too because its referred in BuildConfig.groovyp  pHow can i get this workingp
Negative 118 pWe need to add two columns in each table  createddate and updateddate. The type of database can be any of the following Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB.p  pThe two columns should store the date as well as the time. createddate should be filled only when a row is created. updateddate should be filled every time a row is updated during creation time too.p  pThe solution is for a cloud where a lot of Hibernate JVMs will be running. Since there is no single JVM, they may occasionally go out of sync in time. So we do NOT want the solution to populate JVM time in these two columns.p  pIs there a DBagnostic way to do this in Hibernate We would like to put the responsibility of date creationupdation on the DB itself. Triggers would be the last option we want to try as that would be cumbersome to generate for each table.p  pIdeal solution would be to have some kind of annotation in JPAHibernate which will dictate the ORM tool to create or update the date from DB during insertupdate.p

Negative 118 pI have two Microsoft Access database tables.  They are named codeHistoricalStockPricescode and codeBalanceSheetscode.

Negative 118 pIm working with quite specific web API that uses TCP and SSL stream.

For examplep  precodepublic async Taskltboolgt Authenticatestring clientId, string clientSecret      await SendAuthMessageOverNetworkclientId, clientSecret     return await ReceiveAuthResponseFromServer      The problem is that there is no ReceiveAuthResponseFromServer method        the response is received in reading thread Listen.  codepre  pIm not quite familiar with TPL yet. I solved this problem by using a Task which actually does not do anything but wait a signal AutoResetEvent from the reading threadp  precodeprivate AutoResetEvent loginEvent private bool loginResult  public async Taskltboolgt Authenticatestring clientId, string clientSecret      await SendAuthMessageOverNetworkclientId, clientSecret     return await Taskltboolgt.Factory.StartNew gt  loginEvent.WaitOne return loginResult    private void Listen      ...     if msg.Type  MessageTypes.AuthenticationResponse              loginResult  true         loginEvent.Set          ...  codepre  pBut I dont quite like this solution.

Negative 118 pI am have set an codeaddimagesizecode function that is often larger in only one dimension than the uploaded image.  This results in an image that has one dimension cropped and one dimension that remains uncropped resulting in an image that loses its proportions.

Negative 118 pObjectiveCARCmemory managements questions have been done to death on SO, but this one seems slightly different to the existing ones.p  pIve been trying to use ObjectiveC with GNUStep and Clang. Ive downloaded the libraries  apparently required for modern ObjectiveC features like ARC blocks work and codeautoreleasepoolcodes are accepted by the compiler along with the associated compiler flag. The AppKit GUI toolkit works, and so does the queue dispatcher.p  pMy understanding, if correct, is that codealloccodeed objects are automatically set up to release upon the exiting of a codeautoreleasepoolcode of a parent stack frame, and that releasing decrements a reference count. Yet the compiler doesnt bemoan a manual code[super dealloc]code and tolerates manual codeautoreleasescode and codereleasescode, which implies that ARC isnt even switched on.p  pOne might imagine that Googling codeGNUStep ARC enablecode would yield some compiler flag that Im missing out, but it doesnt.p  pHeres some example code. Its an object wrapper around a multiple dimensional array of C99 codeboolcodes, which is codemalloccodeed in codeinitcode and codefreecoded within codedealloccode, which I gather is one of the few legitimate uses of codedealloccode within ARC code. Notice that codedealloccodes codeputscode is strongnotstrong called after the autoreleasepool finishes, despite there only being a single reference created within it. A manual codereleasecode or codeautoreleasecode, however, works great.p  precodeimport ltstdbool.hgt import ltstdio.hgt import ltstdlib.hgt  import ltFoundationFoundation.hgt  interface Area  NSObject      bool area     sizet width, height    id initWithWidthsizetaWidth heightsizetaHeight  void dealloc  void display end  implementation Area   id initWithWidthsizetaWidth heightsizetaHeight      self  [super init]     width  aWidth     height  aHeight     area  mallocsizeof area  aWidth  aHeight      for sizet y  0 y lt aHeight y          for sizet x  0 x lt aWidth x              area[aHeight  y  aWidth  x]  true                    return self    void dealloc      freearea     putsDEALLOCATED    void display      for sizet y  0 y lt height y          putchar         for sizet x  0 x lt width x              putchararea[height  y  width  x]                                                               puts        end  int mainvoid      autoreleasepool          id area  [[Area alloc] initWithWidth10 height10]         [area display]          return EXITSUCCESS  codepre  pMy compiling script Ill use a proper makefile once Ive got this workingp  precodebinsh  INCFLAGgnustepconfig variableGNUSTEPSYSTEMHEADERS LIBFLAGgnustepconfig variableGNUSTEPSYSTEMLIBRARIES  clang o main main.m      I INCFLAG      L LIBFLAG           fblocks      fobjarc      fconstantstringclassNSConstantString      DNATIVEOBJCEXCEPTIONS           pthread      lgnustepbase      ldispatch      lgnustepgui      lobjc codepre  pIve been under the assumption that codeautoreleasecode should be inferred for objects created within codeautoreleasepoolcode.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 118 pCurrently, Im working on a Rails project where I use a BootstrapTheme CSSFiles, JavaScriptFiles and so on which Ive included as a Gem in the rails project.p  pThe Markup in the views is dependent on this BootstrapTheme. We have other RailsEngines included in this project which also depends on the markup of this Gem for the views.p  pWhat we want to do is to develop a TemplatingSystem. Lets say we have a defined box, which has a header and a body. Then if the BootstrapTheme is included, it attaches the appropriate Bootstrap Markup. If another Theme is used, the appropriate markup will be attached for this Theme.p  pRight now, if we want to exchange the BootstrapTemplate in the future with a e.g. ZurbFoundationTemplate. Then were lost, because we have to refactor each and every view and replace the BootstrapLike Markup with the Zurb one.p  pThe first idea was to develop this templating in JavaScript which will change the CSSClasses on document ready, but this is not capable to handle large DOM trees.p  pAre there any Gems available for this purposes How can such a system be implemented in Ruby  Railsp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 118 pI am trying to submit an update to the iOS app store. I am going from a Buzztouch app to a Sprite Kit app. I am able to archive the Xcode project and submit it.

Verify that the code signing settings in Xcode are correct at the target level which override any values at the project level. Additionally, make sure the bundle you are uploading was built using a Release target in Xcode, not a Simulator target. If you are certain your code signing settings are correct, choose Clean All in Xcode, delete the build directory in the Finder, and rebuild your release target.p      pOnce these issues have been corrected, go to the Version Details page and click Ready to Upload Binary. Continue through the submission process until the app status is Waiting for Upload. You can then deliver the corrected binary.p blockquote  pI have cleaned out the build directory, rebuilt my release target, and made new provisioning profiles multiple times. All of the Code Signing Identities are set to iOS Developer. Code signing and the provisioning profiles have always been a little bit confusing to me, I could have made some obvious mistakes.p  pI have tried submitting over 50 times I find this very frustrating because I have emailed Apple and they got back to me but it was just a link to the dev center with code signing information. I have also spent lots of time searching the Internet to find a solution to this and there hasnt been a good solution that actually works for this problem.p  pThe only thing I can think of is either because I am changing from a a hrefhttpbuzztouch.com relnofollowBuzztoucha app or it is Sprite Kit.p  pHere is a screenshot of my code signingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJBFGK.png altscreenshot of code signingp

Negative 118 pMy project consists of displaying a document in a UITextView.  Most of the document is pretty straight forward attributed text and I have that working just fine.  There are other parts of the document that consist of normal text and then a 3 column table with 2 or 3 rows basically right in the middle of the normal text.p  pAfter spending a fair amount of time searching the web I cant seem to find any reference to anyone doing anything like this.p  pBased on some tutorials I have read, I was thinking that maybe there was a way to create a subview consisting of a bunch of UILabels that would be subviews of a UIView Well call it codetabularViewcodethat I could layout on top of the UITextView.  Then I could somehow position the frame of codetabularViewcode to the character range in the UITextView where it is supposed to be.  I could then use an exclusion path to keep the text from going under the view.  My only problem is that I am not exactly sure how to go about doing this and I am also worried that it wouldnt scroll with the rest of the content.p  pMy question is, does anyone have any suggestions on how to accomplish this or a suggestion for a better way to embed a table in a UITextView.p
Negative 118 pSo this question basically is the first of more to follow once I figured out what really goes on. I read a lot about encoding decoding and XML standarts, but I did not find an answer to this specific topic.p  precodeimport elementtree.ElementTree as ET  root  ET.ElementPrfung main  ET.SubElementroot,Test main.textxe4 .decodeUTF8 treeET.ElementTreeroot tree.writetestout.xml codepre  pMy first question is in the codemain.textxe4 .decodeUTF8code line. I understand, that xe4 is the code for the letter , so does this mean, that I have to decode every string passed to my interpreter as utf8 in order to work properly Because when I read special characters from a .txt file using pythons readline method, they seem to be already decoded correctly. p  pA related but slightly different question is the line coderoot  ET.ElementPrfungcode. It seems not to be possible to use nonASCII characters in XML Tags at least not with element tree. Is this because of the XML standart or basically just another decodingencoding problemp

Negative 118 pJust searched the Linux kernel for vdso hooks e.g. found a hrefhttpsgit.kernel.orgcgitlinuxkernelgithpalinuxx86syscalls.gittreearchx86vdsovdso.lds.S relnofollowthisa at kernel.org, and it seems to be currently used mostly for timerelated system calls. This brings two questions to mindp  ul liAre there any other system calls that are planned to use vDSO interface soon li liWere clockgettime really becoming a large enough bottleneck to motivate the design of vDSO Is there any particular kind of application for which this was helpful If so, what kind of application and by how muchli ul  pIt just seemed odd to design a new kernel syscall interface for just time lookups. I am guessing it helps highperformance servers for things like timestamping requestresponses and logs. But I want to know if anybody here has more concrete details than just guesses.p

Negative 118 pI want to keep various data sources in sync. To do that I want to broadcast change events using an event hub. So in this structure every data source can be a publisher and a subscriber of events either. Currently I dont have an implementation, I am just thinking on how to do that.p  pI have problem to figure out how to prevent event reflection infinite loop in other terms. So by a data sourcep  precodegt ds.change gt hub.publishds, event gt hub.subscriber[x]  ds.syncevent gt ds.change gt ... infinite loop caused by sync triggered change event codepre  pThis is a basic reflection in my terms, this can be avoided by simply ignoring the same events from the same ds data source on the hub until the current event handling process is done. But how should we know when it is donep  pBy sync code we can simply cover the process with a transaction and check if the current ds is already synchronized or not. If yes then ignore it. What if we have 2 hubs synchronizing the same 2 data sourcesp  precodegt ds.change gt hub1.publishds, event gt hub.subscriber[x]  ds2.syncevent gt ds2.change gt hub2.publishds2, event2 gt hub2.subscriber[x]  ds.syncevent2 gt ds.change gt ... infinite loop caused by signal sent back by the other hub codepre  pSo we have to cover the 2 hubs with the same transaction. So we have to use some sort of global transaction.p  pNow all of these can be solved more or less with a sync code. But what about an async code How can I end a transaction if I cannot determine exactly when I should do that Ending a transaction too early or too late would cause an invalid application state. Adding a transaction id to the events and never ending the transaction would cause a memory leak. Any ideap  h2Conclusionh2  pThe async part of the problem is very hard and it is more about concurrent threads, thread safety and parallel programming then simple event handling. So I decided to accept T.J. Crowders answer, because it is a genius idea to compare the values instead of creating a global transaction object. If you have a general solution for the async part of the problem, please share it with usp  pI asked the same question on here a hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions241599howtoavoidoscillationbyasynceventbasedsystemshttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions241599howtoavoidoscillationbyasynceventbasedsystemsa and I got there a more general answer about how to prevent state oscillations.p

Negative 118 pI have an interesting bug and interested to see possible solutions.  Heres the situation I have a user table userid, firstname, lastname. I have an address table userid, address. Its possible for 1 user to have multiple addresses.p  pI want a set of results like useruserid, addressaddressarray  if a user has more than 1 address, its grouped.p  pIve done this by fetching everything sorted by userid, then traverse the results.p  precodefor every item in results      if current result.userid equal to previous one              append the address to previous user          else              add the new one to my return array       codepre  pThis seems to work fine, except now I want to introduce LIMIT.  e.g, I only want the first 20 users.  When the client presses NEXT, it skips the first 20 and grabs the next 20 records.p  pIssue isp  precord 19 user 19 has address 1p  precord 20 user 19 has address 2p  precord 21 user 19 has address 3p  precord 22 user 19 has address 4p  pThe way Ive done it now, the first batch of 20 will only show that user 19 only has 2 addresses.  Then, when the client asks for the next 20 results, user 19 will show up again with 2 other addresses.p  pAdditionally, I cant do array.length to tell the database how many records to skip.  I would need to count now many addresses there are.  Seems like not an elegant way to do it as the code needs to understand how the database is laid out.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 118 pI am writing a class which can be instantiated in different modes. A simple case maybe a meancomputer which can compute different types of means based on the mode.p  pThe class will be instantiated by some other piece of code, and the class code will be generic through function pointers. The specific functions associated with different modes have to be defined and pointers set as per the mode.p  pWhat i have looks like thisp  precode    enum StatMode  EMA, SMA       class MeanComputer      public         MeanComputer          MeanComputer const MeanComputeramp orig         virtual MeanComputer         template ltStatModegt double Update double x         template ltStatModegt double Sample double x         void Reset         void setFunction               if mode  EMA  docalc  EMA mode function                     double MeanComputerdocalcdouble      private         stdvector ltdoublegt window          double mean          double variance          StatMode mode           template ltStatMode SMAgt double MeanComputerUpdatedouble x             template ltStatMode EMAgt double MeanComputerUpdatedouble x       codepre  pHowever this doesnt seem to compile and gives error error no matching function for call to MeanComputerUpdatedoubleampp  pHow do I make this work. I understand one way is to have each such mode function defined by different names, and set  the function pointer then. Though that seems to require too much naming, and having cleaner mode template functions seem to be more elegant and easier to understand.p  pUPDATE The method of calculating is not set at compile time, but at runtime. however for a given object of the class the mode remains the same, so setting the pointers accordingly will do it once and for all. Also virtual base class also works, but in the actual case a lot of computation is generic, and only some specific or small functions depend on mode. A contrived example maybe the meancomputer takes the update of some kind of coordinate object, and it takes a pair of mode types, the SMAEMA and latitudelongitude. So one instance maybe a a longitude mean while other is a latitude mean. The full computation is same , just one reads the different member.p

Negative 118 pImagine such a functionp  precodebar  Foo gt A gt B gt C gt IO  codepre  pThat function performs some codeIOcode stuff using a codeFoocode and other values. The codeFoocode value has to be passed to codebarcode, and can be retrieved from codeIOcode via thisp  precodefoo  X gt IO Foo codepre  pNow, codeAcode, codeBcode, codeCcode and codeXcode are all plain pure values. Id rather like such a codebarcode functionp  precodebar  X gt A gt B gt C gt IO  codepre  pAnd codeFoocode would be generated in the codebarcode function using the codeXcode value. If I do that p  precodelet f  bar myX codepre  pcodef  A gt B gt C gt IO code. If I call that function several times, the codeXcode value remains the same because of partial application, but since its an codeIOcode effect, it will be generated each time. Is there a emnativeem, embuiltinghcem way to perform some kind of caching so that the codeFoocode value is generated once  for the generated closure I guess its all boxingrelated, but Inever figured out how to do that without using dirty codeIORefcode, expanding the parameters of codebarcode, which is ugly.p

Negative 118 pWe have an application which will need to store thousands of fairly small CSV files. 100,000 and growing annually by the same amount.  Each file contains around 2080KB of vehicle tracking data.  Each data set or file represents a single vehicle journey. p  pWe are currently storing this information in SQL Server, but the size of the database is getting a little unwieldy and we only ever need to access the journey data one file at time so the need to query it in bulk or otherwise store in a relational database is not needed. The performance of the database is degrading as we add more tracks, due to the time taken to rebuild or update indexes when inserting or deleting data.p  pThere are 3 options we are consideringp  ol lipWe could use the FILESTREAM feature of SQL to externalise the data into files, but Ive not used this feature before.  Would Filestream still result in one physical file per database object blobpli lipAlternatively, we could store the files individually on disk. There could end being half a million of them after 3 years.  Will the NTFS file system cope OK with this amountpli lipIf lots of files is a problem, should we consider grouping the datasetsfiles into a small database one peruser so that each user Is there a very lightweight database like SQLite that can store filespli ol  pOne further point the data is highly compressible. Zipping the files reduces them to only 10 of their original size. I would like to utilise compression if possible to minimise disk space used and backup size. p

Negative 118 pI have developed an angular web application using ngbp. The first view displayed is a login page. The login page does not contain any dynamic content. The problem is when the page is rendered it seems like everything is loaded and there is a slight delay until the text appears on the page a split second, in slower connection, sometimes on mobile, it can take up to 5 seconds. Everything that is text, seems to appear with a slight delay. Is there anyone that encountered this problem  To clarify the text is just text in the html, not dynamic content.p

Negative 118 pJavaScript uses a Prototype system, which is fundamentally different than a Class system. This is my first serious encounter with the language. I had fooled around with it previously, but this is the first time I built a system with proper OO, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.p  pFrom what I read there seems to be a few common methods to do member function inheritance in Javascript. Assuming you have a parent codefoocode as followingp  precodefoo  function this.one  1  foo.prototype.func1  functionreturn this.one codepre  pThe a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptIntroductiontoObjectOrientedJavaScript relnofollowMDN Introduction to JavaScript Inheritancea suggests the naive  approach of invoking the parents method in the context of the child, as shown below.p  precodebar  function foo.callthis  bar.prototype  Object.createfoo.prototype bar.prototype.func1  function return this.one  foo.prototype.func1 codepre  pThis has the advantage of being simple to understand, but can become cumbersome as pointed out in a hrefhttpblog.salsify.comengineeringsupermethodsinjavascript relnofollowthis Salsify Blog posta. The blog post outlines an alternate method where a codesupercode property is defined in the child prototype, and the name of each member function is attached as a property to the method. This method, however, relies on the codecallercode property of a method, which the article points out will soon be deprecated. Rather than duplicate the entire post, I believe a summary of the important points are thesep  precodeObject.definePropertybar.prototype, super,   get function get    ...    methodName is set as a property on each method in an omitted code segment   methodName  get.caller.methodName    ...   Object.getPrototypeOfthis.prototype[methodName]    codepre  pWhich is to say that you find the method with the same name in your prototypes prototype.

It is not threadsafe since some state is held in a what is effectively a static variable of the function. This is fine for my purposes since browsers still have single threaded JavaScript.

Negative 118 pI have a calendar for a conference room shared with me. What I am hoping to do is to use phpews to pull that calendar schedule for display. So far, I have been able to easily display my OWN calendar without issue. This was done using the code at a hrefhttpsgithub.comjamesiarmesphpewswikiCalendarGetListRetrievingIdandChangeKey relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjamesiarmesphpewswikiCalendarGetListRetrievingIdandChangeKeyap  pI saw on a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24609527phpewsaccesssharedcalendarsphpews Access shared calendarsa someone suggesting adding these lines in the Only look in the calendars folder sectionp  precoderequestgtParentFolderIdsgtDistinguishedFolderIdgtMailbox  new StdClass requestgtParentFolderIdsgtDistinguishedFolderIdgtMailboxgtEmailAddress  emailaddress.com     codepre  pThis didnt break the code or anything, but it also didnt change the results. I was still only given my own calendar as a result. I have seen mention of impersonation as one method, but since the calendar is shared with me already I dont think that should be necessary. Is there something I have overlooked I do have the identity path of the calendar, which is replacing identifying details with words in CAPS      DOMAIN.comOUUSERNAMEcalendarNAME OF CALENDAR    p  pI hope this is enough to help solve the problem. There are a couple questions on stack overflow dealing with this but without answers that solved my issue, so if we get it sorted I will be sure to pass on the solution to those locations as well. p
Negative 118 pI have an asp mvc application that requires very low level authentication and login functionality. The user has a unique 7 digit number in which they will enter to log into the application. Once authenticated they are able to edit an EF db. Thats itp  pCurrently I am using a basic implementation of Owin to authenticate and sign in the user. Basically I have an input field where the user enters their number and then I look it up using EF, if I find the number I create a claim and sign them in.p  pI am quite new to this and I do not see the benefits of using the Asp Identity system as I do not need external login capability or registration functionality. Additionally I do not have user profiles. I simply need a way to check these numbers to identify the user is in a DB and then sign them in. So the questions are is my implementation of only Owin valid And why would I need the asp Identity framework herep  precode[HttpPost, AllowAnonymous, ValidateInputtrue]         public ActionResult IndexemployeePSDB lookUpEmployeeID                      if ModelState.IsValid                              using var db  new PsEntities                                      IEnumerableltemployeePSDBgt foundEmployeeInDb  db.employeePSDBs.WherefoundEmployee gt lookUpEmployeeID.EmployeeNumber  foundEmployee.EmployeeNumber                       if foundEmployeeInDb.Count gt 0                                              var identity  new ClaimsIdentitynew[]                              new ClaimClaimTypes.Name, foundEmployeeInDb.First.EmployeeNumber.ToString                         , ApplicationCookie                          var contex  Request.GetOwinContext                         var authManager  contex.Authentication                            authManager.SignInidentity                         return RedirectGetRedirectUrllookUpEmployeeID.ReturnUrl                                                      user authN failed or ModelState is not valid         ModelState.AddModelError, Not in db         employeePSDB newLookUp  new employeePSDB                      ReturnUrl  lookUpEmployeeID.ReturnUrl                  return ViewnewLookUp      codepre
Negative 118 pEDIT Advantages and disadvantages of both methods. SO, I have three models Person, Client, Member Person is a base model, Client and Member are profiles for Person.p  precodeclass PersonAbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin     email  models.EmailField         verbosenameemail address,         maxlength255,         uniqueTrue,       class ClientUser or maybe models.Model and explicit OneToField      firstname  models.CharFieldverbosenamefirst name, maxlength30     lastname  models.CharFieldverbosenamelast name, maxlength30  class MemberUser or maybe models.Model and explicit OneToField      description  models.CharFieldverbosenamefirst name, maxlength255     other stuff codepre  pSo, what I wantp  ol lipIn admin, when we add client or member, I want to fill field email fields from base class as if it was in derived class. For example, in admin listdisplay  email, firstname. Not select boxes for user.pli lipPerson class can be instantiated separately and the attached to the created profiel. Like personPersonemailtestgmail.com, client  Clientpersonperson,firstnametest.... Especially, this should work in forms. When user person is authenticated I want to give ability to fill in profile client form and attach person to this form.pli lipOne person can have both accounts. If I delete clientmember, corresponding person should not be deleted.pli ol  p3rd option actually is not necessary, but it is useful for me to know how to do it.p  pSo, option 1 is perfectly solved by inheritance, codePersoncode is codeUsercode, but this approach fails when option 2 is implemented. Since codePersoncode and codeClientcode are considered as one whole, I cant attach user, duplicate key error.p  pOption 2 is resolved by extending models.Model and appending codepersonmodels.OnetoOneFieldPerson,primarykeyTruecode. However, admin is broken 1st option, because Client dont have fields like email.p  pSo, what approach to take in order to solve above issues Are there simple ways If there are no simple ways, is there advanced way, like overriding metaclass, object descriptors or writing custom OneToOne fieldp  pAny suggestions are welcomed.p  pThank you. p

Negative 118 pWe have and EDI application that uses a MySQL back end to store all of the relevant records. The EDI application use a drag and drop style wizard to create the SQL statement so it is very limited in what can be created. This is fine for the existing requirement, which is just to extract the customer purchase order header and line information. It just requires the simple join between header and line tables.p  precodeSELECT       dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.Buyfrom Vendor No AS CustInternalShipToRef,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.No AS CustPONumber,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Line No AS POLineItemNumber,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Vendor Item No AS IntProductCode,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.No AS CustomerProductCode,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Quantity AS Quantity,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Unit of Measure AS OrderQuantityUOM ,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Expected Receipt Date AS RequestedDeliveryDate,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Direct Unit Cost AS PricePerUnit, FROM       dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line, WHERE      dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.Nodbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Document No      AND dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.Buyfrom Vendor No Like AJAX      AND dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.Order Date gt getdate2      AND dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.Status  1      AND dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Quantity gt 0 codepre  pNow we have a need to include a 3rd table, which is also possible with the existing wizard, but we cant use an inner join as the 3rd table doesnt have a matching record for every one of the records in the 1st table. So now I need to convert the old style SQL to the current syntax and include more explicit join logic.p  pThe outcome I am trying to achieve is to display ALL the existing fields from the SELECT section as per the criteria in the WHERE section and then display header comments from the purchase order comments table IF they exist.p  pI have been looking through posts on here to try to get at least a starting point. So I have put together the below statement and am looking to get some feedback on whether the logic I have used will achieve the outcome I am looking for above. Also not sure if I should be using just LEFT JOIN or LEFT OUTER JOIN.p  precodeSELECT       dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.Buyfrom Vendor No AS CustInternalShipToRef,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.No AS CustPONumber,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Line No AS POLineItemNumber,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Vendor Item No AS IntProductCode,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.No AS CustomerProductCode,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Quantity AS Quantity,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Unit of Measure AS OrderQuantityUOM ,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Expected Receipt Date AS RequestedDeliveryDate,     dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Direct Unit Cost AS PricePerUnit,     dbo.Supplier livePurch Comment Line.Comment AS OrderComments FROM       dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header     LEFT JOIN          dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header INNER JOIN dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line ON dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.Nodbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Document No         AND dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.Buyfrom Vendor No Like AJAX         AND dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.Order Date gt getdate2         AND dbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.Status  1         AND dbo.Supplier livePurchase Line.Quantity gt 0      ON dbo.Supplier livePurch Comment Line.Nodbo.Supplier livePurchase Header.No codepre

Negative 118 pIm trying to pass a binary string which represents a file from classic ASP vbscript to a .Net method.  This is of course, very simple indeed.  Testing with a simple txt file, we find that the data can be reliably passed to .Net and worked with.p  pHowever, as soon as we get to files which include chars in the unicode range, we see that they are routinely converted to different characters and therefore the file is corrupted.

Negative 118 pI was hoping to get some help regarding the good practice automake based, toolkit build compile procedure. I am writing a toolkit which consists of several external and couple of internal libraries together with demo tools. Until now I was doing my own makefile scripts to compile it but now I would like to switch to autotools, that is I would like to move from my wanky scripts to something more standardized. So what I am looking for is some help, a minimum example which I could study. This minimum example should be in accord to good practice principles and preserve the following tree structure p  precodetoolkitsrclibint      libinternal.cpp libinternal.hpp  toolkitsrclibext      externallib  toolkitbin      my binaries  toolkitdemotool1      tool1.cpp tool1.hpp  toolkitdemotool2      tool2.cpp tool2.hpp  toolkitlib      libinternal.a libexternal.a  toolkitincludelibint      libinternal.hpp  toolkitincludelibext      libexternal.hpp  codepre  pUsually I have my demo tools in demo folder under separate subfolders which are compiled using headers and libraries from include and lib folders. This means that in my makefile I usually first compile  libraries into include and lib folder and then demo tools while building the toolkit. p  pCould anyone provide a minimal example for required configure.ac and Makefile.am files for the above tree source structure any suggestions regarding the source tree are more then welcomed p  pthank you p

Negative 118 pI want to add a bar button item on the navigation bar. Say View 1 here. The view that will segue to View 1 is embedded in a navigation controller.p  pHowever, the navigation bar is not showing in this view.p  pIf I use attribute inspector to add a opaque translucent navigation bar, there will be a navigation bar in View 1. But if I drag in a bar button item, it cannot be shown in the storyboard. Though the bar button is in the document outline, it cannot be shown on the storyboard. Also, if I run the application, it is not on the screen.p  pWhen running the application in the simulator, View 1 will have a navigation bar on the top of it, since I use Show rather than Show Details to show View 1. I tried to embed View 1 in a navigation controller again, but it wont help much. p  pCan anyone tell me how to add a bar button in this situation strongusing storyboardstrong And why the navigation bar is missing from the storyboardp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 118 pWhat I need to do is to store onetoone map. Basically, lots 10M of keyvalue pairs of the same nature.

Would it be a viable solution to mmap 1GB of memory at the start  Presumably, while only 10MB is being used, the remaining 990MB is available to other applications.  When the rare occasion occurs that 1GB is needed, I assume there would be much less delay than having to malloc or realloc.p  pWhen the extra 990MB is no longer needed, would it be a viable solution to mremap to 10MB and then back to 1GB so as to release the 990MB that is no longer immediately needed, but still provide instant access to it for next time  I assume this would be much faster than a realloc operationp  pSome of all of my assumptions here may be incorrect.  I am trying to gain a better understanding of how mmap affects free memory, and the performance implications of mremap vs using malloc and realloc.p  pThe above is based on a modern linux kernel, using gcc, assuming a 4k page size and portability beyond that, not a significant priority.p

Negative 118 pI am trying to solve the programming challenge outlined below, wherein basically you need to find the word in a given sentence with the greatest number of repeated characters. I have struggled a bit with this, and was lucky enough to find some code for counting the occurrences of letters in a string also below. This particular piece of code store all the letters in a HashMap, and I need to tailor it so that it stores the character occurrence of each word separately instead of in aggregate, as its doing at the moment. This is where I am stuck. What could I use to store the state of a HashMap with each iteration of its loopp  precode Using the Java language, have the function LetterCountIstr take    the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the    greatest number of repeated letters. For example Today, is the    greatest day ever should return greatest because it has 2 es    and 2 ts and it comes before ever which also has 2 es. If there    are no words with repeating letters return 1.

Negative 118 pSay for example we have an element lets call it contactbox that is always on the right of the page and we want a series of different width images to run along side its left hand side. The right hand edge of each image should always be 20px from the left hand edge of the contactbox. p  pIf we know the width and positioning of the contactbox and we set the right attribute on the images then it calculates from the left hand edge of the image rather than the right. This is not going to achieve the desired result as the images are of variable width. p  pIs there a way to switch this behaviour on a per element basis to flow from right to left instead or is the only way to grok it in javascript p  pEdit To be clear  The the right edge of the images align 20px to the left of the left edge of the contactbox container element.

Negative 118 pI came to know that PostgreSQL pagination using strongLIMIT and OFFSETstrong is damn slow, unfortunately, its very late to me to understand this, because one of my small web app project uses it as the DB and the development is almost over.p  pI have seen a few workarounds in SO and other sites, but all of them uses extra indexes and things like that. But it does not suit me because I will have to create many indexes there are a few dozens of tables for the tables and will also have to rewrite the queries. So my question is p  ol lipIs there a way I can avoid this without spending more time creating those extra indexes and rewriting query, etc  I mean, a simple workaround pli lipI have not felt this slow with MySQL and I guess, so is Oracle, hence, will PostgreSQL people be improving that in future versions  or wont they do it at all  If they have a plan, I would like to keep on with PostgreSQL, if not I would go for MySQL, because a typical web appERP will have a lot of pagination requirements, and it is not wise to do extra work for this basic needpli ol

Negative 118 pI am interested in using Rcpp to create a data frame with a variable number of columns. By that, I mean that the number of columns will be known only at runtime. Some of the columns will be standard, but others will be repeated n times where n is the number of features I am considering in a particular run.p  pI am aware that I can create a data frame as followsp  precodeIntegerVector i13 i1[0]4i1[1]2134i1[2]3453 IntegerVector i23 i2[0]4123i2[1]343i2[2]99123 DataFrame df  DataFramecreateNamedV1i1,NamedV2i2 codepre  pbut in this case it is assumed that the number of columns is 2. p  pTo simplify the explanation of what I need, assume that I would like pass a SEXP variable specifying the number of columns to create in the variable part. Something likep  precodeRcppExport SEXP myFuncSEXP n, SEXP ltother stuffgt IntegerVector i13 ltcompute i1gt IntegerVector i23 ltcompute i2gt forint i0iltnicompute vi DataFrame df  DataFramecreateNamedNumi1,NamedIDi2,...,other columns v1 to vn codepre  pwhere n is passed as an argument.

Negative 118 pI have a RemoteServiceServlet class implements several services methods. All the methods need to check the session and get the corresponding user info before doing anything.

Negative 118 pstrongQUESTION SUMMARYstrongp  pemI have a [5 x 72580] matrix. I am trying to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model GMM to this data using the gmmdiag.learn method with randomsubset as the initial seeding mode. Why does Armadillo display gmmdiaglearn no existing means and fail to learn the modelemp  hr  pstrongPROBLEM DETAILSstrongp  pI am working on a machine learning algorithm, the aim of which is to identify a writer from their handwriting. I am using supervised learning to train our model with a GMM.p  pAll the training data is read from XML files. After calculating the features, their values are stored into a linked list. After this, the number of elements in the list is counted and is used to initialize an Armadillo matrix variable at runtime as shown belowp  precodeint totFeatureVectors  CountPointClusterElementsTRAININGCLUSTERLISTINDEX printfnd elements added to listn,totFeatureVectors  mat F  matNUMPOINTBASEDFEATURES, totFeatureVectors, fillzeros codepre  pHere TRAININGCLUSTERLISTINDEX and NUMPOINTBASEDFEATURES are a couple of configurable, project level constants for my program NUMPOINTBASEDFEATURES  5 and totFeatureVectors  72580. So the variable F is a [5 x 72580] dimensional matrix of double values. After initialization, I am reading the feature values from the linked list into F as followsp  precodeint rowInd0, colInd0 PointClusterElement iterator  allClusterPointsList whileiteratorNULL      FrowInd,colInditeratorgtpointSample.speed     rowInd  1     FrowInd,colInditeratorgtpointSample.dirn.cosComponent     rowInd  1     FrowInd,colInditeratorgtpointSample.dirn.sinComponent     rowInd  1     FrowInd,colInditeratorgtpointSample.curv.cosComponent     rowInd  1     FrowInd,colInditeratorgtpointSample.curv.sinComponent     rowInd  1     ifrowIndNUMPOINTBASEDFEATURES              rowInd0         colInd  1          iteratoriteratorgtnextClusterElement  codepre  pThe assignment of feature values to locations in F is being made in a column major manner i.e. each column of F represents a feature vector post assignment. I am even writing the values of F into a text file to verify that all the feature values have been properly set and yes, it is happening without any problemsp  precodeFILE fp  fopenPROGRAMDATAOUTPUTPATH,w iffpNULL      int r,c     forc0 clttotFeatureVectors c              forr0 rltNUMPOINTBASEDFEATURES r                      fprintffp,lft,Fr,c                  fprintffp,n       fclosefp codepre  pSo far, so good. But after this, when I declare a gmmdiag variable and try to fit a GMM to F using its learn method, the program displays a warning gmmdiaglearn no existing means and quits, thus failing to learn the GMM here the VARIANCEFLOORINGFACTOR  0.001p  precodegmmdiag writerModel bool result  writerModel.learnF, 20, mahadist, randomsubset, 100, 100, VARIANCEFLOORINGFACTOR, true writerModel.dcovs.printcovariancesn writerModel.hefts.printweightsn writerModel.means.printmeansn ifresulttrue      printfnModel learnt  else ifresultfalse      printfnModel not learnt  codepre  pI opened up the learn method on my IDE and from what I could make out,  this error warning message is displayed only when the initial seeding mode is keepexisting.

Negative 118 pThe menu of the following website a hrefhttpswww.thedegreetracker.com relnofollowhttpswww.thedegreetracker.coma has the following issue.  The menu seems to be wider than the rest of the page.  This is causing a horizontal scroll bar appear at the bottom of my browsers window.  When one scrolls over or maximizes the browser page on a very wide computer screen, it causes other parts of the page, such as the banner and the footer, to disappear when you scroll over.p  pBy way of contrast, the following page does not have the same problem  a hrefhttpswww.thedegreetracker.comaboutus relnofollowhttpswww.thedegreetracker.comaboutusa.  This second page is how I want the first one to work in terms of the banner and footer resizing correctly, and no horizontal scroll.  p  pAs far as I can tell, the HTML and CSS code between the two pages is nearly identical.  The differences I have found dont seem to make a difference.  I have spent hours trying to figure out what is causing this issue and I am now asking for fresh eyes.  Im using Bootstrap 3 and Laravel, for what its worth.  p  pIm hoping this is an easy fix that Im just missing.  Youll probably have more luck using Chrome Dev Tools on the actual web pages to figure this one out, but below is the HTML for both pages.

Negative 118 pI was evaluating Odoo v9.0 by pulling odoo v9.0 branch in my system and found that it is having some problem in showing the images. It prompts up with an error Could not display the selected Image. If you open the product form view or company form view it comes up with the error. Even if you try to save new image to a product, after saving the image again it comes with the same error and image is not displayed. p  pThe same issue is with the odoo ecommerce website, where no images are seen. I tried to debug where I can see that binary value is found, but somehow not been displayed on the screen.p  pDoes it require any configuration Does anybody knows the reason for thisp
