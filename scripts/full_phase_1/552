Positive 552 pTLDR  what are the options nowadays to run a VS2015 solution on Linuxp  hr  pI have a .NET application that runs fine in Windows and have received requests to port it to Linux. I have been trying very hard to understand what it meant today in 2015 but I am really confused with all the old posts pointing to Mono and the new posts talking about vNext and still mention Mono. Also I have an okay background with .NET but I dont know a lot about Linux in general...p  pI followed a recent tutorial and managed to compile and run a Hello World console app in Linux. That required some installation of stuff I dont know, including Mono, and then running some k commands kpm restore, kpm build, k run. However now I dont know how to move on to my realworld case scenario.p  pI have a VS2015 solution which has a lot of projects but only 4 are worth mentioning here   CommonStuff   ServiceCore   ServiceWindows  ServiceConsolep  pAll the code is in the ServiceCore project class library, which itself has a reference to CommonStuff another class library. ServiceWindows is a Windows Service project that simply calls the Main function of ServiceCore, and ServiceConsole does the same thing but in a console app for debugging reasons, since its not possible to debug a Windows Service project from Visual Studio.p  pBoth CommonStuff and ServiceCore include a lot of .NET libraries as well as some 3rd party dlls. No Windows specific code however, no pinvoke or funky stuff.p  pIf we consider ServiceConsole to become the app I want to run on Linux  what do I need to do to make it happen Compiling Hello World was one thing but now, with all thoese references... I dont know where to start. Also, I cant even have the code to be compiled in Linux proprietary code so I need the code to be compiled in Windows and the compiled dllexe to be run directly in Linux  is that something that is possible I have seen a few posts saying that Mono can run compiled applications, but each and every Mono turorial I have seen starts with compiling. Also Im not sure what this vNext is. I read stuff about the ability to run code in Linux if its targetted for .net 6... but I have no idea how or what it means.p  pI would greatly appreciate if somebody could take some time to explain in some details what the options are nowadays and if its realistic for a professional application or if its only good for Hello Worlds yet.p  pThanksp  pEDIT Ok so it seems I can compile my code in VS and somehow run it on Linux using Mono  howp
Positive 552 pFor a geospatial Xamarinproject I need SQLiteRTreeenabled.p  pWith Mono.Data.SQLite it works for Xamarin.iOS, but not for Xamarin.Android exception unknown module rtree. Seems like  Mono.Data.SQLite is just a wrapper into the sqlitelib of the OS and Android doesnt have rtree enabled but iOS has.p  pSo I thought, why not compile my own version of the Mono.Data.SQLite with RTreeenabled  So I tried a hrefhttpssystem.data.sqlite.orgindex.htmldoctrunkwwwbuild.wikimono relnofollowsystem.data.sqlitea, but this is again only creating a wrapper with no chance to enable RTree.p  pThis is unfortunately beyond my skills, but should it not be possible to compile a dll for mono from system.data.sqlitesources which is not just a wrapper, but also contains the sqlite.dll stuff with rtreeenabled  p

Positive 552 pCurrently Im trying to record system lockunlock events on linux, under mono c. I was hoping to achieve this with the help of codedbuscode, using different components on different desktop environments. And I was able to do so on Ubuntu with Unity, using codeNdesk.DBuscode api, but it seems that theres no such signals on Xfce desktop. Ive checked codedbusmonitor typesignalcode there and it shows completely nothing useful on lockunlock. So, is there any crossdesktop way to record system events I also need loginlogout and active window changep
Positive 552 pI am using EventSource to log events in my library. That library is cross platform meaning it could be used by linuxmac users. I know how EventSource works on windows.

Where are the events logged by EventSource by default on linuxmac Are there any tools available to view themp  pPlease let me know if more details are needed.p
Positive 552 pIm reading data from a serial port in Unity3D 4.5 C, MonoDevelop.

This has worked perfectly but now I need to talk to eight different serial ports simultaneously and threading has become a must.p  pI cant tell exactly where the error is coming from, but whenever I attempt to connect to a serial port from either a separate Thread or BackgroundWorker, it is unable to open the port  Open returns false. Strangely enough, the port seems to opening and will remain open ... if I attempt to open the port again from a knownworking program, it will report that the port is already open. However, inside of my program, the port is definitely not open. Open returns false and if I attempt to write to the port, I get the port not open exception.p  pIf I use Open from the main thread and dispose of it properly, it opens and closes exactly as expected. Can this wrapper be used in a separate thread, or do I need to approach this differentlyp  pEDIT I dug around a bit and found that in ConfigureSerialPort, the linep  precodeif GetCommStatehandle, ref serialConfig codepre  pis evaluating false, so the method returns false and the serial port cannot be configured.

Positive 552 pI was tasked with rewriting a part of a large .NET solution. As a part of a major overhaul, I need to identify and recode classes, responsible for some specific related functionality. My boss wants to improve architecture [by applying a particular design pattern and replacing some of homemade classes with a wellknown library]. There is no documentation of any kind, however, except for comments in the code. I generated docs with doxygen. It makes things a little simpler. Yet, it still leaves me with a task of figuring out how everything works.p  pI am looking for a tool that would help me to visualizedocument my code execution graph. If there is a portable tool, which works on OSX, even better. Any advicep  pThank youp

Positive 552 pI need to run my Cbased code on a server with Linux. I am using Visual Studio on my pc, but now I should switch to Mono on that server.  I have tried to test my code by running a single job with Mono. But there is a strange problem. When I run my code by directly using Visual Studio on my pc, everything is working well. Surprisingly, when I try the same thing on Linux, an OutOfMemoryException happens when the code is in a line to generate an array. The size of this array is 6,156  24,624, which is totally fine I have arrays with similar size earlier in my code, and there is no OutOfMemoryException for them. p  pI would be grateful if anyone can help me to understand what is the main reason for this issue and how can I handle itp
Positive 552 pI recently had a a hrefhttpsuperuser.comquestions979504loaddialogdiskaccessslowdownonwindows10huge struggle with a disk IO timeout buga, which eventually came down to the fact that codeSystem.IO.Directories.GetLogicalDrivescode and codeSystem.Environment.GetLogicalDrivescode were returning drive codeAcode, which did not actually exist.  I understand to an extent that floppy controllers are not actually smart enough to know that physical media is not connected, so that gets a pass in my book.  p  pHowever, Im still getting a ghostly drive codeHcode that does not actually exist.  Currently my solution is to pass all the drives returned by codeGetLogicalDrivescode to codeDirectory.Existscode to check them before actually accessing them, but this seems a bit hacky.  p  pI unfortunately cant use codeDriveInfocode as this is actually within Unity, and Mono for some unknowable reason did not implement codeDriveInfocode on the Windows platform in the version that Im bound to.p  pSo my question is twofoldp  ol lipDoes anyone have an explanation why Windows would return nonexistent drives in a function that is pretty obviously requesting drives that existpli lipAre there any options besides checking the path or using codeDriveInfocode to test if a drive actually existspli ol

Positive 552 pdo you recommend the Mono for high performance Unixbased TCP socket server with thousands of concurrent connections p  pWe are investigating the Mono platform for our Unixbased master server TCP socket server which should be able to handle at least 10005000 persistent connections. It must run on Unix platform because our tech infrastucture is already built on this ecosystem and ready to use. Another big benefit is that our game client is build in Unity, so using the same technology for client and server looks very prospective for us. p  pI already found and tried a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles83102CSocketAsyncEventArgsHighPerformanceSocketCod relnofollowhigh performance implementation using SocketAsyncEventArgsa on Ubuntu and the results are pretty cool. It was able to process 4000 messages per second with 1000 opened connections. There is also a hrefhttpsgithub.comkerryjiangSuperSocket relnofollowSocketServer frameworka which looks quiet interesting. p  pHowever, I am little bit sceptical about other possible drawbacksp  ol liNot sure if the Mono implementation of the SocketAsyncEventArgs is fully replacable to .NET implementation on Windows. Is it ready for production in the current state li liNot sure if this is still issue with last versions but I found many hate comments targeting Mono performance. Is Mono comparable to other highlevel languages like JavaC.NET in the question of performance li liYou know it looks like there is not many people which are going this server way with Mono. Also we want to focus primarily on business logic rather then polish and hack core server functionality. So, is it possible to rapidly prototype relatively stable framework around Mono or we will need to solve many hidden secrets and issues li liLooks like the future of Mono is in crossplatform mobile market not servers. we are looking forward to next few years li liThere is also competition which have also its pros and cons e.g. JavaNetty, Node.js and is better in some aspects. li ol

I want to minimize 3 AM calls. p  pWe are currently running one server with ZFS on Solaris and we are looking at AVS for the HA part, but we have had minor issues with Solaris CIFS implementation doesnt work with Vista, etc that have held us up. p  pWe have started looking at p  ul liDRDB over GFS GFS for distributed lock capabilityli liGluster needs     client pieces, no native CIFS     supportli liWindows DFS doc says only     replicates after file closesli ul  pWe are looking for a black box that serves up data.p  pWe currently snapshot the data in ZFS and send the snapshot over the net to a remote datacenter for offsite backup.p  pOur original plan was to have a 2nd machine and rsync every 10  15 min. The issue on a failure would be that ongoing production processes would lose 15 minutes of data and be left in the middle. They would almost be easier to start from the beginning than to figure out where to pickup in the middle. That is what drove us to look at HA solutions.p
Negative 552 pWere reviewing one of the companys systems exception handling and found a couple of interesting things.p  pMost of the code blocks if not all of them are inside a trycatch block, and inside the catch block a new BaseApplicationException is being thrown  which seems to be coming from the Enterprise Libraries.  Im in a bit of a trouble here as I dont see the benefits off doing this. throwing another exception anytime one occurs One of the developers whos been using the system for a while said its because that classs in charge of publishing the exception sending emails and stuff like that but he wasnt too sure about it.  After spending some time going through the code Im quite confident to say, thats all it does is collecting information about the environment and than publishing it.p  pMy question is   Is it reasonable to wrap all the code inside try   catch   blocks and than throw a new exception And if it is, why Whats the benefitp  pMy personal opinion is that it would be much easier to use an HttpModule, sign up for the Error event of the Application event, and do whats necessary inside the module. If wed go down this road, would we miss something Any drawbacksp  pYour opinions much appreciated.p
Negative 552 pI have a very large C project with many separate C files and headers and many dozens of contributors.  Many contributors do not have a strong knowledge of makefiles and dependencies, resulting in the not uncommon problem where you almost always have to make clean before you can trust make to have produced correct output.p  pIf make took minutes, this wouldnt be an issue, but its nearly 2 hours on a fast machine now, and people are starting to check in code that works when they make, but they dont clean first and their code ultimately breaks the build.

Negative 552 pObjectoriented design OOD combines data and its methods. This, as far as I can see, achieves two great things it provides encapsulation so I dont care what data there is, only how I get values I want and semantics it relates the data together with names, and its methods consistently use the data as originally intended.p  pSo where does OODs strength lie In constrast, functional programming attributes the richness to the verbs rather than the nouns, and so both encapsulation and semantics are provided by the methods rather than the data structures. p  pI work with a system that is on the functional end of the spectrum, and continually long for the semantics and encapsulation of OO. But I can see that OOs encapsulation can be a barrier to flexible extension of an object.

I use inheritance to add consistency and DRY principles. What happens which is not erroneous, in fact totally expected, is that the name field is listed last in the viewhtml but Id like the name field to be on top of summary and description. I do realize that I could easily fix it by copying summary and description into createform and loose the inheritance but Id like to know if this is possible. p  pstrongWhystrong Imagine youve got 100 fields in editform and have to add 10 fields on the top in createform  copying and maintaining the two forms wouldnt look so sexy then.

The .field attribute is a SortedDict one of Djangos internal datastructures which doesnt provide any way to reorder keyvalue pairs. It does however provide a way to insert items at a given index but that would move the items from the class members and into the constructor. This method would work, but make the code less readable. The only other way I see fit is to modify the framework itself which is lessthanoptimal in most situations.p  pIn short the code would become something like thisp  precodeclass editformforms.Form     summary  forms.CharField     description  forms.CharFieldwidgetforms.TextArea   class createformeditform     def initself,args,kwargs         forms.Form.initself,args,kwargs          self.fields.insert0,name,forms.CharField codepre  pThat shut me up  p

Negative 552 pIve got an ASP.NET web app which is trying to execute the CreateRepository method within SharpSvn so that new repos can be provisioned through a web interface. Everything runs fine when executing the app from within Visual Studio as its running under my own identity which has rights to the VisualSVN server instance running on my local machine. However, if I run the app under IIS on my local XP machine then the asp.net worker process executes under the local aspnet account which I cant seem to grant the rights to create repositories.

Negative 552 pI have an iPhone localization problem that has me perplexed. I was localizing my app and had English as well as simplified and traditional Chinese working fine. I have two files, Localizable.strings and sounds.plist which have been localized. Strings in both files appeared correctly on the device and emulator.p  pNow yesterday I am adding Spanish, Italian and German. When I test in the emulator, everything displays correctly. But when I deploy to the device, the strings contained in Localizable.strings display correctly, but the strings contained in sounds.plist always display in English. Even the Chinese strings stopped appearing correctly.p  pIve tried cleaning the builds, copying the translated text back into the sounds.plist files, and even nuking the files, deleting the lproj folders, removing the localizations and starting over.p  pI set a breakpoint in XCode and it seems like for this file, it is not detecting the loc folder.

Negative 552 pHow to fire up event from a separate C programp  pThe C program I am working on has two separate components Task Creator TC and Task Processor TP. TC is attached to a web service that constantly inserts new tasks into a database table. On the other hand TP reads from the same table and processes each tasks then updates the status back to the same table. Its almost like a queue but done using database rather than e.g. MSMQ. Every 5 seconds TP wakes up and reads from the table to check for unprocessed tasks however this has some performance impacts. When theres no new tasks its a bit of waste to fire up a select from where SQL statement. The ideal way is to have some kind of notification method that when new tasks are inserted TP will get notified and then wakes up from its dream to check for new tasks. p  pstrongCurrent solutionstrongp  pimg srchttpyuml.me3b49bcfd altdiagram of current solution p  pstrongIdeal solutionstrongp  pimg srchttpyuml.me5cf843a5 altdiagram of idealsolution p

Negative 552 pI am trying to host my site that uses DotNetOpenAuth OpenID behind ISA 2006 reverse proxy, and after it authenticated with a provider such as Google, and it returns with a URL with 253A in the URL. However,  ISA HTTP filter rejects the request.p  pWhat I need to do is, on ISA web publishing rule, right click  config HTTP policy properties  uncheck Verify Normalization  and it worked.p  ul liIs this a problem on ISA 2006 generally Are other firewalls having similar problemsli liOr, is it an OpenID or DotNetOpenAuth issue li liIs it safe to disable Normalization checking on ISAli ul  pAccording to MSDN, quote Web servers receive requests that are URL encoded. This means that certain characters may be replaced with a percent sign  followed by a particular number. For example, 20 corresponds to a space, so a request for a hrefhttpmyserverMy20DirMy20File.htm relnofollowhttpmyserverMy20DirMy20File.htma is the same as a request for a hrefhttpmyserverMy relnofollowhttpmyserverMya DirMy File.htm. Normalization is the process of decoding URLencoded requests.  Because the  can be URL encoded, an attacker can submit a carefully crafted request to a server that is basically doubleencoded. If this occurs, Internet Information Services IIS may accept a request that it would otherwise reject as not valid. When you select Verify Normalization, the HTTP filter normalizes the URL two times. If the URL after the first normalization is different from the URL after the second normalization, the filter rejects the request. This prevents attacks that rely on doubleencoded requests. Note that while we recommend that you use the Verify Normalization function, it may also block legitimate requests that contain a .p

Negative 552 pI have a fact table containing 8 Million rows with 1 Million rows increase per month. The table already contains indexes on it. The table is used by IBM Cognos environment to generate reports.

Only one partition is affected per query. Can someone explain how to optimize this p  pSecond idea I came to is to implement the fact table as Index organized table, but it will have to have all the columns as primary key.

Negative 552 pIm attempting to replicate on android an iphone app my company had developed externally. p  pMy need is simple but it seems hard to achieve under android. I have three numeric edittext inputs. Each should take only decimal numeric values. So numbers 09 and . or ,. On the iphone this was achieved by a slide in calculator style keypad with one of the buttons a GO button that when pressed hides the keypad and, if all the inputs have valid values triggers a calculation that displays values on the screen. p  pIve tried the android phone input type and this is very close to what I want but I have no idea how to replicate the go button.

Negative 552 pHello there fellow developers I am working on a Windows Phone 7 app and I cant figure out what I believe is a simple problem for the more seasoned ones. Say I have a layout consisting of two elements a ListBox filled with an abundance of items and a TextBlock providing the user with some basic instructions.p  pI want these to be one above the other when the device is in Portrait orientation and I want these to be next to each other when the device orientation changes to Landscape.p  pFor the Portrait orientation I am using a Grid layout manager, as it lets me define the rows heights like so... row 0 codeHeight2code, row 1 codeHeightcodep  pListbox sits in row 0, TextBlock in row 1. Now, what would be really neat is to simple change the codeRowDefinitioncodes into codeColumnDefinitioncodes and reassign the listboxtextblock to the grids columns instead of rows for when the device switches into Landscape.p  pBut thats just my idea. I dont know how to get this done elegantly. Maybe theres a better approach to this Or maybe this is the correct approach and there is some method built for exactly this purposep  pThank you for your suggestionsp

Negative 552 pIm trying to view some 3d geometry in a custom ipad application Im writing.

However it seems that the template specialisation errors are occurring because you arent allowed to specialise an inner class if you dont specialise the outer class. I can work around this, but it means Im relying on the compiler optimising out certain things.

Negative 552 pI just got my worst maintenance nightmare  a silent error.p  pI was calling a procedure using Odp.Net inside a custom package, and the procedure call failed silently without any exception being thrown verified using both step by step debug and a catch all clause. After much searching I noticed that the Package was invalidated some mishap on the server, after recompiling the package everything was back to normal the call code was correct and unmodified.p  pSince it is really easy to invalidate a package accidentally in Oracle, I need to catch this kind of error, if only to log them for debugging.p  pWith MSs System.Data.OracleClient an OracleException was thrown in this case, is there any way to get a similar behavior with Oracles Oracle.DataAccess  Some kind of sqlnet.ora parameter  I found no similar problem anywhere on the net.p  pusing Oracle11R2 server, latest Oracle Win32 client. .Net3.5.p

Negative 552 pIm writing a kernel module that checks to see if the time is between two specified hours, and disables input if it is. This has to do with me wanting to make sure I go to bed early. I know I could also use any number of different techniques including cron etc, but I wanted to learn kernel programming...p  pAs a first version, I therefore check if the current hour is between start and end, which are set via parameters to the module.p  pMy question is therefore  How do I get the current hour I have no access to the usual time functions in the standard library because I am in kernel space. Im guessing that I should be using dogettimeofday for this, but that only gives me seconds and nanoseconds, and I need hours in the current day.p  pThanks.p

Negative 552 pIm sure this has a simple answer Im just not seeing the bane with APIs like Cocoa that are enormous...  Im working with a version of Apples Sketch sample I think it was the original, before they added the Accessibility stuff and made the entire thing based on KVO.  Im working with the kiss version that is floating around out there that adds Bezier and polygon tools, trying to get it so the Bezier point tracking loop will toss end the path if you click on the tool palette while creating it.  The relevant lines for working with the point in the tracking list are suchp  precode SKTGraphicView view  Tracking loop while 1      event  [[view window] nextEventMatchingMask NSLeftMouseDownMask  NSLeftMouseDraggedMask  NSLeftMouseUpMask]     point  [view convertPoint[event locationInWindow] fromViewnil] codepre  pHow do I tell if this point is inside the documents window or not  I triedp  precodeBOOL insideView  [view mousepoint inRect[view bounds]] codepre  pwhich works as long as its tracking MouseDragged events, but fails if I click in the tool palette window.  From the coordinates that come out of locationInWindow, it looks like if I click in a separate window, it spits out the points relative to the origin of the enclosing window  whatever that window is.  How do I get it to convert from whatever screen coordinates are [event locationOnScreen] and then convert onto a specific views coordinate systemp  pI can use [view window]  [event window]  but this doesnt seem to change for MouseDragged events where the initial click was inside the window but I can check against a bounding rectangle there.  But it seems like if nextEventMatchingMask is called on a particular NSWindow object, it should only return events that happen to be in that window.p
Negative 552 pIve just added a weak event implementation to a project using a hrefhttpdiditwith.netPermaLink,guid,aacdb8ae7baa4423a953c18c1c7940ab.aspxDustin Campbells WeakEvent classa.

It seems to work well so far, but in an effort to understand the code I came across the followingp  precodepublic class WeakEventHandlerltT, Egt  IWeakEventHandlerltEgt     where T  class     where E  EventArgs      private delegate void OpenEventHandlerT this, object sender, E e     ... codepre  pIm used to declaring delegates types with just the codeobject sendercode and codeEventArgs argscode arguments, so what does the codeT thiscode part achieve Obviously it is declaring something of  codeWeakEventHandlercodes codeTcode generic type but Ive never seen codethiscode before and googling it is understandably hopeless.p

Negative 552 pFirst of all, strongthis is not a question aboutstrong emhow to get the users IP addressem, as i know how to do that.p  pBasically, administrators of my website ASP.NET MVC 3 Web Application need the ability to block a certain IP address from submitting user content. So im storing the IP Address against user in our system. Cool.p  pMy question isp  blockquote   pWhen e.g at what times, page lifecycle events should i be checked the users current IP address and saving to the databasep blockquote  pAt the moment, im thinking of using strongsessionstrong. That is, when i first create the session e.g codeSessionOnStartcode, grab the users IP address and stick it in the session. Then when the session ends e.g codeSessionOnEndcode, i see if the IP address in session is different to that of the database. If it is, update the DB. p  pAt the moment were using strongInProcstrong, but theres a good chance well go to strongStateServerstrong later on  and MSDN states strongSessionOnEndstrong is only available to strongInProcstrong. So that might be a problem.p  pAny thoughtsalternatives to this approachp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo i tried using codeSessionOnStartcode to try and do the following thingp  blockquote   pIf user is authenticated, get their IP address, get their last IP from the database, and if they different, update the database.p blockquote  pBut the problem seems to be that codeSessionOnStartcode runs strongbeforestrong codeApplicationAuthenticateRequestcode  so its never passing the is authenticated check.p  pA good example is if a user logs into my website  using Forms Auth, which sets a cookie with an expiration date of a week for example.p  pThen they come back a few days later  the codeSessionOnStartcode is fired  but theyre not authenticated yet. Even though the cookie is present  it hasnt been processed into the http context yet.p  pSo the SessionOnStart looks like a no go  any other ideasp

Negative 552 pThere are two problems I run into occasionally. One is compile time assertions and the other is a header file being included in multiple places in weird ways this is not my code so I cannot emfixem it by not including it in weird ways. Even if I tried, it would take too many hoursdays as it is deeply embedded, e.g.p  precodeclass Foo  public include VariableDeclarations.h  Some file that has all the variables that need to be declared                                         which is also included by several other classes in the same way  codepre  pThe above code is a simplication of what I am currently dealing with. Of course, the class Foo is doing other things as well. p  pNow if I add another variable declaration to the header in this case, and the file codeClass Foocode is in does not know about the type, I will get a compile error. To fix it, I include the necessary headers. Problem is, all the compiler tells me is strongundeclared identifierstrong and the file name comes up as codeVariableDeclarations.hcode. I would like to know which file included the declarations and consequently did not know about the type that I just added. p  pSimilar thing happens with compile time assertions. I have no indication as to which linefile caused the error. It just gives me the error e.g. in Eigen math library, I was experiencing this a lot.p

Negative 552 pBeing a python programmer for four years now it doesnt mean much though and moving to ObjectiveC the one concept that is weird and alien to me is memory management. Luckily garbage collectiom exists and I only intend to develop apps for the mac OS 10.6, so in all my projects so far I have always turned garbage collection to required. But here is my problem when I use Instruments with the Alloc and Leaks tool I see leaked bytes poppin in the graph.  Very weird. What does Garbage Collection really do, when it is required. The way I see it is that you can completely forget about retain, release, etc. But is that true Please provide examples where GC will help and where it wont if any, so that I can understand what I am doing wrong.p  h2Edith2  pI probably should have been more clear. The problem I want to solve is the fact that, even after GC is set up as required, Instruments still finds leaks. I also asked what GC does just so I could make sure that it does what I think, and the problem is not in my code or in GC, but elsewhere. That elsewhere is what I want to find out.p

Negative 552 pIm running into a problem while running both a Flash socket and using Ajax to load pages. Both work fine separately. I am able to browse my site using the Ajax calls, or I am able to sendreceive messages through the socket.p  pHowever, when the socket is connected for some reason the Ajax calls start to seemingly be put into a queue and never actually finish until I stop the socket. If I disconnect from the socket, or close the socket on the server side, then the Ajax call immediately finishes and loads the page. The Ajax call never times out, it just waits forever, right up until I close the socket connection.p  pIn JavaScript, Im using jQuerys code.getJSONcode function to load the pages which I thought were asynchronous calls.p  pIn Flash Im using the basic ActionScript 3 Socket classp  precodethis.socket  new Socket this.socket.addEventListenerEvent.CONNECT, onConnectHandler this.socket.addEventListenerEvent.CLOSE, onCloseHandler this.socket.addEventListenerIOErrorEvent.IOERROR, onIOErrorHandler this.socket.addEventListenerProgressEvent.SOCKETDATA, onDataHandler this.socket.addEventListenerSecurityErrorEvent.SECURITYERROR, onSecurityErrorHandler codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve verified that strongemnoemstrong HTTP request is being made. It is in fact being queued by the browser for some reason. I also noticed that not only will it queue the Ajax requests, but it also will queue a browser refresh. If I hit the refresh button it hangs forever as well.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pActually, I was checking port 80 when I should have been checking port 443. There is actually a request being made to the server, its just hanging for some reason. This leads me to believe that theres an issue with the socket which is using PHP somehow making the PHP processor queue the requests, or maybe Apache is queuing the requests since it sees PHP is being used by the socket. Im still not sure why the additional requests to the PHP processor are not being fulfilled until the socket is closed, but Im pretty sure it has something to do with the fact that the PHP socket is in an alwaysopen state and blocking the other requests.p

Negative 552 pAfter reading up on c0xs atomics and in combination with non locking queues I decided to have a go at playing with them. p  pThe idea was to write a single producer, multiple consumer queue with optimistic locking. The messages do not need to be consumed. Skipping is perfectly fine as long as that if a consumer reads it reads the last version or knows that its read was bad.p  pIn the code below the strategy I had in mind fails. The data gets corrupted because data is written outoforder. Any pointers on why this is, and how to fix it would be greatly appreciated.p  pCompilation on Linux g stdc0x o code code.cpp lpthreadp  pThanks, Dennisp  precode  This features 2 threads in which the first writes to a structure  and the second tries to read from that with an optimistic  locking strategy. The data is equal to the versioning so we can   see if the data is corrupt or not.   since 20111028  author Dennis Fleurbaaij ltmaildennisfleurbaaij.comgt   include ltpthread.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include ltstdatomic.hgt include ltsched.hgt include ltassert.hgt include ltiostreamgt include ltxmmintrin.hgt  struct structuret      stdatomicltunsigned intgt id     unsigned int dataa     unsigned int datab      char pad[ 64  12 ]   define NUMSTRUCTURES 2 struct structuret structures[NUMSTRUCTURES]  stdatomicltsizetgt currentversionindex  volatile bool start  false volatile bool run  true sizet const itercount  10000000     Write thread   void writervoid      whilestart         schedyield      sizet i     for i0  iltitercount  i               sizet index  currentversionindex.loadstdmemoryorderrelaxed         sizet nextindex   currentversionindex  1  amp NUMSTRUCTURES1          structures[nextindex].dataa  i         structures[nextindex].datab  i          structures[nextindex].id.storei, stdmemoryorderrelease          currentversionindex.storenextindex          stdcout ltlt Queued  id  ltlt i ltlt , index  ltlt nextindex ltlt stdendl         sleep1           runfalse      Read thread   void readervoid      whilestart         schedyield      unsigned int previd0      sizet i     whilerun              sizet index  currentversionindex.loadstdmemoryorderrelaxed         unsigned int id  structures[index].id.loadstdmemoryorderacquire          if id gt previd                       unsigned int dataa  structures[index].dataa             unsigned int datab  structures[index].datab               Reread the data and check optimistic lock.

Negative 552 pOk, Ive been searching for a while and just cant seem to find the answer, so Im hoping someone can point me straight here...p  pI have gVim 7.3 for windows installed and am trying to run it from the powershell prompt v2.0Win 7amd64.  Vim starts fine, but the colors are all jacked.  Normally I use the desert theme for gVim.  For POSIX shells I usually use CSApprox.vim plugin to get the gVim colors in vim and it works great all i have set in the .vimrc is the set tCo256 for it.  Anyway, Ive tried vim with and with out the 256 and CSApprox plugin, but still get the wrong colors when launched from powershell and cmd, but lets stick with powershell for simplicity here.  How can I get powershell vim to look like gVim desert without permanately changing the powershell colors outside of Vimp

Negative 552 pLately I have been watching Pluralsight intro videos on MVC 3. I have never worked with the Model View Control approach before, but Im starting to understand how these 3 crucial parts of an app are separated.p  pI created a frontend prototype of a survey I would like to implement into a View of my MVC web app. The survey is in HTML, CSS, using jQuery to deliver content changes depending on the type of evaluation 611 questions, and jQuery UI for a couple slider ratings.p  pI noticed through tutorials that you can use an HTML form and helpers that allow the user to edit content, but my prototype already allows the users to rate via radio buttons, comment text boxes, and sliders. Would I need to change any of my existing code if I just want to store this employee data to the Model, and depending on what surveys the employee has completed through the Controller, disable drop down fieldsp  pAlso, would I store the current employee data on submit of survey through an HttpPost in the Controller to the Modelp  pMy apologies if my questions seem rather vague. Could someone point me in the right direction to a resource or documentation similar to my needs above The Pluralsight videos are taking me in the wrong direction.p

Negative 552 pTeaching myself Java by coding a MIDI handling program.  One thing the program needs to be able to do is convert back and forth between MIDI note numbers and their corresponding compact string representations.

Negative 552 pNot sure how relevant this is for stackoverflow but here goes... Over a year ago friend of mine said she was interested in learning Web Development  Programming and asked me to assist in her learning. I explained some concepts, give an overview of my experience and I have taught her HTML, OO JavaScript and CSS. Now shes confident with those she said she would like to start using more powerful toolslanguages and I suggested using ASP.NET with C. I discussed my dislike of WebForms I hated Webforms so much I jumped from using ASPASP.NET to PHP and ROR for a few years however as soon as ASP.NET MVC was released I jumped back on board and I now use that as my default technology. I suggested that she disregards Webforms and just learns MVC using C, when giving her resources Books, Videos, etc I noticed that most of these assume that the developer is familiar with WebForms or the resources devote 90 of their content to Webforms and 10 to MVC p  pIm now unsure if Ive given the correct advise and perhaps made her learning harder due to most resources focus on or assume knowledge of Webforms. Has anyone got an opinion or experience of learning MVC with or without WebForms knowledge. If you were successful in learning ASP.NET MVC without Webforms knowledge please give advice on how you achieved this resources, books, sites, etc.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 552 pI am confused about where I put a dependency property when building a WPF application using the MVVM pattern.  Does it go in the Model or the ViewModelp  h2Edith2  pAfter looking at early answers thanks for those, I find that I am still confused, so I am giving more detail to help someone explain this to me.p  pI have a class called Station.  It is used by surveyors and civil engineers to represent the length along a road.  For the most part, a Station is just a double, but it has a few decorations.  First off, the format is different.  When distance along is greater than 100 feet, we add a  symbol as another way to format it.  So 1234.56 feet down the road we might have Station 1234.56.  I will skip the other decorations since this one is good enough for my point.p  pThus the logic for the special formatting lives in Station, a class in the Model.  I want a TextBox in the View to take user input of 1234.56 and coerce it to a text value of 1234.56.  So I want a TextBox to give the user access to a value in the Model, so it needs to be a dependency property.  That is correct, isnt it  But the business logic for coercingparsingunderstanding how to go back and forth between a TextBox and a Station should live in the Station class.  Rightp  pFurthermore, I will later want to give the user the ability to set the station value by clicking on a graphical drawing of the road, including dynamically updating the value as the mouse moves and locking the value in upon issuing a data point.  Now you see why I tried to keep this brief.p  pSo is this not something that I would want to make a dependency property, especially with the dynamic data point possibly getting involved later  If not, how do I hook a text box item to a station using MVVM  I really have researched this a lot before asking my question, but with no success.p  ul liPaulli ul

The problem is that uWSGI is using the default python binary in usrbin.p  pOne solution is to use a separate uWSGI installed using pip in the API users environment, but I really want to use the systems uWSGI because it integrates better with the OS.p  pIs there any way to specify which Python binary uWSGI should use, other then by installing a separate one If I have to install a separate instance of uWSGI, what is the best way to have it start on system bootp  pEdit just realised that it is probably not using the python binary, but just lining against its library, so there is no way for me to use the default installation of wsgi, and the nondefault python. But the question still remains, what is the best way to integrate a custom built uWSGI into the system.p

Negative 552 pI have a job where I get a lot of separate tasks through. For each task I need to download some data, process it and then upload it again.p  pIm using a multiprocessing pool for the processing.p  pI have a couple of issues Im unsure of though.p  pFirstly the data can be up to 20MB roughly, I ideally want to get it to the child worker process without physically moving it in memory and getting the resulting data back to the parent process as well without moving it. As Im not sure how some tools are working under the hood I dont know if I can just pass the data as an argument to the pools codeapplyasynccode from my understanding it serialises the objects and then theyre created again once the reach the subprocess, or if I should use a multiprocessing codeQueuecode or codemmapcode maybe or something elsep  pI looked at a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarymultiprocessing.htmlsharedctypesobjects relnofollowctypes objectsa but from what I understand only the objects that are defined when the pool is created when the process forks can be shared Which is no good for me as Ill continuously have new data coming in which I need to share.p  pOne thing I shouldnt need to worry about is any concurrent access on the data so I shouldnt need any type of locking. This is because the processing will only start after the data has been downloaded, and the upload will also only start after the output data has been generated.p  pAnother issue Im having is that sometimes the tasks coming in might spike and as a result Im downloading data for the tasks quicker than the child processes can process it. So therefore Im downloading data quicker than I can finish the tasks and dispose of the data and python is dying from running out of memory. What would be a good way to hold up the tasks at the downloading stage when memory is almost full  too much data is in the job pipeline I was thinking of some type of ref count by using the number of data bytes so I can limit the amount of data between download and upload and only download when the number is below some threshold. Although Id be worried a child might sometimes fail and Id never get to take the data it had off of the count. Is there a good way to achieve this kind of thingp

Negative 552 pBefore trying to build something, I would like to determine if it is possible.p  pStart with a text area which can be prepopulated with text and which the user can adddelete text.  Now, There are some small elements to the side.  They can either be images or HTML elements such as a button or anchor links, whatever is easier.  The user can drag an elements into the text area, and it will be inserted at the mouse cursor location and take up text space by pushing the existing text around it the nearby element will also remain so the user can drop a second.  The elements will remain as an element which can later be dragged elsewhere in the document or outside of the view port in which it will be removed.  When the elements are positioned as desired, the location of the elements can be identified through some means regex, dom, etc so that they can be replaced with different content.p  pLine breaks will be needed.  Ideally, it will work with jQuery and IE7, however, the IE7 desire might need to be changed.p  pIve come across the following which are close but not quite.p  ul lia hrefhttpskfox.comjqExamplesinsertAtCaret.html relnofollowhttpskfox.comjqExamplesinsertAtCaret.htmlali lia hrefhttpjsbin.comegefi relnofollowhttpjsbin.comegefia reference a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1922559jquerydragdropintoatextareajQuery Drag amp Drop into a Text Areaali lia hrefhttpjqueryui.comdroppablemethodoption relnofollowhttpjqueryui.comdroppablemethodoptionali ul  pIf you think it could be built and you have suggestions where I should start, please advise.p

Negative 552 pTurns out this seems to be a complex subject, please tell me if my approach is too simple.p  pBasically what im trying to do is send an email reminder to a list of users only when they have a reminder coming up, but that is besides the point at 7 am every morning. Of course 7 am is at a different time based on the server location for everyone all over the world.p  pThe plan is to collect to GMT offset hour via javascript from the user when they registerp  precodevar today  new Date   var offset  today.getTimezoneOffset60 codepre  pSimple enough, I now know the offset hour and store that in a database along with the rest of the users data. Now server side I have a TimerTask set up that runs every hour. I collect the system hour say its 5 am, see how far away from my target time that is in this case 2 75, get the system offset hour in this case its 5, then pull all users from the database that have a GMT offset hour of 3 5  2, then do the email sending etc. At this point im assuming I know its 7 am for everyone whos time zone offset is 3 and I can continue with the process. This will run again the next hour and collect all users with a time zone offset of 4. Is this something that will actually work, or am I missing somethingp  precodeCalendar systemTime  Calendar.getInstance int targetHour  7 int currentHour  systemTime.getCalendar.HOUROFDAY Its 5 am. int difference  targetHour  currentHour 2 int zoneOffset  systemTime.getCalendar.ZONEOFFSET  10006060 5 int targetZone  zoneOffset  difference 3  ListltUsergt users  userDAO.findByZoneOffsettargetZone forUser user  users      Send email or whatever I want to do with these users.  codepre  pI understand its possible that the client time zone may be set incorrectly and therefore product an off result, but im willing to take that risk as its not absolutely necessary for the reminders to go out at exactly 7 am, just preferable.p

Negative 552 pI had some lua code with the following linep  precodeJSON  loadfileJSON.lua codepre  pThe file JSON.lua is in the same directory as the lua code that line came from.  This code worked for me for a while, and then, without my changing either the lua source, or the JSON.lua, or permission of any of the files, or the directory from where I was running the lua code, I started getting a nil error on that line.  I simply recall NO relevant changes that could have any impact on the lua code.p  pAdding an assert revealed that the error was caused by the file not being found.  Playing with file permissions, restarting my machine didnt resolve the issue, and pulling back code that I had checked in and was working perfectly did not resolve the error.p  pI resolved the error by changing the line above to provide the absolute path to that JSON.lua file.p  pIs there anything explaining why the code without the absolute path could have worked for a while and then stopped workingp  pNote This behavior of working and then not working happened to me twice over a week.

Negative 552 pI am using multiple pages that each have jQuery tabs. Lets say I have Page1.html with tab1 and tab2 and Page2.html with tab3 and tab4. My code has issues withp  p1 Within the tab content, Page1.htmltab2 has a hyperlink to Page1.htmltab1. The link does not work  the page just stays on tab1 when clicking the link. However, a hyperlink in the menu container on Page1 to tab1 does work. Both hyperlinks use the same a hreftab1 but for whatever reason, only the link outside of the Page1.htmltab2 content works when linking to Page1.htmltab1. The hyperlinks in the menu container always work.p  p2 If I send someone a hyperlink to www.Page1.htmltab2, the page URL shows as www.Page1.html with tab 1 showing, meaning I cannot link directly to a tab. However, the menu on the website does correctly link to tabs. If I click the menu link for Page2.htmltab3 while browsing Page1.html, the tab will correctly load and the URL shows Page2.htmltab3 and will remain that way even if I click tab4 on the page. The URL ONLY changes when clicking menu hyperlinks to different pages, i.e. Page1.htmltab1 to Page2.htmltab3. Clicking Page2.htmltab3 while on Page2.htmltab4, the tab content will correctly change to tab3 but the URL will remain as Page2.htmltab4.p  pstrongWhat I Wantstrong p  pA To be able to send someone a link directly to a tab. Sending someone a link to www.Page1.htmltab2 will always load as the URL www.Page1.html with the first tab displaying. However, the menu hyperlinks on the page do work.p  pB To be able to link between tabs on the same page if the link is within the tab content. For example, a link in the content of Page1.htmltab1 should be able to link to Page1.htmltab2. Right now, it only works if the link in the content of Page1.htmltab1 is linking to a tab on a separate page like Page2.htmltab3. p  pC strongemEXTRA CREDITemstrong When I click directly on a tab, the tab image pops out and the previously selected tab unpops. When I click a menu hyperlink to a tab, the previous tab remains popped out even with the correct content for the newly selected tab showing.

Negative 552 pSo i have some data stored into an object, and I need to retrieve the data and output it in a table like format. I have tried using format specifiers and due to the width of characters the information changes. I need to create something similar to a table, return that object, and then be able to print the information on a piece of paper without printing cell lines. I have tried a data table but i cant see the info in the table. what is the easiest way to do this It is a windows form application. The user is saving the information in 3 classes. using a list. I have tried using spaces and t to tab the format. But depending on the width of the character the formatting is off by a few spaces. Also the length of the data can go back and forth between 13 characters. p

Negative 552 pA normal installation of the WordPress CMS consists of hundreds of scripts, plugins and themes. The concept allows to replace scripts by simply creating a copy of it and put the altered version in the right directory.  However, a copied script will not be updated when a new version of the script or plugin is installed. Within a script there are often hundreds of functions. The cost of changing one function is that the other functions will also be no longer updated.  In many cases the Wordpress hooks and filters are sufficient to add or suppress specific functionality, but not always.p  pIm looking for a way to redeclare or overload a function so that the original script may be replaced by the CMS whenever an update is installed. I tried thisp  precoderenamefunction wpfunction , oldwpfuntion   function wpfunction          things to do before the function     a  b          call the old function     result  oldwpfunction          things to do afterwards     b  c      return result  codepre  pBut it doesnt work. Also, with Wordpress you never know what kind of and how many arguments to aspect. The overloaded function has to deal with that too. p  pMy question is how do I go about this to make it work in all cases, with any number and any type of arguments.  And without having to change anything to the original functionscript because they may and must be overwritten by Wordpress updates.p

Negative 552 pIm programming a chat between 2 computer using the serial cable, this is my first time using assembly. Ive been working so far on the interface without problems, im using NASM to compile the .asm into .com files and then run them.p  pNow I started working with the serial port and wrote this simple program to send a string character by character and check using hyperterminal if it does in fact gets sent.p  precodeorg 0x0100      mov ah, 0     mov al, 0xe3            port parameters     mov dx, 0               port numbe COM 1     int 0x14                initialize port      mov si, msg     mov cx, [length]     l  mov ah,0x1             lodsb           loads next character     int 0x14                sends character     loop l      mov ax,0x4c00     int 0x21        msg db hello world      length dw 11 codepre  pBut when i run the .com file i get this msgthe system cannot open com1 port requested by the application. I read that running it in compatibility might fix this. p  pSo, is it possible to run a .com file in compatibility mode  Will i have to  make .exe file to run in compatibility mode If so, i know that you have to generate a .obj before the .exe but nasm wont let me do a .obj of the code above, i believe the code needs a different format like a main use instead of the org0x0100 but thats not clear for me, as i have looked it up but everybody does different things.p
Negative 552 pThe question came up, when I started implementing asynchronous set and get operations on an object using the codeconcurrent.futurescode module like thisp  precodeimport time from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor  executor  ThreadPoolExecutormaxworkers2  class Fooobject     def setsomethingself         def longrunningsetter             time.sleep1.5             printSet something         return executor.submitlongrunningsetter      def getsomethingself         def longrunninggetter             time.sleep0.5             return something         return executor.submitlongrunninggetter  foo  Foo future  foo.getsomething printGot   future.result codepre  pBut now, setting a value and waiting for it becomes a little bit awkward to use and semantically incorrectp  precodefoo.setsomething.result codepre  palthough I feel its still valid, because the codeFoocode object is at the lowest level and further abstractions could be built on top of the futures.p  pSo, to sum up my problemp  ul liAre futures the right kind of abstractions to getset values asynchronously from an object Especially for setters which do not return any valueli liShould I add a codeblockingcode parameter to codesetsomethingcode in order to get rid of the coderesultcode call I have my doubts with this approach, because then Id encourage not to use futures at all.li liHow would you do itli ul
Negative 552 pRecording and replaying against a web app using Ajax seems to work after some serious correlation work  However replaying the script with the viewer turned on I observe that during some steps in the replay the pages being dislayed contains i.e. only XML on the form codeltajaxresponsgt ....

Negative 552 pIm using blobstore to serve audio files embedded in HTML5 audio element. Because I have a blobkey as a part of url I can assume that for any given url its content will never change. That looks like a perfect setup for caching.p  pYesterday I implemented a solution which seemed to work. At least I remember that it worked . Unfortunately today I discovered, that it doesnt work with Chrome and production server. It works perfectly with Internet Explorer and Firefox. It even works with Chrome and development server  I use version 1.7.6. My solution uses CacheControl headers, but it seems that only Firefox makes any use of it. Additionally I added an ETag header. When I discover IfNoneMatch request header with the same value I return 304 code. That seems to work with Internet Explorer. It also works with Chrome and development server. I remember that it had worked yesterday with Chrome and production, but Im not completely sure. Anyway the problem I have is why both caching mechanisms are ignored by Chrome. I suspect that it may have something to do with chunked encoding which is generated only for chrome, but I dont understand why caching is disabled in that casep  pAnd now a lot of details.p  h2Firefoxh2  pInitial request headersp  precodeHost eduzabawy.appspot.com UserAgent Mozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.1 WOW64 rv20.0 Gecko20100101 Firefox20.0 Accept audiowebm,audioogg,audiowav,audioq0.9,applicationoggq0.7,videoq0.6,q0.5 AcceptLanguage pl,enusq0.7,enq0.3 Range bytes0 Referer httpeduzabawy.appspot.comdziecko Cookie childrenjEDor1B8VRDRJreWmUVlUQ075075 sessioneyJfc2lkIjoiWk91QmlsOEJlTEd4QVFuYVFiYkpsTyJ9136519050881d81772f6f409dd57ad43a9f447f92d1b56d29e Connection keepalive codepre  pInitial response headersp  precodeHTTP1.1 206 Partial Content CacheControl public maxage100000000 ContentRange bytes 03724937250 ContentType audioogg Date Fri, 05 Apr 2013 194547 GMT Etag blobstore Server Google Frontend XFirefoxSpdy 3 codepre  pOn subsequent loads it seems that Firefox doesnt even try to fetch the files.

Negative 552 pWhat Im trying to achieve is the followingp  pI have multiple dependent configurations for a single, logical build.

I need to be able store this value and use it in subsequent steps. All dependent configurations for a single build should receive the same value.p  pstrongSetupstrong computes a value strongxstrong. I then have configurations strongBxstrong and strongAxstrong that run after strongSetupstrong and need to be fed the calculated value strongxstrong. p  pPreviously, Ive managed to do something similar for things that are calculated as part of the TeamCity configuration. E.g. I generated a unique build id for the entire build chain and was able to access it via dep.teamcityconfigurationid.system.build.number.p  pThis time, the value I need to propagate is calculated in the guts of a build script and not as part of the TeamCity plumbing. Ive managed to wrap the setup script in question and grep out the value I need, but I dont know how to propagate it between configurations. p  pIs this even possible, or am I barking up the wrong tree If I cannot do this in a noninsane way, is there a better alternative Im missingp  pThanksp

receive a 2D texture and are meant to scale it beautifully across a highres 2D surface the device screen.

I wish to use the exact same algorithm in an optimized way.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  ol lipI found that if I do all the texture fetches with a constant vector instead of dependent vectors I get a major performance improvement, so this is obviously a big bottleneck  probably because of the cache. However, I still need to do those fetches. I played with doing at least some of the fetches with vec2 varyings without any swizzling but it didnt improve anything. I wonder what might be a good way to efficiently poll 21 texels.pli lipI found that a major part of the calculations is being done multiple times with the exact same set of texels  because the output is scaled by at least x2, and I poll with GLNEAREST. There at least 4 fragments that fall on exactly the same texels. If the scaling is x4 on a highres device, there are 16 fragments that fall on the same texels  which is a big waste. Is there any way to perform an additional shader pass that will calculate all the values that dont change across multiple fragments I thought about rendering to an additional offscreen texture, but I need to store multiple values per texel, not just one.pli ol  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  ol liTried to simplify the boolean expressions using known boolean rules  saved me few operations but didnt have any effect on performance.li ol  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  ol liThought about a way to pass calculations to the vertex shader  just have a geometry that creates my full screen, but with a lot of vertices that correspond to each original pixel before scaling. For example, if my original texture is 320x200 and my target screen is 1280x800, there will be 320x200 vertices spread evenly. Then, do most of the calculations in those vertices.

Negative 552 pGood morning everyone, how are you  Onve again I am here sharing my questions and learning more and more with you. I hope that somehow we can exchange information and expand our knowledge.  Guys, Im using a class very interesting I found on the internet for creating Scrollers I have difficulties creating them. However, I have the need to load a swf that contains an movieclip object scroller inside. When I do this, the scroller stops working because it no longer has the object reference stage that uses MouseEvent.MOUSEWHEEL.  Could anyone give me any tips on how to use these listener without the stage reference  Regards,p

But here comes the clash something I was very sad about because everything worked very well up until nowp  pWordPress overtakes the session and kills CodeIgniters session.p  pI already tried tons of thingsp  ul licodesessionrenamePHPSESSIDWPcode and then starting another session with another name for CodeIgniter after WordPress was loadedli liCOOKIE path Im not 100 sure if I done this right, as it didnt change at all.

Besides that I will get complaints about the codesiteurlcode function, thats already claimed by the URL helper.p  pI think the problem is mainly because both CodeIgniter and WordPress use their own unique way of handling Sessions CI in the Database and WordPress in super globals which probably only makes them use the cookie to remember a state.p  pMy whole CodeIgniter system already runs on the Databasedriven Session models so thats an absolute nogo to make a switch. For WordPress it seems it cant even work with session anymore with its code features I know session do work, but that doesnt seem to count in any way for the WP core system.p  pAlso I quoted out codewpunregisterGLOBALScode in the codewpsettings.phpcode file.p  pPlus that I also tried to rename my session COOKIE name in CodeIgniter to use something like codesessioncicodep  pI really hope someone knows a way to being able to tell CodeIgniter or WordPress to only update their values and dont kill the whole session each time. I also read something about splitting up cookies with code.htaccesscode but cant find good resources on it. So if anyone knows how to do that, I would be eternally grateful.p  pIm in despair.

If WordPress recognizes that you have valid, nonexpired cookies, you go directly to the WordPress Administration interface. If you dont have the cookies, or theyre expired, strongor in some other way invalidstrong like you edited them manually for some reason, WordPress will require you to log in again, in order to obtain new cookies.emp  pI wonder tho, how to bypass that invalid check, which probably is the reason it kills the CodeIgniter cookies Weirdly enough tho, it seems the codesessioncicode value stays, although the session still seems killed.p

Negative 552 pImagine you have a pretty big array of double and a simple function codeavgdouble,sizetcode that computes the average value just a simple example both the array and the function could be whatever data structure and algorithm. I would like that if the function is called a second time and the array is not changed in the meanwhile, the return value comes directly from the previous one, without going through the unchanged data.p  pTo hold the previous value looks simple, I just need a static variable inside the function, right But what about detecting the changes in the array Do I need to write an interface to access the array which sets a flag to be read by the function Can something smarter and more portable be donep

Negative 552 pstrongQuestionstrong  Is there any way to use AudioTrack and setLoopPoints to configure a loop with accuracy based on samplesframes per millisecondp  pstrongEditstrong I understand that perfect accuracy cant be expected from the processing power that most android devices possess. Id like, however, to get an average loop time close to the tempos real interval in milliseconds as this is how Ive based an animation that should also sync with the tempo the animation is a SurfaceView which redraws a lines coordinates over the duration of the tempos interval. p  pstrongDetailsstrong Im trying to use AudioTrack with setLoopPoints to create a accurate metronome.

Negative 552 pIm using codeParallel.ForEachcode to work a bunch of items. The problem is, I want to prioritize which items get worked depending on the number of workers slots that are open. E.g. if I am working 8 parallel things and a slot opens between task 14, I want to assign easy work to those slots. The bottom half of the slots will get the hard work. This way, I wont get all 8 slots tied up doing hardlongrunning work, easyquick items will be run first. Ive implemented this as followsp  pstrongThe Codestrongp  precodeconst int workers  8 ListltThinggt thingsToDo  ... Get the things that need to be done.

I assume that codeParallelcode is looking ahead and getting things to work ready in advance. Id like it to not do this, and only fill a workerslot when it is completely done. The only way Ive thought of to fix this is to add a sleepwait loop in codePrioritizeThingscode which wont return a thing to work until it sees a legitimate open slot. But I dont like that and I was hoping that there was some way to make codeParallelcode wait longer before getting work. Any suggestionsp

Negative 552 pI have an application server written in java that must use different machine learning models based on the request context. For example my request context looks likep  precode class RequestContext        String clientId       String experimentId       String sessionId       ...   codepre  pCurrently I have a delegation logicp  precode ifrequestContext.experimentId  experiment1     ampamp requestContext.clientId  client1       use model 1   else ifrequestContext.experimentId  experiment2            ampamp requestContext.clientId  client1     use model 2   ... codepre  pI could use guavas predicates to express these rules and upon match, delegate to the appropriate model. As a second step, I would like to move these out of the server code to an external configuration store and have the server periodically read from it. This would enable me to not have to deploy server code each time I change the delegation rule. Moreover, I could write a UI that would let the business users define the conditions and the model to use. p  pMy idea is to first specify a list of conditions that are available in this case, clientId, experimentId, and sessionId and allow the user to write a simple javalike script to create the conditions, for example one would writep  precode clientId  client1 ampamp sessionId  session1  experimentId  experiment1 codepre  pthen specify a model to use for when this condition is met. What librarytechniques will help me parse a user specified predicate logic into a guava predicatelike objectp

The to calculate a modulus I take the input now 7.12 divide by 10, subtract the whole number this is decimal so I subtract 0.71 and multiply by 10 again, so Im left with 0.02.p  pIf I run 7.12  10 into C however I get 7.12 as the output. Howp  pWhat am I missing What am I doing wrong This is driving me crazy really need help on this. Why is modulus being used and how is it getting the output its gettingp  pP.S. I do understand Integers dont take decimals so it would output as 7 not 7.12 hence the code says its 7 So I understand that bit.p

I know there are already classes which achieve this but Im trying to build my own as a learning exercise.p  pThe digits of a biguint are stored in the array codestdsizet data[CAPACITY]code with the least significant digit stored in codedata[0]code and the most significant digit in codedata[CAPACITY1]code little endian. For example, if codeCAPACITY5code, then 12345 would be represented as codedata[0]5, data[1]4, data[2]3, data[3]2, data[4]1code.p  pI have successfully built constructors, addition functions, size functions, codeltltcode operator functions, codegtgtcode operator functions, and code[]code operator functions. For example, the following code works.p  precodeint main      biguint b423     biguint c2363     b  c     cout ltlt b ltlt endl     cout ltlt b.size ltlt endl      return 0  codepre  pThat will outputp  precode2786 4 codepre  pOnto the multiplication problem, this is the closest function Ive come up with. It can correctly calculate bigints like 4002 but fails at bigints like 40020 since it rewrites codedata[i]code.p  precodevoid bigintoperator  const bigint ampn      int carryover  0     for sizet i0 i lt size i              for sizet j0 j lt n.size j                      stdcout ltlt data[i] ltlt  ltlt n[j] ltlt              data[i]  n[j]             stdcout ltlt data[i] ltlt stdendl                codepre  pIm trying to do long multiplication like thisp  precode  109   12     218 1090   1308 codepre  pI think the right way to do this would be to create a new bigint but Im getting the error, codelvalue required as left operand of assignmentcode, when I try something like thisp  precodevoid bigintoperator  const biguint ampn      int carryover  0     bigint ans0     for sizet i0 i lt size i              for sizet j0 j lt n.size j                      ans[j]  data[i]  n[i]             ans[j]  carryover             carryover  ans[j]  10             ans[j]  ans[j]  10                codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong Is my approach correct at least What is the correct way of multiplying two numbers stored as an little endian arrayp  pFor reference, this is how I coded the codecode operator. Im basically just doing elementary school addition by hand.p  precodevoid bigintoperator  const biguint ampn      int carryover  0     for sizet i0 i lt CAPACITY i              data[i]  n[i]         data[i]  carryover         carryover  data[i]  10         data[i]  data[i]  10       codepre

Negative 552 pI actually got the idea of this question when I was discussing on another question of mine a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21932544membernotzeroedaclangbugMember not zeroed, a clang buga.  That question is about C11 valueinitialization, but when I saw the C03 valueinitialization rule someone posted there, I am confused.p  pThe valueinitialization rule from C03 isp  blockquote   pTo valueinitialize an object of type T meansp      ul   liif T is a class type clause 9 with a userdeclared constructor 12.1, then the default constructor for T is called and the   initialization is illformed if T has no accessible default   constructorli   liif T is a nonunion class type without a userdeclared constructor, then every nonstatic data member and baseclass component of T is   valueinitializedli   liif T is an array type, then each element is valueinitializedli   liotherwise, the object is zeroinitializedli   ul blockquote  pPlease look at the second bullet which defines the valueinitialize process for a type without userdeclared constructor.  This rule doesnt mention a constructor call.  As we can see from the description of other cases of valueinitialize or from the description of defaultinitialize, if constructor should be called, it will be explicitly mentioned in the text of the standard.  I know there is certain initialization form that constructor doesnt get called e.g. initialization for aggregates, but should it be the case for valueinitialize of codenonunion class type without a userdeclared constructorcode  The implicitly declared constructor of such a type could easily be nontrivial.  For examplep  precodeclass A  public     virtual void f   codepre  pAccording to the rule in C03, if the implicitly declared nontrivial constructor doesnt get called in the process of the valueinitialization of an object of codeAcode, how does the vptr of the object get setup  I know things related to vptr is all implementationdefined, but this doesnt change the major point Im trying to make here.p  pSomeone would argue that the absence of mentioning a constructor call in the rule doesnt mean constructor wont get called.  OK.  Lets say constructor will get called according to some other rule I may have overlooked, but since all members need to be valueinitialized anyway, wouldnt that cause the members constructors to be called more than oncep  pAsking a question for C03 when its already C11 everywhere may seem worthless.  Yeah, thats a valid point.  However, I think I could more or less learn something if I finally figure this out whether I am wrong and why.p  pEDIT Maybe I shouldnt have used vptr as an example. My point is, wouldnt skipping the call to a nontrivial constructor cause some potential problem for the validity of the object  After all, its called nontrivial for a reason.p
Negative 552 pI have a classloading issue in the following project setup our EAR contains multiple WARs, two of which are relevant, lets call them web and ejb. We are using Websphere 8. Now, the ejb.war contains a number of webservices, one of them being newly developed,  some of the classes in ejb.war are generated by axis2 actually. To invoke this ws, and process the response in the web.war, well have to include some jars in the EAR, and adjust the manifests of each war. p  pI included the axiomapi1.2.13.jar into the EAR file, and added to the manifest of both web and ejb WARS. It is needed to process the response, which contains a Base64EncodedFileType object.p  pNow I get the an exception containing the followingp  precodeCaused by java.lang.VerifyError JVMVRFY013 class loading constraint violated classchteledatawsschemabisv36Request ... codepre  pI found this error mentioned here a hrefhttpaxis.apache.orgaxis2javacoredocsappserver.html relnofollowhttpaxis.apache.orgaxis2javacoredocsappserver.htmla  its a known issue regarding webshpere and axis2. I modified the classLoader of WAS as mentioned, but it doesnt solve the problem. The site mentions an axis2.xml, which no matter where I include in the wars  ear, it doesnt have an effect. Has anybody encountered a problem like this What might be still missingp  pMaybe Im not inlcuding another axis2 jar, which would read in the configs Also, Im not sure if I have to include axiom.jar into the EAR but rather the ejb.WAR.p  pIm totally out of ideas where to look for the problem, so dont hesitate to throw questions  directions to me.p  pIf uve read this far, thx for ur timep  pThe

Negative 552 pI have a database where I am using an autoincrement field as the primary key. However, there is another field, studyUID, that will definitely be unique to the table. This studyUID, however, is a string and is typically around 60 characters in length. My thought, perhaps incorrectly, is that it would be faster or better to use the integer from the autoinc field as the primary key  maybe I thought that is just what you do. p  pAs Im writing this Im thinking maybe this doesnt make sense as I will almost always search the database using the studyID field. Based on that logic, maybe it doesnt even make sense to have the autoinc field.p  pWould appreciate comments and thoughts on this subject.p

Negative 552 pInside an web application Pyramid I create certain objects on codePOSTcode which need some work done on them mainly fetching something from the web. These objects are persisted to a PostgreSQL database with the help of SQLAlchemy. Since this tasks can take a while it is not done inside the request handler but rather offloaded to a daemon process on a different host. When the object is created I take its ID which is a client side generated UUID and send it via ZeroMQ to the daemon process. The daemon receives the ID, and fetches the object from the database, does its work and writes the result to the database.p  pProblem The daemon can receive the ID before its creating transaction is commited. Since we are using codepyramidtmcode all database transactions are commited when the request handler returns without an error and I would rather like to leave it this way. On my dev system everything runs on the same box, so ZeroMQ is lightning fast. On the production system this is most likely not an issue since web application and daemon run on different hosts but I dont want to count on this. p  pThis problem only recently manifested itself since we previously used MongoDB with a writeconvern of 2. Having only two database servers the codewritecode on the entity always blocked the webrequest until the entity was persisted which is obviously is not the greatest idea.p  pemHas anyone run into a similar problem How did you solve itemp  pI see multiple possible solutions but moth of them dont satisfy mep  ul liFlushing the transaction manually before triggering the ZMQ message. However, I currently use SQLAlchemy codeaftercreatedcode event to trigger it and this is really nice since it decouples this process completely and thus eliminating the risk of forgetting to tell the daemon to work. Also think that I still would need a codeREAD UNCOMIITEDcode isolation level on the daemon side, is this correctli liAdding a timestamp to the ZMQ message, causing the worker thread that received the message, to wait before processing the object. This obviously limits the throughput.li liDish ZMQ completely and simply poll the database. Nooooli ul

Negative 552 pI am developing a web app based on the Google App Engine.  It has some hundreds of places name, latitude, longitude stored in the Data Store.  My aim is to show them on google map.  Since they are many I have registered a javascript function to the idle event of the map and, when executed, it posts the map boundaries minLat,maxLat,minLng,maxLng to a request handler which should retrieve from the data store only the places in the specified boundaries.p  pThe problem is that it doesnt allow me to execute more than one inequality in the query i.e. Place.latminLat, Place.lntminLng.p  pHow should I do that trying also to minimize the number of required queriesp

Negative 552 pI have a horizontal paging UIScrollView set up to have two pages.  Inside the scrollview there is a content view which has constraints set so that it is the content size of the scrollview.  The content view contains two sub views, page one and page two.  This is working fine, and I can page horizontally between the two pages.  There is no vertical bounce because the pages exactly fill the content size.p  pI havent added anything to the first page yet, but am adding a UITextView to the second page.  This text view has constraints set so that it is centered in page two, and fits within page two.  The intention is that this will just show a short blurb, so scrollEnabled is set to NO for the text view.  The text should easily fit within the space without being cut off.p  pI placed some dummy text in the text view and everything worked fine.  I then increased the font slightly.  While the text still easily fits inside the space allowed, I now receive a vertical bounce on the scrollview  its as if the content size is now vertically larger or the insets have changed.  Ive examined these and they are still exactly the same as they were before the font change.  The intrinsic content size of the text view is slightly bigger because of the increased font size, but again well within the constraints.  What is causing the vertical bounce p  pHere is the code setting up the views and constraints.

Negative 552 pI am having some troubles trying to determine where the best place is to create users and roles for an MVC application. Essentially what I want to do is create an admin role and a user role that is already created BEFORE my application gets the the Home Controller.p  pNow the one thing Im experiencing is that I added the proper code in my Initializer.cs file but when my application runs it goes to go home controller first and when I debug the code it never hits my Initializer.cs since at this point I havent access anything regarding my DataContext. I was unsure exactly what code to include in this since it spans multiple files or if my description is enough for comprehension but I can include code if required.p  pTo make it short and sweet, my goal is to create two roles and add users to the roles BEFORE it hits my HomeController.

Negative 552 pI use c to design a login window for a GUI, in which user first provides username and password, and the program matchs it with the predefined userlist in the MySQL database. If correct, then the user is permitted to open the GUI. p  pI found the password is hashed and salted by PBKDF2SHA256 algorithm in MySQL.

Negative 552 pThe command buttons codeactionListenercode event of the following JSF based xhtml page does not work. I do not have any validations on the page.

Negative 552 pI have created two different plugins from a source plugin. The first plugin contains application logic classes and the second one contains User Interface classes. Currently I am having a problem because one class from application logic uses a static method in the UI plugin and I have to get rid of this dependancy otherwise I will get a circular dependency.p  pThe method should remain in the UI class as it uses eclipse and SWT widgets opens a MessageDialog for the user and I cannot also move the class calling this method to UI plugin as there is a lot of other application logic classes using it and even inheriting from it.p  pI thought the observer pattern will solve the problem but it doesnt since in this case my UI class will be the observer once it gets a notification from the observable logic class, it opens the message dialog and my application logic class is the observable. Consequently when registering the observers, an instance of the UI class is needed. It is also the case when implementing a custom Observer pattern.p  pHow can I solve this problem br I really need help. Thanksp

Negative 552 pWe wrote an unmanaged DLL with  a simple Cstyle API last month. It works and all is fine with it.p  pToday, were writing a demo app using this DLL. This is part of a whole new Solution in Visual Studio 2013.  It compiles and runs fine, until it tries to use the DLLs API, where we get DllNotFoundException.  p  pSame thing happened last week with a test console app. The cheapquick workaround was to copy the DLL from the workspace it was made in, and plop a copy into  binx64Debug in the projects folder in the new workspace.  The problem went away.p  pSure, we could do the same today for the new demo app, and get on with life, but this seems goofy.  We have several test and demo apps, and apps to be given to customers, numbering fifteen or so.  Surely we are not supposed to manually copy the DLL, after every change to it, into fifteen different binx64Debug for fifteen different projects. And more, since well have Release versions too. p  pDespite reading many blogs, articles, MSDN pages about unmanaged DLLs and Solutions and Projects and rightclick to Add References... and all that, Ive not seen any clear explanation how one should deal with multiple projects using one DLL.   Seems like there should be some way we could copy the DLL to one place, and tell all the projects just once to go look there.p  pRelevant Side Question Weve tried the Add References... things, but it didnt like our DLL. Is this not applicable to unmanaged DLLs written in C  We dont see a clear statement whether or not we should be using Add Reference.p

Negative 552 pOk so I have written some code in an attempt to control the motors through the RC receiver in C. The robot controller is based on Arduino chips but this version cannot be programmed through the Arduino environment, I am writing my code in Atmel Studio 6.2 and uploading the code to the robot controller through AVRDUDE as that is the only way to do it. I am including my code in hopes that someone can help me get it figured out. I am trying to make the motors on the R side of the chassis move forward when the pulse is high as well as base its speed on the position of the stick from the pulse. Also move the motors on the R side of the chassis in reverse when the pulse is low as well as have its speed based on the position of the stick from the pulse. Need to do this for both sides of the vehicle. I only need help figuring out one side, after that I can figure out the rest. The RC transmitter R stick controls R side of vehicle, and L stick controls L side of vehicle. As of right now all I can get the motors to do is turn on at full speed in reverse on the R side of the vehicle. p  precodeinclude ltpololuorangutan.hgt  int main   Print battery voltage in mV on the LCD. clear printlongreadbatterymillivoltsx2   Start accepting Pulses on pulseinstartunsigned char[] IOD6, 1 struct PulseInputStruct pulseInfo  while1       Update LCD with battery voltage     lcdgotoxy0,0     printBV      printlongreadbatterymillivoltsx2       get pulse info for the left channel     getpulseinfo0, amppulseInfo      unsigned char Pulse  newhighpulse0       Is there a new high pulse on the left channel     if Pulse  newhighpulse0 ampamp newlowpulse0               Write Pulse to show the first pulse has been received for debugging         int motorSpeed  694  Pulse  2         setm1speedmotorSpeed          lcdgotoxy0,1         printPulse         printunsignedlongtickstomicrosecondspulseInfo.lastHighPulse          else if newlowpulse0 ampamp newhighpulse0              int motorSpeed  694  Pulse  2         setm1speedmotorSpeed          codepre  pOK so list of materials at the bottom.p  pBOM Sort Ofp  ol lipOrangutan X2  VNH2SP30  LCD Robot Controller a hrefhttpswww.pololu.comproduct738 relnofollowhttpswww.pololu.comproduct738apli lipDagu Wild Thumper 6WD Chassis a hrefhttpswww.pololu.comproduct1563 relnofollowhttpswww.pololu.comproduct1563apli ol
Negative 552 pUsing JGroup for forming clusters I want to emulate more than a single node inside Memory and same JVM. The naive solution might be to abstract from JGroup at all and mock messages and status changes. p  pWhat I want and need at least for acceptance tests is the start of two or more processes that uses the real implementations. I dont want the automatic testsuite start to deploy multiple nodes on different VMs. Spawning two JVM should also not be necessary.p  pIf this is not possible with build in tools, I need to abstract form the JGroup API and provide my own testing implementation based on assumptions that might not be correct. So I would love to avoid such a scenario.p  pAny information regarding testing JGroup applications would be appreciated.p

Negative 552 pI am creating tree of files and folder. I am rewriting to multithreading. The only weak point I see is when creating folders. Right now it goes one by one in depth.

One has path ABC and the other one ABD. Lets say I have only A folder existing but not B. So both of them will check that the path doesnt exist and want to create it. So one of them will probably fail because the other one will be faster. So how can I manage thisp  ol liI was thinking about removing the exists condition and leave it fail but there is no AlreadyExists exception I could catch..li liCreate directory tree first but I think there will be better wayli liPut directory creation as critical section and make it sequential  not sure how to do this in spring, but anyway hot sure it is neccessary and wont slow down the process too much.li ol  pMaybe I am overthinking too much, but theoretically such situation might happen. Currently I use regular Thread, but I want to use spring TaskExecutor for this. It handles critical sections on its own, but this is not shared variable or anything and the path is different so I think it wont recognize it.p  pThanks for suggestions.p

Negative 552 pSo I started using python requests to look at the html code from some websites. I would do r  requests.geturl to get all the information I need. p  pHowever, I noticed that this doesnt work sometimes. For example, Im using steamcommunity.com to get some market data, so I used the url a hrefhttpsteamcommunity.commarketsearch relnofollowhttpsteamcommunity.commarketsearcha. This brings up the first page of items out of over 7,000 pages. To get a different page, I used this url a hrefhttpsteamcommunity.commarketsearchp4quantitydesc relnofollowhttpsteamcommunity.commarketsearchp4quantitydesca. This should take you to the 4th page of the website, and it does if you put it in your browser. But, when I go to read the html code, I get the same code from both urls, even though they should point to different pages with different code.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated Thanksp

Sadly, Im not particularly adept at shell scripting, so Im a little hazy on what exactly it does. p  pThe point, though, is that I dont think the git hook is using this version of codecdcode. I base this on the output of this command codeshopt s extdebug  declare F cdcode which I found a hrefhttpsuperuser.comquestions283352howdoyourunashellcommandscriptautomaticallywhenenteringcdingadirecherea. When I run it myself, the output is codecd 14 Usersimclean.rvmscriptscdcode  showing where RVM defines codecdcode, whereas if I have my git hook run and echo that same command, it outputs a blank line.p

Negative 552 pThe C standard makes clear that a compilerlibrary combination is allowed to do whatever it likes with the following codep  precodeint doubleFreechar p    int temp  p   freep   freep   return temp  codepre  pIn the event that a compiler does not require use of a particular bundled library, however, is there anything in the C standard which would forbid a library from defining a meaningful behavior  As a simple example, suppose code were written for a platform which had referencecounted pointers, such that following codep  malloc1234 addrefp addrefpcode the first two calls to codefreepcode would decrement the counter but not free the memory.  Any code written for use with such a library would naturally work only with such a library and the codeaddrefcode calls would likely fail on most others, but such a feature could be helpful in many cases when e.g. it is necessary to pass the a string repeatedly to a method which expects to be given a string produced with codestrdupcode and consequently calls codefreecode on it.p  pIn the event that a library would define a useful behavior for some action like doublefreeing a pointer, is there anything in the C standard which would authorize a compiler to unilaterally break itp

Each thread performs a computation and stores the results of that computation in an SQLite table recreating the table if necessary. Each thread creates its own connection to the database.

Other problems I found with joomla is object based programming. when we come to complex systems with more inherited objects it becomes such a mess with files, basically I would need to create set of rules by which I will organize so many models. To create Joomla library would be fine, but then, why would need a joomla Also objects are mess in current site, there are gods objects, design of mysql database is really messed up, multiplicated fields, deprecated fields, etc. and some parts of site are hard coded and very complicated.p  pDo you think there is any reason why I might be wrong about moving, except time to do it and admin experience of Joomlap

I guess what im asking is whether there is a way in angular to access the data and render for the first few templates and let the user navigate the page, while the rest are in the process of rendering. p  precodeltcompanyheader ctrlinfoCtrl classcompanyfixedheadergtltcompanyheadergt ltdiv classwrapgt     ltdiv classdynamiccontainergt           ltdiv classcontentgt             ltsection iddetailsgt                 ltcompanyIdentifiersList ctrlinfoCtrlgtltcompanyIdentifiersListgt                 ltcontactInformationList ctrlinfoCtrlgtltcontactInformationListgt                 ltcompanyInformationList ctrlinfoCtrlgtltcompanyInformationListgt                 ltregulatoryFilingList ctrlinfoCtrlgtltregulatoryFilingListgt                 ltsecuritiesManuals ctrlinfoCtrlgtltsecuritiesManualsgt             ltsectiongt             ltsection idsecuritiesgt                 ltsecurityinfo ctrlinfoCtrlgtltsecurityinfogt             ltsectiongt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre
