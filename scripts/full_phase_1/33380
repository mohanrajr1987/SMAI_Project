Positive 33380 pI sometimes have problems with my IAP after users update my app from the app store. My receipt verification fails and I didnt log the reason until now. Is there no receipt or is it invalid... I dont know yet... So Id like to refresh the receipt if my validation fails. But the problem is that a dialog will pop up asking the user for its iTunes Credentials.p  pSo basically Id like to avoid that dialog and only show it to users where the receipt is really broken and needs to be updated. Not to users who just didnt buy my IAP. For those users this dialog would be really confusing I guess....p  pSo my question now is strongWhen should a valid receipt be presentstrong Do appupdates break receiptsp  pFrom the documentation I found the followingp  pcodeappStoreReceiptURL For an application purchased from the App Store, use this application bundle property to locate the receipt.

Positive 33380 pI have an app that uses parse.com as backend.  If I want to store information about users inapp purchases in table there, how can I be sure that some guy is not going to create a simple app where users of my app can log like in my own in and write in parsetables whatever they want for ex. that they made inapps when they really didnt.

Positive 33380 pIm newbie if it comes to the inapp purchase subject.

Negative 33380 pI have a problem perplexing me to no end.  When I run the following query against an access databasep  precodeSELECT  FROM PreferredSpacer INNER JOIN SpacerThickness ON  PreferredSpacer.SpacerTypeID  SpacerThickness.SpacerTypeID ORDER BY PreferredSpacer.UnitTypeID DESC codepre  pUnitTypeID field is a text typep  pThe results do not come out sorted as a normal person would expect.  They are all over the place with respect to the UnitTypeID field There are entries starting with W between entries starting with C and M.  If I remove the join and just try to order the records in the PreferredSpacer table which contains the UnitTypeID field I get my expected results, so I must assume the join has something to do with it.p  pAt the same time however, I honestly cant imagine a tool as ubiquitus as access could have such a glaring issue with a fairly basic query.  If I am doing something wrong  however  I am not able to see what it could be.p  pAny assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.p
Negative 33380 pI have over the course of a few projects developed a pattern for creating immutable readonly objects and immutable object graphs. Immutable objects carry the benefit of being 100 thread safe and can therefore be reused across threads. In my work I very often use this pattern in Web applications for configuration settings and other objects that I load and cache in memory. Cached objects should always be immutable as you want to guarantee they are not unexpectedly changed.p  pNow, you can of course easily design immutable objects as in the following examplep  precodepublic class SampleElement    private Guid id   private string name    public SampleElementGuid id, string name        this.id  id     this.name  name       public Guid Id        get  return id        public string Name        get  return name      codepre  pThis is fine for simple classes  but for more complex classes I do not fancy the concept of passing all values through a constructor. Having setters on the properties is more desirable and your code constructing a new object gets easier to read. p  pSo how do you create immutable objects with settersp  pWell, in my pattern objects start out as being fully mutable until you freeze them with a single method call. Once an object is frozen it will stay immutable forever  it cannot be turned into a mutable object again. If you need a mutable version of the object, you simply clone it.p  pOk, now on to some code. I have in the following code snippets tried to boil the pattern down to its simplest form. The IElement is the base interface that all immutable objects must ultimately implement. p  precodepublic interface IElement  ICloneable    bool IsReadOnly  get    void MakeReadOnly  codepre  pThe Element class is the default implementation of the IElement interfacep  precodepublic abstract class Element  IElement    private bool immutable    public bool IsReadOnly        get  return immutable        public virtual void MakeReadOnly        immutable  true       protected virtual void FailIfImmutable        if immutable throw new ImmutableElementExceptionthis       ...  codepre  pLets refactor the SampleElement class above to implement the immutable object patternp  precodepublic class SampleElement  Element    private Guid id   private string name    public SampleElement     public Guid Id        get              return id           set            FailIfImmutable       id  value            public string Name        get              return name           set            FailIfImmutable       name  value          codepre  pYou can now change the Id property and the Name property as long as the object has not been marked as immutable by calling the MakeReadOnly method. Once it is immutable, calling a setter will yield an ImmutableElementException.p  pFinal note The full pattern is more complex than the code snippets shown here. It also contains support for collections of immutable objects and complete object graphs of immutable object graphs. The full pattern enables you to turn an entire object graph immutable by calling the MakeReadOnly method on the outermost object. Once you start creating larger object models using this pattern the risk of leaky objects increases. A leaky object is an object that fails to call the FailIfImmutable method before making a change to the object. To test for leaks I have also developed a generic leak detector class for use in unit tests. It uses reflection to test if all properties and methods throw the ImmutableElementException in the immutable state.  In other words TDD is used here.p  pI have grown to like this pattern a lot and find great benefits in it. So what I would like to know is if any of you are using similar patterns If yes, do you know of any good resources that document it I am essentially looking for potential improvements and for any standards that might already exist on this topic.p
Negative 33380 pCurrently we call codeMiniDumpWriteDumpcode with the codeMiniDumpNormal  MiniDumpWithIndirectlyReferencedMemorycode flags. That works just fine for internal builds in Debug configuration, but isnt giving as much information as we need in Release configuration.p  pIn Release, the minidump data contains enough stack information for the debugger to work out where in the code the failure occurred, but no other data. I dont simply mean local variables are missing due to being optimised out, as youd expect in a Release build  I mean, there is nothing useful except for the call stack and current code line. No registers, no locals, no globals, no objects pointed to by locals  nothing. We dont even get this which would allow us to view the current object. That was the point of using codeMiniDumpWithIndirectlyReferencedMemorycode  it should have included memory referenced by locals and stack variables, but doesnt seem to.p  pWhat flags should we be using instead We dont want to use codeMiniDumpWithFullMemorycode and start generating 600MB dumps, but would happily expand the dumps somewhat beyond the 90KB we currently get if it meant getting more useful data. Perhaps we should be using codeMiniDumpWithDataSegmentscode globals or...p

Negative 33380 pShouldnt be hard, right Rightp  pI am currently trawling the OpenAFS codebase to find the header definition of pioctl. Ive thrown everything Ive got at it checked ctags, grepped the source code for pioctl, etc. The closest Ive got to a lead is the fact that theres a file pioctlnt.h that contains the definition, except its not actually what I want because none of the userspace code directly includes it, and its Windows specific.p  pNow, Im not expecting you to go and download the OpenAFS codebase and find the header file for me.

Negative 33380 pI am writing a GUI oriented debugger which targets Linux primarily, but I plan ports to other OSes in the future. Because the GUI must stay interactive at all times, I have a few threads handling different things.p  pPrimarily I have a debug event thread which simply loops waiting for waitpid to return and delivers the received events to the other threads. I do this because waitpid does not have a timeout, which makes it very hard to integrate it with other event loops and keep things responsive waitpid can hang indefinitely.p  pThis strategy has worked wonderfully for the Linux builds so far. Lately Ive been trying to make my debugger thread aware as in the threads in the debugged application, not the debugger itself.p  pSo I set the ptrace options to follow clone events and look for a status which has the upper 16bit set to codePTRACEEVENTCLONEcode. Then I use codePTRACEGETEVENTMSGcode to get the TID of the new thread. This all works nicely in my small test harness applications. But for some reason, it is failing when i put that code in my actual debugger. I get a No such process error codep  pThe one thing that occurred to me is that Windows has a rule that only the thread which attached to an application can listen for debug events. Does Linuxs ptrace have a similar limitation If so, why does my code work for other debug eventsp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIt seems that at the very least waitpid supports waiting from a different thread, the man page saysp  blockquote   pBefore Linux 2.4, a thread was just a    special  case  of  a process,  and as a    consequence one thread could not wait on the   children of another thread, even when   the latter belongs to the same thread   group.  However, POSIX prescribes   such functionality, and since Linux 2.4 a    thread can, and by default   will, wait on children of other   threads in the same thread group.p blockquote  pSo at most this is a ptrace limitation.p

Negative 33380 pIm a bit uncertain about the relation between the Unified Modeling Language UML and the different modelling perspectives conceptual, specification and impelementation endorsed by RUP among other OOAD methodologies.p  pFrom what I understand the same type of diagram using the same notation can have different meaning depending on the perspective being used. For instance the class diagram can represent an abstraction of real world systems  phenomena in the conceptual perspective and when perspective is later changed to specificationimplementation the class diagram is used to abstract constructs of a computer program. p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  p1 It is my understanding that certain rules exist for a UML class diagram in general. For instance that a class can extend another class but that it cant extend an association. strongWhere are the entities of the class diagram and the rules about how they can relate defined Does it all take place at the M2 layer in the UML metamodeling architecturestrong  see wikipedias illustratio of metamodel architecturestrongstrongp  p2 A related question. The way I see it, the general rules for a specific diagram span the modelling perspectives again, it is absurd for a class to extend an association, but the different modelling perspectives will superimpose certain meaning to a particular type of diagram. For instance an association in the class diagram of the domain model conceptual perspective will inherently be bidirectional whereas it can be either bi or unidirectional in the class diagram of the design model specification  implementation perspective. p  pIn the scenario just described the rule superimposed limits the properties of an association. strongIs it a correct assumption that rules superimposed by perspectives will always be a subsetlimitation of the rules defined by the uml metamodel and never a supersetstrongp  pstrongAre these ruleslimitations defined by the perspectives formalized in a way similar to the metamodel or are they mere conventions described in the OOAD litteraturestrong p  pcodecode Perspectives are explained in paragraph 10.8 a hrefhttpbooks.google.co.ukbooksidr8i4Enaa4Campprintsecfrontcoveramphldaampsourcegbsv2summaryrampcad0 relnofollowhttpbooks.google.co.ukbooksidr8i4Enaa4Campprintsecfrontcoveramphldaampsourcegbsv2summaryrampcad0ap

It might be a kill on the resources of machine A.p  pb It is machine A that needs to send the data when it wants. Machine B does not know emwhenem there will be data for it. In the current design, machine B will have to keep polling machine A repeatedly with a TCP connection asking if it has any data for it or not. This can get expensive if there are many machine Bs.p  pIs there a less expensive way to solve this problem The Observer design pattern comes to mind. Machine B could subscribe to a notification from machine A to inform it when data becomes available.

Obviously, this data only relates to some of the rows in the table. I end up having a lot of NULL fields in each row as a result.  p  pI can give more specifics if necessary. Thanks in advance for any general advice. p

Negative 33380 pI have a question about improving the efficiency of my program.  I have a Dictionaryltstring, Thingeygt defined to hold named Thingeys.  This is a web application that will create multiple named Thingeys over time.  Thingeys are somewhat expensive to create not prohibitively so but Id like to avoid it whenever possible.  My logic for getting the right Thingey for the request looks a lot like thisp  precode    private Dictionaryltstring, Thingeygt Thingeys     public Thingey GetThingeyRequest request              string thingeyName  request.ThingeyName         if this.Thingeys.ContainsKeythingeyName                       create a new thingey on 1st reference             Thingey newThingey  new Thingeyrequest             lock this.Thingeys                              if this.Thingeys.ContainsKeythingeyName                                      this.Thingeys.AddthingeyName, newThingey                                   else  oops someone else beat us to it                  newThingey will eventually get GCed                                return this. Thingeys[thingeyName]      codepre  pIn this application, Thingeys live forever once created.  We dont know how to create them or which ones will be needed until the app starts and requests begin coming in. The question I have is in the above code is there are occasional instances where newThingey is created because we get multiple simultaneous requests for it before its been created.  We end up creating 2 of them but only adding one to our collection. Is there a better way to get Thingeys created and added that doesnt involve checkcreatelockcheckadd with the rare extraneous thingey that we created but end up never using  And this code works and has been running for some time.  This is just the nagging bit that has always bothered me.p  pIm trying to avoid locking the dictionary for the duration of creating a Thingey.p

I hope I make myself clear. As an added bonus I would like to make the algorithm pick as few numbers as possible to make the required sum, or give out an error if the sum cannot be made with the numbers supplied.p  pI thought about using recursion and iterating through the array, adding numbers over and over until the sum is met or gone past. But what I cant get my head around is what to do if the algorithm goes past the sum and needs to be selective about what numbers to pick from the array.p  pIm not looking for complete code, or a complete algorithm, I just want your opinions on how I should proceed with this and perhaps share a few tips or something. Ill probably start work on this tonight. Pp  pAs I said, not homework. Just me wanting to do something a bit more advanced.p  pThanks for any help youre able to offer. p

However when i click a div how do i find out what i is I have used codevar data  this.parent.parent.find.valuestr.eq0.valcode which is extremely simple. Should i use a script or should i continue to do it with a textarea if i should use a script 1 Whats the easiest way to find i and 2 Is it bad pratice to have dozens or hundreds of codeltscriptgtcode in my html or i can go through the loop twice but i still dont know the easiest way to find i. I would have to store it somewhere or go through multiple tags and count them.p

Negative 33380 pThe integrated Web Deployment in Visual Studio 2010 is pretty nice. It can create a package ready to be deployed using MSDeploy on a target IIS machine. Problem is, this package will be redistributed to a client that will install it himself using the Import Application from IIS when MSDeploy is installed.p  pThe default package created always include the full path from the development machine, DDevXXXobjDebugPackagePackageTmp in the source manifest file. It doesnt prevent installation of course since it was designed this way, but it looks ugly in the import dialog and has no meaning to the client. Worse he will wonder what are those paths and it looks quite confusing.p  pBy customizing the .csproj file by adding MSBuild properties used by the package creation task, I managed to add additional parameters to the package. However, I spent most of the afternoon in the 2600 lines long Web.Publishing.targets trying to understand what parameter influenced the development path behavior, in vain. I also tried to use the setAcl to customize security on a given folder after deployment, but I only managed to do this with MSBuild by using a relative path... it shouldnt matter if I resolve the first problem though.p  pI could modify the generated archive after its creation but I would prefer if everything was automatized using MSBuild. Does anyone know how to do thatp

Negative 33380 pOk, so heres my problem.  We are looking at purchasing a data set from a company to augment our existing data set.  For the purposes of this question, lets say that this data set ranks places with an organic number meaning that the number assigned to one place has no bearing on the number assigned to another.  The technical range is 0 to infinity, but from sample sets that Ive seen, its 0 to 70.  Based on the sample, its most definitely not a uniform distribution out of 10,000 there are maybe 5 places with a score over 40, 50 with a score over 10, and 1000 with a score over 1.  Before we decide to purchase this set, we would like to simulate it so that we can see how useful it may be.p  pSo, to simulate it, Ive been thinking about generating a random number for each place about 150,000 random numbers.  But, I also want to keep to the spirit of the data, and keep the distribution relatively the same or at least reasonably close.  Ive been racking my brain all day trying to think of a way to do it, and have come up empty.p  pOne thought I had was to square the random number between 0 and sqrt70.  But that would favor both less than 1 and larger numbers.  p  pIm thinking that he real distribution should be hyperbolic in the first quadrant...  Im just blanking on how to turn a linear, even distribution of random numbers into a hyperbolic distribution If hyperbolic is even what I want in the first place.p  pAny thoughtsp  pSo, to sum, heres the distribution I would like approximatelyp  ul li40  70 0.02  0.05li li10  40 0.5  1li li1  10 10  20li li0  1  Remainder 78.95  89.48li ul

Negative 33380 pIve implemented a web based instant messaging  chat feature using http binding and ejabberd. For the lazy heres the short version of my questionp  pHow would you go about implementing a web based XMPP chat client which could be displayed in multiple browser windows simultaneously, each displaying an identical view of the open chatsp  pMore detailed ramblings for those who carep  pOne potential solution would be to just let every tab manage its own connection. XMPP has decent enough support for multiple clients so let it do the routing. I have at least 2 issues with this solution. 1 is the obvious increase in bandwidth consumption this would cause. 2 is the current lack of support for multiple clients with the same JID to connect to MUC rooms in ejabberd. This will apparently be implemented for 3.1 but its a major issue for me as it stands.p  pInitially I wondered if there might be some flash magic involved but it seems the swf on the page is only used to play the notification sound effects. You can confirm this by using firebug or similar to delete the embed tag. The chat feature still works.p  pThis basically leaves me with cookies as the only way to share between the tabs. In this scenario a master tab would dump all messages to cookies which could be polled from other tabs. This seems quite ridiculous to me as the poll frequency would have to be exceptionally high to avoid any latency. What would happen when the master window was closedp  pIve seen this done by more than one site and normally when I look at problems like these I can at least understand at least vaguely how Id go about it but I dont mind admitting this one has got me stumped. p

Negative 33380 pId like to start using unit tests, but Im having a hard time understanding how I can use them with my current project. p  pMy current project is an application which collects files into a Catalog. A codeCatalogcode can then extract information from the files it contains such as thumbnails and other properties. Users can also tag the files with other custom meta data such as Author and Notes.

However, the majority of my classes are never meant to be instantiated on their own. Instead everything happens through my codeCatalogcode class. For example theres no way I can test my codeFilecode class on its own, as a codeFilecode is only accessible through a codeCatalogcode. p  pAs an alternative to unit tests I think it would make more sense for me to write a test program that run through a series of actions including creating a catalog, reopening the catalog that was created, and manipulating the contents of the catalog.

Id heard the term in the past, but never really understood what a mock was until now. I understand how I could create a mock of my IFile interface, which represents a single file in a catalog.

Negative 33380 pSo I have a color picker. Users can pick colors using RGB or HSB. There are slidersproperties for each value. When user sets Red for example, I will calculate HSB values to reflect new color value. When user sets Hue, the RGB value will be recalculated from the HSB values. But see theres a loop there. When I set RGB it must recalculate HSB values, ok so far, but it also means that HSB values will change causing RGB values to be re updated again. I think this is where the problem is but how can I fix thisp  h1UPDATE One Possible Solutionh1  pOne possible solution I used was flag, not very readable tho, but it works.

Negative 33380 pI have contemplating how to handle paper document input in Webapps for some time. The main problem is how to unify metadata and a scanned PDF. For the sake of this example I will present a hypothetical Expense Claim Application. Approaches I have considered so farp  ul listrongWeb 1.0strong, Open a webpage, create an expense claim amp enter data, switch to scanning app, scan to file, switch to Browser, click on choose file navigate to scanned file upload it. Pros simple to code. Cons terrible workflow, every workstation needs a scanner and drivers and disk space, etc.  might not work with thin clients Citrix  the IPadli listrongBarcode Stylestrong Open a webpage, create an expense claim amp enter data, save, a barcode sticker is printed, stick barcode onto paper. At the end of the day scan all barcoded papers. bulk upload them and assign them based on the barcode to the expense claims. OCRing barcodes in scans is a solved issue, e.g. see a hrefhttpwww.exactcode.desiteopensourceexactimagebardecode relnofollowexactCODEa Pros decent workflow, one scanner per department is enough. Cons need barcode label printers at every workstation easier than scanners but not cheaper, scanned papers become only available after a few hoursli listrongWeb 2.0 Stylestrong Scan with a local scanner to a [Dropbox] folder.  Webapp uses the a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comdevelopers relnofollowDropbox APIa to detect new scans, present them to the user and ask them for entering the MetaData. Pros nice Workflow. Cons Everybody needs a Scanner, Webapp cant just popup and say theres a new scan available.li listrongBatch Stylestrong Somebody scans all documents separating them by person which has to process them or by type of document Expense Claim, Invoice, Order. Documents get batch uploaded e.g. as an ZIP to the Webserver in a queue. A person now have to work through this queue and enter the required meta data. Pros Only a single Scanner needs to maintained. Cons Staff doesnt have the paper at hand anymore, only the online version. This is considered a big show stopper by my colleagues.li listrongBarcode Batchstrong Somebody barcodelabels all incoming documents, scans them in a single folder and bulkuploads them to a repository, then distributes the paper the old fashioned way to the different departments. People processing an expense claim also enter the barcode number from the paper. The Webapp contacts the repository and retrieves based on the barcode number the scanned document and saves it together with the metadata. PPros simple to code, Cons lot of paper still wandering around, documents might gat scanned which probably never should enter a digital repository  e.g. medical records li listrongDesktop appstrong Write an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTWAIN relnofollowTWAINa based small Desktop application which scans, uploads to the Webapp and opens a browser window to add the metadata.

Negative 33380 pI have a welcome page JSP file for my application that contains some dynamic content.br e.g. recent posts links, most active categories etc.  p  pTo make this work I need to make some data store queries that return these data. this is pretty much unoptimized. especially in the home page and makes its loading time big as compared to hard coding these links in the JSP file.  p  pI am thinking of updating the static JSP file every day with latest data by using a cron task. thus, actually generating a JSP file and replacing the old one. Do you think this is possible I am also open to any ideas  p  pthanksp

Negative 33380 pI have designed a basic search in ASPC for searching through records in a database and have provided the user with these fields which they can use to search wordphrase, dateFrom, dateTill.

Pretty simple stuff.p  pThe text entered by the user into the fields is injected directly into an SQL statement like followsp  precodeSELECT r.idRecord, r.recordText FROM record r WHERE LOWERCASTr.recordText AS VARCHAR LIKE LOWER  wordphrase     AND r.creationDate BETWEEN   dateFrom   AND   dateTill   codepre  pSo still pretty simple and it works like a charm when the user enters dates in an American format, mmddyyyy.

What I dont understand is what happens afterp  p1 To run the queries concurrently the db driver has to have some kind of threadingconnection pool, rightp  p2 In the scope of one request What happens after sending two queries renderView cant be called because the queries have not returned yet. How do we wait for the queries to return Should it keep count of the callbacks pending to be fired before continuing The basic thought I had wasp  ponRequest  run async code  wait for callbacks  construct response. The waiting in this case would be blocking so you would effectively need to spawn a thread for each onRequest. How is the waiting for callbacks to run before constructing response donep  p3 How does the db driver inform the eventloop that its done and the callback it has for it needs to be called with the query resultsp  p4 How does the event loop run the callback inside the anonymous function we created with the onRequest event Is this where the closure concept comes in where the context is saved in the callback functionp  p4 Now that we have the db results, how do we continue executing the coderenderViewres.writeres.endcode partsp

everyone... So I have fixed the problems described and have now updated the codes as follows Since copy and pasting the code files in question back on here will take the character limit over the 30,000 limit, I have uploaded the files to MediaFire.com a hrefhttpwww.mediafire.comq38d8i4yaqh1p97 relnofollowherea.p  pAnyway, after fixing this code I am able to fill the form with some data and successfully fill my database will be fixing things such as duplicate users later on. The flaw with this is if I press the submit button without entering anything in any fields I still get a message saying my registration has been successful, and my database gets filled with default values or nothing at all. I have listed these details belowp  ul liuserid 1li liuseremail BLANKli liuserpass some hashed value using a combination of md5 and sha encryptionli liuserpassconfirm same as aboveli liuserusername BLANKli lifirstname BLANKli lilastname BLANKli ligender Maleli libirthdateday 1stli libirthdatemonth Januaryli libirthdateyear 0li liphoneNumber 0 li limobileNumber 0 li liaddressline1 BLANK li liaddressline1 BLANK li liaddressline1 BLANK li listateprovince BLANK li lipostcode 0li liclosesttown 0li ul  pInstead of ANYTHING being inserted, I should be seeing the error messages I specified in the php code for registerprocessing.php. What I am wanting is if a user tries to submit the form without filling ANY of the fields themselves, the error warnings will show on the registerprocessing.php page, and then the user can go back to the form and fill it out. Maybe there is something wrong with how I am checking for errors or checking the fields for non input, but I have tried and tested a few versions to try and fix everything but nothing works. Any help will be greatly appreciated p

Negative 33380 pWe have a 160 project VS2010 C solution.  I start with a completely empty output directory, and Build Solution.  I have the IDE build verbosity set to Normal.  During the build, I watch the Output window.  VS2010 is set to build 2 projects at a time, each compiling only 1 .cpp file at a time.p  pMost projects show numerous output lines from the compiler each .cpp filename and the librarianlinker.p  pBut some projects 10 in the latest run show EXTREMELY minimal output.

If I understand a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comdocscdE1865901html8211384bjbds.htmlthis page by Oracle describing the format used for number on SPARCa correctly, the SPARC uses the opposite endian as x86 for integers embut the same endian as x86 for floats and doublesem.  However, PB encodes floatsdoubles by first casting them directly to an integer type of the appropriate size via means of a union  see the snippets of code quoted in my question above, and then reversing the order of the bytes on platforms with bigendian integersp  precodevoid CodedOutputStreamWriteLittleEndian64uint64 value    uint8 bytes[sizeofvalue]    bool usefast  buffersize gt sizeofvalue   uint8 ptr  usefast  buffer  bytes    WriteLittleEndian64ToArrayvalue, ptr    if usefast      Advancesizeofvalue    else      WriteRawbytes, sizeofvalue      inline uint8 CodedOutputStreamWriteLittleEndian64ToArrayuint64 value,                                                             uint8 target  if definedPROTOBUFLITTLEENDIAN   memcpytarget, ampvalue, sizeofvalue else   uint32 part0  staticcastltuint32gtvalue   uint32 part1  staticcastltuint32gtvalue gtgt 32    target[0]  staticcastltuint8gtpart0   target[1]  staticcastltuint8gtpart0 gtgt  8   target[2]  staticcastltuint8gtpart0 gtgt 16   target[3]  staticcastltuint8gtpart0 gtgt 24   target[4]  staticcastltuint8gtpart1   target[5]  staticcastltuint8gtpart1 gtgt  8   target[6]  staticcastltuint8gtpart1 gtgt 16   target[7]  staticcastltuint8gtpart1 gtgt 24 endif   return target  sizeofvalue  codepre  pThis, however, is exactly the wrong thing for it to be doing in the case of floatsdoubles on SPARC since the bytes are already in the correct order.p  pSo in conclusion, if my understanding is correct then floating point numbers are strongnotstrong transportable between SPARC and x86 using PB, because essentially PB assumes that all numbers are stored with the same endianess relative to other platforms as the integers on a given platform, which is an incorrect assumption to make on SPARC.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pAs Lyke pointed out, IEEE 64bit floating points emareem stored in bigendian order on SPARC, in contrast to x86.  However, only the two 32bit words are in reverse order, not all 8 of the bytes, and in particular IEEE 32bit floating points look like they are stored in the same order as on x86.p

Negative 33380 pIm writing a webapp that basically allows users to kick off shell scripts with parameters they enter through various forms. After doing some research I believe ProcessBuilder to be the best way to run the shell scripts, however Ive got some conditions that I need to meet and was hoping some others could tell me if Im thinking along the correct lines.p  pThe scripts that will be kicked off can literally take a few hours to run. So obviously I cant have the app pause and wait for that long. So Im wondering if threads is the answer to that problem Im not very experienced with using threads and looking for some advice. Should I kick off the ProcessBuilder in a new thread so that the main web app will continue to run Will that even work Is it as simple as just declaring a new thread and assigning the process builder to it Do I have to worry about having various threads running or created Just not sure of what to be on the look out for or what pitfalls to keep aware of.p  pAlso, I really need a way to be able to at least check on the status of the process once it is running. The requirements call for some way to show how far along the process is, but I dont know that that is possible. I believe being able to at the very least show that it is still running should be acceptable. How would I go about detecting thatp  pFor some more info its a JavaSpring web app and will be running on some flavor of Unix. Thanks for any thoughts and help.p

Negative 33380 pI am currently using resque and resquescheduler in an application that will have to handle a lot of recurring jobs  do this every hour, do this every day etc. At the moment, I simply queue up the next run of the job in the job itself, the HourlyJob queue has a .enqueueat1.hour.fromnow, HourlyJob etc.p  pShould I be doing this It feels like I should have a static recurring job using resqueschedulers crontype functionality that then schedules up say the next 5 minutes worth of delayed jobs... but all I am really doing is moving the work from the probably fast, redis based resquescheduler to my probably less well implemented, mysql based code, surelyp  pIs there anything wrong with how Im doing it nowp

Negative 33380 pI have a Service in my application which is designed to run every 10 minutes. It basically checks up on our servers to see if everything is running properly and notifies the user of any problems. I created this application for internal use at our company.p  pMy coworker used the application over the long weekend and noticed that no checks were performed when the device went to sleep. I was under the impression that the Service was supposed to keep running in the background until I explicitly call codestopServicecode in my code.p  pSo ultimately, my goal is to have the service running until the user hits the off button in the application or kills the process.p  pI heard about something called codeWakeLockcode which is meant to keep the screen from turning off, which is not what I want.

Other properties can only be altered according to strict business rules, which all have strictly validating setters and getters.p  pThe object does not represent a database record per se, the database is only seen as emoneem possible form of permanent storage.

Negative 33380 pOne thing I dont understand with sending Async emails from ASP.NET page is when we call SendAsync it should be executed on a separate thread so our page can continue its execution flow and finish its response no matter how long the sending will take.p  ol lipHow then we can call method on the same page using codeSendCompletedEventHandlercode The page object might not exist by that time and in this forum there are examples that people doing that.pli lipMy expectation was that I can have separate class which might have static method which I will execute on codeSendCompletedEventHandlercode and this way we can report possible errors. However when Im raising exception in there the exception comes as part of Page Response.

Negative 33380 pIm working on a project that uses Linq2SQL for data access. The project is made up of an ASP.NET MVC application and 8 class libraries. Most of the class libraries have their own L2S data classes.p  pAs part of the work Im doing, Im trying to get the various components under test to introduce some stability clean up the codebase, it currently makes heavy use of static classes and methods, and the controllers have static DataContexts which are used throughout. p  pHow can I refactor the L2S usage so that I can test the controller actionsp  pIve introduced dependency injection into the app to decouple some of the other services but I  dont want the DataContext as a dependency  property of the controllers because I want to control the instantiation of the DataContexts and their DataLoadOptions.p  pOne thing I did try was taking advantage of the partial classes that L2S generates and added an Interface to the DataContexts, but I found that the abstraction bubbled its way up into the application rather than staying down in the class libraries. It didnt feel like the right way of doing things and that it would be a pain to maintain. Has anyone had any particular success or failure with this method  p

Negative 33380 pThis may well be a dumb question and if this has already been answered elsewhere then Id really appreciate it if someone could point me to it as my searching hasnt turned up anything definitive.   p  hr  pIn a nutshell, my problem is that when I do childThread.Join in the UI thread on a child thread which has been flagged to stop the childThread seems to block as well as the main thread so everything just hangs.br That the UI will block due to using Join is not a problem in and of itself at the moment since the childThread should finish in under a second after its told to quit anyway.br This happens while Im waiting for a thread running a repeating process to quit before I can run another method which returns some information but cant be run at the same time as the other process.p  pMy Winforms application is integrating with a piece of usb hardware by pinvoking the C API for the hardware.p  pThe hardware API has a method that will start off a process that will run indefinitely and repeatedly and rapidly callback with new information which I then need to pass to the UI.br This operation can be cancelled by another call to the hardware API which sets a flag the hardware can see so it knows to quit.br Ive wrapped this C API with my own C code, and within the wrapper Ive had to spin out the start process call in another thread so that the activity doesnt block the UI.    p  pHere are the edited highlights of roughly what Im doing.p  precodepublic class DeviceWrapper      Thread childThread  null      void DeviceWrapper               Set the callback to be used by the StartGettingInformation process         PInvokeMethods.SetGetInformationCallbackInformationAcquiredCallback           public void StartProcess              childThread  new Threadnew ThreadStartGetInformationProcess         childThread.Start           void GetInformationProcess              PInvokeMethods.StartGettingInformation           This callback occurs inside the childThread     void InformationAcquiredCallbackStatus status, IntPtr information              This callback is triggered when anything happens in the          StartGettingInformation method, such as when the information          is ready to be retrieved, or when the process has been cancelled.         ifstatus  Status.InformationAcquired                      FireUpdateUIEvent                  If the cancel flag has been set to true this will be hit.         else ifstatus  Status.Cancelled                       Reset the cancel flag so the next operation works ok             PInvokeMethods.SetCancelFlagfalse               childThread.Abort                    This method runs once, and cant run at the same time as GetInformationProcess     public string GetSpecificInformation              This triggers InformationAcquiredCallback with a status of Cancelled         StopProcess           ifchildThread.IsAlive                      childThread.Join                   return PInvokeMethods.GetSpecificInformation           public void StopProcess              PInvokeMethods.SetCancelFlagtrue       codepre  pUsing this code when I call childThread.Join the whole application grinds to a halt which Id expect for the UI and thats fine and the childThread also seems to halt because the callback never gets hit again.p  pHowever, if I use the following code instead  p  precodepublic string GetSpecificInformation      This triggers InformationAcquiredCallback with a status of Cancelled     StopProcess      string s        ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemnew WaitCallbackdelegate              ifchildThread.IsAlive                      childThread.Join                  s  PInvokeMethods.GetSpecificInformation                       return s  codepre  pThen everything gets hit as expected and childThread does finish and all is well, except obviously my string gets returned empty before the WaitCallback fires and assigns to it.  p  pSo, do I just have to suck it up and change the class so that I use the QueueUserWorkItem and WaitCallback and fire an event to deal with my string returnbr Is there something daft Im doing in my first approach thats causing the childThread to block as wellbr Or is there another tactic or class entirely that I should be using, bearing in mind its .NET 3.5 Im onp

Negative 33380 pI want my c program compiled under GCC to have maximum alignment of 4 bytes of members of structures. I really can do this through pragma pack directive. However, its uncomfortable in my case because the project is quite big, and I would need to make a single header with pragma pack, that has to be included everywhere. Now, the gcc comiler has an option mstructuresizeboundaryn documented here a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccARMOptions.htmlARMOptions relnofollowhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccARMOptions.htmlARMOptionsa , it says Permissible values are 8, 32 and 64. In practice, when I try to set it to 4 bytes compiler throws a warning structure size boundary can only be set to 8, 32 or 64 surprising, eh. But why I CAN set it to 4 through pragma Does anybody know how to set gcc struct alignment to other values than 83264 through compiler settings p
Negative 33380 pIve got a bit of a problem with debugging a C program using GDB.p  pWhen I use codeprint object.membercode, it doesnt always print the value of the variable correctly.

I mean, not work.p  pSo all I can ask is, has anybody ever seen this behaviour in GDB, and have you found out what caused it and how to solve itp  pThere are question here about similar behaviour, but those amount to the program not being compiled properly optimisation levels too high etc. I compiled it with codeWall Wextra pedantic g O0code, so that cant be it.p  pAnd the program runs fine I can codecout ltlt object.membercode and that outputs the expected value, so I dont know what to try now.p

My thinking is there is a limit for embedded functions in depth but I am not able to verify this.p  precode.titleswordnthchild2.cssvisibility, visible.hide.fadeInfast.fadeOutfast, gt     .titleswordnthchild3.cssvisibility, visible.hide.fadeInfast, gt         .titleswordnthchild4.cssvisibility, visible.hide.fadeInfast.fadeOutfast, gt             .titleswordnthchild5.cssvisibility, visible.hide.fadeInfast, gt                 .titleswordnthchild6.cssvisibility, visible.hide.fadeInfast.fadeOutfast, gt                     .titleswordnthchild7.cssvisibility, visible.hide.fadeInfast, gt                         .titleswordnthchild8.cssvisibility, visible.hide.fadeInfast.fadeOutfast                                                                    codepre

If Im wrong on something, do let me know.p  pFrom a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7220404whatisthetrickwith0diplayoutheightorlayouthwidthWhat is the trick with 0dip layoutheight or layouthwidthap  pThere are 3 general layout attributes that work with emwidthem and emheightemp  ol licodeandroidlayoutheightcodeli licodeandroidlayoutwidthcodeli licodeandroidlayoutweightcodeli ol  pWhen a codeLinearLayoutcode is emverticalem, then the codelayoutweightcode will effect the emheightem of the child codeViewcodes codeListViewcode.

This is highlighted by emandroid developerem in an answer below.p  pAlso, emAndroid Lintem and emEclipseem both say to use code0dipcode. From that answer below, you can use code0dipcode, code0dpcode, code0pxcode, etc since a zero size is the same in any of the units.p  pstrongAvoid wrapcontent on ListViewstrongp  pFrom a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4270278layoutwidthofalistview42704714270471Layoutwidth of a ListViewap  pIf youve ever wondered why codegetView...code is called so many times like I have, it turns out to be related to codewrapcontentcode.p  pUsing codewrapcontentcode like I was using above will cause all child codeViewcodes to be measured which will cause further CPU time. This measurement will cause your codegetView...code to be called. Ive now tested this and the number of times codegetView...code is called is reduced dramatically.p  pWhen I was using codewrapcontentcode on two codeListViewcodes, codegetView...code was called 3 times for each row on one codeListViewcode and 4 times for each row on the other.p  pChanging this to the recommended code0dpcode, codegetView...code was called only once for each row. This is quite an improvement, but has more to do with avoiding codewrapcontentcode on a codeListViewcode than it does the code0dpcode.p  pHowever the suggestion of code0dpcode does substantially improve performance because of this.p

Negative 33380 pIm using pyodbc quite short period of time and now faced with the problem of applying sql script from file which performs some view creation. For applying sql file I use sample from another thread  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10387892followupexecutesqlfilesfrompythonFollow up Execute .sql files from pythona   Have no problems with majority of my sql scripts but this one causes a problemp  ppart of script p  precodeinsert into TMPVIEWS select  from TMPQUERYSQL go begin declare SQLCMD varchar4000 declare CNT int set CNT  select count1 from TMPVIEWS while CNT gt 0 begin    set SQLCMD  select top 1 SQLCMD from TMPVIEWS order by SQLCMD   print Executing   SQLCMD   EXECSQLCMD   delete from TMPVIEWS where SQLCMD  SQLCMD   set CNT  select count1 from TMPVIEWS end end codepre  pAs you see it performs execution of SQL statements that were inserted to table from another table. So in the way I apply it it doesnt work. Sample from another thread devides sql file into blocks between GO and applyes them. So insert into TMPVIEWS select  from TMPQUERYSQL applied separately and then other part. It looks like pyodbc or driver doesnt actually wait for full execution of insert on server and second block is executed before actuall insert is comlete. As a result I have quite random amount of views created and noncreted queries remained in TMPVIEWS. I have autocommit and tried to add additional commits after query execution  this doesnt help. The only thing that helps  add time.sleep0.2 beetween execution of this batches between GO. Looks like some asynchronuous call. Who faces with the same problem or what may be wrong in my attempt May be some workaroundp  pThanksp

Negative 33380 pAfter rethinking the design and with some input from paddy I came up with something like this,  but I wonder on the correctness of it, it seems fine when I run it... The idea is that preallocated objects inherit from the followingp  precodestruct Node      void pool  codepre  pThat way we inject in every allocated object a pointer to its pool for later releasing it. Then we havep  precodetemplateltclass T, int thesizegt struct MemPool      T getNext     void freeT ptr      struct ThreadLocalMemPool              T getNextTL         void freeTL          int size         vectorltTgt buffer         vectorltintgt freeList         int freeListIdx         int bufferIdx         ThreadLocalMemPool nextTlPool within a threads context a linked list           int size     threadlocal ThreadLocalMemPool tlPool one of these per thread  codepre  pSo basically I say codeMemPoolltCat, 100gtcode and it gives me a mempool which for every thread that codegetNextscode it, will instantiate a threadlocal mempool. Sizes I round internally to nearest power of two for easy modulo which for simplicity ill omit. Because codegetNextcode is local to each thread, it does not require locking, and I try to use atomics for the freeing part as followsp  precodeT ThreadLocalMemPoolgetNextTL      int iHead  bufferIdx  size     int iTail  freeListIdx  size      if iHead  iTail   If head reaches tail, the free list is empty.              int amp idx  freeList[iHead]         while idx  DIRTY          return buffer[idx]          else              bufferIdx we will recheck next time         if nextTLPool             return nextTLPoolgtgetNextTL         else             set nextTLPool to a new ThreadLocalMemPool and return getNextTL from it..        void ThreadLocalMemPoolfreeT ptr      the outer struct handles calling this in the right ThreadLocalMemPool      we compute the index in the pool from which this pool came from by subtracting from     its address the address of the first pointer in this guys buffer     int idx  computeAsInCommentptr      int oldListIdx  atomicincrementreturnsoldvaluefreeListIdx     freeList[oldListIdx  size]  idx  codepre  pNow, the idea is the codefreeListIdxcode will always trail behind the codebufferIdxcode in a pool because you cant I assume correct usage free more than you have allocated. Calls to free synchronize the order in which they are returning buffer indices to the free list and the getNext will pick up on this as it cycles back. I have been thinking about it for a bit and dont see anything semantically wrong  with the logic, does it seem sound or is there something subtle which could break itp

I created a new project to test if I messed up the original one, but still same problem. I also repeated the steps but I keep finding the source of the problem to be in the actual Map view in the objects folder for you to add to the storyboard.

Negative 33380 pI have 2 UIViewControllers in a storyboard.

Im using the GROUPCONCAT aggregate function. This delivers me all IPs of that group separated by ,. So I can search whether the one Im searching for already exists there. The only drawback of this is, that the default maximum lenght of this returned string is 1024. That means that I cant handle a big amount of users, but for now it should be fine.p

Negative 33380 pIm working on an angular app and am running into a problem. Im fairly new to JS and very new to asynch programming so Im guessing Im missing something obvious.p  pThe gist of the problem is that I have a for loop which builds an array. I then need to join that array as soon as the for loop has completed its business. Normally this would be a no brainer but apparently in angular the for loop executes asynchronously. I need to force my array join to happen emafterem the for loop exits. p  precodeifdata.results[i].isdeleted    var objectsOnCurrentPermission  new Array   ifdata.results[i].objects      forvar j  0 j lt data.results[i].objects.length j        var currentObjectId  data.results[i].objects[j].objectid       var currentObjectName       var objectData  Object.getid currentObjectId, functionobjectData          objectsOnCurrentPermission.pushobjectData.name         console.login loop in get fn         console.logobjectsOnCurrentPermission                 console.logafter loop     console.logobjectsOnCurrentPermission     var listOfObjectsOnCurrentPermission  objectsOnCurrentPermission.join,      console.logstr after assignment     console.loglistOfObjectsOnCurrentPermission     data.results[i][objectslist]  listOfObjectsOnCurrentPermission  codepre  pTo my surprise, when I inspect the output I see I added lts for readabilityp  precodeafter loop permissions.js246 gtArray[1] permissions.js247 str after assignment permissions.js249  permissions.js250 in loop in fn permissions.js242 gtArray[1] codepre  pYou can see that the after loop output executes first. From what I can tell, the first time it outputs Array[1] the array isnt actually populated  chrome just fills it in after the fact. The the blank line after the line that says str after assignment is where I try to output of the join which clearly didnt work. Then finally the code in the loop executes. As I mentioned I need to make sure that array join happens after the for loop has finished populating the array.p
Negative 33380 pI have a C class library project that is commonly used by other C projects.

I know what causes the problem and I understand it. Other projects using my class library project converts the MYLIBEXPORT keyword to declspecdllimport.

But, then the compiler sees the definition inside the header. p  pHow can I overcome this situation and be able to export my template classes that are defined inside my class library projectp

But the remaining 10 of the time I get a channel that is unusable. Having looked at this code for months, I strongly believe that this problem is not due to a logical error. By unusable channel I mean that even though the client connects to it successfully, the server is not able to message it. Most of the operations involved on the client and server complete successfullyp  ul liOn the server, I create a channel with a new client id unique to the sessionli liThe client fetches the corresponding token and connects to itli liOn the client, onOpen is called on the channel socketli ul  pThe one thing that doesnt succeed is the calling of ahchannelconnected for these defective channels.

Negative 33380 pHere is what I have I have a codeCcode class which contains codeDcode class with CORE data, a codeBcode class that inherits from codeCcode, and an codeAcode class that inherits from codeBcode, then I have a codeMcode class that contains codeAcode and a codeNcode class that contains codeBcode, so now the relationship is codeMAgtBgtCD NBgtCDcode. codeBcode contains various important data and thats set beforehead, codeBcode also contains codealphacode data that will be set laterp  pWhat Im trying to do is to relate codeAcode to codeBcode such that they reference the same object codeCcode which they both inherit from. codeNBgtCDcode is an existing relationship and cannot be modified, codeMcode is a existing class that can host codeBcode, so I created codeAcode inside codeMcode and type casting codeBcode to codeAcode codeBcode is the super class of codeAcode.

Also the memory adress of A and B are not the same anymore,  with slight difference codepre  pSo after set these data another class will perform a series of actions on codeBcode and output corresponding result on codeBcode, but since I have set the same reference for codeAcode so any change done to codeAcode will be reflected to codeBcode as well, and the output done to codeAcode will be the same as that of codeBcode. But the reality is no, there is only change on codeBcode but not codeAcode, after intensive debuggine I found that part of the data in codeAcode is not the same as that of codeBcode, even I have set them as the same. And more interstingly, both codeAcode and codeBcode and the same codemisc[]code dataSets which were added to codeBcode, but all data in codeDcode and the codealphacode data in codeBcode is only set in codeBcode object and appears uninitialized in codeAcode. In the code comment above I have show the exact line where the change happened, before which everything is good but right after that return line all data excepts codemisc[]code got poped out somehow which I have no clue why it happened. p  pThese are call by reference so I shouldnt have the problem of only modifying a local copy, plus why is codemisc[]code intact codeAcode and codeBcode are declared as actual data on stack in codeNcode and codeMcode not as pointers, codemisc[]code are as pointers and codeDcode are declared as actual data in codeCcode.p  pSo it seems all data thats declared directly on stack gets poped while the pointer one remain intact for codeAcode.

Does this code exhibit undefined behaviourp  precodeint main      int a, b  uninitialised      memcpyampa, ampb, sizeofint  codepre  pI would usually say yes, because causing an lvaluetorvalue conversion of an uninitialised object is UB, something which must be done to copy the bytes of codebcode to codeacode.p  pHowever, codememcpycode may or may not be implemented in C. If codememcpycode is written in assembly for example, then there are no such rules. Do programs that do things that would normally cause undefined behaviour still cause it if they outsource the offending operations to other languages with dissimilar rulesp

Negative 33380 pI am trying to evaluate a function that I have defined piecewise. I need to integrate it with respect to one variable and then take the derivative with respect to another variables are independent. However, something in the way I am defining the functions is causing mathematica to throw errors or infinitely evaluate. I believe that the derivative function does not like the format of the output of the integrate function, and vice versa when I tired reversing the order of the steps. The integrand is not analytical by hand, so I need to pipe the output of one into the other.

Negative 33380 pRegarding source maps, I came across a strange behavior in chromium build 181620. In my app Im using minified jquery and after loggingin, I started seeing HTTP requests for jquery.min.map in server log file. Those requests were lacking cookie headers all other requests were fine. Those requests are not even exposed in net tab in Developer tools which doesnt bug me that much.p  pThe point is, js files in this app are only supposed to be available to loggedin clients, so in this setup, the source maps either wont work or Id have to change the location of source map to a public directory.p  pMy question is is this a desired behavior meaning  source map requests should not send cookies or is it a bug in Chromiump

I had moved the site to the new dev server Windows 2008 so long ago. I had made notes so when I moved it up to production I knew what steps I had taken. I thought perhaps I forgot to record a step so in attempt to retrace what I did, I uninstalled the .dll and went through the steps I had recorded. It is now broken in dev but at one point it was working. p  pAnother thing Im not sure is worth mentioning is this site was the first site on the new dev server. .NET 1.1 was installed prior to any other framework. 4.0 and 2.0 were installed after the fact. On the prod server 4.0 was installed first and then 1.1.

Negative 33380 pIm in the process of developing an application which reads data from a DAQ that streams its data over Bluetooth. The packet sizes can change, as can the sampling rate 1Hz  512Hz, and Im able to loop through and read the data off the device using a buffer.p  pMy question is, how do I correctly process the data when there is such a variable of packet size and sampling rate How do I determine the buffer size p  pCurrently Im simply opening a socket, opening an input stream, and then using a while loop while the socket is open  true to read from the stream, and process the data simple decoding, not an extraneous task.p  pAs an example, there are 23 bytes in a packet, and I have the sampling rate very low at the moment at 1Hz. I have a buffer of 256 bytes, which means that it wont accommodate a full packet at the end of the buffer, and Ive written code for it to run over onto the next buffer. Once the data is read grab one packet from the buffer, decode and store it, do the next one, etc.p  pHow should I be streaming, and manipulating the data correctly Eventually Ill be grabbing something in the region of 44 packets at 512Hz, right at Bluetooths transfer limit, and I want to be able to process it as effective as possible, and display errors when a packet is dropped in the process, etc. p  pTLDR how do I correctly stream data using buffers andor interrupts.p

Negative 33380 pI posted this on matlab central but didnt get any responses so I figured Id repost here. p  pI recently wrote a simple routine in Matlab that uses an FFT in a forloop the FFT dominates the calculations. I wrote the same routine in mex just for experimentation purposes and it calls the FFTW 3.3 library. It turns out that the matlab routine runs faster than the mex routine for very large arrays about twice as fast. The mex routine uses wisdom and and performs the same FFT calculations. I also know matlab uses FFTW, but is it possible their version is slightly more optimized I even used the FFTWEXHAUSTIVE flag and its still about twice as slow for large arrays than the MATLAB counterpart. Furthermore I ensured the matlab I used was single threaded with the singleCompThread flag and the mex file I used was not in debug mode. Just curious if this was the case  or if there are some optimizations matlab is using under the hood that I dont know about.

Negative 33380 pI am trying to learn how TCP Flow Control works when I came across the concept of receive window.p  pMy question is, why is the TCP receive window scaleable Are there any advantages from implementing a small receive window sizep  pBecause as I understand it, the larger the receive window size, the higher the throughput. While the smaller the receive window, the lower the throughput, since TCP will always wait until the allocated buffer is not full before sending more data. So doesnt it make sense to have the receive window at the maximum at all times to have maximum transfer ratep

Negative 33380 pIm trying to use dragAndDrop in the Firefox selenium IDE but its not working.p  pIm a big fan of selenium but this problem has been driving me crazy for the last day.p  pI have a dragAndDrop testp  precodedragAndDrop div[containstext,Lori F.].... 0,160 codepre  pbut it doesnt do the drag and drop.  I have seen it work a couple of times but not sure why  why not now.  Seems to sometimes work and sometimes not. p  pThe selector itself DOES works when I click on the IDE [find] button.  It highlights the codeDIVcode I am trying to move.  So this is not the usual problem I have in selenium of not actually being able to select the object with the right xpath.p  pThe HTML it is going against isp  precodeltdiv classfceventinner fceventskin stylebackgroundcolor yellowgt   ltdiv classfceventhead fceventskingtltdivgt   ltdiv classgt     ltdiv classfceventtitlegt       Lori F., Marshal H., Chris W., Kenna T.     ltdivgt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classfceventbggtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pWhen that actual step tries to run, the browser does actually flash the object, indicating that its able to select it via the path OK, but the drag and drop doesnt happen.p  pI have tried dragAndDropToObject, using a div, but this didnt work because the DIV itself needs an x,y coordinate in order to land on the right spot.p  pTwo problems I have found [this may help other people]  and eliminated  were that 1 zooming inout on the screen messed up the x,y coordinate for the drop, so I stopped doing that and 2 Using the element inspector in firefox seemed to also stop it working.  So I believe Ive eliminated both of these as potential causes.p  pBeing able to test draganddrop is pretty important as many applications are now taking various ajax routes with this kinda stuff so being able to test it is keyp

Negative 33380 pOkay, so lets say I have two tables, TableA and TableB. In Table A I have a column C, and in Table B I have a column D and a column E.p  pTableA contains a lot of rows that can contain the same value in column C. TableB contains a lot of rows, but column D has to be unique its the autoincrement number. TableBs column E also can contain the same value in different rows. As well, column C and column D will contain the same numbers.p  pExample Tablesp  precodeTableA  ID     C  1      1 2      1 3      2  TableB  D    E  1    1 2    0 3    0 codepre  pNow, what I want to do is count all the rows in TableA in column C, which I have figured out how to do. However, I additionally want it to only give me as a result the count of C where the equivalent value in D also has an E of 1.p  pSo, I have tried this, but it is failing and I cannot think of what Im doing wrong or how to fix it. Googling for COUNT only gets me results dealing with one table.p  pIn my example, I want it to COUNT C where the ID number that matches in TableB column D where E  1 so, where TableB column D  1, and return that as the count, so I want it to return to me or something to this effectp  pc   COUNT Descending 1   2p  precodeSELECT TableA.C, COUNT FROM TableA, TableB WHERE TableB.E  1 GROUP BY TableA.C ORDER BY COUNT DESC codepre  pIf that makes any sense...p

The only problem is that the loop never recognizes the date despite the formats being exactly the same. I tried changing CurrentD to a number and then entering that number into the spreadsheet. When I run the macro in this case it will stop on that number, but for some reason when slashes are involved it wont recognize the cell value and continues looping.

Negative 33380 pIve been struggling with learning the AMD based Dojo build system. So far I havent been able to get a build that is usable without getting load errors in the browser FF.p  pI have questions about how to manage the build.p  pMy build profile file has a packages section. What I specify there seems to directly correlate to those same package directories being written into the destination directory. This seems appropriate. However, I also have a layers section that is trying to merge just the referenced modules from dojo, dijit, dojox, etc. When they get combined into one dojo.js file, I still have all those library directories in my destination dir. Is it understood that you just manually go in and remove them or is there an automatic way to get them removed during the buildp  pIn my first layer I try to build it for dojo, dijit and dojoxappmain.  This is not pulling over any resources, such as dojoresourcesblank.gif or any .css files in that same directory. How does one get those resource files to copy over to the destination I believe dojo.profile.js which does indicate to copy those resources only impacts the dojo directory. But since I am creating a custom dojodijitdojox file that combines js modules, there is no resources directory. After the custom build, am I supposed to manually go into the dojo directory and move the dojoresources dir out but toss the rest of the dojo dir Just not sure how to get the dependent img and css files accessible in the dojo dir for use with the custom dojo.js layer file when a dojodijit layer is built.p  pHeres my build profilep  pre classlangjavascript prettyprintoverridecodevar profile       basePath .,     releaseDir irbrelease,     action release,     cssOptimize comments,     stripConsole all,     selectorEngine acme,     layerOptimize closure,     optimize closure,     mini true,     packages[              name dojo,         location ..libsdojo ,              name dijit,        location ..libsdijit ,              name dojox,        location ..libsdojox ,              name dgrid,        location ..libsdgrid ,              name putselector, location ..libsputselector ,              name xstyle,       location ..libsxstyle ,              name myPkg,     location ..libsmyPkg ,              name irb,          location ..irb      ],     layers              releaseirblibsdojo                      include [dojodojo, dijitdijit, dojoxappmain],                     boot true,                     customBase true             ,             releaseirblibsmyPkg                      include [                             myPkgdialogMessageBox,                             myPkggridsFilterGrid,                             myPkgutilWidgetMonitor,                             myPkgcontrollersBorderLayout,                             myPkgcontrollersUnloadViewController                      ],                     includeLocales [ enus ]             ,             releaseirblibsstoreMemory                      include [ dojostoreMemory ]             ,             releaseirblibsstoreObservable                      include [ dojostoreObservable ]             ,             irbirb                      include [                             irbirb,                             dojoxappView,                             dojoxcss3transit,                             dojoxappcontrollersLoad,                             dojoxappcontrollersTransition,                             dojoxappcontrollersHistory                     ]                  ,      staticHasFeatures               The trace amp log APIs are used for debugging the loader, so we do not need them in the build.             dojotraceapi 0,             dojologapi 0,               This causes normally private loader data to be exposed for debugging.

Further I am not implying that Google Play App is using Nostra 13 Universal Image Loader.I am interested on how to achieve this behavior using Universal Image Loader Library img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5OHlw.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHm7SX.png altenter image description herep  pSo my question is how to achieve that using UIL. Meaning once the image has been downloaded and cached,what should I do properly to configure UIL to show cached images without any loading screen. Once I scroll down and up after image has been dowloaded, the image be properly loaded without any loading screen.

Negative 33380 pI have troubles with multiple threads. Here is the situationp  pI make asynchronous requests to backend and, in some cases, need to cancel these. Canceling the requests happens in a separate thread. All requests to the backend are canceled and, as I exit a screen, multiple class instances are deallocated. p  pWhen I have the order requestcancel, everything works fine. However, sometimes the cancel method is invoked when I am already in the middle of the finish method which needs a little bit time because of decoding and conversion of data. In such cases, the app crashes, a messages to deallocated instance is sent. It is not an exception that can be easily cached, I get the crash even when I check for the existence of the instances a line before. Actually, if I understand it right, the instance of the class where the finish and the cancel method are located, is deallocated. Nevermind, the problem is that the thread is switched in the middle of the finish method and I need to prevent that.p  pMy question is Is there a way to block switching the thread in the middle of a method To declare this method as a whole transaction Or is there another standard solution for such a problemp  pI read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16131591iosthreadsafetycompleteablockofcodebeforethreadswitchesthis posta but I dont really understand whether it can be used in my case or how to do that.p  pstrongEDIT Cancelingstrongp  precodefor XXX request in [XXX sharedQueue].operations      [request setDelegatenil]     [request setDownloadProgressDelegatenil]     [request setUploadProgressDelegatenil]     [request setQueuenil]     [request cancel]  codepre  pcodeXXXcode is the class used for the requests.p  pstrongOrder of the methodsstrongp  pHere is the order in which the methods are invoked in the cases of error. codeHandlercode is the class for handling the requests.p  precodeHandler 1 make request Handler 1 finish begin Handler 2 cancel begin Handler 2 cancel end Handler 2 dealloc Handler 1 dealloc Handler 1 finish middle codepre  pHandler 1 and 2 are two instances of the class. The first one is deallocated in the middle of the finish method, so at the end of this I get a crash. Deallocating it is normal because after cancel I go to another view and basically everything gets deallocated. p  pMy ideas for solution are either to somehow prevent going back to the finish method or to execute the entire finish method before switching the thread. Unfortunately, I have no idea how one of these could be implemented.p

Negative 33380 pApart from the agile.properties file, where else do I have to update the DB password string for Agile  Still getting ORA01017.p  pI did a grep, the other files that have the string are installbintokens.txt and uninstallerinstallvariables.properties, but dont think they matter unless Im gonna uninstallp
Negative 33380 pI am currently working on a simple php websitep  pThe problem is , the images in my whole web sitehappens in all php files randomly corrupt and show the error strongResource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type texthtmlstrong, however, if I try to refresh the page several times. The image can be loaded again and the error is gone. p  pI have checked all img path and the image is exist. Also, I checked there is no codeimg srccode in my file. Is it due to server setting I check .htaccess file and it is blank. How to fix the problem  Thanksp

Negative 33380 pI am experimenting trying to find the best and most efficient way to alter the data in a given table through a form using PHP.p  pThe scenario is a list of items in a table, if you right clickedit an item, a request is made to MySQL for all the data and the fields are populated.p  pThe user can change or leave the data untouched in any of the fields, and then presses save which sends everything back to PHP.p  pThe easy way would be to just update all the columns regardless of whether or not they have changed, i.e.p  precodethisgtmodelgtsetname, some name string from the form, itemId thisgtmodelgtsetprice, number from the form, itemId ...etc... codepre  pSo potentially I could change just the name and needlessly update the rest of the columns with the same data as what was received. As a side question, does MySQL know this and ignore the update behind the scenesp  pWould a good way to perform an intelligent update be to compare two arrays One that contains the original data and another with the data from the user.

Negative 33380 pWe have a webapp which uses federated authentication to authenticate users. Data for the Fed Auth are obtained from the Active Directory service.p  pOne of the systems requirements is to have a Last log in date saved in the webapp, but the application is not performing any log in operation. It just checks if the incoming request if allowed to perform requested operation, based on the AD credentials.p  pHave you ever encountered such a requirement in a similar scenario What was your approach to the problem We thought about creating user session on the first request and treat the session creation point as the log in date. This seemed as a bad idea, as we dont want to use usersession at all, and it would be the only scenario utilizing it.p  pAnother approach we were thinking about was to use client to tell us if he is logging in or not, for example by making a special mock request, which on the webapp would be treated as the log in. This also seems bad, because in that case we have to trust the client to be telling the truth, which basically looks like a major vulnerability.p  pI am aware that this requirement makes little sense in such environment, but that is something I cant argue with right now, thats why I am trying to find most reasonable solution to that situation.p  pThanks for all the suggestions in advance.p

Negative 33380 h2Preambleh2  pMy current employer is leaning towards the revamp of our outdated codebase we still have some .NET 2.0 code up and running but starting to suffer from deprecation, and as part of this effort our team is choosing some technologies and practices to adopt as our base framework for new and updated applications  and quite a few deal with the UI, such as a hrefhttpthreejs.org relnofollowthree.jsa, a hrefhttpd3js.org relnofollowD3jsa we have our healthy share of data visualization, semantics and websockets the latter brought us to a hrefhttpsignalr.net relnofollowSignalRa.p  pWhile researching the way SignalR is implemented and websockets in general, I reached a point where I wanted to check if multicastlike communication would be viable. In simple terms, a multicast is similar to a broadcast in the sense that you can send a single packet simultaneously to several clients  difference being that you may control how many clients are part of the whole exchange, by having them join a given multicast group.p  pMulticast is a very neat technology if you want to save bandwidth  and, I imagine, processor time in SignalRs case.p  pSo far, all implementations of multicastlike behavior using SignalR that Ive managed to check kind of behaves the same way, iterating through all preestablished connections. Ive also checked the documentation, but nothing noteworthy came up so far.p  pThat said,p  h2Questionh2  pIs SignalR compatible with TCP Multicast Have anyone implemented a similar scenariop

I thought of creating another set of icon pictures that were grey and transitions them on hover, but the only way to do that would be to rewrite the bulk of the menu since there all set as imgs and not backgrounds to divs that I can change with css.

So it seems you have to abandon makeshared and call new explicitly.p  precodestdsharedptrltFoogt pfnewstdnothrow Foo1, 2, 3 codepre  pThis eliminates the optimization of allocating the control block with the Foo, and the control block allocation could fail independently of the Foo allocation, but I dont want to focus on that.

The javascript I am using was from a sample that displayed the data in a web browser, and I am trying to modify it so I can bind relevant pieces into textblocks using C.p  pMainPage.xamlp  precodeltphoneWebBrowser xNameBrowser VisibilityCollapsed                       IsScriptEnabledTrue                       LoadedBrowserLoaded                       NavigatedBrowserNavigated                       NavigationFailedBrowserNavigationFailed                                                 ScriptNotifyBrowserScriptNotifygt codepre  pMainPage.xaml.csp  precodeprivate string MainUri  Htmlindex.html  private void BrowserLoadedobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              tell the browser the URL to navigate to         Browser.Navigatenew UriMainUri, UriKind.Relative       private void BrowserScriptNotifyobject sender, NotifyEventArgs e              TestResultTextBlock.Text  e.Value.ToString       When textblock is tapped, run the javascript function. private void CheckTextBlockTapobject sender, System.Windows.Input.GestureEventArgs e               object result1  Browser.InvokeScriptprintIt                              codepre  pindex.html which holds the javascriptp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtlttitlegt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function printIt           show page load performance  show a few important bits, not everything         var performanceHTML           if featureDetect.supported              if featureDetect.unprefixed                  var t  window.performance.timing              else if featureDetect.prefixed  ms                  var t  window.msPerformance.timing              else if featureDetect.prefixed  webkit                  var t  window.webkitPerformance.timing              else                  alertUnexpected error while fetching navigation timing data.                 return                           var start  t.navigationStart             var sortable  []             var maxTime  0             var order  [navigationStart, redirectStart, redirectEnd,               fetchStart, domainLookupStart, domainLookupEnd, connectStart,               secureConnectionStart, connectEnd, requestStart, responseStart,               responseEnd, unloadEventStart, unloadEventEnd, domLoading, domInteractive,               msFirstPaint, domContentLoadedEventStart, domContentLoadedEventEnd,               domContentLoaded, domComplete, loadEventStart, loadEventEnd]              var perfEvents  Object.keyst.length  Object.keyst  Object.keysObject.getPrototypeOft             perfEvents.forEachfunction e                  if t[e] ampamp t[e] gt 0                      duration  t[e]  start                     sortable.push[e, duration]                     if duration gt maxTime                          maxTime  duration                                                                sortable.sortfunction a, b                  return a[1]  b[1]  a[1]  b[1]  order.indexOfa[0]  order.indexOfb[0]                            If you wanted to log the data to the console, sortable is what you want              console.logsortable.toString               wrapping in a table simply for layout reasons             performanceHTML  lttablegtlttheadgtlttrgtltth scopecol idxyzgtPropertyltthgtltth scopecol idxyzgtValueltthgtlttrgt             sortable.forEachfunction s                  performanceHTML  performanceHTML  lttrgtlttdgt  s[0]  lttdgtlttdgt  s[1]  mslttdgt                          performanceHTML  performanceHTML  lttablegt                   document.getElementByIdperformancediv.innerHTML  performanceHTML         document.getElementByIdperformancediv.style.visibility  visible      ltscriptgt codepre  p   p  pMind you I am very new HTMLJavaScript and this is my first app using it.

Negative 33380 pI want to retrieve specific businesses in Turkey, e.g Flower shop in Istanbul, Turkey I have gone through dozens of API but all of them have restriction on the number of result records to be retrieved. Like google has 60 with 3 pages of 20 records, bing has 250 25 record per page, Yelp has 40 and so every API has the data limit. I am interested in bing or google for the result records, is there any way we can retrieve 05000 or max records either by paging or any way. Do they provide any subscriptioncharges for that, i cannot find they do this even someone is ready to pay it.p  pThanksp

Negative 33380 pI am trying to create on the server side certificates for my website users so they could authenticate themselves, instead of the basic authentication I already offer which is usernamepassword.p  pCan I do the whole process of generating the publicprivate keys for creating the CSR, on the server side instead of on the client sidep  pI was thinking of the following processp  pThe user logs into the website and authenticate themselves by usernamepassword.p  pThe user will submit identifying details through a web form over SSL connection between the user browser and the server.p  pThen the server will create the publicprivate keys for that user, and use these to create the CSR on the server. Then the server will use the CSR to create the certificate for the user. Then it will send the certificate to the user over SSL. Then the server will erase the created publicprivate keys.p  pFinally, the user will install the certificate on their browser.p  pIs this going to work Is it unsafe in some way Is it okay to move like that from the client side to the server side the responsibility of creating the publicprivate keys for creating the CSR Will this make the created certificate less useful in some way for the userp

Negative 33380 pIm running into some strange problems with using BeautifulSoup for editing XML. After I read in the XML file and make all of my edits, I write it to a file usingp  precodeoutput  openoutput.xml, r output.writestrsoup output.close codepre  pHowever, the program that needs to read in this XML file does not even recognize it exists its supposed to automatically load XML. For any reference this is ArcGis. I can open up the original XML and the Pythongenerated one and verify that they are completely identicalat least visually.p  pAnother quirky behavior is that if I open the original XML file and make edits to it with a text editor and save, there is no error with the program and it loads correctly. If I make edits using Python but NOT with BeautifulSoup i.e. string operations it also works fine. it seems that writing the output string with BeautifulSoup causes the problem.p  pIs this some kind of encoding issue Whats the difference between a string obtained from the BeautifulSoup object and a normal string read straight from a filep
Negative 33380 pI have a really basic ncurses program to monitor machine statistics and launch remote xterms.  It just sits on a window all day and helps me choose a notheavilyloaded machine to work on.  It works fine, and I love it dearly.  But its really fat.  Much fatter than it needs to be, I think.p  pThe program basically is as followsp  precodevoid  runvoid  task       once per minute         popen  stats checking command            save output to global var         pclose   int main       setup ncurses with halfdelay     for   each machine            pthreadcreatesomethread, NULL, run, void somestruct     while   c  getch   q          for   each machine                 print machine stats          maybe launch an xterm      die gracefully  codepre  pAnd as stated above, it works just fine.  The problem is that each thread has all the ncurses baloney tucked in private memory leading to one very fat process with a boatload of wasted bits.p  pThe question, then, is this  how can I rewrite or rearrange this program so that each pthread doesnt carry around all the unnecessary ncurses stuffp  pSidequestion Youll have to really sell me on it, but does anyone know of a better method than ncurses to do this  I want the stats on fixed positions in the terminal window, not scrolling text.p

Is that possibile I tried to use the keyword me in my api call but I think that is not the right route since what the api call returns is only my email and all the other field are blank I know that they are all filled in in my profile. Is this because I am on the dev server p  pHere is my function to retrieve the user profilep  precodeprivate Person retrieveUserInfoUser user throws IOException, GeneralSecurityException      Set up the HTTP transport and JSON factory     HttpTransport httpTransport  GoogleNetHttpTransport.newTrustedTransport     JacksonFactory jsonFactory  JacksonFactory.getDefaultInstance      GoogleCredential credential  new GoogleCredential.Builder.setTransporthttpTransport             .setJsonFactoryjsonFactory             .setServiceAccountId146433070678dpj18aug5amtqqfqcnmnco4lne91uii5developer.gserviceaccount.com             .setServiceAccountScopesCollections.singletonPlusScopes.USERINFOPROFILE             .setServiceAccountPrivateKeyFromP12Filenew Filesecretkey.p12             .build        Set up the main Google class     Plus plus  new Plus.BuilderhttpTransport, jsonFactory, credential         .setApplicationNamenoappid         .build       Make a request to access your profile and display it to console     Person profile  plus.people.getme.execute     return profile  codepre  pI would appreciate any hints about accessing user details from a GAE backend.

Negative 33380 pI have a couple different enemy types and enemyManager arrayList classes for each type. I have each type of enemy randomly spawning at spawn points slightly off screen, coming onto the screen, then off the other side, dying, and randomly responding.

I would like to have a delay between them so they are more spread out. p  pWhat I am looking for is a way to slow down the looped spawning of enemies in java. I tried extending enemy manager classes by timer and naming the spawn function run but this didnt work.p  pAlso I am not multithreading because I dont really know how to set that up yet and was trying to finish this project without implementing that, but if that seems like the best solution then I guess I will have to.p  pthanks for any suggestions. p  pupdated .....p  precodeclass spawnLgCars extends TimerTask      public void run          if lgCars.size lt 10              lgCars.addnew LgCar             System.out.printlnspawned          else if lgCars.size gt 10              lgCars.get0                 codepre  pHere I how Id like to implement TimerTask, but because it had to be in its own class it didnt have access to the properties of the instance of lgCars I was using.

Negative 33380 pThe TLDR version, for those who dont want the background, is the following specific questionp  h1Questionh1  blockquote   pWhy doesnt Java have an implementation of true multidimensional arrays Is there a solid technical reason What am I missing herep blockquote  h1Backgroundh1  pJava has multidimensional arrays at the syntax level, in that one can declarep  precodeint[][] arr  new int[10][10] codepre  pbut it seems that this is really not what one might have expected. Rather than having the JVM allocate a contiguous block of RAM big enough to store 100 codeintcodes, it comes out as an array of arrays of codeintcodes so each layer is a contiguous block of RAM, but the thing as a whole is not. Accessing codearr[i][j]code is thus rather slow the JVM has top  ol lifind the codeint[]code stored at codearr[i]codeli liindex this to find the codeintcode stored at codearr[i][j]code.li ol  pThis involves querying an object to go from one layer to the next, which is rather expensive.p  h1Why Java does thish1  pAt one level, its not hard to see why this cant be optimised to a simple scaleandadd lookup even if it were all allocated in one fixed block. The problem is that codearr[3]code is a reference all of its own, and it can be changed. So although arrays are of fixed size, we could easily writep  precodearr[3]  new int[11] codepre  pand now the scaleandadd is screwed because this layer has grown. Youd need to know at runtime whether everything is still the same size as it used to be. In addition, of course, this will then get allocated somewhere else in RAM itll have to be, since its bigger than what its replacing, so its not even in the right place for scaleandadd.p  h1Whats problematic about ith1  pIt seems to me that this is not ideal, and that for two reasons.p  pFor one, its emslowem. A test I ran with these methods for summing the contents of a single dimensional or multidimensional array took emnearly twice as longem 714 seconds vs 371 seconds for the multidimensional case an codeint[1000000]code and an codeint[100][100][100]code respectively, filled with random codeintcode values, run 1000000 times with warm cache.p  precodepublic static long sumSingleint[] arr      long total  0     for int i0 iltarr.length i         totalarr[i]     return total   public static long sumMultiint[][][] arr      long total  0     for int i0 iltarr.length i         for int j0 jltarr[0].length j             for int k0 kltarr[0][0].length k                 totalarr[i][j][k]     return total     codepre  pSecondly, because its slow, it thereby emencourages obscure codingem. If you encounter something performancecritical that would be naturally done with a multidimensional array, you have an incentive to write it as a flat array, even if that makes the unnatural and hard to read. Youre left with an unpalatable choice obscure code or slow code.p  h1What could be done about ith1  pIt seems to me that the basic problem could easily enough be fixed. The only reason, as we saw earlier, that it cant be optimised is that the structure might change. But Java already has a mechanism for making references unchangeable declare them as codefinalcode.p  pNow, just declaring it withp  precodefinal int[][] arr  new int[10][10] codepre  pisnt good enough because its only codearrcode that is codefinalcode here codearr[3]code still isnt, and could be changed, so the structure might still change. But if we had a way of declaring things so that it was codefinalcode throughout, except at the bottom layer where the codeintcode values are stored, then wed have an entire immutable structure, and it could all be allocated as one block, and indexed with scaleandadd.p  pHow it would look syntactically, Im not sure Im not a language designer. Maybep  precodefinal int[final][] arr  new int[10][10] codepre  palthough admittedly that looks a bit weird. This would mean codefinalcode at the top layer codefinalcode at the next layer not codefinalcode at the bottom layer else the codeintcode values themselves would be immutable.p  pFinality throughout would enable the JIT compiler to optimise this to give performance to that of a single dimensional array, which would then take away the temptation to code that way just to get round the slowness of multidimensional arrays.p  pI hear a rumour that C does something like this, although I also hear another rumour that the CLR implementation is so bad that its not worth having... perhaps theyre just rumours...p  h1Questionh1  blockquote   pSo why doesnt Java have an implementation of true multidimensional arrays Is there a solid technical reason What am I missing herep blockquote  h1Updateh1  pA bizarre side note the difference in timings drops away to only a few percent if you use an codeintcode for the running total rather than a codelongcode. Why would there be such a small difference with an codeintcode, and such a big difference with a codelongcodep  h3Benchmarking codeh3  pCode I used for benchmarking, in case anyone wants to try to reproduce these resultsp  precodepublic class Multidimensional       public static long sumSinglefinal int[] arr          long total  0         for int i0 iltarr.length i             totalarr[i]         return total           public static long sumMultifinal int[][][] arr          long total  0         for int i0 iltarr.length i             for int j0 jltarr[0].length j                 for int k0 kltarr[0][0].length k                     totalarr[i][j][k]         return total              public static void mainString[] args          final int iterations  1000000          Random r  new Random         int[] arr  new int[1000000]         for int i0 iltarr.length i             arr[i]r.nextInt         long total  0         System.out.printlnsumSinglearr         long time  System.nanoTime         for int i0 iltiterations i             total  sumSinglearr         time  System.nanoTimetime         System.out.printfTook d ms for single dimensionn, time1000000, total          int[][][] arrMulti  new int[100][100][100]         for int i0 iltarrMulti.length i             for int j0 jltarrMulti[i].length j                 for int k0 kltarrMulti[i][j].length k                     arrMulti[i][j][k]r.nextInt         System.out.printlnsumMultiarrMulti         time  System.nanoTime         for int i0 iltiterations i             total  sumMultiarrMulti         time  System.nanoTimetime         System.out.printfTook d ms for multi dimensionn, time1000000, total        codepre

So it looks like that it is unrelated to our MTA. We are using a hrefhttpwww.postfix.org relnofollowPostfixa on a a hrefhttpswww.debian.org relnofollowDebiana system. PHP is configured to use codeusrsbinsendmail t icode to send mails. This is the Postfix to Sendmail compatibility interface. I do not yet see any difference with the scripts where mails are sent correctly and the scripts where mail headers get corrupted. Also copying working code to a new file in the same directory leads to corrupted mails being sent, so I dont think that the PHP code is the source of the problem either. File encoding and line endings of working scripts and broken scripts is identical, too.p  pAny thoughts on what else might cause such a behaviorp

Negative 33380 pThe Web site angloinfo.com organises its information by using subdomains for the various countries of the world. For example, the Argentina section is found at argentina.angloinfo.com. Behind the scenes, are they likely using a single platform e.g. a CMS for all countries, and then publishing across their subdomains, respectively  presumably using some form of serverside URL manipulationmasking based on the subdomain part Why not use a structure like angloinfo.comargentina...  Alternatively, do they host the various country versions of the site in independent CMS systems in their respective countriesp

Automatically on page load this unblocks the ui.p  pthis blockui perfectly fulfilling my requirement. But every where this blockui getting used with Ajax calls not with regular form submit so i wonder whether it can be also used with regualr form submit too or not or if there is any other simple solution to block the ui as Im not using Ajaxand is this dowloaded blockui javascript file is safe to use as Im working for the federal companyp

Negative 33380 pI am trying to create a set of 320 matrices, each having dimensions 1152 x 241.  Each matrix represents a different time step.  I am trying to populate each cell, using a random value from another file.  This other file is also dimensioned 1152 x 241, but there are 2520 time steps from which to choose.p  pSo what is supposed to happen is pick a cell, populate with a value from a random time step from the big file, and move onto the adjacent cell and do the same thing.  Repeat until 320 matrices have been created.p  pProblem is I run the code and I only create one matrix.

Negative 33380 pThe new HTML5 input types and attributes, ie codetelcode, codeemailcode, codepatterncode, etc are useful for indicating to an unobtrusive javascript validator what rules should be applied to a given field.p  pIn some cases though, a specific field type which isnt in the spec needs a special algorithm. For example, codeinput typecreditcardcode would cause the validator to use a modulo10 algorithm, which pattern matching cant validate.p  pThe new input types work because old browsers fallback to codetypetextcode when it doesnt understand the type specified. From what I can tell, new browsers seem to follow this convention as well.p  pSince there is already a codetypecode attribute which is semantically correct, it seems messy and inconsistent to use a separate codedatatypecode attribute some of the time and the official codetypecode attribute when the needed type already exists.p  pI understand that some day there could be a type with the same name, but if the W3C adds an codeinput typecreditcardcode at some point in the future, what are the odds it would do something other than validate a credit card Or in other words, so long as the types are named well, the only conflict would be what was intended anyway.p  pAre there any pitfalls to simply making up new input types as I need themp

Negative 33380 pWhat I am trying to do is poll a database for updates, in this case if a new message is inserted into the message table. I am useing Server Sent Events that accesses a php script that identifies any new inputs on the message table, then it would be returned to the client page either as data or as a json object array. when the client gets the responce which will include 2 sets of data, the key and the value which in this case would be a auto incremented id and a randomly created message id so that the client can identify a new message and then pass the message id so that the content of the message can be displayed in a phone app. So far i have the sse actioning the php processing page, doing the db query and then encoding that data into a json object with the two elements queried. I can see this data responce in the web console, so am confident I have gone on the right route so far, Now im stuck on how to access the json object so I can create the variable to another function that will call for the message content to display.

Negative 33380 pI have been using SQL Report Builder 3.0 and Reporting Services to publish reports for the last 8 months. Still somewhat of a novice but slowly figuring out how to work with this amazing toolset more efficiently. I have started using parameter driven reports and all going well. However one question that I am struggling to get answer for is whether it is possible to use a single .rdl file and then use parameters to generate the required reports at runtime.p  pCurrently, I have a setup a .rdl file that uses parameters and an existing stored procedure via data source to feed data to the report. What I do each time is open the .rdl and save it as a report with a new parameter. This means that if I need to make a change to the report in any way, then I have to redo the setup for each report. It feels that this is very inefficient and was wondering if there is a way to reuse a single .rdl file and setup up multiple runtime reports off this single .rdl filep  pAny guidance would be hugely appreciated.p  pUpdate Just to clarify further. The report is used to report on client transactional data. So each time a new client is added to the business I create a new RDL for that specific client. Exactly the same RDL file but saved as a new name, and with a new parameter being the Client codep

Negative 33380 pMy app uses an NTP server to get a more precise time than the iOS system clock. However, a poster at a hrefhttpwatch.camp201411applewatchtimekeepingaccuracy relnofollowhttpwatch.camp201411applewatchtimekeepingaccuracya suggests that with iOS 8.2, the iOS system clock is much more accurate because its used to keep the Apple Watch within 50ms of true time. Can I therefore not bother to use an NTP server if the iOS version is 8.2 or greater Thoughtsp

Negative 33380 pI have an html page with a TinyMCE editor in it. In the editor I would like to edit HTML code that I get from external source. Some of the HTML I want to edit are problematic, for example I had one code with an unclosed div. What happens in that case, is that the rest of the HTML after the TinyMCE editing part gets messed up  because the rest of the HTML is not parsed properly, and thats understood.p  pThe question is how to solve this issue.p  pApproach 1  Is to try and solve it on the server side. Thats problematic, because I dont want to actually touchmodify that HTML source, the editing process that I need the Tinymce for is just for language changes by the editor. If Id implement some HTML fixing mechanism on the server side, I might end up with automatic changes to the HTML I didnt plan to.p  pApproach 2  If I had some  tag in HTML  that would be great  and tag in which the html code in it does not effect the outside code. Do I have that kind of tagp  pApproach 3  Is to think of putting the HTML code inside an inline IFRAME. The problem here is that my control buttons for SUBMIT are outside of the IFRAME  and the TinyMCE is in the IFRAME, so how would I do the Javascript communication thenp  pApproach 4 Is to wrap the HTML code given to the tinyMCE with an  tag, and then after editing, to strip it out. Would that sound like a decent solution I couldnt actually succeed in wrapping the html in an iframe inside on the tinymce input.p  pWhat do you guys say p

Negative 33380 pIve seen other responses to this on SO, but either I didnt understand how those responses worked in my situation or Im overthinking this scopes have always been a poor point of mine.p  pIm currently using colorbox for modal windows, containing iframes. To use it in angular, I created an attribute directive that takes the URL of an anchor tag and uses it to trigger colorbox. Typically, when a user does whatever action I need in the modal, Ive had JS trigger something in the parent window, to avoid reloading. This seems even more important in Angular, and Im trying to figure out how I can have said colorbox modal communicate with Angular. So far, the best I can think of is to have the modals JS change the value of an input or multiple inputs to define what I want it to do.p  pIs there any easiermore direct wayp  pstrongEDITstrong Thanks to the solution below, I found the answerp  precodevar appElement  parent.document.querySelector[ngappgamersplane] var scope  parent.angular.elementappElement.scope scope.applyfunction       Do your angular stuff in here  codepre  pThe key is parent on the element elector AND before angular.element.p
Negative 33380 pIm using node.js as a backend to stream mp3 files and angularjs to consume these mp3 files and reproduce them on the browser. At the moment, I have a folder in node.js directory called songs and an endpoint called getSongs that only returns localhost300 plus the name of each song in the directory, so that I can reproduce in the browser, for example localhost3000songsfile.mp3. Is this the correct way to stream mp3 in node.js Ive been researching in google and I could see that I may have to use a endpoint to send chunks of mp3 data to the client, whats the difference I would also like to have different directories for each user account and of course with security so that if Im not logged in as user1 I shouldnt have access to localhost3000songsuser1file.mp3. Whats the best way to do that thanksp

Negative 33380 pI am writing a Symfony2 bundle which requires Swift Mailer. I use Composer to require Swift Mailer and Composer is used to install the bundle.p  pI want to change the value of one private property in one Swift Mailer class.p  pOf course I could just change the property in the PHP code, but I want a much better solution that ensures when my bundle is installed Composer there is no other manual work involved i.e. manually changing the property in the PHP code.p  pI dont think Swift Mailer is a Symfony bundle, so I dont think I can use a compiler class. p  pI know I can configure Composer settings, but I dont think this is the solution. The issue of course is that I cant change any of the Swift Mailer code hence a Compiler pass would be great.p  pI dont think this is even possible, but surely I am able to do this without manual work every time my bundle is installedp

Negative 33380 pI have a dataset containing historical transaction records for real estate properties.  Each property has an ID number. To check if the data is complete, for each property I am identifying a transaction chain I take the original buyer, and go through all intermediate buyerseller combinations until I reach the final buyer of record. So for data that looks like thisp  pre BuyerSellerpropertyID BobJane23 TimBob23 KarlTim23 pre  pThe transaction chain will look like code[Jane, Bob, Tim, Karl]codep  pI am using three datasets to do this. The first contains the names of only the first buyer of each property.  The second contains the names of all intermediate buyers and sellers, and the third contains only the final buyer for each property. I use three datasets so I can follow the process given by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27260792pythoncombinationsofparentchildhierarchyvikramls answer herea.  p  pIn my version of the graph dictionary, each seller is a key to its corresponding buyer, and the oftcited findpath function finds the path from first seller to last buyer. The problem is that the dataset is very large, so I get a maximum recursion depth reached error. I think I can solve this by nesting the graph dictionary inside another dictionary where they key is the property id number, and then searching for the path within ID groups. However, when I tried p  precodegraph   propertyIDgraph    with openbuyersAndSellers.txt,r as f     for row in f         propertyid, seller, buyer  row.stripn.split         graph.setdefaultseller, [].appendbuyer         propertyIDgraph.setdefaultpropertyid, [].appendgraph f.close codepre  pIt assigned every buyerseller combination to every property id.

Negative 33380 pI am in secondary school and learning web development and our latest school project was to come up with our own company based around a website. p  pBasically my website is going to display aspiring animators videos, there is going to be a place where other users of the website can comment feedback on these videos and there are going to be other resources for the animators to use.p  pI have already created the base of the website. I have placeholder youtube videos on the home screen where the users videos would go and I have a contact page and a resource page. p  pBasically, my teacher told me that if I wanted the website to actually function, that is to have a login system where users can go in and be able to post their own videos for the other users to see, posting videos would most likely be in the form of submitting a youtube link, there the video would be displayed on the home page and have a comment system for other users to be able to leave feedback on other users videos and so on, my best option was to use a CMS e.g. Drupal. I was unsure if this would be my best option, because as far as my research goes, I believe that CMS are made for users to use their web templates and it doesnt work well for those who have already got a website coded. unsurep  pI am new to making websites but I am quite capable with a bit of learning. Basically, all I need to know is what method I should use to integrate this login system for users to be able to post and comment to my website and a way for an admin who would run the website to be able to manage the content on the website easily without having to change any of the code. Considering that I have already coded my website, I am unsure if this is possible and I do not have the time to start again. p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 33380 pI have a gallery view that I use to, surprise, view images.  I wanted it to be very similar to the standard iOS photo app with the same basic functionality scrolling through images that are zoomable. To do this, I use a regular scroll view which I then populate with other scroll views that contain the images. The basic idea is something like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comhifv5.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhifv5.jpg altenter image description hereap  pAnd, I do the populating the following wayp  precodefor int i  0 i lt [imageGalleryArray count] i      UIScrollView imageContainer                     [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMakewindowSize.width  i, 0.0f, windowSize.width, windowSize.height]     imageContainer.contentSize                       CGSizeMakewindowSize.width, windowSize.height     imageContainer.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator    NO     imageContainer.showsVerticalScrollIndicator      NO     imageContainer.bouncesZoom                       YES     imageContainer.delegate                          self     imageContainer.minimumZoomScale                  1.0f     imageContainer.maximumZoomScale                  3.0f         UIImageView imageView                       [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0.0f, 0.0f, windowSize.width, windowSize.height]         imageView.image                              [[imageGalleryArray objectAtIndexi] objectForKeyimage]         imageView.contentMode                        UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit         imageView.tag                                IMAGEZOOMVIEW         imageView.opaque                             YES         [imageContainer addSubviewimageView]     [galleryScrollView addSubviewimageContainer]       Add it to array for proper removal later     [contentScrollViewSubviewList addObjectimageContainer]  codepre  pQuite simple and it works fine. The only problem arises when I am zoomed into an image and want to scroll to another. The expected behavior in this case would be to set the zoom level of all images back to their original size. I do this in the scrollViewDidEndDecelerating delegate method like sop  precodeif scrollView.tag  GALLERYSCROLLVIEW      for int i  0 i lt [contentScrollViewSubviewList count] i              [[contentScrollViewSubviewList objectAtIndexi] setZoomScale1.0f animatedYES]       codepre  pUnfortunately, it does not work or rather not as intended. I did some poking around and found out that the image does indeed animate back to its original size when it strongis the active slidestrong. To elaborate if I zoom into an image and scroll to another, the image stays zoomed in. When I scroll back to it, that is when it zooms back to its original size. I, however, need the image to scale back as soon as I move away from it . just like in the iOS image viewer.p  pFrankly, I do not understand the whole zoom mechanic enough to find out how to do this properly, and the UIScrollView documentation is of no help either. Could someone show me how to solve my problemp

Negative 33380 pFollowing are just three happensbefore rules of JMM. I am not listing the other rules as my question is related to these three rules only.p  ul liMonitor lock rule. An unlock on a monitor lock happens before every subsequent lock on that same monitor lock.li liThread start rule. A call to Thread.start on a thread happens before every action in the started thread.li liInterruption rule. A thread calling interrupt on another thread happens before the interrupted thread detects the interrupt either by having InterruptedException thrown, or invoking isInterrupted or interrupted.li ul  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol lipstrong1st rule questionstrong  Lets say two threads A and B have synchronized blocks of code. Does the first rule mean that any variable set in a synchronized block in thread A, will be visible to the code in synchronized block of thread B, even if the variable is NOT declared as volatilepli lipstrong2nd rule questionstrong  Lets say a thread A starts a thread B. Does the second rule mean that any variable set in a parent thread before calling start will be visible to thread B even if the variable is NOT declared as volatilepli lipstrong3rd rule questionstrong  Lets say a thread A interrupts a thread B. Does the third rule mean that any variable set in thread A before interrupting thread B will be visible to thread B after the interrupt is detected, even if the variable is not declared as volatilepli ol  pFinally, one more questionp  ol start4 liIn BlockingQueue documentation, it is said,   blockquote   pMemory consistency effects As with other concurrent collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a BlockingQueue happenbefore actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from the BlockingQueue in another thread.p blockquoteli ol  pDoes this mean any variable set in a thread A before enqueuing an object in the blocking queue will be visible to thread B after dequeuing the object from the queue, even if the variable is NOT declared as volatilep  pBasically through the above questions, I am trying to understand if the memory flush happens after these events such that the variables need not be declared as volatile in these cases.p

Negative 33380 pIm updating a site which appears to use jScrollPane  v2.0.0beta11  20110704, which Id like to update to the latest version, not least of all because I want the scroll pane to be responsive, which I dont think is a feature in this version.p  pBefore I start messing with it, I just wanted to check a couple of things  Im learning as I go, so would appreciate any help or advice...p  pThere arent any individual files with jScroll in the name, but I found 4 blocks of minified code and license info in a file called script.js Im assuming the previous devs used a preprocessor to compile several scripts into one file.p  pQ1 I downloaded 2.0.0beta11 from GitHub to compare the code and noticed that the version control date is different from what I have by nearly a year my version shows jScrollPanev2.0.0beta1120110704, GitHub version shows jScrollPanev2.0.2220150425, which is a little worrying btw there is nothing matching my date on GH. The code also appears ever so slightly different  Im hoping this doesnt mean anything, but if anyone knows otherwise, perhaps you can clear up the mysteryp  pQ2 My plan is to delete the 4 blocks from script.js and use files from the latest version to compile a new code block.  Ive never updated a plugin before, is that all I have to do to update it or have I missed something  p  pQ3 Assuming the previous devs didnt change anything, does anyone know if I should be expecting any breakages updating jScrollPanev2.0.0beta1120110704 to jScrollPanev2.0.2220150425  I appreciate its a big jumpp  pAlternatively, I didnt see any security fixes in the changelog post 2.0.0beta11, so I could just leave it alone...  Any thoughts p

Negative 33380 pThe thought of pranking a coworker has lead me to thinking of ways to find perfect English Pangrams. I plan to write a program using dynamic programming techniques to try to determine possible perfect pangrams, unless someone else knows of one that already exists, or is able to provide me with a known solution.p  pThe prank I plan to do is arrange the keys on a coworkers keyboard to be a pangram that makes sense, but in order to do so, the characters can only appear once.p  pAs a programmer, I thought of this as an interesting problem and after doing some googling, I have not found a pangram that doesnt have repeating characters. p  pWith the limited number of vowels of the English language, I expect it might be impossible. If it is not impossible, Im curious is there is a sentence that can be create that will make sense.p
