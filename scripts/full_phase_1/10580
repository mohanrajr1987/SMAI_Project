Positive 10580 pI am working on an small webapp that does the followingp  ul lishowing a fullscreen mapli liuser sees a short form and enters name, email and uploads a photoli lithe photo is set as a marker on the mapli ul  pNow ... using HTML5 geolocation the user is asked by the browser at the first start if he allows the browser to check his location.p  pIf he accepts everything is fine. If the user declines, his decision is saved and a geolocation by means of HTML5 cannot be retrieved unless the user manually revokes his refusal. That is not practical.p  pBut I need the users location to put the marker on the map.p  pI was thinking about  using the location retrieved by HTML5 if the user accepted  if he refused use an IP based location check which is not as accurate in order to have this easy and seamless user experiencep  pOr as an alternative have the user manually select his location by marking it on the map. But I would like to make it as easy as possible for the user with only a few clicks. And this workflow would not be very easy to handle on a small smartphone screen for mobile version.p  pAny ideas on that What would your workflow look likep

Positive 10580 pMore than a question this may be general information . I am using a VPN service and located in the Middle East. Ive found most if not all but one  IP geolocation webpages shows my location as New York which matches the VPN IP address. But the service whatismyipaddresdotcom shows the correct IP address and my location in Kuwait. Clicking some links on the mentioned webpage it takes me to a page showing they use several services from which one is showing Kuwait and the other two New York. However,contary on the expected majority vote, they pick the single one different which,  in fact,  is right. As you can see they do not mention the name, but I believe the provider is Maxmind maxminddotcom.p  pSorry, not allowed to post imagesp  pDoes anyone knows what they may be using  router MAC Google account .I use VPN to access ESPN , etc , but if this method is used by all other geoloc services in the future ,it  will render the VPN unusable p

Positive 10580 pIve had quite some issues with the Geolocation Cordova plugin org.apache.cordova.geolocation. It works fine on iOS, but it doesnt at all on Android.p  pAs I understand, the plugin used to include native Android code, but this was removed at some point, because it was too buggyslow and the native web HTML5 implementation was much more stable and fast.p  pIf I use the latest plugin version 0.3.2 which still has the native code, it does work but slow and indeed, not always. But when it does return, the position object is always populated.p  pIf I use the latest plugin version 1.0.1, the getCurrentPosition immediately returns with an empty object . It does not throw an error.p  pIf I remove the plugin completely, and add the permissions manually to the Android projectp  precodeltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSCOARSELOCATION gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSFINELOCATION gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSLOCATIONEXTRACOMMANDS gt codepre  pThe same thing happens.

Positive 10580 pIm working on a Track amp Share Module for Pilots, the app is build with AngularJS within Ionic and Cordova framework. Im currently developting and testing for android only.p  pThe case There are four buttons, first checks if gps is enabled, second starts the tracking, third stops the tracking, fourth send the trackdata to the webAPI if internet connection is stable. I cant guarantee 100 connectivity up in the air, so I cant send the trackdata on every tracked waypoint direct to the api  I have to store it until the aircraft is on the ground again.p  pThe problem The tracked waypoints are 1 temporallytimely highly variable I cant get any pattern on my testtracks and 2 the tracked altitudeheadingspeed data isnt recorded on some trackpoints.p  pMy flown testroute is about 40 minutes. Im tracking every 60 seconds. So I must get at least minimum 3540 trackpoints. But I just get between 9 and 15 trackpoints on that route..p  pTrackpointsp  p144205071221851.45144956.8892898nullnullnull  12.9.2015 113832 144205132792451.51834416.8183962nullnullnull  12.9.2015 114848 144205151152951.85694736.8611548nullnullnull  12.9.2015 115152 144205173240151.98287946.9063169nullnullnull  12.9.2015 115532 144205191250352.02339096.959695913006452.25   12.9.2015 115833 144205201482852.04006277.032223813327551.25   12.9.2015 120015 144205251758352.14721767.381340913077051.5    12.9.2015 120838 144205274641052.18590827.539281112176853      12.9.2015 121226 144205311933852.2242717.874347nullnullnull    12.9.2015 121839 144205340132452.26770447.9679879nullnullnull  12.9.2015 122321p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comScZ5S.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comScZ5S.jpg altTrackpoints in my webviewap  precode.serviceTrackingFunctions, [interval, rootScope, localstorage, functioninterval, rootScope, localstorage        Erstellt einmalige global Referenz, dass immer die selbe Instanz angesprochen wird     var tracker          this.doTracking  functionexecTracking             ifexecTracking  if no tracker start new                 localstorage.TRACKDATA  []                  return intervalfunction                     localstorage.isTrackerActive  true                     var geooptions                           enableHighAccuracy true,                         maximumAge 30000,                         timeout 20000                                          function geosuccessposition                          console.logposition                          var tsmp  position.timestamp                         var lat  position.coords.latitude                         var lng  position.coords.longitude                         var alt  position.coords.altitude                         var hdg  position.coords.heading                         var spd  position.coords.speed                          var ARRAYDATA  tsmp    lat    lng    alt   hdg    spd                            localstorage.TRACKDATA.pushARRAYDATA                                           function geoerror                          scope.alt  Fehler   error.message   Error Code   error.code                                          var wpid  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPositiongeosuccess, geoerror, geooptions                  ,60000  getrackt wird alle 60 Sekunden               else   if tracker cancel                 interval.cancelexecTracking                 console.logtracker deaktiviert                       ] codepre  pHow can I fix that the app tracks every 60 seconds and the missing data will be recorded, too The function is crucial fot the app and webservice for flighttraining for soloflights of the student pilot.p  pThank you.p

Negative 10580 pI was using a CASE called a hrefhttpwww.magicsoftware.com relnofollowMAGICa for a system Im developing, Ive never used this kind of tool before and at first sight I liked, a month later I had a lot of the application generated, I felt very productive and ... I would say ... satisfied.p  pIn some way a felt uncomfortable, cause, there is no code and everything I was used to, but in the other hand I could speed up my developing. The fact is that eventually I returned to use C because I find it more flexible to develop, I can make unit testing, use CVS, I have access to more resources and basically I had all the control. I felt that this tool didnt give me confidence and I thought that later in the project I could not manage it due to its forced established rules of development. And also a lot of things like sending emails, using my own controls, and other things had their complication, it seemed that at some point it was not going to be as easy as initially I thought and as initially the product claims. This reminds me a very nice article called a hrefhttpwww.virtualschool.edumonSoftwareEngineeringBrooksNoSilverBullet.html relnofollowNo Silver Bulleta.p  pThis CASE had its advantages but on the other hand it doesnt have resources you can consult and actually the license and certification are very expensive. For me another dissapointing thing is that because of its simplistic approach for development I felt scared on first hand cause of my unexperience on these kind of tools and second cause I thought that if I continued using it maybe it would have turned to be a complex monster that I could not manage later in the project.p  pI think its good to use these kind of solutions to speed up things but I wonder, why arent these programs as popular as VS.Net, J2EE, Ruby, Python, etc. if they claim to enhace productivity better than the tools Ive pointedp

Negative 10580 pI have two C DLLs that I need to access in the same executable. I have header files and .LIB files for both libraries. Unfortunately a subset of the functions that I need to access have the exact same names. The best solution I have been able to come up with so far is to use LoadLibrary to load one of the DLLs and explicitly call its methods using GetProcAddress. Is there a way for me to implicitly load both libraries and somehow give the compiler a hint that in one case I want to call OpenApi in DLL A and in the other case I want to call OpenApi in DLL Bp  pIm developing my executable in C using Visual Studio 2008 and the corresponding C runtime library msvcr90.dll.p  p[Edit]p  pCommenter Ilya asks below what I dont like about the GetProcAddress solution. I dont like it for two reasonsp  ol liIt makes the code more complex. One line of code to call a function is replaced with three lines of code, one to define the function signature, one to call GetProcAddress, and one to actually call the function. li liIts more prone to runtime errors. If I misspell the function name or mess up the signature I dont see the error until runtime. Say I decide to integrate a new version of the dll and one of the method names has changed, it will compile just fine and wont have a problem until the actual call to GetProcAddress, which could possibly even be missed in a test pass.li ol
Negative 10580 pIs there a USB HID pen driver in Windows Vista  If so, what are the requirements for USB descriptors, in order to make Windows Vista recognize the pen and load the pen driverp  pWhat Im searching for is the pen equivalent to the HID mouse driver, HID keyboard driver and mass storage driver. The mentioned example drivers makes it possible for Windows, Linux and Mac OS to recognize mouse, keyboard and memory sticks without installing new drivers.p  pWindows Vista has a lot of native support for pen, and it is possible to define a USB pen device only using standard HID usage tables from a USB protocol point of view. So far Im able to make USB HID descriptors that qualify as mouse and keyboard from OS point of view, and automatically uses the standard driver supplied by the OS. p  pFor my Pen, however, Windows Vista just loads the generic HID driver, and does not realize that the device is a pen. The motivation for defining a pen rather than a mouse with absolute coordinates, is that Vista supports special features like gestures, but this is only enabled for PenDigitizer devices.p

Negative 10580 pSo I understand SqlDataReader is quite fast, you dont know how many rows youll get and it only allocates memory for each row at a time. So if I have a million rows of small rows say 4 to 32 bytes each row read means a roundtrip to the server No buffering takes place rightp  pIf I used ODBC via SQL Native Client I could setup a row buffer appropriately large to fetch say 512 rows each roundtrip. When the consumer reads row 0 I do a fetch of 512 rows and then return row 0, the next 511 reads are memory accesses and the 513th read is a new roundtrip. p  pTo me this should be faster and wouldnt have to be forward only, however it depends on how the result set is materialized on the server also. In the latter case the result set would have to be finished before I can start fetching over the network, but may not be the case  for SqlDataReader and TDS which I believe it uses, a protocol Im not familiar with. Any comments appreciated. p

Negative 10580 pI just found out about the Boost Phoenix library hidden in the Spirit project and as a fan of the functionalprogramming style but still an amateur some small experience with haskell and scheme i wanted to play around with this library to learn about strongemreasonable applications of this library.emstrongp  pBesides the increasement of expressiveness and clarity of the code using fpstyle, im especially strongeminterested in lazyevaluation for speeding up computations at low costs.emstrongp  pA small and simple example would be the following there is some kind of routing problem like the tsp, which is using a eucliedean distance matrix. We assume, that some of the values of the distance matrix are never used, and some are used very often so it isnt a good idea to compute them on the fly for every call. Now it seems to be reasonable to have a strongemlazy datastructureemstrong holding the distance values. How would that be possible with phoenix ignoring the fact that i would be easily done without fpstyleprogramming at all Reading the official documentation of phoenix didnt let me understand enough to answer that.p  pIs it possible at all in Haskell for example the ability to create thunks which are guaranteeing that the value can be computed later are in the core of the language.p  pWhat does using a vector with all the lazy functions defined in phoenix mean As naive as i am, i tried to fill two matrices vector  with random values, one with the normal pushback, the other with boostphoenixpushback and tried to read out only a small amount of values from these matrices and store them in a container for printing out. The lazy one was alway empty. Am i using phoenix in a wrong way  it should be possible Or did i misunderstand the function of the containersalgorithms in phoenix. A small clue for the latter one is the existence of a special listdatastructure in the FP library, which influenced phoenix.p  pAdditionallyp  ul liWhat are you using phoenix forli liDo you know some good ressources regarding phoenix tutorials, blog entries...li ul  pThanks for all your inputp

Negative 10580 pWe got a 12core MacPro to do some Monte Carlo calculations. Its Intel Xeon processors have HyperThreading HT enabled, so in fact there should be 24 processes running in parallel to make them fully utilized. However, our calcs are more efficient to run on 12x100 than 24x50, so we tried to turn HyperThreading off via codeProcessorcode pane in system preferences in order to get higher performance. One can also turn HT off byp  precodehwprefs v cpuhtfalse codepre  pThen we ran some tests and here is what we gotp  ol li12 parallel tasks run the same time w or wo HT to our disappointment.li li24 parallel tasks loose 20 if HT is off not 50 as we thoughtli liWhen HT is on, switching from 24 to 12 tasks decreases efficiency by 20 also surprisingli liWhen HT is off, switching from 24 to 12 doesnt change anything.li ol  pIt seems that HyperThreading just decreases performance for our calculations and there is no way to avoid it. The program we use for the calcs is written in Fortran and compiled with codegfortrancode. Is there a way to make it more efficient with this piece of hardwarep  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong Our Monte Carlo calculations MCC are typically done in steps to avoid data loss and due to other reasons its not always possible to avoid such steps. In our case each step consists of many simulations with variable duration. Since each step is splited between a number of parallel tasks, they also have variable duration. Essentially, all faster tasks have to wait until the slowest is done. This fact forces us to make bigger steps, which finish with less deviation in time due to averaging, so processors do not waste their time on waiting. This is our motivation for having 122.66 GHz instead of 241.33 GHz. If it would be possible to turn HT off, then we would get about 10 performance by switching from 24 tasks w HT to 12 tasks wo HT. However, the tests show that we loose 20. So my conclusion is that the calculation is 30 as inefficient.p  pFor the tests I used quite large steps, however usually steps are shorter, so efficiency becomes even further.p  pThere is one more reason  some of our calculations require 35 GB of memory, so you probably see how economical it would be for us to have 12 fast tasks. We are working on implementing shared memory, but its going to be a looong term project. Therefore we need to find out how to make the existing hardwaresoftware as fast as possible.p
Negative 10580 pAlternate question title would be emHow to explicitly have the compiler generate code for the compilergenerated constructors in a specific translation unitemp  pThe problem we face is that for one code path the resulting  strongthoroughly measuredstrong  performance is better by about 5 if the copyctor calls of one object are emnotem inlined, that is if this constructor is implemented manually. We noticed this because during codecleanup the superfluous explicitly implemented copy ctor of this class 17 members was removed.p  pstrongEditstrong Note that we emhaveem checked the generated assembly code and have made sure that the inlining and code generation is happening as I describe for the two different code versions. p  pWe face now the choice of just dropping the manual copyctor code back in it does exactly the same as the compiler generated one or finding any other means of emnotem inlining the copy ctor of this class.p  pIs there any means for Microsoft Visual C to explicitly instantiate the compiler generated class functions in a specific translation unit or will  they always be inlined in each translation unit where they are used Comments for gcc or other compilers are also welcome to get a better picture of the situation.p  hr  pSince the first 2 answers show some misunderstanding The emcompiler generatedem class functions are only generated by the compiler itself if they are neither declared nor defined by the user. Therefore no modifiers whatsoever can be applied to them, since these function emdo not existem in the sourcecode.p  precodestruct A    stdstring member  codepre  pcodeAcode has a default and copy ctor, a dtor and a copy operator. Neither of these function can be modified via some declspec because they do not exist in the code.p  precodestruct B    stdstring member   BB constamp rhs  codepre  pcodeBcode now has a emuser suppliedem copy ctor and the user has to implement it. The compiler will not generate code for it.p  hr  pSome more background for the doubters  ...p  pThis code is compiled using MS Visual C, but it is linked for an embeddedlike realtime system. Performance was measured by taking timings on this system and I therefore think the guys who took the timings will have some decent numbers.p  pThe test was performed by comparing two code versions where the emonlyem difference was the inline vs. the notinline copy ctor of this one class. Timings with the inlined code were worse by about 5.p  hr  pFurther checking has revealed that I was mistaken in one point The compiler emwillem generate separate functions for complex copy constructors. It will do this on its own discretion and it also depends on the optimization settings. So in our case the compiler is doing the wrong thing in our specific circumstances. From the answers so far it does not appear we can tell the compiler otherwise. p

All good so far This method then calls a method within the user control, passing in the data, which in turn is used to requery, and rebind the repeater. p  pFor some reason, the page bails when I try to do this last partp  pIf this seems converluted, its because it doesnt seem possible in jquery to directly access user control methods.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 10580 pIm thinking of creating a class in XNA 3.1 that handles the drawing of shadows. I know there are lots of ways to do this but Im wanting to do something like a List of all the objects that should have a shadow and pass that List to the shadow class so it iterates through each object and draws a shadow.p  pThe reason I want to do it like this is cause I could easily control whether shadows exist or not with just a boolean.p  pA List for all types is probably unlikely, my backup is a List of type Object but I dont know how to cast the elements in the List which are of type Object back into their respective types so I can access their properties.p  pMy second backup is make all the objects that will have shadows derive from a class called ShadowObject or something and make the List of that type. This is a really easy solution but the reason Im not doing it yet is cause I dont like the idea of a dummy class just to make something work, but maybe I should start liking it.p  pMy final backup would be to go into each class that will have shadows and have a boolean to see if shadows should be drawn and handle the drawing in the class itself, which I think shouldnt even be considered an option cause if I want to change the shadow mechanics I would have to change it in every class.p  pSo I guess a List for all types is my official question for the public but Im open to answers, suggestions, and criticism to my backup plans.p  pEdit Im aware of interfaces but my response to that is in the comments for xixonias answer and after reading up a little more on interfaces I think having a ShadowCaster class would be more appropriate. It can handle all the shadow drawing because all shadows are drawn the same way, I dont need to define it for each object individually like an interface would require me to.p

Negative 10580 pAll,p  pIm working on a web app exclusively for the iPad that uses a modified version of the Coda Slider httpwww.ndoherty.bizdemoscodaslider2.0.p  pOne of the sliding panels includes a text box.p  pWhen I use the unmodified version of the slider, it works great. I can click the text box to get focus, and the iOS selectcopypaste functions work as usual.p  pHowever, by default, the Coda Slider uses jquery.animate. Since Im targeting the iPad exclusively, I decided to replace animate with CSS3, webkittransition, webkittransform, and translate3d. The result is MUCH smoother animation, since tranlate3d is hardware accelerated.p  pAs part of my modification, Im adjusting the left style instead of marginLeft the property that Coda Slider animates by default.p  pSo far  so good. Everything works as Id hoped.p  pThe only problem  while Im still able to click the input text box to focus in it and the keyboard works still works to let me type  the SelectCopyPaste functions dont work.p  pIn other words  you can type in the field, but if you tap and hold  you dont get the SelectCopyPaste popup menu.p  pFor those not familiar with the Coda Slider  in short  each panel of the slider is a div, and all panels are wrapped in a container div. The animation works by moving the container div left and right within a wrapper div with overflow set to hidden.p  pAs I mentioned  by default, the Coda slider moves the container div left and right by adjusting its marginLeft property. p  pSo long as I keep that behavior  the selectcopypaste works fine. As soon as I change it to use the left property instead of marginLeft  selectcopypaste stops working.p  pHas anyone run into this issue before I dont know if the issue is specific to my implementation, my modification of the default Coda Slider code, or something else.p  pMany thanks in advance for any advice or insight.p

Negative 10580 pWhen recently designing a medium to large scale web app, I decided to go with a clientheavy implementation of webforms rather than asp.net MVC for the UI layer. p  pThe reason being that with webforms it is easy to quickly knock up screens and glue together a web app I use Teleriks radcontrols extensively as they have a rich client model. I find that the earlier I get a prototype UI infront of a client, the quicker they can look at it and evolve it into what they really want.p  pWhen I say clientheavy webforms, I mostly bind data clientside and then use web services to handle events from the client  the web services interact with my business layer and deal in JSON. The advantage comes when, say, one UI event requires that many controls be updated  I can then fall back on the asp.net page cycle and fire off a partialpostback having wrapped the various controls in update panels.p  pThe way I see it, I can have my cake and I can eat it I can use lightningfast JSON web services for performance critical areas of my app but I can revert to the postbackpartial postback model for complex UI areas. All in all, less development time and performant where it matters.p  pSo finally, a questionp  pIm not trying to resist MVC just simply asking is it better than what Im doing above and if so, why   p

So after updating the first rowinternalstate value from 1 to 0 postgre is checking the constraint and throwing error even before updating the second row.p  pIs there a way to avoid this situationp

I have a couple of questions here p  pA If I could figure out how to use OllyDbg well enough to fiddle the string literal exit into axit AFTER the call foo is made, I believe the output would still be exit in case 1 and 3, and exit in case 2. Is this correctp  pB In case 1 and 3, I believe that because the method is asking for a String even if it is a reference in case 1, there is an implicit call to the string constructor it accepts const char, and that constructor ALWAYS makes a copy, never a reference. see a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencestringstringstring relnofollowcplusplus.com string pagea  Is this correct especially the ALWAYSp  pC In case 1, if I initialised a new class which had a stringamp attribute to which I assigned the text variable, will this reference wind up pointing to bad memory when we leave the scope IE, when we reach 4, I believe the following has happened assuming fooconst stringamp text is the uncommented function    1. A temporary string object is create for the line fooEXIT that copies the literal.    2. The reference to the temp object is passed through to bar and to the strBar attribute    3. Once the code moves on and leaves the scope in which fooEXIT was called, I believe that the temp string object goes out of scope and disappears, which means strBar now references an area of memory with undefined contents, thinking it is still a string.p  pD Going back to A, I believe in case 2 fooconst char text that this call to foo references the literal itself, not a copy, which is why fiddling with the literal in memory would change the output.  Is this correct Could I continue to pass the literal through say to Bar if I continued to use const charp  pE How would you go about testing any of this beyond this is how it works and read the specs I dont need step by step instructions, but some ideas on what I should have done to answer the question myself using the tools I have available Visual Studio, OllyDbg, suggestions for others would be great. Ive spent a goodly amount of time trying to do it, and Id like to hear what people have to say.p

Negative 10580 pI am currently trying to maintain a postgres database of player information when Ive encountered an issue with one of our players. The player came to us saying that he could not load his character into the game world. I did a small SELECT statement to pull up the player information with no problems. However, when they try to use a character then we update a field in the row that says that the player character is active. However we noticed that we couldnt run an update or a delete statement on that row. Every other row in the table gets modified without any issues.p  pOn of our DB admins thought that it was a lock that was applied on that row, but after further investigation with see nothing that could be locking that row.p  pAny advice or suggestions is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 10580 pIve just created a ASP.NET MVC3 application with a deployment package. In my IIS7.5 running on a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine I deployed the package, in a new site MySite. So, looking at the site tree, I have two nodes, MySite and Default Web Site. MySite  has a subnode called MyApplication the one I have imported. The bindings of MySite are pointing to port 95. ApplicationPoolIdentity is using a user login administrator on the server since the application need to impersonate a user. Everything is running well on the application identity side I have checked this Now, when I try to access the application, I get the message the adress is restricted on my firefox browser. I type in a hrefhttpmyserver95MySiteMyApplication relnofollowhttpmyserver95MySiteMyApplicationa.  The strange thing is that everything works on Windows 7 Are there some special security restrictions on Windows Server The signal is that accessing the Windows 7 adress I get the IIS7 welcome page, but this does not happen if I try to access the Windows server one. And the IIS on windows server is up and running since Im hosting a TFS server which is working perfectly Any ideasp

Negative 10580 pIn the following code, p  precodeFor Each item in MyCollection ... Next codepre  pWhat does the compiler use to determine the type of codeitemcodep  pFor example let say I have this class, which is inheriting a non generic collection, p  precodePublic Class BaseDataObjectGenericCollectionOf T     Inherits BaseDataObjectCollection End Class codepre  pA for each loop still infers the Item type as codeObjectcode. How would I have to modify the above class to make the type inference workp  pEdit Per Beatles1692s answer, Implementing IEnumeratorOf T kinda works. The base class already has a codeGetEnumeratorcode function, inherited from codeCollectionBasecode, so I my implementation looked like this, p  precode    Public Function GetEnumerator1 As System.Collections.Generic.IEnumeratorOf T Implements System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerableOf T.GetEnumerator         Return MyBase.CastOf T.GetEnumerator     End Function codepre  pHowever, the for loop still infers the type as object. But, if I change the interface implementation to this, p  precode    Public Shadows Function GetEnumerator As System.Collections.Generic.IEnumeratorOf T Implements System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerableOf T.GetEnumerator         Return MyBase.CastOf T.GetEnumerator     End Function codepre  pThat works, the for loop gets the type inference correct. So I guess the question is now, does codeFor Eachcode just look for a function called codeGetEnumeratorcode p

Hope some of you could spare the time to help me.p  pstrongThe scenariostrong br  There is a web application which uses spring mvc.

The persistence layer itself handles the work with a local mysql instances.p  pstrongMy Problemstrong br  So far for the understanding of the scenario. I have a JUnit test inside the maven project that contains the persistence layer. The Test loads and save an object of an entityclass. This is handled over the Service. Both operations work fine.p  pNow im trying the same thing inside the web app. Again im trying to save and load an entity object. Again in a JUnit Test. But this time it fails. Spring states that the Repository reference inside the Service couldnt be autowired, cause there is no bean that would fit for that.p  pI tryed multiple things to get this solved, like using a direct wiring, giving qualifiers and so one. No of my actions worked. I even build two complete new maven projects where i simplified the scenario a bit, but left the nessarcy things the same. There it worked like a charm.

Negative 10580 pI have written a little program that parses log files of anywhere between a few thousand lines to a few hundred thousand lines. For this, I have a function in my code which parses every line, looks for keywords, and returns the keywords with the associated values.p  pThese log files contain of little sections. Each section has some values Im interested in and want to store as a dictionary.p  pI have simplified the sample below, but the idea is the same.p  pMy original function looked like this, it gets called between 100 and 10000 times per run, so you can understand why I want to optimize itp  precodedef parsetxtf     d       for line in f         if not line             pass          elif apples in line             d[apples]  True          elif bananas in line             d[bananas]  True          elif line.startswithEnd of section             return d   f  openfruit.txt,r d  parsetxtf print d  codepre  pThe problem I run into, is that I have a lot of conditionals in my program, because it checks for a lot of different things and stores the values for it. And when checking every line for anywhere between 0 and 30 keywords, this gets slow fast. I dont want to do that, because, not every time I run the program Im interested in everything. Im only ever interested in 56 keywords, but Im parsing every line for 30 or so keywords.p  pIn order to optimize it, I wrote the following by using exec on a stringp  precodedef makefuncargs     funcstr   def parsetxtf     d       for line in f         if not line             pass           if apples in args         funcstr            elif apples in line             d[apples]  True       if bananas in args         funcstr            elif bananas in line             d[bananas]  True       funcstr            elif line.startswithEnd of section             return d      print funcstr     execfuncstr     return parsetxt  args  [apples,bananas] fun  makefuncargs f  openfruit.txt,r d  funf print d codepre  pThis solution works great, because it speeds up the program by an order of magnitude and it is relatively simple. Depending on the arguments I put in, it will give me the first function, but without checking for all the stuff I dont need. p  pFor example, if I give it codeargs[bananas]code, it will not check for codeapplescode, which is exactly what I want to do.p  pThis makes it much more efficient.p  pHowever, I do not like it this solution very much, because it is not very readable, difficult to change something and very error prone whenever I modify something. Besides that, it feels a little bit dirty.p  pI am looking for alternative or better ways to do this. I have tried using a set of functions to call on every line, and while this worked, it did not offer me the speed increase that my current solution gives me, because it adds a few function calls for every line. My current solution doesnt have this problem, because it only has to be called once at the start of the program. I have read about the security issues with exec and eval, but I do not really care about that, because Im the only one using it.p  pEDIT I should add that, for the sake of clarity, I have greatly simplified my function. From the answers I understand that I didnt make this clear enough. I do not check for keywords in a consistent way. Sometimes I need to check for 2 or 3 keywords in a single line, sometimes just for 1. I also do not treat the result in the same way. For example, sometimes I extract a single value from the line Im on, sometimes I need to parse the next 5 lines.p

Negative 10580 pim only new enough to java. im tring to fill a 6x6 grid in with 6 differnet colours without the same colour appearing in the same row or column. in my code i set up a 6x6 grid of JButtons stored in an array called buttons. when i press one of these JButtons a 6x1 grid of JButtons is set up called paintBox. the JButtons in paintBox are declared at the top of the program as fillRed,fillYellow etc. when i press fillRed it sets the back round of the JButton from the 6x6 grid red but when i press a different JButton from the 6x6 grid and try set that to yellow it sets it to yellow but also sets the original JButton that was set to red to yellow as well. any help would be great.  thanks       p  precodeimport javax.swing.     import java.awt.event.     import java.awt.

I guess its something with UIGestureRecognizer, which I saw from other doodle codes. Is it necessary to add UIGestureRecognizer to it I havent learned anything about it so I was trying to avoid using it. But if its a must, I will give a try.p  pAnother approach I am thinking of is to store all the point positions to an mutable array, because I have to store these point position values somewhere. However, I dont know if array is suitable because I havent find a way to store floating values to the array. It will be greatly helpful if anyone can help me with this. Thank youp

It does also occur in CheckOutputFile, but that method is currently commented out.p  pIm new to this website, so Im not quite sure how to put code, so the results will be quite shoddy.p  precodeException in thread AWTEventQueue1 java.security.AccessControlException      access denied  java.io.FilePermission Hiscore.txt write codepre  h2Codeh2  precode import java.awt.   import java.awt.event.   import javax.swing.   import javax.swing.event.   import java.io.File   import java.io.PrintWriter   import java.io.IOException   import java.io.FileNotFoundException  import java.util.Scanner    public class TowerDefence extends JApplet implements MouseListener     int xpos, ypos, money, attackspawn, attackcount, lives, attackerhealth, hiscore,  laser         x,y location of current square  private DrawingArea canvas     JPanel canvas on which to draw grid  private int[][] numbers       private int[][] damage  JPanel startscreen  File ifile, ofile, qfile  Scanner input, output, questionreader  boolean start, play, checkhiscore, fileexists, end, inquestionstate  long totaldamage  Timer timer  boolean [][] moved  JButton button  public File fargle  PrintWriter makesOutput   JButton begin      Constructor   public TowerDefence       inquestionstate  false   JButton begin  new JButton BEGIN   begin  new JButtonBEGIN   checkhiscore  false   xpos  ypos  attackcount  laser  4           button  new JButtonDouble Damage for 15 seconds   money  200   attackspawn  0   totaldamage  0   lives  10   attackerhealth  24   fileexists  true   numbers  new int[30][30]       damage  new int [20][20]   moved  new boolean  [20][20]   Timer timer   end  false   for int i  0 ilt 20 i       for int j  0 jlt 20 j           moved[i][j]  false           damage [i][j]  0             for int i  0 ilt30 i       for int j  0 jlt30 j           numbers[i][j]  0             start  false   play  false   ifile  new Filemap.txt   ofile  new File hiscore.txt   qfile  new Filequestions.txt   RepaintAction action  new RepaintAction   timer  new Timer1000, action   timer.start      private class RepaintAction implements ActionListener    public void actionPerformedActionEvent evt    repaint   Call the repaint method in the panel class.

Negative 10580 pI have a unique problem I am trying to solve with a Spring Roobuilt site that I recently added OpenID support for.  I a hrefhttpforum.springsource.orgshowthread.php127999OutputUserDetailspropertiesinJSPXwithsupportforformandOpenIDlogin relnofollowposted something on the Spring Forumsa, and tried to describe the problem to the best of my ability, but so far I havent received any help.p  pHere is the synopsis, as best I can describe it.  The site I am working on had a simple form login, using Spring Security and the JDBCUserDetailsService.  We also wanted users the ability to login via a supported OpenID, so using the a hrefhttpgit.springsource.orgltaylorspringsecuritylukesspringsecurityblobsee1fd1bc50a7232617a4668c4fcd450958cab437samplesopenidsrcmainjavaorgspringframeworksecuritysamplesopenidCustomUserDetailsService.java relnofollowSpring Security examples for implementing OpenID w autoregistrationa we modified our site code to allow both simple form AND OpenID login.  The UserDetails is still coming from the database, the only difference being that the OpenID userid is the full authentication url string passed back from the OpenID provider.p  pThe problem I am running into is in our header code.  We had some simple JSPX code that did the followingp  precode  ltcchoosegt     ltcwhen testpageContext[request].userPrincipal  nullgt       ltspangt         ltform methodpost actionlogin nameloginform idloginformgt           ltinput namejusername typetext idjusername gt           ltinput namejpassword typepassword idjpassword gt           ltinput namesubmit typesubmit idproceed gt         ltformgt       ltspangt       ltspangtor lta hrefregistrationformgtRegisterltagtltspangt     ltcwhengt     ltcotherwisegt       ltspangtHello, lta hrefuserprofilebasepageContext[request].userPrincipal.namegtltimg srcuserimgurl width10 height10 gtpageContext[request].userPrincipal.nameltagtltspangt  lta hreflogoutgtLogoutltagt     ltcotherwisegt   ltcchoosegt codepre  pBasically, if the user Principal is not in the page context i.e. the user is not logged in, then display the login for, otherwise print out a nice Welcome... with the users username.  This code required no special provisions in the controller code to function Either the user was logged in or not.p  pNow the problem is with the OpenID users.  The username is no longer a nice, user defined string.  Instead its a long URL string that may or may not contain a userreadable ID name in it somewhere Google, for instance, has some nebulous string that looks like a GUID.p  pI thought about adding an Alias field to the user object stored in the DB which happens to be an instance of UserDetails, fwiw, and allowing the user to set it themselves, but I dont know how to get at that data from the JSPXside in a generic way.  I know someone out there is trying to do something similar, but I havent been able to find anything thing showing how they approached it.p

Negative 10580 pI have transcripts of data in MS Word want to read into a stats program called R.  The problem is these documents contain special characters not plain text.  My process for dealing with them has been to sub them out in MS Wordsave as a txt documentread into MS Excel makes a column for people and dialogue using the import wizardConvert to .csvread into R.  This process works but is time consuming.  I found out how to read the text with special characters right into R R generally wants plain text but this requires the document be in an excel document.  This is desirable because if I can read the special characters into R its rather simple to sub out all the special characters at once.  The problem arises because I cant get the MS Word document into Excel directly.  I have to save it as a text file first which I dont mind doing and then read it in.  This turns the special characters into boxes and question marks.  I need to get the MS Word doc into Excel as a data frame with 2 columns person, dialogue without destroying the special characters , , , , , , etc..p  pI can do this by subbing out in Word with replace but again if I could get it to Excel doing this in R would be much easier.p  pHere is a sample MS Word doc of what my data looks like tab separated columnsp  pa hrefhttpsdl.dropbox.comu61803503TEST.doc relnofollowhttpsdl.dropbox.comu61803503TEST.docap  pExcel and Word versions 2010 on a Win 7 machine.p

Negative 10580 pI am currently looking to write a web app in HTML5. It is my first HTML5 web app. p  pThe main feature of this app is its offline feature. When I mean offline, it will be something like CAPPindex.html for Windows , and it will be the same thing for Mac. So with that said, I have been looking into LocalStorage, WebSQL, IndexedDB. p  pAnd I come to this conclusion that LocalStorage is not going to be good enough for the web app that I am going to write. The IndexedDB only for all the major browsers except safari. Safari desktop amp iOS supports WebSQL not IndexedDB. And then I found out that WebSQL is not going to be supported.p  pSo I am wondering if there is a universal solution to my dilemma Or Should I have code IndexedDB and WebSQL so that it will work on all the browsers Any suggestions are welcome.p
Negative 10580 pIs there a way to search for a JavaScript attribute e.g. a named function in the currently live object model what Firebug displays on the DOM tab, I couldnt find a direct equivalent in the Chrome Developer Tools of the currently loaded page, using the common developer tools of the main browsersp  pAn example would be that I search for beta and the developer tools show me something like codewindow.alpha.betacode, meaning that some script file has created an object named alpha on the window object, which has an attribute beta.p  pI explicitly do emnotem want to search for strings in all script files e.g. codeCtrlShiftFcode in the strongChrome Developer Toolsstrong.p  pThe use case is that I want to call a function of the page from an extensionuserscript. I know the function exists, but it is created using a complex framework and I cant tell where in the pages object model it ends up.p  pPS Terminologyrelated edits of the question are welcome.p

Negative 10580 pI have a page that is created completely using Knockout.  In one of the templates, clicking on a link will display a JQuery Datepicker control to select a date.  Upon selecting the date, a function executes using the selected date and the Datepicker closes.  That much works just fine.p  pIt can take several seconds from when someone selects a date until the Datepicker closes.  This is due to a function that is called LoadAppointmentTimeSlots which needs to run synchronously and can take a while to do what it does.  To address this, I would like a DIV to appear that provides feedback to the user that the system is working loading.p  pTHE PROBLEM is that the DIV does not appear until after the LoadAppointmentTimeSlots function executes by which time the DIV gets hidden again.

Negative 10580 pSo, please bear with me as I have a long question here, I have some code in java that is using an array list to implement a stack. I need to be able to enter the command push to add stuff to the stack. However my problem is that it has to be in the format pushSTUFF.p  pWhere the STUFF is anything, upper case, lower case, string, int, etc.. The way Ive been trying to implement this is with the string split method where PUSH is the delimiter. Then the command is passed to a switch case.p  pI quickly realized that the split gets discarded, at least as far as I can tell, and that the switch case is getting pushSTUFF not push as the case input.p  pIn contemplating this problem I came up with a couple of ways I could do this. I just dont know if they are possible or how to do them. p  pSo,p  ol lipIs there a way to split a string like pushSTUFF and keep both parts the push and the STUFFpli lipIs there a way to split, from a string, something of unknown length or contents since I dont know what the user will input the STUFF is unknownpli lipIs there a way to tell the switch case to look for the pushSTUFF as opposed to just push again because STUFF is unknown.pli ol  pAre any of these even possible to do If so what would you recommendp  pIm sure there are better ways but as Im still learning java these seemed like the best for right now. Also I didnt post any code because I didnt feel it was necessary to the question. I will post some if you need it though. Just ask and I will be happy to oblige.p  ptldr Is it possible to do any of 1, 2, or 3 above and if so how Thanks in advance.p

Negative 10580 pI have got two problems of using pROC package to plot the ROC curve.p  pstrongA.strong The Significance level or Pvalue is the probability that the observed sample Area under the ROC curve is found when in fact, the true population Area under the ROC curve is 0.5 null hypothesis Area  0.5. If P is small Plt0.05 then it can be concluded that the Area under the ROC curve is significantly different from 0.5 and that therefore there is evidence that the laboratory test does have an ability to distinguish between the two groups.p  pTherefore, I would like to  calculate whether a certain area under the ROC curve differs from 0.50 significantly.

Negative 10580 pJust wondering if there is any tool to see what Style is setting a property value for a control. In our application, all the RadComboBoxes have codeIsEditablecode property set to true. There is some DLL that we are using is causing this. I am guessing there is some codeStylecode without a codeKeycodefor the RadComboBox that sets this.p  pIn WPF Inspector, I can see that every RadComboBox control in our App has codeIsEditablecode set to codeTruecode. And under the Resources section there are a bunch of resources that show up, and some of these are set inside some external DLLs that we include in our project.p  pI would like to know what particular Style is causing this, so that we can narrow down our problem.p

Negative 10580 pWhat path are the current C compilers taking to implement the C11 regular expressions libraryp  pAs I understand it, generating code which implements a deterministic finite state machine recognising a particular regular expression is the easiest way to do it but, presumably, that would imply either that the compiler itself would have to parse function calls to the library in a nonstandard way i.e. by implementing them directly or that some kind of polymorphic trickery is at play within the library code itself the kind of thing that I dont emthinkem is possible in C.p  pAre they using some alternative, smarter pure C method Seems like it would be complicatedp

Negative 10580 pThis post is intended to start a deeper discussion on Single Page Applications for the web. There are questions that do not seem to have a clear answer in most resources on the subject. They are in my mindp  ol liAuthorization and authentication. With entire web app being on the client, it may make calls to the server in any of its functions, even those that the user does not have rights to.  The fact that the user cannot see a menu, does not preclude that person from invoking java script functions.  This is easily handled in MVC app, for example, by using controllers that validate user rights to a specific function based on a cookie for example.  However, some SPA apps just use single controller with Breeze or Web Api, which make authorization server side impossible.li liMemory management on the client For small sample apps this is not an issue, but imagine an app with 100s of screens or an app with a single screen that pulls thousands of records over the course of one day.  With persistent caching one could imagine large memory issues, especially on underpowered devices with little RAM, like phones or tablets.  How can a group of developers had SPA route without a clear vision of handling memory managementli liThree Tier deployment Some IT departments will never allow applications with a connection string to a database located on front end web servers.  Every SPA demo I have seen is structured exactly like that, including Breeze or Web Api for that matter.li liUnobtrusive validation. It would require developers to use MVC partial views and controllers instead of just HTML files, which seems to fly in the face of SPA concepts, while it provides a very robust way to easily incorporate validation and UI to support it into web applications.li liExposing primary integer based keys in the url.br This is nonno  in OWASP. As a result, SPA applications seem to target areas with few security requirements and small feature sets.  What do you thinkli ol  pThanks.p

Negative 10580 pWe have a HTML5 based web application which needs a GPS position at irregular interval up to days. The application gets a position quickly when used on land, where there are fixed wifi hotspots or, depending on the platform used, cell towers. p  pHowever offshore where the application is often used, the only data connection is via a Mobile WIFI hotspot. It suffers from an unacceptable delay getting any position at all, presumably because it is acquiring the GPS almanac via the GPS satellite, rather than through the data connection.p  pIn the same environment, dedicated Apps such as Google Maps come up with a position with only a brief delay. And in fact, running our Web page subsequent to activating the Google Maps App, it works finep  pThis is similar to another question here, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12646477gpsonapponlyworksafterusinggooglemapsGps On App only works after Using Google Mapsa, but the solution suggested there is only available as an App, not HTML5p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 10580 pI attempting a scatter plot with many points  150. The goal is to distinguish points at certain areas of the graph.

Essentially, Im looking for something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBoI20.png altenter image description herep  pEach unique point should be a mix of the colours of the respective scales. What I have tried so far is a scatter plot using ggplot. Ive tried setting the colour attribute, but that assigns its own coordinates. It also doesnt work with a limitation I have in that I have to create separate plots of the scatter plot in short, zoomed in plots of the topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright. If I set the xlim and ylim to my own liking for the additional plots, all I get is a crop which results in some cutouts of other points and their texts on the edges of the plot. I cant simply create a separate plot as I need the points to be the same colour on my overall plot and the more specific plots singular colours.p  precodepngimage.png, width  2000, height  1500, res  85 ggplotXY lt ggplotscatterPlotData, aesxx, yy, colourlabels, labellabels  geompoint  geomtexthjust0, vjust0 ggplotXY dev.off codepre  pCurrent overall plotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBvw8L.png altenter image description herep  pCurrent plot of zoomed in bottomleftp  precodepngimage.png, width  2000, height  1500, res  85 ggplotXY lt ggplotscatterPlotData, aesxx, yy, colourlabels, labellabels  geompoint  geomtexthjust0, vjust0  coordcartesianxlimc0,100, ylimc0, 2.5 ggplotXY dev.off codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3egOD.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, some of the points are clipped and arent ommitted.

An order will have an ID and there will be an instrument type associated with it. The orders can also have some events attached to it, like say add, update or remove. If its an update event, then there will not be an instrument type attached with the order, but the order id will be same. For ex if I have an order for instrument xyz with order id 100, later on I can get an event to update the order which has an id 100 by 20, and there will not be an instrument type present with that event order. p  pOnce I receive an order, I need to build an order book for unique instruments, for example instrument xyz should contain all recieved orders for it inside the orderbook.p  pMy question is how efficiently can I store this and what kind of data structure should I use for itp  pAn Order looks something like thisp  precodepublic class Order    public OrderAction add, int id, string instrument, int price  codepre  pAn Orderbookp  precodepublic class OrderBook   public string Instrument public ListltOrdergt AllOrders  codepre  pstrongOption 1strongp  pUpdate a codeDictionaryltint,OrderBookgtcode when I receive an order, with key as order id, and create an order book for the instrument.p  pstrongIssuestrong This will take care of the update events, I can check whether the order already exists, and then update the order book. However an instrument type should only have one order book, and this condition is violated here, as for instrument xyz there could be multiple Add orders coming through, and also makes the manipulation difficult.p  pstrongOption 2strongp  pUpdate a dictionary of codeDictionaryltOrderBook, Listltintgtgtcode, with values as the order ids.p  pstrongIssuestrong This will take care of the above issue, however when I get an update event, Ill have to check through every list of values i.e list of order ids to see whether the order exists already, since the instrument type is going to be empty and I cannot look by the OrderBook key.p  pOrders are coming down at real time, and the operation for storing and retrieving has has to be bit more efficientif not O1 then Ologn, is there a better way to structure this pleasep  pstrongNOTEstrong An OrderBook is an aggregation of all orders for an instrument and will be unique for the instrument. An order will be for an instrument for a particular price, and there will be many orders for the same instrument. strongI get the orders along with the event from someone elsea third party lib, and Im responsible for building the orderbook.strongp

Negative 10580 pIm plotting data using the command files discussed here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18878163gnuplotcontourlinecolorsetstylelineandsetlinetypenotworkinggnuplot contour line color set style line and set linetype not workinga I want to provide different output options. PNG works well, as does the wxt terminal, however, these have fixed resolution, e.g. when I zoom in on the plot it gets grainier.p  pIf I use pdf or pdfcairo for the terminal, the resulting file has a Moire pattern. The region in the image over which the Moire pattern is observed can be reduced by using increasing amounts of interpolation in the pm3d command. There are lots of points in the data set in the radial direction, but not many angular sets of data, so I need to interpolate more in that direction. Using no interpolation results in a very grainy pm3d image, so I have been trying 0,20 to 20,20 or even 20,40. Unfortunately even lots of interpolation does not completely get rid of the Moire pattern, makes the file size HUGE e.g. the PNG file is around 250kB but the pdf file is over 11MB and as a result it renders very slowly. Ive tried viewing these with Adobe Acrobat Reader 10.1.8 and GSview and the result is the same.p  pI am interested in using the pdf format because it is ubiquitous and can be zoomed in without excessive loss of detail unlike PNG.p  pBelow are a couple of screen shots that I captured of the pattern in the resulting pdf output at different levels of interpolation. The first image is the png file for reference as it shows no Moire pattern, 250kB file size.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIxIif.png altPNG rendering  no Moire patternp  pNext, the pdf output without pm3d interpolation, 72kB file size img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commdKkd.jpg altPDF output screenshot.

Negative 10580 pSo, this is a question where Im basically wondering if its possible, and if so, how to do it. I want to write a screen capture program that I can run before starting X, if I so choose, because I want it to capture what is drawn on screen directly, at the lowest level possible. If this is possible, I want you to tell me how, and if it is not I want you to tell me why it is not. For instance, I would want it to be able to record from before I start X and as well after I have started it not necessarily in one go, but so it works both ways.p  pAlso, if you dont know or only have partanswers, I accept them too. Preferably with something I can google. I dont know many terms when it comes to how the process goes from calculation to drawing. So, it would be very nice if you can help me in any way possible. And I hope this question qualifies. Ive checked a few questions like these before and tried to google stuff but it usually just gives me links to download software already written or people in need of help to fix their code.

I thought that it is possible to bind regular functions to the template parameters of codeoperatorcode, but compiler reports the errorp  precodecomposingFunc.cpp11.cpp In function int main composingFunc.cpp11.cpp2812 error invalid operands of types intint and intint to binary operator    coutltltfg5ltltendl codepre  pDo you have any idea how to solve this issue Using template parameters in codeoperatorcodeis not mandatory  if you have some other approach simply suggest here.p  pHere is the source codep  precodeincludeltiostreamgt includeltfunctionalgt  using namespace std  int fint n   return 2n   int gint n   return n1   functionltintintgt operatorfunctionltintintgt f, functionltintintgt g     return []int x return fgx   templatelttypename Tgt functionltintintgt operatorconst T ampf, const T ampg    functionltintintgt f1f,f2g this is encapsulated here so it is not                                 necessary to repeat the same in main                                  for every functional composition   return []int x return f1f2x   int main    functionltintintgt f1f, f2g I want to encapsulate this step into operator   coutltltf1f25ltltendl this works well   coutltltfg5ltltendl error in this line  codepre  pstrongEDITstrong Solution given by Zac uses a class type for one of function arguments it is mandatory, by the standard, to use at least one enum or class type argument in operator overloads and a template type argument.

It works fine when Im clicking on a product and display its detail. But what if I want to inject another view into the right side such as a form How can insert some kind of partial into this product layout The thing is, I dont want to have to write all my different view into the same file for maintainability purpose.p  pHope I was clear.

Negative 10580 pIve started to do some programming using J2EE and I have a few questions in my projectp  pI have an index.jsp, a view.jsp and a servlet.p  pIn the index.jsp when the user click a button it sends a POST to the servlet, which gets some data from the  database and does some calculations, and then redirects using RequestDispatcher to the view.jsp to show the results.p  pIs this a good practice I mean if I had to display different kind of info on different JSPs, would creating a servlet for each view jsp be the way to go p  pIf I had to pass some info from the index.jsp to the view.jsp, would I have to pass the info to the servled and then on the servlet set the request attributes with the data obtained from the request parameters p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 10580 pThe task is to find all possible combinations of strongn1strong operators ,, in strongnstrongnumber A so the reslut of expression equals number B. Expression is calculated from left to right. For examplep  precodeWe have number A123 and B5  1235 codepre  pI guess that this task may be connected with some usage of polish notation and Parsers. So it is smth like I get number 123, make it string 3 2 1 and then try all possible combinations of operators with it like 3 2 1   3 2 1   3 2 1   3 2 1   etc and check if it equals 5. But problem is that I dont really understand how to find all combinations properly. Also I wrote function that makes string from number an function that calculates expression e.g. 3 2 1  .p  precodeexprCounting  String gt Integer exprCounting  head . foldl stackAnalyzing [] . words    where     stackAnalyzing xyss   xyss     stackAnalyzing xyss   yxss     stackAnalyzing xyss   xyss     stackAnalyzing   ss  number  read number  ss  toWordString  Integer gt String                toWordString  addSpace . show   where     addSpace []  []     addSpace xxs  [x]     addSpace xs codepre  pSo can anyone give me advices about the way to resolve this task or what instrument i should use. p

Negative 10580 pI am creating a gift card function where customers can purchase multiple quantities of gift cards with different denominations. For example, they can buy 1 x 50 gift card and  or 3 x 100 gift cards, etc, where code3code is the codegcardqtycode and 100 gift card is the codegcardnamecode. Each denomination is also linked to a codeproductidcode.p  pThe shopping cart function stores each codeproductidcode and its codegcardqtycode as one row in a MySQL database, along with a unique code and some other data price etc. However when I send the gift card details via email, I need ALL the gift cards to display with their own unique code. This means 3 x 100 gift cards need to be displayed three times, with an amended code, so that they can be redeemed separately.p  pHere is what I have so far to loop through the records and display each rowp  precodewhilerow  mysqlfetcharrayresult      gcid  row[gcardid]     for i  0 i lt countgcid i          name  row[productname]         price  row[productprice]         cardcode  row[gcardid]         detailsofgiftcards . name .  ltstronggtCode  . cardcode . ltstronggtltbr gt       codepre  pOn echoing codedetailsofgiftcardscode, naturally I only get one unique code per gift card value as belowp  blockquote   pGift Card 100.00 Value Code 2000478282p      pGift Card 50.00 Value Code 2000478283p blockquote  pWhat I want is to automatically add a dash and a digit onto the end of the unique code for each individual card and display each card as a separate product, such asp  blockquote   pGift Card 100.00 Value Code 20004782821p      pGift Card 100.00 Value Code 20004782822p      pGift Card 100.00 Value Code 20004782823p      pGift Card 50.00 Value Code 20004782831p blockquote  pIf there is only one gift card of that value, display code and code1code, otherwise display multiple records of the same row and concatenate with incremented values.p  pI think I need to start with something likep  precode foreachrows as row       fori  0 i lt row[gcardqty] i                     codepre  pAnd then I get completely lost.p
Negative 10580 pThis is a strange one and I hope that someone can at least give me a direction to look in.p  pMy Android application uses GoogleMap API v2.  In the app, I run an activity off OnClickInfoWindowListener on one of the markers.  In detail, when I click on the particular marker, an InfoWindow of that marker appears.  Next when I click on the InfoWindow, it launches another activity.p  pThe problem is that when I return to GoogleMap from that activity, the particular marker which launched the activity, is not responsive.  By responsive, I mean when I click on it, I do not get an InfoWindow.  There is no such problem with the other markers.  To fix the problem, I either move or zoom on the map or click on another marker to show its InfoWindow, then the original marker works normally.  I cannot see any red stuff on the LogCat.p  pI also run the map off a ListView and there is no problem that I can see.p  pAny suggestions on what to look at are very welcomep  pEdit 1 p  pThis part is the InfoWindowClickListener setup ...p  precode         Set up info Window Click Listener         googleMap                 .setOnInfoWindowClickListenernew OnInfoWindowClickListener                       Override                     public void onInfoWindowClickMarker mkr                           Default open file                          menu option  edit file information                          menu option  delete                         Log.dTAG, InfoWindow Click detected.                         final GeoFileData gfd  getFromHashMapmkr                          if editGeoFile                              editGeoFile  false                              editFileInfogfd                          else if deleteGeoFile                              deleteGeoFile  false                              deleteFilegfd, mkr                          else                               openFilegfd                                                                 codepre  pThe openFile routine which launches the Activityp  precode Public and Routines used by the main loop private void openFile GeoFileData gfd       int typeIndex  gfd.getTypeIndex      switchtypeIndex          case 0          case 1          case 2          case 3               Spen file by default             Intent notePadIntent  new IntentgetBaseContext, NotePad.class             Bundle b  new Bundle             b.putParcelableMAINNOTEPADGFD, gfd             notePadIntent.putExtrasb              startActivityForResultnotePadIntent, SPENNOTEPADCODE              break         default              Log.wTAG, Unknown file.

So far I create each level randomly, using a percentage of different kind of platforms that I wantp  pf.e.p  ul liLevel 1 100 stable platformsli liLevel 2 80  stable platforms, 20 breaking platformsli liLevel X 40  stable, 10 stable but dissolve after jump, 10 stable but moving, 20 breaking, 10 exploding, 10 moving vertical  etc.li ul  pRight now, I create the right amount of each kind, shuffle them, then I loop through the list to catch any inconsistencies. Like if theres two breaking platforms after each other and I cant jump from one to the other. I also place objects on platforms to jump higher.  If theres an object, the following  platform should be farther apart.p  pIt all works but its simply hacked together and gets more complicated the more things I want to add.p  pIs there a way to solve this with A.I. Something where I could have a set of rules and it would generate a random platformobject combination respecting those rules Can somebody point me into the right directionp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOne case I dont see the state machine solution working is, when I create the formation stable, cracked, stable and I cant reach platform 3 from 1. Then I would have to add a spring to platform 1 but when creating the first platform I dont have any knowledge about the next state. Any ideasp  pLets say Im in a state and have 3 different transition options what are the transitions in my case Would I have to pick the next state randomly and check if thats an option according to my percentagesp  pCarlos you saidthe collection of objects, that can be sorted into categories, so the rules could be categoryoriented.  what do you mean by that p

Negative 10580 pThe user provides command line arguments that are used to compute the number of partitions, and the number of threads, where each thread does a minimum linear search of a specific partition of the large array. Each minimum value found by a thread is stored inside a small global array. The main function then does a minimum linear search of the small array, and also a minimum search of the large array and confirms that the minimum found in both small and large array are equal. The problem that I am encountering is that the minimums inside the small global array are sometimes garbage, and sometimes matches the minimum found in the large array.

Negative 10580 pI am planning on writing an application that saves a fair amount of data.  Historically, I have simply written data directly to a server, and only used some simple keyvalue storage with shared preferences for local storage.p  pI am considering this time, instead, using SQLite to save the information at first, and sync the data to the server in the background later.  This will benefit the user in a few ways 1 can use the app offline 2 dont have to worry about data being saved right away, it happens when ever it can 3 more reliability.p  pMy approach will be to getset data from SQLite during UI usage, and use a background process to find new rows and put them on the server, flagging them as synced when it happens.p  pDoes this sound reasonable p
Negative 10580 pI have the following problem I want to have constants, defining the order of a subviews in codeparentView.subviewscode array.

If I dop  precodeview2.layer.zPosition  VIEW2INDEX view1.layer.zPosition  VIEW1INDEX codepre  pthan the display order of subviews changes, but tap handling order and codeparentView.subviewscode array remains unchanged, so I see codeview1code at the top, tap on it, but this tap is handled by codeview2code, which is not what I expect.p  pSo I need to change display order and event handling order simultaneously.p  pMy best idea is to use code, that sets new zPosition alway together with code, that changes subviews arrayp  precodeview2.layer.zPosition  0 NSUInteger index  [parentView.subviews indexOfObjectview2] [parentView exchangeSubviewAtIndex0 withSubviewAtIndexindex] codepre  pBut this doesnt seems to be the best solution.p  hr  pOther idea was to use code[parentView insertSubviewatIndex]code instead of code[parentView addSubview]code, but than I would need to make sure that Im inserting views in proper order, which is a little tiresome, as I have about 15 views being created in different places. p  hr  pSo here is finally the question is there a way to solve the problem, described in the beginningp

Negative 10580 pIm building SDL2 static library. To use it in my program, I have to link with static SDL2.lib, but also with winmm.lib, imm32.lib, version.lib, which I assume are stubs for some Windows DLLs. My main goal is to create such a version of static SDL2, so that my program wont have to be linked with those other 3 .libs. I would like to have all the symbols needed in the static library, so that I have to link the exe only with SDL2.lib. Im using MS VS2012. I had the idea to use the Librarian when building the static SDL2.lib so I added those other 3 libs to LibrarianAdditional Dependencies. That worked like a charm. My exe has to be linked only against SDL2.lib.p  pBut when the .lib was linked, I got warningsp  precodewarning LNK4221 This object file does not define any previously undefined public symbols, so it will not be used by any link operation that consumes this library  imm32.libIMM32.dll    SDL2main warning LNK4221 This object file does not define any previously undefined public symbols, so it will not be used by any link operation that consumes this library  version.libVERSION.dll    SDL2main codepre  pNow my idea is this imm32.lib and version.lib do not define any previously undefined in SDL2.lib symbols. So they are not needed, because all of the symbols in SDL2.lib can be resolved. So I removed those 2 libs from the Librarian and recompiled SDL2.lib. Now when Im linking my exe against it, I got some unresolved symbols possibly from those 2 removed .libs. p  pCould somebody explain to me the meaning of those warnings And how to avoid themp

How should I do that I wrote some code but it probably doesnt make sensep  precodeSYSEXIT  1 EXITSUCC  0 SYSWRITE  4 SYSCALL  0x80 SYSREAD  3  .data value .space 5, 0 valuelen .long .value  result .long resultlen .long .result  .text .global start  start   movl SYSREAD, eax movl EXITSUCC, ebx movl value, ecx movl valuelen, edx int SYSCALL  movl 0, edx movl valuelen, ecx  for                                 movb value, edx, 1, al     subb 48, al     movb al, result, edx, 1     inc edx     loop for      add 10, result  movl 0, edx movl resultlen, ecx  for1                                movb result, edx, 1, al     add 48, al     movb al, result, edx, 1     inc edx     loop for1  movl SYSWRITE, eax             movl SYSEXIT, ebx  movl result, ecx movl resultlen, edx int SYSCALL  movl SYSEXIT, eax movl EXITSUCC, ebx int SYSCALL codepre  pI dont know if I should reserve memory by spaces Or reading characters in loop How to convert it, to be able to make some math operation and then convert it to be able to display it I know that to get the value of ASCII char I should subtract 48, but what next I had an idea to multiply each bits by 2k where k is 0,1,2...n its good idea If so, how to implement something like this p  pAs you can see I had a lot of questions, but I only need to someone show me how to do, what I am asking about. I saw some similar problems, but nothing like this in Linux. p  pThank you in advance for the all information. All the best.p

Negative 10580 pI have seen many questions on SO regarding the disposal of a BackgroundWorker in a Windows Forms application, and it appears that the consensus is that they do not need to be manually disposed in most situations.  However, I have a question regarding how to handle a UserComponent that is being disposed when a BackgroundWorker is actually running. codeIsBusycode returns true  Should this situation be handled in any particular wayp  pFor example I have a UserControl panellike object that a user can enter settings information.  It contains a BackgroundWorker in it that saves a users configuration.  When the panel looses focus Leave event it spins up the BackgroundWorker if its not already running to save the configuration to file if a change is detected.  Since the Leave event may also be the user changing to another screen this panel will now be disposed.  If the BackgroundWorker is still running do I need to handle this in the Dispose method of the UserComponent itselfp

Negative 10580 pI am newbie to Python, and I am trying to use pexpect, interested in the inputoutput filter of interact. But I can not figure out how to use the filter.p  pOn the documentation of Pexpect, regarding interact method, it is mentioned thatp  precodeinteractescapecharacterx1d, inputfilterNone, outputfilterNone  This gives control of the child process to the interactive user the human at  the keyboard. Keystrokes are sent to the child process, and the stdout and stderr  output of the child process  is printed. This simply echos the child stdout and child  stderr to the real stdout and it echos the real stdin to the child stdin. When the  user types the escapecharacter this method  will stop. The default for  escapecharacter is ]. This should not be confused with ASCII 27   the ESC  character. ASCII 29 was  chosen for historical merit because this is the character used by telnet as the  escape character. The escapecharacter will not be sent to the child process.  You may pass in optional input and output filter functions. These functions should  take a string and return a string. The outputfilter will be passed all the output  from the child process. The inputfilter will be passed all the keyboard input from  the user. The inputfilter is run BEFORE the check for the escapecharacter. codepre  pBut there is no any example how to use the input or output filter. The only thing it  mentioned is, These functions should take a string and return a string.p  pFor example, if I want to append aaa to each user input, how can I do it what the filter should bep  precodedef myinputstr     return str  aaa ... ... c.interactinputfilter codepre  pThanks in advance.p

If I refresh the page, it properly updates, and then everything works ok again for a few hours.  Then it reverts back to the old CSS file, and I have to manually refresh it again.  I have no idea where this cached version is being stored or why its replacing the updated version.  This has been going on for over a week, and Ive restarted both the browser and MAMP with no luck.

Negative 10580 pI have a program with multiple tabs, so when I go to a new tab I want to somehow temporarily get rid of all of the elements on the other tabs until the user returns to that certain tab.

Negative 10580 pIm developing a newer web application that sometimes needs to load parts of a legacy application via CGI in order to complete various legacy operations. Whenever that needs to happen, I just populate the legacy document into a temporary iframe until the user completed whatever it was needed for. emBTW, bear in mind the newer app must not allow popups, multiple windowstabs, etc.emp  pBut, sometimes, the iframes legacy document wants to use a popup window. So, Ive devised a way to override the legacys codewindow.opencode command with a type of modal dialog containing another iframe. This works great....p  pBut my problems arise whenever the popups formbased document emnow loaded in the modal dialogs iframeem tries to manage its state. Upon initial load, its form autosubmits to get the latest DB data... after CGI responds with a new document, the user can make a selection. Upon selection, the form once again submits to CGI, which responds with a small JavaScript that injects their selection data to the codeopenercode window.p  pMy first issue was with the reference to codeopenercode, since theres effectively not one anymore as far as the legacy code is concerned. Ive kindof solved that by defining my modal iframes codecontentWindow.openercode to be my legacy documents iframes window the first iframe I mentioned.p  pHOWEVER, when the modal documents form submits, STATE GETS LOST and my codeopenercode definition is reset to codenullcode. Therefore, when the user makes their selection in the modals iframe, the legacy code cannot return any value through the codeopenercode reference.p  pSo, my question is complicated, but basically...br Is there a way to save a window.opener reference such that it doesnt get lost whenever that window updates I know JavaScriptDOM is kind of pass by reference but Im worried Im overengineering at this point or something.p  pAny ideas Tipsbr Anyone do anything similarp

I tried disabling precompiled headers since I am not using it, but the problem still exists. I can clean and rebuild every time, but it is very timeconsuming since the project is relatively large.p

Negative 10580 pIve been tasked with adding seeds to an existing Rails project.

Negative 10580 pThis question builds on the correct answer provided to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25015262howtocorrectlyupdatethetextvalueofaninputelementinad3jstransitionthisa. I simply havent been able to get any further..p  pWith the help of an interpolator function, d3.jss tween allows smooth graphical transition between existing and new ie to be set DOM element values. At the simplest level, for a given animation we have a target element, an start state, an end state, a transition, a tween function and an interpolator.p  pNow, say I want every so often to programmatically update the contents of an input text field element. The value to be entered is noninterpolable either the text is submitted, or it is not. There is no inbetween state. In providing a closure allowing for text retrieval at the scheduled transition time, tween would seem to be a good vehicle for the updates. Either I replace the interpolator with a fixed value, ensure the start and end values are identical, or find some other way of forcing it to fire at t1. Thats the theory..p  pTo this end, in my case each property not value is modified in its own update call, into which are passed transition, element index and parent element selection.p  pFirst cutp  ul lipan outer, governing transition with delay values staggered using a multiple of the current elements indexp  precode    playbacktransition  d3.transition     .delayfunctiond, i,  j          return timeinterval  i          .durationfunction          return 1  the minimum      codepreli lipwithin a call to playbacktransition.each pass the transition as a parameter to a dependent animation by means of an update interfacepli lipwithin this dependent animation, apply the transition and tween to the current elementsp  precode    input                         a UI dialog element     .transition     .tweeni.toString, setChordname waveplot.chordname  codepreli ul  pWherep  precode        function setChordnamenewValue              return function                  var i  newValue             a string                 return functiont                      this.value   i                     inputChanged.callthis                                        codepre  pandp  precode        function inputChanged            if this.value return            try              var chord  chordify.chordObjFromChordNamethis.value             purge                          rid display of superceded elements             plotChordchord, options        calculate amp draw chord using new input property            catch e              console.loge.toString                     codepre  pstrongPROBLEMstrongp  pWhile setChordname always fires each chord is in turn correctly found and its value stored, of the scheduled returned functions, only the first fires and results in display of the associated waveform.

I have 5 classes maybe Ill have more with similar methods. The whole difference is that each mapper has some model, all of them extend ModelMyAbstractClass.br If indeed there is no way of doing this, the only solutions left are make an interface for each of them, with the only differences being the params not DRY at all.br Check in each of the functions if the ModelMyAbstractClass is instance of ModelMyClass needed and throw an error  which seems like a silly strategy since I should be requiring explicitly the needed type of parameter.p

This form excludes the user field so the user cannot change it himself. p  precode  class Meta     model  Server     exclude  [user,name, quirky] codepre  pInstead the value of the user field will be put in after I call .savecommitFalse.p  precodeif neuerserverform.haschanged and neuerserverform.isvalid   neuerserver  neuerserverform.savecommitFalse   neuerserver.user  request.user   neuerserver.name  slugifyneuerserver.name   neuerserver.save codepre  pBecause of that the user field is excluded from validation. Now there is a uniquetogether between the user field and another char field.p  precode  class Meta     uniquetogether  user, name, codepre  pBecause the user field is excluded there will be no validation for the uniquetogether. So when saving the instance there can be an IntegrityError. p  pstrongWhere Im stuckstrong So my first Idea was to check the db if the CharField already exists and if so just change it by adding a number and check again. But if I do this counting upwards an attacker might insert a lot of similar strings so my server has to do this checking indefinitely long. p  pstrongPossible Solutionsstrong So for me there would be two acceptable solutions Either change the CharFields value to something that definitely does not exist yet without trying a lot first. Or make the validation fail and throw the form back to the user.p  pstrongWhat I triedstrong I think the second would be ideal, but since Im using model formset and cannot pass the request user to the form its not possible for me to do that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2141030djangosmodelformuniquetogethervalidationDjango39s ModelForm uniquetogether validationap  pInstead I was wondering if it was possible to add self made errors to a form while looping through a formset.p  pSomewhat like this pseudo codep  precodefor form in formset.forms   if form.isvalid     servername  form.cleaneddata.getname,     if Server.objects.getuserrequest.user,nameservername.count       formset.forms[form].errors  here is my own error message       formset.forms[form].fields[name].errors  this field is wrong codepre  pAny ideas how to solve that Thank you for help if you read until here p

Negative 10580 pIm developing an application where there are two programs, running at the same time one in C and another in MATLAB.p  pThe C program generates periodically three numerical values as outputs. The MATLAB program needs an access to the three outputs periodically, but in a different period of time.p  pCurrently, Ive solved this using a strongcode.txtcodestrong file. The C writes this file when the routine is done, and the MATLAB reads from it whence it needs.p  pHowever, using strongcodetextscancodestrong command, MATLAB takes around 1.5 ms to read the code.txtcode using a Pentium I54250U. So, I was wondering if there is a faster way to solve this issue.p

Negative 10580 pImagine we have a cassandra cluster with 8 nodes. And we installed 1 million objects and out of that 100 objects are popular.  So, there is a high probability to distribute these 100 objects to all the 8 nodes. This mean that the whole cluster become heavily loaded because of only few popular objects. isnt it  In such a case, increase replication of objects will make huge effect on the system.  Do you think in such a situation, higher degree of replication would downgrade the system performance How the replication factor affect access distributions in such a systemp

Negative 10580 pI have a view lets call it View 1 that allows the user to select a certain table to view using a dropdown menu on a form. That parameter is then passed to my controller. What I want to do is get my controller to take that parameter and use it to change the visibility of elements on the view it directs to View 2. p  pView 2 has 3 tables. Only one table should be visible at any given time once my method in my Controller runs. Currently, all 3 tables have unique IDs and they have a displaynone attribute in the CSS file. So, if the user selects 1 from View 1, I want View 2 to set table 1s display to block and table 2 and 3 to displaynone. Can I do this in the Controller or am I required to do this in JavaScript If I have to do this in JavaScript, how do I pass the parameter value from the controller to the JS function callp

Negative 10580 pI have a server with a public IP, I want to send some UDP Packet data from the server over the WAN to a computer connected behind a router.  I have the public IP of my home connection and I have the public IP of the server, I am also able to get the MAC addresses if necessary.  I am using Windows Sockets for this.  I know this can all be done via port forwarding on the router which I did and everything is working fine, but I want to know how this can be done through C code.p  pApplications like utorrent or Skype are able to send data directly to a PC from the WAN through the router and to my computer without having to port forward.  Just wondering how this is all done.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 10580 pOK. I know this is a FAQ, and I think the answer is give up, it doesnt work that way, but I just want to make sure Im not missing something.p  pI am still wrapping my head around best practices and rules for use of interfaces. I have code in different packages that Id prefer to keep decoupled, something like so doesnt work, or I wouldnt be herep  precodepackage A  type Foo struct   func f Foo Bars []Foo, error      foos  make[]Foo, 0       some loop which appends a bunch of related Foo to foos     return foos, nil  codepre  hr  precodepackage B  type Foolike interface      Bars []Foolike   func DoSomethingf Foolike error       blah  codepre  pWith this, the compiler complainsp  precodecannot use f type A.Foo as type Foolike in argument to B.DoSomething A.Foo does not implement Foolike wrong type for Bars method     have Bars []A.Foo, error     want Bars []Foolike, error codepre  pNow, I grok that []Foolike is emnot an interface signatureem itself its the signature for a slice of Foolike interfaces. I think I also grok that the compiler treats []A.Foo and []Foolike as different things because ... emmumbleem memory allocation, strict typing emmumbleem.p  pMy question is Is there a correct way to do what I ultimately want, which is to let B.DoSomething accept an A.Foo without having to import A and use A.Foo in B.DoSomethings function signature or worse, in the interface definition Im not hung up on trying to trick the compiler or get into crazy runtime tricks. I understand that I could probably change the implementation of Foo.Bars to return []Foolike, but that seems stupid and wrong Why should A have to know anything about B That breaks the whole point of decoupling things.p  pstrikeI guess another option is to remove Bars as a requirement for implementing the interface and rely on other methods to enforce the requirement. That feels less than ideal, though what if Bars is the only exported method.strike Edit No, that wont work because then I cant use Bars in DoSomething, because its not defined in the interface. Sigh.p  pIf Im just Doing It Wrong, Ill accept that and figure something else out, but I hope Im just not getting some aspect of how its supposed to work.p

Negative 10580 pI have a program in WPF which has a datagrid which is bound to a list of wireless devices.  When a signal is detected from a new device, my program automatically adds it to the device list. One of the datagrid columns is a combo box which has a list of the device types. In some cases the user will need to make this selection e.g. left or right channel, and in other cases the value is autofilled when the signal is detected e.g. a device with only one channel. p  pI want to be able to lock the combo box in cases where the user is not to make a selection. Ideally, I would like to simply hide the combo box and change its cell to a text box, but I have not been able to figure out how to do this.p  pAlso, the events DropDownClosed and SelectionChanged for a combobox dont seem to work when the change is not made by the user and the combo box value is automatically chosen based on the objects property.

Any codecode sign in the input is translated as codecode in the email I receive. p  pIf I echo the strings to the screen they show correctly as codecode, but it is when translated to the email that I get codecodep  pThe page is coded as p  precodeltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtmlcharsetutf8 gt codepre  pI have tried the following line, but it makes no difference.p  precodeadvertisementnew  strreplace, amppound, advertisement codepre  pI have trawled Google and this forum but cannot find a solution. I would be grateful if anyone can help me.p  pMany thanksp  pTogp  pThis was, in my humble opinion, unfairly marked as duplicate. I carefully examined the previous question mentioned and although it contained extensive and incomprehensible answers for a newbie like me, I could not find the answer I was looking for. However, thanks to the comment below I searched Google to find out how to set mail headers in php and the following code has worked for mep  precodeheaders   MIMEVersion 1.0 . rn headers .

At the ripe old age of 62 I do try to learn new things but find this forum expects too much of me and other members are too ready to cast judgement and penalise me for my lack of knowledge rather than offering help, which is a shame.p  pBest wishes,p  pTogp

Negative 10580 pI am compiling a C program on linux with gcc. The program itself links libc and not much else at buildtime, so that ldd gives this output p  precode ldd myprogram     linuxvdso.so.1 gt  0x00007fffd31fe000     libc.so.6 gt libx8664linuxgnulibc.so.6 0x00007f7a991c0000     lib64ldlinuxx8664.so.2 0x00007f7a99bba000     libdl.so.2 gt libx8664linuxgnulibdl.so.2 0x00007f7a98fbb000 codepre  pAt runtime this program dlopens library B, which dependes on a library A, which of course dlopen also loads before returning. A exports a function called reexec, which B invokes B is linked against A. libc also exports a function called reexec. readelf output p  precode readelf as A.so  grep reexec  104 00000000000044ff   803 FUNC    GLOBAL PROTECTED   11 reexec  469 00000000000044ff   803 FUNC    GLOBAL PROTECTED   11 reexec   readelf as libx8664linuxgnulibc.so.6  grep reexec  2165 00000000000e4ae0    39 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   12 reexecGLIBC2.2.5 codepre  pThe problem is that when B invokes reexec, the reexec inside libc is called, NOT the reexc inside of A.p  pIf, when I invoke the program, I include LDLIBRARYPRELOADpathtoA.so, then everything works as expected  Bs invocation of reexec correctly calls A, and not libc.p  pThe dlopen call passes RTLDNOW  RTLDGLOBAL. I have tried with and without DEEPBIND, and get the same behavior in either case.p  pI have also tried dlopening A directly, before B, both with and without DEEPBIND, which did not affect the behavior.p  pThe question  is it possible to dlopen AB with higher precedence than libraries that were included at linktime libc, in this case p  pplease dont suggest that I rename the call to something other than reexec  not usefulp

Negative 10580 pI have an MVC Index page inside a Category View. p  pI originally wanted to place a modal popup dialog on the same Index Page with buttons for every record in the list which would trigger an Ajax call to get the data and display the data in the modal popup.p  pWhat I found, for some reason, is that the properties inside the div do not resolve the CategoryDescription property. I also notice that even if I place the LabelFor, EditorFor, and ValidationMessageFor HTML helpers above, right below the DisplayNameFor, they dont resolve. If I change it to a DisplayNameFor, it resolves.p  pSo, what I did, was simply route an Edit and Details in the table where it would execute the GET via the corresponding Controller for the appropriate Action that was clicked on. This way, The Edit.cshtml page has the model data to display in the same exact modal popup form which gets resolved. This methodology works fine.p  pI was just wondering though, why couldnt the model properties be resolved in the Index page within the popup formp  pIm placing the code here below.

Negative 10580 pI just received an email this morning that testflightapp.com will no longer be active as of 2262015, and that I should be using the iTunes Connect TestFlight service instead. This is fine and dandy for app store apps, but most of my projects are enterprise apps, and that is not supported in iTunes Connect. On top of that, iTunes Connect TestFlight requires iOS 8, and a good chunk of Enterprise users are still on iOS 7. p  pDoes anyone have a solution outside of TestFlight for deploying Enterprise iOS apps to a set of registered users I am hoping there is an easier solution than setting up my own MDM, but at this point I think that may be the only option.p

Prerender.io seems like a good solution to this, but I cannot get it to work for my ReactJS application.p  pCan prerender.io be used with ReactJS If not, is there another good way to improve SEO for my site without doing all the rendering serversidep  pEDIT Upon further digging, I realized that the issue here is that reactrouter uses a  by default, and not a .

Negative 10580 pI am having difficulties filtering a set of data thats returned with coldfusion and using javascriptjquery to filter that data. The only issue I am having is that I have 2 filters available to the user, so if one filter tries to hide those table rows, the other in some cases will display it again. Ive been playing around with the code and looking through the net, but cant find reliable source where several filters are in play. p  pHere is the HTML code, which is being looped in a  nothing special. p  precodeltselect nametermAdjustment idtermAdjustmentgt     ltoption value0gtampnbspltoptiongt     ltcfloop arrayterms indexigt                   ltoption valuei ltcfif termAdjustment EQ igtselectedltcfifgtgti monthsltoptiongt     ltcfloopgt ltselectgt  ltselect multiple namesuppliers idsuppliersgt     ltcfloop arrayname indexigt                    ltoption valueigtiltoptiongt     ltcfloopgt ltselectgt   lttr classoddEven returnedData datatrate.term datasrate.name datarrate.rategt codepre  pIve had several version of javascriptjquery code, but none worked 100. Like Ive used .filter jquery, Ive tried having each filter in their own IF statements, but as I said, none work primarily because I have more than 1 filter. But this is my latest one and frankly, the most complete one. p  precode.returnedData.prophidden, false        .returnedData.eachfunction       if termAdjustment.val  0  suppliers.val          if this.attrdatat  termAdjustment.val              ampamp isInArraythis.attrdatas, suppliers.val              this.attrhidden, false                   else              this.attrhidden, true                 function isInArrayvalue, array  return array.indexOfvalue gt  1   codepre  pp  pSo the only instance where it does not work is where either or is not selected. If I select something for term, it will get into the IF statement, but than suppliers.val is not an array, so it errors. If I select suppliers and leave term blank, it does not return any data because it wouldnt get into the second IF. Ive tried having else if for each case, but maybe I did not do it right.p  pIt would be nice to have a nice bulletproof code  p  pThank you all in advance.p

If I only run one or the other, it throws no error.pli lipI also have a third volley that uses codeStringRequestcode instead of the codeCustomRequestcode and I also get an error when running it with either of the codeCustomRequestscode. Running it alone works fine.pli ol  pIts like there is something wrong with the Volley queue.p

Negative 10580 pWe wrote an unmanaged DLL with  a simple Cstyle API last month. It works and all is fine with it.p  pToday, were writing a demo app using this DLL. This is part of a whole new Solution in Visual Studio 2013.  It compiles and runs fine, until it tries to use the DLLs API, where we get DllNotFoundException.  p  pSame thing happened last week with a test console app. The cheapquick workaround was to copy the DLL from the workspace it was made in, and plop a copy into  binx64Debug in the projects folder in the new workspace.  The problem went away.p  pSure, we could do the same today for the new demo app, and get on with life, but this seems goofy.  We have several test and demo apps, and apps to be given to customers, numbering fifteen or so.  Surely we are not supposed to manually copy the DLL, after every change to it, into fifteen different binx64Debug for fifteen different projects. And more, since well have Release versions too. p  pDespite reading many blogs, articles, MSDN pages about unmanaged DLLs and Solutions and Projects and rightclick to Add References... and all that, Ive not seen any clear explanation how one should deal with multiple projects using one DLL.   Seems like there should be some way we could copy the DLL to one place, and tell all the projects just once to go look there.p  pRelevant Side Question Weve tried the Add References... things, but it didnt like our DLL. Is this not applicable to unmanaged DLLs written in C  We dont see a clear statement whether or not we should be using Add Reference.p

Negative 10580 pIll probably lose reputation for asking this but Ive been trying infinite variations of code, and failing every time. So Im reaching out.p  pIm working on an aspx. Its all built, they just want some additional functionality.p  pWere using a hrefhttpsgithub.comnikhilkscriptsharp relnofollowScriptSharpa to transcompile to JavaScript.p  pBasically, weve got an HTML table. Each row in the table represents an invoice. One column in the table represents the amount due call it codeamountDuecode on the invoice. Another column on the table contains a textbox wherein the user may enter the amount to apply to the invoice call it codeamountToPaycode. If the amounts differ, another column populates with a textbox, prepopulated with the difference between the amount due and the amount entered call it codedifferencecode. Following this column is another column with a dropdown list of reasons to explain the discrepancy call it codereasoncode. The user may change the difference in the codedifferencecode textbox. If that happens, a new additional codedifferencecode textbox and a new additional codereasoncode dropdown list need to appear on the same row of the table, each under its appropriate column.p  pMy first attempts duplicated controls geometrically, for example, going from two codedifferencecode textboxes to eight. I figured that out.p  pNow every combination of jQuery functions I try either duplicates all the controls, or none of the controls. So, on codedifferencecode change, either no new codedifferencecode textbox is added, or the number of codedifferencecode textboxes that exist is added. So if two exist, four result. If four exist, eight result.p  pOkay, heres some code.p  pHere are the two columns for codedifferencecode and codereasoncode.p  precodelttd classcurrencygt     ltdivgt         ltinput classdifferencetextbox typetext value0.00 styledisplay none gt     ltdivgt lttdgt lttdgt     ltdivgt         ltselect styledisplay none classadjreasonselectgt             ltoptiongtltoptiongt         ltselectgt     ltdivgt lttdgt codepre  pIll skip the ScriptSharp and just list the transcompiled JavaScript debug versionp  precode Let this function represent the function called on difference change.

Negative 10580 pso I am having an issue with how to work with some addressing in 6502. Basically, I have 3 values that I want to represent the 12 bit address space of a pixel on the monitor of the 6502. I have built the address elements with some simple modding. However, I am not quite sure where to go from here. Lets say I have a goal address of 05ff, the bottom right pixel. What I currently have is the first bit, which would be added to 0200, the second bit, and the third bit, but no idea how to build up a 12 bit quantity from these. Can anyone offer assistance My teacher kind of left us out to dry other than lectures and the obelisk site, which is still a bit over my head as far as using it to figure out what to do. Does anybody know how I can do thisp  pCurrently, for the address 05ff, what I have is a 3, an f, and an f. I know I can just bit shift to get the second f to move over, but I am not sure how to add the 0200 to the 0300 to produce the quantity 0500, which would then be added to the 00ff. p

What happens is the followingp  pEverything is normal until and including codemidiStreamOutcode. I can hear the midi output. The playback length is correct. However, the event callback is never called when the playback ends.p  pAt this point the value of codeMidiHeader.Flagscode is code0xecode, indicating that the stream is still playing even though the callback has been notified with the message that playback has finished. The value of codeMidiHeader.Flagscode should be code9code, indicating that the stream has finished playing.p  pThe call to codemidiOutUnprepareHeadercode fails with the error code code0x41code Cannot perform this operation while media data is still playing.  Reset the device, or wait until the data is finished playing.. Note that resetting the device, as suggested in the error message, does in fact not fix the problem neither does waiting or trying it multiple times.p  pAnother variant that works correctly is if I use codeIntPtrcode instead of coderef MidiHeadercode in the signatures of the C declarations, and then manually allocate unmanaged memory, copying my codeMidiHeadercode structure onto that memory, and then using the allocated memory to call the functions.p  pFurthermore, I tried decreasing the size Im passing to the codeheaderSizecode argument to 32. Since the fields are reserved and, in fact, didnt exist in previous version of the Windows API, they seemed to have no particular purpose anyway. However, this does not fix the problem, even though Windows should not even know that the array exists, and therefore it should not do anything. Commenting out the array entirely yet again fixes the problem i.e., both the array as well as the 8 codeReservedcode fields are commented out, and the codeheaderSizecode is 32.p  pThis hints to me that the codeIntPtr[] Reserved2code cannot be marshaled correctly, and attempting to do so is corrupting other values.

Negative 10580 pI have had asked a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28853364matchingdatafromthreetablesinsqlserver200828855348noredirect1comment4624707328855348herea and have got help from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1175077jpwjpwa who helped me with the query. The situation here remains same but only a bit more detail added. I have four tables. Sample structure for three of them is given below img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNDQHt.png altenter image description herep  pI have been helped to form query which goes as belowp  precodeselect      d.LOTQty,      ApprovedQty  countd.SerialNo,     d.DispatchDate,     Installed  counta.SerialNo  countr.SerialNo from      Despatch d  left join      Activation a       on d.SerialNo a.SerialNo     and d.DispatchDate lt a.ActivationDate      and d.LOTQty  a.LOTQty left join      Replaced r        on d.SerialNo r.SerialNo      and d.DispatchDate lt r.ActivationDate      and a.ActivationDate is null or a.ActivationDate lt d.DispatchDate where      d.LOTQty  15 group by      d.LOTQty, d.DispatchDate, d.STBModel codepre  pFor understanding sake, above query match strongcodeDespatchcodestrong tables codeSerialNocode with strongcodeActivationcodestrong table. If match found it checks for Date difference. If codeDespatchDate lt ActivationDatecode only those numbers are considered while otherswhich didnt match or whose codeDispatchDate gt ActivationDatecode are matched with Replaced with similar date criteria. So at the end we find 9 matches i.e 7 from strongcodeActivationcodestrong and 2 from strongcodeReplacedcodestrong as belowp  precodeLotQty  ApprovedQty  DispatchDate  Installed   15         10        201387       9 codepre  pI want to display two more columns in here i.e strongcodeDOAcodestrong and strongcodeBouncecodestrong like this  p  precodeLotQty  ApprovedQty  DispatchDate  Installed  DOA  Bounce   15         10        201387       9        2     4 codepre  pDOA and Bounce should be calculated with difference between 4th table i.e strongcodeFailedcodestrong tables codeFailedDatecode and the above 9 matched SerialNos respective ActivationRecord datehenceforth termed as actrecdate. strongcodeFailedcodestrong table and Intermediate 9 matched SerialNos structure is shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRisvd.png altenter image description herep  pstrongcodeIntermediatecodestrong table doesnt physically exist. It is just for reference and to provide more clarity. strongcodeIntermediatecodestrong table contain those codeSerialNocode, which were matched with strongcodeActivationcodestrong and strongcodeReplacedcodestrong table. The codeactrecDatecode field is correspondingly matched ActivationRecord Date.  p  ol listrongDOA amp Bouncestrong  We should match all the 9 resultant SerialNosi.e Intermediate table with strongcodeFailedcodestrong table. If matched, calculate difference between codeFailedDatecode and codeactrecdatecode. If difference is strongcode0 to lt10 dayscodestrong then count it under codeDOAcode and if difference is strongcodegt10 days to lt180 dayscodestrong then count it under codeBouncecode. From strongcodeFailedcodestrong we find 6 matches out of which Product1,2 falls in codeDOAcode as difference between actrecDate is 0 and Product7,8,9 amp 10 falls under codeBouncecode as their difference is code89  54  61  61code. So as shown above strongcodeDOA  2codestrong and strongcodeBounce  4codestrongli ol  pI want to build a query which could give me DOA and Bounce as well. I tried creating a temp table and dumping the resultant SerialNos and actrecDate into it. Next I tried to match temp table and Failed table. I couldnt get it working and further more it took around 7 minutes to even execute the query. p  pP.S My Actual tables contain around 50k to 100k data entries.p

Negative 10580 pI tried to use the shelf feature for the first time in IntelliJ IDEA today. I shelved all my current changes so that I could work on a quick bugfix, commit it, and come back to my current work afterwards. p  pWhen I commited the shelf action, IntelliJ created the shelf and I could see it in the tool window. Then it reverted, and reloaded the project. p  pNow the emshelfem tab in the Changes tool window does not appear any more.p  pHowever in the file system I can see the patch file under code.ideashelfcode.p  pWhy  I suspect the problem is that the code.ideacode directory is itself under version control. So when I shelved the changes, it file was included in the shelved changes, and then it was reverted, and IntelliJ is not aware of the shelved changes any more.p  pI am using Git.p  pHow can I make IntelliJ aware of the patch file in the change tool window  Or if impossible how can I restore these changes based on the patch file only p  pAnd how to use this feature in the future without encountering this problem p  pIs it a bad practice to keep the code.ideacode directory in te VCS p

Negative 10580 pA webpage Im working on uses some fancy chevrons for bullet points in a list. Id like to define a list style that scales with the font size of the list items itself doing so is the ultimate end goal of my problem here.p  pWe currently keep those chevrons in SVG files one of which is offered below so they can be magnified without looking terrible. Theyre referenced like thisp  precodeul.foo      liststyleimage url..imageschevron.svg  codepre  pWe use these chevron lists a few times each around the site. Sometimes theyre with large text, sometimes with smaller or normal sized text. Were forced to create a new chevron image for each font size e.g. codechevronsmall.svgcode, codechevronmedium.svgcode, codechevronlarge.svgcode, etc, but surely theres a better way that lets us use just the one image and have it scaled up and down on its own based on the font sizep  pHowever, I havent figured out how to make the image scale with the font size yet.p  pa hrefhttpwww.w3.orgwikiCSSPropertiesliststyleimageThe W3 wiki for liststyleimagea suggests that if the images intrinsic width or height is given as a percentage, then that percentage is resolved against 1em, which sounds like its exactly what we want. I havent worked out how to make this happen though. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma19485375254830Brian Campbells answera to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19484707How can I make an svg scale with its parent containera appears to suggest a way to make this percentage thing happen, but when I set a width or height of 100, the chevron bullet points show up extremely tiny or not at all, even when the font size is large.p  pstrongHow can I make this liststyleimage scale fully with the text size, so that as a ULs text size gets larger, the bullet image does toostrongp  pstrongGlyph fontsstrong We cant use them. Theyd get the job done visually, but they have a bad impact on accessibility because screen readers wont read out the bullets as bullets but as some other weird character. We could define a custom glyph font, possibly, and replace the bullet characters in it with ours, but the file size overhead in doing so would be excessive. As far as I can tell, we need to use an image.p  h1My SVGs codeh1  pThe SVG comes from Illustrator and has this codep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt lt Generator Adobe Illustrator 15.1.0, SVG Export PlugIn .

Negative 10580 pIm building a service that periodically connects to a large number of devices thousands via TCP sockets. These connections are all established at the same time, a couple of api commands are sent through each, then the sockets are closed. All devices are in the same subnet. p  pThe trouble starts after about 1000 devices. New connections are not established. After waiting for a couple of minutes, everything is back to normal. My first guess was that the maximum number of socket connections had been reached and after reading through many similar questions and tutorials, I modified some kernel networking parameters like various cache sizes, max number of open files, codetcptwreusecode, codesomaxconncode. Unfortunately, it had little to no effect. p  pThe problem does not seem to be burstrelated The first time I run the script, it works fine, but when I start it again a couple of minutes later, then I start seeing these errors. My best guess was that the number of open sockets builds up over time, possibly in the codeTIMEWAITcode state. On the other hand, setting the codetcptwreusecode parameter which seems perfect for this scenario did not have any noticeable effect. I close the sockets via pythons socket.close.p  pIt may be important to stress that this question is not about a highload server, but a highload client The connections are outgoing. I saw many serverrelated questions that were answered with the solutions I described above. p
Negative 10580 pWe have an existing web application written in Java. We want to give our users the ability to open a Word document that is stored in our application on the server.  So when the user downloads the document from our server, Word pops up and they then can edit this document on the client.  Once finished editing the document we would like to give them the ability to save this document automatically back to the server where they retrieved it, by simply selecting on the Word Save icon.  Similar to how SharePoint does it.p  pSeems to me SharePoint would be a good solution for this and they do it very well, but unfortunately we cannot use SharePoint in our architecture.  p  pThere also seems to be a lot of serverside possibilities that we can use to upload and open word documents from our server, I feel we can solve these use cases easily.p  pstrongMy big problem is the automatic saving of an edited document by the client back to our server where the document was downloadedstrongp  pI am not Microsoft proficient to know what the best solution would be.p  ol liShould we write a Word AddIn to save to our serverli liHow do we get the Word AddIn into our users desktopsli liCan we embed a Word AddIn into the Word document that is opened on the clientli ol

Negative 10580 pThis question has been asked before.  But, I am still unable to find a solution.p  pI have integrated Paypal Payment into my website.

Negative 10580 pI have two different types of hosts, simple and smart, which are both running the same software. I also have a broadcast socket, listening for discovery, that is only finding simple hosts but is not finding the smart hosts.  I know that both hosts are running software that causes the host to have a socket join the multicast group 239.255.255.250 SSDP, which I am thinking definitely has something to do with this.  p  pIve put code in as a test to purposely join my computer with the multicast group for SSDP, and this made my test host discoverable from different networks, just like the simple hosts are.p  pThrough some research I found that SSDP can overflow into the network. But this doesnt explain why only one type of the hosts is being discovered. p  pAny background knowledge would be appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 10580 pI have successfully migrated application from OC4J to JBoss AS7, however I am facing one issue, We have one jar which is used by 2 ear files and ear file names are different i.e demoabc.ear and demoefg.ear. When i used to deploy these ear files in JBoss 7, JBoss uses ear file name in JNDI binding of deployed bean. So if the ear name is different, JNDI names are different for same bean. So is there any way to define custom jndi binding in JBoss 7 independent of ear file namep  pI want to use fix jndi and can be used independent of ear file namep
Negative 10580 pMy understanding of the generators in Python and ECMAScript is that they are more capable than ordinary generators. For example, both allow for values to passed back into the generator via codenextcode, and they both allow yielding from another generator codeyield fromcode in Python and codeyield code in ES6, two things that arent needed in generators.p  pSo, given this extended functionality, are generators as implemented in Python and ES6 for all intents and purposes the same as coroutines Are there any differencesp

Nodes would be able to verify the changes against their own allowing for new changes, and would be able to verify the random piece of the file against said piece of their version, but is this practicalli ul  pIm thinking the third option is best, but Im not sure if Paxos allows this. The idea would be to limit the data exchanged each round to maybe 1500 bytes, and fill that 1500 bytes with changes to the file primarily. Most rounds, the file would be unchanged, and the rounds in which something changed would most likely be less than 100 bytes of altered state, so the other 1400 bytes could be filled with some piece of the file, which would allow new nodes to build up the entire file over time. Is this practical Has this problem already been solvedp

Negative 10580 pI am attempting to add a new emDeliverablePackageem entity to my database. Each emDeliverablePackageem entity will contain references to one or more new not currently existing emDeliverablePackageItemem entities, so these emDeliverablePackageItemem entities need to be created at the same time as the emDeliverablePackageem entity itself. The request is being made to a WebAPI web service, so the model definition is being sent as JSON. This example is a package with a single package item p  precode   Label PackageName,   SKU PRT04060101,   Description Its a test package,   PackageItems [                  DeliverableID 652,         DeliverableQty 1          ]  codepre  pUsing WebAPI this JSON is hydrated into my Domain models.

Negative 10580 pI am working on an app for a client that runs in the background.p  pIts not an app store app, so it does not have quite the same rules that normally apply to app store apps. Even private APIs are an option for this app, but it must run on a nonjailbroken device. The app will be an enterprise app.p  pThe app needs to know the current device orientation. Seems simple, but its not. Im using the normal code youd expectp  precodeUIDeviceOrientation deviceOrientation  [UIDevice currentDevice].orientation BOOL inLandscape  UIDeviceOrientationIsLandscapedeviceOrientation codepre  pHowever, it seems that this returns the orientation that was in force when the app moved from foreground to background. p  pI need the orientation to track the actual device orientation. Actually what I REALLY want is the user interface orientation of the current foreground app, but Apple makes that really hard to deduce. Ill settle for the device orientation if I have to.p  pThis app is written in ObjectiveC, but I speak Swift as well, so answers expressed in either language are fine.p

Negative 10580 pIm trying to write a simple java application with multiClient Server. My first steps was successfull. I wrote simple apps which operate with multipleClients in console. Something like simple Chat.p  pNow Im working on another, more complex project. I wrote simple GUI program, which has Board with moving rectangles. Each Player is represented by his own rectangle which he can move across the Board. My goal is that if  the other player will join the server, Ill be able to watch him on the board.p  pI also wrote Server program. When Server is running and Player starts the application, he is trying to connect to Game Server. If connection is successfull Server starts new Thread which represents each client Player. Then Player receives uID from Server and then send his Player object to Server ArrayList which stores all connected players.p  pTo this moment everything is fine, because transmission of data between the player and the server is invoked only once, in a specific order get uID from server, then send Player object to Server ArrayList.p  pMy problem starts here.

Negative 10580 pIve an application using an adaptive codeUISplitControllercode. So it behaves as codeUISplitViewControllercode for horizontal regular sizes and as a codeUINavigationControllercode for horizontal compact sizes.p  pThe content of the master is a codeUINavigationControllercode. Its root is a codeUITableViewControllercode. When pressing one of the rows I push in the master a codeDocumentDetailViewControllercode and, depending on the content I present a specific codeUIViewControllercode in the detail codeshowDetailViewController sendercode.p  pMy problem is the following once I press the back button in the codeDocumentDetailViewControllercode, I want to reset the content of the right panel, that is the default controller I show when nothing is selected in the table. But, if i do this by calling codeshowDetailViewController sendercode the result is ok for regular size, but wrong for the compact.
