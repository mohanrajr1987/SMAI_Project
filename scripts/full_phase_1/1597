Positive 1597 pIve been playing with the Twitter Streaming API using the Tweepy library. I started by following my own account and streaming my own tweets as I posted them, which worked fine. p  pI then attempted to stream a fairly large regions tweets [30,85,31,84], to which I initially seemed to receive no data. I then started receiving Location Deletion Notices, or scrubgeo messages, and have only ever received those since. I changed my code back to the previously working follow code, but I continue to receive scrubgeo messages and not statuses from my profile. p  pHeres the script Im usingp  precode Import the necessary methods from tweepy library from tweepy.streaming import StreamListener from tweepy import OAuthHandler from tweepy import Stream   Other libs import json   Variables that contains the user credentials to access Twitter API accesstoken  ltmyaccesstokengt accesstokensecret  ltmysecrettokengt consumerkey  ltmyconsumerkeygt consumersecret  ltmyconsumersecretgt    This is a basic listener that just prints received tweets to stdout. class StdOutListenerStreamListener      def ondataself, data         try             jsondata  json.loadsdata             print jsondata[createdat]     data[text]         except         print Data   strdata         return True      def onerrorself, status         print Error   strstatus         if status  420             print420 error.             return False   if name  main       This handles Twitter authetification and the connection to Twitter Streaming API     l  StdOutListener     auth  OAuthHandlerconsumerkey, consumersecret     auth.setaccesstokenaccesstoken, accesstokensecret     stream  Streamauth, l       Start streaming with right parameters     tallahassee[30,85,31,84]     stream.filterlocationstallahassee           lt previously used      stream.filterfollowltmyuseridgt codepre

Positive 1597 pIve written an android application that needs the user location, it was working fine when I used gps provider, but I dont want to use GPS because it uses a lot of battery, here is my code p  precodeLocationManager locaionManager  LocationManager getSystemServiceContext.LOCATIONSERVICE locationManager.requestLocationUpdatesLocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER,51000,0, new MyLocaionListener Location loco  locationManager.getLastKnownLocationLocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER Log.denabled ,  locationManager.isProviderEnabledLocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER codepre  pThis code returns a codenullcode Location Object, and the logCat shows codeenabledfalsecode when the location service is disabled Balthough Im using NETWORKPROVIDERB But when I enable the location service from the phone settings I get codeenabledtruecode and I get my current location.br So my question is does network provider also uses the phone GPS and how do GPS and NETWORK providers internally works.p

As such, codeLocationResult.hasResultcode returns false.

However in this country I would like to get the gps coordinates using Baidu instead of google or the different services given by android.p  pUsing this tuto works but not accurately enough a hrefhttpwww.androidhive.info201207androidgpslocationmanagertutorial relnofollowhttpwww.androidhive.info201207androidgpslocationmanagertutorialap  pThats why I wish to use Baidu to get my gps coordinate in China. Someone know how to do it  I dont speak chinese so the doc is quite useless in my case  with both chinese and nonchinese android phones Since the android from China have more possibilities with different chinese services.p  pThanks in advance.p

Positive 1597 pI have an app that utilizes CoreLocation. I have it set that some position information is displayed onscreen while the app is running. I installed the app on my iPhone 6 and my iPad 3. When I go outside holding both devices a foot apart, they claim that they are 40 feet apart. How can I fix this My app relies on location information being uniformly correct across multiple devices, so I really need help finding a solution to this. Could it be because one is an iPad Or that the iPad is older than the iPhone Also, they are both running iOS 9.p

However, EMC conveniently forgot to mention that the first 5 disks had to be setup in a RAID 5 for the system volumes. We havent signed the agreement yet, but I obviously need to come up with a new disk layout for this to work out.p  pThey suggest we put the 15k SAS disks in a RAID 5  hot spare, but wont this rather quickly give me write performance issues Besides the RAID 5, wed then be left with a 6 disk RAID 6 leaving us 43TB usable data depending on hot sparenot.p  pAlternatively we should stick with the RAID 10 for our DBs and put our 1TB 7,2k SATA disks in RAID5  Though Im not fond of the rebuild time and insecurity of running these in RAID5. The raid level suits web data much better however.p  pSo we basically have three choices as I see itp  precode6 x 15k SAS RAID5 for System Volumes  DB datalog  hot spare 6 x 7,2k SATA RAID6 for file data  hot spare codepre  pORp  precode6 x 7,2k SATA RAID5 for System Volumes  file data  hot spare 5 x 15k SAS RAID10 for DB datalog  hot spare codepre  pORp  precode5 x 15k SAS RAID5 for System Volumes  DB Data 2 x 15k SAS RAID1 for DB Log 1 x 15k SAS hot spare 4 x 7,2k SATA RAID5 for file data  hot spare codepre  pOption 1 may have write performance issues. Option 2 can become dangerous during rebuilds. Option 3 is good for DB performance but leaves us only 2TB usable file storage, meaning well soon have to expand with an extra shelf  and at that point convert our file data to a RAID6.p

I want to be able to create a configuration file and feed it a Java object and have it spit out the XML specified in the configuration.  Ideally the configuration would consist of a mapping of possibly deep properties on the java side to XPath or something very much like it on the XML side.  p  pJAXB is unsuitable because it wants to the create a one to one mapping from object data to XML nodes.  Ive looked at JIBX and XStream but neither of them seem to be designed to do what Im talking about.  p  pEssentially what I want is Dozer, but designed to create an XML document as its target rather than another Java bean.  From my research so far it looks like Im going to have to write this myself.  Can anyone offer a better alternativep  pEDIT The solution must not be predicated on the ability to modify the source Java files.  Annotation based systems are comepletely useless to my purposes here.  It should be possible to define translators for the individual mappings just as it is in Dozer.p  pIt should be noted that I need to be able to specify that a given input field in java might be output in several different places in the XML output, perhaps being transformed in some cases and not in others.  p  pIve already considered doing some sort of straight Java to XML translation of the objects and then performing my task using XSLT, but the problem with that is that these are deep objects with bidirectional connections.  Any mapping of the objects to XML would have a difficult time figuring out how deep in object hierarchy to go, even if it could keep track of which objects should be discounted because theyd been seen already.  p

Negative 1597 pOn each cell of my table view I want to have a bar that the user can slide out from the right.  On the bar I plan to have icons.  So, to do this I subclassed UITableViewCell.  On the cell I have implemented drawRect and in there I have already drawn a gradient and background color on the cell.  From there, I can create a CALayer, give it a frame amp background color, and add it as a sub layer to the Views subLayers array.  I can do all that and it will display my layer on each UITableViewCell.p  pI have added touch events to the cell so I can detect when the user touches the cell and for testing I have made it so when the user swipes, my CALayer gets wider.  But the issue is, when the UITableView scrolls and reuses a cell whose CALayer has been widened, it doesnt recreate the CALayer.  I have tried p  precode[myLayer setNeedsDisplay] codepre  pand used the drawLayerinContext method of its delegate and it doesnt get called.  I have also tried telling call setNeedsDisplay on the cell in my UITableViewController hoping that that will cause a redraw, but it doesnt work.p  pIm not sure what Im missing.  I am new to CoreGraphics amp CoreAnimation.  I have read through the CoreAnimation Developers Guide, but Im assuming I missing something.  Any help would be great.p

I have 7 check boxes that store into an array services[] as you can see by this example viewp  precodeltphp servicesdata  array           name gt services[],          value gt inhomecare,           echo formcheckboxservicesdata, setcheckboxservices[], inhomecare, FALSE gt codepre  pIm quite certain this is the correct fashion because the forms do validate nicely if something goes wrong. Now I start to have issues when storing the values. I have 7 columns that need to have some sort of value... at this point I dont care but ideally it would be a boolean a binary would work okay too. Here is what I have so far in my controller that everyone claims should work but just does notp  precodec  new Clientservicesdata cgtfirstname  thisgtinputgtpostfirstname, TRUE cgtinhomecare  thisgtinputgtpostservices[inhomecare] codepre  pYou can see the string I put for an example that works perfectly and inserts into a VARCHAR type while the array wont go into the database whatsoever. I feel as if that I am missing something here  namely the value in the array but Im just not sure where to go from here. Any help would be much appreciated because the only method I can get to work sacrifices my checkbox validation p

Negative 1597 pI have an ASP.NET MVC web application which integrates a C managed library of ours that loads unmanaged plugins to do some file processing. These unmanaged plugins inturn rely on a few 3rd party libraries to do their dirty work some of which are causing IIS to crash.p  pWe use the exact same library in a desktop application which is able to process the files just fine. The files also process just fine when running under the Cassini web server that comes with Visual Studio 2008 IIS and Cassini are running off the same folder on my local box.p  pIve done a a hrefhttppicasaweb.google.comlhphotoo2AeAYYbb5XGAXvZeytIlnKEqtZLxBABCKvzJjKcfeatdirectlink relnofollowCrash Analysis with Debug Diagnostic imga which Im not able to extract any useful information from.p  pI used procexp a bit to see if there where any failed file or registry access attempts that might be causing an issue but came up short.

Negative 1597 pI am a Scala novice so forgive me if this is a stupid question, but here goes...p  pImagine I wish to create an extended Map type that includes additional methods.  I can see a few ways to do this.  The first would be with compositionp  precodeclass Path[V]val m Map[V, Int]     Define my methods  codepre  pAnother would be via inheritance, e.g.p  precodeclass Path[V] extends Map[V, Int]   Define my methods  codepre  pFinally, Ive also considered the trait route, e.g.p  precodetrait Path[V] extends Map[V, Int]   Define my methods  codepre  pComposition is a bit awkward because you are constantly having to reference the thing inside.  Inheritance is a fairly natural but there is a wrinkle for me more in a sec.  Traits seems like a really elegant way to do this and using the with construct it is really nice but it also has an issue for me.p  pThe wrinkle Im running into is with methods like .  They return a new map.  So lets say the my method referred to above wishes to add something to the map just an example, I know the map already has this, e.g.p  precodetrait Path[V] extends Map[V,Int]      def addOnev V, i Int Path[V]  this  v gt i  codepre  pThis generates an error because the return type is not Path[V].  Now I know I can use with on a new instance to add the Path[V] trait.  But I dont control the construction of the new map here.  Is there any way to add the Path[V] trait  I thought about creating a new immutable map that was prepopulated and then tagging on a with Path[V], but there is no such constructor I can use to create the prepopulated map.p  pI suspect although I havent confirmed it that I would have a similar issue using inheritance.  I could add a new method to add a new entry to the map, but I would not get back a Path[V] which is what I want.  The compositional approach seems to be the only way to go here.p  pI hope this is clear.  Commentsp

Negative 1597 pHey all. Im writing a simple clientserver application just for the experience, networking is fairly new to me where the client sends the server data and the server outputs it to a textbox. It all works fine, except for one small detail... It seems sometimes a connection is made, but the data isnt being sent or read cant work out which and thus nothing is being outputted in the textbox.

Negative 1597 pIve started porting a .NET SQL Server application to LINQ to Entities. I have among others... one table called Users, and one called Time. Time is reported on a specific user UserId, but it is also recorded which user made the report InsertedByUserId and possibly who has updated the Time since insert UpdatedByUserId. This gives me three references to the table Users.p  pWhen I generate a .EDMX from this I get three references to the table Users User, User1 and User2. Without manual edit I have no way of knowing which one refers to the UserId, InsertedByUserId or UpdatedByUserId field.p  pHow do others solve this Maybe its not necessary to register ALL references, and stick with InsertedByUserId and UpdatedByUserId as intsp  pThe manual edit wouldnt be a problem if the database were never updated, but as we make changes to the database every now and then we occasionally have to regenerate the .EMDX, thus removing all manual changes.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1597 pits possible the approach im using with this might be a little wrong, and if so perhaps someone can advise... but in any case, a pattern ive got into for creating responder widgets involves adding an invisible UIButtonTypeCustom that fills the bounds of a UIView in order to add backwardscompatible button behaviour to any view. for my needs, this works perfectly well. in order to slightly improve the user experience of using this hybrid button, i set showsTouchWhenHighlighted to YES for the button. this works fine, but the glow of the button is clipped by the buttons parent UIView. ive triedp  precodebutton.layer.masksToBounds  NO button.clipsToBounds  NO parentView.layer.masksToBounds  NO parentView.clipsToBounds  NO codepre  pbut none of these allow the glow to escape the bounds of the parentView. its quite a minor cosmetic issue, but i think it would look nicer to get this workingp  phope someone can help thanksp

Negative 1597 pI have an interface that has 16 input field boxes.  They are all declared as public pointers within a class, initialized, etc.  However, as my code has grown more and more with private functions doing database committals, error checking, temporary storage routines, etc it has become very painful if a field has to get removed or a new one added I must delve into all these private functions and explicitly removeadd the field and always with regard to the field ordering.p  pThere emhasem to be a simpler wayp  pstrongThis is my idea and am hoping anyone can shoot it down or build upon itstrongp  pMy thought is to store pointers to all the input fields in a array of pointers and then all these private helper functions walk the array however some of these private functions are static some are nonstatic thus some more pointer magic is required, or should I have two of these arrayofpointer functions one for static functions to use and one for nonstatic functions to usep  pTo further complicate things, the method invoked upon the widgets varies depending on what the private function is doing... Some may call valuefoo some may call location1,location2, incrementing in order of the widgets.  Is there a way to pass the method invoked and the parameters to be passed to this new helper function containing the array of input field pointersp  pstrongFood for thoughtstrong Maybe Im trying to get too fancy by saving myself the burden of scrolling all around my code whenever I need to make a change Maybe this will add too much overhead with all the extra pointer indirection Is it better to sufferp  pThanks, any help is appreciated.

Negative 1597 pI find it weird to use codecontext.Server.MapPathcode every time just to determine physical location of some known directoryfile under appdata folder. I have an understanding that once an application is running, it must not be possible to have its physical location be changed without first shutting it down. If this is true, then I can cache physical path of appdata on applicationstart and use the cache value for its execution lifetimep  pI need experts opinion on this matter. Is my assumption right theres no possibility of changing the physical path of an application without restarting it, rightp  pIf this is true, It will save me tons of time from having to include context as a parameter in every odd methodp  pClarity of the method interface is most important to me, and ltcontextgt just doesnt fit into that.p  pBTW, Im using shared hosting so I have no control on application physical placement.

Negative 1597 pI have an entity model build using EF4.1 code first, which uses a WCF Data service to expose the entities. To improve performance I have pregenerated the EF views. This works fine when I run locally, or if I publish the service using visual studio. However, when I use the TFS team build to create the service, I get the following error when try and access my entities via the data servicep  pstrongThe mapping and metadata information for EntityContainer X no longer matches the information used to create the pregenerated views.strongp  pThe TFS team build uses a separate build server to build the data service  entity model. The code being built is identical, the web.config  databases are also identical. This suggests that either the team build or the build server is altering either the view, the edmx file or the DbContext in some way.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp  pRyanp

Negative 1597 pI am writing a php script to determine the fuel usage of trucks. I use  mysql db table for this. p  pThere are several locations that a truck can get fuel, say A, B, C, D locations.

Maybe, by sorting  odometer values ascending and then doing successive calculation between rows seems logical but I could not find out how I can do this. p  pEdit My query is something like thisp  precode    SELECT      t1.odometer AS km1,      t2.odometer AS km2,      FROM fueldispensed AS t2, fueldispensed AS t1     WHERE t1.sequenceid1 t2.sequenceid AND t1.truckidtruckid AND t2.truckidtruckid  ORDER BY t1.sequenceid codepre  padding ORDER BY to this query has no effect since I get the succession on sequenceid.p

The only examples I find are those where the argument is always the same, so they just write  RegisterForEventValidationnameOfControl, XXXX, where XXXX is a fixed string.p  pAny ideas regarding how to write this, or if this isnt the problemp  pThanks.p

Negative 1597 pEDIT I got some progress, so I have simplified and narrowed the problem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10209849howtocallscrollviewdidscrollthesamewayuiscrollviewdoesbutduringcustI have created new question, which is more clearer and more understandable I hopeap  hr  pI have very large horizontally scrolling UIScrollView, which is reusing its subviews. When user scrolls left, the rightmost view is moved to the leftmost position and its content is updated. Similarly when user scrolls right, the leftmost view is moved to the rightmost position and its content is updated. Similarly like in UITableView. This works nicely using scrollviewDidScroll delegate method.p  pNow I need to change offset programatically, but with custom animation behaviour inertia and bounce back to the final position.p  pTo prototype this, I use p  precode[UIView animateWithDurationcontentOffsetCADuration                        delay0                      optionsUIViewAnimationOptionCurveLinear                  animations                       [self setContentOffsetNoDelegateCallscontentOffset animatedNO]                                    completionBOOL finish                       dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,                            [timer invalidate]                                         ] codepre  pwhere I animate content offset with disabled delegate callback, so that views are not messed during animation. But I need something to simultaneously reuse and reposition them.p  pMy solution is to create timer and call codescrollViewDidScrollcode manually so that reusing works as usual, parallel to animation. But it simply does not work  nothing is reused and scrollviews content after animation is in the same state as before animation  formerly visible pages are moved out of screen. p  pstrongSo the question narrows down how to move subviews and update their content during animationstrong p  pOr maybe there might be completely different way doing this ...p

Negative 1597 pWere developing an asp.net mvc 3 application that polls a server on a javascript timer for data. When the data is returned we display it using jquery 1.7.1 and knockout 2.0. The view is a widget displaying some number of notification divs with text and an icon. p  pWhen we speed up our timer interval to 5 seconds and return a large amount of notifications a problem occurs. After a random amount of time we get the chrome Aw Snap page appearing. Anywhere between 3 minutes to 30 minutes of letting the timer tick. Note that our application needs to opened in the browser 247 which is why we went through the long term testing.p  pAfter research, it seems theres no way to diagnose an Aw Snap page other than looking at google chromes logging. We tried using Sawbuck with verbose logging on which didnt show anything out of the ordinary when the Aw Snap page appears.p  pWe are at the point of removing elements from the dom, commenting out code, removing css style, trying everything we can think of to get to the bottom of this. All of which has failed.p  pDoes anyone know what a good next step to take is What causes chrome Aw Snap pages Could it be a javascript call or is it likely due to dom manipulation Any help would be greatly appreciated. p  pUpdatep  pWhen we load up the dump file mentioned in the comments in windbg we get this call stack of where the exception occurred.

Negative 1597 pI recently found an issue whereby I wanted to use the spMSforeachtable stored proc to select all tables with the word Transcode in the table name, and to run some SQL on those tables.  I managed to write some code which worked, but not perfectly  for those tables which Id hoped it would gracefully skip over i.e. those which did not have transcode in the name it instead threw errors due to certain expected columns which only exist in the transcode tables not existing on those tables.  The issue seems to be that all SQL is parsed when the stored proc is called, rather than parsing the SQL only when required e.g. when a condition is met.p  pThe following code works as expectedp  precodeexec spMSforeachtable  print Table being tested  if exists select 1 where  like Transcode begin     print     Do Something end else begin     print     Ignored end  codepre  pHowever, when I then try to add functionality, I get errors from code which would never be run e.g.p  precodeexec spMSforeachtable  print Table being tested  if exists select 1 where  like Transcode begin     print     Do Something      insert  col1, col2, col3     select col1, col2, 1     from      where col3  0  end else begin     print     Ignored end  codepre  pThis time I get the same output as the first one for those where the tablename contains the word Transcode, but for those where it doesnt instead of seeing Ignored, I see p  blockquote   pMsg 207, Level 16, State 1, Line 9p      pInvalid column name col3p blockquote  pIm pretty sure this is down to the way the dynamic SQL is parsed, but its undesirable behaviour.  Has anyone come across this before  is there a simple workaroundp  pThis is not urgent as in my case thanks to the columns not existing the errors had the same effect as the if statement anyway, and the valid lines were able to run successfully, but Im keen to learn in case I need to do something similar soon where this behaviour would cause issues.p  pThanks in advance,p  pJBp  pps. code to replicate this behaviours included belowp  precodecreate table DemoTranscode1 id bigint identity1,1 primary key clustered, col1 nvarchar10 not null, col2 nvarchar10not null, col3 bit not null go create table DemoTable1 id bigint identity1,1 primary key clustered, col1 nvarchar10 not null, col2 nvarchar10not null go create table DemoTranscode2 id bigint identity1,1 primary key clustered, col1 nvarchar10 not null, col2 nvarchar10not null, col3 bit not null go create table DemoTranscode3 id bigint identity1,1 primary key clustered, col1 nvarchar10 not null, col2 nvarchar10not null, col3 bit not null go insert DemoTranscode1 select example1, demo, 0 union select example2, demo, 0 union select example3, demo, 0 union select example4, demo, 0 insert DemoTable1 select col1, col2 from DemoTranscode1 insert DemoTranscode2 select col1, col2, col3 from DemoTranscode1 insert DemoTranscode3 select col1, col2, col3 from DemoTranscode1 codepre

Negative 1597 pI am currently looking at jQuery mobile and its system of loading web pages with XmlHttpRequest. Thanks to that it is possible to automatically perform transition animations between two pages, for instance.p  pHowever, something is not clear to me. If I understand correctly, each new page of a jQuery mobile powered website is injected in the DOM of the initial web page. The documentation of jQuery mobile even tells that because of this mechanism, the codelttitlegtcode tag of new webpages are not taken into account.p  pSo, in a way, if my initial webpage A.html loads a page B.html, I would tend to think that the webpage B.html does not need to have a full HTML grammar with the codelthtmlgtcode, codeltheadgtcode or codeltbodygtcode tags.  p  pMy page B.html could directly begin with a codeltdivgtcode element.p  pAm I rightbrIs a full html page needed when loading a HTML page with jQuery mobilebrWhat are the pros and cons about having a webpage with a wrongtruncated HTML syntax appart that this page should not be accessed directly but through the main pagep

Negative 1597 pMy codeDataTablecode has 3 columns A, B and C. None are guaranteed to have unique entries, in nontrivial cases every column will have nonunique entries.p  pThe combination of A, B emisem guaranteed to be unique. Because ADO.NET codeDataTablecode allows using multiple columns as the primary key, I use A and B as my primary key.p  pA vs B represents a matrix with 0 as the default value, so its possible for me to guarantee that entries of B will come from a finite pool and for each entry of A, every possible A, B will appear ie such that there will be exactly codenumber of unique A values  number of unique B valuescode rows in the table.p  pMy question has two partsp  p1 How to normalize this so that I have one key and no update anomalies Im not sure but I think I want a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiThirdnormalform relnofollow3NFa Unless I am mistaken, simply adding an extra ID column with nonredundant integers will allow update anomaliesp  p2 How to set it up in C using the ADO.NET library so that whenever I want to add a row, I specify entries of B and C, and then it automatically generates a suitable value of A, so that I can insert C at A, B A can be an integer or a string.p  pThe two are related, since your answer for 2 may affect 1 and vice versa.p
Negative 1597 pIm writing a template for expressions parametrised by an arbitrary number of codecharcode labels.p  pGiven an argument list, a factory function returns an expression of different types depending on whether there are two arguments of the same types or whether they are unique.p  pA concrete example suppose that codeAcode is a labelable object with its codeoperatorcode overloaded to produce an codeExpressionlt...gtcode. Let codea, b, ...code be declared as labels codeLabelNameltagt, LabelNameltbgt, ...code. Then codeAa,b,c,dcode would produce a codeUniqueExpressionlta,b,c,dgtcode, whereas codeAa,c,b,ccode would produce a codeRepeatedExpressionlta,c,b,cgtcode instead.p  pTo achieve this, I had to define the codeExpressioncodes factory function with codeautocode and codedecltypecode. Moreover, the codedecltypecode has to cascade to another codedecltypecode until the metaprogram finishes recursing through the arguments and the return type is finally decided. As an illustration, I have isolated a fairly minimal code for the factory method.p  precodetemplate lttypename... Tgt struct TypeList   template ltchar Cgt struct LabelName    template lttypename...

Now, I understand that the compiler would take more time to perform recursive template deduction as I crank up the number of labels I use.p  pOn my computer, if codebuildexpressioncode is called with one argument, then GCC 4.7.1 takes around 0.26 second to compile on average. The compile time scales up to around 0.29 second for five arguments, and to 0.62 second for ten arguments. This is all perfectly reasonable.p  pThe story is quite different with the Intel compiler. ICPC 13.0.1 compiles the oneargument code in 0.35 second, and the compile time stays pretty much constant for up to four arguments. At five arguments the compile time goes up to 12 seconds, and at six arguments it shoots up above 9600 seconds that is, over 2 hours and 40 minutes. Needless to say, I havent waited long enough to find out how long it takes to compile the sevenargument version.p  hr  pTwo questions immediately come to mindp  ul lipIs the Intel compiler particularly known to be slow to compile recursive codedecltypecodepli lipIs there any way to rewrite this code to achieve the same effect in a way that is perhaps friendlier to the compilerpli ul
Negative 1597 pWe are building an app that is supposed to do several things based on an input text file.

I should have each value of the databody correspond to each unique field, as long as rows match each other, i.e. codeicode and codejcode.

Negative 1597 pAfter searching online with multiple different keywords, I havent been able to find the solution to my problem.p  pI started by looking for a way to popup a message asking for a user to renew their session a minute before it cancels. The solution I decided to use was the run a javascript timer in the masterpage and have it be called on a Masterpage.PageLoad. In this way, whenever my user navigates from page to page, they reset the timer. However, because many of the pages the user will be using have updatepanels and update asynchronously, the function I am using is being reached, but being skipped over according to the debugger.p  pThe function I am using isp  precodeScriptManager.RegisterStartupScriptmain, this.GetType, callTimer, callTimer, true codepre  pThis function runs fine on a regular postbacks, or asynchronous postbacks on the masterpage I update the timer by doing a postback on a updatepanel in the masterpage, however, will be skipped on asynchronous postbacks.p  pI have tried a few things, making the control of the function Page or the UpdatePanel in the masterpage or the updatepanel in the childpages. I have tried putting this code in the childpages as well, but while these change do reset the timer, it causes the javascriptcode to run multiple times and they fight over the label displaying the countdown.p  pIm really at a loss here. I think a possible solution would be to change the startupscripts control and terminate all javascripts running before that code again. However searching for a way to terminate, cancel or stop javascript functions programatically yields no useful results as well.p  pAnother solution I would be okay with is reseting the timer on mouse movement, but since Im designing for IE8, this will not work unless the window is out of focus.p

Negative 1597 pI have a rails website that is about to be sold to different clients with small variations for each client. In the mean while Ill be definitely developing fix andor modifying the common parts of the project. So how would be the preferred way to manage this developing process with Git Initially I though that Branching would be the way to go... but 1 min later I realized that anything committed on a single branch wouldnt available on other branches and this way to fix something in the common code would result in multiple commit to each branch. In the end I though that Tags might solve the problem since its a way to track variations on a single branch.  I couldnt think of any other options. Maybe someone can help.p

Negative 1597 pAs part of the ASP.NET website I maintain localizationtext translations are handled using text stored in a SQL database and not using ResX files why it is done this way is down to legacy but that is what we do but it does allow us to make changes fairly easily. Text is stored in a table like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE [Text]     [TextID] [int] NOT NULL,     [LanguageID] [int] NOT NULL,     [Text] [nvarchar]max NULL  CONSTRAINT [PKText] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED       [TextID] ASC,     [LanguageID] ASC  codepre  pAnd the codebehind in the website will reference the text IDs for a chosen language to assign the correct text to the HTML elements such as labels etc.p  pNow because we have so much text available and hitting the database on each page request just to translate a page is so slow what we actually do is cache all the text in that table into server memory at application startup using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comengblibraryms17859428vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowHttpApplicationStatea.p  pThe problem we now have is that, because we have several web servers being load balanced, updating that static cache is becoming difficult we now have to wait for the app pool to recycle before any changes made become visible. Also as the link above suggestsp  blockquote   p...storing large blocks of data in application state can fill up server memory, causing the server to page memory to disk.p blockquote  pSo what I would like to know is what other solution could I use I need to be able to cache all this text for higher performance but also be able to update it more regularly than once a day, plus be able to manage this cache across multiple servers.p

Negative 1597 pI have read a ton of articles on writing to the internal storage of an android device, and I need some help figuring out what I am doing wrong.  In the main activity of my app, I read a value from a file stored in the internal storage like thisp  precodestring ID  GetID codepre  pWhere GetID looks like thisp  precodestring GetID              try                       using var i  new StreamReader OpenFileInput FILENAME                               return i.ReadToEnd                                  catch                       return                codepre  pIf the file doesnt exist,  is returned and the user is sent off to another activity to register. In that activity, I use this to call a function to write to internal storage like thisp  precodeWriteID uniqueID codepre  pWhere WriteID looks like thisp  precodevoid WriteIDstring uniqueID              using var o  new StreamWriter              OpenFileOutput FILENAME, FileCreationMode.Private             o.Write uniqueID      codepre  pThis is where it gets weird for me, if I put these two functions in the same activity, write to the file and then call the function to read from it, I get uniqueID returned correctly. However if I stop the app and then restart it, I get a File Not Found exception thrown and nothing returned from the read function. However, if I create a new project, and use the same code, everything works as expected file is created and written to, then on restart the data persists. p  pSo I am thinking there is some setting that I have changed or some reference that I may be missing in my original app that causes the internal storage file to be removed  when the app is stoppedp  pAny ideas as to why this works correctly in my test app, but not in the otherp

Observes PersonModel.      PersonController         Instantiates PersonView. Observes PersonView. Instantiates PersonModel. Updates PersonModel.  PersonList      PersonListModel         Stores a list of Persons      PersonListView         Displays a list of persons with appropriate Add  Delete buttons. Observes PersonList.      PersonListController         Instantiates PersonListView. Observes PersonListView. Instantiates PersonListModel. Updates PersonListModel codepre  pAlso, a bootstrap, where the app starts. It creates a new AppController.p  pIn the real application, there will be more and different ModelViewController objects but I want to keep this example simple.p  pI dont understand how I can go about merging these seperate views into one UI while maintaining a good seperation of concerns.p  pTake for example the PersonListView. IMHO it doesnt need to care about the AppView with the JFrame etc. PersonListView just needs to look at its emownem model and update emitselfem accordingly. However, I cannot enforce that because the PersonListViews own Swing components need to be added to the Swing components of another view, the AppView.p  pSo at the moment the AppController is instantiating its own View, plus indirectly a PersonView and PersonListView via instantiation of their controllers. AppController then grabs the main Jpanel for each view, grabs the parent Swing components they should be added to on the AppView, and adds them.p  pThis just doesnt seem the right way to do it to me. Im pulling Swingrelated members from their hiding places and messing with them around inside a controller. In fact instantiating the model and view within the controller seems bad too, but I cant figure out a better way.p  pIve seen enough simple MVC tutorials recently that Im dreaming of the bloody things  but not one tutorial seems to go into the relationships of multiple models, views, controllers, especially where it concerns Swing. Maybe I am wrong and the App should have just one view Maybe I need a Relationship class that sort of takes every single ModelViewController and instantiates stuff appropriatelyp  pAny advice would be most appreciated as Im completely at a lossp

Negative 1597 pFirst off before you grill me to the floor, i would like to say i have spent considerable amount of time reading and researching this topic. I have read some on stackoverflow itself such as p  ol lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3430181aclimplementationACL implementationali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5875646databaseschemaforaclDatabase schema for ACLali ol  pwhat i found interesting was that it necessarily explains to me how to create a good acl implementation and i followed methods from both of these. Also i referred to Database Concepts by Korth to understand query optimization and performance impacts.p  pBut my real question comes down to this dumb approach. Why isnt it just better to create Roles on the Database and grant permissions to tables and then access the database using a respective role. Since i am using SQL SERVER, all i have to do is specifiy the username and password on the connection string and get it over with. I just want to know the pros and cons of such an approach rather than spending loads of time writing and testing your own ACL implementation agreed the learning is fun D. So please advice.p

VI Setting up your DNS to work with Heroku Hostname SSLp  ol lipYou should recieve an email from heroku within a few minutes of adding the       sslhostname addon. You need to add a CNAME record to your DNS that points to the AWS host      in the email you receive. This should be pretty self explanatory, but if you have any questions, search for adding a CNAME record in Google and youll see lots of good guides.pli lipTest that host secure.yourdomain.com outputs something.amazonaws.com. If it does, youre all set. You should now be able to go to a hrefhttpssecure.yourdomain.com relnofollowhttpssecure.yourdomain.coma and not see any errors or security warnings. What is going on behind the scenes When a user visits your site using a hrefhttpsecure.yourdomain.com relnofollowhttpsecure.yourdomain.coma, theyre hitting your GoDaddy CNAME record, which points to an something.amazonaws.com address which effectively routes the request to Herokus grid, and a secure connection gets established from there following the standard SSL handshake process.pli ol  pI didnt get an email, neither does appname.herokussl.com exist Am I suppose to use Zerigo DNS for anything, its mentioned once in the top of the tutorial but not anywhere elsep  pFrom reading the comments, someone got a problem with the end part as well.p  pThanksp

Negative 1597 pHey everyone I am working on a custom app store for iOS. However, I am having a problem when my system tries to stream large ipa files to the device. Sense there is no way to tell the device the total size of the file during the stream the status bar on the iOS device wont budge until the file is finished downloading then it almost completely fills the status bar in an instant and installs the file. This may leave users to think that the download isnt working at all. I am trying to find an alternative way to handle these large ipa files. I am currently thinking that I could allow the device to make a direct request to the file without hitting any .Net runtime code. I would probably be able to handle this through an ISAPI filter, but then I would need a way to authenticate that request to make sure the user has access to that download. Any advice or input would be appreciated.  Thanks.p
Negative 1597 pI have been creating a simple tile based game to help me learn python and wx python. For starters I wanted to create my own world and to test the simple map generator I made, I bound the return key to generate a new map and display it. That is when I ran into this problem. It slows down a lot every time you click return, renders each tile line by line which is obviously slow and inefficient and eventually just freezes.p  pI am quite a novice programmer and have never dealt with any form of GUI so this is all very new to me, please bear with me I can guess that the way I have things set up is very taxing for the machine, and that perhaps Im causing a lot of recursion.

Negative 1597 pI wrote a code for a damage calculator in Pokemon, that would return a calculated value based on a damage formula if given the required data in the html form. Im absolutely sure that the html form is correct, but the calculator itself will return 0.0 as an output, despite having cgi.FieldStorage enabled.p  pEssentially, Im trying to return a calculated value, but I think that my lack of knowledge about indenting has led to my function returning 0.0 The code is posted on pastebin a hrefhttppastebin.comZfphx9DD relnofollowCalculator Codeap  pThe problem arises in my getdamage function the more than 1000line long function. The variables in the beginning are empty strings or 0, and if the html form is submitted, and everything is filled in, the variables will have data added to it. I also try to run a calculation within the function in itself lines 129131p  precode    if t in moveList     basedamageindex  intmoveList.indext 3     basedamageintmoveList[basedamageindex] codepre  pThese three lines were written in order to obtain the base damage which is a numerical value in the moveList variable that contains the split .csv file.p  precode    damage 2  level  10250attackdefensebasedamage2 codepre  pThis line of code is on line 133 of the pastebin. This is the calculated damage based on all of the data obtained in the form. The following lines 1341523 are written to check the effectiveness of a move. For example electric is supereffective against water, so damage would be multiplied by 2. These are all ifstatements that use previous functions checkmovetypex, typeax, and typebx and check for the types of the pokemon that was filled out in the html form. It then multiplies the line 133 accordingly. The code finally returns damage with return damage, and the final three lines in the code p  precodeprint lthtmlgtltbodygtThe damage output should be about  print getdamage print ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre  pserve to print out the damage.p  pIn conclusion, the calculator will only return 0, but should return a calculated value, when I submit the html form, despite all of the areas being filled in. I feel like this may be a problem with my indenting. Can somebody please check to see if my indenting is incorrectp  pThanks very much.p

Negative 1597 pI am currently working on a Rails app and I will need to include an interactive banner on the homepage. As of right now, I only have a few static pages which function as the landing pages for the full site.p  pFor this particular banner, we will need to present a few options available to new users who wish to sign up with our service. Along the bottom of the banner will be a tab bar in which the various options are shown. The user can click on an of the tabs and the banner image will change and give a brief Call To Action in a box that overlays the image. Within this call to action, there will be a link which will lead to a page with more information about that particular option that they viewed.p  pA very good example of this is a hrefhttpslocalstake.com relnofollowhttpslocalstake.coma. For all intents and purposes I am trying to replicate the banner from that site, with appropriate changes to match the content of our particular service.p  pAm I correct in assuming that this will be accomplished via JavaScript My experience with JavaScript is very limited. I only did something very briefly with it many, many years ago in high school for a class project.p  pIf anyone can provide a link to a tutorial or help me directly with this, it will be much appreciated. I would assume that it functions very similarly to an image rotator, albeit without the automatic transitions and only requiring a manual click to change the banner.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 1597 pI cant get AlarmManager to work when screen is locked. The app works just fine on my Sony Ericsson Xperia Active with Android 2.3.4, regardless of if the screen is locked or not. I always see the debug message onReceive in LogCat. But when I try to run the app on newer devices with newer versions of Android, e.g Samsung Galaxy Xcover2 with android 4.1.2, the app only works as long as the screen is on.

Negative 1597 pI am encountering some very obscure issues with a super basic app I have created.p  pApplication rundownp  ol liMain Activity  Shows a login screen where the app submits the username and password to an api. Once this is complete, an intent is sent to start the next activityli liDownload Activity  This activity downloads a bunch of files from a server and puts them in the Downloads folder for use later on. Once all downloads are complete, another intent is sent to start the third and final activity. This activity displays a progress bar for the file downloads.li liWeb View Activity  This activity starts and launches a Runnable. This runnable is designed to call a function, then 5 minutes later, rerun itself, ad infinitum. the function it runs creates a WebView in a layout the layout has a container layout that is used so we can dynamically create the webview every time. A basic HTML page in the Downloads folder is loaded into the Web View.li ol  pSo, I launched the app and it started working no problems. The HTML file was loaded, and I left the office.p  pI came back to the app this morning, and the Web View was not visible, and the login screen the view for the first activity, was on the screen.p  pI quit the app and checked the app Im using to record the logcat. It showed the Runnable firing every 12 minutes, instead of 5 300,000 milliseconds. Weird.p  pSo I trawled through about 12 hours of logcat, with the runnable launching every couple of minutes again, it should be 5. No sign of app failure.p  pIs there a chance the Web View could be running, but underneath the layout for the first activity If so, what would cause thatp  pBelow is my code for the Web View Activityp  precodepublic class WebViewActivity extends Activity   Timer autoUpdate Handler handler  new Handler Handler webHandler  new Handler  Intent intent ArrayListltStringgt advertArray ProgressDialog pd File playlistFile File path File adFile  private int currentIndex  0  private LinearLayout webContainer private WebView webView  public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      Log.iMYAPP, Starting WebViewActivity      getWindow.addFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGKEEPSCREENON      setContentViewR.layout.activitywebview      webContainer  LinearLayout findViewByIdR.id.webviewContainer      handler.postDelayedrunnable, 0   private Runnable runnable  new Runnable      Override     public void run          Log.irunnable, loadHTML         loadHtml         handler.postDelayedthis, 600000        private void loadHtml      intent  getIntent     advertArray  ArrayListltStringgtintent.getSerializableExtraadverts      Log.iadvert array size, advertArray.size      Log.dmain, ACTIVITY ONCREATE      webView  new WebViewthis     webView.setLayoutParamsnew LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT      webContainer.removeAllViews      webContainer.addViewwebView      webView.setWebChromeClientnew WebChromeClient     webView.setWebViewClientnew WebViewClient     webView.getSettings.setAppCacheEnabledfalse     webView.getSettings.setJavaScriptEnabledtrue     webView.getSettings.setRenderPriorityRenderPriority.HIGH      path  Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectoryEnvironment.DIRECTORYDOWNLOADS  files      String index  advertArray.getcurrentIndex     Log.iadvert array index, index     adFile  new Filepath    index  index.html      webView.loadUrlfile  adFile.getAbsolutePath    codepre
Negative 1597 pI need to be able to repeatably, nonrandomly, uniquely identify a server host, which may be arbitrarily virtualized and over which I have no control.p  ul liA MAC address doesnt work because in some virtualized environments, network interfaces dont have hardware addresses.li liGenerating a state file and saving it to disk doesnt work because the virtual machine may be cloned, thus duplicating the file.li liThe servers SSH host keys may be a candidate. They can be cloned like a state file, but in practice they generally arent because its such a security problem that its a mistake not often made.li liTheres also varlibdbusmachineid, but thats dependent on dbus.

Thanks Alfie Johnli ul  pId like the solution to persist a long time, and certainly across server reboots and software restarts. Ultimately, I also know that users of my software will deprecate a host and want to replace it with another, but keep continuity of the data associated with it, so there are reasons a UUID might be considered mutable over the long term, but I dont particularly want a host to start considering itself to be unknown and reregister itself for no reason.p  pAre there any alternative persistent, unique identifiers for a hostp

Negative 1597 pI am trying to get my FTP site to use an SQL database table for authentication.  I found this a hrefhttptechblog.edwardting.com20100721creatingacustomdatabasedrivenauthenticationforaniis7ftpsiteusingvisualstudioc relnofollowguidea.  And followed it almost to the letter, except I am using IIS 8 and Visual Studio 2010.  Now because the GAC is no longer put in CWindowsassembly I found my .dll in the new location CWindowsMicrosoft.NETassemblyGACMSIL.  After a lot of research I managed to find the properties for this the Culture, Version, and Public Key Token that are required.  I added this as a custom provider.  Now it seems like everything is in place like it should be but when I log onto the ftp site it fails to log in withp  precodeResponse   530 User cannot log in. Error  Critical error Error  Could not connect to server codepre  pI have been doing some trouble shooting and it doesnt look like the .dll is even being referenced.  I set it to always return true so that it would grant anyone with any password access, and received the same error.  I have been looking all over the place but all I can find is stuff about IIS 7 and things where the GAC is located in the old location. The FTP site was working fine, I was able to connect to it, with the basic authentication that is build in to IIS so I am pretty sure the site isnt the problem. p  pSo my question is where do I go from here  Is IIS 8 not looking in the new GAC location for my .dll  Is this why it seems like the code isnt being run at all  Or am I missing something that is obvious that will make me feel like an idiot when it gets answeredp  pI am stuck so even pointing me in a new direction would be helpful at this point.p

Negative 1597 pIve read quite a few questions here that discuss the cost of using ArrayLists vs LinkedLists in Java.  One of the most useful Ive seen thus far is is here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions322715whentouselinkedlistoverarraylistWhen to use LinkedListltgt over ArrayListltgta.p  pI want to be sure that Im correctly understanding.p  pIn my current use case, I have multiple situations where I have objects stored in a List structure.  The number of objects in the list changes for each run, and random access to objects in the list is never required.  Based on this information, I have elected to use LinkedLists with ListIterators to traverse the entire content of the list.p  pFor example, my code may look something like this brp  precodefor Object thisObject  theLinkedList       do something  codepre  pIf this is a bad choice, please help me understand why.p  pMy current understanding is that traversing the entire list of objects in a LinkedList would incur On cost using the iterative solution.  Since there is no random access to the list i.e. The need to get item 3, for example, my current understanding is that this would be basically the same as looping over the content of an ArrayList and requesting each element with an index.p  pAssuming I knew the number of objects to be stored in the list beforehand, my current line of thinking is that it would be better to initialize an ArrayList to the appropriate size and switch to that structure entirely without using a ListIterator.  Is this logic soundp  pAs always, I greatly appreciate everones inputp

The codeSurveyUpdateViewcode also inherits from codeUpdateViewWithTechcode, which basically just limits the queryset by user and automatically sets a field representing the user.p  pThe problem Im having is in rendering the initial data. In the codegetcode method of codeSurveyUpdateViewcode, Im fetching all of the areas currently associated with that survey, and using PDB Ive been able to confirm that at the point where I fetch the areas relating to this survey in the variable areas, the data appears to be correct. Heres how it looks with 8 itemsp  precode[description uA, photo u, actionrequired uA, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 21L, actiontaken True, name uA, description uA, photo u, actionrequired uA, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 19L, actiontaken True, name uA, description uA, photo u, actionrequired uA, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 29L, actiontaken True, name uA, description uA, photo u, actionrequired uA, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 30L, actiontaken True, name uA, description uB, photo u, actionrequired uB, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 22L, actiontaken True, name uB, description uB, photo u, actionrequired uB, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 20L, actiontaken True, name uB, description uB, photo u, actionrequired uB, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 31L, actiontaken True, name uB, description uC, photo u, actionrequired uC, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 23L, actiontaken True, name uC, description uX, photo u, actionrequired uX, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 24L, actiontaken True, name uX, description uY, photo u, actionrequired uY, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 25L, actiontaken True, name uY, description uZ, photo u, actionrequired uZ, actionby datetime.date2013, 11, 14, surveyid 12L, uid 26L, actiontaken True, name uZ] codepre  pHowever, passing that data through as the value of codeinitialcode when instantiating codeAreaFormSetcode doesnt render the data correctly. If in the definition of codeAreaFormSetcode, I set the value of codeextracode, I get that number of areas rendered if undefined, it shows three, which I believe is the default value of codeextracode. The behaviour I want to see is for each existing area to be rendered in its own form.p  pAgain using PDB, if I dump the value of areaform after its set with codeareaform.astablecode, I only get the number of forms set in codeextracode, so the issue does appear to be with passing through the initial data.p  pAm I passing through the value of codeinitialcode correctly I understood that the value of codeinitialcode should be a list of dictionaries, and it looks correct to me, but Im not getting the correct number of areas rendering. p

But Im noticing a significant delay between the touch event and the sound being played, even after the audio file has been cached.

Negative 1597 pI now have sufficent exposure to the ObjectiveC that if im stuck with anything, I know how to think of the problem in terms of a likely tool I need and go look for it. Simple really. Theres A Method For That. So nothings a real problem anymore.p  pNow Im looking deeper at the language in broader terms. We write stuff. The compiler hews out all the code to execute it. From a simple flashlight app thats a ifthen decision to turn on, to a highly complex accelerometer driven 3D shoot em up with blood n guts and body parts following all sorts of physics, the compiler prepares the code ready to be executed like a giant railway layout. No matter how random it appears on the screen, everything possible can be generically described and prepared for.p  pSo heres the questionbr Are there cases where something completely unexpected to the software designer can still be handled without an execution halt  Maybe Id better reframe the question a few different ways Can a  objectiveC  program metacompile within itself in response to an unplannedfor user request  or to reput my opening remark, are there tools or methods for unlikely descriptions of unlikely problemsp

Negative 1597 pI am trying to invert a dense matrix of size 50,000  rows. I have been slowly trying to work to getting the SciPy GMRES operation to work. It seems to be taking an inordinate amount of time for one iteration. I am entering the following informationp  precodexgm  scipy.sparse.linalg.gmresA,b,tol1e08,maxiter1 codepre  pwhere A is a class object which calls a function to compute the matrix vector product Av. This uses the Python Multiprocessing Pool command to compute the matrix vector product quickly. For the matrix I am interested in, I have timed this product AV with a multiprocessing pool of 8 cores and it takesabout 50 seconds. However, running the above gmres command for one iteration takes 1370 seconds.I was under the impression that the bulk of the computation time would be the matrix vector product. This seems to be a bit odd and Im wondering if there is something else going on here. Is the gmres ignoring the 1 iteration command and doing multiple iterations Any advice or information would be appreciated. p  pThe version of Scipy I am using is version .0.9.0.p

Negative 1597 pI noticed that Windows Azure Diagnostics uses a UTC ticks primary key as a method of making it easy to access entries by time ranges. I would like to implement a similar system for my table.p  pHowever a major issue is that the systems that will be doing the uploading will not necessarily have their time synced to the millisecond not to mention ping time differences so setting the Partition key locally and then uploading doesnt work well I am having all kinds of race condition issues. Ideally I would like to guarantee that any time a table entry is made its partition key is certain to be greater than or equal to any partition key already in the table since thats how time works.p  pThe only way that I can think to ensure this guarantee is by having the timestamp partition key set server side. Is there some way to have this happen, such as via a server side scriptp  pNote I realize that a timestamp is added already for when an entry is made, but tables are not indexed by this timestamp.p

I try to wrap my head around this outcome.p  pWhy does the pool need to share a lock and queue between all processes but the individual processes from condition 3 dont p  pWhat I know is that for the pool conditions 1 and 2 all data from the iterators is passed via pickling, whereas in single process conditions 3 and 4 all data from the iterators is passed by inheritance from the main process I am using strongLinuxstrong.  I guess until the memory is changed from within a child process, the same memory that the parental process uses is accessed copyonwrite. But as soon as one says codelock.acquirecode, this should be changed and the child processes do use different locks placed somewhere else in memory, dont they How does one child process know that a brother has activated a lock that is not shared via a managerp  pFinally, somewhat related is my question how much different conditions 3 and 4 are. Both having individual processes but they differ in the usage of a manager. Are both considered to be emvalidem code Or should one avoid using a manager if there is actually no need for onep  hr  h2Full Scripth2  pFor those who simply want to copy and paste everything to execute the code, here is the full scriptp  precodeauthor  Me and myself  import multiprocessing as mp import time  def thejobargs     The job for multiprocessing.

I am currently accessing YouTube videos for the demonstrations.  I filmed people at my gym doing the movements today and I am curious what would be the best way to package these videos within my application.  Im assuming I can include them in my drawables and access them from there.  Also, what type of files should I make them  The videos will each be less than 30 seconds so I dont think they will take up too much space in the application, but I could be wrong.  Anyway, any advice would be welcome.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1597 pMy app is very imageheavy, so I need to supply a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comgoogleplayexpansionfiles.html relnofollowexpansion filesa with my APK. Ive chosen to store all my images in a ZIP file and use the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comgoogleplayexpansionfiles.htmlZipLib relnofollowzip librarya to get access to my images. p  pMy first intuition was to unzip all files when the app is first started and store them in the apps external directory. The guide gently nudges me to take a different approachp  blockquote   h1Reading media files from a ZIPh1      pIf youre using your expansion files to store media files, a ZIP file   still allows you to use Android media playback calls that provide   offset and length controls such as MediaPlayer.setDataSource and   SoundPool.load. In order for this to work, you must not perform   additional compression on the media files when creating the ZIP   packages.p blockquote  pSo I guess Ill just get an input stream from the zip file when I have to, but I dont really know how long I should have that zip file open. p  pSuppose I have a gallery activity with a codeViewPagercode that shows one image per page. Do I open my expansion zip file in codeonCreatecode and close it in codeonDestroycode, or do I open and close the file for every new image loadedp

Negative 1597 pI reading a hrefhttpralphschindler.com20120309phpconstructorbestpracticesandtheprototypepattern relnofollowthe following articlea and got very confused on the Dynamic Class Instantiation part. Specifically this code snippetp  precodeobj  new className if obj instanceof SomeBaseType      throw new InvalidTypeException  codepre  pI dont understand what this is actually doing for you. If its not an instance of a base class it errors out. How is that helpful It doesnt get an instance of the correct type, or perform a different action based on the current type, it just throws an exception. Im having trouble conceptualizing the purpose of this code and the article didnt really clear it up for me.p  pComplete section from the articlep  pDynamic Class Instantiationp  pGenerally speaking, the following code, while legal, should be used very seldom, and only when other possible instantiation patterns have been exhaustedp  precodeobj  new className if obj instanceof SomeBaseType      throw new InvalidTypeException  codepre  pWhy is this a bad pattern First, it makes the assumption up front that the constructor signature is free from any required parameters. While this is good for object types that are already known to this factory, it might not always be true of a consumers subtype of the base object in question. This patten should never be used on objects that have dependencies, or in situations where it is conceivable that a subtype might have dependencies because this takes away the possibility for a subtype to practice constructor injection.p  pAnother problem is that instead of managing an object, or a list of objects, you are now managing a class name, or list of class names in addition to an object or list of objects. Instead, one could simply manage the objects.p  pIf, on the other hand, you know this particular object type is no more than a value object or similar, with no chance of it needing dependencies in subtypes, you can then cautiously use this instantiation pattern.p

Negative 1597 pI want to realise a little game around the use of multithreading.

Negative 1597 pI have a WPF listview and the ScrollViewer shows if large list. The ListView contains items with a checkbox element. We provide the ability to the users to select all and unselect all.p  pThe issue I experienced is only with larger list, meaning we see a subset of the elements and the user needs to use the Scroll Bar to view the rest of the elements. My code for selecting all elements and deselecting all elements is using the VisualTreeHelper helper class to set the property IsChecked of the checkbox to true or false. However it only works for the elements that are visible.  For example if I had a collection with 14 checkboxes where 10 checkboxes are visible on the screen, it only selects the 10 that are visible.  However, prior to clicking Select All, if you scroll up and down and view the items, then it selects all 14...so it appears that the VisualTree only loads the elements needed. Is there a way to force it to load all elements  p  pI was able to get it to work by disabling the ScrollViewer on the ListView and surrounding it with a ScrollViewer.  Is this the correct approachp  pstrongBeforestrongp  precodeltListView xNamelstProducts ItemsSourceBinding Products ItemContainerStyleStaticResource STYLELISTVIEWITEM Grid.Row1 Margin4 SelectionModeMultiple gt codepre  pstrongSolution that worksstrongp  precodeltScrollViewer HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityHidden VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto Grid.Row1gt                     ltListView xNamelstProducts ItemsSourceBinding Products ItemContainerStyleStaticResource STYLELISTVIEWITEM Grid.Row1 Margin4 SelectionModeMultiple ScrollViewer.CanContentScrollFalse ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityDisabled ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibilityDisabled gt ltScrollViewergt codepre  pPlease advisep

Negative 1597 pI have three classes, a test class, a shape class, and a geometricObject class. The shape class extends the geometricObject class geometricObject class is abstract. The thing is, the shape class and the geometricObject have the same toString method but the contents of the two are different. When I call the toString method in the test class, I get the results from the toString method in the shape class. When I try to cast the object I created into the geometricObject class and try to call upon the toString method there, I still get the same result from the shape class toString method. So does the superclass overwrite methods in abstractsubclasses if they have the same nameargument listp

Negative 1597 pHi iam creating an android application. In my application i have some form fields like edittext and radio buttons i am creating a codeJSONObjectcode by retrieving text from all the form fields. JsonObject is created successfully. Now i want to pass this object to my PHP page where i have written code for getting this details and storing it in database. My problem is i am not understanding how to send this JSON object through codehttpPostcode or codehttpGetcode method. Only way i know is send parameters through codeListltNameValuePairgtcode so im trying to convert JSONObject to codeListltNameValuePairgtcode. Can anybody provide a method which can directly convert my JSONObject to codeListltNameValuePairgtcode. Is there any predefined method for doing this. Or can any one provide solution where i can directly send by JSONObject to PHP and retrieve there.p

Sorted by distance. But even when I only have one beacon near. e.g around 50 cm from my device the proximity changes from immediate, to near and far. It just jumps around. p  pIs there any way to do this more precise In my code I now have a check where I check if the distance changed at least one time before confirming the change.

Workflow Manager made all the databases needed to persist the workflow instances and the Workflow Management Site in the IIS. Then Ive published my workflow service into a zip file and imported this into my Workflow Management Site.p  pEverything was fine and running when I had shut down my computer two days ago. Now my Workflow Manager Backend service wont start anymore.

I dont think this is the same certificate that is used for the communication between the service and an external application.p  pMaybe I could change something in the Workflow Manager configuration but this tool doesnt start. Probably because the service isnt started.

Negative 1597 pI am trying to make a web page that allows the user to submit information about an object using input boxes and a save button. So far I have found it relatively easy to get the page to work for names, numbers etc. using basic types like strings, integers, booleans and doubles. I can enter this basic information into the input boxes and get the information to save into the database by hitting the save button. p  pHowever, the last input field that I need to get working is the Location field. This field is saved as a complex type called LatLng containing Latitude and Longitude values. I have been able to get the input boxes to display properly using the razor HTML form element EditorFor. It automatically creates two input boxes one for Lat and one for Long.p  pEXp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAqEUL.png altenter image description here p  pBut it seems that no matter what I input into these boxes the value stored in the database is always lat0, long0. p  pBy setting a break point in my model file I have found out that the by the time it gets to the model the value variable inside the set in Location is already 0,0. p  pSo my Question is Is there something wrong with my code that would cause the value passed from the EditorFor text boxes to be zeroed before reaching my model file Or is there some way that will allow me to debug this deeperp  pThis code is from my view page.

Negative 1597 pI have a requirement to insert a blank page after every page when an SSRS report is printedexported to PDF, however this needs to be controlled via a parameter.p  pThe reason for this requirement is that when the report is printed each page of data needs to be printed onto a separate piece of paper, however the majority of printers are set to double sided by default. Users arent able to change the default setting except on each occasion they print. Unfortunately this double sided print setting isnt applied everywhere so there needs to be an ability to control the additionremoval of blank pages.p  pI am able to force a blank page to be created after every page by simply setting the size of the report bigger than the page size, though it isnt possible to control page width size via an expression.p  pMy only thought is that this may be possible via custom code but dont really know where to start with that.p

Negative 1597 pIm using AnkhSVN in Visual Studio 2013 and grabbing code from an Unfuddle repository. Im not a dev, but my job is devadjacent and Id like to be able to look at peoples code.p  pIn VS, I can figure out how to get a local copy of the solution file using the Unfuddle repository URL, but I cant figure out how to update the solution to the latest version. When I rightclick on the solution in Solution Explorer, theres no update option, and in the Pending Changes window, Update is grayed out. p  pSo when I want to get latest, I go to Repository Explorer in VS, click the connect icon, enter the URL for the repository. Then I rightclick on the file I want to copy over, and select Copy to Working Copy. I choose a location, and VS informs me that it is not in a working copy would I like to export the file instead I say yes, and it copies everything over. p  pI have to do this whole process every time I want to get latest. What am I doing wrong p  pThanksp
Negative 1597 pIm trying to get my head around this issue where I am using the Entity Framework 6 in an Ntier application. Since data from the repository which contains all communication with the database should be used in a higher tier the UI, services etc, I need to map it to DTOs.p  pIn the database, theres quite a few manytomany relationships going on, so the datastructure canwill get complex somewhere along the line of the applications lifetime.

This is, of course, not ideal.p  pI have read a lot about the famous AutoMapper framework that can map entites tofrom DTOs, but since I have these manytomany relations it quickly feels bloated with AutoMapper config code.

Negative 1597 pa hrefhttpsjcp.orgaboutJavacommunityprocessfinaljsr318index.html relnofollowJSR000318a spec defines the TimerService chapter 18.p  pGiven an EJB, you can create an strongautomatic timerstrong or a strongprogrammatic timerstrong.p  pAn strongautomatic timerstrong looks like thisp  precodeSchedules    Schedulehour12, dayOfWeekMonThu,   Schedulehour11, dayOfWeekFri  public void sendLunchNotification  ...  codepre  pWhile a strongprogrammatic timerstrong looks like thisp  precodeResource private TimerService timerService  void someMethod    ScheduleExpression exp  new ScheduleExpression    ... set exp ...    TimerConfig config  new TimerConfig    ... set config ...    Timer created  timerService.createCalendarTimerexp,config  codepre  pWhen a strongprogrammatic timerstrong is created, the task to be triggered by the timer is that one annotated with Timeoutp  pMy question, since I could not find it clearly stated in the JSR, if a create 2 strongprogrammatic timersstrong for the same EJB using the same ScheduleExpression, the container must call the Timeout method strongtwicestrong or strongoncestrongp  pTo make my question clearer.p  pLets suppose Ive created 2 programmatic timers. Each one has a different metadata stored in the serializable timer INFO attribute. Then, Id like to have two different timers, and when the Timeout method executes, it would get this INFO attribute to choose what to do.p  pIf the answer of my question is strongtwicestrong, than I can do it. If the answer of my question is strongoncestrong, then I cannot. p  pNotice that if the answer is strongoncestrong, it makes some sense from the performance point of view, because you dont actually need to notify the EJB more than once for a given moment, even if you have several triggers for it, but if you are planning to deal with these triggers independently because each one has a different INFO, then someone is just ignoring the attempt to create a timer when theres already one persisted.p

Negative 1597 pWe are using a CMS application developed in asp.net 4 with URL rewrite extension. Our application is hosting thousands of CMS pages and in solution Response.Redirect has been numerously used with URLs containing UPPER CASE letters.

So, we need to maintain two ways of retrieving data and also then formatting data accordingly in both cases.p

Negative 1597 pLately, I have been working on a project in Ruby on Rails thats been taking data from a MySQL database and converting it into a fully working Microsoft Office Word .docx document.

Can someone please help me why this is and what I can do to solve itp blockquote  pIn addition, I know that normally port mapping is done between the architecture declaration and the begin statement of the architecture. The reason I placed them after the process is because I needed to make sure that bin has the right signal before the other components can use it.

Negative 1597 pI am working in Eclipse but running my code in Nuke. Nuke uses PySide, but its built into Nuke so Eclipse cant parse it. I cannot install PySide in my environment VFX studio rules but I do have PyQt4. So I can change my import from PySide to PyQt4 and it parses correctly in Eclipse  but it will error when loading Nuke. So what I need is a way to get EclipsePyDev to use PyQt4 while Nuke uses PySide. I thought perhaps I could use PyDevs String Substitution scheme but either it doesnt do what I want or Im not using it right. Any help is greatly appreciatedp  pDenp
Negative 1597 pThe documentation of the codetryLockcode method says that it is a nonblocking methodbr which allows you to obtainacquire the lock if thats possible at the time of calling  the method.   p  pBut I wonder how can you obtain a lock and still guarantee at the same time thatbr your method codetryLockcode is nonblocking Acquiring the lock implies that yourebr trying to access a guarded section of code so it should block if youre not luckybr i.e. you should block at least in certain scenarios. Could anyone explain the logicbr behind this Purely from a logical standpoint I dont quite understand how this canbr be done at all guaranteeing that the method doesnt block.

Negative 1597 pUsing a URL based call to retrieve build status on Jenkins  what is the cleanest and easiest way to calculate  remaining on a buildp  pI have looked at using codeestimatedDurationcode with codetimestampcode from the returned JSON and then calculating that against servers current timestamp, but I am having issues because my calling servers timestamp is off by a bit from what the jenkins server codetimestampcode is not to mention TZ differences and the servers are hosted with different providers  I cannot fix the problem with the timestamps directly.. beyond that it seems a bit loose to rely upon two different servers timestamps to calculate anything if it can be avoided..p  pADDITIONAL INFO The Jenkins JSON url I am using is in this format codehttpjenkinsserverurljobjenkinsjobnamejenkinsjobnumberapijsoncodep  pIt contains the codeestimatedDurationcode and job start codetimestampcode referred above.

Negative 1597 pI have a working Wafefront program using MPI express. What happens in this program is that for a matrix of coden x mcode there are codencode processes. Each process is assigned a row. Each process does the followingp  precodefor column  0 to matrixwidth do     1 x  get the value of this column from the row above rank  1 process     2 y  Get the value left of us our row, column1     3 Add to our current column value x  y codepre  pSo on the master process I will declare an array of coden x mcode elements. Each slave process should thus strongallocatestrong an array of length codemcode. But as it stands in my solution each process has to strongallocatestrong an array of coden x mcode for the scatter operation to work, otherwise I get a nullpointer if I assign it codenullcode or an out of bounds exception if I instantiate it with codenew int[1]code. Im sure there has to be a solution to this, otherwise each process would require as much memory as the root.p  pI think I need something like allocatable in C.p  pBelow the important part is the one marked MASTER. Normally I would pull the initialization into the codeifrank  0code test and initialize the array with codenullcode not allocating the memory in the else branch but that does not work.p  precodepackage be.ac.vub.ir.mpi  import mpi.MPI  Execute mpjrun.sh np 2 jar parsymjava.jar     Parallel and sequential implementation of a prime number counter   public class WaveFront       Default program parameters     final static int size  4     private static int rank     private static int worldsize      private static void logString message              if rank  0             System.out.printlnmessage                 MAIN           public static void mainString[] args throws InterruptedException               MPI variables         int[] matrix          matrix stored at process 0         int[] row             each process keeps its row         int[] receiveBuffer   to receive a value from row  1         int[] sendBuffer      to send a value to row  1                    INIT                    MPI.Initargs         rank  MPI.COMMWORLD.Rank         worldsize  MPI.COMMWORLD.Size                    ALL PCS                     initialize data structures         receiveBuffer  new int[1]         sendBuffer  new int[1]         row  new int[size]                    MASTER                   matrix  new int[size  size]         if rank  0                       Initialize matrix             for int idx  0 idx lt size  size idx                 matrix[idx]  0             matrix[0]  1             receiveBuffer[0]  0                             PROGRAM                    distribute the rows of the matrix to the appropriate processes         int startOfRow  rank  size         MPI.COMMWORLD.Scattermatrix, startOfRow, size, MPI.INT, row, 0, size, MPI.INT, 0           For each column each process will calculate its new values.         for int colidx  0 colidx lt size colidx                       Get Y from row above us rank  1.             if rank gt 0                 MPI.COMMWORLD.RecvreceiveBuffer, 0, 1, MPI.INT, rank  1, 0              Get the X value left from current column.             int x  colidx  0  0  row[colidx  1]               Assign the new Z value.             row[colidx]  row[colidx]  x  receiveBuffer[0]               Wait for other process to ask us for this value.             sendBuffer[0]  row[colidx]             if rank  1 lt size                 MPI.COMMWORLD.SendsendBuffer, 0, 1, MPI.INT, rank  1, 0                    At this point each process should be done so we call gather.

Negative 1597 pi started working with asp.net and i have encountered a problem when i try to edit multiple values from a table. I have a bookmark tables which is connected to another tag table, with an 1  N relationship. My problem is when i want to edit already existing tags associated with an existing url. I can disply them on the page but when i try to post the edited data i dont know how to pick it up in the controller.

Negative 1597 pIm working on a logging framework that will send hierarchical metrics to a Graphite server represented as strings separated by dots, e.g., site.loginpage.pageload. To keep naming consistent across several teams, developers shouldnt be able to send freeform text, since it will potentially impact metrics aggregation by having different namespaces. My initial thoughts are to use an enump  precodepublic enum WaitingRoomMetrics              CheckIn,         WaitTime        LogTimeMetricInMs WaitingRoomMetrics.CheckIn, 900000 codepre  pThis would prevent developers from creating inconsistent freeform metrics like thisp  precodeLogTimeMetricInMs waitingroom.checkin, 300000 LogTimeMetricInMs waitingroom.TotalwaitTime, 900000 codepre  pCurrently, my interface definition for LogTimeInMetrics isp  precodeinterface LogTimeInMetrics Enum metric, long timeInMs codepre  pWhile developers could create their own enums, it doesnt really solve the problem of enforcing consistency. Ideally, Id like to have a different Nuget package for each discrete component that has all metrics available for that application component.  Developers can then install the Nuget packages for any metrics they need to expose. However, enums still feel a bit simplistic and they still give developers too much free reign, unless we provide enforcement at the code checkinpull request review.p  pBasically, Im looking to have a Metrics.Base package which would contain some kind of a base type that has builtin validation. All metrics would need to inherit from that base clase. The interface would then look likep  precode interface LogTimeInMetrics BaseMetric metric, long timeInMs codepre  pBut it feels like building a separate class for each metric is overkill and could be an administrative nightmarebasically each metric is just a ToString. Is there a better model to manage a large list of basically Enumtype values managed across several Nuget packages, provide Intellisense and some sense of namespacenaming convention enforcementvalidation Or forego Intellisense and just maintain a collection of constantsp

I have window.MYSCOPE set to view the contents of scope in the console and can access the coordinates using data.features[0].geometry.geometry[coordinates] and this will display in a browser as text but I cant seem to pass it to an embedded Leaflet script and its very unwieldy as a variable, and I work out how to extract the values, either as an array or as pair of variable in an external script.  Using a loop seems to be the answer although the query will only return one record and I cant get a loop or two to return the coordinates. Ive been stuck on this for a while now and cant find an example that matches the situation. I have control of the backend so I can change the output if necessary. Does anyone have any insights into thisp  pEDIT as answered by iH8, Im not returning valid GeoJSON, in the first instance as it had nested geometries, which I have fixed, but also because I am trying to deliver other information with the GeoJSON data as properties, which doesnt validate. p  pThe answer on the DRF side is that I have nested serializers to include the GeoJSON in the data response using a hrefhttpsgithub.comdjangonautsdjangorestframeworkgis relnofollowdjangorestframeworkgisa and having both serializers using GeoFeatureModelSerializer, which creates the nested output below. Changing the model with the property information to GeoModelSerializer presents the geo component as a feature and its associated data as properties but not the nested model. Ill spend a bit of time trying to turn it into a valid GeoJSON object but the answer could ultimately to make multiple requests for the page data, which isnt optimal but may be the simplest solution.p  pUPDATE after two weeks of head scratching I have managed to get valid geojson from my queryset using by defining values and using djangogeojsons serializer.

Negative 1597 pApparently i did not understand codeasyncawaitcode yet and the following basic example already causes some headachep  pFor test purposes i create a Window which represents my UI for now and i want to fire an asynchronous method which does some work in the background when the window opens. I added a codeListviewcode to my window to test if the UI is responding.p  pWhen i execute the following code, two things happen that i do not understandp  ol liMy codeListViewcode shows the codeCustomObjectscode that i define in the constructor. Since i could not use the await keyword in my constructor, I was expecting that the call of codeGetWebResponseAsync.ConfigureAwaitfalsecode would block my UIThread and produce a deadlock like replacing the call with codeGetWebResponseAsync.Waitcode is doing. It seems like codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode already makes my method run on another thread even though i did not run it as a task or await itli liThe UI shows up, but freezes while the codeAsynccode method is running. This is actually not unexpected but confuses me if i consider the previous observation that the Listview is apparently accessible from the code while i perform my async method. Doesnt that mean that my UIThread is NOT blocked and thus I should be able to interact with the UIli ol  pSince i got stuck here, i would also like to know how i can properly call my async method in the constructor right away. If i use codeawait GetWebResponseAsync.ConfigureAwaitfalsecode it doesnt compile since my constructor does not have the codeasynccode keyword. However i know by now that i should not use codeasync voidcode and even if i try to make my constructor an codeasync voidcode method, it doesnt compile because codemember names can not be the same as their enclosing typecode.p  precodepublic partial class TitleWindow  Window      public TitleWindow              InitializeComponent           I can not use this because the constructor is not async.

Negative 1597 pIn Odoo 8 you can create an email alias for a project which will create a task for that project for all incoming emails.  This works great until you enable etherpad.  Once etherpad is enabled the task name comes through from the email subject but the description of the task is left blank.  How do you make it so the new task created also creates an etherpad related to that task  It seems like it should be out of the box functionality that I dont have configured properly, but I cannot find it.

Negative 1597 pI am likely just not searching this the right way, but I have no idea how to add a sub directory to a website, you know www.websitenameHOWDOIADDTHISPARTp  pI have my index.html set up but now I want to add pages and have made some with html but not sure how to link to them, my index.html works with  www.websitenameindex.html so i figured i could link the html name but it doesnt do anything. i get 404 not found of coursep  pas I said i have been looking, for over an hour, it seems like an easy enough thing, it is pretty essential to any website, but I just cant find an answer. I would really appreciate anything, a link, correction of wording, whatever. p  pthanks p
Negative 1597 pI have one form in PHP, where I can dynamically add or remove rows using jquery for that, with select boxes. So, when I click in a button to add another row, I added the content using the .after method, example p  precodevar cntclass  2 var count  1   adiciona classe addlineclass.clickfunction     tbladdclass tr.last.afterlttrgtlttdgtltstronggtClasseltstronggtampnbspltselect nameclasseletter[count] idclasselettergtltphp whilersmainclassgtEOF  gtltoption valueltrsmainclassgtFieldsclassgtgtltrsmainclassgtFieldsclassgtltoptiongtltphp rsmainclassgtMoveNext  rsmainclassgtMoveFirst gtltselectgtlttdgtlttdgtltstronggtLugaresltstronggtampnbspltinput typetext nameclasspax[count] idclasspax value0 size5gtlttdgtlttrgt alertclassletter[1]     cntclass     count  codepre  pWhat I pretend is retrieve the values of select box by the name classletter.

Weve resorted to connecting every label to an codeIBOutletcode and setting its translation in codeviewDidLoadcode with codeNSLocalizedStringcode.p  pXcode choking when it attempts to export a code.stringscode file containing an apostrophe beggars belief.p  pIt also seems theres an underlying assumption that if the development language in Xcode is English, then the developers are in charge of the English translation. I can imagine no context outside that of a singleperson indie developer shop where this is true.p  pFinally, it also seems Im missing something about how the tools Ive attempted to use structure their workflows. If anyone could enlighten me Id be quite grateful.p  pHas anyone managed to construct a workable localization workflow where the developers arent charged with ultimate editing control over the development language and the code.stringscode files checked into the repository are the source of truthp

Negative 1597 pI saw that its a very common thing to use the Visual Studio Macro called codeConfigurationcode for build file paths.p  pFor example if you create a new Visual C Project in Visual Studio 2013 your default Property Sheet will look something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdSfMQ.png altDefault Visual Studio VC Property Sheetp  pThe codeConfigurationcode Macro is the Name of the current Project Configuration. If you do not rename your configurations or create new ones, you will be able to add codeConfigurationcode everywhere where you need to set either codeDebugcode or codeReleasecode. This way, you can set a configuration property for strongAll Configurationsstrong instead of going to every Release or Debug configuration and setting it separately.p  pBut what if you decide to rename your configurations And you want them to be built into the same codeReleasecode or codeDebugcode directory instead of having a new folder for every configuration Is there still a way to get a Macro or define one that says codeDebugcode or codeReleasecode even if the configuration is named otherwisep

As long as the images arent well beyond 10k x 5k pixels, I do not seem to encounter problems. However, once I get beyond that limit, I get IOStream Errors and out of memory errors.

If you load up huge images larger than 10k x 5k depending on your pc, it will sometimes crash.p  pIm sort of lost here, since I cannot think of anything to catch errors, since an out of memory error can occur at any time I have caught the ioerror by replacing the preview image with a blank image, however, the main image must be guaranteed to load.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 1597 pBeen working on this for quite sometime now and nothing seems to work. I need to make a vigenere cypher which takes in a key word as argy[1] and then get a string and using those two, do what a vigenere cypher does in which the letters A and a in the keyword correspond to a shift of 0 and z and Z correspond to a shift of 25. Cases upper and lower must be preserved and any non alphabetical character in the string must not be enciphered and as such the letters in the keyword itself should not be used up until the next alphabetical character is there. Thats the basic rundown... p  pI will post my code. Please dont focus on the actual math behind the problem i can figure that part out myself but rather the use of modulus and my loops. Right now Im only working on the if the character in the string is lowercase case. p  pThe program complies and seems to work with single letter combination wheras with an argv[1] of b and a string a the output is b. However two letter keywords produce more enciphered letters then letters within the string how do i fix this. Also, Im having a hard time with getting the keyword to wrap around to the first letter when it has used up all its letters in the case where the are more alphabetical characters in the string then the key word. p  pPlease look at my code, any help is highly appreciated  p  pJust to avoid confusion, This is C.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltcs50.hgt include ltctype.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainint argc, string argv[]  int a   argc      if a  2      return 1       string b  argv [1]  int c  strlenb string m  for int d  0 d lt c d      if  isdigitb[d]  ispunctb[d]  isspaceb[d]               return 1            m  GetString   for int i  0, n  strlenm i lt n i      if islowerm[i]              for int j  0 j lt c j                                            if j gt c                                              j  1                   printfc, m[i]b[j]2685                           else                              printfc, m[i]b[j]2685                                                                               codepre  pThanks again p

Negative 1597 pI have a Access 2013 Database with two tables, a Header and a Detail.  Each Header record is linked to multiple Detail records.  I have created a form that displays a single Header record at a time and the Detail records linked to that Header record.  When you change to a different Header record the subform changes to the records linked to that new header record. I have filtered Header records based on certain criteria by use of the Filter property on the form and setting Filter on Load to Yes. My problem is that I also need to filter the Detail records based on certain criteria, but when I try to do it the same way as the Header it doesnt filter.p  pThanks in advance for the guidance.p

Would this be correctp  pI should also say that users may alternatively be parents rather than teachers, and so would I would have a separate strongParentsstrong model for all the properties and so on associated with parentsp  pI would then pass only the Teacher model object into the view and thus gain access to all the teacher info such as personal details and array of lesson types.p  pAs Im typing, this is sounding more and more to me like the right way to go, but it would be great to get some advice.p  p1  technical implementation I guess in the Teacher model, Id populate all the relevant teacher into class variables Name, array of lessons etc in the constructorp  p2  am I over complicating this structure by having both Users AND Users details tablesp  p3  Does what Im proposing make the most structural sense in Laravelp  p4  just another thought Ive just had, should the teacherID in the lessontype table actually refer to the User table rather than the Userdetail table... so userdetail and lessontype would both be direct children of the user tablep  pstrongVerystrong much obliged for any help p

Going forward its possible it could be 100,000.p  pThe rows will be unique if I group on the first three columns listed above. I have read I can use the unique constraint on multiple columns which will guarantee the rows are unique.p  pI think Im correct in saying that the unique constraint by default sets up nonclustered index. Would a clustered index be better amp assuming when the table starts to contain millions of rows this wont cause any issuesp  pMy last question. By applying the unique constraint on my table I am right to say querying the data will be quicker than if the unique constraint wasnt applied because of the nonclustering or clustering amp uploading the data will be slower which is fine with the constraint on the tablep

given users attempt to find Facebook friends yielded this problem. Since this is PHP Facebook SDK, I really do not understand what application should be installed. As far as I know, the user has to allow the Facebook application and grant the necessary privileges. However, the exception message states that an application was not installed. I have absolutely no idea why this error has been thrown, therefore I have no idea how to reproduce it. Any ideas about what might be the problem Thanks.p

Negative 1597 pIm hoping someone can help me as Im beating my head against a wall trying to figure out the problem.  I have a databound CheckboxList that has the SelectedIndexChanged event wired up.  AutoPostBack is equal to true and ViewStateMode and EnableViewState are set to Enabled and True respectively.  I have other controls on this same page with server side events that fire just fine with no issue.p  pThe weird thing is, the event SEEMS to be firing, as I can see the page reload when I check one of the items in the list.  However, when I set a debug point on the method, the debugger never breaks into that section and none of my code is firing Ive even tried having it write out silly messages just to see if the method is even firing  its not.

I tried asking a question previously, but its hard without much background in computers, so I got no answer, and a down vote. So Im trying again making it more concrete.]p  pI have a codeghpagescode branch a hrefhttpsgithub.comRInterestedStuff relnofollowherea, which I labeled it codeStuffcode, and contains an codeindex.htmlcode file, accessible through this address a hrefhttprinterested.github.ioStuff relnofollowhttprinterested.github.ioStuffa online. This is the Home or anchor page of the website, but I want to create other pages within a hrefhttprinterested.github.ioStuff relnofollowhttprinterested.github.ioStuffa. To this effect, I have been unsuccessfully playing with a toy document that at this point is within the same codeghpagescode folder and labeled codePlottingWithR.mdcode. Why code.mdcode Because after much searching online it got a lead indicating that this would turn the page into html... Dont ask.p  pWell, its not working. Although the codeindex.htmlcode is clearly accessible online the codePlottingWithR.mdcode doesnt seem to be. So can you please help me with whatever I am doing wrong preferably working directly with Github not git to get this extra page published online, and linked to codeindex.htmlcodep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1597 pIm using Tampermonkey to collect data from pages I visit and store it locally and persistently across browser sessions.  This is working fine.

So I was wondering whether it is possible to write such a codeSetcode where all five operations codesizecode, codecontainscode, codeaddcode, coderemovecode and coderandomElementcode are codeO1codep

It sometime very rare works.p  pIs there any better approachp

Negative 1597 pIm having an issue with Gravity forms Google noCaptcha reCaptcha Wordpress Plugin. The popup image picker after you check the box it pops up is going off of the screen in a mobile size window. Its the only element that does that, so Im lead to believe that its not an issue with my styling. Has this ever happened to anyone before Ive tried researching it but the only thing I can find is talking about the Im Not a Robot box not being responsive, which is NOT my issue here.  Heres an image of the site before the box is checked p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comJjvy2.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJjvy2.png altenter image description hereap  pAnd here is an image of after its checkedp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comRqsIJ.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRqsIJ.png altenter image description hereap  pThanks in advancep
Negative 1597 pI understand the basic gist of using not in CSS, but it doesnt seem to work for me.  I am trying to do something likep  precodeinput[typetext][readonly]not.class1, .class2  backgroundcolor DDDDDD color 1E1E1E  codepre  pBut this does nto seem to work for me.  whenever I read any information on this, it will have examples like codeinputnot.class1, .class2 code, but nothing between the tag and the codenotcode part.  Am I correct in assuming that the syntax I have written is incorrect  Can I not define the tag element any more if I use codenotcodep

Negative 1597 pOur solution has many dependencies that are not references, they are script files whole Python projects using code.pyprojcode and DLLs loaded using reflection MEF actually.p  pWe are using post build events to copy those files to the correct output directory when compiling the main exe. This has become unwieldy since we now have multiple entry exes that need those files and the amount of copies done is unmanageable. p  pThis creates two problems first, synchronizing all the projects to use the same sequence of post build events second, xcopying the files seems to fail sometimes and from our experience is not always reliable.p  pAre there more manageable alternatives for copying build outputs at compile time without using xcopy in post build eventsp
