Positive 81474 pI am migrating a Windows Phone 7.8  application from to Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight  and ultimately possibly to Windows Phone 10.. p  pBut now I am stuck in a triviality of not getting Background Audio Player to work in Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight at all.

If I implement the exact same WCF client specific code in a WPF desktop application, no exception will be thrown. I can confirm that the service works fine, and the windows phone application works fine as well as long as I remove the Thread.Sleep61000. In my realworld production scenario which this simplified example reflects, the client has to be able to wait for longer than one minute without throwing a CommunicationException. Since the example works if I do the same thing from a WPF application, Im suspecious that the problem relates to a limitation on the Windows Phone platform. But I cant find any information that states that WCF calls cant take any longer than one minute on Windows Phone.p  pFurthermore Ive tried setting the OperationTimeout on the client proxy like sop  precodeclient.InnerChannel.OperationTimeout  TimeSpan.FromMinutes5.0 codepre  pBut with no luck. Any suggestions are welcome.p

Positive 81474 pHi Ive spent a long time trying to get my jquery mobile v1.4.5 and cordova v5.3.1 app running on WP8.1. It runs fine on iOS and Android. I am aware of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15248911jquerymobilechangepagenotworkinginwindowsphonethis SO questiona, and the problem Im having is not related to this, or any others on SO.p  pChangepage seems to get stuck on WP8.1 because it thinks my app is still in a page transitioning state.

Positive 81474 pI am building an application using IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 6.3 for windows phone 8 and I have a flow like this.p  pIn page A the user taps a button and navigates to page B. In Page B the user taps another button and a call is initiated. If the call returns successfully then the user is taken to page C. p  pPage A corresponds to ViewModel Avm and the other to ViewModels Bvm and Cvm. So the call in page B is initiated by a command in Bvm and the return is also handled there. p  pThe problem is this flow. The user initiates the call on page B, then before the call returns, presses Back and navigates to page A. However the Bvm still exists so when the call returns the user is taken to page C from page A. This is not permitted behavior. p  pUnfortunately MobileFirst does not support cancelling requests so I cannot do that when navigating from the page.p  pWhat I have tried Setting a bool variable in Bvm that determines whether page B is the active page when the call returns and updating it on the OnNavigatedTo and OnNavigatedFrom events of the page, creates a race condition. If the call returns while navigation is occuring then it is not certain if the variable will be set in time. The same goes for any change I can do on the navigation events.p  pDo you have any suggestion as to how I can face this problem.  Maybe a way to dispose of the view model in time before the call returns.p  pEDIT More specific data and code.

Negative 81474 pI have several log files of events one event per line. The logs can possibly overlap. The logs are generated on separate client machines from possibly multiple time zones but I assume I know the time zone. Each event has a timestamp that was normalized into a common time by instantianting each log parsers calendar instance with the timezone appropriate to the log file and then using getTimeInMillis to get the UTC time. The logs are already sorted by timestamp. Multiple events can occur at the same time, but they are by no means equal events.p  pThese files can be relatively large, as in, 500000 events or more in a single log, so reading the entire contents of the logs into a simple Event[] is not feasible.p  pWhat I am trying do is merge the events from each of the logs into a single log. It is kinda like a mergesort task, but each log is already sorted, I just need to bring them together. The second component is that the same event can be witnessed in each of the separate log files, and I want to remove duplicate events in the file output log.p  pCan this be done in place, as in, sequentially working over some small buffers of each log file I cant simply read in all the files into an Event[], sort the list, and then remove duplicates, but so far my limited programming capabilities only enable me to see this as the solution. Is there some more sophisticated approach that I can use to do this as I read events from each of the logs concurrentlyp

Negative 81474 pAt the moment we have a problem with the startup of a middlesized WPFapplication. It takes about 15 seconds to load completly. We wondered what it takes that long.p  pIn the event ApplicationStartup of App.xaml a controller gets initialised.

This assemblies are relative small, 160k and 60k.p  pThe time it takes to enter this event was 15 seconds. So we separated the code in another method and call it in the event.

Negative 81474 pI am trying to write some integration tests for some SQL server stored procedures and functions. Id like to have a database that has a known set of test data in it, and then wrap each test in a transaction, rolling it back when complete so that tests are effectively independent. p  pThe stored proceduresfunctions do anything from fairly simple join queries, to complex filtering with many layers of joins, to insertion of data to multiple tables.p  pThere are a couple stored procedures that actually use transactions  and so these are harder to test. Ill show an example of the overall code that is executed, but keep in mind this would normally be in two different spots test setupteardown, and the actual stored procedure. For this sample, Im also using a very simple temp tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE test    val nvarchar500  codepre  pExamplep  precode for this example, just ensuring that the table is empty delete from test go    begin of test setup code  begin transaction  go  end of test setup code        begin of code under test      insert into test valuesaaaa      begin transaction      go          insert into test valuesbbbbb      rollback transaction      go      insert into test valuesccccc       Example select 1     select  from test       end of code under test    begin of test teardown  rollback transaction  go  end of test teardown   checking that temp is still empty, like it was before test    Example select 2 select  from test codepre  pThe problem here is that at Example select 1, I would expect aaaa and cccc to be in the table, but actually only cccc is in the table, as SQL Server actually rolls back ALL transactions see a hrefhttpabdulaleemkhan.blogspot.com200607nestedtsqltransactions.html relnofollowhttpabdulaleemkhan.blogspot.com200607nestedtsqltransactions.htmla. In addition, the second rollback causes an error, and although this can be avoided withp  precode begin of test teardown  if trancount gt 0  begin     rollback transaction  end go  end of test teardown codepre  pit doesnt solve the real problem at Example select 2, we still get cccc in the table  it no longer gets rolled back because there is no transaction active.p  pIs there a way around this Is there a better strategy for this type of testingp  pNote Im not sure if the codebase ever does do anything after rollback or not the insert cccc part  but if it ever does, either intentionally or accidentally, it would be possible for tests to break in strange ways as unexpected data can be left over from another test. p  hr  pSomewhat similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2073737nestedstoredprocedurescontainingtrycatchrollbackpatternhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2073737nestedstoredprocedurescontainingtrycatchrollbackpatterna but there is no real solution to the problem posed here.p

These words are populated to the textblock from code behind as it could be a different 700 words depending on some stuff. There is a textbox on this form as well. The user types the words in the textblock into the textbox. As they type i keep track of which word from the textblock they are on.

Negative 81474 pA client recently informed us that deployment of our software in their environment has failed due to a proxy error when the software attempts to access the internet.p  pThe client has a combination of Citrix and Microsofts ISA server.p  pThe software allows the use of a proxy and the ability to manually enter authentication information, or automatically retrieve the current system proxy settings.p  pThe error returned is the standard 407 authentication error, but the client assures us that they have entered the authentication information required.

Negative 81474 pThis question has less to do with actual code, and more to do with the underlying methods.p  pMy boss at my pseudointernship has requested that I write him a script that will scrape a list of links from a users tweet the list comes round once per week, and its always the same user and then publish said list to the companys Tumblr account.p  pCurrently, I am thinking about this structure The base will be a bash script that first calls some script that uses the Twitter API to find the post given a hashtag and parse the list current candidates for languages being Perl, PHP and Ruby, in no particular order. Then, the script will store the parsed list with some markup into a text file, from where another script that uses the Tumblr API will format the list and then post it.p  pIs this a sensible way to go about doing this So far in planning Im only up to getting the Twitter post, but Im already stuck between using the API to grab the post or just grabbing the feed they provide and attempting to parse it. I know its not really a big project, but its certainly the largest one Ive ever started, so Im paralyzed with fear when it comes to making decisionsp

Negative 81474 pIm trying to set a subclassed codeNSOpenGLViewcode in an unusual way and I am running into some problems. Basically, I am writing a program to perform a bioengineering simulation for my PhD and I need to be able to compile it under both MacOSX and Unix my machine is a Mac, but the sim will eventually run on a more powerful Unix machine. Since the code will get longer and longer over the next year and a half Id rather not have to keep track of two completely different versions of the program. So, Im hoping to be able to compile the ObjectiveC code under Unix by avoiding ObjectiveC2.0 and keeping the interface optional it will mostly be there to perform setup before the long simulations and monitor things for the short ones during development.p  pThe current version works well without the interface  the simulation is performed correctly and the program is capable of rendering OpenGL frames and exporting them into image and video files without any problems. Since I am now adding the interface right now just a simple window with an NSOpenGLView subclass and a start button on top of that so that I can run the code with an alternate version of main without it I have to wire OpenGL together in a weird way, since the drawing code is not in the drawRect function, or even anywhere in the subclassed view, but instead in the basic program.p  pWhat Ive done so far is thisp  ol lipThe main program using an object called Lattice performs all the simulations and rendering, correctly outputing images and video to files. This also contains the codeNSOpenGLContextcode and calls code[renderContext flushBuffer]codepli lipA subclass of NSOpenGLView called PottsView contains an instance of a lattice, which is initialized together with the view like thisp  precode idinitWithFrameNSRectframe      if[super initWithFrameframe]         return nil       code     frameSize.width  WINWIDTH     frameSize.height  WINHEIGHT     [self setFrameSizeframeSize]      initgenrand64time0      latt  [Lattice alloc]      if SEEDTYPE          [latt initWithRandomSites]      else          [latt initWithEllipse]           [[latt context] makeCurrentContext]      return self  codepreli ol  pcodedrawRectcode is empty.p  ol liPottsController is the object instanced in the InterfaceBuilder which connects the start button to the view. The start button simply tells the lattice to run for a number of steps.li ol  pNow, pressing start results in the simulation running correctly i.e. output to files and terminal, but the PottsView is not working correctly. It remains white, but if I cmdtab parts if it change to sections of a rendered frame. Same if I press Expose F3.p  pIve tried several combinations of flushing, codesetNeedsDisplaycode, etc, but frankly speaking Im lost. I havent done any programming before this April and with this being as far as I can tell a completely backwards way of using NSOpenGLView Im out of ideas. Im hoping someone can suggest how I can make the current setup work or how to completely rewire the program while still keeping the interface optional.p

Negative 81474 pI am using the following code do get all data records from a MS SQL database and I try to update every single record. The code is used in a WebService. The issue is, that the code runs fine if I have 1000 data records but now I have 20000 data records an the code first returned with an timeout. Then I set the cmd.CommandTimeout to zero to have no timeout. Now when I invoke the function in the IE WebSvc the IE window is still blank and still try to load something but nothing happens.

Negative 81474 pHi all Im making a system which is essentially a scheduled task system. I have included functionality to email the administrators whenever theres an error, but there needs to be some functionality to not overload the admins emailbox if there is a catastrophic global failure and every job fails.p  pSo far Ive allowed the admin to enter 2 settings  threshold and batch time in minutes. Basically, the threshold is the number of errors that takes place in the batch timebefore mailing is stopped and a batch mail is sent, and after that all error mailing is stopped until the administrator disables a flag.p  pFor example, if threshold is 10 and the time is 30, then after 1 error, it should start adding up the errors until 20 minutes is over , when the counter will be reset, or the number of errors is reached which then enables a flag and disables all mailing.p  pIs that the most efficient way Im trying to wrap my head around how Id do it using my method, but Im open to ideas.p  pThanksp

Negative 81474 pstrongEditstrong Ive rewritten the question in hopes that the goal is a little clearer.p  pThis is an extended question to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions445235generatingrandomresultsbyweightinphpherea, and I really like the function provided in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions445235generatingrandomresultsbyweightinphp445363445363this answera.p  pIn the answer above, one is able to set the probability of hitting an extreme, with higher numbers producing a higher probability of getting lower numbers and viceversa. The issue is that I must set the probabilities for 3 groups. Those groups are Lowest Value LV, Highest Value HV, and Middle Value MV. However, to simplify the request, we can consider codeEVPHVPLVPcode.p  pGiven emanyem range, the HVLV should appear based on the specified EVP and, as you progressdegress through the range from each extreme, the probability of the next value in the range will increase, or decrease, based on the distance between EVP and MVP.p  pUsing an example range of 16, with 1 and 6 being weighted at 5 EVP, the probability spread would be 16 is 5, 24 is 15, and 34 is 30 MVP, totalling 100. The reverse should also be possible, swapping EVP and MVP should produce an inverse of the graph below.p  pHeres an image that I hope will convey the results expected from the given example.p  pstrongMiddle weightedstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWHuK1.png altMiddle Weighted Graphp  pstrongBonusstrong It would be most excellent if I was able to set HVP and LVP separately producing a result similar to the graph below emNote The graph is not accurate to specification aboveem.p  pstrongMiddle weighted bonusstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWW3Em.png altMiddle Weighted Bonus Graphp  pThanksp

Negative 81474 pI always thought that codeConcurrentHashMapcode and similar classes which maintain synchronized updates and dont synchronize reads did a very useful and intuitive thing they did not lock reads and lock all functionality on updates. And a strategy like that does keep all things consistent.p  pBut I read the documentation carefully, and opened the implementation of codeConcurrentHashMapcode, and as I understand now, it emdoes notem block reads when another thread is performing updates. And if one thread starts doing codeputAllhugeCollectioncode and another thread repeats codecontainstheSameObjectForAllCallscode at the same time then its more then likely that the second thread gets different results while codeputAllcode is still working.p  pHere is the related part from the docsp  blockquote   pFor aggregate operations such as   putAll and clear, concurrent   retrievals may reflect insertion or   removal of only some entries.p blockquote  pAnother interesting thing is thatp  blockquote   pRetrievals reflect the results of the   most recently completed update   operations holding upon their onset.p blockquote  pThis works not due to some locking, but because a new object is first being added and only after that objects counter is incremented and the object becomes emvisibleem for read operations.p  pSo, whats the whole point of locking updatesp

Can you see if I can trim this downp  precodejQuery.bannerstyle li.clickfunction      jQuery.bannerstyle li.removeClassselected     jQuerythis.addClassselected     var banner  jQuerythis.attrclass     banner  banner.replace selected,     jQuery.preview img.fadeOutfast,function                          jQuery.preview img.attrsrc,                        httplocalhostsitebannersbanner.jpg                        .fadeInslow                  jQuery.code p.removeClasshide.hide     jQuery.code p.banner.show  codepre  pAlso to note the funny thing is in FF, when you click for the first to on any link, the original image on the right fades out and in real quick and then it loads the clicked image.  This does not happen in other browsers...p

Negative 81474 pHave just had an idea, I havent seen it before, wondering if you guys thought it was a good idea, if it exists, any common pitfalls etc.  and also how to implement it.p  pThere are several times Ive found myself subscribing to an event from the UI thread that will be called from a different thread  for example, notification of a service call completing.p  pMy idea would be to store the current codeDispatchercode in the codeaddcode block along with the handler delegate, then when the event is fired, perform some extra logicchecks to see if there was a dispatcher associated with the handler, and codeInvokecode on it if necessary.p  pOf course it would only work on threads with a codeDispatchercode or Forms equivalent  something with a message pump I guess.  I guess the usefulness and cleanliness depends on whether the event subscriber should have to worry about the thread the handler is called or notp  hr  pEdit Sounds like its not such a bad thing then  additionally does anyone have any idea how to implement  Using codeDelegate.Combinecode how could you call each handler on a different codeDispatchercode, for example  Would you instead store delegates in a composite object in a codeListcode, and invoke them in turn in the codeOnWhatevercode method, or is there something nicerp  p...Looking at the codeBackgroundWorkercode source in Reflector, theres nothing to Invokep  precodeprotected virtual void OnProgressChangedProgressChangedEventArgs e      ProgressChangedEventHandler handler  ProgressChangedEventHandler base.Events[progressChangedKey]     if handler  null              handlerthis, e       codepre  pUnless Im missing somethingp  hr  pSo then codeBackgroundWorkercode does it with an codeAsyncOperationcode.

Negative 81474 pEssentially, my question is emcan this not be done any easierem and what this is, follows below code toop  pI wanted to have a sort of a complement counter function, implemented in VHDL, which would basically invertcomplementnot the counter value in each step, giving slightly richer bit patterns for testing. Of course, I wanted this as synthesizable so the counter value could be possibly assigned to pins and portable code i.e. implemented only IEEE libraries, no codeSTDLOGICARITHcode. I also dont want to by default treat all as unsigned so Id like to avoid codeSTDLOGICUNSIGNEDcode.p  pIn brief, this counter could be described as given initial value C[0], then values at each clock tick would bep  precodeC[i1]  notC[i]    C[i]ltCmax2   0  1  codepre  p... or given C is 16bit wide which will result with unsigned Cmax  65535 and Cmax2  32768, it could also be written asp  precodeC[i1]  65535  C[i]    C[i]lt32768   0  1  codepre  pThe trick here is that the counter should only increment once  if it increases for both complementary and normal ranges, then no changes will happen equation will oscillate between two values.p  pnbspp  pSo, given that the check C[i]ltCmax2 is basically the same as checking the most significant 15th bit of C, I thought that I could easily implement something like this in VHDL using something likep  precodeY lt notY  Y15 codepre  pnbspp  pBoy, was I wrong about easily p  pFirst problem is that it is possible the above equation could end up at 655351, in which case the result will need 17 bits i.e. overflow in my case, Id simply want to truncateignore any carry bits.p  pThis leads into the problem of what to usep  ul licodestdlogicvectorcode has complement codenotcode defined but it doesnt have codecode addition definedli licodenaturalcodecodeintegercode may internally take up 32 bits, and as such bit width for them is not necesarilly specified they support arithmetic codecode, but no complement codenotcodeli liI tried codeunsignedcode too, had some problems also cannot remember whichli ul  pThe 15th MSB bit can only be extracted when Y is codestdlogicvectorcode, in which case, Y15 is a single codestdlogiccode  but then, it needs to be converted to codeintegercode type, because otherwise addition codecode is not defined p  pSo, my current solution below first has two copies of the counter register one is codeSIGNAL wCntReg  STDLOGICVECTOR15 DOWNTO 0code the other is codeSIGNAL tmpna  naturalcode. Thenp  ul liThere are two clocks one master  50 MHz, the other is the counter clock the master 16times frequency divided 3.125 MHz.li liThe counter clock should activate calculation of counter values on falling edgeli liThe calculation is performed via codenaturalcode variable which copies from the codeSTDLOGICVECTORcode oneli liApparently, codestdlogiccode can only be converted to codeintegercode if its converted to codestdlogicvectorcode first I was lucky to find the codevectorizecode function on the net.li ul  pThe nastiest part here was how to feed back the codenaturalcode variable value, back to the codeSTDLOGICVECTORcode one the only working command I could construct isp  precodewCntReg lt stdlogicvectortounsignednaturalpostmpna, wCntReglength codepre  p... however, note that this command basically sets the value, which will be effectuated emnextem time this same command runs. Thus, it cannot run in the counter clock process  in the code below, I have it in the faster master clock process.p  pFinally, the code below does work goes through behavioral simulation in ISE WebPack  but, Id still like to know if there is a more straightforward way to solve this.p  pThanks in advance for any answers, Cheersp  pnbspp  pThe codep  precode  library IEEE   use IEEE.STDLOGIC1164.ALL    use IEEE.STDLOGICARITH.ALL    use IEEE.STDLOGICUNSIGNED.ALL   use IEEE.NUMERICSTD.ALL   ENTITY complementcounttesttbw IS END complementcounttesttbw  ARCHITECTURE testbencharch OF complementcounttesttbw IS     httpwww.ingenieurbueroeschemann.dedownloadsipicregsexamplevhdltesttimerregstb.vhd    convert stdlogic to stdlogicvector0 downto 0   function vectorizes stdlogic return stdlogicvector is   variable v stdlogicvector0 downto 0   begin       v0  s       return v   end      DECLARE REGISTERS      wires   SIGNAL wtCLK  stdlogic  0     counter register 16 bit   SIGNAL wCntReg  STDLOGICVECTOR15 DOWNTO 0  others gt Z     temporary natural copy of counter register    httpwww.velocityreviews.comforumst21700stdlogicvectortounsignedtypecasting.html   SIGNAL tmpna  natural      clock parameters   constant PERIODN  natural  20  can be real  20.0   constant PERIOD  time  PERIODN  1 ns   constant DUTYCYCLE  real  0.5   constant OFFSET  time  100 ns     freq divisor with initial values   constant fdiv  natural  16   SIGNAL fdivcnt  natural  1   SIGNAL wfdivCLK  stdlogic  0  BEGIN     initializations of connections     instances of components, and their wiring port maps...

I created a datatemplate that loads this usercontrol for each customtype item in the itemssource collection. At this point any Binding statements I make inside TeamUserControl can reference Team properties directly by path Binding PathTeamOwner and work. Is there a way to bind a reference to the ItemsSource item the usercontrol is representing For example, in the TeamUserControl creating a dependancy property of type Team and have it bound to the instance of the item from the ItemsSource.p  precode    ltItemsControl NameItemCtrl Grid.Row0 ItemsSourceBinding PathLeague.Teamsgt       ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt         ltDataTemplategt           ltmycontrolsTeamUserControl AttachedTeamBinding  TeamOwnerNameBinding PathTeamOwnergt         ltDataTemplategt        ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt     ltItemsControlgt codepre  pIn this example the window is representing a class League which has the property ObservableCollection Teams. And there is a class Team which has the propertyTeamOwner. The TeamUserControl has two dependancy properties AttachedTeam of type Team, and TeamOwnerName of type string. p  pI included the teamowner property reference to show that there is an instance of Team for each of these usercontrols. I am just not sure how to reference it.p

Negative 81474 pIm using .Net 4.5 preview... 4 is fine for the purposes of this question. Im doing threading work.p  pBased on my studies, I know that x86 CPUs have a strong memory model, which means writes wont be reordered. This makes releasing locks safe. This is not true for Itanium CPUs, which have a weak memory model.p  pI understand volatile, memory barriers, and execution reordering principles.p  pWhat I need ideally is to insert memory barriers at key points strongifstrong the CPU is Itanium, but not if its x86. Is it possible to do this dynamically, as in have runtime compiler directives that the JIT processesp  pIf not, I realise I will need to have separate builds for the two platforms. In that case, what is the most elegant way to do this without having 2 sets of C files, but rather simply changing the targetp
Negative 81474 pIm having a problem with my test application.  Im running a win form application which can post requests to a web service.  There is a timer which periodically adds items to the queue of requests.  I have a class called AutoManager which is used to pick items off the queue and send them off to the web service.p  pIn TryKickQueue it adds an IAutoProcessor onto the threadpool queue.  Once the IAutoProcessor is finished it calls back to the AutoManager to remove itself from the queue.p  pThis works fine and runs the first 10 requests no problem however for some reason I cant figure out the 10th thread never finishes and so it gets stuck.  Its weird because it is always the 10th.

If I change either the rules or the property name, I need to remember to change that codeKeyColumncode, too. So, basically, it is not refactoring save.p

Negative 81474 pI ran into an issue while Im making a 4 player chess game. I am unable to see if two ImageIcons are the same. I have four arrays for the red, blue, green, and yellow pieces and my idea was to see if what piece the player clicked on matched any of the pieces in their color array. However if I say like ifcolorIcon.equalsclickedIcon it returns false. I know that is because .equals refers to the reference and Im making new space in the memory. So is there any way I can compare two ImageIcons Thanks for reaadingp

Negative 81474 pIm using the MinGW32 and MinGW64 toolchains to do something somewhat complicated. Im wrapping a custom native C library DLL for windows with SWIGJava to then load it as a Java Applet jar on a browser using JNLP. This all seems to work fine and dandy for 32 bit browsers. Im able to compile my native shared library including the SWIG binding using MinGW32 on a linux box and itll load fine afterwards on IE 32 bit.p  pIt took me quite a while to get MinGW64 to play nice on the machine but I was finally able to compile the custom library into a 64 bit native windows library. It loads fine on a 64 bit browser but then crashes upon calling a certain function on it. As far as I can deduce the function ties into the winmm library. Is it possible that somehow Windows tries to load a 32 bit DLL, which then causes the crash p  pIm somewhat lost for details as the Java log just disappears and java.exe crashes with not much information not even in the event log. Ive made sure a 64 bit Java runtime is active and the JNLP  Java log seems to be an exact match with the 32 bit version up until it crashes except for the architecture name.p  pIs there a way to get more info on the crash somehow, or debug the whole thingp  pEdit Apparently it crashes in a thread somewhere. I wonder if its threading related. The native library is able to record some audio part of its functionality and able to play it back from a file locally. This seems to indicate that a lot of the C code is fine.p

Negative 81474 pIm migrating a very big Rails 2.3 application from ruby 1.8 to 1.9. Along the way, Ive had some database encoding issues that, it seemed, could only be resolved by moving from the old coderubymysqlcode gem to codemysql2code. p  pThis has worked fine for all codeActiveRecordBasecode ORM like queries codeusers  User.findall, conditions gt ...code, etc, but the application also relies heavily on querying the DB directly for some performance related issues. Its quite common to see stuff like thisp  precodeActiveRecordBase.connection.executeoptimizedsql.eachhash do row    do some stuff with row end codepre  pstrongORstrongp  precode for specific connections different servers, etc client  Mysql.realconnecthost, username, password, schema client.querytweakedsql.eachhash do row    do some stuff with row end codepre  pstrongORstrongp  precode for batch inserts client.autocommitfalse insertlist.each  insert client.queryinsert  client.commit codepre  pI should note that this querying is done mostly in designated class files written for that, so not in controllers, models and such  but mostly for stuff under codeapprootlibcode. I also cannot seem to find many equivalent features of stuff I used in the old gem. A good example is the codeautocommitcode like method to enable batch queries, like multiple INSERTs.p  pI would like to smooth the transition by using both gems  codemysql2code for all codeActiveRecordcode stuff, and coderubymysqlcode for direct client connection to the database. However, when I include both in my apps Gemfile, Rails seems to default to one or the other. Is there a way to configure the Gemfile to only include coderubymysqlcode but not automatically require it when the app loadsp  pHow can I make sure both are present, and only use coderequire mysqlcode in the files where I strictly want to use the old gem Is there any other approach I should be taking Converting the entire app in one stroke from is a pretty big risk, and I would like to enable my team some time to adapt and transition old code from Mysql to Mysql2. p  pthanks.p

Negative 81474 pI have a number of controls on an administrator user interface that give various pieces of data derived from the database, i.e. registered users, site visitors, etc, etc. and Id like to know if theres a way of automatically updating the data on the client side based on updating values in the database.p  pEssentially, it would be a live feed of the number of registered users, or number of site visitors.p  pI know its possible using JavaScript to poll a web service every little while that queries the database to pull out the relevant data, but I was wondering if theres a better way of doing it.p  pIve had a quick look into Ajax live data binding and jQuery jsView  templating, but from what I can tell, the Ajax live data binding isnt being developed any more and I cant quite tell from reading about jsView if itll do the trick or not.p

Negative 81474 pI have a set of data, over 1000 rows and 20 attributes  shown in columns . I am wanting use mean centering, which includes taking the mean away from each value to give a mean of 0. Do I remove the mean on an attribute by attribute basis, or do I remove the mean of all attributes from eachp  pFor example, if the mean of attribute A was 500, and the mean of attribute B was 1,000. For all values in A I could remove 500, which gives the A attribute a mean of 0. Then I could do the same for attribute B.p  pORp  pI could take 750 off all values for both attributes.p  pWhich is more statistically correctp  pMy question is due to this If I subtract different values from the different attributes, the attributes are then no longer comparable as different amount have been taken from each. If I subtract the same value from all, then some columns may be full of just negative figures  and so negating the effect of mean centering .p  pThanks,p

Negative 81474 pI have one items [id, name, color, size, etc]  table with more than 6000. And i think it can reach 10000 at most. In that table basically is information about, well, items. I also have 5 constant storehouses tables  and from 0 to 7 temporary storehouses tables. Those tables are like this id, itemid, quantity. I tried to normalize that database by combining those storehouses in one table id, itemid, quantity, storehouseid. That made searches extremely slow 610sec when searching for multiple items from all storehouses using selfjoins. Then I decided to combine items with that newly created database id, name, color, size, etc, storehouse1quantity, storehouse2quantity, etc. That made queries less than a 0.1s for any request. But now the database is very denormalized. As storehouses have no more than 2000 items and mostly less than 500. I can live with that if there is no better way. I dont know where to look at to make database more logic and easier to maintain. Any help is appreciated Thanks in advancep

Negative 81474 pIm using numpy.svd to compute singular value decompositions of badly conditioned matrices. For some special cases the svd wont converge and raise a Linalg.Error. Ive done some research and found that numpy uses the DGESDD routine from LAPACK. The standard implementation has a hardcoded iteration limit of 35 or something iterations. If I try to decompose the same matrix in Matlab, everything works fine, and I think theres two reasons for that  1. Matlab uses DGESVD instead of DGESDD which in general seems to be more robust. 2. Matlab uses an iteration limit of 75 in the routine. They changed it in the source and recompiled it.p  pNow the question is Is there a simple way to change the used backend in numpy from DGESDD to DGESVD without having to modify the numpy source p  pThanks in advance Mischap

Negative 81474 pI have a Rails app where I have a codeshowcode action with a form.  This codeshowcode action uses a view that checks codeif usertype  admincode and displays a partial accordingly.  For this codeshowcode view, only codeif usertype  admincode can access it.p  pOnce the form is submitted, it triggers another action in the same controller codestorecode.  The issue Im having is that when there is an error with the submission, codestorecode renders codeshowcode without reference to the user, so the partial doesnt appear since usertype wont equal admin since it cant find the user.  However, since access to show is protected, Im wondering if theres a way I can check the url.p  pExample the form is onp  precodehttpfoo.combars4users3 codepre  phowever, when it fails, the render url becomesp  precodehttpfoo.combars4usersstore codepre  pthe show.html.erb view has thisp  precodelt formfor[bar,user], url gt storebaruserspathparams[barid], html gt namegtusersform,multipart gt true,classgt standardForm do user gt  lt render partial gt usersadminoptions if user.usertype  admin gt codepre  pin the codestorecode action in the controllerp  precode if user.save   render action  gt show ,layout gt application  else codepre  pSo what Im wondering is if I can change the conditional in p  precodelt render partial gt usersadminoptions if user.usertype  admin gt  codepre  pto somehow also also check the url for codestorebaruserspathcode, or something like that  or perhaps the render in the codestorecode action is incorrect.p

Negative 81474 pI was building a page for displaying Instragram photos when I ran into an architectural problem that I dont know how to solve.p  pI have a collection of users, each of whom has an associated token that I can query on the Instagram API to get an uptodate list of photos taken by that user.p  pI want to have a page that simply lists a few photos from each user in my collection.

Users should take a photo on Instagram, reload the page, and see their photo appear right away.li liAs fast as possible.li liNot particularly AJAXbased if I can avoid it.li ol  pThe really stupid implementation I wrote last night sacrificed speed to ensure it was up to date.

Obviously, this is totally wrong. I am making multiple HTTP requests of Instagram inside my own requestresponse cycle. I could do something to parallelize the queries, but it would still be wrong for the simple fact that if the connection to Instagram hangs, the user will never get a response from my server.p  pMy question is, what is the right way to do this I can think of solutions that involve more moving parts for example, the server sends a response with a blank template, or maybe just a list of URLs to query, and the client uses AJAX to fill in the image URLs by querying Instagram directly. Is there a simpler solutionp

Negative 81474 pUsing JSF 1.2 with Facelets 1.x on top of IBM portal server 6.1 p  pWe are making extensive use of the templating, composition, decorate and include mechanisms that facelets provide which is absolutely fantastic and allows us to modularise our html extensively. p  pOne feature we do not like is if we make a mistake in our filenames or pathnames when referring to them in an include or a src attribute, the page does not render at all, just a completey blank screen with nothing written to any log and no exceptions thrown. This can hamper debugging quite a bit. p  pThe particular case that prompted this question was one where we promoted our app from our local windows machines to our unix staging test machine. One of our included fragments contained a lowercase s instead of an uppercase S in the name and it took the developer assigned to fix it quite a long time to track it down.p  pIs there any way we can get facelets to log or throw exception when it cannot find an html fragment p

Negative 81474 pI am currently looking into the problem of regular expressions which can end up running in exponential time when matched against a certain input, for example both codeacode and codeaacode potentially exhibit a hrefhttpwww.regularexpressions.infocatastrophic.htmlcatastrophic backtrackinga when matched against the string aaaaab  for every extra a in the matched string, the time needed to attempt to match the string doubles. This is only the case if the engine uses a backtrackingNFA approach of attempting to try all possible branches in the tree before failing, such as that used in PCRE.p  pMy question is, why isnt codeacode vulnerable Based on my understanding of backtracking, what should happen in the string aaaab is essentially what happens with codeaacode. If we construct the NFA using the standard Thomspson NFA construction, surely for each epsilon transition that occurs, the engine will have to keep taking them and backtracking in the same way it would for the case of two as For example omitting some steps and where  replaces epsilon p  paaaa matches, but cant match b, fail backtrackbr aaaa matches, b fail backtrackbr aaaa matches, b fail backtrackbr aaaa matches, b fail backtrackbr ...br aaaa matches, b fails backtrackp  ptrying all possible combinations of epsilons and a, surely leading to an exponential blowup of routesp  pIt would make sense to remove the epsilon transitions from the NFA, but I believe this has the effect of removing all nondeterminism from the codeacode pattern. This is definitely vulnerable though, so Im not entirely sure whats going onp  pThank you very much in advancep  pstrongEditstrong It has been pointed out by Qtax that epsilons cant still be present when the NFA is traversed with the traditional backtracking, otherwise codecode will attempt to match forever. So what NFA implementation could possibly lead to codeacode and codeaacode being exponential, and codeacode not being so This is the crux of the question really.p

Negative 81474 pI need to implement pagination that is consistent and efficient for a list of objects that have a onetomany relationship.  Items in the list are displayed in groups, and the number of group members varies among groups.  Some groups may not contain any members. The paging should be determined by the number of group members.p  pFor example, think about a family photo directory. Here are the rulesp  ol liEach family unit is grouped together as a set on the page.li liAny number of families can appear on the same page. li liThere should be approximately 10 photos per page.li liThe whole family must appear on the same page.  If the last family on the page will overflow the 10 picture limit, either keep that family on this page OR display them on the next page, and do this consistently.li liIf there are no photos of the family members, the family grouping will appear without any pictures.  Since there are no pictures, this group will not count towards the 10 picture limit.li liIt is possible to have a family with more than 10 photos, and this case should be handled.li ol  pPlease share any tips for developing this algorithm.  I would greatly appreciate any platformspecific hints as well. The application uses Hibernate 3.3.2 and Spring 2.5.6.  The database is Oracle 10g.p

Could someone tell me which is truep  pIn a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesperformance.htmlmyths relnofollowPerformance Mythsa section isp  blockquote   pOn devices without a JIT, caching field accesses is about strong20strong faster than repeatedly accesssing the field. With a JIT, field access costs about the same as local access.p blockquote  pIn a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesperformance.htmlinternalgetset relnofollowAvoid Internal GettersSettersa section isp  blockquote   pWithout a JIT, direct field access is about strong3xstrong faster than invoking a trivial getter. With the JIT where direct field access is as cheap as accessing a local, direct field access is about strong7xstrong faster than invoking a trivial getter.p blockquote  pIts clear that without JIT local access is faster. Its also clear that accessing field is faster while accessing directly than with getter.   p  pBut why in the first case performance is strong20strong better and in the second case performance is strong133strong better for the same reason, that is JIT optimization for calling object fieldp

Negative 81474 pI have a RadTreeView which that can eb referenced by the variable  emTVemp  pI did not know if i could just do jQuery to do TV.attrOnClientNodeExpanded,newvalue because there might be a server side link that i may be unaware of.p  pWhen I defined my RadTreeView in the markup, it has 2 attributes  OnClientNodeExpanded and OnClientNodeClicked which are set to some javascript functions.p  pMy question is as followsp  pIs there a way to change where both OnClientNodeExpanded and OnClientNodeClicked point by some reference like  TV.setClientNodeExpandedNEWFUNCTIONp  pI want to depending on what is clicked have the RadTreeView populate different material.p  pEdit to help clarify my goal emThe asp.net control has those attributes.  Which means that the functions, are actually loadNode and clickedNode. What i was wanting to do was to change the reference of those attributes listed above to point to a different function. I wasnt sure i wanted to have an intermediate judging function to determine what functions were to be called, but instead a way to override the current declaration as to what fires when the RadTreeView Event Occurs. Does that clarifyemp

Negative 81474 pThe problem Im trying to solve seems very simple to me My application has a sitewide menu from which the user can navigate to various areas. The menu items are simply links to ActionResult methods. Im using a custom AuthorizeAttribute on the actions to enforce the users authorization roles. That works fine, in that it prevents the user from executing the action if they dont have the appropriate roles. What I want to do, though, is not even show the menu option to navigate to that action if they arent authorized to perform it.p  pSo, at the simplest level, I want to be able to do something like thisp  precodevar isAuthorized  IsAuthorizedControllerName, ActionName, currentUser codepre  pThe IsAuthorized method would then look at any AuthorizeAttributes on the action, and evaluate whether the given user would be able to execute it. p  pDoes such an approach exist Assume that we dont have an instance of the controller at the point that were making this evaluation. p

Negative 81474 pI have a tab control and a number of tab items that are populated programatically and contain a custom control. At the minute each custom control is instantiated and codeinitializeComponentcode is called on every user control when the tab control is created. p  pI suspect this is a bad way of doing it as some of the user controls can contain huge amounts of data, initialise database connections etc. I want to make this as efficient as possible. What I want to do is minimise the amount of work done by each user control until the tab it is located on is actually selected and visible to the user. p  pAfter digging around I found a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles217022DelayingElementInitializationforCollapsedCont relnofollowthisa detailing delayed initialisation for collapsed controls. I have managed to get this working for my tabs, but then after some more digging I managed to find the codeLoadedcode and codeUnloadedcode events. Would I be able to achieve delayed initization by simply removing codeinitializeComponentcode from the user controls constructor and adding it to the codeLoadedcode event handlerp  pAlso ideally what I want to be able to do is un initialize the user control when the codeunloadedcode event fires, until the next time the codeloadedcode event fires. Is there a way to reverse the xaml loading that occurs during initializeComponentp  pI realise this may not be a trivial answer but I would appreciate any guidancehelp. p  pPlease let me know if you require anymore information. p

But how do I have to define the router now, to get URLpaths with the nested categories like thisp  precodecategoryname1                                         showing category view categoryname1articlename1                            showing article view categoryname2articlename2                            showing article view categoryname2subcategoryname1                        showing category view categoryname2subcategoryname2articlename4           showing article view ncategoryname.....nsubcategoryname               showing category view ncategoryname.....nsubcategorynamenarticlename         article view codepre  pI tried to make all routes fix in the routes.php, but that is not very comfortable and I think there should be a dynamic solution.p  pI also tried to automatically generate all routes out of category and articlealias and save them in a separate routes database table  it worked, but I dont think its really necessary to define hunderets of single routesp  pI also tried just to define all the categories fix in router, likep  precodeRouterconnect   anycategoryname,   arraycontroller gt categories, action gt view, 1  codepre  pand then for the articlesp  precodeRouterconnect   anycategorynameslug,   arraycontroller gt articles, action gt view,   arraypass gt arrayslug  codepre  pBut with this method, all articles are available in all categories, which isnt a good solution. And I thought about usingp  precodeRouterconnect   slug, ... codepre  pbut I dont know how to go on, because there are two different controllers and two different views possible also I dont know if Pagination will still work in this case and what will happen, if I also want to use more controllersactions in the installation.p  pI think it shouldnt be so difficult to get nested urls with two controllers categories and articles in Cake Thanks for any helpful advisep

Negative 81474 pWeve just experienced an issue where a newly attached Dev instance picked up schema changes that had been made to the previous Dev database but were not present in the Live DB replica before it was renamed and attached as Dev.p  pThe Dev DB starts as a log shipping standby that is fully restored, detached, files are renamed and then reattached as the new Dev DB. Note that the previous Dev database is not being deleted just detached. Also note that the old and new Dev DBs are both forks of the same original database.p  pNow this is a DevTest environment so its not particularly problematic but it makes me worry that well create something against a silently changed Dev that will break Live when its applied.p  pSo my working theory is that this relates to the unique identifiers used by the SQL Server internals and possibly the timing of the changes to Dev.p  pCan anyone confirm this or shed any light on the issuep  pEDIT Further detail The schema changes involved the addition of new nullable columns at the end of a few tables. So they were admittedly minor and importantly did not involve any actual data. Also, the log shipping copy was in Standby until it was reattached so read only and Ive reviewed the query logs to verify that no DDL changes were run. p  pThat said, unfortunately I cannot replicate the issue. It does not happen with a small DB created just to test it and I deleted the Dev DB and recreated it from a full backup to resolve the issue so I cannot repeat the exact process.p  pMy goal in asking the question is to ascertain whether weve experienced an exceptional fluke or our process is fundamentally unsound. Im leaning toward exceptional fluke at the moment.p

Negative 81474 pWe are rendering an ASP.Net web form with a runatserver tag in a bootstrap modal. We use the built in bootstrap capability to use the jQuery load function perform a get request and then insert the response into the bootstrap modal markup.p  pThe asp.net web form returns a HTTP Status Code of 204 no content on postback this means we can submit the form, the ASP.Net server side click event fires appropriately and the browser does not attempt to render the response. We then close the bootstrap modal with some javascript. p  pThis works beautifully on windows in IE10, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. On the iPad however in Safari responds to the 204 status code by rendering the original page markup displayed as text. I have also tried 302 Not Modified, which didnt resolve the problem either and is not really semantically correct.p  pI have searched for similar problems and only found a reference to an old webkit bug from 2008 where the code was described as rendering a blank page when receiving a 204.p  pstrongWork Aroundstrongp  pI have also tried setting SuppressContent property of the Response object to truep  precode        if Page.IsPostBack                       Do page rendering stuff                  else                      Response.StatusCode  intHttpStatusCode.NoContent             Response.SuppressContent  true          codepre  pThis does help in that Safari no longer renders the original page markup as text, the bootstrap modal is closed via the javascript call but safari displays the URL for the page that was loaded in the modal in the address bar and behaves like its loading a page but never does.

Negative 81474 pi want to use automatic numeration of Figures by word. When i insert a caption, I can choose what kind of caption this is, and since i have a different language than english, i made a new Type Figure. The problem is with referencing When i insert a cross reference onto that figure, it inserts it as Figure and makes it bold, since i embolden the Figure part of the caption, to make it more visible. p  pHow can i change this in the text to be abbreviated with fig. Its annoying that the capitalisation is wrong and that the whole word Figure is inserted, instead of just the abbreviation. How can i accomplish thatp

All examples that I have seen lists all files using a regex, but as we have tests for several files in different folders with wildly different names and where some folders mostly contain code that does not have any unit tests I am not sure how to create a regex that is able to match the different files we have.p  pIs there a way to list several files without using a regex, and if it is there an easy way to create a regex that matches only the files we have unit tests forp

Negative 81474 pOn a mac OS X I run ndk which generates some .so libraries which in theory should be reusable on windows. However, when I eclipse recompile my Android project on windows I get different apk size and it runs differently than when the whole eclipse build is done on Mac.  Only building on the mac works. Not taking the .so files from the mac ndk build, and reusing them in the windows build. Its either that or something different about how macs and windows builds apk files that I dont understand. The problem with the windows generated apk is that it has memory over consumption not seen on the apk generated solely on osx.p  pSo to clarify this ON MAC OS X worksp  p1 run ndk on osX generate .so files 2 OS X eclipse compile android app and deploy on device. 3 OS X eclipse run apk on device.p  pthe generated apk of course runs on all devices.p  pThis ON WINDOWS does NOT work 1 on windows use .so generated on osx ndk build. 2 windows eclipse compile android app using the .so files generated by ndk on OS X. 3 eclipse run apk on device.

Negative 81474 pWhy would codejava.util.zip.ZipErrorcode be thrown, and is it okay to catch itp  pThe javadoc says that it means that an unrecoverable error has occurred  but what would such an error be I have heard that it can occur from bad zip files.p  pEDITp  pLooking at the java.util.zip sources shows that it is thrown when an attempt is made to access an element in the file that does not exist, but the codejava.util.zip.ZipFilecode classs internal count indicates that the element should exist. This can occur if another thread tried to close the file after the codeensureOpencode method checked for this, or if something went wrong in the native methods called by codejava.util.zip.ZipFilecode. This looks like it could occur if the file was changed while the Java application had it open. I dont really understand the entirity of the codebase involved though it is big.p

Negative 81474 pI am working with the core data model in Xcode 5 and I am trying to code an app for school that helps me determine my grades. I need the app to show a table view of each class and then when you select one, it takes you to the next page and from there you can add sections ex. test, quiz, hw, etc. and be able to add the percent and grade for each.p  pNow my question is, should I be using 2 entities or just 1 I was thinking two class and section and then just use multiple sections per class. But would anyone advise doing this If so, how should I go about making the class entity the parent or the section entity or maybe there is a way to do it with just one entity and work with multiple sections within it.. Any advice or answers would be appreciated. p

Negative 81474 pIve been trying to write code with CUDA that fills an array, writes the contents of the array to disk, refills the array with different values after the first write to disk is complete, etc. Im using this strategy to prevent global memory space from limiting my final file size.

I assume that since theres only the default stream, the kernel executes, the memory is copied synchronously, and finally hostOut is written to file. This is the part Im not quite sure about. Will the kernel from for loop iteration n1 begin to execute while fwrite from for loop iteration n is still working I assume not, but when I insert the linep  precodeprintfd , n codepre  pjust after fwrite and before the closing bracket of the for loop, nothing happens during the 3 minute execution of the program until the last second or so when the numbers 0 through 99 are all printed at once.

The options for cause of death are asphyxiation, blunt force, other, shooting, stabbing, unknown. No other causes are allowed. If a cause of death is specied that is not one of these, then the function should throw an error with the stop function.

Negative 81474 pIm trying to fit my my noise data to an exponential. It seems that the least squares fit is consistently giving a slower decay time than the data actually suggests. Ive tried smoothing the data via convolution with a Gaussian, and that gives a faster decay time than it should Here is a picture of some data I generated that exemplifies my pointp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comWYygIga.jpg altgraphp  pThe red curve is just an exponential, which I added some gaussian noise to to make the blue curve. The teal curve is the blue curved smoothed with a gaussian kernel. The green is the least squares fit to the teal curve, and the purple is the least squares fit to the blue curve what I call the actual data. Does anyone know the best way to fit to an exponential to minimize this effect i.e., what will give the curve which is most similar to the red curve Any help or really any ideas at all related to this would be greatly appreciatedp
Negative 81474 pFor a class I have to replicate a rather intricate bug from an open source project. The project has tens of thousands of lines of code, and I have never really tested a GUI before. I am having a difficult time finding where all of the constructors and methods are called throughout the project.  p  pIm using the Eclipse IDE. The bug is replicated through a series of interactions with different parts of the GUI. I have looked online through different open source GUI projects, however it seems that most of these projects just generate scripts to repeat the clicks that I make.p  pWhat is the simplest way to find all of the method call sites to replicate the bug using JUNIT Is there a simple way I can follow method calls in the Eclipse debugger to see what is called when a button is clickedp  pIs there an open source GUI testing project that will follow my clicks and create a resulting JUNIT test that can be runp  pThanks.p

Negative 81474 pWe have a lot of very small blocks that we want to include with an ESI in an Symfony2 application. To be concrete, it is about rating stars that get displayed in a list of products  and about an user avatar and rank which gets displayed in a list of comments. So we talk about very small pieces of information for list items. A part of the question is also that those small blocks do not need an URL, but to render them as ESI i need to give them an URL. Is it an design flaw to do this, because for me, making those block public available with an URL feels like an design flaw.p

Negative 81474 pIve got a very odd behavior with one of my tests. It runs successfully in Chrome, but always fails in Firefox.br It tests a directive and error occurs in codebeforeEachcode block. p  precodeTypeError menu is null pathtofile.js6  This points to a block of comments process.onglobal.onerrordirnodemodulesmochamocha.js5708 This function throws every unhandled error codepre  pThe directive itself work properly in Firefox. codebeforeEachcode compiles it and sets some properties on the scope. Strange as it may seem, all tests of the codedescribecode block report they have passed, but WebStorm reports that only 24 out of 28 codeitcodes are done.p  pAny ideas what the hack is going onp

Negative 81474 pI have a Google Map and a server sends a list of objects that have a position with a small radius 100m max. I need to quickly be able to know if a position is colliding with something in the list and draw on the map everything.p  pIm thinking I should use a Quadtree very useful in 2D collisions for games but my issue is Im not limited to a screen but to the earth  Sure, if I have 100 objects its not a problem but at any time the server can send me new objects that I need to add to the list and so my Quadtree could drastically change or become unbalanced. What should I do  Should I still use a Quadtree and modify the entire tree if a new element is added outside of the current boundaries  Should I set the boundaries to the max latitude longitude but could have issue with double precision  Or does someone knows a better data structure for that type of problem p  prXpp

Negative 81474 pI have inline attachmentsimagesetc. in a received email. I want to save them to disk. I could locate them as codeInlineShapecodes in the codeWord.Documentcode object.

I could save them from the codeOutlook.Attachmentcode objects in one pass, and then replace them by text finding codeInlineShapecode objects in a second pass.

Negative 81474 pIm trying to learn the MFC to code for Windows and Ive come across things like the IDFILEEDIT macros that are defined as being unicode values I think.

Im trying to get custom menus and custom menu buttons to stem from the MFC. Like I want under file new, open existing doc and stuff like that. Ive got VS2013 pro and all the headers I could ever want. Second question is where do I start with the MFC. Should I start by practicing making windows then pulldowns and then... something else I know where the documentation is at and I understand where the class references are.

Negative 81474 pWhat is the best way to determine relevancy and the cutoff of results to show p  pSo the system Im working on right now involves searching the inventory and returning the results. Each result must be reviewed by an employee to determine whether it is a true match. Obviously, we want to minimize the number of false results we return. p  pIve been tweaking boosts and stuff to get it to score better, but we still have a few problems with determining relevancy. p  pAn absolute threshold doesnt work because search scores are only meaningful relative to the results in a given query. So a score of 200 on one query may not be as relevant as a score of .2 on another. p  pThe other method Ive seen is a score normalized with respect to the top score of a query. Then we can return all results at are within x of that score. However, if there are no good results, then the top result is very poor, and all the results we return will be poor. p  pHow can I determine which documents are relevant and which are notp

Negative 81474 pI have a dumb question.  Suppose an application is moved to the active state from the stopped state this is related to having an app startup after BOOTCOMPLETED and moving the app out of the stopped state.  But then the device is shutdown and there is a battery pull.  When the device is restarted will the apps that were in the active state still be in that state  My guess is they will not but I want to confirm this i.e. states are not saved.  p  pWould the situation be any different if there were a battery pull without a shutdown  agreed, not a good situation.p  pThe use case I am looking at is if a battery pull is required to move the system from a lockup condition  not specifically the Android device, but it may be on the same battery feed.p  pI looked through the ACTIONBATTERY... intents but did not get any insight with regards to this question.  Thanks in advance.p

Devices subscribe to push notifications and receive them as expected. When apsenvironment  production, it works on everything except iOS 8 devices.p  piOS 8 devices never receive the prompt to allow push notifications, and are never subscribed through Appcelerator Cloud Services.p  pBased on this I assume that my certificates are all ok, since devices using iOS 7 dont have the problem. I want to know if I can fix this without updating the app.  Especially since it seems that building with XCode 6 means abandoning iOS 6 users I know there are some out there.p  pUpdate  I also built this adhoc and it works fine  Its only the appstore version that is not working in iOS 8.p

Negative 81474 pI use Windows under VMWare Fusion to do my Windows based dev work. I keep my code on the OS X partition and share the folder so Windows sees it as a drive. I can then use Git in my shell like I do with everything else.p  pHowever, whenever I change a file under Windows, the mode changes from 100644 to 100755 chmod x essentially, so Windows appears to be doing something which causes Git to think the executable bit has been set.p  pHow can I stop it .gitconfig under Windows isnt relevant, Windows doesnt even have Git installed, and under OS X it doesnt seem likely either, but...p  p[EDIT]p  pAfter some thought, Ive turned core.filemode to off in the local .gitconfig for the working dir in question, thus solving the problem in one way. However, its not a great solution, as Id like to be able to change file permissionsexec in OS X, but not have Windows editing change things. Im beginning to think that might just not be possible as the setting can only ever be at working dir level.p
Negative 81474 pWe started our TS project using the external modules with coderequire Foo  .Foocode and while the organization of it is very useful, it requires then that you use requirejsAMD moddules or similar. While this isnt a problem I have noticed in doing perf analysis that this ends up with our page making a large number of requests for JS files. We have a reasonably complex app with a lot of smaller js files and that ends up with us making about 160 requests for various files. This obviously has a large overhead and mobile clients dont deal well with lots of requests. I am looking in to what it would take to move away from this pattern and use TypeScripts out parameter to generate one file. I was curious if anyone had made a similar jump and had any advice for making this type of change.p

Deploy solution packages SharePoint Server 2013emstrongp  pstrongA.    Adding a solution packagestrong Before you can deploy a solution package, you must add it to the solution database of a SharePoint Server farm.  Important  You must be a member of the Administrators group on any computer on which you run Windows PowerShell.  To import a solution package by using Windows PowerShell  1.  On the Start menu, click All Programs. 2.  Click Microsoft SharePoint 2013 Products. 3.  Click SharePoint 2013 Management Shell as an administrator. 4.  At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type the following command 5.  AddSPSolution LiteralPath p  precodeEx addspsolution literalpath DDebugF21WebPart.wsp codepre  pThe solution is added to the farms solution store. To use the solution, follow the procedure in the next section in this article.  Quick Overview Heres a quick overview of what weve learned with a few more tidbit commands youll probably need along the way    Add Solution AddSPSolution c.wsp    DeployInstall Solution InstallSPSolution Identity .wsp WebApplication http GACDeployment    Update Solution UpdateSPSolution Identity .wsp LiteralPath c.wsp GACDeployment    Uninstall Solution UninstallSPSolution Identity .wsp WebApplication http    Remove Solution RemoveSPSolution Identity .wspp  pstrongB.    Deploying a solution packagestrong You can deploy imported solutions by using the Central Administration Web site or by using Windows PowerShell. After a solution has been added to the solution store by using the Windows PowerShell AddSPSolution cmdlet, it must be deployed to a site before it can be accessed.   Note  You cannot add a solution to the solution store by using the Solution Management page in Central Administration.  The following procedures show how to deploy an imported solution to a site in the farm by using either the Central Administration Web site or Windows PowerShell. To deploy a solution by using Central Administration  1.  On the Central Administration Home page, click System Settings. 2.  In the Farm Management section, click Manage farm solutions. 3.  On the Solution Management page, click the solution that you want to deploy.  4.  On the Solution Properties page, click Deploy Solution.  5.  On the Deploy Solution page, in the Deploy When section, select one of the following  o   Now  o   At a specified time. If you select this option, specify a time by using the date and time boxes. We recommend that you select a time when the load on the destination servers is low. 6.  In the Deploy To section, in the A specific web application list, click either All web applications or select a specific Web application. 7.  Click OK. To deploy a solution package to a single Web application by using Windows PowerShell  1.  On the Start menu, click All Programs. 2.  Click Microsoft SharePoint 2013 Products. 3.  Click SharePoint 2013 Management Shell. 4.  At the Windows PowerShell command prompt as an administrator , type the following command 5.  InstallSPSolution Identity  WebApplication  Where o    is the name of the solution. o    is the URL of the Web application to which you want to deploy the imported solution. Ex addspsolution literalpath DDebugF21WebPart.wsp WebApplication httppwap  pBy default, the solution is immediately deployed. You can also schedule the deployment by using the time parameter.  To deploy a solution package to all Web applications by using Windows PowerShell  1.  On the Start menu, click All Programs. 2.  Click Microsoft SharePoint 2013 Products. 3.  Click SharePoint 2013 Management Shell. 4.  At the Windows PowerShell command prompt as an administrator, type the following command 5.  InstallSPSolution Identity  AllWebApplications time  GACDeployment CASPolicies Where o   GACDeployment is the parameter that enables SharePoint Server 2013 to deploy the assemblies in the global assembly cache. o   CASPolicies enables the creation of a custom code access security CAS policy file and the activation of it in the Web.config file of the targeted site collection.  The solution is immediately deployed by default. You can also schedule the deployment by using the time parameter.p  pstrongC. Verify the deployed Global Assemblestrong  1.  On the Start screen, press CTRL  TAB to open the Apps list and then press V. The list will include all installed Visual Studio command prompts. To open the Start screen, press the Windows logo key  on your keyboard.  2.  Choose the Developer Command Prompt or the command prompt you want to use. 3.  Type the following command.

Deploy and configure a Web Partstrongp  pTo manually deploy and configure a Web Part  1.  Verify that you have the following administrative credentials o   You must be a member of the local Administrators group on the server hostingSharePoint products. 2.  Copy the .dll assembly in the projects Bin directory to the Bin directory in your Web application root directory. For example CinetpubwwwrootwssVirtualDirectories80bin. 3.  Locate the Web.config file in your application root directory and open it for editing. 4.  Add the following safecontrol entry for your custom assembly to the Web.config file  5.  , Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull Namespace TypeName SafeTrue AllowRemoteDesignerTruep  pEx p  pPlease use the PublicKeyToken you remembered in gacutil window Where  1.  is the name of the Web Part that is being deployed.  2.  is the namespace that is associated with your Web Part.p  pstrong3. Add a Component to the Web Part Gallerystrongp  pEvery Web Part should have a .webpart file, which is an XML file that describes the Web Part. The .webpart file also causes your Web Part to appear in the Web Part gallery. The following procedure is the easiest way to create a .webpart file after you deploy your Web Part and register it in the Safe Control list. To add a component to the Web Part gallery  1.  Verify that you have the following administrative credentials o   You must be a member of the Farm Administrators group. 2.  To create a .webpart file, navigate to httplayoutsnewdwp.aspx, where  is the name of the server on which your SharePoint site is deployed. Ex.httppwalayoutsnewdwp.aspx 3.  Select the check box next to .. 4.  Click Populate Gallery to add the YourWebPartName Web Part to the Team Site gallery. 5.  In the Web Part gallery, select Edit to edit the Web Part, and then click Import.  You are prompted to specify a location for the .webpart file. You can also export ASP.NET Web Parts and import them to SharePoint sites.p

Negative 81474 ol lipwhilerowmysqlifetcharrayresult  echo row[sth] .....p  ol start2 lirow  mysqlifetcharrayresult whilerow  echo row[sth] .....li olli ol  pWhen I change first while loop to second, I get an infinite loop. Is there a way I can do codefetcharraycode before the while loop and not get an infinite loopp  pThe reason Im trying this is...p  pSo I have codeselect multiple nameoptions[]code delivered through codePOSTcode.br Then I am using codeforeachPOST[options] as optioncode to SELECT indexes whose field value matches codeoptioncode. After that, if I do a while loop as in code1.code from the above, I only get the elements of the last codeoptions[]code.br So I want to append the results of codemysqlifetcharraycode to an array coderowcode and then do a while loop as in code2.code But I get an infinite loop like said.p  pI know my explanation is a bit confusing.... If it isnt clear up to this point, read more below. I am explaining in more details with more codes provided.p  precode ifissetPOST[options]      foreachPOST[options] as option              query  SELECT  FROM users WHERE stdYr  option             result  mysqliquerydbconx, query or dieError in .query.ltbrgt.mysqlierrordbconx                whilerowmysqlifetcharrayresult  codepre  pWith this code, when an array options[option1, option2, option3] is passed, for example, the result only outputs the elements of options[option3]. Query output of option1 and option2 is overwritten in foreach loop.br So I came up with an attempt to declare codefetcharraycode inside foreach loop and append in to result like thisp  precode ifissetPOST[options]      foreachPOST[options] as option              query  SELECT  FROM users WHERE stdYr  option             result  mysqliquerydbconx, query or dieError in .query.ltbrgt.mysqlierrordbconx             row.mysqlifetcharrayresult                whilerow  codepre  pstrongBUTstrong this results in infinite loop.....p  pCan someone help Let me know if this doesnt make sense...

Negative 81474 pSo Im messing around with Koa.js and generators, just threw together a simple site for demo purposes. Im using sqlite with a hrefhttpsgithub.commapboxnodesqlite3 relnofollowcodenodesqlite3codea and Q for promises. Heres my db codep  precodemodule.exports.getLogs  function     var deferred  Q.defer     var results  []     db.serializefunction         db.eachSELECT ipAddress, action, details, timestamp FROM logs, functionerr, row              results.push                 ipAddress row.ipAddress,                 action row.action,                 details row.action,                 timestamp new Daterow.timestamp                      , function             deferred.resolveresults                    return deferred.promise  codepre  pSo basically Im just Q.defer to promisify the call to the database. Then, in my koa route, I have thisp  precodeapp.getlogs, function      var logs  yield db.getLogs     yield this.renderlogs, logs logs  codepre  pThe issue Im having is that the request is just hanging, the browser never gets a response. Whats really strange is that if I put a console.log statement after the codeyield db.getLogscode I see the results from the db just fine. The view is there, everything seems like it should work, but it simply doesnt. Any help would me much appreciatedp

Negative 81474 pWhile trying to localize a SpriteKit game i suddenly started getting the error  p  pCould not find a storyboard named Main in bundle NSBundlep  pI wasnt use a storyboard, and i think i actually deleted the file when i first started developing the game.

Negative 81474 pI am unsure if I have made a fundamental issue in my implementation or there is a bug in the Windows API with regards to formatting system error messages.p  pI have a Windows API wrapper method for the codeFormatMessagecode function.

Negative 81474 pPlease go easy on me if this is a simple question its my first time asking one, I am still a beginner with libGDX and working on my first game. p  pstrongBackgroundstrong I need to keep a list of Gem objects for a game I am working on in a list. Currently I am using an ArrayList, however I am using multiple helper methods. Unfortunately, because I am only using a generic ArrayList all of these helper methods have to be in my main game class.p  pstrongMy Questionstrong In an effort to keep my code as clean as possible, is there a way to override the entire ArrayList class just for my Gem object, so that I can add all of my helper methods, and still be able to use the Java defined ArrayListlt for other objects Or do I have to create a type of pseudo ArrayList class that implements all the methods associated with an ArrayList This just seems very tedious.p

Negative 81474 pI have an Access 2007 database that requires a query be run every week to gather every record that was worked on the prior week.  The current setup isp  ul liI have a query where the date ranges WHERE criteria is Between [Forms][frmMenu][txtfromdate] And [Forms][frmMenu][txttodate]1li lifromdate and todate text boxes in frmMenu are unbound text boxes.  fromdate has an AfterUpdate event that fills in todate with the date chosen in fromdate plus 6 days.li lifrmMenu has a button for running the query after fromdate and todate are filled in.li ul  pThe issue is, when I run the query for a weeks worth of records, I get entries outside the selected date range.  For example, if I have 312015 in the fromdate text box and 372015 in the todate text box, Ill receive the results from 31 to 37, but Im also getting results from 310, 311, and 312.p  pAt first, I thought it might be reading 312015 as 31x2015, but that doesnt explain why Im ONLY getting extra results from 310 through 312 and not 313 through 319 as well.p  pDoes anyone know what might be causing this  To work around this problem, Ive just been running a query that gathers EVERYTHING and then filtering out whats need in Excel before sending it over.

If parent is dead, then process is adopted by init and it does the waiting.p  pI am looking at such process now. I attached to init with strace.

But figure like tower can move left for 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 fields if there are not pieces on the left.. and this is problem that I must to create always new instance and I do not know how, because I must to create unique instance, change it a bit, and add to list.. always unique, but in different cases.p  pAlso I have tried your solution Joel, but the problem is that I need to do some changes to original chessfield 4 rows always, but different changes for different figures.

Negative 81474 pSo, Im working on using Jooq to create a caching layer over Postgres. Ive been using the MockConnectionMockDataProvider objects to intercept every query, and this is working, but Im having a few issues.p  pFirst, how do I determine between reads and writes That is, how do I tell whether a query is an insertupdateetc or a select, given only the MockExecuteContext thats passed into the execute method in MockDataProviderp  pAnd Im a bit confused on how I can do invalidations. The basic scheme Im implementing right now is that whenever a write query is made to a table, I invalidate all cached queries that involve that table. This goes back to my first question, on telling different types of queries from each other, but also brings up another issue how would I identify the tables used in a query given only the sql string and the bindings both are attributes of MockExecuteContext p  pAlso, is this a correct approach at caching My first thought was to override the fetch method, but that method is final, and Id rather not change something already embedded in Jooq itself. This is the only other way I could think of to intercept all requests made so I could create a separate, persistent caching layer. p  pI have seen this a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicjooquserxSjrvnmcDHw relnofollowhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicjooquserxSjrvnmcDHwa question, but Im still not clear on how Lukas recommended to identify tables from the object.

Negative 81474 pI am using SoapUI Pro 4.5.2 to read data from spreadsheets, put them into Soap requests to my web service, and get responses back to write to a spreadsheet.  Its working.p  pI have two fields in the input data pertinent to my question p  pMiddle name is defined as a string of 4 characters, and as minOccurs  1 and maxOccurs  1.  p  pPostal extension code the 4digit number that is optional after the normal 5digit code is defined as a string of 4 digits.  This field is optional, so it is marked as minOccurs0 and maxOccurs1.p  pWhen I use the SoapUI UI interface to send a request, this works fine if theres no value for middle name, SoapUI generates an empty tag and sends it I guess because of the minOccurs1.  If theres no value for PostalCode, it does not send any tag at all I guess because of minOccurs0.p  pWhen SoapUI reads data from an Excel spreadsheet, however, the response to the same data is an error indicating that the extended postal code value of  is not legal, because it must be 4 digits.  It appears that SoapUI generates an empty tag for the extended postal code when reading data from the spreadsheet, and sends it.p  pI found the Remove Empty Content option for SoapUI requests, default to false. I set it to true, and now get an error back from validation indicating that middle name is required but not found.  Im guessing that the remove empty content removed all the empty content reasonable enough, and middle name has to be there, even if empty, because of the minOccurs1.p  pDo I have any way out of this tailchasing problem  I suppose Im looking for something like a conditional for the output of the postal extension code, so I can eliminate it if its empty, even if reading values from the spreadsheet.p  pI am also curious if there are XSD fixes, but I greatly prefer a fix that doesnt involve changing the XSD  that becomes a political matter.p  pEDIT FOR DETAILp  pTo put input into the request I have used the SoapUI UI to choose properties from the input spreadsheet for each of the input fields when thats done, one ends up with values in the request fields likep  pSpreadsheetInputFrstNmp  pWhere SpreadsheetInput is the name of the datasource step reading the spreadsheet, and FrstNm is one of the properties.  I do this with the Get Data option off the popup menu you get by rightclicking the request input field, but there may be other ways.p

I use this for the following reasonsp  ol liThe image is part of the content, so no background image can be used.li liGoogle does not index the srcsetattribute, but it does index the srcattribute, which is why I use both. So this is mainly an SEO consideration.li liAs far as I have tested this, I havent found the browser sending double HTTPrequests.

Negative 81474 pI have been doing some research on data mining algorithms and now I would like to do some tests to verify my conception. The purpose of the experiment is to gather some data in slave nodes, process it and then send the data to a central node which would merge data from all nodes. The central node would process data again and send results to the slave nodes different for each node. I have already implemented the algorithms which will be used for processing and now I am looking for a software DB, framework etc which suits my needs.p  pI would be grateful for any help.p
