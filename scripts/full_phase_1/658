Positive 658 pI have an angular application with a asp.net backend. The site is hosted on site.somedomain.com and the api at api.somedomain.com. We want to post some javascript object to the server and an X amount of files. p  pNothing tricky there.. But theres one anoying businessrequirement... It has to work in IE9 too. p  pWe are unable to post the files to our web api using IE9. IE9 doesnt have the file api yet. And we were using the file api to read the image as data url, and then we send that to our backend. So we need to find an alternative method to either extract the base64 formated dataurl from a fileupload emorem we need to find another way to post these images to our api.p  pIve tried to JSON.stringify the object we want to post into a hiddend field and then post the entire form including the selected files to api.domain.com using a hidden iframe. This solution pretty much worked, but its nasty. I also was unable to detect wether or not the post was succesfull or not because the contents of the iframe are inaccesable due to the cross domain origin policyp  pDOMException Failed to read the contentDocument property from HTMLIFrameElement Blocked a frame with origin a hrefhttpsite.somedomain.com relnofollowhttpsite.somedomain.coma from accessing a crossorigin frame.  at Error native  at HTMLIFrameElement.a.onload a hrefhttpcdn.somedomain.comapp.jsxxxxx relnofollowhttpcdn.somedomain.comapp.jsxxxxxap  pI made the server send the following headers AccessControlAllowOrigin  AccessControlAllowMethods GET, POSTp  pI have not found a simple javascript that extracts the data urls from input[typefile] yet.p  pSo my question is  a. How would you attack this problem b. Is there a simple, free javascript library thats able to extract a dataurl from a fileinputp

Positive 658 pI am trying to solve a riddle here. Imagine the following. The user uploads one image, which a minute later he wants to replace. Thus he clicks on the image and selects the upload button again, chooses another image and uploads it. In the editor this image is shown, but when he saves the change, the old image is shown again.p  pMy guess is, that this is due to the fact that only the srcattribute gets updated, but not the datackesavedsrcattribute. The question now is How do I change that p  pI should also mention, that since I have a blurhandler, that is asking the user if he wants to discard the change. This fires whenever an dialog opens, which is why I am refocusing the editor using the following snippetp  precode        CKEDITOR.ondialogDefinition, function e              var dialog  e.data.definition.dialog             dialog.onhide, function                   dis.ckEditor.focusManager.hasFocus  true                 .cke.show                       codepre

Positive 658 pScenerio....p  pIm trying to upload a number of files to AWS through the Javascript API. While the number of files may be many 100  500, I am managing this by first sending the file information to my web server via Ajax to parse name, size, etc... and insert this information into my database.  I then return the id of the newly created record back to my web page and send the file to S3 using the id as the file name.  This way, I believe I am creating unique records and file names.p  pProblem...p  pSince my Ajax routine is in a for loop, so is the file upload to S3.  I cannot get this script to give me any valuable feedback on the upload progress the upload itself works fine.p  pAny of the following would make me happy...p  ol liA div with the total upload size all the files and the total progress reported.li liA list of all the files being uploaded with their totals and their amounts loaded.li liA div that reports 20 out of 520 files loadedli ol  pMy Code...p  precodevar aj  .ajax             url handler.php,             type POST,             data  packnameid packnameid,                     number number,                     name name                 ,             success functionresult                        Initialize the Amazon Cognito credentials provider                 AWS.config.region  useast1  Region                 AWS.config.credentials  new AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials                 IdentityPoolId ,                                   var bucket  new AWS.S3params Bucket traseindex                 var params  Key result.pdf, ContentType file.type, Body file                  bucket.uploadparams.onhttpUploadProgress, functionevt                  document.getElementByIdtotal.innerHTML  evt.total                 document.getElementByIdstatus.innerHTML  i  of   files.length     parseIntevt.loaded  100  evt.total                 console.logUploaded    parseIntevt.loaded  100  evt.total                  .sendfunctionerr, data                    document.getElementByIdtotal.innerHTML  i  of  files.length   complete                                        codepre  pNo matter how I update the httpUploadProgress piece, I fail to achieve my goal.

Negative 658 pI was reading this threadpost a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions262298windowscuitechnologyhttpstackoverflow.comquestions262298windowscuitechnologyap  pand am also wondering about a non .NET UI framework.  Specifically  prior to .NET having support for serial ports I cant believe they left that out of the first release of .NET I was forced to use MFC for an application.  I had not been a GUI developer and quickly found myself pulling my hair out due to the horrendous lack of ability for MFC to play nice with other threads in my app  e.g. calling a UI control method to update data or do other things from another thread.  Most of those challenges were dealt with, but the application code is so overly complex with messaging and the like just to handle the shortcomings of MFC.p  pSo  my question does the New and improved mfc have support for threads  i.e. if I call some mfc control for a gui object from another thread will it crashpuke like the old mfc, or can it play in the real worldp  pEDITp  pTo clarify  I understand the concern about munging with the GUI in separate threads, but what I was hoping for was that instead of the programmer creating custom messages and sending them from the worker threads  that the GUI framework would do all that work for me and I could just call the object methods from other threads.  Perhaps that is too much to hope for  especially if threads are not part of the language spec yet.p

Negative 658 h2How do I properly draw one vector object onto a specific position of another in ActionScript, accounting for positioning, transparency, etch2  pMy idea as suggested e.g. a hrefhttpwww.actionscript.orgforumsarchiveindex.php3t157588.html relnofollowherea was to use codebeginBitmapFillcode and codedrawRectcode to draw a bitmap copy made using codeBitmapData.drawcode of one MovieClip onto the .codegraphicscode property of the other MovieClip, but this proved more difficult than I thought, mainly for these reasonsp  ol lipstrikestrongTransparency is not preservedstrong where the source MovieClip is transparent, the target Graphics becomes white. Ive tried using a codeBlendModecode, but it doesnt help. It seems white pixels are actually copied into the BitmapData. I must be missing something, but I dont know what.strike It seems the problem was that the documentation for the codeBitmapDatacode constructor is wrong transparency does not default to emtrueem, but to emfalseem. So if you create a codenew BitmapDatax, y, truecode transparency is preserved, otherwise not. pli lipstrongPositioningstrong. If the source MovieClip is centered with the center at 0, 0, you have to apply a Matrix to move it when copying it to a BitmapData, or the bitmap will only contain the bottom right of the source MovieClip. Figuring out how much to move it is tricky, and I assume it involved getting the boundaries somehow. If the source object is perfectly centered within its canvas, you can simply offset it by half its width and height, of course.pli lipstrongcodebeginBitmapFillcode tilingstrong. It seems if you dont start the codedrawRectcode at 0, 0, the bitmap fill doesnt start from 0, 0 within the bitmap either. This means you have to shift the source bitmap once again, based on where you want to start drawing.pli ol  pThen theres other stuff like having to lineStyle0,0,0 so the drawRect doesnt draw a border etc.p  pAll this tricky trouble leads me to believe Im going about this the wrong way. Is there an easier way to do this Is there a library somewhere that can help me Has anyone successfully done this Perhaps my drawing canvas shouldnt be a Sprite but a Bitmap But then I dont know how to draw to it using codelineTocode etc.p  pstrongHeres the situationstrong I have a Sprite to which I draw using its .graphics, using lineTo etc. Now I want to use a MovieClip as a brush when drawing or just place a copy of another MovieClip on the drawing surface, making the other MovieClip part of the graphics of the first one.

Negative 658 pI need to speed up some particle system eye candy Im working on. The eye candy involves additive blending, accumulation, and trails and glow on the particles. At the moment Im rendering by hand into a floating point image buffer, converting to unsigned chars at the last minute then uploading to an OpenGL texture. To simulate glow Im rendering the same texture multiple times at different resolutions and different offsets. This is proving to be too slow, so Im looking at changing something. The problem is, my dev hardware is an Intel GMA950, but the target machine has an Nvidia GeForce 8800, so it is difficult to profile OpenGL stuff at this stage.p  pI did some very unscientific profiling and found that most of the slow down is coming from dealing with the float image scaling all the pixels by a constant to fade them out, and converting the float image to unsigned chars and uploading to the graphics hardware. So, Im looking at the following options for optimizationp  ulliReplace floats with uint32s in a fixed point 16.16 configurationli liOptimize float operations using SSE2 assembly image buffer is a 10247683 array of floatsli liUse OpenGL Accumulation Buffer instead of float arrayli liUse OpenGL floatingpoint FBOs instead of float arrayli liUse OpenGL pixelvertex shadersliul  pHave you any experience with any of these possibilities Any thoughts, advice Something else I havent thought ofp

In fact, my web is a frontend with almost no server whatsoever and uses AJAX to communicate with the backend.p  pEverything was going fine I developed and tested in Ubuntu 9.04 and Firefox 3.0 as a browser. One day I decided to see how my web did in IE8... horrorp  pNothing was working as it marvelously did in Firefox. To be more specific, the Request.HTMLs were not working. As I said, my web relied heavily on that, so nothing worked.p  pI spent a day trying to get something running but I had no luck.. The only conclusion to which I arrived was that the XML was incorrectly parsed I hope Im in mistake. Lets get to the codep  precodevar req  new Request.HTML         url serviceCatalog.groovy,          onSuccess functionresponseTree, responseElements               var catz  responseElements.filtercategory             catz.eachfunctioncat                  cat  cat                 var catid  cat.getid                 var subcategory  cat.getElementsubcategory                 alertcatid                 alertcat.gethtml                 alertsubcategory.gethtml                    ,        onFailure function...   codepre  pfor example, that piece of code. In firefox, it worked perfectly. It alerted an ID for example, 7, then it showed the contents of the category element, for examplep  precodeltsubcategory id1gt       ltcategoryidgt7ltcategoryidgt       ltcodegtACTIOltcodegt       ltnamegtActionltnamegt ltsubcategorygt codepre  pand then it showed the contents of some inner element, in this casep  precodeltcategoryidgt7ltcategoryidgt ltcodegtACTIOltcodegt ltnamegtActionltnamegt codepre  pIn IE8, the first alert worked OK alerted 7 but the next alert alertcat.gethtml gave an empty string and the last threw an Exception... it said something about subcategory beeing null.p  pWhat I concluded with this all is that the elements where parsed correctly in Firefox, but in IE8 I only got the tags and the attributes OK, everything else was completely wrong in fact, missing. I mean, the inner content of all the elements of the response where gonep  pOther fact you could use this code alertcat.gettag resulted in       Firefox category       IE8 category ltp  phmm what else... oh yeah... the line you see commented above cat  cat was something I tried to do to fix this. I read in the mootools Docs that IE needed to explicitly call the  function on elements to get all the Elementmagic ... but this didnt fix anything.p  pI was so desperate... I even fiddled arround with mootools.js codep  pOK, so... What I want you, dear mootoolpros is to help me solve this problem, for I REALLY need the web to function in IE8, and in fact I chose mootools to forget about compatibility problems...p  pWell... sorry for my shaky english and post length Thanks a million in advancep  pManuelp  pps if something is not clear, please ASK Id appreciate any help D p

Negative 658 pA lot of the LOB applications we provide to our customers are of a marketing  promotional nature sweepstakes, event registration, etc.... Most of the applications, while very simple, are very demanding on the database. Imagine a registration type site as the backing for a commercial that airs during the superbowl, for example yes, weve had several.p  pThough we have gotten very good at optimizing our web app code, the database always remains an issue, despite the application being relatively simple. The flow is typically something likep  ol liRead from database to detect existing recordli liWrite to database if record is newli ol  pIn many cases, this is all the data access our application needs to perform. However, given that it is the sole purpose of the application, its quite important that this simple process be optimized greatly.p  pFor the purposes of this question, we have a single server running a raid 5 disk array for the data files and another raid 5 array for the logs. At this time, the OS is Windows 2003 standard 32bit and the server has 4 GB of memory. Some apps use SQL 2005 standard while others use MySQL 5.1. Im strongvery well awarestrong that certain OS and hardware optimizations are possible here, but Im looking to address my needs from a software side first. Extensive profiling has taught us that strongdisk IO is generally the main bottleneckstrong.p  pHaving said all that, and knowing that caching wont help much since most reads are unique and return very little data often only a bit indicating whether a record exists or not, Im considering making a leap into the realm of inmemory databases as sort of a writecache layer to the real database. This seems like a good fit given that most of our high volume traffic is sporadic in nature, and not sustained over several hours. Additionally, the potential loss of a few minutes of data due to a server crash would be acceptable in most cases.p  pIn the simplest form, I would modify a typical registration app to do the followingp  ol liQuery the disk DB and memory DB for existing recordsli liIf none, write data to the memory DB and returnli liPeriodically flush memory DB to disk DBli ol  pstrongMy question isstrong what are my options for this intermediate inmemory database Ive experimented with inmemory hash tables, data tables, and such, but Im looking for other options or even suggestions for a completely different approach.p

Negative 658 pI have a Silverlight 3 app that that will let users download PDF files of static content.

Negative 658 pI am running a Perl server with 10 threads. They never get destroyed until the program exits, but this is something I intend to have as much uptime as possible, so thats why this is an issue for me. The threads handle a simple task many times. When I start the server and all the threads are started, I see that I have 288.30 MB free. After a couple iterations through each thread, it reports 285.96 MB free. That isnt so bad..maybe its just some stack space getting allocated or something during those iterations. But after 15 minutes, the free memory goes down to 248.24 MB What has happened to my memory Now, interestingly, it DOES plateau. It continues to slowly consume but not as quickly as at first. I thought maybe it was my fault so I tried double checking the scope of all my variables and even undefining all of them at the end of the thread loop.p  pI print out the free space after EVERY iteration of the threads so I can watch it slowly go down. Now what is also interesting is that it doesnt decrease every time. Sometimes the free memory stays the same after iterating.p  pI am using Perl 5.8.8 built from source on Linux 2.6p  pDoes anybody have any ideas at all or even suggestions as to what may be causing this I am considering upgrading my Perl to a later version to rule out a memory leak within the Perl core.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Could this be a thread stack size issue Could I be allocating more memory for the stack than I need. When I create my threads I dont change the setting from the default. Should I The threads doc says default is generally 16MB depending on system. 16x10 threads160MB  which could be the culprit. Thoughtsp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I built and installed Perl 5.12.1 and rebuilt the modules and everything. Been running the script for about an hour now and heres what Ive noticed. The memory usage is manageable now, but not ideal.  p  ul liAt the beginning just after spawning my threads seemed to be a bit lower. Down from 6066MB allocated to my 10 threads to 4550MB.li liAfter some iterations, their usage increased by 3MB total about the same as before. li liUp to this point is what I expected. All that memory upfront for the spawning, and then just a little bit for the variables I use in my threads. This is the part I dont like. After running for about 10 minutes, I lose an additional 65MB Why does it do this If it already iterated a few times fine with just 3MB, why keep allocatingli liIts been running for an hour and a half at this point and they arent using an additional 65MB anymore, its an additional 84MBli liIt slowly takes more memory BUT strange thing is that the amount of free memory is not decreasing each iteration. I print out the free memory before and after each iteration and it will stay the same for a while or hover  around a certain number for a while and then change by 510MB all of a sudden. I cant leave this running more than one, two days tops because it starts getting close to 8090 of my available memory.li ul  pAre there any other ideas Any at all I could try I am already undefing all my variables.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I really want to keep recompiling Perl with glibc as a last resort since I have found some reports that on some flavors of Linux it will segfault. So since I last posted I explored further the possibility of cycles in my hashes. Found nothing. So I spent the last few days analyzing my subroutine and caching anything that gets used in another iteration. A lot of new stuff gets recreated each time and Perl isnt cleaning up all of it even if I explicitly undef it all. So if it wont cooperate, I just wont destroy it. Will see if caching my objects help at all. Will post memory usage stats later.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Hm, very strange. Even after caching my data to be reused later the memory rises at about the same rate. It starts higher now because Im caching, but then keeps rising even though its mostly using my cached objects. Thats puzzling. Guess its time to give glibc a try...or else this is just a drawback of choosing Perl and will have to live with rebooting the server every couple days.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Tried without the caching, no glibc, again. Works fine for a while, a few hours, then it starts growing.

version of Perl 5.12 with threads and system malloc. Strangely I get the same behavior. Lose chunks of MBs at a time, slowly. Might try Valgrind to see why Im losing it. While I was playing around with something else though I thought of something else. My script creates and destroys allegedly many many SSL sockets. Is it possible that a widely used module such as IOSocketSSL leaks a little bit Or maybe OpenSSL Using v0.9.8o. Going to try synchronizing access to the SSL module to see if it has any effect, might have problems with threads accessing it.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Tried loading the modules separately within each thread, faster memory usage. Tried locking the areas using the socket functions so only one thread at a time used them, still lost memory the same as before. Increased the number of worker threads from 4 to 10 with the exact same amount of work. Memory didnt last 30min. Leads me to believe it is either a Perl problem internally with its thread implementation, or a stack problem no pun intended. I tried changing the stack size using the built in thread methods but same result. Going to look for another way. Maybe a lower level way. Increasing the number of threads makes the memory go faster...appears to be something with the threads stack implementation or the size of the stackp  pstrongUPDATE 9152010strong Found this interesting tidbit in the IOSocketSSL doc...p  blockquote   pThis is due to the fact that a circular reference is required to make IOSocketSSL sockets act simultaneously like objects and glob references.p blockquote  pCircular reference huh Another possible explanation is that these sockets are all sticking around for a while even though I explicitly undefd them.

Negative 658 pstrongEdit This turned out to be an issue with temporaries.  Basically, I was ignorantly using C as if it worked like Java or C, which it does not.  Hopefully, this will be a good cautionary tale.strongp  pEdit This issue only seems to happen with the combination of codejointviewcode and codesharedptrcode.  Raw pointers seem to work fine in the same scenario, as do shared pointers in a plain fusion container constructed w all its items at once, without adding anything more to it.  Details belowp  pemIm using mingw gcc 4.5.1em Running into a peculiar issue when using boost fusion containers and getting contents back out.  I have a custom class that gets wrapped in a codestdsharedptrcode, then thats handed to a fusion codemakelistcode or codemakevectorcode, doesnt seem to matter.  All is well if I can get all of my objects into the container at one time.  The problem seems to come up when I add another shared pointer to the container, which yields a codejointviewcode.  I iterate using a codefusionforeachcode and pass in a function object to print out the value.  If Im iterating a plain fusion container of shared pointers instead of a codejointviewcode, or a codejointviewcode with no shared pointers in it, it works fine, but otherwise, segmentation fault or garbage values.p  pBelow is a test program I made to try and isolate my problem.

Negative 658 pSo, I built a form in Access 2007, and put a subform on it.

Negative 658 pIve been reading about dependency injection, and I understand the basic concept that a method should receive what it needs from its caller rather than creating such items itself. As a result, codenewcode operators get removed from the method almost entirely certain basic objects would be exempt, of course  one example of this I found was for things like codeStringBuildercodes which seem like theyd be insane to have to pass in.p  pMy question sounds deceptively simple, but I suspect the answer is actually fairly complex Where do all of the codenewcode operators gop  pThe answer seems straightforward at first the codenewcode operator just gets pushed to the method which calls the method that needs the object. The problem with this, however, is that the calling method is likely also under test and so that codenewcode gets pushed up from calling method to calling method until eventually you get to a root method which at this point seems crazy untestable that creates an obscene amount of objects to get used at various points down the call stack. The situation becomes even more complicated when you consider that that root method is the root of a large variety of other methods, and so would need to create objects for every possibility. This also creates a performance problem since you would quickly be left with a large number of objects which are never actually used, but which must be instantiated anyway just in case.p  pIt is quite obvious to me that I have missed some vital piece of knowledge which is so apparent to other developers that nobody thinks to describe it in a blog post. However, I obviously cannot know what I do not know, so I humbly ask that I be let in on the secret Where do all the codenewcode operators gop  pI should mention that Im developing with PHP, so every request starts at the same point, and it seems like that root method in codeindex.phpcode would need to cover everything the application emcouldem do, in order to ensure it provides an object for everything it emwillem do in the current request. Again, theres a fundamental misunderstanding here, and Id really love to correct it.p

Negative 658 pI have a number of collection classes that implement their own custom update notification. It should be pretty easy to translate these notifications to an codeINotifyCollectionChangedcode implementation in a proxy class.p  pcodeINotifyPropertyChangedcode is already taken care of this question is just about collection proxies.p  pSo, what Im looking for is a way of creating the proxies that is relatively easy to use from XAML. This is particularly true for subcollections. The custom collection classes are part of a library that cannot be modified nor derived from. Its also not possible to replace the collection types with codeINotifyCollectionChangedcodecompatible equivalents, because the dataupdating code is outside my control.p  pId prefer a solution that works with SL as well, but its not a strict requirement.p  pSo far, I believe the following approaches are viablep  ul liDefine a codeTypeDescriptionProvidercode registered for the collection classes that adds a codeProxycode property. This allows Binding paths to dotinto the proxy. It seems that this solution is easiest from a XAML perspective, but is not SLcompatible.li liDefine a value converter that creates the proxies. This would work with a bit more work from the XAML side. It should work for SL. However, it may require intermediate visual elements to hold the value converter result if more than one value conversion is necessary on a path.li ul  pI looked into codeObjectDataProvidercode, but I dont think it can be used in this situation the proxy creation method must be generic on the type of objects in the container.p  pAny recommendations on which of these two approaches is better, or any other approachesp

Were using the SessionPerRequest pattern and one SessionFactory applicationwide, so the cache serves all NhibernateSessions.p  hr  pstrongProblemstrongp  pWe have to deal with different AccessRigths per user on the dataobjects in our legacydatabase Oracle  that is, views constrain the returning data per userrights. So theres the situation, where for example the same view is queried by our criteria with the excact same query, but returns a different resultset, depending on the userRights.p  pNow, to gain performance, the mentioned query is cached. But this gives us the problem, that when the query is first fired from an action of user A, it caches the resulting IDs, which are the IDs to which user A has access rights. Shortly after, the same query is fired from an action of user B and Nhibernate then picks the cached IDs from the first call from user A and tries to get the corresponding entities, to which User B doesnt have accessrights or maybe not for all of them. Were checking the rights with eventlisteners, so our appliction throws an accessrightexception in the mentioned case.p  hr  pstrongThoughtsstrongp  pNot caching the queries could be an option against this. But performance is cleary an issue in our application, so it would be really desirable to have cached queries userwise.p  pWe even thought about a SessionFactory per user, to have a cache per user, sort of. But this has clearly an impact on ressources, is somewhat of an overkill and honestly isnt an option, because there are entities, which have to be accessed, and are manipulated, by multiple users think of a usergroup, creating issues with stale data in the individual caches and so on. So thats a nogo.p  pemstrongWhat would be a valid solution for this Is there something like best practice for such a situationemstrongp  hr  pstrongIdeastrongp  pAs I was stuck with this yesterday, seeing no way out, I slept over it, and today I came up with some sort of a hack.p  pAs NHibernate caches the query by querytext and parameters clauses, I thought about a way, to smuggle something userdependent in that signature of the queries, so it would cache every query per user, but would not alter the query itself concerning the result of the query.p  pSo creativity guided me to this examplecodep  precodestring userName  GetCurrentUser ICriteria criteria  session.CreateCriteriatypeof EntityType             .SetCacheabletrue             .SetCacheModeCacheMode.Normal             .AddExpression.EqPropertyA, 1             .AddExpression.IsNotNullPropertyB             .AddExpression.Sqlstring.Format0  0, userName return criteria.List codepre  pThis linep  blockquote   p.AddExpression.Sqlstring.Format0  0, userNamep blockquote  presults in a whereclause, which always evaluates to true, but changes the query from Nhibernates viewpoint, so it caches per separate userName.p  pI know, its kind of ugly and Im not really pleased with it. strongDoes anybody knows any alternative approachstrongp  pthanks in advance.p

Negative 658 h2Lexer DFA results in code too large errorh2  pIm trying to parse Java Server Pages using ANTLR 3. p  pJava has a limit of 64k for the byte code of a single method, and I keep running into a code too large error when compiling the Java source generated by ANTLR.p  pIn some cases, Ive been able to fix it by compromising my lexer. For example, JSP uses the XML Name token, which can include a wide variety of characters. I decided to accept only ASCII characters in my Name token, which drastically simplified some tests in the and lexer allowed it to compile.p  pHowever, Ive gotten to the point where I cant cut any more corners, but the DFA is still too complex.p  h2What should I do about ith2  pAre there common mistakes that result in complex DFAsp  pIs there a way to inhibit generation of the DFA, perhaps relying on semantic predicates or fixed lookahead to help with the predictionp  pWriting this lexer by hand will be easy, but before I give up on ANTLR, I want to make sure Im not overlooking something obvious.p  h2Backgroundh2  pANTLR 3 lexers use a DFA to decide how to tokenize input. In the generated DFA, there is a method called codespecialStateTransitioncode. This method contains a codeswitchcode statement with a case for each state in the DFA. Within each case, there is a series of codeifcode statements, one for each transition from the state. The condition of each codeifcode statement tests an input character to see if it matches the transition.p  pThese charactertesting conditions can be very complex. They normally have the following formp  precodeint ch     ch is the next character in the input stream.  switchs   s is the current state.       case 13      if a lt ch ampamp ch lt z  A lt ch ampamp ch lt Z          s  24  If the character matches, move to the next state.      else if  codepre  pA seemingly minor change to my lexer can result in dozens of comparisons for a single transition, several transitions for each state, and scores of states. I think that some of the states being considered are impossible to reach due to my semantic predicates, but it seems like semantic predicates are ignored by the DFA. I could be misreading things thoughmdashthis code is definitely not what Id be able to write by handp  pI found an ANTLR 2 grammar in the Jsp2x tool, but Im not satisfied with its parse tree, and I want to refresh my ANTLR skills, so I thought Id try writing my own. I am using ANTLRWorks, and I tried to generate graphs for the DFA, but there appear to be bugs in ANTLRWorks that prevent it.p
Negative 658 pForgive me if Ive missed an obvious answer, but I have looked around for this and I cannot find it.  I am trying to build a multithreaded program that uses mutexes as little as possible.  The following is the basic design.  I want to know if Im recreating the wheel and, if I am, what design patternalgorithmapproach am I unwittingly borrowing fromp  pI have a global object that is basically a message queue for a bunch of threads.  Every time a thread is created it gets a function to which it submits messages.  Only the thread can access the function.  When a message is submitted to the function, the object takes the message and puts it into a queue.p  pThis is a FIFO queue that basically works as shared memory for interthread communication.  The thing is, only the global object can add or delete messages.  Every thread regularly checks the queue.  Every time it finds a message it can use, it copies the message to itself and then signals the global object that its read the data.  If a thread looks at the message and doesnt need it, then it still signals that it has read the message, but it doesnt copy it.  When every thread has looked at the data, the global object deletes the message.p  pThats it.  Its basic.  It eats up memory.  Its just meant to avoid locking variables, etc.p

Negative 658 pI found a very strange but 100 reproducible problem installing a 32bit custom BizTalk Adapter from a corresponding 32bit .MSI package authored with Wix v3.5 on Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1.p  pBasically, the installer runs fine and copies the appropriate files to the Program Files x86 folder and writes the corresponding registry entries under HKCUWow6432NodeCLSID to register the adapter.p  pIn the BizTalk Server Administration Console, when trying to add the adapter under the strongPlatform SettingsAdaptersstrong folder, I invoke the strongAdapter Propertiesstrong dialog box. There, I can successfully find the custom adapter in the strongAdapterstrong list and give it a friendly name, but when I attempt to validate the dialog box, I get the following errorp  blockquote   pCannot read transport configuration.

How can I write a body.onload function so that it would assign all input, select and button tags a tabindex number based upon the containing div For example, for the div I want to be cycled through first, all the input, select and button tags could have a codetabindex1code, and all the input, select and button tags in the second div could have codetabindex2code, and so on.p  pThanksp  pHeres a simplified examplep  precodeltstylegt   .a  display inlineblock        width200px        border 1px solid black    ltstylegt   ltdiv classagt     ltdiv idDiv01 titlethese inputs should have tabindex1gt         ltpgtDiv 01ltpgt         ltinput idDiv01Field1 typetext valueMe firstgt         ltinput idDiv01Field3 typetext valueMe secondgt         ltinput idDiv01Field2 typetext valueMe thirdgt         lthrgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idDiv03 titlethese inputs should have tabindex3gt         ltpgtDiv 03ltpgt         ltinput idDiv03Field1 typetext valueMe seventhgt         ltinput idDiv03Field2 typetext valueMe eighthgt         ltinput idDiv03Field3 typetext valueMe ninthgt         lthrgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idDiv05 titlethese inputs should have tabindex5gt         ltpgtDiv 05ltpgt         ltinput idDiv05Field1 typetext valueMe thirteenthgt         ltinput idDiv05Field2 typetext valueMe fourteenthgt         ltinput idDiv05Field3 typetext valueMe fifteenthgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classagt     ltdiv idDiv02 titlethese inputs should have tabindex2gt         ltpgtDiv 02ltpgt         ltinput idDiv02Field1 typetext valueMe fourthgt         ltinput idDiv02Field2 typetext valueMe fifthgt         ltinput idDiv02Field3 typetext valueMe sixthgt         lthrgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idDiv04 titlethese inputs should have tabindex4gt         ltpgtDiv 04ltpgt         ltinput idDiv04Field1 typetext valueMe tenthgt         ltinput idDiv04Field2 typetext valueMe eleventhgt         ltinput idDiv04Field3 typetext valueMe twelfthgt         lthrgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idDiv06 titlethese inputs should have tabindex6gt         ltpgtDiv 06ltpgt         ltinput idDiv06Field1 typetext valueMe sixteenthgt         ltinput idDiv06Field2 typetext valueMe seventeenthgt         ltinput idDiv06Field3 typetext valueMe eighteenthgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre

Negative 658 pAs shown in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5921884retrievingadbpediaresourcebyitsstringnamewithsparqlthis questiona which has a similar title, I would like to retrieve a dbpedia resource by knowing a part of its name. Im a beginner when it comes to SPARQL and such, but the example in the question helped me a lot, as the author searched for Romania, and the person answering hooked him up with a Sparql request to do the job. Thats nice, but heres the thing.p  pIn the example, they already knew that Romania is a country, hence the p  precode    c a dbpediaowlCountry  codepre  pin the WHERE clause. The complete sparql request beingp  precode    SELECT c     WHERE      c a dbpediaowlCountry      foafname Romaniaen .

The goal would be to search for anything, just knowing the name or a part of it. p  pIve been doing some research before asking you guys this question, and I already know that the part of the name problem could be resolved with bif function the bad way, since its not sparql compliant, or the CONTAINS clause, but I couldnt find any example showing how to use it.p  pLets now suppose that theres a word to search for among the dbpedia resources, that word would be an input from some user. And lets call it INPUT.p  pThe request, I would imagine, would look like p  precode   SELECT something WHERE         something a dbpedia Resource.     CONTAINSsomething,INPUT     codepre  pMy major question is about two major aspects p  ol liIs there anything that describes the type Dbpedia Resource  I dont think its in ontology or anything. By knwoing that I would like to search among all the resources to find one matching ...li liA specific name I would provide, or some string. I considered the FILTER option, but that would mean getting ALL the resources, and then filtering them by their name after they have been retreived, which would be, I guess, not so optimal.li ol  pSo, does anyone knows this Master Query to get a resource by providing its name, or a part of it  An example being providing Obama, and getting results not only for Barrack, but for Michelle as well.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 658 pIm writing a Javascript stacktrace library. The library needs to detect wether a particular object or function was created by the programmer or was there as part of the environment including builtin objects. Host objects are becoming a bit problematic due to their unpredictable behaviour, so Im after an environmentagnostic way to determine if a particular object in Javascript is a host object see a hrefhttpwww.ecmainternational.orgpublicationsfilesECMASTARCHECMA262,203rd20edition,20December201999.pdf relnofollowECMAScript 3a  4.3.8. However, distinguishing host objects from native objects and primitive values is useful for programmers in other projects, particularly in browserless environments, so Id like to focus on that, rather than the problems host objects cause in my library or on distinguishing programmercreated objects.p  pSo far Ive only been able to come up with solutions that depend on the environment running javascript code. For examplep  precode IE Only does not implement valueOf in Host Objects var isHost  typeof obj  object ampamp typeof obj.valueOf  undefined   Firefox Only Host objects have own constructor var isHost  obj.constructor ampamp obj.hasOwnPropertyconstructor codepre  pI noticed that jQuerys own a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comjQuery.isPlainObject relnofollowisPlainObjecta method is also dependent on environment, and that the logic is rather convoluted. p  pPerhaps this is because thats the nature of the beast with host objects since their behaviour is defined by the environment, but I would like to dig a bit further to see if this is possible and was wondering if somebody has run across this particular problem before and has a solution ready.p  pSo. Does anybody know a simple platformindependent solution to test for Host Objects And if it runs in a browserless environment such as Node or Rhino all the better for it.p  pPossible approaches that may not workp  ul liTesting for characteristics of host objects seems like a lost cause, given that there is no specification for their behaviour, however testing whether the object is part of the ES3 specification may be a possibility. li liI have tried using codeObject.prototype.toStringcode given that its defined quite specifically, but the results are inconclusive as some environments namely IE choose to return the same value for native and host objects.li liIt may be possible to do this by checking whether the ultimate codeconstructorcode of an object through the prototype chain really is an codeinstanceof Functioncode.li ul

Negative 658 pIve got two separate, unconnected and unconnectable Oracle databases. I need to get information from one to the other as quickly and painlessly as possible.p  pTypically what Ive done up until now when in this situation is create a staging area for the data that needs to be imported essentially a temporary table just for storing the data until Im done merging. I copy emallem of the data that emmightem be needed from the source to that staging area. Then I merge the data as I would if the two tables were connected, meaning of course that I can filter out whatever data I dont need at that time.p  pHeres the problem in my current case. The source table is emextremelyem large and entirely emunindexedem something over which I have no control, ugh. That means it takes strongforeverstrong to get the necessary data if I dont filter it in some way. In addition the destination table really only needs a relatively small subset of the data to do what it needs to do, maybe ten thousand or so distinct rows at a time. In this case I dont want to copy emallem of the data that emmightem be needed. I just want to copy over the emexactem data that will be needed, or as close to that as possible.p  pstrongtldr versionstrongp  pstrongExactly how do I limit my select on the source table based on what I need in the destination table if they cant communicate with each otherstrongp  pFor example, I might select IDs for the data that is needed in the destination and build the query for the source table based on that.

Negative 658 pI can already create a ball in a panel on MousePressed and MouseReleased and update coordinates with MotionListener and change the color of the ball when the mouse is over it.

Negative 658 pThe new GAE a hrefhttpcode.google.comappenginedocsadminconsoletrafficsplitting.html relnofollowtraffic splittinga feature was released today and one of its intended uses is for multivariate testing.  This would seem to imply that you must build and deploy multiple versions of your application, one for each variant of the test, which implies that youve branched your version control system one branch per test as well.  This seems like an inefficient way to manage testing.  It also does not appear to include any kind of framework for managing the tests, unlike a hrefhttpswww.google.comanalyticssiteopt relnofollowGoogles Website Optimizera which includes user interfaces for managing multiple tests and also includes all the statistics gathering and analysis tools.p  pIs anyone thinking of using the new traffic splitting feature for multivariate testing  Why use this over Website Optimizer  How would you set up traffic splitting tests  would you branch your version control system and also write your own infrastructure for measuring and and analyzing tests  Or rather than write your own code, is there a multivariate testing library that would work well for this purposep

Negative 658 pI inherited a project using the Twisted Python library. The application is terminating after the user logs off of Windows XP. p  pThe Python code has been converted to an executable using bbfreeze. In addition, the bbfreeze generated executable is registered as a Windows service using the instsrv.exe and srvany.exe.p  pIve taken a simple chat example from the Twisted website and create an executable from bbfreeze and registered it with instsrv and srvany and the same problem occurs the executable stops running after the user logs off.p  pIm inclined to think that something about Windows XP and the Twisted librarys is causing the application to terminate or stop running. In particular, I think it might be something within the reactor code thats causing the application code to stop running.

Negative 658 pI am working with a UI using tabs in the ActionBar.   When switching between tabs I am currently managing the Tab click events in my Activity and am calling attach and detach as needed using FragmentManager.p  pEach time a Fragment is attached I am going through the full lifecycle and creating a new view and loading all my data over again.   I am using the given Bundle in onSaveInstanceState and onActivityCreated to update gui elements mainly the scroll position of a list.p  pThis is working OK, but has lots of overhead.  In my case the list may have 300 or so records and there is a noticeable delay when switching between tabs.p  pIn an effort to speed things up I am now saving the root view in onCreateView as a class variable.  Then when onCreateView is called again as a result of the fragment being attached I test for a non null value for my root view and return it instead of reinflating the view.  This saved view still has the appropriate data set and I also bypass loading the data in this case.   Of course I still need to fully rebuild the view and data if the Fragment is destroyed by OS while in the background.p  pMy question is if this is a valid approach  I dont see a downside to it unless there are memory issues to worry about.   p

Negative 658 psorry if this all seem nooby and unclear, but Im currently learning Netlogo to model agentbased collective behavior and would love to hear some advice on alternative software choices. My main thing is that Id very much like to take advantage of PyCuda since, from what I understand, it enables parallel computation. However, does that mean I still have to write the numerical script in some other environment and implement the visuals in yet another onep  pIf so, my questions arep  ol lipWhat numerical package should I use PyEvolve, DEAP, or something else It appears that PyEvolve is no longer being developed and DEAP is just a wrapper on the outdated EAP.pli lipGraphicwise, I find mayavi2 and vtk promising. The problem is, none of the numerical package seems to bind to these readily. Is there no better alternative than to save the numerical output to datafile and feed them into, say, mayavi2pli lipAnother option is to generate the data via Netlogo and feed them into a graphing package from 2. Is there any disadvantage to doing thispli ol  pThank you so much for shedding light on this confusion.p

Negative 658 pI have an issue with dynamic datatable in java. I am creating multiple dynamic datatable in one simple toggle panel.

When i click on any commandlink in the table it opens the modal panel but doesnt display any data. when i refresh the page again then click on the commandlink the modal panel is showing the data. p  pSo the issue is first time when datatable generates and i click on any link required data never comes up in the modal panel in the first button click. but if i go back and again come back to the same page then required data comes up in the modalpanel. Please suggest me the solution for this.p  pI have also noticed strange thing by comparing  view source of the page loads first time and second time, datatable name comes up without form name in first time like DATATABLENAME and second time datatable name comes up with form name e.g. formNameDATATABLENAMEp  pI have been copying the logs of the datatable twice.

Negative 658 pIm working on making my two Minecraft servers easier to access. Ive attempted a few solutions, but so far, none have worked effectively.p  pI have a normal vanilla Minecraft server listening on mysite.com25560, and a Tekkit Minecraft server listening on mysite.com25570. That is, both Minecraft servers are running on the same machine. They work properly when users directly connect to the server with the port specified.p  pThe vanilla server was initially listening on mysite.com25565, the standard Minecraft port. I have changed it so I can allow Apache to listen at mysite.com25565 and redirect traffic appropriately, but thats not working so far.p  pWhat Id like to be able to do is have all requests sent to mine.mysite.com be redirected to mysite.com25560, and have all requests sent to tekkit.mysite.com be redirected to mysite.com25570. I understand that the DNS itself is not capable of managing this reroute, since DNS only handles domain names and IP addresses.p  pAfter a suggestion of a friend, my latest attempt has been reconfiguring Apache, as I earlier stated, to listen on port 25565 and proxy the traffic to the correct port. This is a section of my apache2.confp  precodeListen 25565  NameVirtualHost 25565  ltVirtualHost 25565gt     ServerName tekkit.mysite.com     ServerAlias www.mysite.com     ltProxy gt         Order allow,deny         Allow from all     ltProxygt     ProxyPreservehost On    ProxyPass  www.mysite.com25570     ProxyPassReverse  mysite.com25570 ltVirtualHostgt  ltVirtualHost 25565gt     ServerName mine.mysite.com     ServerAlias www.mysite.com     ProxyPreserveHost On     ltProxy gt         Order allow,deny         Allow from all     ltProxygt    ProxyPass  mysite.com25560     ProxyPassReverse  mysite.com25560 ltVirtualHostgt codepre  pThe commentedout lines with ProxyPass cause Apache to start with an error     ProxyPass URL must be absolutep  pTo see if I could make it work properly, I then tried substituting a hrefhttpwww.mysite.com2556060 relnofollowhttpwww.mysite.com2556060a in the respective places, and while Apache does start without any errors, users are not able to connect to the server. I believe this is because the Minecraft server does not redirect a HTTP request to a server connection, whichever protocol that may be.p  pThis has led me to believe that Apache wont be helpful in handling nonHTTP requests. If I am mistaken, how might I make Apache correctly redirect subdomain traffic to a port Otherwise, can anyone suggest a way to do this without Apache I have access to all standard Linux  Ubuntu utilities. Ive been searching for quite some time without progress.p  pThanksp

Negative 658 pIve been trying to find out why my SQLite database is performing relatively slowly 4 seconds to insert 1500 records and I think Ive narrowed it down to this query.

The reason for this is because the loop inserts data into other tables codeWIDcode, codeFriendIDcode, codeUniverseIDcode, codeGalaxyIDcode so I dont have that data until its been inserted. I need this data to insert into the codeMainFramecode table but this feels like a brute force approach. Any advicep
Negative 658 pIve been learning Rails 3 with Devise and, so far, seem to have it working quite well. Ive got custom session amp registration controllers, recaptcha is working and a signedin user can upload an avatar via carrierwave, which is saved on S3. Pretty happy with my progress.p  pNow Im writing Rspec tests. Not going so well I have a reasonable User model test, but thats because I found it online httpsgithub.comRailsAppsrails3deviserspeccucumber and was able to add to it by following Michael Hartls excellent Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial.p  pMy real problem is controller test and integration tests, especially controller tests. Initially I thought Id be able to convert the tests in Michaels book, and I have to a small degree, but its slow progress and I seem to be constantly hitting my head against a brick wall  partly, I think, because I dont know Rspec and capybara so well have made some very dumb mistakes but also because I dont really understand Devise well enough and am wondering if Devise plays as nicely as it might with Rspec I read somewhere that, because Devise is Rack based, it might not always work as one might expect with Rspec. Dont know if thats true or notp  pI know some people will wonder why this might be necessary since Devise is a gem and therefore already tested but Ive had a couple of instances where changes elsewhere have broken login or registration without me immediately realizing. I think a good set of controller amp integration tests would have solved this.p  pIf I was able to do this myself I would and Id publish it for others but, so far, writing these tests has been extremely painful and I really need to move on to other things.p  pIm sure I wouldnt be the only one who could use this.

Negative 658 pMy question is very simple, I basically have 2 apps that want to access a pasteboard that I created for the 2 apps. What I want to know is lets say I saved a string to the pasteboard, and shut off the phone. When I restart the phone and open the 2nd app, will the string I saved before still be therep  pI know pasteboards can be set to persistent by setting a property, but there doesnt seem to be any documentation on the data within the pasteboards. So do data persist along with the pasteboard or do they disappear and only the pasteboard remain after a system restartp

Negative 658 pI know this has already been covered a great deal, but I promise this one is different. I am making an app that must support OpenGL ES 1.1 as well as OpenGL ES 2.0, and I want to know if there is a way of implementing a custom matrix stack in emOpenGL ES 1.1em that also works with 2.0. If not, is it efficient to create a separate context or something and grab the matrix data from that and putting it into an OpenGL ES 2.0 shader My main goals here are to be able to write a single function for everything, not one version of each function for each version of OpenGL ES.p  pI am solving this to some extent by writing a sort of wrapper for OpenGL ES that calls the appropriate things for the OpenGL ES version, but I am noticing that the OpenGL ES 2.0 matrix class CC3GLMatrix, as used a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com3664opengles20foriphonetutorial relnofollowherea is much slower than the traditional OpenGL ES 1.1 matrix stack, so I want to find a more efficient way of doing it, or simply use the old matrix stack.

Negative 658 pI have an issue where when I build my app using LLVM, it runs terribly slow compared when it is not enabled. This seems to be an issue specific to iPhone 5.

Negative 658 pI have the following code to overload the  and  operators respectively for the class Date.

Negative 658 pIm primarily interested in the Unixlike systems e.g., portable POSIX as it seems like Windows does strange things for wide characters.p  pDo the read and write wide character functions like codegetwcharcode and codeputwcharcode always do the right thing, for example read from utf8 and write to utf8 when that is the set locale, or do I have to manually call codewcrtombcode and print the string using e.g. codefputscode On my system openSUSE 12.3 where codeLANGcode is set to codeenGB.UTF8code they do seem to do the right thing inspecting the output I see what looks like UTF8 even though strings were stored using wchart and written using the wide character functions.p  pHowever I am unsure if this is guaranteed. For example a hrefhttpwww.cprogramming.comtutorialunicode.htmlcprogramming.coma states thatp  blockquote   p[wide characters] should not be used for output, since spurious zero   bytes and other lowASCII characters with common meanings such as    and n will likely be sprinkled throughout the data.p blockquote  pWhich seems to indicate that outputting wide characters presumably using the wide character output functions can wreak havoc.p  pSince the C standard does not seem to mention coding at all I really have no idea whowhenhow coding is applied when using wchart. So my question is basically if reading, writing and using wide characters exclusively is a proper thing to do when my application has no need to know about the encoding used. I only need string lengths and console widths codewcswidthcode, so to me using wchart everywhere when dealing with text seems ideal.p

Negative 658 pSo Im trying to create an abnormal combobox using ExtJs 4 and Im running into a slight issue which I cant figure out how to resolve. I got the basics down with the code that follows. As of right now I am able to get the dropdown to show all the addresses in a proper format and when I click on the proper address it properly shows the Street1 value in the input.p  pHere is what Im stuck on Im trying to add an initial item to the combobox that basically says something like Add New Address that the user can select. Im planning on having this open a modal where the user can input a new address, save it and then have it be displayed back in the combobox, but all of that should be fairly simple I cant seem to figure out a way of adding just a simple Add New Address and then tracking the value to see if that value is returned to know to make the modal appear or not. I dont want to add it to the store as I assume that will add an item in the database and Id prefer that not happen for the Add New Address.p  pAny thoughts on how to get that to work From below you can see that LocationStore is my store and that the general address components apply.p  pThank you in advance.p  pComboBox Codep  precode      xtype combobox,      anchor 100,      listConfig           emptyText Add New Address  Empty Text,          itemTpl lttpl ifNamegtNameltbr gtlttplgtlttpl ifStreet1gtStreet1ltbr gtlttplgtlttpl ifStreet2gtStreet2ltbr gtlttplgtCity, StateOrProvince PostalCode      ,      emptyText Add New Location  tester,      fieldLabel Street 1,      name Street1,      allowBlank false,      blankText Street 1 Required,      displayField Street1,      forceSelection true,      store LocationStore,      typeAhead true,      valueField Street1,      valueNotFoundText Add New Location  , codepre

For some reason we would like to modify the codePersoncode table in a backwardincompatible way.p  pOne potential solution for keeping compatibility is to rename the table to codeUsercode and to create a codePersoncode view that provides the same interface as the legacy table. Add emon insertem, emon updateem and emon deleteem triggers as needed.p  pThe approach has the problem that we might run out of available semantically correct names after a few changes.p  pIs there a wellknown best practice for namespacing the schema interface according to the DB versionp  pAlternatively, is there a better way to maintain backwardcompatibilityp

However, its not clear to my why an untyped or rawtyped generic class would mean that generic methods are not honoured. p  pIt transpires that this issue has already been raised on SO, c.f. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11007723combiningrawtypesandgenericmethodsthis questiona. The answers to this explain that when a class is untyped  in its rawform, emallem generics are removed from the class  including typing of generic methods.p  pHowever, there isnt really an explanation as to why this is the case. So allow me to clarify my questionp  ul liWhy does Java remove generic method typing on untyped or rawtype generic classes Is there a good reason for this, or was it just an oversightli ul  pEDIT  discussion of JLSp  pIt has been suggested in answer to the previous SO question and to this question that this is treated in a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasespecsjlsse7htmljls4.htmljls4.8JLS 4.8a, which statesp  blockquote   pThe type of a constructor 8.8, instance method 8.4, 9.4, or nonstatic field 8.3 M of a raw type C that is not inherited from its superclasses or superinterfaces is the raw type that corresponds to the erasure of its type in the generic declaration corresponding to C. p blockquote  pIt is clear to me how this relates to an untyped class  the class generic types are replaced with the erasure types. If the class generics are bound, then the erasure type corresponds to those bounds. If the they are not bound, then the erasure type is Object  e.g. p  precode unbound class types public class MyGenericClassltTgt    public T doSomethingT t  return t   MyGenericClass untyped  new MyGenericClass Object t  untyped.doSomethingString   bound class types public class MyBoundedGenericClassltT extends Numbergt    public T doSomethingT t  return t   MyBoundedGenericClass bounded  new MyBoundedGenericClass Object t1  bounded.doSomethingString  does not compile Number t2  bounded.doSomething1  does compile codepre  pWhilst generic methods are instance methods, it is not clear to me that JLS 4.8 applies to generic methods. The generic methods type codeltKgtcode in earlier example is not untyped, as its type is determined by the method parameters  only the class is untyped  rawtyped.p

Negative 658 pI am working on an ASP MVC application with EF5. We are trying to update a User object, which contains a list of permissions, groups and a foreign key for the Role object.

Negative 658 pSince switching to storyboards, I load a view controller viap  precode[self performSegueWithIdentifieridentifier senderself] codepre  pThis works perfectly. Now, if I want to set any properties on the destination view controllers, I implement the method codeprepareForSeguesendercode and set what properties I need to set. Everything works as expected without any problems.p  pEver since I starting using this approach over the old p  precodeMyViewController vc  .... vc.prop  value [self.navigationController pushViewControllervc] codepre  pIve felt that passing parameters to the destination view controller is a little hacky, in particular if the value youre trying to set is not just a static value.p  pLets say for example, I have a button which fetches some data from a server. When the data returns, it creates a new object, and then presents a new view controller to display this object. To do this, I call codeperformSegueWithIdentifiersendercode, but thats the end of it. My object is now deallocated and no longer exists, and I have no way of passing it to the codeprepareForSeguesendercode method, unless I store it in an instance variable.p  pThis feels pretty horrible, as the object isnt meant to last longer than this action, and has no relation to anything else in my current view controller.p  pIn this situation, I understand that I could quite simply request the data in the new view controller but its just an example.p  pMy question is, is there another way of doing this without it feeling so hacky Can I get this data into the destination view controller without storing it in an instance variablep  pI know I could still use the old approach, but Id like to stick with the storyboard methods if I can.p

Negative 658 pI want to develop a desktop app for Windows, and have recently contacted a designer to make the wireframes Ive made really awesome. After the design is finished, I want it to be ported 100 to the app.p  pAs in web development, this is the normal process. You create the design, and then from the PSD files you create the website using HTML and CSS, which is normally not a bit problem for someone who knows what hes doing.p  pDoing this for the windows app, Im not so sure. What Im looking at is a design that is totally not standard, all the elements and the design is totally different from a normal look and standard elements like buttons, forms etc. will look totally different.p  pThe question now is strongWhats the best option to accomplish thisstrong p  pIve read alot lately about the GUI implementation possibilities, and what Ive come across is that WPF is the way to go, that its really flexible, and the fact that it uses a similar approach like HTML for building the UI gives me hope that its possible. p  pSo, a question to all the UI experts out here What technology  UI library would be best to use Is .NET with WPF powerful enough to create a 100 nonstandard design Im looking at custom graphs and charts as well.p  pLooking forward to your inputp
Negative 658 pIm building a set of custom claims, each of which defines information about a user, such as Age, Gender, Address, etc. Claims are then stored in the database as keyvalue pair. Claim types can be added dynamically so that user information can be expanded if required.p  pHowever, Ive encountered a slight limitation which is requirement that claim values are strings. In particular, this is rather visible in situations where there is large number of users   100.000 and I would like to perform a complex search query where i.e. Im looking for all users with age  50. Assuming that BirthDate is another claim stored as string in the database, there is definitely a loss on the SQL performance between two scenarios of issuing query directly against column of datetime type, or searching through claim sets for all users.p  pHow to deal with thisp

Negative 658 pI want to make an app that allows users to download static images of maps and redistribute them in Anki flashcard decks. However, Im having a tough time figuring out how to generate the map images without facing any licencing restrictions or running my own server. I want my app to be all client side JavaScript which rules out one of the solutions Ive found so far. Ive seen a way to use openlayers to a hrefhttpdev.openlayers.orgsandboxcamptocampcanvasopenlayersexamplesexportMapCanvas.html relnofollowexport images from the canvasa, however a proxy sever is required to convert the canvas to a dataURL so it can be saved.p  pThe most promising option Ive found so far is the MapQuest a hrefhttpdevblog.mapquest.com20110511getcreativewiththeopenstaticmapsapi relnofollowOpen Static Maps APIa. However, I cant find much information about how open it really is. The OSM data is open, but Im not sure about the images themselves, as they say copyright mapquest on them. Mapbox also has a static map API with licensing restrictions that are unclear to me.p

Negative 658 pIm trying my hand at using Firebase and AngularFire for an app I am building. I am admittedly a newcomer to angular and Firebase, so any help would be appreciated.p  pI have the following database structure in Firebasep  ul liEPICS ul liEpic 1 ul liIdli liTitle, etc.li ulli liEpic 2 ul liIdli liTitle, etc. li ulli ulli lipUSERSp  ul lipUser 1p  pactiveepicsp  ul lipactive epic 1pli lipactive epic 2pli ulli ulli ul  pOn the following page, I have a ngrepeat for each epic in the database. Each epic has a row of buttons, one of which is giving me trouble. If the current user has already started the epic e.g. the epic appears in activeepics for that user, then the button should say Tap Out. If the epic is not in the users activeepics, then it should display Start. p  pThe button should do different things when it is clicked, depending on the button label. So if the button label says Start, the app should add the epic into the current users activeepics and change the button label to Tap Out. In contrast, if the button label is Tap Out, the app should remove the epic from activeepics and change the button label back to Start. p  pHowever, I am getting all sorts of weird behavior. The app displays the correct button labels when I use dummy ids such as 1 or 0. However, when I add an epic with a Firebase generated ID, all labels reset to Start. Ive also noticed that the app is looping through each epic multiple times I entered a debug console.log for each epic displayed. p  pI think the problem may be that I have multiple promise objects after binding the Firebase data to scope.

Negative 658 pI have started using a hrefhttptfsintegration.codeplex.com relnofollowTFS Integration Toolsa to migrate work items from one TFS2010 project to another team project within the same collection. After some small trial runs and modifications to the field and value mappings I started a migration on our entire product backlog. Approximately 170000 change groups were discovered and analyse started. However, during the analysis the connection to the TFS server was lost so the migration had to be restarted. After the restart approx 340000 change groups were identified roughly double without any significant changes being made to work items in the backlog.p  pHas anyone experienced a similar problem or are aware of settings or changes that can be made in the tool to limit this increase in change groups The amount of time taken to analyse so many groups is causing the migration to take much longer that was initially expected.p

Negative 658 pThe more reading I do on this, the more confused I get.p  pWe have a large solution developed in c, and it has a project that is set up as a COM object. The project I am working on is in another solution, but I need to load that COM object. Ive tried using TlbImp to create a map so I can do early loading of the object, but I get an error T10000 The input file ... is not a valid type library. Ive loaded this as a COM object in VFP, so I know it is a COM object which may be different from what this message is telling me. p  pIve looked into adding a reference to it in VS, but I am told the activex type library was exported from a .net assembly and cannot be added as a reference. A search on this brought up a suggestion of adding a reference using the Browse tab, but this would create a link that would need to be changed on each developers system depending on their directory structure. I would also rather not include a copy of the dll this is a COM object, so including the dll seems to defeat the purpose.p  pIve also looked into late binding, but I dont like the speed hit that I would have to take. This cant be as difficult as it seems to be I am sure I am missing some very simple thing. If anyone can provide insight into my situation, I would greatly appreciate it.p

Negative 658 pIve been struggling on strongusing the same categories used on regular posts on custom postsstrong, so I can query custom posts based on categories too.p  pThing is, the custom posts werent created using coderegisterposttypecode at all, they are created by just using codewpinsertpostcode with a different post type, forcingly creating a new type that doesnt support categories at all, so querying with categories has no use. The page is live, so there are a few important custom posts in the database already, without support for categories.p  pSo, if I made a call to coderegisterposttypecode in codeinitcode now to add categories by adding the codetaxonomies gt arraycategorycode parameter, would new custom posts be queriable, without destroying the old, existing posts in the database Or should I try something else entirelyp  pIve thought about using meta data for the custom posts, but I want to keep integrity between regular and customs categories.p  pThanks for the attention.p

You used a racing wheelpedals to drive and the mouse to control all the buttons and switches etc. We use raycasting from the mouse point on the screen into the world to interact with the various controls in the vehicle. p  pNow that were using the oculus, the raycast isnt taking into account the distortion matrix used on the oculus cameras. So youre not actually casting a ray at what youre visually clicking on. Using Debug.DrawRay I found that it was slightly off. Just to be sure, I disabled the lens correction via inspector on the OVRCameraController and sure enough the raycasting was working again.p  pThe ray itself is calculated the usual way one does when firing from the mouse point  ScreenPointToRayInput.mousePositionp  pWould anyone have any idea how I can adjust my ray so it works with lens correction onp  pCheers, Gordonp

Negative 658 pIm writing a server in C. The asynchronous example on msdn.microsoft.com suggests the following.p  ol liBeginAccept to listen for client amp start a new thread when client calls.li liBeginReceive to receive the data from client  amp start a new thread to do it on.li liBeginSend to reply to send data to client  amp start yet another thread to it on.li ol  pAt this point there seems to be 4 separate threads, when from my possibly naive point of view there really only needs to be 2. 1 for the server to keep listening on and 1 for the conversation with the client. Why does my conversation with the client need 3 threads since I have to wait for a reply before I send and I wont be doing anything else while waiting to receive data from the clientp  pCheersp
Negative 658 pHave read at many location that we can limit the application for installation by specifying APPABI in Application.mk place usually under jni directory. p  pWhat I could not find out that if putting just Application.mk with line APPABI  armeabiv7a in jni folder with nothing else in it and building the app using just ant also limit the application in the same way p  pI am not sure how the filtering works in playstore but here is the situation. p  ol liHave an Android project with libs folder containing prebuilt armeabiv7a libraries. li lijni folder does not have anything. i.e. we dont use NDK for building any component of the app ourselves.

Negative 658 pIm starting the process of converting an app to Core Data.  I built the data model and, at first, got Xcode to successfully create codeNSManagedObjectcode custom classes corresponding to the entities. But then I realized the entity and class names didnt have my application prefix, which I thought would dramatically increase the workload of required coding changes for the conversion to Core Data.  p  pSo I removed the references to the custom classes, renamed my entities in the data model with my prefix, reset the class attribute for each entity to default, and tried to create the custom classes again. I get through the wizard just as before, but now Xcode refuses to create classes for the entities, and instead creates one headerimplementation pair with the application name. The .h and .m files correspond to the entity Im classing or the last entity in the list when I select multiple, but the names and relationships are invalid, of course, and so are useless. Can anyone explain why Xcode is doing this, and how to resolve itp

Negative 658 pIm trying to layout a simple UI for iPhone using Xcodes Interface Builder such that you have a text box and button at the top, and a tableview immediately beneath it filling the rest of the available space. There will be a top bar that I need to allow for as well. For the life of me though, I cant figure out how to lay it out so that it looks good in the simulator. I also find it looks radically different between simulator and IB.p  pHere is what I currently have in IB. Notice how the top bar has space reserved, and the text box and send button is placed a solid inch or so below emthatem, with very little space between those two controls and the tableview below. Note the huge gap between top bar and text box is only there because anything less causes the top bar in the simulator to overlap the text box.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0w35C.png altInterface Builderp  pAnd here is how it shows up in the simulator.

Negative 658 pI found this code on the internet and have been playing around with it. It adds text to any point on a canvas. This is great however when new text is added to the canvas the previous text is deleted. Is there an easy way for multiple instances of text to exist on the canvas simultaneously p  pIm new to JS and cant see anything in the code that deletes the text once new text is saved. Im really hoping that I wont have to save all the text in an array along with the x and y coordinates, Im nowhere near skilled enough to do that.p  pThe code Im using is below, but wont work without some external JS, so here is a link to the working version I copied it from. a hrefhttpoldstatic.travisberry.comdemoscanvastextdemoindex.html

Negative 658 pI have a JTable which is formed by importing data from a text file. It is a huge table with about 522 columns and thousands of rows. Many cells in this table are empty as well.  Now, I want to be able to apply some mathematical operations to the data available in certain columns. So right now, I can select multiple columns, but I dont know how to go about getting these values. I know Ill need an array of arrays where I can store the value from the table columns and then modify each value based on my algorithm. Right now, to start it off simply, I just want to be able to print out the values in the select column just one to keep it simple but I cant do that, I get the value of a particular cell printed 24 times.

Negative 658 pGiven a matrix m how can I do a t.test on the rowsvariable testing if mean is different from zero and get a matrix where each column corresponds to e.g. the t.teststatistic and t.testp.value for the rows. Since some rows have several NAs I at the same time want to make sure the t.test doesnt fail from this thus in this case the row of the resulting matrix would be NA in both the t.teststatistic and t.testp.value columns. I thought of something like whats shown below but I cannot get it right. In the end I need to do this on a list of matrices but figure that once I can do it on a single matrix I can use lapply on the list of matrices.

Negative 658 pIm writing a basic notepad application on Swing. I have a Java Swing Menu. Its basically a codeJMenuBarcode with codeJMenuscode in it. One of the menus is a Formatmenu with a Font size menu inside itSee image. The font size menu is supposed to have a list of numbers where I can choose the font size. But I cant seem to find a good solution for this.p  pIve tried using codeJComboBoxcode and codeJListcode, but I need the GUI looking like it does in the image. In other words, it cant be a collapseddropdown menu, nor can it be in its own window. Anyone have any suggestions as to how I can do thisp  pEDIT Important to take notice of is that I need the values sent to an codeActionListenercode. What you see in the image are just normal codeJMenuItemscode. But for me to send the intvalues of each codeJMenuItemcode to an codeActionListenercode I would need 3 different codeActionListenerscode. And they would need to be hard coded.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGF7iY.png altenter image description herep

When ever you change the data jus after it is synced. The FromDatetoSeconds functions returns a timestamp which is lesser than the last server sync timestamp. I see a difference of 115secondsp  pI dont understand how this is possible. Does UtcNow return the correct time Or is it off by 1020 secsp  pSome help would be appreciated. p

Negative 658 pI am learning how to write functions in C to accept an array and return a modified array.p  pIn function codetestfunccode which is supposed to simply add code10code to each element of input array codebcode I am allocating memory for codenptscode number of integers using codemalloccode. But since I want to return this array using a pointer, I am not freeing this memory at the end of the function. Suppose I call this function code100code times like I am doing in the code, so what happens to the all the memory allocated during the code  Is the amount of memory used by the code code100104code bytes  For a function which doesnt work on dynamic memory allocation, I think memory allocated to variables disappears when the function returns the final value and when it is called again, it again allocates memory and so on. But I am confused as to what happens in this case.p  pi cannot free the allocated memory inside the function since i need it to return the array to the main function, but also i need to call this function more than 100 times for different arrays, so if it keeps on allocating again and again, it will run out of memory p  pAnd is there a way to check how much memory a code is using  other than looking at Activity Monitor on MacOSX.p  pThanks p  precode code to test returning array from functions   include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltmath.hgt  int testfuncint a,int npts  int mainint argc, char argv[]      int b     int a[10],i,j,npts10      bint  mallocsizeofintnpts      for j0 j lt100 j              printfiteration number d n,j         for i0 iltnpts i                      a[i]i             printfd n,a[i]                   btestfunca,npts          printfreturned array n         for i0 iltnpts i                      printfd n,b[i]                   printfthe size of one integer is d n,sizeofint      return 0  int testfuncint b,int npts      int c     int i0      cint  mallocsizeofintnpts      for i0 iltnpts i              c[i]b[i]10           return c  codepre  hr  pThis is the possible solution to avoid allocating memory inside a function and being able to call the function multiple timesp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltmath.hgt  void testfuncint c,int d,int npts  int mainint argc, char argv[]      int a,b     int i,j,npts10      amallocsizeofintnpts     bmallocsizeofintnpts      for j0 j lt100 j              printfiteration number d n,j         for i0 iltnpts i                      a[i]i             printfd n,a[i]                   testfunca,b,npts          printfreturned array n         for i0 iltnpts i                      printfd n,b[i]                   printfthe size of one integer is d n,sizeofint      freea     freeb      return 0  void testfuncint c,int d,int npts      int i0      for i0 iltnpts i              d[i]c[i]10       codepre

Negative 658 pIm trying to interact with a typeunsafe C library in a typesafe way from Rust. The C interface deals with some codevoidcode pointers. Specifically, there is a codewritecode and a codereadcode function that takes such a codevoidcode pointer as parameter and does the obvious things write the given data to some place else or read from that place into the given buffer. What kind of data this is, is agreed upon earlier py bassing a certain integer value to an codeopencode functionp  precode1  float 2  int32t 4  int16t etc... codepre  pI represent an opened output stream where the user can call write on with a parameterized Rust struct like this onep  precodepub struct OutputStreamltTgt      cstream mut    implltT ValueTypegt for OutputStreamltTgt      pub fn writeampmut self, data amp[T] gt Resultlt,SomeErrorTypegt          unsafe  ...        codepre  pwhere codeValueTypecode is a trait I wrote for all the supported value types in a way that nobody else can implement it private base trait trick. So, obviously T is not mentioned anywhere within the struct. It seems this is a case for the a hrefhttpdoc.rustlang.orgstdkindsmarkerstruct.ContravariantType.html relnofollowContravariantTypea marker. But I dont really understand these type markers. Visiting the wikipedia page on variance does not help. I just dont see the connection between variance and how this applies to Rusts type parameters. And I dont really know what this kind of marker would actually prevent.p  pSo my questions are Do I need one of these markers for my codeOutputStreamcode If so, which one and why What exactly would I prevent by using it The same goes for an codeInputStreamcode which provides a codereadcode method instead of a codewritecode method.p

Negative 658 blockquote   pstrongNotestrong Be sure to locally cache a copy of the APIs youre using. Doing   so saves a roundtrip to Google servers on every run.

Ive looked at the a hrefhttpsgithub.comgooglegoogleapirubyclientsamples relnofollowsample codea theyve provided but I dont see how this is done.

Negative 658 pIm using a PageViewController to swipe through a series of daily ViewControllers for a week.p  pThe UIViewController that contains the pageViewController contains a few navigation items that do not scroll with the pageViewController.  These stay stationary as you swipe.  One of these items is a UIImageView, more specifically a UIButton with an UIImageView image representation.p  pThe trouble Im having is that this stationary UIImageView has a thin white border to it when it should not.  Im giving it a rounded appearance by using rounded corners that are the size of the image.  It is easiest seen in this photo.  Note, the white halo is not part of the image, it appears for any image. The borderColor, imageBackground, view background, and parent view backgrounds are all clearColor.  The red background below is part of the swipeable viewController.  Interestingly, the white border only appears when it is stationary.  If the imagebutton is placed in the swipeable View it looks great.p  pAny thoughts how I can get rid of this white antialiasingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2fCAp.png altenter image description herep

Negative 658 pI have successfully got RegFree COM working using C and C using manifest files i.e. early binding.  I am now trying to get this working using late binding.  The technique I have found, after much web searching, appears to be using Microsoft.Windows.ActCtx.p  pAn example I used to test this was MSs RegistrationFree Activation of COMBased Components found at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms973913.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms973913.aspxa to generate the SideBySide example.

So it appears to partially work.  Ive also copied wScript.exe to the local directory to rule out directory issues for running application and manifest files.p  pIve read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions979567microsoftwindowsactctxonwindowsxpMicrosoft.Windows.ActCtx on Windows Xpa and have included the prodID in the manifest but it still fails.  The manifest files work correctly with C and C examples.p  pI cant help feeling that the Microsoft.Windows.ActCtx has issues.  Documentation on this is very limited.  Any help on using manifest files with Python or VBScript would be very much appreciated.  I would be interested to know if anyone has got Microsoft.Windows.ActCtx to work.p

Negative 658 pHey guys I got a sidebar menu that looks like this. p  ol liProduct ol start2 liCategory ol start3 liArticleli olli olli liProductli ol  petcp  pI have an event listener set up to showhide the submenu when you click on the main Products. But the script also take the children with it. So If I click a product the menu will show, but if I then click on a category or article the menu will hide right before taking me to the right page. This is my code atm p  pI kinda know that this solution isnt the best, and will require a fix for older browsers. I guess I have to deal with that later. p  precode    var classname  document.getElementsByClassNamemenuitemobjectcustom  forvar i0iltclassname.lengthi     classname[i].addEventListenerclick, myFunction, false   function myFunctionevent       if this.childNodes[2].style.display    this.childNodes[2].style.display  none            var test  this.childNodes[2]         test.style.cssText  displayblock          this.childNodes[0].className  special              else          var test  this.childNodes[2]         test.style.cssText  displaynone           this.childNodes[0].className         codepre  pI just want the script to affect the Parentlink, any tips are appreciated.

Negative 658 pI had to do an assignment which had the question, Mexicos population is 62 million and is growing at the annual rate of 7. The United States current population is 280 million and is growing at the annual rate of 2. If these two countries were to maintain their current rates of growth, in how many years will Mexicos population be more than half that of the United States Your program should answer this question. So I created the basic layout, but had problems with the multiplication of the population. Finally, I found the program online and it works, but I still do not understand why do we multiply usa with 1.02 and mexico with 1.07. I know it probably is some formula, but could you guys tell me what it isp  precodedouble mexico  62000000 double usa  280000000 double years  0    while mexico lt usa2      years     mexico  1.07     usa  1.02          System.out.println Mexicos population will surpass half of USA s population in        years   years codepre

Negative 658 pIm hoping someone can shed some light on this for me as I am a bit confused as to the why of it all.  I am using a WebView in my application but I am finding that it is not always correctly syncing my cookies.  I have looked at multiple code examples for the CookieSyncManager and they all say to call CookieSyncManager.getInstance.stopSync from within onResume.  My question is, if my application is being resumed why would I want to stop syncing cookies  Shouldnt I be calling CookieSyncManager.getInstance.stopSync in onPause since my application is losing focus and there wont be anything to sync Am I just not understanding the way this works properlyp  pHere is one of the code examples Im speaking of.  It seems like most other examples I see use the same or similar code.p  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwebkitCookieSyncManager.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwebkitCookieSyncManager.htmlap

Negative 658 pIs there any construct that allows all classes which implemented a set of functions to be considered as a certain interface, even when the classes themselves do not explicitly implement the interface p  pTo make the question clearer, Ill make an example. Suppose we want to implement codeLinearSearchcode, which look through the whole array and search for certain key, and return the index of the key upon discovery. Essentially, the psudeocode might look something like thisp  precodeLinearSearchA, key     for k  0 k lt A.length k         if A.getk  key             return k     return NULL codepre  pIn that case, any classes which implemented codelengthcode and codegetcode will be able to search through the structure. We could implement this on codeDynamicArraycode, which acts the same as codeArrayListcode in Java. We could implement this on a codeLinkedListcode, ignoring the fact the codegetcode takes linear time per query. Similarly for other structures that implement these 2 functions. However, such classes might not have explicitly implemented a common interface, even though it is favorable to have them being in one.p  pWhile writing this question, I feel a sense of insecurity tinkering within me about such a construct, but I cannot put it into words. So, is there any reason you think that this might not be a good construct in actual languagesp
Negative 658 pIm currently working on a onepage website on my local machine.  I have 4 columns, each has an image, text and a button. I want the lightbox popup to appear after either the image is clicked or the button is clicked.  p  pI know that prettyPhoto works because another section of the page uses it and it works fine.   However, in this particular section, after I click on the image or the button, nothing happens.

Negative 658 pThis is an issue Ive had using the HighCharts draggable points library which I think is superb by they way.p  pWhen I make a point draggable in both the X and Y directions, strongit seems to jump to the left when I click on it for the first timestrong to begin dragging.p  pThe bug is fairly simple to reproduce, using the example at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethighchartsAyUbx relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nethighchartsAyUbxa.p  pI changed the code for series 3 to include dragging in the X direction as followsp  blockquote precode   draggableX true,     draggableY true codepre blockquote  pI hope I did that correctly. It seems to work fine, points are now draggable in both directions, but the only issue is that when I first start dragging a point it jumps to the left.p  pI believe this is something to do with the click or mousedown event firing, because the same thing happens when you simply click on a point. You dont have to try to drag it, when the code is changed to the above, simply clicking on a point will cause it to move left. This can be done repeatedly, clicking on points repeatedly and seeing them jump left again and again.p  pIve seen posts regarding jumping Draggable elements in jQuery and another on conflicts between click and drag events, here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26861680highchartsdraggablepointsconflictbetweendragandclickhighcharts draggablepoints conflict between drag and clicka, but Im afraid I dont understand these libraries well enough understand whats going on. Since this might be a bug, or might be me being stupid, I thought it best to ask here.p  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp  pEDITp  pI first had the issue in Chromium Version 34.0.1847.116 Ubuntu 13.10 260972. Ive just tried it in Windows, Chrome, 39.0.2171.65 m, and the same thing happened. Also in Firefox 30.0 and the same thing happens. As soon as you click on a point, it jumps left. If you keep clicking on points, they keep jumping left across the page. What version of Chrome are you usingp  pMany thanksp  pSOLVEDp  pThis problem does strongnotstrong occur when I use the downloaded version of Highcharts draggablepoints on my own machine.

Negative 658 pIm looking for some advice on best practices here.  I have a SAML framework built into my application.  Typically what Ive done to test it is have two instances of Visual Studio running, each on a different port and then make calls from localhost50000 to localhost330000 or whatever port number it is.p  pThe issue with this is that I cant test with HTTPS and real certificates that require it.  The advice that Im looking for here is how other people have tackled this in the past.  p  pIf I want to test with HTTPS, my thinking is Id have to set up an IIS websites and use those with each other.  If I wanted to test in with an outside vendor, Id have to open up a port in our firewall, and point it to my computer.  p  pIs this the best way to go about doing this  Im not sure it is, so I wanted to ask the question.p

Negative 658 pI am working on a Python 3 API that interfaces with a web service.

What can I do Can I contact Google somehow, so they stop the queryp  pIve been working on a project for a company which analyzes Google Analytics data with BigQuery, so I dont want to run them a big bill or something. Maybe StackOverflow is not the right place to ask this question, but Ive tried to find another place, and I couldnt. On the BigQuery support page, it is said that questions should be asked here, with the googlebigquery tag, so Im doing that.p  pIve written a query which I dont want to paste or describe here, as someone might abuse it to block BigQuery or something, I dont know. Lets just say it includes inner joins. After Ive written it, and before running it, the console message was something like This will analyze 674KB of data, which looked OK, given the fact that the table only has 10,000 rows. Ive got the same message after clicking on abandon query, something like You can abandon this, but you will still be billed for 674KB of data.p  pI try very hard to make sure what I do doesnt cause problems to someone, so Ive actually run that query on a local PostgreSQL database with the exact same data  10,000 rows as in BigQuery, and the query there finishes in a second or two.p  pHow can I cancel this query, and can I the company Ive worked for be billed for something more than 674KB of datap

Negative 658 pIm evaluating TFS Build 2013 for use in a corporate environment. TFs itself has been running fine for ages, and today I setup the Build components. No problem so far.p  pI grabbed a fairly simple project from source and created a manually triggered build definition, using the standard defaults.p  pI ran a test build and hit an issue straight away with a primary reference. The error in the logs is p  blockquote   pCProgram Files x86MSBuild12.0binamd64Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets1697,5 warning MSB3245 Could not resolve this reference. Could not locate the assembly XYZ.dll.p blockquote  pSo a bit of back of background on how we store and use references We create a root folder for the solution, inside this goes the .sln file and sub directories for the projects as normal. We then add a References folder at this level, which holds all of the DLLs required for the project. These are generally DLLs from other in house code libraries, but also certain 3rd party ones such as the old Enterprise Library DLLs, and anything else we dont get from NuGet.p  pEach of the projects that require these DLLs reference this folder and from inspecting the .proj files I can see the link is stored as ..ReferencesXYZ.dll etc. This works fine for local builds and nobody has ever had an issue. The reference folder gets checked into TFS and everybody gets a copy. From what Ive read through trying to diagnose our issue, this is a fairly common and accepted way to manage references.p  pSo, the build error that I receive is as above. Basically saying the build target cant find the DLL from the References folder. The log goes on to list all of the places its tried to find it.p  pCrucially it would seem the first line readsp  blockquote   pFor SearchPath HintPathFromItem.                    Considered ..ReferencesXYZ.dll, but it didnt exist.p blockquote  pFurthermore it looks in the Framework folder, various default assembly folders, the GAC and so on, none of which of course contains it.p  pSo Im wondering where Ive gone wrong. Have I misconfigured one of the builddrop locations Is there some other convention for referencing required DLLs bearing in mind our entire company uses the ..References folder setup, or is there something elsep  pIm fairly new to TFS Build, but Im by no means new to TFS or Visual Studio  itself. Ive spent about an hour or so Googling without finding anyone experiencing the same issue as me, so any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe build agent is configured as followsp  pBuild Agent working directoryp  blockquote   pDBuildAgentBuildAgentIdBuildDefinitionPathp blockquote  pThe build definition Source Settings have the I assume default values ofp  blockquote   pStatus Active  Source Control Folder ProjectRoot  Build Agent Folder SourceDirp      pStatus Cloaked  Source Control Folder ProjectRootDrops  Build Agent Folder p blockquote  pThe references folder is not explicitly configured here, but when I look in the Build Agents working directory I can see itp  blockquote   pDBuildAgent1ClientNameSolutionNamesrcDevEvolutionSourceSolutionName.SolutionReferencesp blockquote  pIf I open VS2013 Command Prompt, navigate to the folder that contains the .sln file and also the References folder and run msbuild dpathtoSolution.sln then it builds successfully with no warnings or errors.p

Negative 658 pI am using this codep  precodemLastLocation  LocationServices.FusedLocationApi.getLastLocation             mGoogleApiClient codepre  pto get the last Location of the user. If I enable the location services in Android, it works fine, but if I disable them, the LocationApi delivers null. The Google Documantation says, the Api delivers normaly an Object, and just in some rare cases, the Object can be null. But it is null, as soon as the User disables the Location Service in Android. This is more the standard than the rare case. I thought it would at least give me the last known location which was saved anywhere, or a location with really low precission.  Am I doing anything wrong Is there a way to get the location anytime I need it  the precission is not important, as long as it is not far away  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 658 pIve an embedded system which runs firmware and has USB mass storage with size 79kB. So when you plug in the device to any computerMACWindows, it pops as a 79kB flash drive. The firmware creates files which has transaction records. The objective is to display these transactions tables and simple graphs to the user. Ive narrowed down to a web browser. So the user with MACWindows PC can plug in the USB device mass storage and open an HTML file in the mass storage drive and view all the transactions in the form of tables and simple bar graphs. The tricky part comes here the devicefirmware needs to update its clock, and this time input has to be sourced from the MACWindows PC. How can this be achievedp  pThis is the minimum requirement. Further, through the web browser the user wants to write some configuration parameters for e.g. through a text box and a submit button in the HTML page. NOTE Here the device has USB mass storage type and the web browser approach were selected so that there is no prerequisites for the user. p  pPlease suggest an alternative if this can be done using another approach for e.g. a different class of USB or some other application locally available on MACWindows desktoplaptop. For e.g. the application should run on both on Mac and Windows i.e. the code should be the same but can be built into separate packages one for Mac and the other .exe for Windows. Please suggest a platform for this that has same source but can be built for both mac and windows. Thanksp

Heres the content of my .htaccess.p  pCan anyone help me figure out a solutionp  hr  precode Use the front controller as index file. It serves as a fallback solution when  every other rewriteredirect fails e.g. in an aliased environment without  modrewrite. Additionally, this reduces the matching process for the  start page path  because otherwise Apache will apply the rewriting rules  to each configured DirectoryIndex file e.g. index.php, index.html, index.pl. DirectoryIndex index.php  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt     RewriteEngine On       Rewrite double leading slash routes to single leading slash routes     RewriteRule api. api1 [L]       Determine the RewriteBase automatically and set it as environment variable.      If you are using Apache aliases to do mass virtual hosting or installed the      project in a subdirectory, the base path will be prepended to allow proper      resolution of the app.php file and to redirect to the correct URI. It will      work in environments without path prefix as well, providing a safe, onesize      fits all solution. But as you do not need it in this case, you can comment      the following 2 lines to eliminate the overhead.     RewriteCond REQUESTURI1 ..2     RewriteRule .  [EBASE1]       Sets the HTTPAUTHORIZATION header removed by apache     RewriteCond HTTPAuthorization .     RewriteRule .  [EHTTPAUTHORIZATIONHTTPAuthorization]       Redirect to URI without front controller to prevent duplicate content      with and without app.php. Only do this redirect on the initial      rewrite by Apache and not on subsequent cycles. Otherwise we would get an      endless redirect loop request gt rewrite to front controller gt      redirect gt request gt ....      So in case you get a too many redirects error or you always get redirected      to the start page because your Apache does not expose the REDIRECTSTATUS      environment variable, you have 2 choices       disable this feature by commenting the following 2 lines or       use Apache gt 2.3.9 and replace all L flags by END flags and remove the        following RewriteCond best solution     RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS      RewriteRule index.php. ENVBASE2 [R301,L]       If the requested filename exists, simply serve it.      We only want to let Apache serve files and not directories.     RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f     RewriteRule .  [L]       Rewrite all other queries to the front controller.     RewriteRule . ENVBASEindex.php [L] ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt     ltIfModule modalias.cgt          When modrewrite is not available, we instruct a temporary redirect of          the start page to the front controller explicitly so that the website          and the generated links can still be used.         RedirectMatch 302  index.php          RedirectTemp cannot be used instead     ltIfModulegt ltIfModulegt codepre

I currently manually handle redirects to the users local IDP, so have tried to turn this off for the new client.p

Negative 658 pFor those who remember or still use Windows XP, you might remember that you could launch the start bar with your Windows key on your keyboard and then hit the letter of the programfolderfile you wanted and as long as there wasnt another programfolderfile on the start bar starting with the same letter, itd launch right away. e.g. If you wanted to open excel, youd hit the windows key and press the letter e and excel would launch.p  pSo, for those who do remember that feature, Im wondering, is there any way to get that functionality back in Windows 8.1 Right now, what happens is that when you hit the windows key, Metro pops up which is fine but if you type e, for example, windows will automatically start searching instead of just launching Excel or whatever letter youve typed.p  pId rather keep the interface as it is and, if possible, prefer not to install any 3rd party software unless theres no other go. My preference is to be able to utilize the OS to get that option if available, even if that includes going through regedit. p  pJust a note, I am already aware that 8.1 and XP are completely different architectures and I also realize that automatic searching does have its benefits but I prefer that specific XP functionality so itd be great if I could get it back in 8.1.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p  hr

Negative 658 pHelp me in understanding differences between these two. as per to me, Operation ContextScope can be used irrespective of .NET application you are using like WCF, Console, Web, etc, anywhere this can be used if you are calling any other service like WCF or Java based service [ it this will not work in case of ASMX service] to add headers into outgoing message.p  pIf so then why we need MessageInspectors at any client side to add headers OperationContextScope is much simpler than MessageInspectors. anybody shed some light to understand the correct usage of these twop
Negative 658 pBasically Im trying to show an animation on certain elements that were affected in a most recent action. After this animation completes it shouldnt play again. The problem I have at the moment is that I also define an animation which runs when the elements are selected. When the element is deselected the original animation plays again, even if the codeanimationiterationcountcode of 1 has been reached. I could certainly set up an event listener for when codeanimationendcode fires and then remove the class associated with the animation. Im more trying to reason about why this doesnt work as intended.

Negative 658 pI am trying to setup IIS Client Certificate Mapping Authentication and so far I have been unsuccessful. p  ol liI have a valid client authentication certificate li liI disabled all authentication methods in the Authentication feature of IIS for the target websiteli liUsing the configuration editor I setup iisClientCertificateMappingAuthentication as documented in various sources. In this series of screen we map a domain account to a certificate. This is done by exporting the certificate to a text file, removing the first and last line and making sure all is in one line.li ol  pThe problem is as followsp  pWhen I try browsing to a test page, browser correctly prompts for selection of a certificate. I select the correct certificate. I then get presented with p  pHTTP Error 401.2  Unauthorized You are not authorized to view this page due to invalid authentication headers.p  pIf I enable Anonymous Authentication then it works, but the user is not the one in the mapping it is the user running the browser. I know this because the test page contains the followingp  presponse.write request.servervariablesLOGONUSER response.write request.servervariablesAUTHUSERp  pSo the questions arep  ol liFor IIS Client Certificate Mapping Authentication, is this the only authentication feature that needs to be enabledli liDo we need to use the Authorisation feature to limit the users to the one provided in the mapping li ol  pWhat I am trying to achieve is that only clients that have the certificate will be able to access the service. p  pWhat am I missingp  pCheersp  pJosep
