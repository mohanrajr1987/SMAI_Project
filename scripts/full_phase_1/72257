Negative 72257 pI use Thunderbird to receive email using POP3.  I have Thurnderbird configured to leave email on the server.  Lets say one day I uses POP3 to retrieve codeRETRcode 10 email messages, then I logout for the night.  Overnight 10 more messages are sent to my mailbox.  When I fire up Thunderbird the next morning, the codeSTATcode command should show 20 messages.  However, Thunderbird should not download the first 10 messages it should start at message 11 or the unique identifier or UID for message 11.  Thunderbird will send a POP3 codeUIDLcode command, then compare the UIDs to the UID of the last message Thunderbird retrieved yesterday.  It will find that the last UID matches the UIDL list for message 10, then Thunderbird will codeRETR 11code, codeRETR 12code, and so on.p  pIn my case, the POP3 codeSTATcode command shows that I have 5379 messages on the POP server.  I have already received about 5000 of them.  For some reason Thunderbird wants to download all 5379 messages instead of starting at 5001.  I am trying to debug this and was looking for the UID that Thunderbird thinks was the last message retrieved.p  pDoes anyone know where Thunderbird on Windows stores the last UID, which it will use to compare to the UIDL listp  pIs there a way to manually set it so I can force Thunderbird to start retrieving somewhere close to 5001p

Negative 72257 pI know this has been discussed many times, but I am not sure I really understand emwhyem Java and C designers chose to omit this feature from these languages. I am not interested in how I can make workarounds using interfaces, cloning, or any other alternative, but rather in the rationale behind the decision.p  pemFrom a language design perspective, why has this feature been declinedemp  pP.S Im using words such as omitted, which some people may find inadequate, as C was designed in an additive rather than subtractive approach. However, I am using such words because the feature existed in C before these languages were designed, so it is omitted in the sense of being removed from a programmers toolbox.p

Negative 72257 pI have received this database full of people names and data in French, which means, using characters such as ,,,, etc. Around 3000 entries.p  pApparently, the data inside has been encoded sometimes using utf8encode, and sometimes not.

So i need to clean the database, converting all misencoded data by its cleaned up version.p  pQuestion  would it be possible to create a function in php that would check if a utf8 string is correctly encoded without utf8encode or not with utf8encode, and, if it was, convert it back to its original statep  pIn other terms i would like to know how i could detect utf8 content that has been utf8encode  to utf8 content that has not been utf8encoded. p  pUPDATE EXAMPLE p  pHere is a good example you take a string full of special chars and take a copy of that string and utf8encode it.

Negative 72257 pIm new to iPhone dev and programming in general, having recently completed Stephen Kochans Programming in ObjectiveC 2.0, and parts of Erica Saduns iPhone Cookbook. Just reading answered questions on this site has helped me a lot, so I owe a big thanks to all its users. Now Im working on my first iPhone app, and am making good progress, save for one thing thats got me stumped. p  pIm having some trouble with a UITableView. Basically, I have a table that needs to have a maximum of 6 rows per section, with no minimum except if the row of a 1row section is deleted, in which case the section goes along with it. The table can also be reordered by the user. When the user drags a row into a section that already has the maximum 6 allotted rows, I want the bottom row of that section to sortof budge down to become the top row of the next section. p  pAs for implementing this, my first thought was to call a method in codetableViewmoveRowAtIndexPathtoIndexPathcode that would go through the sections in a loop, making sure that none of them had 7 rows, adjusting the array as needed, and then using a code[myTable beginUpdates]code block to delete and insert the required rows. This is what all that looks like note my array structure is Array Table  Arrays Sections  Dictionaries Itemsp  precodevoid tableView UITableView  tableView moveRowAtIndexPath NSIndexPath  from toIndexPath NSIndexPath  to    Get the dictionary object for the icon.

As for what those tweaks are, Ive also tried using codereloadSectionswithRowAnimationcode, and of course a simple code[editTable reloadData]code. Ive tried placing the call to this method in the relevant TableView delegatedata source methods, including codetargetIndexPathForMoveFromRowAtIndexPathtoProposedIndexPathcode, and the somewhat mysterious codewillMoveToRowAtIndexPathfromIndexPathcode method that is mentioned in the Apple guide on TableViews, but is nonexistent elsewhere.p  pIve searched all over the Google, this site, and Apples docs for any inkling of a solution, but to no avail.p  pSo, to put my question simply, what is the best way to go about this Is there some obvious thing that Im overlooking Or is my implementation concept just fundamentally flawed from the getgo p  pThanks in advance for the help Any insight would be much appreciated.p  p Drew R.

Negative 72257 pHey everyone reading this,p  pIve recently got into doing GUI development with Python. Tkinter seems like the easiest and most logical choice starting out. I did a little with wxPython but it was more sophisticated than what I needed.p  pAnyway, Im developing a media player. Right now its a simple window with a button to load .wav files. The problem is I would like to implement a pause button now. But, when playing a audio file the GUI isnt accessible again no buttons can be pushed till the file is done playing. How can I make the GUI dynamic while an audio file is playing p  pI was thinking this maybe be because Im using PyAudio, and their implementation doesnt allow this.

Negative 72257 pI am designing a social network and wanted to know if I am on the right track. I have Notifications, Requests and Live feeds on the site. Similar to what we see on most sites nowadays. To design these, I assume these are NOT separate components rather they all flow out from the same Activity component p  pSystem has a set of say 200 activities possible involving 30 objects. 40 activities may have notifications, 70 may have feeds, 10 may have requests. So I assume these will be part of the activity look up table that is  does the activity have a Feed, Notification, Request as Boolean columns. If yes, then the default text to display for all 3 Feed, Notification, Request to the user like NAME commented on  photo. Another column will be FK to the object look up table to match objects with activities.p  pSo basically I am unsure if these should all be part of the activity look up table only or is there some other design to considerp  pOne possible use case is like notifications  the system may have 40 available but the user may only optin to 10 of those. So there will be a separate user settings table to hold user defined preferences.p

They both are expecting WCF calls via Receive activities in the workflow.p  pWhen I start the 2 Application Pools, I can see 2 w3wp.exe worker processes running, one as emUserAem and the other as emUserBem. I expect that w3wp.exe worker process for emUserAem should handle WCF requests for emWFSAem, and w3wp.exe worker process for emUserBem should handle WCF requests for emWFSBem.p  pHowever, when I start sending WCF messages to the workflows, I can see through the trace log files that both w3wp.exe processes are handling requests for both Workflow Services. p  pFor example, WCF messages for emWFSAem are being handle by the w3wp.exe worker processes for emUserAem AND emUserBem. So if I send 10 WCF messages to emWFSAem, 4 would be handled by w3wp.exe for emUserAem, and 6 would be handled by w3wp.exe for emUserBem.p  pWhen I switch the Application Pool to Classic Managed Pipeline Mode, the WCF messages are routed to the respective worker processes, as expected.p  pIs there some configuration that Im missing p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIn the project Im working on, emWFSAem, emWFSBem, and another WCF Service Application emWCFAppem communicate with each other in the following configurationp  pemWFSAem lt emWFSBem lt emWCFAppemp  pWe see problems in the following scenariop  ul liemWFSAem  emWFSBem emUserAem emWFSAem instantiates a new workflow on emWFSBem, which is processed on w3wp.exe for emUserAem.li liemWFSBem emUserAem  emWCFAppem emWFSBem calls the emWCFAppem, which does some processing. li liemWCFAppem  emWFSBem emUserBem After processing, emWCFAppem notifies emWFSBem that its done.

Negative 72257 pIn a plugin system I instantiate objects and call methods of those objects based on some incoming requests which have some identifier simply a string. With the help of a configuration this identifier determines which assembly to load, which class in this assembly to instantiate and which method to call. The assemblies are loaded into a separate AppDomain. This happens in a proxy class which is created like sop  precodesecondDomain.CreateInstanceFromAndUnwrapAssembly.GetExecutingAssembly.CodeBase,     typeofSecondDomainProxy.FullName as SecondDamainProxy codepre  pIn the class SecondDomainProxy I load the assembly which is related to the codeidentifiercode mentioned abovep  precodestring assemblyFileName  GetAssemblyFileNameFromConfigidentifier Assembly assembly  Assembly.LoadFromassemblyFileName  Instantiate and run something in assembly codepre  pQuestion Does it make sense to hold a reference to this Assembly object once the assembly has been loaded For instance with a Dictionary...p  precodeDictionaryltstring, Assemblygt assemblyDict codepre  p... and by changing the code above top  precodeAssembly assembly if assemblyDict.TryGetValueidentifier, out assembly      string assemblyFileName  GetAssemblyFileNameFromConfigidentifier     assembly  Assembly.LoadFromassemblyFileName     assemblyDict[identifier]  assembly   Instantiate and run something in assembly codepre  pI am aware that the assembly is loaded after the first call of Assembly.LoadFrom forever until the AppDomain is unloaded. The second AppDomain lives as long as the main application in my case. So does that mean that a second call to Assembly.LoadFrom is cheap, as cheap or almost as cheap as the dictionary lookup Or does it have drawbacks NOT to call assembly.LoadFrom and to use the saved reference insteadp  pMy feeling is that it doesnt really matter unless I have high performance requirements which I dont have one request every 15 seconds roughly. But I could be wrong.p  pThank you for feedback in advancep  pstrongEditstrongp  pcodeAssemblycode is a normal .NET class. If I dont have any references to an instance of this class it gets garbage collected, I think. But the assembly itself keeps still loaded. So codeAssembly.LoadFromcode needs at least to create a new instance of the Assembly class, although at the second time this instance creation might be based on the already loaded assembly.p  pId like to add the question Does creating an assembly object for a given assembly require some heavy reflection and is therefore always expensive, no matter if the assembly is loaded or notp

Negative 72257 pIm building a scene with Core Animation which looks similar to the screensaver on the old Apple TV. A continuous stream of images each a codeCALayercode passes by vertically, from the bottom to top. To achieve this, after a layers animation ends when it moves out of view, it is repositioned back to the bottom, assigned a new image, and reanimated. This takes place in the codeanimationDidStopcode delegate method. However, Ive noticed that if I take a screenshot when running the app on an iPad, the layers are never repositioned to the bottom, and arent seen again. Ive isolated the problem, and Im certain that taking screenshots is causing it. This leads me to think that taking a screenshot has an effect on animation timing. So...p  ol liWhat impact does taking a screenshot on an iDevice have on animationli liIs there a better way to achieve this effectli ol

Negative 72257 pI am having an issue with wxPython.  A simplified version of the code is posted below white space, comments, etc removed to reduce size  but the general format to my program is kept roughly the same.  When I run the script, the static text correctly wraps as it should, but the other items in the panel do not move down they act as if the statictext is only one line and thus not everything is visible.  If I manually resize the windowframe, even just a tiny amount, everything gets corrected and displays as it is should.  I took screen shots to show this behavior, but I just created this account and thus dont have the required 10 reputation points to be allowed to post pictures.p  pWhy does it not display correctly to begin with  Ive tried all sorts of combinations of GetParent.Refresh or Update and GetTopLevelParent.Update or Refresh.

Negative 72257 pWhen programming animations and little games Ive come to know the incredible importance of codeThread.sleepncode I rely on this method to tell the operating system when my application wont need any CPU, and using this making my program progress in a predictable speed.p  pMy problem is that the JRE uses different methods of implementation of this functionality on different operating systems. On UNIXbased or influenced OSes such as Ubuntu and OS X, the underlying JRE implementation uses a wellfunctioning and precise system for distributing CPUtime to different applications, and so making my 2D game smooth and lagfree. However, on Windows 7 and older Microsoft systems, the CPUtime distribution seems to work differently, and you usually get back your CPUtime after the given amount of sleep, varying with about 12 ms from target sleep. However, you get occasional bursts of extra 1020 ms of sleep time. This causes my game to lag once every few seconds when this happens. Ive noticed this problem exists on most Java games Ive tried on Windows, Minecraft being a noticeable example.p  pNow, Ive been looking around on the Internet to find a solution to this problem. Ive seen a lot of people using only codeThread.yieldcode instead of codeThread.sleepncode, which works flawlessly at the cost of the currently used CPU core getting full load, no matter how much CPU your game actually needs. This is not ideal for playing your game on laptops or high energy consumption workstations, and its an unnecessary tradeoff on Macs and Linux systems.p  pLooking around further I found a commonly used method of correcting sleep time inconsistencies called spinsleep, where you only order sleep for 1 ms at a time and check for consistency using the codeSystem.nanoTimecode method, which is very accurate even on Microsoft systems. This helps for the normal 12 ms of sleep inconsistency, but it wont help against the occasional bursts of 1020 ms of sleep inconsistency, since this often results in more time spent than one cycle of my loop should take all together.p  pAfter tons of looking I found this cryptic article of Andy Malakov, which was very helpful in improving my loop a hrefhttpandymalakov.blogspot.com201006alternativetothreadsleep.htmlhttpandymalakov.blogspot.com201006alternativetothreadsleep.htmlap  pBased on his article I wrote this sleep methodp  precode Variables for calculating optimal sleep time.

So, since I still care about improving the accuracy of this sleep method, and Im still not satisfied with the performance, I would like to appeal to all of you java game hackers and animators out there for suggestions on a better solution for the Windows platform. Could I use a platformspecific way on Windows to make it better I dont care about having a little platform specific code in my applications, as long as the majority of the code is OS independent.p  pI would also like to know if there is anyone who knows about Microsoft and Oracle working out a better implementation of the codeThread.sleepncode method, or whats Oracles future plans are on improving their environment as the basis of applications requiring high timing accuracy, such as music software and gamesp  pThank you all for reading my lengthy questionarticle.

Negative 72257 pUPDATE I did forget to mention that this was within the ArcGIS 10 Field Calculator. I have also figured out that it may just not be something I can do within the Field Calculator. p  pInstead of within the field calculator, what changes would I need to make to my script to just create a script tool that will create an output value that I could use as input for another tool, in this case for the Expression. I think it involves gp.SetPerameterAsText, but Im not entirely sure that I understand this function or how it works, so even just an explanation of it would be great, thanks.p  hr  pI have a model that automatically formats an input table to match a certain schema. It does this by creating temporary fields to put the data into, calculating them, deleting the original fields, adding the final fields, calculating them, and then deleting the temporary fields, leaving my final fields with the proper types, lengths, and order.p  pSince the tables we use for the input come from multiple sources, they tend to be just different enough that one model cant easily apply to all of them, i.e. the field name should be Owner1 but comes back Owner, Own1, Owner1, etc. As it is, the a model allows input table names to be modified as parameters when the model is run, but this involves opening the table in another program anyway and taking as much time as it would to just manually format the table. I know, it doesnt take that long, so why would I need a model The model is just to maintain consistency and accuracy between techs.p  pWhat I need is a way for the field calculator to complete the expression [Field] with a variable field name from a table, recognizing the result as a field. I dont know if thats even possible to tell the truth, but hopefully it is.p  pThis is what Ive got so farp  precodeimport arcgisscripting gp  arcgisscripting.create9.3  fc  rShapefileTable Sets shapefile name based on input table using Parse Path tool.  sFields  gp.Listfieldsfc  for field in sFields    if field.NAME  Field1       SubField  [Field1]    elif field.NAME  Field2       SubField  [Field2] codepre  pThe expression box then calls on SubField. The problem Im having is that even after I define SubField as a function, it only sets my expression equal to [Field1] or [Field2] as a string, so that I then either get a field full of junk, or an error saying the data type doesnt match the field type some of my fields are date or number.p  pIs there a way for me to conditionally complete the expression based on recognition of a field name from a set number of acceptable variations of field names from an input table I cant help but feel like Im just missing something really obvious here. The way I understand the use of the Field Calculator, this may just be beyond the calculators capability or purpose, but Im not certain. If that is the case, would anyone know of an alternative method I know this is a lot to read, so thanks again for any help you can provide.p

Negative 72257 pIm currently working on a location page on a website and am having trouble with a showhide jquery effect. The jQuery below activates onclick and applies toggles the class of a div to showhide it... pretty straightforward. However, when I add more divs with the same class and click on the activator link, it runs the functions on all of the divs. I know this is a simple fix, but I cant figure out the right syntax. Could anyone take a quick look at this code and see about how I could fix it. I only included one of the html divs below. Its when I have more than one that causes the problem.

Negative 72257 pI am trying to understand the concept of document storage and fail to see how it would apply to some situations.  For example, in the case of a CMSblog engine there may be data in the form ofp  ul liPostsli liCategories li liUsers li liCommentsli ul  pIn something such as MySQL one might have a table for each, then a join table for each set of related data.  i.e. codepoststablecode, codecategoriestablecode, codecategoriespoststablecode p  pIn this case, codepoststablecode would contain the post data, codecategoriestablecode would contain the categories data and codecategoriespoststablecode would contain 2 foreign keys used to associate a specific category to a specific post.p  pHow does this translate into something like mongodb  p  pThe only way i can see this setup being structured in mongo is something likep  ul lipostscollectionli ul  pThe output of a single bson document might look similar top  precode        title  title,      body  blah body,      categories  [                  category1,                  category2                ]    codepre  pThat makes sense, but it seems like categories are going to be duplicated all over the place.  With out some sort of relation, you could never be able to simply change the category name and have it reflected across all of your blog posts .  p  pAdditionally what if these were like binary documents that took up a lot of space  Instead of duplicating the same image over and over it seems like a relationship would work betterp  pI guess this is a pretty open question, but i was looking for anyones input on how i should mentally take apart a problem to tell if it should fit in a db like mongo or not.  And equally important is how does one structure data correctly  p  pI have not touched on Users but it seems like EVERYTHING in this would ultimately end up as an embedded document inside of a Users collection since the User kind of starts everything.p  pthanks a  lot.p
Negative 72257 pI have some doubts about how Reddit and Hacker News manage to store such amount of news and comments while keeping all their rankings updated.

Negative 72257 pIve done a lot of Googling, but havent found anything, so Im really sorry if Im just searching for the wrong things.p  pI am writing an implementation of the a hrefhttpssecure.wikimedia.orgwikipediaenwikiGhost28game29 relnofollowGhosta for a hrefhttpocw.mit.educourseselectricalengineeringandcomputerscience600introductiontocomputerscienceandprogrammingfall2008assignments relnofollowMIT Introduction to Programming, assignment 5a.p  pAs part of this, I need to determine whether a string of characters is the start of any valid word. I have a list of valid words wordlist.p  pUpdate I could use something that iterated through the list each time, such as Peters simple suggestionp  precodedef wordexistswordlist, wordfragment return anyw.startswithwordfragment for w in wordlist codepre  pI previously hadp  precodewordlist  [w for w in wordlist if w.startswithwordfragment] codepre  pfrom a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4822840pythonalgorithmforthegameghostneedawaytointelligentlylookupallherea to narrow the list down to the list of valid words that start with that fragment and consider it a loss if wordlist is empty. The reason that I took this approach was that I incorrectly, see below thought that this would save time, as subsequent lookups would only have to search a smaller list. p  pIt occurred to me that this is going through each item in the original wordlist 38,000odd words checking the start of each. This seems silly when wordlist is ordered, and the comprehension could stop once it hits something that is after the word fragment. I tried thisp  precodenewlist  [] for w in wordlist     if w[lenwordfragment] gt wordfragment          Take advantage of the fact that the list is sorted         break     if w.startswithwordfragment         newlist.appendw return newlist codepre  pbut that is about the same speed, which I thought may be because list comprehensions run as compiled codep  pI then thought that more efficient again would be some form of binary search in the list to find the block of matching words. Is this the way to go, or am I missing something really obviousp  pClearly it isnt really a big deal in this case, but Im just starting out with programming and want to do things properly.p  h2UPDATEh2  pI have since tested the below suggestions with a a hrefhttppastebin.comsCd4424k relnofollowsimple test scripta. While Peters binary searchbisect would clearly be better for a single run, I was interested in whether the narrowing list would win over a series of fragments. In fact, it did notp  precodeThe totals for all strings p, py, pyt, pyth, pytho are as follows In total, Peters simple test took 0.175472736359 In total, Peters bisect left test took 9.36985015869e05 In total, the list comprehension took 0.0499348640442 In total, Neil Gs bisect took 0.000373601913452 codepre  pThe overhead of creating a second list etc clearly took more time than searching the longer list. In hindsight, this was likely the best approach regardless, as the reducing list approach emincreasedem the time for the first run, which was the worst case scenario. p  pThanks all for some excellent suggestions, and well done Peter for the best answerp

Negative 72257 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6742923ifstringsareimmutableinnetthenwhydoessubstringtakeontimethis popular question about why substring takes On in Ca, one of the main answers provided argued that if a large array were allocated and substrings computed by having the new strings just reference a small slice of the array, the garbage collector would not be able to reclaim the array of characters containing the larger string even if the original string were no longer being referenced.p  pThis seems like a perfectly valid answer, but it seems like in theory one could construct a garbage collector for arrays that allowed for most of an array to be garbage collected while leaving behind some small subarray thats still in use.  In other words, if there were a 50,000element array of which only a small 100element slice was still in use, the garbage collector could split the array into three pieces  the elements before the 100element slice, the 100element slice itself, and the elements after the 100element slice  and then garbage collect the first and last of these pieces.p  pMy question is whether any language implementations actually use this sort of garbage collector, or whether it exists only in theory.  Does anyone know of an example of a language implementation that has an garbage collector like thisp

Negative 72257 pI ran some tests using the codeGetSystemTimeAdjustmentcode function on Windows 7, and got some interesting results which I cannot explain.

Negative 72257 pI have a script Im writing to batch download images from an imageboard via JSONXML api. Previously, it had been purely CLI, but recently Ive been trying to build a UI in PyQt, with great success but for one problem thread blocking issues, nonresponsive GUI when actually calling the worker threads within my script. So, Im trying to switch from threading.Thread to QThread, to make it easier to manage by emitting a threadFinished SIGNAL to update my GUI, but I cant seem to get it set up properly.

Negative 72257 pIts my first specific question here on stackoverflow, cause I couldnt found any helpful solutions for my problem yet. I need a low level socket connection between my iPhone and OSX Workstation as TCP Server, to interchange some media data like pictures or audio files.

Negative 72257 pIve been stuck on this one for a while and any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Ive created a singleton object called SharedUser that represents the user who is currently using the app.  This SharedUser object has two NSStrings for username and userId and an NSArray for the company departments to which the user belongs.  The user is initialized upon login with a method called initWithUsername.  Inside this method the username is used to parse the user and get the users unique id number and the the users departments.p  pMy problem is as follows when I get the user through the sharedUser method at a later point in the app, the userId string is empty and causes an excbadaccess error when I try to use it.  I know that the userId string is being initialized though because I have observed this happening in the debugger.  However, strangely enough, the username string still exists for the same object that is lacking the userId string.  Im very confused as to how the memory behind userId could be released while username would still hang around.  p  pMy SharedUser class looks like thisp  precodeimplementation SharedUser synthesize userId synthesize username synthesize departmentIds  static SharedUser sharedUser  nil  SharedUser sharedUser   synchronizedself          if sharedUser              sharedUser[[self alloc] init]                   return sharedUser    idallocWithZoneNSZone zone      synchronizedself          if sharedUser  nil               sharedUser  [super allocWithZonezone]              return sharedUser                    return nil    idcopyWithZoneNSZone zone      return self     idretain      return self     unsignedretainCount      return NSUIntegerMax     oneway voidrelease       never release     idautorelease      do nothing     id init      synchronizedself          [super init]         username           userId           departmentIds  nil         return self          void initWithUserNameNSString  loginName       username  loginName      create a request and a connection         NSURL url  [NSURL URLWithStringhttpblah.comurlforthejson]        ASIHTTPRequest request  [ASIHTTPRequest requestWithURLurl]     [request startSynchronous]     NSError error  [request error]      if error           NSString responseString  [request responseString]         NSArray listOfPeopleDictionaries  [responseString JSONValue]          for NSDictionary personDictionary in listOfPeopleDictionaries               if [loginName isEqualToString[personDictionary  objectForKeyusername]]                   Set the user id                 userId  [personDictionary objectForKeyid]                   Set the users department                 NSArray departmentsArray  [personDictionary objectForKeyorganizations]                 for NSDictionary department in departmentsArray                      [departmentIds addObject[department objectForKeyid]]                                                     else          give error           voiddealloc       Should never be called     [username release]     [userId release]     [departmentIds release]     [super dealloc]  codepre  pThe following code would cause an excbadaccess error on the third line.p  precodeSharedUser user  [SharedUser sharedUser] NSLog, user.username NSLog, user.userId codepre  pThat said, my question is where is the memory behind the userId string being released and what do I do to fix it  Im brand new to stack overflow so please be gentle.p

Negative 72257 pIm new to multithreaded programming, and have a question. How do I get each thread to iterate through all the elements in a list being added to by a different thread p  pHeres a simple program to demonstrate.  I have a single list of integers, and 10 threads, numbered 1 through 10, that are working on it.  Each thread is to write all the values in the list to a StringBuilder.  After a thread writes all the values in the list, it adds its number to the list, then terminates.p  pIm trying to get each thread to keep checking the list for elements until the list is no longer being modified by any other thread, but am having trouble with the locking on it.  If successful, the program would have output that might look like  p  precode3 1, 8 1,3,2,4,5,7, 6 1,3,2,4,5,7,8, 9 1,3,2,4,5,7,8,6, 7 1,3,2,4,5, 10 1,3,2,4,5,7,8,6,9, 5 1,3,2,4, 4 1,3,2, 2 1,3, 1  codepre  pWhich happens sometimes, but often two or more of the threads finish before the lock is set, so the iteration ends prematurelyp  precode1  2 1,5,4,8,7,3,10, 10 1,5,4,8,7,3, 9 1,5,4,8,7,3,10,2, 3 1,5,4,8,7, 7 1,5,4,8, 5 1,    ltltone of these threads didnt wait to stop iterating.  4 1,    ltlt 8 1,5,4, 6 1,5,4,8,7,3,10,2, codepre  pDoes anyone have any ideasp  pp  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock  public class ListChecker implements Runnable  static ListltIntegergt list  new ArrayListltIntegergt static ReentrantLock lock  new ReentrantLock  int id StringBuilder result  new StringBuilder   public ListCheckerint id     this.id  id   Override public void run      int i0      do         while i lt list.size                         result.appendlist.geti.append,                     if lock.isLocked             break              while true                       addElementid     System.out.printlnid     result.toString   public void addElementint element     try         lock.lock         list.addelement       finally         lock.unlock         public static void mainString[] args     forint i1 ilt10 i         ListChecker checker  new ListCheckeri         new Threadchecker.start              codepre  hr  pEdit  Thanks for the help so far.  I should clarify, that I would like for each thread to be iterating through the list at the same time.  In my case, theres a lot of processing that needs to be performed on each element of the list by each thread instead of appending to a StringBuffer, Im doing a lot of comparisons of a candidate item to a list of finalists.  So, having each thread be able to work on the same list at the same time is required for the multithreading to improve my performance.  So, I dont think locking around the entire iteration, or putting the whole iteration is a synchronizedlist block, will work.p  hr  pEdit 2 I think I got it.  The trick was not just to synchronize on the list when adding elements to it, but also when determining if there are any more elements.  This prevents thread 2 from stopping its iteration before thread 1 finishes adding to the list.  It looks a bit kludgy, but this keeps the code that I need to run in multiple threads outside the synchronize block, so my real case should get the performance increase I need.p  pThanks to everyone who helpedp  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List  public class ListChecker2 implements Runnable      static ListltIntegergt list  new ArrayListltIntegergt      int id     StringBuilder result  new StringBuilder       public ListChecker2int id         this.id  id           Override     public void run          int i  0         do             synchronized list                             if i gt list.size                     list.addid                     System.out.printlnid     result.toString                     return                                           result.appendlist.geti.append,             System.out.printlnrunning   id          whiletrue            public static void mainString[] args         forint i1 ilt30 i             ListChecker2 checker  new ListChecker2i             new Threadchecker.start                      codepre

Negative 72257 pOk I know the basics about when indexing should be used and the pros and cons of using it. p  pThese are the only two ways my queries will look likep  precodeSELECT targetid FROM map WHERE tablename   AND fingerprint   AND sourceid  1 codepre  pandp  precodeSELECT fingerprint, sourceid FROM map WHERE tablename   AND targetid  1 codepre  pI know I have to index fields codetablenamecode, codefingerprintcode and codesourceidcode going by first query. Also codetargetidcode going by the second query. I can do that individually. But I have heard composite keys give better performance if I could index all the fields as one. Since my case is so specific that there wont be another WHERE clause, I thought of creating composite keys like thisp  precodetablename, fingerprint, sourceid codepre  pandp  precodetablename, targetid codepre  pBut since codetablenamecode overlaps in both composite indexing, I am unsure if thats the way to go. Are there performance implications with such overlapping p  pWhen I did some testing, I did not get any performance improvements with either, both were equally fast.I have about only few tens of thousands of records right now, may be thats the reason. But data will scale to millions of records. So I thought of getting expert opinion on it. Thanks.p

Negative 72257 pIve been using websocketjs for websocket support across devices. Works great in all IOS devices as they have native websocket support, and works fairly consistently in android devices when you have flash installed. Now, Android ICS 4.03 and above claims to support native websockets. Window.WebSocket is defined, but Im having no luck opening the socket. Does anyone know why What is the problem with ICS native websockets What protocol do they use Has anyone come up with a better solutionp  pUpdatep  pThere is a hacky way to determine if the websocket actually works, and then fallback to flash. To do this you have to change the websocketjs code to check if it is an android client. then, before using the websocket, try to connect to a port on the local machine. Then check the protocol property of the websocket. If this is defined, then you are good to go with native, otherwise fall back to flash. Still looking for a better way, but here is the hack that I am using nowp  pegp  precode   var isAndroid  navigator.userAgent.matchAndroidi  null    var isChrome  navigator.userAgent.matchChromei  null      assume if its safari, that they use normal websockets.    if  isChrome  isAndroid ampamp window.WebSocket            logger.logWill attempt to use Websockets natively. 1           return           check if we need a websocket fallback    if window.WebSocket ampamp window.WEBSOCKETFORCEFLASH     if  isAndroid             try                   var testSock  new window.WebSocketwslocalhost1474                  if testSock.protocol  undefined                         testSock.close                        logger.logWill attempt to use Websockets natively. 2                        return                   else                          use flash                              catch e                    if there was an error we need to use the flash fallback.                    logger.logNative Websockets unavailable, trying Flash fallback... codepre

Negative 72257 pI am trying to create my own Haar Cascade xml file for use in object recognition.  By following this a hrefhttpnayakamitarup.blogspot.in201107howtomakeyourownhaartrainedxml.html relnofollowtutoriala I managed to get it working.  However, creating the xmlfile takes an extreme amount of time, apparently it can run into a few weeks I cancelled my own attempt after two days it was nowhere near complete.p  pI then came across a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumfromgroupstopicandroidopencvwgcNLPfGpM relnofollowthis groupa where it seems that this process can be reduced from 3 weeks to 30 minutes by using a hrefhttpwww.threadingbuildingblocks.org relnofollowTBBa Thread Building Blocks.  This will speed up the process by utilising all the cores in your system.p  pThe catch is that to use TBB you need to build OpenCV from source, something which I have no experience in.  I am following this a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgdoctutorialsintroductionwindowsinstallwindowsinstall.html relnofollowtutoriala, but I do not really understand what I am doing.p  pI will try and describe my troublesp  p1. Almost all the tutorials mention using Visual Studio to build and configure OpenCV.  Does this mean that this OpenCV  TBB setup will only work in the Visual Studio IDE, or will I still be able to do my actual Python  OpenCV TBB development in Eclipsep  p2. At the end the abovementioned tutorial explains that you can create a .exe file to install your new flavor of OpenCV on other systems.  If this is so simple, why has noone made such an exe OpenCV  TBB availablep  pI hope that this makes sense, I am new to building libraries from source, because I usually stick with the installfiles for convenience.p  pAny advice on how to get TBB working with OpenCV and Python will be greatly appreciated, or even just some clarification of the concepts used in the process.p  pExtrap  pI am using Windows 7 64bit, Python 2.7, Eclipse Indigo.  I do have Visual Studio 2010 installed on my computer apparently I need a Ccompiler.p

Negative 72257 pIm writing a couple wrapper classes for the SSE Intrinsics  mostly to get typesafe geometry operations, but also to add a couple convenience functions.  All my functions and operators are inline.  In theory, theyll all compile directly to raw SSE assembly no function calls, and my electrons will never leave the XMM registers.p  pHow do I pass my SSE classes as arguments to ensure this resultp  pI never modify my arguments, so the choice is mostly between passing by value or passing by const reference.  I assume a good compiler will optimize both styles down the same code. But I dont know that for sure.  Can someone with more experience in the area expound on the best practicesp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 72257 pAfter seeing a conversation in a forum from many years ago that was never resolved, it caused me to wonder how one would correctly create a tuple that referenced itself.

Negative 72257 pOn a Rails 3 application we have a highly normalized database schema, which is necessary for multiple reasons.  Additionally, we need to provide some readonly RESTful routes whose virtual resources are derived from the combined denormalized data from several models and we must present the results as a JSON document.p  pFor example, we would have models like State, City, and Neighborhood, each with their own data and associations.  The RESTful resource is the Neighborhood but we always want to include the name of the associated State and City.  So a GET request to the URI codeneighborhoodnmalbuquerquecode would return a JSON array of all the neighborhoods in Albuquerque, NM, for examplep  pre classlangjavascript prettyprintoverridecode[stateNM,cityAlbuquerque,neighborhoodNorth Valley,  stateNM,cityAlbuquerque,neighborhoodNortheast Heights, ... ] codepre  pHowever, omitting the city name in the URI codeGET neighborhoodnmcode would return a list of all the neighborhoods in all of the cities in New Mexico.p  pstrongWhat is the Rails 3 preferred approach to generating the database query in this situationstrongp  pThe most direct approach I can imagine is to generate a custom SQL query which selects the necessary data from the database and returns the resulting records as JSON, without performing any ActiveRecord object deserialization since we just need raw data with no processing, for examplep  pre classlangruby prettyprintoverridecodedef neighborhood  our Action in the target Controller...   state, city, hood  params[state], params[city], params[hood]   query  ltltHERE     SELECT s.name AS state, c.name AS city, n.name AS neighborhood     FROM states AS s, cities AS c, neighborhoods AS n     WHERE n.cityidc.id AND c.stateids.id   HERE   query   AND s.slug  ActiveRecordBase.sanitizestate if state   query   AND c.slug  ActiveRecordBase.sanitizecity if city   query   AND n.slug  ActiveRecordBase.sanitizehood if hood   query   ORDER BY state, city, neighborhood ASC   render json gt ActiveRecordBase.connection.selectallquery end codepre  pThis solution is conceptually straightforward and relies on the database for the heavy lifting but feels distinctly unRailsish.  Ive tried achieving the same effect using a combination of ArelAR queries and asjson overrides but I cant seem to get it right and efficient after some time and frustration.p  pAm I missing something big, new, and cool in Rails 3 or is this just a situation where the quickanddirty solution is the right way to gop

Negative 72257 pI have a sqlserver table with the usual p  pcodeintIDprimary key,field1,field2,manyotherfields..., datetime TimeOperationcodep  p99 of my different kind of queries start with a codeTimeOperation BETWEEN startTime AND endTimecode, and then codeselect  or count where fieldAxxxcode, and join with other smaller tables. codeselect code because more or less I need all the fields.p  pI obviusly created an index on codeTimeOperationcode ... but performance are not good enough, so I want to add some index key columns or index included columns, but Im a little bit confused.p  pI get the difference between the two, but I dont get how much adding a column in each case impacts on speed and on size.p  pI guess that the biggest improvement would be to create an index including ALL the columns, is it right but I cant afford it in terms of spacep  pAnd if I often use codefield1xxxcode for example, adding codefield1code to the index key columns after codeTimeOperationcode would give better performance rightp  pAlso...just to be sure how an index with included columns works if I select rows with codeTimeOperationcode in a certain range, sql seeks my TimeOperation index for the rows Im interested in, and it is faster than scanning all the table because in the index the TimeOperation values are in ascending order, is it right  But then I need all the data now I need all the rest of the data fields of those rows...how does sql acts to retrieve the data I guess it has a sort of bookmark to those rows in the index, right But it has to hit the table multiple times then... so including all the columns in the index will save the time to hit the table, it it correctp  pThanks Mattiap

Now i need for this 3 to communicate. The webserver sends data to an ip addressclientdevice based on button pressed on the webpage. but before the data is sent, the data must first access the linux machine, the machine then sends the data down to the device which then the device reads the data and act based on the command sent.. then the device sends back data to the linux machine which then the linux machine sends it to the webserver for ackd. meaning data is received by the device without any problems.p  ol lipPhp is for the webserver. Now how will php sends data to an ip adress.pli lipThe linux machine handles all requests and sends everything down to the device and when the device got the data it will send a data to linux machine which then machine sends an ok to the webserver that the data arrived succesfully.I read about socket programming and i think of creating an application that reads requests. or if you have any idea how can i do this.pli lipHow can the device read a data sent by the webserver..pli ol  pThanks,p  pstrongEDITstrong The device is not connected to the linux machine. the device is only connnected via the ethernet cable.p

Negative 72257 pI used to strongstopAllActionsstrong when running a new action.

I used to call [self stopAllActions] whenever running a new action but this doesnt quiet fit with the usage of CCTintBy action it does stop also that action and leave the sprite being half coloured and the base colour would have changed as the reverse function would not have being called as being stopped by the stopAllActions. p  pI leave you with the most common actions in my project. I was thinking to instead of calling stopAllActions, to call only stop a specific action if the action is not already running. Would this be good practicep  precode void runExplosionAnimation   [self stopAllActions] here should verify if the action is not already running and if so stop it To do so I should have a member variable like CCAction  explosionAnim  [CCSequence actions [CCAnimate actionWithDuration0.4f animationanim restoreOriginalFramefalse],  [CCHide action],  nil] Plus a boolean to distinguish if it is already running..   CCAnimation anim  [[CCAnimationCache sharedAnimationCache] animationByNamebbb] ifanimnil     [self runAction[CCSequence actions [CCAnimate actionWithDuration0.4f animationanim restoreOriginalFramefalse],  [CCHide action],  nil]]  else     [self loadSharedAnimationIfNeeded]   codepre  pA way around to using a boolean to determien if the CCTintBy action is still running is to restore the original colour manually before calling the CCTintBy action again.p  precodevoid gotHitWithFactorintfactor      [self runGotHitAnimation]  self.hitPoints  factor  1 if self.hitPoints lt 0      isAlivefalse       [self runExplosionAnimation] Will also set enemy visibility to false     void runGotHitAnimation      hitAction is initialized as [CCTintBy actionWithDuration0.1f red100 green100 blue111]      [self stopActionhitAction]     self.color  originalColour Where originalcolour is initialized as self.colour     [self runActionhitAction]  codepre

Negative 72257 pIm using EF 5 and I need to somehow hack into the connection creation pipeline.  Heres my situation.  In production, we have 2 SQL servers I dont have any control over this which I have specified in my web.config.  If one connection fails, I need to try the other one.  Once again, I know about SQL failover clustering but like I said, I have no control over that.p  pI tried using the codeDbContextcode overload which takes a codeDbConnectioncode.  Then I tried to open the connection myself to see if its successful, then pass it on to EF.  The problem there was that EF only wants a closed connection.  And it seems really hokey to open a connection, then close it, only to have EF open it againp  pIs there a better wayp

Negative 72257 pIm trying to pass a delegate through a method to another object. It works briefly, but then becomes null. I think Ive figured out whats causing it but not how to solve it.p  pSo Blocks in iOS automatically copy any variables that are referenced. I have a method where the user passes in a delegate object. A block is executed for a managed object context, which in turn makes a web request where the delegate is passed. What I think is happening, is this block is making a copy of the delegate object, and the passing it on to the request, but then the block finishes execution and the delegate is released.p  pIs there a way I can simply pass the original delegate object through rather than the block making a copy of itp  precodeNSManagedObjectContext context  [[MPCoreDataManager sharedInstance] managedObjectContext] [context performBlock     block NSError error     NSFetchRequest request  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] initWithEntityNameNSStringFromClass[self class]]     [request setSortDescriptors[[[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeykey ascendingasc selectorselectorcaseInsensitiveCompare]]]      NSFetchedResultsController controller  [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] initWithFetchRequestrequest                                                                                  managedObjectContextcontext                                                                                    sectionNameKeyPathkeyPath                                                                                             cacheNamenil]      [controller performFetchamperror]      if controller.fetchedObjects  controller.fetchedObjects.count  0           Nothing found or an error, query the server instead                 NSString url  [NSString stringWithFormat, kMPBASEAPIURL, [self baseURL]]         MPRequest objRequest  [MPRequest requestWithURLurl]           objRequest.delegate  delegate          [objRequest setRequestMethodGET]         [MPUser signRequestobjRequest]          [objRequest submitMPResponse resp, NSError err              if err                  blocknil, err              else                  NSArray objects  [self createListWithResponseresp]                          objects  [MPModel saveAllLocallyobjects forEntityNameNSStringFromClass[self class]]                 [controller performFetchamperror]                 blockcontroller, nil                       ]       else           Great, we found something          block controller, nil      ] codepre  pThis is the code Im using.

Negative 72257 pI am currently writing an admin page for my webserver, to make it easier on myself to create new apache domains from my browser. Everything is pretty much working as I want it to, except for one thing.p  pTo elaborate I have a cron job on my server running a bash script as root that checks a file containing a list of domain names that I want to be created. If the file contains a domain name, it automatically creates a new virtual host for this domain, edits my hosts file, and restarts the server. This all works perfectly, however what I would like for the script to do, is that it activates the domain that it automatically creates before it restarts the server. I tried doing this using apache 2s codea2ensitecode command, however the script returns an error saying the command is not found.p  pIs there a way to call this command from a bash script, or is there an alternative to this command that I can callp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Currently, whenever I zoom inout with the mouse wheel, the corner in the top left of the image stays in the same place.  Ive had a difficult time finding a correct algorithm.  p  pTo zoom into the picture, the code uses an AffineTransform object which scales the image according to a double value which increases or decreases based on the movement of the mouse wheel. p  pWhat also adds to the complexity is that the image can also be clicked and dragged around the panel.  If it is clicked and dragged, the zoom must still zoom in on whats in the center of the PANEL, and not the center of the actual image necessarily.p  pOnce again, the zooming should be done relative to the center point of the currently visible area. That is, as zooming occurs, the point at the center of the view should remain fixed.p  pThis is the code and its executablep  precodepackage clientgui  import java.awt.  import javax.imageio.ImageIO import javax.swing.  import java.awt.event. import java.awt.geom. import java.awt.image.BufferedImage import java.net.URL  import javax.swing.border.TitledBorder  public class MoveImageExample extends JFrame      ShowCanvas canvas      public MoveImageExample throws Exception          super         Container container  getContentPane         canvas  new ShowCanvas                 httpcdn.smosh.comsitesdefaultfilesbloguploadsfunnyiphone5brucelee.jpg         container.setPreferredSizenew Dimensioncanvas.getWidth, canvas                 .getHeight         System.out.printlnwidth    canvas.getWidth   height                    canvas.getHeight         container.addcanvas         pack         setVisibletrue           public static void mainString arg[] throws Exception          new MoveImageExample        SuppressWarningsserial class ShowCanvas extends JPanel      int imageX  0, imageY  0     int lastMouseX  0, lastMouseY  0     int centerX  225     int centerY  225     int canvasWidth  450     int canvasHeight  450     double scaleFactor  1.0     boolean firstMouseDrag  true     BufferedImage image      public ShowCanvasString imagePath throws Exception          setBackgroundColor.white         MouseMotionHandler mouseHandler  new MouseMotionHandler         addMouseMotionListenermouseHandler         addMouseListenermouseHandler         addMouseWheelListenermouseHandler         URL url  new URLimagePath         Image rawImage  ImageIO.readurl         image  new BufferedImagerawImage.getWidththis,                 rawImage.getHeightthis, BufferedImage.TYPEINTARGB         setSizeimage.getWidth, image.getHeight         Graphics2D g2  image.createGraphics         g2.drawImagerawImage, imageX, imageY, this           public void paintComponentGraphics g          super.paintComponentg         Graphics2D g2D  Graphics2D g         g2D.setColorColor.gray         g.fillRect0, 0, image.getWidth, image.getHeight         AffineTransform transformer  new AffineTransform          translate the image back using new scale factor         transformer.scalescaleFactor, scaleFactor  scale by 2x on x and y                                                          axes.         transformer.translateimageX  scaleFactor, imageY  scaleFactor         g2D.drawImageimage, transformer, this           class MouseMotionHandler extends MouseMotionAdapter implements             MouseListener, MouseWheelListener          public void mousePressedMouseEvent e              lastMouseX  e.getX             lastMouseY  e.getY                   public void mouseDraggedMouseEvent e              int xDiff  e.getX  lastMouseX             int yDiff  e.getY  lastMouseY             imageX  imageX  xDiff             imageY  imageY  yDiff             lastMouseX  e.getX             lastMouseY  e.getY             repaint                   public void mouseWheelMovedMouseWheelEvent e              int notches  e.getWheelRotation             scaleFactor  scaleFactor  notches  10.0             if scaleFactor lt 0.5                  scaleFactor  0.5              else if scaleFactor gt 3.0                  scaleFactor  3.0                          repaint                   public void mouseReleasedMouseEvent e                    public void mouseEnteredMouseEvent e                    public void mouseExitedMouseEvent e                    public void mouseClickedMouseEvent e                 codepre

Negative 72257 pI know that my approach isnt practical, but this is going to help me get used to Java a bit more. I am trying to create a JButton subclass named MyButton. MyButton basically will create a new Gui button, with a custom image background. I know how to create a new button in the class, but dont know how to refer to the button that the MyButton class creates. As the code shows, the buttons icon needs to be set, but this needs to be done inside the subclass, so that said used doesnt have to use it. On creation, the coder inputs the string that refers to the texture, and then the MyButton has all the properties of a JButton, but also already has its image set. Below is my source code.p  precodepackage Classes import javax.swing.ImageIcon import javax.swing.JButton  public class MyButton extends JButton private static final long serialVersionUID  1L  public JButton abc  new JButton private ImageIcon def private MyButton ghi  public MyButtonString image      def  new ImageIcongetClass.getResourceimage      abc.setIcondef     abc.setPressedIcondef      ghi  new MyButtonimage.png     ghi.setIcondef     codepre  pstrongUPADTEstrong Solved it.

I can open a hex editor and navigate to code0x55de4code and the codemovqcode instruction is there.p  pHowever, I noticed that gdb only works when I include all 8 bytes in the address, including the mysterious code1code.  codebreak 0x0000000100055de4code works as expected, while codebreak 0x00055de4code never triggers.p  pEvery 64bit binary I have analyzed with codeotoolcode shows this pattern.

Negative 72257 pI have created a UIViewController with a UIScrollView. On the scrollView I have a page control.

Negative 72257 pSo Im developing an application that works as sort of a sidekick to a large proprietary application which I do not have the source code for nor the rights to modify. The proprietary application emdoesem store all of its data in a Microsoft SQL database version 2008 R2 or higher, I believe, however, and I have a good idea what the data represents. What I need my application to do is to constantly monitor the data as it is being added, updated, and deleted, and then act on the data automatically such as raising alerts.p  pThe issue is figuring out the best approach to receiving changes made to the database by the other application as theyre happening, because I emdont wanna miss a beatem.p  pHere is emwhat I have done so faremp  ol listrongLINQ to SQLstrong As far as I know, each time I run a query, I receive a new set of data, but I do not get the ability to receive the changes only or be notified of changes.li lipstrongTyped DataSet using DataSet.Loadstrongp  precodeusing IDataReader reader  dataSetInstance.CreateDataReader      dataSetInstance.Loadreader, LoadOption.OverwriteChanges, dataSetInstance.Table1, dataSetInstance.Table2, dataSetInstance.Table3  codepre  pThis didnt work out too well when I did it. codedataSetInstancecode only contained a set of unfilled tables after calling the codeLoadcode method. I was hoping to call codedataSetInstance.GetChangescode and codedataSetInstance.AcceptChangescode at regular intervals after the first call to codedataSetInstance.Loadcode to get only the changes. Am I doing it wrongpli lipstrongTyped DataSet with tables filled individually using their associated table adaptersstrongp  precodeusing Table1TableAdapter adapter  new Table1TableAdapter      adapter.FilldataSetInstance.Table1   using Table2TableAdapter adapter  new Table2TableAdapter      adapter.FilldataSetInstance.Table2   using Table3TableAdapter adapter  new Table3TableAdapter      adapter.FilldataSetInstance.Table3  codepre  pOf course, the problem is that there are actually way more than 3 tables which can add up to quite a lot of repetitive code and maintenance work, but the real problem is that I will not receive any change notifications since Im not using the codeLoadcodecodeAcceptChangescode methods according to the documentation.pli listrongRow retrieval by datetime fieldstrong This was something I started work on, but something I stopped after observing the other application modify fields in the rows after creating them. Consider this     There is a row with a time stamp of a transaction and a boolean field that specifies if the transaction was canceled later on. If it is canceled, the other application simply goes back to that row and toggles the value. The time stamp remains the same, and my application will never know of the news. There is no emstatute of limitationsem the other application can change this field any time in the future.li ol  pBy the way, I should mention that this other application does not implement any constraints within the database such as foreign and primary keys. I believe I read somewhere in the documentation that for row update events and such to fire on the typed DataTable classes, some sort of primary key is needed.p  pThere must be some way to do thisp

Let me just give you an example.p  pInput HTMLp  precodeltdivgt   some text ltbrgt   ltspangt some more text ltspangt ltbrgt   ltspangt and more text ltspangt ltdivgt codepre  pHTML that BeautifulSoup interpretsp  precodeltdivgt   some text   ltbrgt     ltspangt some more text ltspangt     ltbrgt       ltspangt and more text ltspangt     ltbrgt   ltbrgt ltdivgt codepre  pIn the source, the spans could be considered siblings. After parsing using the default parser, the spans are suddenly no longer siblings, as the br tags became part of the structure.p  pThe solution I can think of to solve this is to strip the codeltbrgtcode tags altogether, before pouring the html into Beautifulsoup, but that doesnt seem very elegant, as it requires me to change the input. Whats a better way to solve thisp

Negative 72257 pI have a form that loads a codeDataGridViewcode. I created a codeCellPaintingcode event to color the rows based on cell values. I did a codeCellPaintingcode because iterating back over the rows in the codeDatagridviewcode and painting them took WAY too long, so this is more efficient. p  pstrongThe problemsstrong p  ul liThe codeCellPaintingcode event does not for form load. Meaning all the rows are hidden, until I scroll or click on them, then they are painted correctly based on cell values. li liThe other thing I noticed is that the Column Headers are missing. Other issue is when I scroll down the codeDataGridViewcode Rows with the scroll bar, the codeCellPaintingcode is called again, and I have to wait several seconds as it repaints the row colors. This is quite annoying especially when I have thousands of rows, and scrolling causes a delay every time I scroll. li ul  pAll of these issues go away, and the codeDatagridViewcode column headers and rows all appear when I remove the codeCellPaintingcode method, so the problem is obviously there.

If I go far enough it eventually determines that it is not visible, but this is some distance after it has exited the frustum.p  pI am using a unit sphere at the origin for the test. I am using the OpenGL Mathematics GLM library for vector and matrix data structures and for its built in math functions. Here is my code for the visibility function p  precodevoid visibilityTestconst struct MVP mvp      static bool visLastTime  true     bool visThisTime      const glmvec4 modelCenterworldSpace  glmvec40,0,0,1    at origin     const int negRadius  1   unit sphere      Get cam space model center     glmvec4 modelCentercameraSpace  mvpgtview  mvpgtmodel  modelCenterworldSpace     Get Frustum Planes     extract projection matrix row vectors     NOTE since glm stores their mats in columnmajor order, we extract columns     glmvec4 rowVec[4]     forint i  0 i lt 4 i          rowVec[i]  glmvec4 mvpgtprojection[0][i], mvpgtprojection[1][i], mvpgtprojection[2][i], mvpgtprojection[3][i]            determine frustum clipping planes in camera space     glmvec4 plane[6]     NOTE recall that indices start at zero.

Then Im extending the far plane one unit further due to the spheres radius of one D  D  C1 p  pIve looked over this code many times and I cant see why it shouldnt work. Any help is appreciated. p  pEDIT I cant answer my own question as I dont have the rep, so I will post it here. The problem was that I wasnt normalizing the plane equations. This didnt seem to make much of a difference for any of the clip planes besides the far one, so I hadnt even considered it but that didnt make it any less wrong. After normalization everything works properly.  p

Negative 72257 pIs it possible to trigger an API call after an event takes place in Quickbooks For example, if a user adds a bill to Quickbooks, it would make an API call to our Salesforce.com app and create a new Bill record in our Salesforce org. This would allow us to use our Salesforce workflow to trigger an approval process for the bill to be paid approved by manager, create task for bookkeeper, etc, without the bill ever having to be manually input into two separate systems.p  pI know that I can do it the other way around input the bill into Salesforce, have it push the record to Quickbooks and simultaneously launch the approval process, however, Quickbooks has the ability to remember vendoraccount information that, for large companies, is an invaluable timesaver.p  pAny idea if it is possible to trigger these events on the Quickbooks side Thanksp

Negative 72257 pI have encountered a weird problem with ThreadPoolExecutor of Java 6. From time to time when i have changed corePoolSize dynamically, i observed thread pool did not process as much task as it should have done.p  pFor example, if i had 4 as corePoolSize and had lots of tasks waiting in the queue, the executor were processing 3 at most, sometimes 2 even.p  pWhen was investigating the problem, i noticed i have never changed maxPoolSize when i increased or decreased corePoolSize. It has always been 1 from the beginning of my application.p  pNever found a statement in Javas documentation mentioning the effect of maxPoolSize beeing smaller than core.p  pThen when i checked the source code, i have noticed both in costructor and setCorePoolSize methods, it gets checked where maximumPoolSize is smaller than corePoolSize, if so illegalArgumentException is thrown. Check out the codes below.p  pConstructorp  precodepublic ThreadPoolExecutor     int corePoolSize,     int maximumPoolSize,     long keepAliveTime,     TimeUnit unit,     BlockingQueueltRunnablegt workQueue,     ThreadFactory threadFactory,     RejectedExecutionHandler handler       if corePoolSize lt 0          maximumPoolSize lt 0          maximumPoolSize lt corePoolSize          keepAliveTime lt 0             throw new IllegalArgumentException     if workQueue  null  threadFactory  null  handler  null         throw new NullPointerException     this.corePoolSize  corePoolSize     this.maximumPoolSize  maximumPoolSize     this.workQueue  workQueue     this.keepAliveTime  unit.toNanoskeepAliveTime     this.threadFactory  threadFactory     this.handler  handler  codepre  psetting max pool sizep  precodepublic void setMaximumPoolSizeint maximumPoolSize      if maximumPoolSize lt 0  maximumPoolSize lt corePoolSize         throw new IllegalArgumentException     final ReentrantLock mainLock  this.mainLock     mainLock.lock     try          int extra  this.maximumPoolSize  maximumPoolSize         this.maximumPoolSize  maximumPoolSize         if extra gt 0 ampamp poolSize gt maximumPoolSize              try                  IteratorltWorkergt it  workers.iterator                 while it.hasNext ampamp                        extra gt 0 ampamp                        poolSize gt maximumPoolSize                      it.next.interruptIfIdle                     extra                               catch SecurityException ignore                   Not an error it is OK if the threads stay live                            finally          mainLock.unlock       codepre  pSo, clearly that is an unwanted situation.

I have a function that will return the next value, but I cannot seem to get the list added element by element.

Negative 72257 pNot being this my job, I still have only very little knowledge of SQL, my question is to get directions on how to approach this problem. I hope the question is not too generic or meaninglessp  pI have several tables in a db. Few of them are basic tables, list of countries, list of customers and so on.  These basic tables are used to support values in dropDownLists on other grids where users use preset values for certain fields and they also fill in other fields manually. Something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comq5kBv.png altenter image description herep  pNow, I am working on a dynamic report that points to the table where I need to get the actual values and not the references.p  pAs I said, the problem I have is that those preset values in that particular table I am working on, are idreferences idCountry, idCustomer, .. while I need the actual value they represent. What should I do to get the actual values If I point my report to different tables I loose the meaninglink between the records.p

Negative 72257 pI want to create a web application that will potentially have a mobile application to accompany it. p  pThe web application will be created with AngularJS.

Negative 72257 pI have simple app with two views the first view has a button, and when you press it you get a modal segue to another view.

Then codeUsercode and codePostcode automatically inherit the instance variables of codeStatuscode and they get persisted in separate tables. However this approach does not seem appropriate as codeUsercode and codePostcode are not actually a codeStatuscode.li liI can redefine the codeStatuscode instance variables in codeUsercode and codePostcode, and then do something like this in codeUsercode and codePostcodeli ol  pre      static constraints           importFrom Status           other constraints        pre  pbQuestionsbp  ul liIs one approach better than the otherli liIs there a better way of achieving thisli liIs there a best practices that Grails pros can recommendli ul  pNote The codeStatuscode domain has many instance variables what is presented here is a stripped down version, and I need to access its instance variables from many other domains codeUsercode, codePostcode, and many other. Otherwise I could have just gotten ride of the codeStatuscode domain and just define those instance variables in codeUsercode and codePostcode separately. The approach 2 mentioned above kind of does this, except that it saves retyping the constraints by just using codeimportFrom Statuscode.p

Negative 72257 pIve been trying to do something that seems surprisingly challenging  printing an equilateral triangle to the command line Terminal for Mac OS X. I have a program that can compute the nth row of Pascals triangle up to some userspecified constant. As is well known, if one takes the values of Pascals triangle modulo two, there is a correlation between that and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSierpinskitriangle relnofollowSierpinskis trianglea.p  pI have been setting odd values to be 1 and even values to be 0, and when I print the results on the Terminal and zoom out, it looks nice, apart from the fact that its clearly not equilateral. Here is an example output of my program after zooming way out so zeroes and ones look much differentp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPOrm2.png altenter image description herep  pBut Im wondering ... is there a way to get this triangle to look equilateral Or do I have to print the output somewhere else Ive been experimenting with different fonts, different line width levels, but I cant get anything to look close to equilateral, and even if it does, I dont have a reliable way of checking for this. Part of the problem is also that zooming inout on the Terminal results in different line width and height scales.p  pMy code takes in as input the number of rows to generate. Then, it takes that number into account when printing out each row. So the first row which is just a single 1 would have n1 spaces to print before printing the 1. Then the second row has to print n2 spaces before printing its actual contents which are 1 1, which includes a space between each number, and so on. Its in C, but I dont think that should matter.p  pI suspect that Ill need to find some other way of getting the image out, so any advice about libraries to use would be great.p

Negative 72257 pIf I am highlighting a segment of code where the horizontal scrollbar is employed to show this segment with the mouse and the mouse pointer happens to drift over the line before or after the line I am hightlighting and this line I have drifted over ends before the column width of the buffer, in other words the horizontal scrollbar is not needed to see the end of this line then the scrollwindow automatically scrolls horizontally back to the end of the line I have drifted over. Is their anyway to disable this behavior  Is their a way to block the signal from the gtksourceview buffer to the scrollwindowp  pSorry for the extreme runon sentence, but I could not think of a more concise way to describe my problem.

Negative 72257 pIm currently designing an ARV for my microelectronics class and need to implement a USART on the PIC18f45k20. So far ive gotten it to receive the first character into the RCREG on a high priority interrupt. However, when it exits the interrupt service routine, and the program goes back into its main loop, the USART doesnt interrupt again and the other characters arent received. I suspect that it has something to do with my interrupt because it seems to receive the correct data.

Negative 72257 pI have a fresh install of Eclipse Kepler Service Release 2, Build id 201402240627.  I used the Eclipse Marketplace to install Subclipse 1.10.  I upgraded the Mac to use Subversion 1.8.8.  Checking svn version confirms this p  psvn, version 1.8.8 r1568071    compiled Feb 18 2014, 201510 on x8664appledarwin13.0.0p  pHowever, with a fresh code checkout in Eclipse, whenever I attempt to run an ANT task via Eclipse rightclick, I get the This client is too old... error.  This is not happening with checkout or commits to my code base, only when I am running my ANT task.  p  pThe initialization task that runs first in my ANT file calls svn info.  If I run this from the command line in the root of my workspace, I get back the usual svn info stuff repo root, UUID, etc.p  pHowever when I run ANT and call svn info from my init task, here is the error message I getp  precode [echo] svninfo is svn E155021 This client is too old to work with the working copy at  [echo] UsersltusernamegtDocumentsworkspacemyCode format 31. codepre  pI understand the fundamental idea of the message.  But I am under the impression that Subclipse 1.10 was released for Subversion 1.8.8.  Obviously I am wrong.  Can anyone suggest the easiest way to proceed  p  pIs my ANT svn info calling the Mac svn like I think it is Or is there some other place where I have to set some configuration  Do I need to install an older version of Subclipse How do I do that from the Eclipse Marketplace when it always only offers me the latest version  So many questions, so little time... Thanks in advance.p

Negative 72257 pFirst of all, I would like to say that I am pretty new to applets I dont plan on developing any, but I have a school project to complete on them. I have a couple of questions before posting my codep  pWhy is the coordinate system of the applet window so messed up I suppose it should show the first quadrant of a coordinate system by default, which should mean that 0, 0 is in the lower left corner and 500, 500 if thats the size of the window should be in the upper right corner. However, 0, 0 is in the upper left corner and 500, 500 in in the lower right. Why is that so and is there a simple fix for itp  pIn my code some of it provided by the teacher there is a trycatch block containing thisp  precodeThread.currentThread.sleep40 codepre  pIt runs smoothly on any other computer Ive tried but mine. Unless I set the number to 100 the ball keeps flickering and flashing on the screen, instead of running smoothly and when I do set it to 100, it starts moving really slowly.p  pNow, I have to make an applet that animates a ball moving on an inverted parabolic trajectory, whose radius increases when going up and decreases when going down. It should change its colour during its run.p  pHeres my codep  precodeimport java.awt. import java.applet.  public class Ball extends Applet implements Runnable       private static final long serialVersionUID  1L     double x, y, xInit, wide  100, high  400     int dx, dy, diam, sizex, sizey     int wide  100, high  400     int xIncrement  1     int xInit  intparabolaX 0, wide, high     int x  xInit     int y  intparabolaY x, wide, high     int diam, sizex, sizey     Thread ballPlay  new Threadthis      public void init               setBackgroundColor.black         diam  12         setSize500, 500         sizex  500         sizey  500         ballPlay.start       public void run       while true               try   Thread.currentThread.sleep100          catch InterruptedException e          if x lt xInit ampamp y gt 0              x  xIncrement          else              xInit  intparabolaX 0, wide, high             x  xInit                  repaint        returns yvalue of parabola int parabolaY int x, int wideness, int highness    equation of parabola   int y  widenessxx  highness    return y   returns xvalue of parabola int parabolaX int y, int wideness, int highness    equation of parabola   int x  intMath.sqrty  highnesswideness    return x    public void paintGraphics g                  g.setColorColor.red         System.out.printlnPAINTING...

By tweaking it in numerous ways, I have succeeded in putting the ball in its initial position 100, 400 but no movement whatsoever happened. Browsing the net the other day I found this  a hrefhttpwww.openprocessing.orgsketch25434 relnofollowhttpwww.openprocessing.orgsketch25434a And it is exactly what I need without the radius and color changing part and still I cant figure it out. Obviously, theres something or most probably many things Im doing completely wrong but having almost no clue how applets work, I cant seem to find the problem. The code is a mashup of some of the code provided by my teacher and the one from the webpage.p  pWhat I want to do is make an animation of the ball moving on an inverted parabolic trajectory with a starting position 100, 400. After completing the parabola it should return to its initial position and continue looping te animation. However, with the current code it isnt even close to working as I need it to.p

Negative 72257 pI would like my Button to have its currentState initialized with my own defined state.

I solved this by overwriting the commitProperties function and by calling the function onConnectionChange after the skin calls the function commitProperties. Here is my overwritten commitProperties function of my ButtonSkinp  precode                    override protected function commitPropertiesvoid                      super.commitProperties             onConnectionChangenull          codepre  pSince I do not know how much processing changing the currentState causes, I am afraid that by calling to many times the function onConnectionChange and therefore changing the currentState several times I am affecting negatively the performance. The thing is the function onConnectionChange itself causes the commitProperties to be called. So there is extra processing already there. Question is how much and isnt there a better approach for this. Thank you very much...p

Negative 72257 pIm trying to retrieve data from a websocket using my own web server. The websocket server on the remote host runs websocketrails. From the Websocketrails github project page a hrefhttpsgithub.comwebsocketrails relnofollowhttpsgithub.comwebsocketrailsa I used the javascript client code to put together a web socket client in a html file. That is, I copied the contents of all CoffeeScript files in libassetsjavascriptswebsocketrails on github to a single file and then compiled it with js2coffee.org probably better solutions, but im quite a noob as you may have noticed by now. Then added a few lines to connect to the remote web socket and subscribe to a channel. the channel part is actually why I use the Websocketrails client, instead of a normal web socket connection. As I couldnt figure out how to subscribe to a channel after connecting through a normal websocket connection.p  pso far so good. When I I use a browser and the code below, I can connect to a channel from the websocket on the remote host and the messages are send to the console.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt ltmeta charsetutf8 gt

Negative 72257 pI am not sure its reasonable, but sending a piece of code through messageAMQP, JMS, ZeroMQ makes much sense in some situation.p  pWe usually use message as plain data which is information made up of primitivesfor example, integer, long, string .... The problem of plain data is it can not represent logic. For instance I have a message likep  precodeclass OperationMsg       String conditionA      String conditionB      String conditionC  codepre  pService A sends this message to other services to instruct them to do some operations. The operation flow is not only decided by conditions encapsulated in message but also the context that services currently have. Then each service has to hard code likep  precodeif msg.conditionA  something ampamp self.context.someContext  something     doSomethingA  else if msg.conditionB  somethind ampamp msg.conditionA  something ampamp self.context.sometContext  something     doSomethingB  codepre  pIf we want to decouple these code from service we have to use some visitor patternGoF, however, its not possible as we are communicating through message and each service may not be in the same process or machine.p  pSo I am thinking if we can send code in message which would do similar like visitor pattern but through message. For dynamic language like Python its doable because of eval function, for static language like Java, its much harder and I am thinking of using some expression language.p  pHowever, I am not sure if this idea sounds weird, please free feel to share your thoughts.p

Negative 72257 pOur Orchard CMS with multitenancy just went down. We have since brought it back online by restoring a version of the database, and then recycling the application pool.

After restoring the database and recycling the application pool, all the tenants are again up and running.p  pWe hadnt done anything particularly unusual e.g. didnt change passwords  firewall rules to precipitate the errors.p  pIts as if something hacked the website, disrupted login, and then started to delete tables or something like that. It occurs to be that Workflows might be involved, because the invalid objects appear related to Workflows, but we dont have any Workflows explicitly setup on our site.p  pI have no other questions than, Why did this happenp  pstrongEdit 1strong Here is a link to the full logs a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B4X0N4NlUl4mOHhWV2JwN1c0Uzgeditpli1 relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B4X0N4NlUl4mOHhWV2JwN1c0Uzgeditpli1ap  pstrongEdit 2strong emCan you elaborate on started to delete tablesem Yes. After a series of codeSqlExceptionscode, in which we could not open the database because the login failed, we started to receive a new codeSqlExceptioncode which reported invalid object names. To me, invalid object name errors mean that Orchard thought tables should have existed that didnt exist. For example p  precodeCould not execute query      select aliasrecor0.Id as Id379,      aliasrecor0.Path as Path379,      aliasrecor0.RouteValues as RouteVal3379,      aliasrecor0.Source as Source379,      aliasrecor0.Actionid as Action5379      from OrchardAliasAliasRecord aliasrecor0      where aliasrecor0.Idgtp0      order by aliasrecor0.Id asc System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException 0x80131904  Invalid object name OrchardAliasAliasRecord. codepre  pTo me the codeOrchardAliasAliasRecordcode table is fundamental and it missing is an odd thing. Why would the SqlException first say that we could access the database, and then say that a fundamental table is invalid My best guess is that something dropped some tables. What else could it bep  pstrongEdit 3strong emDid you actually lose dataem I am not sure. I am a consultant to the company and havent looked at the state of the database after the site went down. I helped to bring the site back on line and then tapped out because I felt over my head.p  pstrongEdit 4strong emWhy do you think workflow may be involvedem I thought that workflows might be involved because two of the invalid objects were codeSchedulingScheduleTaskRecordcode and codeAwaitingActivityRecordcode. While I am not familiar with workflows, these seem to be related to automated tasks, and I think Workflows are involved in automated, schedule tasks. It was a long shot guess.p  pstrongEdit 5strong emWhat are the invalid objects How are they invalidemp  ul licodeSchedulingScheduleTaskRecordcode, li licodeAwaitingActivityRecordcode, and li licodeOrchardAliasRecordcodeli ul  pI am not sure how they are invalid. Usually that means they dont exist or is in a different db schema. Since were using multitenancy, it could be that Orchard emshouldem be looking for a prefixed table instead. I dont see any other hints from the log files. All they tell me is that its an codeSqlException 0x80131904 Invalid object namecode. Its odd that after we restored the database to an earlier version, the errors stopped, which indicates that either Orchard stopped querying those tables or the tables somehow became valid again.p

Even when I log back into UserA and try to log in a new user will be created even though there is already a user myself with an account.p  pQuestions I havep  p1 Is there something I should be doing differently to save a new user  As of right now I dont have any different logic than the ParseFacebookUtils.logIn because that call says that it will automatically create a new user if one doesnt already exist.  I would assume that the same call to that method would also be able to somehow tell that a user with that Facebook Id already exists but maybe this is what I am not doing or misunderstanding of course this that is handled internally by ParseFacebookUtils so I shouldnt have to touch any of that.p  pIf you have any ideas on what is happening I would greatly appreciate to hear them.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe user.isNew method is hit on each login.  The call to this function will be true when the user is created as a result of this call to FacebookUserUtils.logIn.  So obviously something is wrong since this user is actually not new they are already in my apps database but for some reason something is being ignored.p

Negative 72257 pI was trying to update OpenCV to 2.4.9 when I ran into a problem. I cannot find the file that defines MatND. In the old version of OpenCV it was in cxcore.cpp. I searched through google, the CV documentation and the new OpenCV library and found a lot of information regarding MatND but nothing relevant about MatND.  Does anyone know where I can find it  Thank you for your time.p
Negative 72257 pI am developing an AIR application targeting Android OS, using flex 4.6.0  AIR 14.0 sdk. What application generally does is take a vector of Numbers containing 2048 elements, then uses algorithm to produce one Number from given vector, and then does some drawing based on result  and it repeats the process every 100msp  pThe thing is that performances of mentioned algorithm are not as good as I wanted, it often works between 50ms and 100ms, but in some situations it can even go above, and I have about 5060ms for that processing. So, I tried to make Java native extension that would do the complex calculations because I thought it will be faster than as3I read that C is 10 times faster, but C extension is available only on iOS. The thing that makes me problems is the speed of the extension, because it appears to be much slower, and extension is supposed to be used to speed up things.p  pStrange thing is that if I call extension and return array length it finishes for 12ms, but when I copy all array elements from AS3 object to Java double[], it needs about 700800ms, and this is what bothers me. I thought that all data is transferred when extension Java method starts, but why then calling p  pargs[0].getElementAt[0].getAsDoublep  pfor 2048 lasts so long, am I doing something wrong, does anybody know how does data transfer between air and extensions work in detail  Or if anybody knows better way to solve this problem I would be really grateful.p  pHere are some helpful links a hrefhttphelp.adobe.comenUSairextensionsWSff7e9115a8550eef64893a0c132502c6a648000.html relnofollowAndroid extension API referencea and a hrefhttpwww.digitalprimates.netauthornweber20120410buildinganativeextensionpart4 relnofollowExtension code tutoriala  i did everything based on this tutorial, but it is much simpler than my code, so Im posting this.p

Negative 72257 pI have these sql statements in a php function and I have passed all the needed variables. I have 2 insert statements in the query. They are inserting data into the same table, the first insert is for main service, and the second one if for an addon service in my website.p  pSQL somehow takes the value of userid and itemlabel and the first insert works just fine.

Negative 72257 pI have a function that is called several times during the course of my code. It takes 45 of the total time that the code runs as reported by Intel VTune, but, as the function is computationally expensive, Im not horribly surprised by this. What I am surprised by, though, is the amount of time VTune tells me I am spending on just the overhead of calling the function i.e., the time reported right next to the function declaration. The function declaration is as suchp  precodesubroutine tempFuncbeg, matProp, timestep, matID codepre  pThe parameters Im passing to it are simply an codeintegercode, 100 codereal8code variables, another codereal8code, and an array of 32 codeintegercodes. As Fortran passes everything by reference, and there are only 4 variables, I dont believe there should be much overhead associated with this call. However, 15 of the time spent in the function is on said overhead. Looking at the assembly code, all of this time is spent on the following instructionsp  precodemov dword ptr [rsprax1], 0xccccccc sub rax, 0x4 codepre  pI know enough assembly to know that coderspcode is a stack pointer and that coderaxcode is a 64bit register. It appears to me that that the first line is moving a pointer to the coderaxcode register, and that the second line is simply subtracting something from that register. Am I wrong in my understanding If so, what are these two instructions actually doing If not, why are these two instructions taking so much time They seem pretty innocuous.p

Negative 72257 pI currently have a picture box where the user will click and drag to draw a rectangle over an image one that can be changed regularly. When theyre done mouseup, I will display the relative points of the rect in a text box to the resolution. p  pSo, for example, the user draws from top left 0,0 to bottom right of a 1920 x 680 image picturebox.right, picturebox.bottom for a rect, the text box will show 1920,680 for the end point.

Theyre usually pretty large like 1920 x 680 and cant fit in a regular gui. There are multiple resolutions, so got to go dynamic with the ratios. Without editing, this code works great in normal mode, but that doesnt work for usability. So, when you draw the box, its really small and not relative to the mouse so I cant display the end point on the textboxes. p  pHeres an example of what I mean.

Negative 72257 pcurrently I work on a role where we need to strip down features of the software. The company I work for decided to use different branches I suggested feature toggle as the software is modular but they want branches. p  pSo we got our develop branch. Now we created branch A for client A. Branch A should contain all features of the software and they recommended we strip develop branch so that we can deploy a stripped version for client B.p  pI find the above problematic as it wont be easy to merge fixes to A again. So I recommended we have develop, A and B branches. Develop is our single source of truth with all features. B is stripped down.p  pIs there a better approachp

When they have cell comments, the comments stay behind and are assigned to rows that are shifted to the deleted rows place, which is not what I want.p  pSame is the case when I need to delete only one row and that happens to be the last row.  In that case, my code does not shift the rows since it is the last row. p  pI am aware of the fact that using removeRow does not delete the row, as happens when we right click on an excel row and choose delete, and instead clears the row of data as happens when we choose a row in excel and click on the delete keyboard button. I also noticed that the latter action also does not clear cell comments.p  pI would like to know if anyone else had noticed this issue and what was your fix for it. I can parse through all the cells in the row that I want to delete and remove cell comments if they are present, but I do not want to do this. p

Negative 72257 pHey guys so Ill cut this short. A few weeks ago I started learning the programming language C. I have knowledge in web technologies like HMTLCSS, Javscript, PHP, and basic server administration. However this C language is just confusing as hell To my understanding the C language does not have a data type for strings just characters, however I may be wrong. So this is my question regarding string in C. p  pQuestion I have heard there are two ways of declaring a string. What is the difference between these two lines of declaring a string    a. char stringName[]    b. char stringNamep  pI get that char stringName[] is an array of characters. However the second line confuses me. To my understanding the second line makes a pointer variable. Arent pointer variables supposed to be the memory address of another variable If someone can clarify this for me it would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 72257 pI am developing a remote control via sms for my phone, and am wondering how to make and html document an sms. I am wanting to do this because the phone finder I set up replies with geographical coordinates, which isnt entirely useful to the average person, so I used the google maps library to attach an image of the map of the geographical coordinates... The problem Im encountering is that it displays the image in a url, which is not helpful if the phone Im locating mine with doesnt have data or a browser to view this with, or it makes an , or the equivalent in other languages, but with no document to put this in it just returns errors. Is there any way to get around this or make the sms an html document Thank you for your time and help. p

Negative 72257 pMy backend right now its a wellmodularized directory structure and its a RESTful API server. Im using Hapi.p  pThe problem that Im facing is that I need to create another backend project and Id like to reuse all the common functionality between the 2 projects, Id like to reuse the same code base, the same scaffold.p  pI have two solutionsp  ul lipCreate a separate git repository for the new project and just copy the directory structure. The main problem with this approach is that Im duplicating code. If I need to modify this common code base, I need to modify 2 projects, and this is a maintenance nightmare.pli lipUse the same git repository for both projects. Luckily, Hapi has the concept of a connection. Each connection its bound to a different socket and has its own routes and stuff, so its very easy to just configure a different connection for the other server. During the bootup I could choose which connection to use, an approach similar to thisp  pre  NODEENVdevelopment node server.js connection mobile    NODEENVdevelopment node server.js connection web pre  pThis is the most cleaner and elegant way to accomplish my objective, but it has a major disavantage for me, git flow, because Im not an expert on this field. Id need to maintain 3 branches codebasecode, codemobilecode and codewebcode. Depending on which branch you are, you see different files. For examplep  pre .    base      common.js    mobile      file1.js    web     file2.js pre  pIf the current branch is codemobilecode, youll see the codebasecode and the codemobilecode directories.br If the current branch is codewebcode, youll see the codebasecode and the codewebcode directories.br If the current branch is codebasecode, youll see the codebasecode directory.p  pFrom a point of view of software versioning is this acceptable When deploying to production I simply to push the branch Id like to upload and on the remote server checkout to that branch and start the server. For examplep  pTo start the strongmobilestrong serverp  pemlocalemp  pre  git push productionserver mobile pre  pemproduction serveremp  pre  git checkout mobile  NODEENVproduction node server.js connection mobile pre  pTo start the strongwebstrong serverp  pemlocalemp  pre  git push productionserver web pre  pemproduction serveremp  pre  git checkout web  NODEENVproduction node server.js connection web pre  pSo far, so good. Now suppose that I need to modify the base and apply the changes to the branches codemobilecode and codewebcode. Ive been reading this article, a hrefhttpswww.atlassian.comgittutorialsmergingvsrebasing relnofollowmerge vs rebasea and doing some tests, and Ive seen in SourceTree that rebasing is just what I need. Visually its more cleaner and conceptually its ok, rebasing codebasecode into codemobilecode and codewebcode just updates them to the lastest codebasecode changes.p  pWith this approach theres no codemastercode branch, instead theres a codebasecode branch and codemobilecode and codewebcode are strongneverstrong merged into codebasecode.pli ul  pWhat do you think I like the second approach as long as all the team members stick to the rules. Ill be the responsible to review all the pull requests to the remote repository, so I can verify that all the changes are ok.p

Negative 72257 pI have a static library that is linked to IPP 7.1 for 4 calls to codeippiMulcode. The project is built in Visual Studio. This was previously a dynamic link, but it turns out that in IPP 7.1 dynamic libraries are internally multithreaded, which is disallowed for me, so I changed it to a static link to singlethreaded IPP. The size of the lib then increased from several MB to about 150MB.p  pIs this normal for such a link I am only calling one function from IPP, as I said.p  pIn the latest IPP 8.2 a hrefhttpssoftware.intel.comenusnode503931 relnofollowmultithreading is deprecateda, so updating would solve the problem for me. However I am still intrigued by this. If I am only using a single function from the library, wouldnt static linking be a more correct option And is such an inflation of the lib size to be expectedp

Our application will have several editors, each with its own model. p  pThe view will look like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqBcpu.png altOverviewp  pEach editor has its own modelviewmodelmodel. The parent views which holds all sub editors model contains the data from which all sub editors can be feeded.p  pSince the user should be able to save its current state at any time, we need to be able to validate the existing data as well because the user might have entered invalid data. So we need the validation in two placesp  ul liwhen the user enters datali liwhen the data is loaded again after starting the applicationli ul  pSince we do not want to convert the data into each sub editor model just to get the validation result, the parent model should be able to be validated as well.p  pThe only way I found to achieve this, is to introduce interfaces which basically describes the structure of the data within the class which is to be validated.

Negative 72257 pI need help with twitters typeahead. Im also open to using any other autocomplete that works with knockout. For example these look nice just not sure if they can do what I need a hrefhttpsgithub.comrniemeyerknockoutjqAutocomplete relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrniemeyerknockoutjqAutocompletea and a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.compackageknockout.autocomplete relnofollowhttpswww.npmjs.compackageknockout.autocompleteap  pstrongBackground Infostrongbr I have JSON data coming from backend and this is used to autocomplete on in an input field. Lets say it looks like the following p  precode[    NameJohn Smith    Id23  ,      NameJane Doe    Id298  ,   ] codepre  pI do autocomplete on the name field and send back to the server the name and id of the selection or entered text when the input field loses focus or when user uses the submit buttonp  pSo here is my scenario. I have 3 cases for autocomplete  p  ol lipUser selects a name from suggestions and then sends the name and id for that selection back to serverpli lipUser types in input field and no option is available from autocomplete so user types a new name that is not in the options that autocomplete knows about. In this case, when input field loses focus, it sends to the back end the new name and an id of 1 and makes autocompletetypeahead pull the new data from the backend bc it needs to know what the id of the newly created name is so that future autocomplete requests can be done on itpli lipUser types in a name that appears in suggestions from autocomplete, but the user doesnt select the name from the options instead it keeps typing the name out. This is equivalent to selecting the name except that it doesnt trigger the selected event so I dont know the id for that name unless I go through all the names and check if they match but dont know how to get the array of options that twitters typeahead is using for autocomplete so I need to make another request to the server so this wont work.pli ol  pstrongQuestionstrongbr Ive been able to do case 1 and 2 with twitters typeahead and no knockout. How would I implement case 3 I used to check on the backend that the name sent from front end is not in the database, so this was a name comparison  thing is Id need to index the names column. Id prefer to do a check by id, but Im open to suggestions. Im also open to changing the design from autocompletetypeahead to something else that deals with my 3 cases.p

Negative 72257 pI have a database table that is basically a firstinfirstout queue. Rows are simply inserted into the table by other parts of the system and forgotten about. Every 5 minutes, a job runs to process items from the queue. Each row to be processed has its status field changed from a pending value to a processing value. Subsequent duplicates in the queue are matched up and marked as the duplicate of an earlier queued item that is being processed. The queue processor job is the only thing that does anything with the table, apart from the parts of the system which just blindly insert rows.p  pThis is exactly what the processor does with the queuep  precodeSTART TRANSACTION  SELECT id FROM apiqueue WHERE statusstatusprocessing   Application checks this result set is empty, then...  UPDATE apiqueue qs INNER JOIN apiqueue qdupes ON qdupes.productsidqs.productsid AND qdupes.actionqs.action SET qdupes.status  IFqs.idqdupes.id, statusprocessing, statusprocessingduplicate WHERE qs.id IN queueids   COMMIT   Each queue item is processed   Once processing is complete, we purge the queue  START TRANSACTION  SELECT COUNT AS total FROM apiqueue WHERE status  statusprocessing    Application sanity checks the number of processing items its about to delete against how many its processed, and then...  DELETE FROM apiqueue WHERE status IN statusprocessing, statusprocessingduplicate   COMMIT codepre  pIn a typical 5 minutes, the queue will build up a backlog of about 100 items, though occasionally it can be in the thousands if a lot of changes have occurred in the catalog.p  pThe first transaction is typically pretty fast when it doesnt hit a deadlock 0.1  0.2 seconds to complete, but it does seem to hit deadlocks about 10 of the time.p  pWhy does it hit deadlocks so often Even if a transaction locks all the rows currently in a table, should I expect this to cause contention when new rows are added to the table If so, why is thatp  pIve also noticed that sometimes the first transaction above containing the codeUPDATEcode query doesnt appear to actually apply at all  though I think this may well be an unrelated bug.p  pMy queue table looks like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS apiqueue    id int11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,   productsid int11 NOT NULL,   action tinyint3 NOT NULL,   triggeredby tinyint3 NOT NULL,   status tinyint1 NOT NULL  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf8  codepre

Negative 72257 pI am trying to use EditorFor to enter values into a list within a view model. I dont want every element in the list to allow edits though. The method of determining which element in the list can be edited is by using an additional list in my view model. The two lists line up perfectly so at the ith position of one list exactly corresponds to the ith position of the other. The code is as followsp  precodeltdiv classformgroupgt         Html.LabelInputs, htmlAttributes new  class  controllabel colmd2          ltdiv classcolmd10gt             for int i  0 i lt Model.InputList.Count i                              Html.Labeli  1     Model.ProtocolSteps[i].Description                 if Model.ProtocolSteps[i].InputNeeded.Value                                      Html.EditorFormodel gt model.InputList[i], new  htmlAttributes  new  class  formcontrol                                    ltbr gt                      ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre  pThe ProtocolSteps list determines if an editorfor template should be displayed. If it should, the editorfor input is stored into the InputList. This code works perfectly without the if statement i.e. all values are stored to the correct location in InputList. With the if statement, the view is displayed perfectly, but values are not stored into InputList usually one value is stored into the list, but not all. Any help is appreciated with why the if statement is messing things up.p

Negative 72257 pIm new to android, but in the interest of practicing and learning more I wanted to try to make a practice application that essentially allows the user to only be logged on within the minute that they first logged in. So in other words if you log in at 1023, the user will be logged out as soon as the clock strikes 1024. To do this, I log in via my codeLoginActivitycode I share the current minute in a codeSharedPreferencescode object. In the interest of making use of the codeonResumecode method in my codeAppActivitycode, my application first opens the main activity,codeAppActivitycode, which then opens my codeLoginActivitycode in the codeonCreatecode method of my codeAppActivitycode class.  Hopefully without being too redundant in my explanation, the goal is to call codesessionCheckerAsyncTask.executecode in the codeonResumecode method of my codeAppActivitycode.p  pHeres my login button found in codeLoginActivitycodep  precodeloginbutton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v               int result  getTime              SharedPreferences pref  getSharedPreferencesPREF, MODEPRIVATE             SharedPreferences.Editor editor  pref.edit             editor.putIntSESSION, result             editor.commit              finish               codepre  pwith helper method codegetTimecode seen herep  precodeprivate int getTime          Calendar time  Calendar.getInstance         return time.getCalendar.MINUTE      codepre  pAs you can see Im simply storing the current minute in a codeSharedPreferencescode object via my login button. Now from here, I wanted to create an codeAsyncTaskcode in my codeAppActivitycode class that checks every 500ms .5 seconds if my current minute in codeAppActivitycode matches the minute that was stored in my codeSharedPreferencescode object, if not I want to essentially log the user out and send them back to the codeLoginActivitycode.p  pMy issue is, Im a bit confused about the types that I should be implementing in my codeAsyncTaskcode for my codedoInBackgroundcode and codeonPostExecutecode methods. Also do I need the codeonCancelledcode method, and would implementing it perhaps be useful for configuration changes within codeAppActivitycode  As of now Im thinking that I should set it up something like thisp  precodeprivate class SessionCheckerTask extends AsyncTaskltInteger, Void, Booleangt              Override         protected Boolean doInBackgroundInteger... minuteinSharedPreferences              Create a thread that refreshes every 500ms that checks current time              return false if the current time doesnt match the time in shared preferences                   Override         protected void onPostExecuteBoolean aBoolean              super.onPostExecuteaBoolean                               If false was returned create a toast that says Activity session has expired                 then open the login activity again                             codepre  pBut then Im also thinking that it shouldnt be necessary for codedoInBackgroundcode to have a type at all. Instead codeonPostExecutecode should only be called if the minute passed in codedoInBackgroundcode doesnt match the current minute, but Im not sure how to implement this in the typical codeAsyncTaskcode format.p

Negative 72257 h2tldrh2  pEven if you implement master election with one of the registries such as Zookeeper, Consul, or etcd, there always seems to be a race condition where an old master does not realize it is no longer master and tries to write, while a new master is unblocked from writing, resulting in two instances of the service writing at the same time, which we want to avoid. How can we implement master election without this race conditionp  h2Detailed problem statementh2  pSuppose we want to implement master election for failover using one of the registries such as Zookeeper, Consul, or etcd.p  pSuppose there are three instances of the service S1, S2, S3, each one with a corresponding registry node on the same machine, and currently S1 is master and S2 and S3 are slaves. p  pFurthermore, S1, S2, S3 all store shared state in the registry, but we do not want to have multiple instances write that state at the same time because concurrent access might make the state inconsistent.p  pSuppose S1 is in the middle of write operations to the shared state stored in the registry. That is, it will execute more write operations before checking again whether it is leader.p  pSuppose there is a network partition at this point. On one partition is S1. On the other partition is S2 and S3, so it has the quorum.p  pThe registry correctly identifies S2 as the new leader and invalidates S1 as the leader. p  pS2 activates because it is the new leader and begins a series of write operations to the shared state stored in the registry.p  pThe partition is healed.p  pAt this point both S1 and S2 will execute write operations to the registry concurrently and both their write operations will succeed since the partition is healed, which might result in inconsistent state.p  pThe sample trace isp  ol liS1 is notified it is master, and begins write operations to shared state in registryli liPartition happens, with S1 in one partition, S2 amp S3 in the otherli liS2 is identified as new masterli liS2 is notified it is new master, and begins write operations to shared state in registryli liPartition is repairedli liS1 writes to shared state in registry and succeeds since no partitionli liS2 writes to shared state in registry and succeeds also, causing arbitrary interleaving of writes with S1li liS1 is notified it is no longer master and stops writingli ol  h1Thoughtsh1  ul liThinking in terms of Consuls sessions, would an API write call that also takes a session ID and only succeeds if that session ID is still masters solve this problemli liIs there such a call in Consul or one of the other registriesli ul

Can someone point me to the right direction Right now I havep  precode             function search                    var termsearch.val                    ifterm                     result.htmlltimg srcimgspin.gif stylemargintop 30pxgt                      .ajax                         typepost,                         urlfile.php,                         dataqencodeURIComponentterm,  encodeURI is used to escape things such as plus sign                          successfunctiondata                             result.htmldata                             search.val                                                                     codepre  pSo, basically I figure the text is sent through the post variable q. Lets say I have an array of checkboxes, how can I add that to the same post requestp
Negative 72257 pI am making a tic tac toe game where the game board is made up of an array filled with s. p  pThe problem I am encountering is I tried to make a function that would allow the user to enter where they would want to put their character, but it seems that I cant change the value of the array that the tic tac board is stored in, I am trying to use a reference variable but it keeps giving me an error.p  pThe game is fully functional now, because I just decided to not make it a function, but it would be nice if I knew how to change the value of an array via passing the array into a function.p  pExample of what didnt workp  precode  include stdafx.h include ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt  using namespace std void gameBoard void drawGameBoardstring row1[], string row2[], string row3[] void playerInputstring xOrO, string row1[], string row2[], string row3[]  const int MAXLENGTH  9  int main      gameBoard     return 0   void gameBoard      string row1[]   , , , , , , , ,       string row2[]   , , , , , , , ,       string row3[]   , , , , , , , ,        drawGameBoardrow1, row2, row3     playerInputX, row1, row2, row3     drawGameBoardrow1, row2, row3   void drawGameBoardstring row1[], string row2[], string row3[]      cout ltlt endl     for int i  0 i lt MAXLENGTH i              cout ltlt row1[i]          cout ltlt endl     for int i  0 i lt MAXLENGTH i              cout ltlt row2[i]          cout ltlt endl     for int i  0 i lt MAXLENGTH i              cout ltlt row3[i]          cout ltlt endl     cout ltlt endl   void playerInput string xOrO, string row1[], string row2[], string row3[]      row1[1]  xOrO  codepre
Negative 72257 pI want to use codeTwiliocodes codeSMScode and Recorded Voice services, which allow users to send USSD code to update certain object fields on their entry in codeparse.comcode s database. Also other users should be able to send different codeUSSDcode code to retrieve very basic information using cloud code. I would like to implement this in two ways  send codeUSSDcode code and receive info written directly  Recorded Sound System that helps the user get what heshe needs, similar to the voice service provided by communication companies. p  pThe problem is that I dont know what are the technical names of the specific servicescodeREST APIscode I need to get this done.

Negative 72257 pI am working on an Android application in which I am trying to integrate Navigation Drawer. Now, the project is divided into 2 parts, one is Users and one is Restaurants. Both are different projects, so both have different APK and all.  Now, the drawer for User works just fine. I used the same code for the Restaurant, and it is throwing me an error. i have no idea why. So basically, I created a Drawer Layout activity and extended activity in that class. And whereever I want a drawer, I am extending the DrawerLayoutActivity class, instead of normal activity, and adding the list and android drawer layout in XML. It worked in User.

Negative 72257 pIm beginning with command line building of my libraries. Im used to use IDEs on Windows.p  pI want to use MSYS Bash to call build tools to build my libraries in C. Say I have 100 of distinct libraries which have no relation to each other and many are built for different platforms. What is the easiest way to build themp  pI use Windows and MSYS Bash but preferably the approach should be platform agnostic. The naive and time consuming way would be start bash, cd to my library folder, set PATH variable to point to actual build tools to be used in my case GCC ARM, MinGW, ... and call make. And then again for each library.p  pI would prefere just to clickcall something which has already defined the folder where the library resides and build tools to be used. Is it possiblep

Negative 72257 pIm writing an application where it is important to be able to find out in real time whether a specific user identified by a socket id is currently connected to any machine inside the cluster or not... p  pHowever, this does not seem possible in the general case an easy implementation would only work unreliably. p  pFor example, lets say a two users are connected to two different servers A and B and chatting with one another using socket.io redis adapter, and suddenly server A goes down. Further, for whatever reason, the user connected to server A fails to reconnect to server B. Server B has no easy way to tell that server A has gone down and that its users have been disconnected. The user connected to server B therefore will not know that his partner cannot get his messages.p  pIs there any strategy to help in this case Maybe have the servers poll each other every few seconds to make sure they are alive Implement some kind of heartbeat function to make sure users are alive which would not be easy to implement at all in the general case Any clues as to how to proceed Thanksp
