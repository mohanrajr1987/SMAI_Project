Positive 92859 pSo heres my problem. I am currently trying to create a rectangular enclosure using four more rectangles as borders. So it would look somewhat like this. Keep in mind each side is individual so a rectangle with a border wouldnt work.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comftqcr.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comftqcr.png altenter image description hereap  pNow the actual problem comes with different screen sizes. Specifically the 4s. Since the screen is emshorterem than other phones, how would I resize the rectangles on the side to fit the height One of my options was detect the screen size, and then set the height of the rectangle, but I was wondering if there was an easier way since Id also have to deal with all the other screens. p

Positive 92859 pSo I have this sprite kit game, which is coded in swift 2. The game includes these colored circles Green, Red, Purple, Yellow, Blue that fall down the screen, starting from the same height, but starting at different widths. When the circles hit the bottom of the screen, the respectable method is called. The problem I am having is, the random x position can sometimes cut half of the circle off because it is on the very side of the screen. How can I prevent the circles from clipping the side of the screen Here are the methods that are called when the circles hit the bottom of the screen.p  precode    func changeGreen      Green.position.y  frame.size.height  0.9      let PositionX  arc4randomuniformUInt32self.frame.width      Green.position.x  CGFloatPositionX    func changeRed      Red.position.y  frame.size.height  0.9      let PositionX  arc4randomuniformUInt32self.frame.width      Red.position.x  CGFloatPositionX    func changeBlue         Blue.position.y  frame.size.height  0.9      let PositionX  arc4randomuniformUInt32self.frame.width      Blue.position.x  CGFloatPositionX    func changeYellow       Yellow.position.y  frame.size.height  0.9      let PositionX  arc4randomuniformUInt32self.frame.width      Yellow.position.x  CGFloatPositionX    func changePurple       Purple.position.y  frame.size.height  0.9      let PositionX  arc4randomuniformUInt32self.frame.width      Purple.position.x  CGFloatPositionX   codepre

Positive 92859 pWe have a simple game that has a main codeGameScenecode of codeSKScenecode type. The codeGameScenecode creates a model object called codeGameEngineModelcode.  p  pIt also stores a reference as delegate for communication. For example, if the score is changed in the codeGameEngineModelcode it calls a delegate method on the Scene to update the HUD.  p  pI would like all the game logic, including creation of sprites on the screen to be completed in the codeGameEngineModelcode. Previously we called this method to spawn some sprites on the screen.  p  precodefunc spawnGameIconsLoop       Run the main actions on loop     runActionSKAction.repeatActionForever         SKAction.sequence[             SKAction.runBlockaddCircleIcon,             SKAction.waitForDurationspawnRate             ]           codepre  pWe would like to move this logic to the codeGameEngineModelcode, the issue is that this is of no class so runAction is not available here.   p  pHow could we control the game logic outside of the scene here. As a note, the codespawnRatecode would change from time to time, so if this codeSKActioncode is created with a an initial codewaitForDurationcode, how can we amend that once the level changes and the spawnRate changes p

Positive 92859 pI have been playing around trying to learn spritekit in xcode7. So far I have a level that is larger than the screen, a hero the I can move around and a camera that follows the hero as he moves off the the viewable screen area.

That means if I move it to the bottom, as soon as my hero walks up the joystick and buttons will be off the screen.p  pCan anyone please provide any direction on how I can add huds to spritekit that are always at the top and bottom of the viewable area, while still allowing the hero to move around the levelp

Positive 92859 pSince SpriteKit does not allow the adjustments of specific variables, specifically the velocity threshold, I am forced to include Box2d myself and create the things I need. In sprite kit, they have a very nice function to take a CGPath and turn it into a physics body      code[SKPhysicsBody bodyWithEdgeChainFromPathnonnull CGPathRefgt]code. Is there any way I could do this same functionality with Box2d itselfp  pstrongSo farstrong, I have created a circle with a CGPath usingp  pcodeCGPathAddArcpath, NULL, 0, 0, 75, degreesToRadians360, degreesToRadians0, truecodep  pMy initial though was to loop through the points that the CGPath has and just use those as vertices for the Box2d version. This was an issue because it seems that a CGPath are along the lines of commands. With my path above, there are only four elements which are composed of setting the start point and then curving around the circle.p  pI have been able to just create a circle for Box2d by defining the number of vertices I want, the center point, and the radius. This works fine but is not really what I am looking for because it poses two problems. The first is that I will have many different shapes most of them will be complex polygons which will be very tedious to create for every shape. The second is that the line width is more than one pixel. This means that objects go through the border of the circle and only hit the middle of the borders. I can solve this by creating two bodies, one around the inside of the line and the other on the outside. This makes the process tedious2.p  pstrongNotestrongp  pThe circle is hollow thats why I cant just create the object as a circle. Also, it will be many different objects, this is just an example.p

Negative 92859 pIm trying to create a horizontal 100 stackedbar graph using HTML and CSS. Id like to create the bars using DIVs with background colors and percentage widths depending on the values I want to graph. I also want to have a grid lines to mark an arbitrary position along the graph.p  pIn my experimentation, Ive already gotten the bars to stack horizontally by assigning the css property float left. However, Id like to avoid that, as it really seems to mess with the layout in confusing ways. Also, the grid lines dont seem to work very well when the bars are floated.p  pI think that CSS positioning should be able to handle this, but I dont yet know how to do it.

Negative 92859 pWhen implementing texture mapping on a standard polygonal mesh using the usual algorithm, you can run into issues related to deformations along the yaxis in that the deformations follow along bands of constant height rows of quads instead of the vertices in this direction being able to stretch independently compared to that along the xaxis.p  pIm running into this because when defining the vertices of the mesh, each row defines both a bottom and a top vertex, resulting in the top row of vertices for one row sharing the bottom row of vertices for the row above it.p  pWhile this is ok if youre only deforming the mesh along either the x or z axes, if you deform the mesh along the yaxis without taking this into account, you will see that the rows of quads act together as a band of constant height instead of rows of independent points.  You will see deformation of the mesh along the yaxis, but you will also see texture tearing as these bands do not change in width, leading to gaps in the mesh.p  pHas anyone else run into this who would have suggestions on how best to apply an x,y displacement map filter to a polygonal mesh constructed in this fashion  Or does the approach to defining the mesh have to change in some fundamental wayp  pAn example of the mesh generation algorithm can be seen on a hrefhttpwww.zeuscmd.comtutorialsopengles21WavingFlag.php relnofollowZEUS OpenGLES Tutorial on Texture Mappinga.p  pThanks.p

Negative 92859 pA web application we wrote intended for one customer is going to be productized and sold to dozens of companies, and we will be doing the hosting.p  pI could use some guidance about the pros and cons of rolling out a seperate instance for each customer versus going with a single or very small number of multitenant instances. p  pAt first, as we ramp up, I will emhaveem to roll out a seperate instance of the application for each new customer they will come online one at a time because its the only immediate option.

Negative 92859 pI am trying to create an application which allows background threads to update core data objects while the user might be reading the same data.p  pMy approach to this would be to use multiple NSManagedObjectContexts and then before a background thread does a codesavecode operation, I fetch the object the user is currently working on and fire the fault for all its properties and relationships recursively. This way I have all objects the user could act with in my NSManagedObjectContext without seeing the already updated values.p  pBut this can only work if the NSManagedObjectContext cannot decide himself that e.g. memory usage is too high, and starts faulting objects which I do not explicitly reference other than through the NSManagedObject relationship.p  pSo the question is, can the NSManagedObjectContext decide that an object needs to be refaulted, without intervention from my sidep  pThanks for your effort, Markusp

Negative 92859 pFor a product we are creating, we want to be able to have the welcome screen display in a perspective which we are calling Start Here. The intro is the only thing that needs to be in that perspective, however, when I try to add our intro view to the perspective, it says that the view already exists in the layout.p  pI have tried programmatically closing the intro, messing around with standby mode etc but I cant get it working.p  pThe intro is an XHTML one and we use internal Eclipse action links e.g. a hrefhttporg.eclipse...runAction relnofollowhttporg.eclipse...runActiona etc extensively hence the reason that we need to use the intro framework.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas as to how I could get it added to a perspective, or at the very least get the intro fully maximised when you select a specific perspective using the showIntro method results in it displaying oddly, bunched to one side.p  pThanksp

Negative 92859 pLets say that I have the methodInfo for something like codeNullableltintgt.HasValuecode. Is there anyway to convert it to codeNullableltstringgt.HasValuecodep  pI know for a regular generic method I can do codemethodInfo.GetGenericMethodcode but I dont see a way to do it for the type from the method, without doing more reflection overhead. If I already have the method why do I have to reflect againp  pInterestingly enough the methods all have the same codeMetadataTokencode, which makes it more impressive that somehow Module.ResolveMember seems to pull the right one out. p  pIs there any way to do this with the codeModule.ResolveMethodcode Essentially, the method and type may both have generic parameters, and I may need to switch them. Since the MethodInfo always says its token is the same and the token represents the MethodInfo is the most open version of the method. I just need someway for it to be converted to my type.p  pEdit More digging, it appears that for something like codeListltTgt.Addcode, codeListltintgt.Addcode metadata token from which i retrieve is actually living in my module, while the generic definition lives in a different module. p  pI really dont want to do reflection once I retrieve the member once, as its very difficult to resolve the exact same method being invoked. p  pOkay maybe Im just stupid, but why exactly does this not workp  precodevar methodinfo  typeofListltintgt.GetMethodAdd var handle  methodinfo.MetaDataToken var methodinfo2  methodinfo.Module.ResolveMethodhandle,new []typeofstring,null codepre  pWhy does methodInfo2 say that it is codeAddTcode rather than codeAddstringcodep

But I also wanted the service to refresh the activity when it was done. I wasnt able to do that. My current approach seems to work, but not as smoothly on 3G. Activity A shows a Loading box, then launches activity B and destroys itself. Activity B also shows a loading box, does the downloading, then destroys itself and relaunches activity A with the new content. However, this last approach makes the screen go black for a few seconds in transition from A to B when on 3G. p  pFor the sake of visual smoothness, Id like one loading popup to display continuously. When done, the activity should be refreshed.p  pDoes anyone know how I can achieve this p  pI hope my explanation was clear enough.

Negative 92859 pIm developing a website that will use Cassandra for database storage and Solr to index and search some of the data contained in that database only some of the data do I want searchable. I had intended to use PHP for serverside scripting, interfacing with the Cassandra database, and providing dynamic HTML content based on the contents of the database.p  pWhen a user commits something to the database, I envisioned PHP issuing the write to Cassandra, and if it were data that needed to be searched, that same data could be written to the Solr index. The thing is, I dont necessarily need the searchable data immediately available in the Solr index, nor do I want the process of adding it to the index through PHP consuming valuable resources, especially during peak traffic hours. Is there a way to have asynchronous updates to the Solr index occur in the background by transferring the data directly from Cassandra Perhaps a queue of searchable data could be created that is used to update the Solr index during idle time by some background processp  pIm new to this whole thing, but Id somehow like the link between Cassandra and Solr be insulated from the main PHP scripts. Not sure if Cassandra and Solr can be linked efficiently by Java, with only the higherlevel access to both Cassandra for readingwriting to the database and Solr for querying the searchable data be maintained in PHP for web content creation. I appreciate any suggestions.p

Negative 92859 pI recently designed my own user control.p  pMy control consists of an ASPTree control and a plain HTML text input with copious Javascript, jQuery, and .net code to bring them to life together.p  pI have two issues.p  p1 I can only have one instance of this control on a page at a time.  The text input is named txtUserControl, so putting a second instance on the page causes a name collision.  I have the same issue with the ASPTree.p  p2 If I put my user control inside an ASPUpdatePanel, it does not work at all.  I get errors all over the page when I try to refresh it.  Incidently, I have this same issue with a user control created by one of my coworkers.p  pI have some ideas for controls that I would like to be able to use again and again in my projects.

Negative 92859 pI took a look into the iso images ISO 9660 of small Linux distributions. I found 16 empty sectors, followed by a sector describing the Primary Volume Description. Next sector is commonly a Boot Record containing only descriptive information such as System and Version Identifier and a little endian integer inside the unspecified byterange. Then comes the Supplementary Volume Descriptor and finally the Volume Descriptor Set Terminator.p  pI only guess its a little endian integer in the Boot Record. I found no more Information about this. In all the images I used was the little endian integer smaller than the value for Sector Count from the Primary Volume Descriptor, so I further guess its pointing to a sector inside the Image.

Negative 92859 pI think serviceapplication layer is the same thing as Larman describes as GRASP Controller, being the first object beyond the GUI layer that delegates to the domain layer, and should be reusable from different GUI.p  pService Evans layer is the same as Application Fowler layer because Fowler himself says so, in his bliki about the Anemic Domain Model a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comblikiAnemicDomainModel.html relnofollowhttpmartinfowler.comblikiAnemicDomainModel.htmlap  pQuote Application Layer [his name for Service Layer] Defines the jobs the software is supposed to do and directs the expressive domain objects to work out problems. The tasks this layer is responsible for are meaningful to the business or necessary for interaction with the application layers of other systems. This layer is kept thin. It does not contain business rules or knowledge, but only coordinates tasks and delegates work to collaborations of domain objects in the next layer down. It does not have state reflecting the business situation, but it can have state that reflects the progress of a task for the user or the program.p  pNow consider the above description and also see fowlers PEAA book, regarding identifying service layer methods from the use cases and also consider the picture in Fowlers description of Service layer that illustrates the Service Layer being the first layer after the user interface at this URL a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comeaaCatalogserviceLayer.html relnofollowhttpmartinfowler.comeaaCatalogserviceLayer.htmlap  pNow compare the above mentioned ServiceApplication layer description with some of Larmans words about the GRASP Controller in the 3rd edition of his bestselling OOAD book Aplying UML and patterns, age 302306  ...first object beyond the UI layer that receives and coordinates controls a system operation... ...represents a use case scenario within which the system event occurs... ... Normally, a controller should delegate to other objects the work that needs to be done it coordinates or controls the activity. It does not do much work itself....p  pI think that Larmans GRASP Controller layer is the same as EvansFowlers ApplicationService layer. Do other people disagree  Then please explain the significant differences between these concepts, and some example  of Controller class instead of ServiceApplication class.p  pMy question is born because some say that the creation of model domain objects is the responsibility of the controller, instead of the other service  application layer. But could you give me an example of service layer class and the difference between controller class p

Negative 92859 pI have searched high and low for a solution to this problem, and while I found one question, I have found zero responses.  Ill lay out the entire situation because maybe theres a solution Im not seeing...p  pI have an HTML file loaded on to the users SD card.  Im loading that HTML file into a WebView using WebView.loadURL....  This works fine.  That HTML imports external Javascript files like sop  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery1.3.2.min.js gt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsinPracticeutilities.js gt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsinPractice.js gt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsmobileinpractice.ipad.js gt codepre  pOf course, this does not work because after SDK 1.0, the ability load this external code was deemed a security issue or at least thats how I understood it.  I changed each HTML file there are hundreds to use inline Javascript, and all works fine.p  pEach HTML file has links that call Javascript methods using their onClick event.p  precodelta hrefdrug onclickreturn contentdrug, nameTamoxifen, pageId9475b30a5a8b04faf9757fcaeaa0a2cfgtTamoxifenltagt codepre  pAs you can see, the javascript method, content, is called when the user clicks on this link.  This also works fine.p  pHowever, some files have links to supporting assets, which are essentially separate HTML pages themselves, except without the actual page.  Heres an examplep  precodelta hrefsupportingAsset onclickreturn contentsupportingAsset, htmlltdiv classsupportingAssetgtltpgtlta hrefdrug onclickreturn contentdrug, nameTamoxifen, pageId9475b30a5a8b04faf9757fcaeaa0a2cfgtTamoxifenltagtgtSupporting Assetltagt codepre  pNote, there may be some syntax issues in my recreation, but I promise the syntax is all correct in the actual code.p  pSo, the issue here is that the supporting asset HTML is included as a parameter to the call to Javascript method content.  In order to display this content when the user clicks on the supporting asset, I use...p  precodewebView.loadDataWithBaseURLfile  baseLocation, html, texthtml, utf8, null codepre  p...where html is the HTML passed into the Javascript method, content.  This new page is displaying fine, BUT...if you notice in the supporting asset content, there is ANOTHER link that calls out to the Javascript method, content.  This is where the problem lies...p  pIve tried appending...p  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery1.3.2.min.js gt codepre  p...to the raw HTML before loading it into the webview. Nothing.p  pIve tried appending the inline Javascript method. Nothing.p  pIve tried adding the Javascript method after pageLoad...p  precode    Override     public void onPageFinishedWebView view, String url          if loadingPageDialog  null              loadingPageDialog.dismiss                   view.loadUrljavascriptfunction contentpath, params                      document.getElementsByTagNamebody[0].style.color  red                     codepre  p...Nothing.p  pbActual Questionbp  pDoes anyone know of a way I can inject the Javascript method content, such that the existing call to content works  Note, I cant change the call to content, and the webview that displays the supporting asset content is in a separate activity from the original webview. p

Negative 92859 pIm making an application that displays an FFT of sound data from a microphone. One thing I need to be able to support is calibrating to the frequency response of the microphone, which will be given to the program via a calibration file. The calibration file contains  or  dB values for different frequencies, like thisp  precode20 2.7 50 0.5 100 0.7 135 0.7 190 1.4 250 1 370 0.9 550 1 700 0.6 1000 0.5 1500 0.4 2000 0.5 2800 0.6 2900 0.4 3000 0.5 4000 0.2 4300 0.2 5600 0.7 6150 0.6 12000 3.5 13000 3.5 20000 1.5 codepre  pI can just apply the calibration after the FFT and before displaying it on the screen.p  pMy problem is this how should I interpolate between those values, which are essentially just select points of the whole frequency response of the microphone A naive approach might be to define rigid rectangular bands around those points and, for each frequency in an FFT, pick one or another calibration line to apply to that frequency. This would cause visible jumps in the FFT graph, however. Another solution might be to use linear interpolation, but Im still not sure thats the best way.p  pIs there a standard way to do this, that programs like Smaart or FFT devices do What would be the best way to generate a continuous curve from those few fixed pointsp

Negative 92859 pI am creating an HTML5 app for the iPad that needs to cache XML file for offline use.  In the manifest I list all of my html, js, css, images, and the XML files. p  pCurrently, the method I am using works on Chrome, Desktop Safari, and Firefox all the desktop browsers Ive tried, however the data is not cached properly on the iPad.p  pWhen the files in the manifest are cached, all of the XML files are requested from the server, but when I put the iPad offline to test the storage, the html, images, and other files work, but the XML files are not present. There is not enough files that this would be hitting the 5MB limit.  p  pI tried searching the apple developer documents, but couldnt find any information, and other problems that I found people had with the iPad offline caching were related to the size limit, or caching nothing at all.

Negative 92859 pI have a winsock IOCP server written in c using TCP IP connections.  I have tested this server locally, using the loopback address with a client simulator.  I have been able to get upwards of 60,000 clients no sweat.  The issue I am having, is when I run the server at my house and the client simulator at a friends house.  Everything works fine up until we hit around 3700 connections, after that every call to connect fails from the client side with a return of 10060 this is the winsock timed out error.  Last night this number was 3700, but it has been around 300 before, and we also saw it near 1000.  But whatever the number is, every time we try to simulate it, it will fail right around that number within 10 or so.p  pBoth computers are using Windows 7 Ultimate.  We have also both modified the TCPIP registry setting MaxTcpConnections to around 16 million.  We also changed the MaxUserPort setting from its 5000 default to 65k.  No useful information is showing up in the event viewer.  We also both watched our resource monitor, and we havent even gotten to 1 network utilization, the CPU is also close to 0 usage as well.p  pWe just got off the phone with our ISP, and they are saying that they are not limiting us in any way but the guy was kinda unsure and ended up hanging up on us anyway after a 30 minute hold time...p  pWe are trying everything to figure this issue out, but cannot come up with the solution.  I would be very greatful if someone out there could give us a hand with this issue.p  pP.S. Both computers are on Verizon FIOS with the same verizon router.  Another thing to note, the server is using WSAAccept and NOT AcceptEx.  The client simulator is attempting to connect over many seconds though, so I am pretty sure the connects are not getting backlogged.  We have tried to change the speed at which the client simulator connects, and no matter what speed it is set to it fails right around the same number each time.p  pUPDATE We simulated 2 separate clients on 2 separate machines on network A.  The server was running on network B.  Each client was only able to connect half about 1600 connections to the server.  We were initially using a port below 1,000, this has been changed to above 50,000.  The router log on both machines showed nothing.  We are both using the Actiontec MI424WR verizon FIOS router.  This leads me to believe the problem is not with the client code.  The server throws no errors and has no unexpected behavior.  Could this be an ISPRouter issuep  pUPDATE The solution has been found.  The verizon router we were using MI424WR revision C is unable to handle any more than 3700 connections, we tested this with a separate set of networks.  Thanks for the help guysp  pThanks  Rick  p

Then I calculate the distance and draw the line in simple mouse down, move and up events.p  pAfter drawing many lines on canvas, I click on any one of the line. I want to select the line and show the user that line is selected like by changing the color of the line. So user can delete it.p  pThanks.p

Thanks, a million, in advance, for any help pointing me in the right direction.p  pIf anyone can help get this to work, you will quite possibly make this the happiest day of my yearp  pGoal To dynamically append wordpress members userid to outbound affiliate links for the purpose of tracking each members purchase totals and subsequently giving them the appropriate credit for same. I know this is possible working examples include fatwallet.com and ebates.com which recently purchased fatwallet.com, both are cash back sites that offer to share affiliate commission with their site members.p  pBackgroundExample Fatwallet even goes so far as to report, within your member screen, the fact that you merely clicked on an affiliate link within minutes of doing so. That kind of functionality would be nice and reassuring to members but is not necessary for the concept were looking to implement by we, I mean a small group of sales and service pros with better ideas than ebates, but only an advanced novice understanding or knowledge of programming code required. Besides, doing that kind of backend reporting would be easier since it requires simple http get calls to the affiliate networks in question in order to obtain data for each individual user id, BUT, we first need to figure out how to dynamically append that user id to the affiliate link in real time so the affiliate network can attach the rest of the clicks data to it once thats done, rerouting the data from affiliate network back to the user weve already got figured out.p  pPotential problemConsiderable variable To aggregate affiliate links and present them, we use a third party service called popshops. Popshops can be used two ways 1 Point and click building of mini stores provides pop it in code available in java, html, php, xml, csv, rss, atom, vbscript, C, and vb.net OR 2 Dynamic loading of predefined or user defined search engine variables via popshops API and http get requests. Both require use of popshops class obv troubleshooting section of popshops states that additional tracking sub IDs may be appended to either of these methods I would like to figure out both.

Negative 92859 pI am trying to understand the possible ways to work with SQLite when there can be multiple threads work on DB. Based on various responses in stackoverflow and other sites, it appears that there will be locking issue when same sqlitehelper instance is used from multiple threads. In a typical java application, I would expect instance to mean single object of type sqlite helper to be used by different threads of application.In such cases, the locks ,I guess, are a matter of correctly using the synchronized blocks. [Correct me here as I am not comfortable with this way of looking at sqliethelper instance here]p  pMy concern is with sharing same data base  when one instantiate sqlite helper in different threads [ie each thread has its own object instance] but working on same Database [this I guess is more inline with having same db instance].  In such cases Im getting frequent database lock errors. This occurs even when the threads are working on different tables of database.p  pIn my application database can be updated by user interaction through application or by getting data through server [periodic synchronization]. And some time when synchronization process and user activity overlaps, I get the lock issues. As this pattern of data processing seems to be common in application synchronizing with server, would like to know how do lock issue due the concurrency is to be handled.p  pI would like to understand this since if this is bound to happen always then probably need to make only one handler over database and implement queue over that to avoid lock. But that will mean the complete application needs to be aware that the database may not get updated immediately and they need to implement listener to know when the data is actually updated in database.p  pthanks pradeepp

Negative 92859 pBACKGROUNDp  pWere developing a custom application which access SharePoint through the Client Object Model and this application need to access ECT external content type lists defined in SharePoint using the OM Object Model. This application is a product that should be usable with most SharePoint installations and configuration and cannot have prior knowledge of External Lists.p  pWhen there are no filters set up for the ECT, SharePoint returns all the available items in the list given the number is below the threshold. The moment we define a filter for this ECT, SharePoint return only the items after this filter is applied probably correct behaviour from SP.p  pPROBLEMp  pWe need to be able to search this ECT list nonfiltered based on text entered by a user in a search box. At the moment there seem to be no way to change the filter SharePoint applied when returning the values to the calling object.p  pI.e. I have 10 items in my ECT list 1,2,310. Each Item has 3 columns ID, Name, Description. After setting up a filter for the ECT list, SharePoint return items 2, 3 amp 6 when I ask SharePoint for a list of items.p  pNo the user does a search the matches the description of item 7. How can I searchfilter the list to return the item that match my search queryp  pIve been running in circles trying to solve this, but nothing seem to work.

Negative 92859 pIve got a Application with 4 activities, A, X, Y, and Z.p  pA is a kind of landing Activity, which displays a bunch of information from a database for the user.  p  pX, Y, and Z are Activities started by A to modify the data.  These activities do not actually query the database, but rather return the changed information to A, which does all the work in codeonActivityResultcode.  The flow is always A  X or Y or Z  A.  This works perfectly.p  pWhat Id like to do is make it so that the user can navigate between X, Y, and Z any number of times until a save button is clicked.  This would modify the flow such that A  X  Y  Z  A is possible.  However, the data only needs to be persisted from the Activity that clicks save, in that example Z.  A would then receive the result from Z, handle this change, and continue.  If the user navigates in this way, it doesnt matter what happened in X and Y, they have been discarded.p  pIve made a few attempts at this.  My best was by calling codefinishcode immediately after X, Y, or Z starts another activity thats not A.  This allows the user to return to A when clicking save, meaning the navigation aspect of it is correct, but the result code that gets sent is always codeRESULTCANCELEDcode.  Ive looked into using the Intent flag codeFLAGFORWARDRESULTcode, but I dont have experience with it and it throws an error when used with an activity that was already started for result.  Im not sure thats even the right technique to be exploring, because from what Ive read its only used if there will be one activity in between the calling activity and the one that returns the result.p  pIs such a flow even possible Basically, I need an Activity to launch another for result, allow the user to perform some arbitrary amount of navigation from that second activity, then return a result to the original activity when theyre done navigating.  Its possible to just modify the code such that X, Y, and Z do the database access themselves, but I would rather avoid it if I could.p

I do not control the server and so cannot access its private key.  I do however control the client the program is running on.  My question is, how in practice would I configure wireshark to decrypt the SSL traffic for the scenario I have just described  Is there a specific key HttpsURLConnection uses that I can add to Wireshark  Is there something elsep  pI should note that I have considered simply adding logging into the Java code base, but would ultimately prefer the ground truth of a packet capture over logging, as I might missomit something important in the logging of a code base I dont fully understand.  p
Negative 92859 pI have started monitoring my ISPs downtimes with a looping PHP script which checks the connection automatically every 5 seconds and stores the result in MySQL database. The scripts checks if its able to reach a couple of remote websites and logs the result. The time and status of the check are always stored in the database.p  pThe structure of the table is followingp  precodeid auto increment time time stamp status varchar codepre  pNow to my issue. p  pI have the data, but I dont know how to use it to achieve the result I would like to get. Basically I would like to find all the periods of time when the connection was down and for how long the connection was down. p  pFor instance if we have 10 rows with following datap  precode0  20120724 222300  up 1  20120724 222305  up 2  20120724 222310  down 3  20120724 222316  down 4  20120724 222321  up 5  20120724 222326  down 6  20120724 222332  down 7  20120724 222337  up 8  20120724 222342  up 9  20120724 222347  up codepre  pthe query should return the periods from 222310 to 222321, and from 222326 to 222337. So the query should find always the time between the first time the connection goes down, and the first time the connection is up again.p  pOne method I thought could work was finding all the rows where the connection goes down or up, but how could I find these rows And is there some better solution than thisp  pI really dont know what the query should look like, so the help would be highly appreciated.p  pemThank you, regards Lassiemp

Negative 92859 pThere might be a group of records in a table where only two fields vary record by record, and rest fields remains same.

However for whatever reason, I have been unable to successfully install Grunt BBB so I cannot download the working examples.p  pWhat I am trying to do is follow this router section and use views. a hrefhttpaddyosmani.github.combackbonefundamentalsrouter.js relnofollowhttpaddyosmani.github.combackbonefundamentalsrouter.jsa. p  pThe problem is that I think these instructions are incomplete. For a start the collection.fetch variable is in the wrong scope, and I really am not understanding where I need to place the views and how. I am pretty sure that if I could see a working example of this I could understand it, but as I said, everywhere I look its a different implementation.p  pDoes anyone know how to use the backboneboilerplate with routers and views Are there any working examples anywherep

Negative 92859 pI am new to VSLightswitch 2012 and also new to silverlight. In a lightswitch database I want to store tables of measured values. Each table of MeasuredValues has a certain Unity. So I have a table of Unities like m, mm, C and each Unity has a table of possible UnityConversions like mm to m, mm to cm. e.g. the Unity m has no conversion m to C because this makes no sense at all. Each UnityConversion has a Unity it ConvertsTo. A Unityconversion e.g. is 0.00112m  1.12mmp  pSo when the user creates or edits the table of measured values he should be able to select the unity out of all existing Unities.  But when the Unity has to be converted it should only be possible to convert the value into the suitable Unity out of the table of UnityConversion of the current Unity. So far so good all tables are defined. But how to do the UnityConversion thing I guess the easiest way would be to create a button below the Unity of the MeasuredValue that brings up a Modal Window Picker where the user can select the UnityConversion.p  pBut how to fill a Modal Window Picker with the UnityConversions of the current Unity I have tried the Modal Window Picker it shows all existing Unities, but instead it should show the possible UnityConversions.p  pthats where I stick, any idea is welcome thank you in advancep  pOops  Edit 14.Dec.2012 p  precodeMValue Id Integer Value Double Unity Unity relationship Unity Id Integer Name String ShortName String Conversions collection of UnityConversion relationship Converts     collection of UnityConversion relationship MValues      collection of MValue relationship UnityConversion Id Integer Name String Factor Double ConvertTo Unity relationship Unities   Unity relationship the relationship between Unity and UnityConversion is doubly so it looks like Unity                        UnityConversion Conversionsvisible gt Unities    invisi.

Negative 92859 pSo Ive been struggling for a while with my Android application. Im fairly new to Android programming and made the application for a customer. Back then I programmed it for new devices like the S2 and S3 from Samsung. Now I got a problem Garbage Collection. Ive read some posts about the mechanics and how to get less GC, but I dont think it will help. I hope someone can hint me on how to take care of GC.p  pMy code does the following it downloads a lot of data from a online CRM called vTiger. Its a dynamic system so the application gets a lot of linked data, not just for example a Users table with username and password. Now this goes into JSON objects and I split those out so I can use all the data, in a loop like this for each module, get all records. Well those records combined are about 5000 now, still growing with usage.p  pA lot of info, so I store all the information into ArrayList and ArrayList, which are simple objects I made to hold information. I remember I didnt just write the objects to the database instead of hold them in the ArrayList as the database got overloaded. So what I did is save all those objects around 5000  10000 in the ArrayLists and then use Transactions on the SQLite database. This way it worked well.p  pBUT, On the emulator  older devices I get a LOT of GCconcurrent logging, which means I got memory leaks in my code. I understand that the device cannot hold all those objects in its memory but how would you take care of this Due to GC, older devices cannot process through my sync function. For example I let the emulator run for a few hours but it was almost stuck very,very, very slow halfway through the sync.p  pHope someone is willing to give me some advice, if even possible.

Negative 92859 pSo I am currently trying to render complex models at a decent speed, and having some trouble rendering a single model causes my framerate to become strained, without any added work in the program.  My model of which there is only one in the scene appears to be too large.  There are 444384 floats in the vertex array I upload to the buffer so 24688 triangles in the model.p  precodeCreate vertex buffers glGenBuffers1, ampmBuffer glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, mBuffer     int SizeInBytes  mArraySize  6  sizeoffloat glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, SizeInBytes, NULL, GLDYNAMICDRAW  Upload buffer data glBufferSubDataGLARRAYBUFFER, 0, sizeoffloat  VertArray.size, ampVertArray[0] codepre  pI know the size of the VBO is what makes the difference because A reducing the size improves performance, and B commenting out the rendering codep  precodeglPushMatrix  Translate glTranslatefmPosition.x, mPosition.y, mPosition.z  glMultMatrixfmRotationMatrix  Bind buffers for vertex and index arrays glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, mBuffer  glEnableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glVertexPointer3, GLFLOAT, 6  sizeoffloat, 0 glEnableClientStateGLNORMALARRAY glNormalPointerGLFLOAT, 6  sizeoffloat, void12  Draw glDrawArraysGLTRIANGLES, 0, mArraySize  glDisableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glDisableClientStateGLNORMALARRAY  Unbind the buffers glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, 0  glPopMatrix codepre  pleaves me with around 20002500 FPS, whereas uncommenting this code sinks me down to around 130FPS, or 8msframe which alone is more than enough, but I need to be able to do other things in the program as well, some of which might be CPUintensive.  A more complex model with 85k triangles brings that down to under 50 FPS, or around 20msframe, at which point the program visibly stutters.p  pThe one pair of shaders I use is very minimal at this point, I doubt thats the issue.  Here they are, just in case first the vertex shaderp  precodevoid main      vec3 normal, lightDir     vec4 diffuse     float NdotL      first transform the normal into eye space and normalize the result       normal  normalizeglNormalMatrix  glNormal      now normalize the lights direction. Note that according to the      OpenGL specification, the light is stored in eye space. Also since     were talking about a directional light, the position field is actually     direction      lightDir  normalizevec3glLightSource[0].position      compute the cos of the angle between the normal and lights direction.      The light is directional so the direction is constant for every vertex.     Since these two are normalized the cosine is the dot product. We also     need to clamp the result to the [0,1] range.      NdotL  maxdotnormal, lightDir, 0.0      Compute the diffuse term       diffuse  glFrontMaterial.diffuse  glLightSource[0].diffuse     glFrontColor   NdotL  diffuse      glPosition  ftransform   codepre  pAnd the fragment shaderp  precodevoid main      glFragColor  glColor  codepre  pI am running the program using a a hrefhttpwww.geforce.comhardwarenotebookgpusgeforcegtx660m relnofollowGTX 660Ma as my graphics card.p  pNow as far as I know, VBOs are the fastest way to render large amounts of polygons in OpenGL, and the Internet seems to suggest that many machines can calculate and display millions of polygons at once, so Im sure there must be a way to optimize the rendering of my comparatively measly 27k triangles.  Id rather do that now than have to rewrite and restructure larger amounts of code in the future.p  pI have enabled backface culling I am not sure fustrum culling would help because at times, all or most of the model is onscreen I currently cull objects, but not triangles within individual objects.  Culling the faces in the viewport that are not facing the camera might help a bit, but Im not sure how to do that.  Beyond that, Im not sure what to do to optimize the rendering.  I havent implemented a vertex buffer yet, but Ive read that that might only increase the speed around 10.p  pHow do people achieve tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles onscreen at once at acceptable framerates with other stuff going on  What can I do to improve the performance of my VBO renderingp  pstrongUPDATEstrong As per comments below, I drew only half of the array as followsp  pglDrawArraysGLTRIANGLES, 0, mArraySize2p  pAnd then a quarter of the arrayp  pglDrawArraysGLTRIANGLES, 0, mArraySize4p  pReducing the amount of array drawn each time literally doubled the speed from 12 ms to 6 and 3 ms, respectively, yet the model was entirely intact  nothing was missing.  This seems to suggest that I am doing something wrong somewhere else, but I dont know what Im fairly confident Im not adding the same triangles 4 times when I compose the model, so what else could it be  Might I perhaps somehow be uploading the buffer multiple timesp

This option is discouraged, as it results in Cursor queries being performed on the applications UI thread and thus can cause poor responsiveness or even Application Not Responding errors. As an alternative, use LoaderManager with a CursorLoader. p blockquote  pDoes this mean that SimpleCursorAdapter should not be used even on lower API versions eg.

Negative 92859 pI recently have been working on code that periodically imports some data from an old database my company is in the process of phasing out.  I set up a connection pool on glassfish for the old database, which I then inject as a datasource via the Resource annotation.  It works well, except when the database is unavailable.  In that situation, the server dumps an entire stack trace to the logs related to a javax.resource.spi.ResourceAllocationException.  That makes sense, given that the resource look up is throwing a SQLException related to not being able to access the database.

On FPGAs there is Blockram, fixed chunks of ram one can use, if one needs more ram than is available in one block multiple blocks are combined. Varying with the technology the size of the available blockrams can change. Thus I write an entity with two generic parameters codememorycode and codetechnologycode that implements my memory with the least Blockrams possible. This might lead to the Memory being larger than requested. If I now have another entity that needs the size of the memory to fully utilitize it i.e. circular buffer controller, I have to supply it the actual size of the memory allocated.p

Ive solved that temporarily by replacing the row codetime  time  timecode with codetime  time  80  timecode where I increase the current number em80em with 5 or 10 to make it accurate.p  pstrongShort explanationstrong I have to add seconds to the current time when calculating the difference to make so that it doesnt echo just strong[SPACE]agostrong.p  pIm using this function when Ive updated my status on my page, an insertquery gets sent to the database without the timecolumn filled and because the timestamp column is the current timestamp on default it gets set to the current timestamp. p  pHow can I fix this because I really understand that adding 5 or 10 everyday wont be stable in the future.p  pPS. I dont think I can restart my MySQL server or such because Im on a webhost and I guess I dont have the right privileges to do so.p  pstrongEDIT1strong It looks like the inserted timestamp is around 1 minute ahead then it is in real life. Could this be causing itp  pstrongEDIT2strong Now, a couple of weeks later I need to add between 100 amp 200 seconds extra to make sure the emtime agoem function is accurate.p

Negative 92859 pIm working on a 2D game in which the terrain can vary and is composed of any shape of polygons except for self intersecting ones. The player collision box is in the shape of a square and can move about. My question is this How do I keep an alwaysupright box to collide with variable terrain and always stay outsidep  pMy current approach that I made up albeit no code yet works like the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com66Zc1.png altprototypep  pThe blue square is the player hitbox. First, it moves with a velocity downwards as an example. My goal is to find the heighest point in its travel path where it can be safely outside of the terrain polygon. I test all the terrain vertex points inside its travel path and project them to the velocity of the box. I take the farthest projection.p  pThe farthest projection will be the max distance allowed to move in without going into the terrain.p  pMove the square by distance in the direction of velocity and done.p  pHowever, there are few scenarios that I encountered where this does not work. Take this as an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTmLqK.png altFailure of algorithmp  pTo remedy this situation, I now test for one corner of the square. If the distance from the corner is shorter than the farthest projection, then that distance will give the appropriate shift in distance. This pretty much makes the algorithm fullproof. Unless someone states another exception.p  pIm going a little crazy and I would appreciate feedback on my algorithm. If anyone has any suggestions or good reads about 2D upright box collisions on terrain or anything similar, that would be great.p

Negative 92859 pMS Access randomly deletes a SQL querys content when a nonvba macro exports the query contents to excel.

Id much prefer to just prevent this from happening rather than fixing it postmortem. a hrefhttpbytes.comtopicaccessanswers620958destinationfield relnofollowThis forum post on bytes.coma also discusses the issue. The suggested solution is not relevant.p  pThe problem database was originally designed in Access 2007 and is now being used in Access 2010. All the queries and macros that are involved in this issue were created using Access 2007. These components were stable in Access 2007.

Negative 92859 pI am working on a live wallpaper my first actually , and I seem to have a reached an impassep  pIf you havent guessed it by the variable names and the code, the live wallpaper in question is a clock. Its components must follow a very strict degreestime ratio in total there will be over a dozen bitmaps rotating at different rates, in different directions some following the same ratiosrules.p  pAnyways... As it stands, every additional bitmap that is added pretty much doubles the length of execution of drawFrame. If I was going to stop at 3 moving parts, it wouldnt be so bad, it looks OK as is but increase the amount of bitmaps by 9 or even 2 or 3 more and the frame rate becomes unacceptable.p  pI am not redecoding bitmaps every turn as is recommended...p  pWhat should I do to remedy this situationp  pI was thinking of looking into openGL surfaceengine, but i saw an exchange on SO where a user was handling over 100 bitmaps at once without problem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4981707androiddrawbitmapperformanceforlotsofbitmapsAndroid drawBitmap Performance For Lots of Bitmapsa, which got me hoping I could do the same.p  pI also included an appropriate version of each image in the respective drawable dpi folders.

The part is already adaptive and I also set it to be adaptive in the assembly. This is where my problem lies. Sometimes the part file wont be able to become adaptive.

Negative 92859 pI have an application that uses native plugins. I have my own binary format for these plugins. Each plugin is loaded at runtime using a method similar to mapping a DLL into the process space. This means, each plugin have its own codeImageBasecode, sections like code.textcode or code.datacode are handled in the same way as conventional DLLs. The only thing that is different is the binary format of the plugin its not a codePEcode file and the loader code that maps the plugin into the process space.p  pNow I know that ETW when doing the trace by this commandlinep  precodexperf on latency stackwalk profile buffersize 1024 minbuffers 300 start tracea1 on MicrosoftWindowsWin32kstack  codepre  pwill emit events that can be used to reconstruct the process environment during the trace capture. That is, it will emit events like add process, add thread to a process, add DLL module to a process, so that tools like codexperfviewcode can build a virtual environment of the state of processes in the system and build information like current process tree.

Sometimes the dev responsible to make the production build fails to update these values and it would be nice to have a way to make automated builds for production currently we only have automated builds for CI and these values depend on what the devs last pushed to the central code repository, so we cant get 100 code coverage with unit tests.p  pThis is one example of dev vs. prod values in our servletcontextp  precodeltbeansbean idprojectApp classcom.project.appgt     ltbeansproperty nameconfig refconfiggt ltbeansbeangt  ltbeansbean idconfig classcom.project.Configgt     lt Dev gt     ltbeansproperty namefirstServiceUrl valuehttplocalhost8010gt     ltbeansproperty namesecondServiceUrl valuehttplocalhost8020gt     ltbeansproperty namedatabase valuelocalhostgt     lt QA gt     lt ltbeansproperty namefirstServiceUrl valuehttpsqa.services.urlfirstgt gt     lt ltbeansproperty namesecondServiceUrl valuehttpsqa.services.urlsecondgt gt     lt ltbeansproperty namedatabase value192.168.5.5gt gt     lt Production gt     lt ltbeansproperty namefirstServiceUrl valuehttpsprod.services.urlfirstgt gt     lt ltbeansproperty namesecondServiceUrl valuehttpsprod.services.urlsecondgt gt     lt ltbeansproperty namedatabase value192.168.5.5gt gt ltbeansbeangt codepre  pIs there a way to easily and quickly switch between values Can we have a flag which tells Spring or Maven that were doing a production build to make it use the production values Is there a way to export the build type in the target code.warcode file name using Maven, to get something like codeproject1.0.0dev.warcode and codeproject1.0.0production.warcodep

Negative 92859 pIn my application, I save large, serialized codeArrayListltHashMapltString, Stringgtgtcodesp  pThere are between six and twelve strings in each hashmap. In testing, I save arrays of length two hundred at most.p  pAn issue has arisen whereby this data goes missing in the live environment. There are no crashes reported, and Im unable to repeat the problem myself with test data. When users attempt to view a list comprised of some of this data, it appears empty. The list is definitely saved on the phone and successfully loaded at least once, but after this does not load successfully. As far as I am aware, this only happens when a user has a large amount of data stored in this way.p  pAre there any limits to data size, or other knows issues, that could possibly be causing this As I said, I find it impossible to replicate so it seems to be an issue with large arraylists or with different phone types.p  pThanks for the help p

Therefore, I am running Linux in a VM to test this out.p  pstrongVirtual Machine in VirtualBoxstrongp  ul liOS Linux Mint 16li liDesktop Environment XFCEli ul  pEverything below was done in this environment. Ive tried both with X running and in one of the other ttys.p  h2My Thoughtsh2  pIll alter this if someone can correct me.p  pIve done a fair bit of reading to realize that higherlevel libraries do not provide this kind of functionality. Modifier keys are used with other keys to provide an alternate key code. Accessing the modifier keys themselves through a highlevel library in Linux isnt as easy. Or, rather, I havent found a highlevel API for this on Linux. p  pI thought a hrefhttpwww.leonerd.org.ukcodelibtermkeylibtermkeya would be the answer, but it doesnt seem to support the Shift modifier key any better than normal keystroke retrieval. Im also not sure if it works without X.p  pWhile working with libtermkey before I realized it didnt get shift in cases like ShiftReturn, I was planning to write a daemon that would run to gather keyboard events. Running copies of the daemon program would simply pipe requests for keyboard data and receive keyboard data in response. I could use this setup to have something always running in the background, in case I cannot check key code statuses at specific times have to be receive key codes as they happen.p  pBelow are my two attempts to write a program that can read from the Linux keyboard device. Ive also included my small check to make sure I had the right device.p  h2Attempt 1h2  pI have tried to access the keyboard device directly, but am encountering issues. I have tried the suggestion a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4225290 titleStack Overflow suggestionherea that is in another Stack Overflow thread. It gave me a segmentation fault so, I changed it from fopen to openp  precode ...  int fd fd  opendevinputbypathplatformi8042serio0eventkbd, ORDONLY  char keymap[KEYMAX8  1]  memsetkeymap, 0, sizeofkeymap ioctlfd, EVIOCGKEYsizeof keymap, keymap   ... codepre  pWhile there was no segmentation fault, there was no indicator of any key press not just modifier keys. I tested this usingp  precode.foo ampamp echo TRUE  echo FALSE codepre  pIve used that to test for successful return codes from commands quite a lot so, I know thats fine. Ive also outputted the key always 0 and mask 0100 to check. It just doesnt seem to detect anything.p  h2Attempt 2h2  pFrom here, I thought Id try a slightly different approach. I wanted to figure out what I was doing wrong. Following a hrefhttpbaruch.siach.nameblogpostslinuxinputkeysstatusthisa page providing a snippet demonstrating printing out key codes, I bundled that into a programp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdint.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt include ltlinuxinput.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv      uint8t keys[128]     int fd      fd  opendevinputbypathplatformi8042serioeventkbd, ORDONLY     for           memsetkeys, 0, 128         ioctl fd, EVIOCGKEYsizeof keys, keys          int i, j         for i  0 i lt sizeof keys i             for j  0 j lt 8 j                 if keys[i] amp 1 ltlt j                     printf key code dn, i8  j           return 0  codepre  pPreviously, I had the size to 16 bytes instead of 128 bytes. I should honestly spend a bit more time understanding ioctl and EVIOCGKEY. I just know that it supposedly maps bits to specific keys to indicate presses, or something like that strongcorrect me if Im wrong, pleasestrong.p  pI also didnt have a loop initially and would just hold down various keys to see if a key code appeared. I received nothing so, I thought a loop might make the check easier to test in case a missed something.p  h2How I know the input device is the right oneh2  pI tested it by running codecatcode on the input device. Specificallyp  precode sudo cat devinputbypathplatformi8042serio0eventkbd codepre  pGarbage ASCII was sent to my terminal on key press and release events starting with the return enter key when I began the output using cat. I also know that this seems to work fine with modifier keys like shift, control, function, and even Apples command key on my Macbook running a Linux VM. Output appeared when a key was pressed, began to appear rapidly from subsequent signals sent by holding the key down, and outputted more data when a key was released.p  pSo, while my approach may not be the right one Im willing to hear stronganystrong alternative, the device seems to provide what I need.p  pFurthermore, I know that this device is just a link pointing to devinputevent2 from runningp  precode ls l devinputbypathplatformi8042serio0eventkbd codepre  pIve tried both programs above with devinputevent2 and received no data. Running cat on devinputevent2 provided the same output as with the link.p
Negative 92859 pI need to persist objects and I want to keep my data classes as clean as possible. The persisted classes do not feature any businesslogic code, but only data with getterssetters.p  pIm currently implementing a solution with the Observer pattern. Each time an Observable persisted object is modified, it fires a message to an Observer object that takes care of persistence. This way, the only constraint for the persisted object is to be Observable. It keeps things clean.p  pAnother solution maybe better would be to implement some DAO pattern, and Im not very aware of the way it works. Maybe it would look like codepersistedObject.savecode or codepersistedObject.readByIdidcode. But it means I would have to define some DAO interface and then to implement the readcreateupdatedelete method in each and every persisted classp

I would ordinarily find this an extremely unlikely explanation, but after spending 2.5 days trying to debug the code only to discover that it executes properly with breakpoints turned off, Im having trouble understanding what could have been the problem.p  pstrongDetailsstrong  p  pTwo different errors occur when breakpoints are on.  p  precodeRuntime error 457 This key is already associated with an element of this collection codepre  pand  p  precodeRuntime error 424 Object required codepre  pThe 457 error would occur after stepping through the code from the breakpoint to the line  p  precode dictE.Add M.SubMatches.Item0, tmpQ codepre  pwhere one of the conditions for reaching this line of code was that codedictE.ExistsM.SubMatches.Item0code was False.p  pThe 424 error would occur after choosing codeDebugcode when the 457 error occurred. In a similarly zany manner, the error would be thrown by the different line  p  precode pathE  dictE.ItemMatches.Itemi.SubMatches.Item0.InFile codepre  pwhere one of the conditions for reaching this line of code was that codedictE.ExistsMatches.Itemi.SubMatches.Item0code was True and the code.InFilecode property of the object is always defined.p  pBoth of these errors occur in the same method of a custom class. Id like to post all of the relevant code, but its workrelated and proprietary. Any ideas why this would happen Is this a known issue I tried googling for reports of similar problems, but I found nothing.p

Negative 92859 pSay if I was to make an app for Android that pulls data from a server which contains a list of surveys, each survey containing a set of questions and each question has a set of options or answersp  pNow Im thinking to implement each survey using a listview, each rowitem in the list view will display one question and each question will display a set of answers.p  pThe first problem is to do with the type of question...a question might be of the binary answer format, so Are you male then two options yes and no this can be an xml layout for that type of question. But then there is other type of questions, like Describe your time in London with an EditText as the option. The harder part comes when I dont know how many options are to be viewed inside a listItem row of the listview, say one question can be Your favourite foods and the list of options can be checkboxes, so Pizza, bacon, wedges. This is a 3 option type of quuestion, but what if I have the same type of question but with, say 7 options. p  pHow can I make an XML layout that will adapt to the number of options to a particular questionp  pthanks in advance.p

Negative 92859 pI want to know if its really possible to play an AAC ADTS header file with Netstream.appendbytes. Im talking about files that end code.aaccode not AAC audio inside M4A or MP4 containers.p  pIm aware Netstream cant parse ADTS headers etc so I already have a class for parsing the data and gives back correct info such as channels, bitrates, framelengths etc. p  pstrongPutting this together gives silencestrong Make FLV header  append strongstrong Make audio tag header  append strongstrong now append with rawheaderless AAC payload frame 1  update previous tag size strongstrong Make new audio tag for next AAC frame amp append strongstrong rawheaderless payload append frame 2 and so on until track end.  p  pCan someone please clarifyp  ul lipIn the FLV tag we put extra byte to specify whether Raw or Sequenced AAC type.

Negative 92859 pI have been trying to get an answer for this for sometime now but not been able to find it. p  pIs there a way that I can specify a new option value for the hop by hop extension header in IPv6, so that I can parse the value in the user space rather than the kernel parsing itp  pThe kernel when tries to parse the value, sends me an ICMP reply stating parameter not recognized for that value in the header. p  pIm wondering if there should be a way to deploy and test new options in IPv6 extension header without writing handlers for them as LKM.p  pThere isnt a lot available on the web for IPv6, so any help from IPv6 experts would be greatp  pRFC 2460 mentions this. I assume you can create a new option type for testing any new applicationsp  blockquote   pMindful of the need for compatibility with existing IPv6 deployments,   new IPv6 extension headers MUST NOT be created or specified, unless   no existing IPv6 Extension Header can be used by specifying a new   option for that existing IPv6 Extension Header.

I had to put one of my own otherwise the form would redirect me toward the original FOS controller. Is that the right way to use FOS chaning the path of the form in the twig rather than have it link in the PHP, seems dirty to me pli ul

Negative 92859 pI am trying to build an application on my local machine using Twitters OAuth 1.1 API and Facebooks SDK v4 both for PHP. p  pBoth of these mechanisms redirect the user to prompt for permission and redirect back to website.

So instead I set up a virtual host using my Mac based MAMP installation and added that url to both Twitter and Facebook applications. Now Facebook does not allow me to use my virtual host. When the prompt for permissions happens and Facebook redirects back to my site, when  I try and retrieve the session using getSessionFromRedirect it returns NULL. This does not happen if I run the same code using localhost.p  pI have tried using 127.0.0.1 but Facebook does not allow this either error is invalid because it is a Facebook url, but Twitter doesp  pHas anyone else had any problems with this or does anyone have any pointers that would help me to test both of these on the same deployment.p  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 92859 pI think what Im doing is correct, but since this could blow up quite badly if not, Id really like clarification.p  pThe code is an example to try and express the point, sorry for any minor typos.p  pI have the following class p  precodepublic class Components      public final String mVar1     public final boolean mVar2      public ComponentsString var1, boolean var2              mVar1  mVar1         mVar2  mVar2       codepre  pIf I create a volatile instance of this class, I believe that assigning the value of this component to the address of one already created and in memory is thread safe.p  precodepublic class Storage      public static volatile Components sComponents  null  codepre  pSo, regardless of whether I set this variable on the main or any other thread where a set will simply point it to an object already created, NOT create a new one, it should be thread safe, because the volatile keyword is acting on the Components reference, which will just be updated to point to the object that already exists.p  pSo, for examplep  precodepublic class ThreadedClass      public ThreadedClass               Create an instance of Components so we have something to copy         mInitialComponents  new ComponentsMy String, false           Spin off a thread         createanewthread threadEntryPoint             This function is called every frame on the main thread     public void update               If we have our components, print them out         if Storage.sComponents  null                      printsComponents.mVar1             printsComponents.mVar2                    private Components mInitialComponents  null      private void threadEntryPoint               Just sleep for a bit so update gets called a few times         sleep3000           Set our components         Storage.sComponents  mInitialComponents       codepre  pIn the real world code, mInitialComponents is created and accessed via a synchronized function so accessing the original object is thread safe.p  pSo, my question is, when calling update on the main or any other thread, once Storage.sComponents has been set to the existing object in threadEntryPoint, is it simply updating the objects reference, so the object will be guaranteed to be complete whenever we check for null.p  pOr is it possible for some or none of the internal members to have been correctly assigned.p  pThanksp

Negative 92859 pI am trying to properley implement a background worker with a progress bar in my app. What my app does is check to see if certain files exist on the PC. If they dont, it will copy the files from a server over to the PC. It also checks, if the files do already exist, to see if there are any newer versions of the file for download. If so, it copies them over.p  pI would like to implement a background worker with progress bar to show the user how far done it is. My work consists of 4 methods that fire to check for and copy the files. And that is where I get confused. All examples I have seen with progress bars and background workers dont usually have methods in the DoWork of the worker.p  pHere is my codep  precodeprivate void btnClickClickobject sender, EventArgs e              Form1 frm  new Form1         frm.Enabled  false to insure the user doesnt close the form until the progress is completed         worker  new BackgroundWorker         worker.WorkerSupportsCancellation  false         worker.DoWork  DoWork         worker.ProgressChanged  ProgressChanged         worker.WorkerReportsProgress  true         worker.RunWorkerAsync         worker.RunWorkerCompleted  workerRunWorkerCompleted         while worker.IsBusy I think this is my mistake. Is this in the right place                      progressBar.Increment1             Application.DoEvents                     private void workerRunWorkerCompletedobject sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e              Form1 frm  new Form1         if e.Error  null                      lblDisp.Text  e.Error.Message             frm.Enabled  true                  else                      lblDisp.Text  Done             frm.Enabled  true              The form will then enable again and display a message once the worker is done      private void ProgressChangedobject sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e              progressBar.Value  e.ProgressPercentage           protected void DoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e              And these are the methods that work.         FindFolders         FindFiles         ReplaceExeFile         CopyDllFiles      codepre  pThe methods in my app are just your typical copy and overwritep  precodestring folderProg  Cnewprog.exe         string debugProg  192.169.1.1progfilesprog.exe          var versionDebug  FileVersionInfo.GetVersionInfodebugProg         var versionFolder  FileVersionInfo.GetVersionInfofolderProg         Version verFold  new VersionversionFolder.FileVersion         Version verDeb  new VersionversionDebug.FileVersion          if verDeb gt verFold                      File.CopydebugProg, folderProg, true          codepre  pSo I know there is nothing wrong with the work. It does copy. My problem is the bar fills up before the actual work starts. And if I move the increment code, it doesnt fill up 100. The files are copied but the bar would be only 10 full.p  pSo basically, I know I have put the increment code in the wrong place, but I dont know where the code should go.p  pAn ugly way to do this would be to put codeworker.ReportProgress25code and increment by 25 in the DoWork and just fill it when completed, while commenting out codeprogressBar.Increment1code in the codewhile worker.IsBusycode code. But this is because I know there are 4 methods 425. Like sop  precodeprivate void btnClickClickobject sender, EventArgs e              Form1 frm  new Form1         frm.Enabled  false         worker  new BackgroundWorker         worker.WorkerSupportsCancellation  false         worker.DoWork  DoWork         worker.ProgressChanged  ProgressChanged         worker.WorkerReportsProgress  true         worker.RunWorkerAsync         worker.RunWorkerCompleted  workerRunWorkerCompleted         while worker.IsBusy                      progressBar.Increment1             Application.DoEvents                     private void workerRunWorkerCompletedobject sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e              Form1 frm  new Form1         if e.Error  null                      lblDisp.Text  e.Error.Message             frm.Enabled  true                  else                      lblDisp.Text  Done             frm.Enabled  true                    private void ProgressChangedobject sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e              progressBar.Value  e.ProgressPercentage           protected void DoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e              FindFolders         worker.ReportProgress25         FindFiles         worker.ReportProgress50         ReplaceExeFile         worker.ReportProgress75         CopyDllFiles         worker.ReportProgress100      codepre  pThis way does work.

Negative 92859 pI am kind of new to C, and reading the book The C Programming Language 4th edition. When reading chapter of STL Containers, the book has a introduction to forwardlistp  blockquote   pA forwardlist a singlylinked list is basically a list optimized   for empty and very short lists. An empty forwardlist takes up only   one word. There are surprisingly many uses for lists where most are   empty and the rest are very short.p blockquote  pI am wondering how short a list is considering short And could anyone give a simple example to take the advantage of forwardlistp
Negative 92859 pI am developing Angular app with the html5mode set to true. Everything works great, and  it even has responsive template. During testing however I experienced terrible bug with the browsers not supporting the History API. Imagine I have url likep  precodehttpwww.example.comen codepre  porp  precodehttpww.example.comentouristroutes codepre  pusing history api everything works as expected. But when fallback mode is present it is causing endless refresh loop like this.p  precodehttpwww.example.comenen  the expected behavior httpwww.example.comenen2Fen httpwww.example.comenen2Fen232Fen  and so on  codepre  pLike it is trying to rewrite modern url to the hashbang one.p  pOf course I am not only one experienced this problem. However most of the solutions consisted by specifying p  precodeltbase href gt codepre  ptag in the head. Unfortunately this is not working for me. BUT if I provide in the base tag href with the requested uri I can get some of the links to the work. It is not working completly plus it is ugly hack. Also note that en is not directory in which angular app resides p  pThank for any help in advance....p
Negative 92859 pI am currently testing out pthreads for usage in order to speed up other code I have. Essentially what my code currently has is a couple of for loops that end up doing matrix calculations. I tried spawning threads that will do those calculations simultaneously, and it ended up cutting the runtime in half.p  pMy question is that, is there a way to initially spawn these pthreads, have them run the function, and use them again later to run the same function without them closing Or is it necessary to close them after performing the taskp  pI am using Windows by the way, using a pthreads library.p

Negative 92859 pI have a codeListcode of codeStatcode objects and each codeStatcode has a codeDatecode field. This list may be very large. What I would like to do is organize these objects into date ranges weeks to be specific efficiently. So, if two objects occur in the same week, they go into the same codeListcode. For simplicity, the week intervals are already defined so you dont have to worry about coming up with the ranges.p  pSo here is my current approach. I have a codeLinkedHashMapltDate, ListltStatgtgtcode that contains all the dates I need in ascending order and each entry is initialized with an empty codeArrayListcode. I am thinking for each codeStatcode, iterating through the entire entrySet of the Map, and keeping track of the closest Date that the stat is also greater than or equal to. Then it would be something like codemap.getclosestDate.addstatcode. p  pIt seems like there should be a better way to do this. Perhaps create something like a codefindClosestKeyGreaterThanOrEqualTocode so that I dont have to iterate through the entire map every timep  pAny ideasp

Negative 92859 pFirst off, Im very much a newbie when it comes to Django.p  pThe problem Im struggling with is in trying to create templates for the builtin authentication forms in Django 1.7 but there is very little that I can find in the way of concrete examples anywhere in the documentation or elsewhere.p  pI can find plenty of questions and examples that describe how to manually create the templates or copy them from the Django packages but from what I understand about the Form class and the builtin authentication forms is that I dont need to manually create the actual form in the template. In fact, it seems more desirable to use the Form classes because that would add ensure that fields are named correctly, that the validation such as max length on text fields is applied, etc. p  pCan anyone point me to some concrete examples or documentation of what Im talking about Ive read the following sections already,p  ul lia hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.7topicsforms relnofollowhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.7topicsformsali lia hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.7topicsauthdefault relnofollowhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.7topicsauthdefaultali lia hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.7topicsauthcustomizing relnofollowhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.7topicsauthcustomizingali ul  pIn fact, I would say that this question extends to any Form class in general but Im specifically looking at the authentication forms here because I obviously havent written these Form classes.p  pI dont think it should make any difference from what Ive read since the same process should apply, but I will say that Im using the djangoauthtools package a hrefhttpdjangoauthtools.readthedocs.orgenlatest relnofollowhttpdjangoauthtools.readthedocs.orgenlatestap  pI have the actual authentication system working fine. It logs users in and out, I can enforce that certain urls require the user to be logged in first, etc. so its only the actual form display that is an issue.p

Say for example, the codeActivitycode is an image editor and the codeDialogFragmentcode selects a contrast  the dialog would have a codeOnContrastChangedListenercode that the codeActivitycode implementsli lipThe codeActivitycode has implemented this codeinterfacecode to update views in its UI. Continuing the image editor example, the codeActivitycode implements the codeOnContrastChangedListenercode to update its preview view  something like thisp  precodecontrastDialog.setOnContrastChangedListenernew OnContrastChangedListener      Override     public void OnContrastChangedint newContrast          getPreviewView.updateWithContrastnewContrast                   codepreli lipThe orientation is changed, and everything is recreated and the listener saved and restored correctly using the methods recommended a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsresourcesruntimechanges.html relnofollowherea listener is saved in a codeFragmentcode and restored when the lifecycle is restoring state.pli ol  pThe problem is the listener interface now strongdoes notstrong work. The function codegetPreviewViewcode is now returning codenullcode even though when called anywhere else in the codeActivitycode it returns the correct valuep  pExcuse the poor terminology my knowledge in compiling and bytecode is limited, but I can grasp what has happened. The interface has been compiled with the codegetPreviewViewcode version that returned the preview view that was destroyed on the orientation change, and this has since been released  garbage collected  is now codenullcode. p  pMy question is, is there a way in Java to make the interface compile expecting the values  functions to change  much like the codevolatilecode keyword in C I am expecting there isnt In that case, whats the best approach for getting around this type of situation I have considered the followingp  ul listrikeCreate the codeDialogFragmentcode and its codeinterfacecode in the code that is rerun when the codeActivitycode is recreated. This is fine for things like codeOnClickListenerscode for codeButtonscode as they are definitely created. But this codeDialogFragmentcode is only created when a button is pressed, so this approach means every dialog for the screen is created each time the codeActivitycode is  this seems wasteful given they may not even be run strikeli listrikeCreate all possible codeinterfacescode for the codeActivitycode every time and save them in member variables, then use these codeinterfacescode when the codeDialogFragmentscode are requested to be created by the event. Same comments as above  seems wasteful creating every possible codeinterfacecode just in case it is run. strikeli liKeep some hacky open dialog state member variables in the Activity that guide the recreation of the codeinterfacescode. Hacky and creates a tie between the codeActivitycode and the codeDialogFragmentcode which isnt great practice.li ul  pAs you can see, all options involve recreation that is wasteful to some extent  is there a way to reuse the existing codeinterfacecode implementationp  pstrongEDITstrong Options 1 and 2 wont work because they need a link to the existing codeDialogcode. This is all doable but it is leaning more and more towards the hacked together option of having current Dialog variables, getting the codeDialogFragmentcode with codeFragmentManagercode when the activity is restarted, casting it appropriately based on the current Dialog variable, recreating the listener. Is there a less messy wayp

Negative 92859 pThis is a twopart question regarding nodetool repair and garbage collection.p  pLets consider a replication factor of 3 for all tables, and suppose reads and writes require two confirmations of success to succeed. Based on my understanding of Cassandra, a successful write or delete would never be in danger of being missed as long as a read requires at least two responses, accepting only only the latest timestamp. This makes sense to me, but is it correctp  pAs a closely related question, if I configure Cassandra never to perform GC, but still perform nodetool repair periodically, will this suffice to garbagecollect old tombstones Intuitively, a successfully repaired key range should not need to keep tombstones, so they could in theory be discarded when a repair is performed. Is this the casep  pIf my above two hypotheses are correct, it seems like we can achieve the followingp  ol liConsistent reads and writes with no resurrected data due to quorum reads and writes and avoiding GC completelyli liNo unbounded growth in stale tombstones due to periodically running nodetool repair, which hopefully performs GC if my above hypothesis is correctli ol

Negative 92859 pThis is my first question on Stack Overflow,so wish me luck. p  pI am doing a classification process over a Lucene index with java and i need to update a document field named category. I have been using Lucene 4.2 with the index writer updateDocument function for that purpose and its working very well, except for the deletion part. Even if i use the forceMergeDeletes function after the update the index show me some already deleted documents. For example, if I run the classification over an index with 1000 documents the final amount of documents in the index remain the same and work as expected, but when I increase the index documents to 10000 the index shows some already deleted documents but not all. So, how can I actually erase those deleted documents from indexp  pstrongHere is some snippets of my codestrong p  precodepublic static void mainString[] args throws IOException, ParseException      Preparing config data     File indexDir  new FileindexDir     Directory fsDir  FSDirectory.openindexDir      IndexWriterConfig iwConf  new IndexWriterConfigVersion.LUCENE42, new WhitespaceSpanishAnalyzer     iwConf.setOpenModeIndexWriterConfig.OpenMode.APPEND     IndexWriter indexWriter  new IndexWriterfsDir, iwConf      IndexReader reader  DirectoryReader.openfsDir     IndexSearcher indexSearcher  new IndexSearcherreader     KNearestNeighborClassifier classifier  new KNearestNeighborClassifier100     AtomicReader ar  new SlowCompositeReaderWrapperCompositeReader reader      classifier.trainar, text, category, new WhitespaceSpanishAnalyzer      System.out.printlnBefore     showIndexedDocumentsreader     System.out.printlnBefore      int maxdoc  reader.maxDoc     int j  0     for int i  0 i lt maxdoc i          Document doc  reader.documenti         String clusterClasif  doc.getcategory         String text  doc.gettext         String docid  doc.getdocid         ClassificationResultltBytesRefgt result  classifier.assignClasstext         String classified  result.getAssignedClass.utf8ToString          if classified.isEmpty ampamp clusterClasif.compareToclassified  0              Term term  new Termdocid, docid             doc.removeFieldcategory             doc.addnew StringFieldcategory,                     classified, Field.Store.YES             indexWriter.updateDocumentterm,doc             j                   indexWriter.forceMergeDeletestrue     indexWriter.close     System.out.printlnClassified documents count   j             System.out.println     reader.close      reader  DirectoryReader.openfsDir     System.out.printlnDeleted docs   reader.numDeletedDocs     System.out.printlnAfter     showIndexedDocumentsreader   private static void showIndexedDocumentsIndexReader reader throws IOException      int maxdoc  reader.maxDoc     for int i  0 i lt maxdoc i          Document doc  reader.documenti         String idDoc  doc.getdocid         String text  doc.gettext         String category  doc.getcategory          System.out.printlnId Doc   idDoc         System.out.printlnCategory   category         System.out.printlnText   text         System.out.println          System.out.printlnTotal   maxdoc  codepre  pI have spend many hours looking for a solution to this, someones say that the deleted documents in the index are not important and that eventually they will be erased when we keep adding documents to the index, but I need to control that process in a way I can iterate over the index documents at any time and that the documents I retrieve are actually the lived ones. Lucene versions previous to 4.0 had a function in the IndexReader class named isDeleteddocId that gives if a document has been marked has deleted, that could be just half of the solution to my problem but I have not found a way to do that with the version 4.2 of Lucene. If you know how to do that I really appreciate if you share it.p

Negative 92859 pI was performing some simple financial calculations in SQL Server when I discovered some odd behavior.  I was trying to convert a string of numbers to a decimal type.  While the string did not contain a decimal point, I knew from my specifications that the last 3 positions in the string were supposed to be behind the decimal point.p  pMy first approach was flawed, but went something like thisp  precodeselect convertdecimal11,3,894561231000 as TotalUnits codepre  pThis resulted in strong89456.000strong.  Performing the division before the cast resulted in the decimal parts being truncated.p  pSo I moved the division operation outside the cast, like thisp  precodeselect convertdecimal11,3,894561231000 as TotalUnits codepre  pThis resulted in an explosion of positions after the decimal point.  It returned strong89456.12300000strongp  pAccording to my decimal specification, I wanted 11 digits, with 3 of them behind the decimal point.  Now I have 13 total digits, with 8 behind the decimal.  What happenedp  pTo get what I want, I guess I have to double cast, like thisp  precodeselect convertdecimal11,3, convertdecimal11,3,894561231000 codepre  pwhich gives strong89456.123strong.p  pIt turns out no matter what I divide by, the resulting decimal point explosion is the same.  Is the division converting the datatype into a double or somethingp  pMy question is this Why is this happening, and is there a more elegant way to compensate for it, instead of doublecasting to decimal.p  pstrongEDITstrong I found this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2428312sqlservercastanddividesimilar questiona on SO, but it looks like they are again doublecasting.p

Negative 92859 pI just had this question on an final exam for an introductory CS course. I thought it was pretty interesting but I couldnt fully figure it out. I tried coding it out on Eclipse for a while and wasnt getting anywhere. I have a Biochem exam soon so I really should be studying for that but this is bugging me... Thought I would ask for help.p  pQuestion  Write an algorithm for the following  Given an input array, A, with 2 indices  start and stop  calculate the sum between the two. The array is sorted and all elements belong to the set 1, 2, 3. This algorithm must run in Ologn. So given an array 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3 with indices 1 and 5 it would return 11.p  pThis is what I have so farp  precodepublic static int findSumint[] a, int start, int stop       int sum  0      int temp[]  new int[4]     int mid  startstop2      while mid gt start  mid lt stop           if a[mid1]a[mid]  0              temp[mid1]  mid1             temp[mid]  mid             mid                  else              findSuma, start, mid             findSuma, mid1, stop                   for int i  4 i gt 0 i          if temp[i]  0              temp[i]  temp[i1]                   for int i  1 i lt 4 i          sum  itemp[i]temp[i1]          return sum  codepre  pDont know if my logic is correct at all but my idea was to look for indices in the array where the numbers shift and to do so in a recursive manner where I keep splitting the array into two parts. With these indices, I can determine the frequency in which the numbers appear and thus multiple the numbers by these frequencies and add those up to calculate the sum.p  pPretty sure my algorithm has numerous flaws in it...p

Negative 92859 pRecently, i have been thinking of how to get multiple drop zones to work with form input fields, considering that the individual drop zones are within their own forms. One very important thing that i need is that i need to ensure that the user has uploaded at least 1 file in ALL of the individual drop zones before heshe is allowed to submit the form. This is to actually facilitate validation, as i wouldnt like a situation whereby the user is allowed to submit, the data from the input fields gets posted to the database and then the user actually forgot to upload any files onto the dropzones. Similarly, doing it the other way round, by uploading the files first before sending info to the database may lead to a wastage of server space, if the form input submission fails. p  pI am currently using a jQuery validation system to validate my form fields, but i cannot find the best way to integrate all of these together. I was thinking maybe disable the submit button until both drop zones have at least one file in them, but i am not very sure how to achieve this. The jQuery plugin already prevents submission of form fields if they are not validated, but i havent found a way to integrate this with the drop zones as well, another possible way is for the drop zones to check whether the submit button has been disabled by the jQuery plugin, and only allow the uploading of files and form submission if it hasnt, however, the issue is i have 2 drop zones, and so integrating this might be an issue. p  pEnyos way of combining normal forms with drop zones will not work as there can only be one single preview at any one time within a drop zone classed form, and therefore, would not work. p  pAnyone has any idea of how to hack this out p

Negative 92859 pIn my project I want to send possibly large and frequent XML data to a custom server written in c. I dont want to use Apache and CGI because the data is too frequent to be starting a CGI process for every request. I would prefer if the data was recieved directly in the c code that will process the data and send a reply.p  pI started out by using libmicrohttpd for the c server but now I believe it wont be possible because it doesnt give access to the raw POST data. I started looking for another library but I cant seem to find a c library that does this. Can anyone suggest a c http server library that has access to the raw post datap  pHere is the code I intended to start with. It is one of the example files provided in the source code of libmicrohttpd. a hrefhttpsgnunet.orgsvnlibmicrohttpdsrcexamplespostexample.c relnofollowPost Example from libmicrohttpd libraryap  pEdit p  pA little more context.p  pFrom what I understand to access the post data in libmicrohttpd you create MHDPostProcessor function that gets called incrementally as the post data is received in chunks. But in the example below it only shows how to get post data in the form of key value pairs. But I cant see how to get the data from a post.p  pThe example implements the MHDPostProcessor as postiterator. See the definition of p  precodestatic int postiteratorvoid cls,        enum MHDValueKind kind,        const char key,        const char filename,        const char contenttype,        const char transferencoding,        const char data, uint64t off, sizet size  ... codepre  pin the example posted above.

And that is the reason we say Java doesnt support pass by reference because we just pass the value of reference variable to the functions. So we pass the reference by value.

Negative 92859 pI have set up a very simple Single View Application in Swift using iOS 8.1. I have added one UIImageView to the main view controller view. I am trying to use CAKeyframeAnimation to animate a sequence of images. I was originally using the UIImageView animationImages property which worked fine but I need to be able to know precisely when the animation finishes, hence the move to CAKeyframeAnimation. p  pMy code is as follows p  precodeclass ViewController UIViewController    IBOutlet weak var imageView UIImageView var animation  CAKeyframeAnimation  override func viewDidLoad      super.viewDidLoad      Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.      let animationImages[AnyObject]  [UIImagenamed image1, UIImagenamed image2, UIImagenamed image3, UIImagenamed image4]      animation  CAKeyframeAnimationkeyPath contents     animation.calculationMode  kCAAnimationDiscrete     animation.duration  25     animation.values  animationImages     animation.repeatCount  25     animation.removedOnCompletion  false     animation.fillMode  kCAFillModeForwards     self.imageView.layer.addAnimationanimation, forKey contents    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning      super.didReceiveMemoryWarning      Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.    codepre  pThe problem is that the animation does not display any images and I just receive a blank screen. Is there something I am missing in the above code How can I get the animation to displayp

Negative 92859 pWe  emhaskellersem  might all know what strongcabal hellstrong is. When trying to upgrade our application  library, we get a failure because of different versions installed and upper bounds that dont match.p  pI dont get it. I checked GHC installs packages as versionned. That means when you install codemtlcode for instance, you have several folders for codemtlcode, one per version installed. That sounds great, because we could install several versions of the same package, and depending on our upper bounds in our code.cabalcode, we could select the versions wed like to use.p  pHowever, in a lot of cases, GHC doesnt work that way. If you have an upper bound, like codemtl lt 4.2code, you wont be able to install codemtl4.2code or upper. And I dont get why. Why cabalghc doesnt say Yeah, I can install that, it doesnt break anything actually, because the project uses a version I already have, so Ill just keep using that versionp  pI guess theres a good reason for that, and maybe thats because of concurrent versions. If you use codemtl4.2code and you depend on a package that uses codemtl4.1code, youd need two versions at the same time, which mustnt be allowed. However, GHC could default to the lower version, and allow to install upper versions without breaking anything.p  pAnother point about that if doing so, I guess with a lot of versions, itll be hard to track which versions we are emreallyem using. Is there a way to check that I sometimes use the codev3code flag to get more information about whats going on, but something like codecabal deplistcodewould be great. Maybe it already exists with codeghcpkgcodep

Negative 92859 pI am currently trying to set up a system using ASP.NET and Entity Framework. So far, I have moved a portion of my securityuser roles code out of my website, and into my system, which is fine, and seems to be working well. I have two roles, Basically a super user, and another admin role which still has privileges, but not as many. The thing is, I dont want just anyone to be able to register for an account, so anyone who wants an account must be approved first, and then give a role. Is there any way of utilizing ASP.NET Identity with Entity Framework to do such a thing I am still pretty new to this, I have set up regular accounts but never had a need for approval first. any help would be greatly appreciated.p

And sctp will go thue state machine lookup table and run some function  for handling event in right state. If state CLOSED and sctp will get ASSOCIAT it will call sctpsfdoprmasoc event from user to kernel create init  and it will create INIT chunk.

Negative 92859 pi want to use my raspberry pi as a SIPVOIPPhone, just controlling the RPI via SSH.p  pI found some tutorials and it seems that Twinkle is one of the most useful apps for that. p  pSo i successfully installed twinkle on my RPI, one SPIClient on my AndroidPhone and for know i am able to send text messages from one to another. p  pThe thing is I have to use the Twinkel GUI with XServerforwarding currently using MacOS with X11 and iTerm. p  pBut i kind of want to automate the whole process, like using twinkle from command line, controll it with scripts etc. p  pSo, obviously twinkle is not made for that. there dont even is a documentation for the accountconfigfile, so i had to struggle through that x11forwardingstuffp  pSo, my final question is Is there comparable SIPclient for the RPI that can be controlled via CLIp  pany hint is highly appreciated. While googling this question i just found projects working with asteriskserver on the RPI or attaching displays to it  but thats not what i am looking for...p  pcheers and thanksp

Negative 92859 pI study MIPS and I see that 5 bits of the instruction is always 0 if the instruction is not a shift instruction. This seems like waste of resources and must it be done to enforce the simplicity of the regularity that all instreuctions have same length Why cant shift instruction be 5 bits longer and the rest of the instructions use the bits to handle more overflowp

Negative 92859 pfirst some background information p  pA user can fill out some input text boxes and upload multiple images in one upload field. After the form is submitted, the text from the text fields is saved in the DB with codethisgtXXXgtsavecode. Additionally the data in particular the images from the file upload is processed in the callback function codeafterSavecode. So far so good.p  pNow to the problemp  pIt seems that the callback function is called multiple times 1 time for each uploaded image. So the problem is, the first time is everything fine, but after that the codethisgtdatacode array is basically empty all text fields are code code so the callback function throws some exceptions because there is no data. I solved the problem by just checking with codeissetcode and so on but I think that is not solving the problem. p  pSo my question is, why is the callback function called multiple times and how can I prevent thatp  pstrongEditstrong Following some relevant code snippetsp  pControllerp  precode      if thisgtrequestgtispost  thisgtrequestgtisput           ifaidnull thisgtArticlegtcreate         if thisgtArticlegtsavethisgtdata              thisgtSessiongtsetFlashThe article has been saved, flashcustom             return thisgtredirectarraycontroller gt articles, action gt view, thisgtid          ... codepre  pModelp  pI think most of that is not relevant here..

Negative 92859 pI just learned about source control and tried using it  so I activated for a project via VS2013 and it works locally, but then I tried to set up a repository at GitHub.com. I used the default settings, which means https type connection there is only https or ssh, but when I copied the url of the repo to VS to publish to it, VS showed the following error An error occurred while sending the request.  I looked it up and almost all guides refer to opening a repo with an https type connection but there is no longer such option at gitHub.com, and I found the following article from Microsoft a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combphkelleyarchive20131020gitnetworkoperationsinvisualstudio2013.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combphkelleyarchive20131020gitnetworkoperationsinvisualstudio2013.aspxa  which explains why the error occurs and that some certificate needs to be added but I dont know how. So my question is is this the issue and how to solve it, or is there another way to use VS to upload the repo online to github.com or to some other place. p  pAlso  as I only stared using VS2013 for source control  are there third party extensions that give a better experience for source control in VS2013 or is the built it git support the best it getsp

Negative 92859 pI posted a question last night that after reading back sounded awful, so I deleted it and have come back to try again, this time properly.p  pI have a Flex Mobile App, that uses Parsley, everything works as expected but I am trying to do use a decoupled result handler in my controller, but it is not firing when I expect it to, so would like a pointer as to why.p  pThe command look like thisp  precodepublic function executevoid              var asyncTokenAsyncToken  Db.Instance.ViewChildrenmainModel.loggedInUser.userId         asyncToken.addRespondernew Responderresult, error           public function resultresultResultEventvoid              callbackresult.result           public function erroreventFaultEventvoid              callbackevent.fault      codepre  pWhich works as expected, the command is executed and the result handler handles the result, the problem comes when I try to put a message handler in the controller for the view. p  precode[CommandResult]         public function handleResultresultAsyncTokenvoid                      traceresult in the controller                  [CommandError]         public function handleErrorfaultAsyncTokenvoid                      traceerror   fault.fault.faultDetail          codepre  pNeither of these listeners fire when a result arrives, so I did the obvious thing and changed the code top  precode[CommandResult]         public function handleResultvoid                      traceresult in the controller                  [CommandError]         public function handleErrorvoid                      tracefault in controller          codepre  pNow it fires, but I have no data handle.p  pI did think of changing the commands execute method to p  precodepublic function executeAsyncToken  return Db.Instance.ViewChildrenmainModel.loggedInUser.userId  codepre  pas after all it does return an AsyncToken, but then the command doesnt fire at all it is part of a 2 command sequence that is mapped to an event called ChildEvent, this is the second and last event in the chain.p  pSo in summary, I want the above to work, but want to be able to manage the result in the decoupled result handler, but I cant work out how, the parsley manual is great for getting to this point a hrefhttpwww.spicefactory.orgparsleydocs3.0manualpagecommandsampsectionintro relnofollowhttpwww.spicefactory.orgparsleydocs3.0manualpagecommandsampsectionintroa, but the finer details are a little sketchy.p  pThanksp

Therefore I have two questionsp  ol liIf this requires me to set each newly registered user on the network to a specific role such as Contributor, how do I do that I have been unable to find a setting or addon to reliably set a default role on registration.li liIf I  have to write custom code to achieve this, what is the entry point I am happy to get my hands dirty, would just like to know where to start.li ol  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 92859 pHi I have this project that includes receiving real time data from a remote computer in OSC format, I want  then to be able to communicate or distribute the OSC data to other computers logged in the same network.p  pI am looking in NodeJS, Express, Socket.io and OSC.js I am not sure however how this should look in terms of the structure of the communication. If I am not misunderstanding some server concepts, I need to implement a NodeJS server which will receive it and forward it trough socket.io to the local network, I am ot sure though, do I get this data by looging to the server or to some other address that broadcasts the OSC datap  pThanksp  pK.p

I have set up my problem in excel, where I have a row for each attendee, and a binary column for my linear optimization programs changeable cells, where 1 is selected if the attendee is chosen for the VIP event and 0 otherwise.p  pWhat code can I then write to satisfy the above constraintsp  pWhat I have tried so far  p  pCurrently my only solution for dealing with the first constraint listed above is to have 50 additional binary columns one for each company where if an attendee is going to the VIP event and they are from the company represented in that particular column, it will list a 1, and 0 otherwise. Then have another 50 cells that sum each column and then set a constraint that says those cells must be less than or equal to 4. p  pI feel there must be a more elegant and efficient way of doing this however. p  pI also cannot currently think of a way to write the code to satisfy the second constraint. I have tried having a separate column that displays company names when the changeable cell equals 1, then counting the number of unique values in that column, and then applying a constraint to that cell such that it must be greater than or equal to 3, but apparently that is a nonlinear constraint. p
