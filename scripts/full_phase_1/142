Positive 142 pI wrote an ant org.apache.tools.ant.BuildListener that does stuff if the build fails. I can use it  from the command line with codeant listener org.smottguyz.antlisteners.SimpleListener buildallcode. But when I use the NetBeans IDE, there is no apparent way to specify a codelistenercode option.p  pIs there a way to specify an additional build listener with ant or NetBeans properties, settings or configuration somewherep  pEDIT. It turns out this is pretty NetBeans specific, because, for whatever reason, NetBeans disables most of the approaches that work for most ant configurations. So a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5721513isitpossibletospecifyloggerforantinsidebuildxmlIs it possible to specify logger for ant inside build.xmla is relevant, but not an answer p  pThanksp

Negative 142 pI am looking to stream a file housed in a SharePoint 2003 document library down to the browser.  Basically the idea is to open the file as a stream and then to write the file stream to the reponse, specifying the content type and content disposition headers.  Content disposition is used to preserve the file name, content type of course to clue the browser about what app to open to view the file.  p  pThis works all good and fine in a development environment and UAT environment.  However, in the production environment, things do not always work as expected,however only with IE6IE7. FF works great in all environments. p  pNote that in the production environment SSL is enabled and generally used.  When SSL is not used in the production environment, file streams, is named as expected, and properly dislays.p  pHere is a code snippetp  precodeSystem.IO.FileStream fs  new System.IO.FileStreamServer.MapPath.    test.doc, System.IO.FileMode.Open long byteNum  fs.Length byte[] pdfBytes  new byte[byteNum] fs.ReadpdfBytes, 0, intbyteNum  Response.AppendHeaderContentdisposition, filenameTestme.doc Response.CacheControl  nocache Response.ContentType  applicationmsword charsetutf8 Response.Expires  1 Response.OutputStream.WritepdfBytes, 0, pdfBytes.Length Response.Flush Response.Close fs.Close codepre  pLike I said, this code snippet works fine on the dev machine and in the UAT environment.  A dialog box opens and asks to save, view or cancel Testme.doc.  But in production onnly when using SSL, IE 6 amp IE7 dont use the name of the attachment.  Instead it uses the name of the page that is sending the stream, testheader.apx and then an error is thrown.  p  pIE does provide an advanced setting Do not save encrypted pages to disk.  p  pI suspect this is part of the problem, the server tells the browser not to cache the file, while IE has the Do not save encrypted pages to disk enabled.p  pYes I am aware that for larger files, the code snippet above will be a major drag on memory and this implimentation will be problematic. So the real final solution will not open the entire file into a single byte array, but rather will open the file as a stream, and then send the file down to the client in bite size chunks e.g. perhaps roughly 10K in size.p  pAnyone else have similar experience streaming binary files over ssl  Any suggestions or recommendationsp

Negative 142 pMany developers will claim that moving from one programming language to another is relatively simple especially if the languages are based on similar paradigms. However, in practice the effort comes not from learning the syntax of the language but in developing a deep understanding of the language nuances and more importantly knowing what is offered in the languages libraries. For example, switching from Java to .Net is not difficult from a syntactic perspective but programming efficiency requires a good knowledge of the available libraries. Switching from PHP to .Net could present an even greater hurdle given the language disparities.p  pWhat are the real overheads for a developer to move to a different language in the same paradigm What if the paradigms are differentp

Negative 142 pSorry for such a newbie question but there is something I do not quite understand the difference between a C reference and a pointer. They both point to a place in memory dont they The only difference I can figure out is that pointers are not as clever, cannot point to anything on the heap, are exempt from garbage collection, and can only reference struts or base types.p  pOne of the reasons I ask is that there is a perception that people need to understand pointers from C I guess well to be a good programmer. That a lot of people who leant higher level langauges miss this out and therefore have this weakness.p  pI just dont get what is so complex about a pointer It is basically just a reference to a place in memory is it not Can return its location, or can be used to interact that the object in that location directly p  pSo have a missed a massive pointp

Negative 142 pIm comfortable in the MySQL space having designed several apps over the past few years, and then continuously refining performance and scalability aspects.  I also have some experience working with memcached to provide application side speedups on frequently queried result sets.  And recently I implemented the Amazon SDB as my primary database for an ecommerce experiment.p  pTo oversimplify, a quick justification I went through in my mind for using the SDB service was that using a schemaless database structure would allow me to focus on the logical problem of my project and rapidly accumulate content in my datastore.  That is, dont worry about setting up and normalize all possible permutations of a products attributes before hand simply start loading in the products and the SDB will simply remember everything that is available.p  pNow that I have managed to get through the first few iterations of my project and I need to setup simple interfaces to the data, I am running to issues that I had taken for granted working with MySQL.  Ex grouping in select statements and limit syntax to query items 50 to 100.  The ease advantage I gained using schema free architecture of SDB, I lost to a performance hit of queryinglooping a resultset with just over 1800 items.p  pNow Im reading about projects like Tokyo Cabinet that are extending the concept of inmemory keyvalue stores to provide pseudorelational functionality at ridiculously faster speeds 14x i read somewhere.p  pMy question Are there some rudimentary guidelines or heuristics that I as an application designerdeveloper can go through to evaluate which DB tech is the most appropriate at each stage of my project.p  pEx  At a prototyping stage where logicaltechnical unknowns of the application make data structure fluid use SDB. At a more mature stage where user deliverables are a priority, use traditional tools where you dont have to spend dev time writing sorting, grouping or pagination logic.p  pPractical experience with these tools would be very much appreciated.p  pThanks SOp  pShaheeb R. p

Obviously, this gets very tedious very fast.p  pIs there any way to configure it where the port is immediately released as soon as the process is killed Either via some setting in linux, or in the makefile for my program, or even programmatically in Cp  pstrongEdit Im referring to when writing a server and choosing a specific port to host the program.strongp

Negative 142 pIm trying to set up an XSLIF statement that only shows entries that have a node that falls between two values. Simple enough, right Its just a if greater than and if less than. Problem is, instead of testing it against one node I need to test it against up to 52.p  pLets say I have some XML that looks like thisp  precodeltcontainergt     ltentrygt     ltitemgt1ltitemgt     ltitemgt2ltitemgt     ltitemgt3ltitemgt     ltitemgt4ltitemgt     ltitemgt5ltitemgt     ltitemgt6ltitemgt     ltitemgt7ltitemgt     ltitemgt8ltitemgt     ltitemgt9ltitemgt     ltitemgt10ltitemgt     ltentrygt ltcontainergt codepre  pNow say Im given a range of 915. Because some of the nodes fall into that range I want to display that entry. But if I was given a range of 1115 none of the nodes fit so I wouldnt want it displayed.p  pThe problem is... I have absolutely no idea how you would do this. I know you can IF a single value but I cant think of a simple way to test each node.p  pBy the way, this is all being done inside the latest stable release of the Symphony CMS.p  p[edit] The problem with the first two results is they display the ITEM nodes, what Im looking for is to return only ENTRY nodes that have at least one ITEM node that matches. Im not sure how any of the solutions would help this.p

In weblogic I was able to write my own policy xml file and instantiate my service with it see below, however I can not seem to figure out how to do the same using Metro.p  pPolicy.xmlp  precode ltxml version1.0gt        ltwspPolicy          xmlnswsphttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200409policy          xmlnssphttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwssxwssecuritypolicy200512gt          ltspSupportingTokensgt            ltwspPolicygt              ltspUsernameToken                spIncludeTokenhttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwssxwssecuritypolicy200512IncludeTokenAlwaysToRecipientgt                ltwspPolicygt                  ltspWssUsernameToken10gt                ltspHashPasswordgt              ltwspPolicygt              ltspUsernameTokengt            ltwspPolicygt          ltspSupportingTokensgt        ltwspPolicygt codepre  pClient.java Weblogicp  precode      ClientPolicyFeature cpf  new ClientPolicyFeature       InputStream asStream   WebServiceSoapClient.class.getResourceAsStreamPolicy.xml         cpf.setEffectivePolicynew InputStreamPolicySourceasStream         try                 webService  new WebServicenew URLhttp192.168.1.10WebServiceWebService.asmxwsdl, new QNamehttptestme.com, WebService              catch  MalformedURLException e                  e.printStackTrace               WebServiceSoap client  webService.getWebServiceSoapnew WebServiceFeature[] cpf            ListltCredentialProvidergt credProviders  new ArrayListltCredentialProvidergt           String username  user       String password  pass       CredentialProvider cp  new ClientUNTCredentialProviderusername.getBytes, password.getBytes            credProviders.addcp        MapltString, Objectgt rc  BindingProvider client.getRequestContext         rc.putWSSecurityContext.CREDENTIALPROVIDERLIST, credProviders  ...  codepre  pI am able to generate my Proxy classes using Metro however I can not figure out how to configure it to send the UsernameToken.

Negative 142 pI have a templated function that operates on a templatetype variable, and if the value is less than 0, sets it to 0.

Negative 142 pHow are you supposed to correctly use a Visual Studio Team System database project to implement version control on a sql server databasep  pThis might seem overly generic but everything Ive found so far online hasnt helped me in being able to achieve anything useful. I have managed to find functionality that appears to be similar to features that are in Redgates tool Sql Compare but it definitely didnt seem as intuitive as their product.p  pFrom my understanding of how these db projects are supposed to work is that youre able to have a version of the database that either lives in Team Foundation Server or inside the sql server itself that you can check out to your local machine work on it and then check in the new changes which would allow for simultaneous development to work normally as it does for coding. Was I misinformed Or is it just a complicated process to get setupp  pRelated is then how do you use it to deploy changes to the stagingproduction serversp

Negative 142 pso my company is finally going to rewrite some pages using jquery. They wanted some sort of a search panel, and when the user clicks on a search result it could be a plan, a project, an invoice, the result details will open in a new tab. all is good.p  peach search result can contain documents and they want to be able to drag a document from say a plan in one tab to a project in another tab. also they want to able to view 2 things at the same time, say, compare 2 invoices side by side.p  pby the very nature of the tab widget you are supposed to only see 1 tab at a time, so my gut feeling is that the tab widget is not the right tool for this. the accordion does not fit either, since you cannot keep 2 sections opened at the same time.p  pany ideasuggestion for a better UI interfacep
Negative 142 pThose outside of the ruby community and some inside oft reference ruby applications as being slow. For many of us this is an irrelevance, IO bound operations etc. However, when it does become a problem there is little to hold us back from taking advantage of native code to speed things up.

Negative 142 pI know, it has been made quite clear in a couple of questionsanswers before, that codevolatilecode is related to the visible state of the c memory model and not to multithreading.p  pOn the other hand, this a hrefhttpwww.drdobbs.comcpp184403766jsessionidOEWBPI10M2IQLQE1GHPCKHWATMY32JVNarticlea by Alexandrescu uses the codevolatilecode keyword not as a runtime feature but rather as a compile time check to force the compiler into failing to accept code that could be not thread safe. In the article the keyword is used more like a coderequiredthreadsafetycode tag than the actual intended use of codevolatilecode.p  pIs this abuse of codevolatilecode appropriate What possible gotchas may be hidden in the approachp  pThe first thing that comes to mind is added confusion codevolatilecode is not related to thread safety, but by lack of a better tool I could accept it.p  pBasic simplification of the articlep  pIf you declare a variable codevolatilecode, only codevolatilecode member methods can be called on it, so the compiler will block calling code to other methods. Declaring an codestdvectorcode instance as codevolatilecode will block all uses of the class. Adding a wrapper in the shape of a locking pointer that performs a codeconstcastcode to release the codevolatilecode requirement, any access through the locking pointer will be allowed.p  pStealing from the articlep  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class LockingPtr  public     Constructorsdestructors    LockingPtrvolatile Tamp obj, Mutexamp mtx        pObjconstcastltTgtampobj, pMtxampmtx     mtx.Lock     LockingPtr    pMtxgtUnlock      Pointer behavior    Tamp operator   return pObj     T operatorgt  return pObj  private    T pObj    Mutex pMtx    LockingPtrconst LockingPtramp    LockingPtramp operatorconst LockingPtramp   class SyncBuf  public    void Thread1        LockingPtrltBufTgt lpBufbuffer, mtx       BufTiterator i  lpBufgtbegin       for  i  lpBufgtend i            ... use i ...               void Thread2 private    typedef vectorltchargt BufT    volatile BufT buffer    Mutex mtx  controls access to buffer  codepre  pstrongNOTEstrongp  pAfter the first couple of answers have appeared I think I must clarify, as I might not have used the most appropriate words.p  pThe use of codevolatilecode is not because of what it provides at runtime but because of what it means at compile time. That is, the same trick could be pulled with the codeconstcode keyword if it was as rarely used in user defined types is as codevolatilecode is. That is, there is a keyword  that happens to be spelled volatile that allows me to block member function calls, and Alexandrescu is using it to trick the compiler into failing to compile threadunsafe code.p  pI see it as many metaprogramming tricks that are there not because of what they do at compile time, but rather for what it forces the compiler to do for you.p

Negative 142 pI know that similar questions have been asked all over the place, but Im having trouble finding one that relates directly to what Im after.p  pI have a website where a user uploads a data file, then that file is transformed and imported into SQL. The file could be up to 50mb in size, and some times this process can take 30 minutes or sometimes even longer.p  pI realise I need to palm off the actual work to another process, and poll that process on the web page.

Once its finished another response will tell the page to stop polling for status updates.p  pstrongqueries on final decisionstrongp  pok, so as I thought, it seems that a windows service is the best idea.

Negative 142 pI just installed the latest Silverlight 4 developer bits using the Web Platform Installer.  I tried to start a new Silverlight Business Application project in VB.NET, but the project wont compile out of the box.  For example, I get an error message to replace codeWebContextcode with codeWebClientcode.p  pWhat might be the problem with the Silverlight Business Application template Is it VB.NET Has it not been updated for Silverlight 4 Something elsep  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong I checked to see if the C version of the template compiles and it works just fine.  I dug around some more in the errors in the VB.NET version, and if I add a few random lines of code to the generated code thats throwing the error, and then delete the code, it will stop throwing errors. Before I make this fix, though, I see really odd errors like End Get must start with Get, even though the syntax of the generated code is just fine.  It seems like kicking the IDE in the side with a few lines of random code whips it into place, but I dont think I should have to do that.p

Negative 142 pI have a MySQL MYISAM table say tbl consisting of 2 unsigned int fields, say, f1 and f2. There is an index on f2 and the table is very large approximately 320,000,000 rows. I update this table periodically with approximately 100,000 new rows a week, and, in order to be able to search this table without doing an ORDER BY which would be very time consuming in realtime queries, I physically ORDER the table according to the way in which I want to retrieve its rows. p  pSo, I perform an ALTER TABLE tbl ORDER BY f1 DESC. I know I have enough physical space on the server for a copy of the table. I have read that during this operation, a temporary table is created and SELECT statements are not affected on the current rows. p  pHowever, I have experienced that this is not the case, and SELECT statements on the table that occur at the same time with the ALTER table are getting blocked and do not terminate. After the ALTER TABLE tbl completes about 40 minutes on the production server, the SELECT statements on tbl start executing fine again.p  pIs there any reason why the ALTER table tbl ORDER BY f1 DESC seems to be blocking other clients from querying tblp  pThanks in advance, Timp

If one was missing, that would be a catastrophic failure.p  pWhy do this, you might ask, if youre new to dimensional modeling, as I was this two days ago as of writing this.p  pWell, I will have a LOT of Incident records for each date. So the DateDimension table will be a lot smaller than the Incident table, and allow me to do things with NHibernate LINQ that would otherwise be difficult. For instance something like thisp  precode        var IncidentsPerWeekday  incidentRepository             .GroupByi gt i.DateDimension.Weekday             .Selectg gt new Tupleltint,intgtg.Key, g.Count             .ToList codepre  pGiving me a list of groups telling me how the incidents divide themselves among the weekdays. There are of course many different dimensions that can be added here, allowing me to pivot reports around a bunch of different parameters and create interesting reports.p  pHowever, there is one minor annoyance, and here we finally arrive at the real question.p  pThe DateDimension has a primary key which is basically the date it represents in a specific format. For April 30th 2011, it would look like thisp  p20110430p  pThis is done by using a custom IIdentifierGenerator in NHibernate. Since well only have a single record for each date, this is a fairly clean way to do it in my opinion.p  pAlso, it would be a quick way to let new Incident entities know the foreign key of the reference to their relevant DateDimension. Some factory would know that we extract this key from say the Incident.RegisterTime DateTime, then stuff it in the DateDimensionid column.p  pHowever, this is what I cant seem to find a way to do. Incident.DateDimension rightfully demands an entity reference. Which means I have to load it from the database right. Which could be too slow in certain import scenarios where I need to insert a LOT of Incident entities into the database in the shortest amount of time possible.p  pSure, I could probably do this for this particular example by executing some custom SQL each time I insert an entity, and allow NULL references. Its not ideal, but it could work.p  pHowever, is there a way to specify the foreign key of the DateDimension reference directly instead of setting it with a reference to a real, stored reference objectp  pThat would certainly rid me of a huge headachep  pThanks in advance for any insightp

Negative 142 pIve been working with Facebook for a while now, and am in constant battle with their poor documentation and buggy framework. My latest issue is a strange javascript loop that happens when I close a Feed popup window before its done loading. Ive been using the recommended Javascript SDK in an IFrame.p  pThis problem seems to be worst when replicated in Firefox.p  pGiven how poorly the facebook documentation is updated, Ive tried the two different ways they suggest to make a wall post. Both of these do the same thing.p  precodeFB.ui   method feed,  name Title,  link postLink,  picture imgLink,  caption Caption,  description Body,  message    FB.ui  method stream.publish,  message ,  targetid TargetUserId,  attachment     name Title,   caption Caption,   description Body,   href postLink,   media postMedia  ,  actionlinks [ text Title, href postLink]   codepre  pIm currently usng the former implementation because it seems to have fixed an issue with a facebook popup sometimes getting stuck on the loading icon.p  pThis method is wrapped in another thats invoked from a flash application embedded on the page. Also, this IFrame is running inside an FBML page with the fbiframe tag. Im using an FBML parent so I can use their invite control.p  pIf a user close the popup before it finishes loading, it looks like these three methods are being called in a tight loop. The three main javascript methods being hammered are resolveResolution, onload and doFragmentSend. Its also making an awful lot of requests to a hrefhttpstatic.ak.fbcdn.netconnectxdproxy.php relnofollowhttpstatic.ak.fbcdn.netconnectxdproxy.phpap  pThis issue can be replicated by accessing my application at a hrefhttpapps.facebook.commexemgame relnofollowhttpapps.facebook.commexemgameap  pTo access the game, youll need to use a beta key, so feel free to use one of thesep  precodeecd61a6ea554479cad88bea9b15facc2 b2c636f56e264ecfbbf0d26f0949258f cb18417f14d34547b15f12e78a51f275 b7b08e2a7cc246d6841283a7f8d23011 796becc08d92438eafdc45b75d09443c codepre  pThe easiest way to show this bug is to click on Smack Talk in the leaderboard and close the popup before it finishes loading.p

Negative 142 pOne of the beauties with Java EE 6 is the new dependency injection framework  CDI with the Weld reference implementation  which has prompted us to start migrating internally to JSR330 in an implementation agnostic manner, with the explicit target of being able to have a core jar which is frozen, and then being able to add extra jars providing new modules replacing functionality in the core jar.p  pI am now in the process of making the above work with Weld, and to be frank there is simply too much magic going on behind the covers.

So, what about windows How do I find the addresses of my needed DLL functions Dont these addresses change with every service pack upgradep      pThere are multitudes of ways to find the addresses of the functions that you need to use in your shellcode. There are two methods for addressing functions you can find the desired function at runtime or use hard coded addresses. This tutorial will mostly discuss the hard coded method. The only DLL that is guaranteed to be mapped into the shellcodes address space is kernel32.dll. This DLL will hold LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress, the two functions needed to obtain any functions address that can be mapped into the exploits process space. There is a problem with this method though, the address offsets will change with every new release of Windows service packs, patches etc.. So, if you use this method your shellcode will ONLY work for a specific version of Windows. Further dynamic addressing will be referenced at the end of the paper in the Further Reading section.p blockquote

Negative 142 pIve just started working with the basics of python socket networking.  As an exercise in understanding, Ive been trying to hash out a basic server that will ask its client for a file type, and upon receiving a string of the extension, ask for the actual file.

If every time a request comes in, the codeHTTPChannelcode object is initialized, wouldnt it be impossible in this kind of setup to create a call and response  I was thinking one could set flags for codehastypecode and codehasfilecode in the channel object, but since the accept inits it for each individual connection, the objects state is forgotten with every inidividual request.  I realize this setup is supposed to be a basic HTTPServer, but my question is, how could I edit it to setup something like what Ive described  Would the server object need to inherit asynchat itself and forego dispatcher completely  The channel object would have to have some state to know that the filetype has already been sent, and then ask for the binary of the file instead.  Im very curious to know what the cleanest possible implementation of this might look like.p  pThanks a ton  Im very new to sockets.  Please let me know if I havent been clear.p

Negative 142 pThere is a webpage which is having one textbox for every day.I am using iMacros firefox plugin to fill all textboxes.  As of now, my macro fills all textboxes from monday to friday with a desired value, and then it submits the page. The webpage is designed like, if it is not friday today then it displays the error and will not let you submit. But if somehow i could get what day is today and then somehow fill the text box of only that day and submit the page then it will work. I think this can be done if iMacros support javascript or any other scripting language.p  pSo first thing do it supports any scripting language at all If yes then please help me how to do this, or please share any tutorial for this.p

Negative 142 pIve got an interesting issue with combining jQuerys codemouseentercode and codemouseleavecode events with a call to codeappendcode.

A similar query was in place that selected the last 100 records and filtered them into categories, but for small numbers of categories with some being updated faster than others can lead to having the top 100 not consisting of members from every category, so to try to resolve that, I was looking for a way to select 2 records from each category or Nrecords assuming its the same percategory and for those 2 records to be the last entered.

Negative 142 pWe are building a WPF Prism application. We have different developers working on different module projects, and multiple modules are injected into the main Application Shell. The main application is also a separate project. We also want to be able to use the modules in different applications. We do not want to have to name the Regions with the same names in every application.p  pFor instance, say we have a module to be used in two different applications. In one application, its developer may name the modules region DetailsRegion, and in the other, its developer may name it ResultsRegion.p  pEvery example I can find registers the View with the Region by hardcoding the region name emin the modules class definitionemp  precodemyRegionManager.RegisterViewWithRegionRegionNameHere, GetTypeModuleViewType codepre  pWhat I want to do is put the Region name in the main applications app.config file, and pass this name to the module. Something like thisp  pIn the main Shell Applications app.configp  precodeltModulesgt    ltSearchModulegt        ltadd keyRegionName valueSearchRegion gt     ltSearchModulegt ltModulesgt codepre  pAnd in the modules class filep  precodeDim settings As NameValueCollection  CTypeConfigurationManager.GetSectionModulesSearchModule, NameValueCollection Dim regionName as string  settingsRegionName myRegionManager.RegisterViewWithRegionregionName, GetTypeSearchModuleType codepre  pIn a way, this would be the last step to completely decouple the modules from the shell and from each other. p  pThis works perfectly in the strongemviewsemstrong of the module. But I cannot do it in the modules strongemclass definitionemstrong file, as ConfigurationManager is not available at that level.p  pI can do this by putting the region name in the ApplicatonSettings section of the emmodulesem app.config. But this defeats the purpose of being able to store the module in one location to be loaded by multiple applications. It really needs to be in the emmain applicationsem app.config.p  pIs there a way to register a modules View with a Region, without hardcoding the name of the Region in the code We try so hard NOT to hardcode anything. Is it truly necessary herep

Negative 142 pIm looking for a new version control system for my software company, which is fairly small.  Thus far, I have been using CVS, but I am a little bit OCD about reorganizing file structures all the time, and as a result, I seem to always be at version 1 of all my code since changing directory names throws CVSs versioning out the window.  Is there a version control system that is more aimed at the development phases where the project directory tree is constantly changing or do I need to buckle down and start writing my own  Basically, I need it to track versions of files based on something other than its physical file path, so that moves do not impact a files version information.

Negative 142 pI have a legacy CVS repository that I want to convert using cvs2svn. Ive used cvs2svn to do a test conversion and ran into an issue Im not sure how to resolve.p  pThe problem is that only some directories in the CVS repo are branched. Some common directories including the root project directory and Makefile are always left on HEAD. This looks something likep  precodeprojectMakefile               always on HEAD projectbar                   HEAD, Release01, Release02, etc projectconfig                always on HEAD projectfoo                   HEAD, Release01, Release02, etc projectMakerules             always on HEAD projectMakerulesRelease01   always on HEAD, defines branches for Release01 among other things projectMakerulesRelease02   always on HEAD, defines branches for Release02 among other things codepre  pWhen I run a cvs2svn conversion I get all the right branches, but the shared always on HEAD files are missing. These files should instead be present with the contents they had on HEAD at the time of the branch commit.p  pIm not sure if it helps or not, but official builds made on any branch tag all of the files used in the build with a monotonically increasing build number that is, build123 is a tag that includes a bunch of files from HEAD, and build124 is a Release01 build that includes a mix of files from HEAD and the Release01 branch, and build125 is back to all HEAD files.p  pI am converting to git, but the issue should apply to any output repository. If there is a solution that only works when converting to svn, I can do a twostep conversion.p  pI see three possible ways to approach thisp  ol lisome combinations of options andor custom code for the cvs2svn step to fill each nonHEAD branch with the files that existed on HEAD at the time of the revisionli lisome sort of postprocessing of the cvs2svn output before the import into gitli liuse gitfilterbranch to rewrite the git history after the import into gitli ol  pAm I missing an easy solution Should I just accept the imperfect import and move on There is only one active branch other than HEAD right now, but it would be useful to have a full and accurate history to refer too.p
Negative 142 pI have a weird issue with an jQuery AJAX jQuery request. When we generate reports on our site, it can take a while, so we have a status bar that we update with polling. However, what Im seeing is that these requests seem to be timing out and resending  a very weird behavior.p  pHeres the workflow User puts in their email address and clicks Get Report Button triggers the AJAX request see below.  After making the AJAX request, we send a second, simpler request, to poll a checkStatus function. This function returns a JSON string to a callback that updates the status bar on the screen. In the original AJAX requests success property, we have set a flag to stop the polling, so when the report completes, the polling stops and the last status update reflects that its finished.p  pThis works perfectly, except for one small problem. Im finding that when we have big reports, it seems to send a second getReport request without the user actually doing anything. I can tell this because our status will get to about 700 out of 1000 rows, and then jump back to 15 out of 1000 then 710 out of 1000 then 25 out of 1000, indicating that two reports are being generated simultaneously and updating the status flag with different statuses. p  pAll I can figure is that the original getReport AJAX request is being resent for some reason. Is there some timeout or something that Im not aware ofp  pHeres the codep  precodevar update  false   Function triggered by user when requesting report function getreport       if  reportEmail.val           alert  Please enter a valid email address to send the report to.          return           var dataStr  emailreportEmail.val      report.html  ltbgtYour report is being generated and will be emailed to you momentarily.ltbgt      .ajax                        type POST,         data dataStr,         url reportsroster15,         success function  update  false              completed.css  width,0      update  true     setTimeout  checkStatusregroster, updateStatusBar, 10     Call back from the checkStatus function function updateStatusBar  data       response  jQuery.parseJSONdata     if  response           statusBar.show         completed.css  width, response.completed          msg.html  response.message          if  update  true              setTimeout  checkStatusregroster, updateStatusBar, 1000         Polling function to check status function checkStatustype, callback  .ajax           type POST,         async false,         data amptypetype,         url statuscheck,         success callback                        codepre

Negative 142 pWell its late so I assume Im just exhausted but Ive been trying to work through this for about an hour now and I cant find a solution that works for me. Basically the code queries the database to find out how many people are in a game, it then does a little bit of math to compare points between people. Afterwards it populates an array with an id unique to the player and their points. Now the problem is is that Im trying to compare the array that has the list of people and their points with an array that holds the points the players will be awarded depending on their rank. I cant seem to find out how to pull the two arrays together and distribute points accordingly.

The first array is comprised of a list of users unique ids and points from a match. The player that has the most points from the match is 1. Now my second array carries data that is comprised of a list of 25 numbers. Each number represents a ranking in the match. 1 is for the best player and 25 is for the worst. each rank has a DIFFERENT set of points that are going to be added to a players running total. The points from the first array are only used to determine where the player ranks overall for the match.p  pFor example.p  pPlayer 1 gets 240 points in one match. Player 2 gets 180 points. Player 3 gets 210. And so on and so forth.p  pThis means Player 1 took 1st place. Player 3 took 2nd place. Player 2 took 3rd place.p  pNow lets say that the second array looks like thisp  p1  500 2  300 3  100p  pPlayer 1 gets 500 points. Player 2 gets 100 points. Player 3 gets 300 points.p  pI hope this makes it a bit more clear.p

Negative 142 pI would like to discuss potential kind of asynchronous Overlapped IO implementations in Windows, because there are many ways to implement this. Overlapped IO in Windows provides the ability to process data asynchronously, ie the execution of the operations are nonblocking.p  pstrongEditstrong The purpose of this question is the discussion about improvement of my own implementation on the one hand, and the strongdiscussion of alternate implementationstrong on the other hand. What asynchronous IO implementation would make most sense on parallel heavy IO, what make most sense in small mostly single threaded application.p  pI will cite a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms68635828vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMSDNap  blockquote   pWhen a function is executed synchronously, it does not return until the operation has been completed. This means that the execution of the calling thread can be blocked for an indefinite period while it waits for a timeconsuming operation to finish. Functions called for overlapped operation can return immediately, even though the operation has not been completed. This enables a timeconsuming IO operation to be executed in the background while the calling thread is free to perform other tasks. For example, a single thread can perform simultaneous IO operations on different handles, or even simultaneous read and write operations on the same handle.p blockquote  pI assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concept of overlapped IO.p  pAnother solution for asynchronous IO are completions ports, but this shall not be the subject of this discussion.

Negative 142 pIm using Grails 2.0.4 and elasticsearch 0.19.8, with a homegrown build of the elasticsearchgrails plugin to use 0.19.8, running on a micro Ubuntu instance of EC2.p  pIm building my grails project locally as a war.  When I drop this was in a jetty container locally on my laptop, jetty starts and Im able to navigate to the root context as expected and get my site.p  pHowever, when I take the same war confirmed via md5sum in the same version of jetty confirmed via md5sum on a micro EC2 instance, I get strange results.p  pOccasionally, jetty starts and my application is available...all is well.  But then other times, jetty wont start...and the logs are complaining about elasticsearch.p  pNow, Im the first to admit that running both elasticsearch and jetty with a grails war on the same node is, well, not the greatest idea...but, this is a test environment, and Im okay with swapping to disk not a perf testing lab.p  pBut, whats driving me batty is the inconsistency in running my application.  Currently, I cannot get it to start which, I suppose, counters my inconsistency argument.  But even taking a starting war, with MINIMAL changes in the war no domain object changes, just changes in controller andor view, my app wont start  complaining about elasticsearch.p  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.com3205132 relnofollowHeres the gistap  pIn the past, Ive solved this by stopping elasticsearch, and blowing away codevarlibelasticsearchelasticsearchcode which is basically, as I understand it, a crude way of blowing away the elasticsearch index.p  pBut now, this doesnt appear to be working.  Neither does uninstallreinstall elasticsearch.p  pCan anybody offer any advice on what to look for andor where to lookp

Negative 142 pI have a working vba.net project which runs successfully on my host computer through the console. Ive published it, installed it on other computers, and run it successfully on those machines. I have installed xampp which is necessary for the php to run behind the scenes as well, and again, everything runs perfectly.p  pHowever, this morning, I went to install it on another computer and something weird occurred. One of the labels on the window, overlapped into a text field. This sounds somewhat harmless, but the result was that the user could not use the text field, and so the app will not work. p  pBasically my question then is, is there some way to limit the formatting so that it will work on all computers I find this odd to ask, since the questionable computer is a windows 64 bit operating system as is the computers Ive installed on and the computer Im currently onp

Negative 142 pI am quite computerilliterate, but I have managed to utilize the Django framework on my own machine. I have had an account on Amazon Web Service AWS for some time, but it appeared rather complex to setup and to make use of, so I put it of for a while. Then I decided to give it a try, and it was not so hard as I first thought to load a AMI and connect to the server with PuTTY. But since I were already using BitNamis DjangoStack, I decided to take a look at their hosting offer which builds on AWS. Since they appeared to offer oneclick deployment, I set up a new server through their interface. But then, it seems like the oneclick deploymentpromise is with regard to the server itself. There does not seem to be any interface for deploying Django projects through their site. Having used PuTTY already, and adding WinSCP to my machine, I can acceess the server and load my Djangocode unto the server. But then I am lost. The documentation seems a bit thin look a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevhowtodeploymentwsgi relnofollowherea.p  pThe crux of this is the following Can anyone make this part of the process more understandable. I.e., how to deploy a Django project on a Linux server with ApachemodWSGIp  pThe other question is I want to use Postgres. Am I free to install this on the server. Should I opt for EBM EMB for this, or what is the downside of not having EBMp  pI hope I am not too unworthy of your attention, thanks p

Negative 142 pIve been trying to solo this one myself, but Ive hit a brick wall. I have a collection of 6 different Google Charts all on one page in a jQuery slider. Everything is perfect when viewed in Chrome, but its glitchy inside FF and IE. In FF and IE, the first framed Google Chart is fine, but when you advance the slider to a different Google Chart, the legend, hAxis, and vAxis titles are thrown off. When the charts are outside the slider, the graphs are fine. Im figuring its some kind of CSS conflict, but I havent figured it out yet. Ive been FireBugging like crazy and cant get a solution. The one thing Ive noticed in the iframe that Google creates to produce the Google Chart is the consistency of the x amp y aligned by the text tag it uses. Its actually different when inside the jQuery slider. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. The first link below is the Google ChartjQuery slider combo. The second is the Charts without the slider.p  pWith slider a hrefhttpwww.burlingtonweather.comcurrentweatherconditions.phpcityzip05401 relnofollowhttpwww.burlingtonweather.comcurrentweatherconditions.phpcityzip05401ap  pWithout Slider a hrefhttpwww.burlingtonweather.comcurrentold.phpcityzip05401 relnofollowhttpwww.burlingtonweather.comcurrentold.phpcityzip05401ap  pPS...yes I did try a totally different slider and I got the same result p

Negative 142 pI understand that a connection pool can have 100 physical connections by default. How many pools can be created in ADO.NET Does it related to the available memory of the machine. p  pIve learnt that the implementation for connection pooling is based on the provider so how SQL data providers connection pooling work will be different from how Oledbs connection pooling. Ref a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary8xx3tyca.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary8xx3tyca.aspxa The default max physical connections for a pool is 100. If we have different connection strings or different string order but same database or different windows identity if we are using windows authentication, new connection pool will be created. but I am looking for the information about how many connection pool can be created... p  pPlease let me know if you are not clear what Im asking or need more information. p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 142 pI have a small question regarding how the UI Thread a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidecomponentsprocessesandthreads.html relnofollowworksa. p  blockquote   pFor instance, when the user touches a button on the screen, your apps UI thread dispatches the touch event to the widget, which in turn sets its pressed state and posts an invalidate request to the event queue. The UI thread dequeues the request and notifies the widget that it should redraw itself.p blockquote  pSo what I understand is that the Button sets it state pressed to true, but what does it mean to post an invalidate request to the event queue. Does this simply mean that the button is telling the UI Thread that I have set my state pressed to true. And why does the button not draw it self after setting it state pressed to true Why does the UI Thread have to tell it to redraw itself I dont know how acurate this is a hrefhttpwww.rvasa.comandroidLecture09L09UIThread6pp.pdf relnofollowherea, but it gives a slightly better pictorial of the UI thread event dispatch thread. Can anyone explain why the Widgets call invalidate to the Dispatch queue, and the UI thread asks the widget to redraw it self p

Negative 142 pI have a requirement for users to edit a list of quotes for a lead, the quotes can be different types such asp  ul liQuoteForProductTypeA li liQuoteForProductTypeBli ul  pAll quote types share a common base class, such as QuoteBase.p  pI have my quotes displaying fine on the front end, and appear to post back the correct data  too.p  pHowever, on the server it doesnt obviously doesnt know which subclass to use, so just uses the base class.p  pI think i need some kind of custom model binder for WebApi to check for a hidden field such as ModelType which contains the type of the object in the collection, the model binder then creates a new object of this type and binds the properties from my posted values to this object.p  pHowever, i am stuck at this point with very little documentation  blogs on how to do this.p  pI have checked the source code for WebApi to see if i can extend a default model binder, but any defaults are sealed classes.p  pI can only implement IModelBinder by the looks of it, i can create the correct model type by looking for a value called ModelType, but then im not sure how to fill the rest of the values in my subclasses, if there was a default model binder i was inheriting from i would just call the base classes bind method.p

Negative 142 pI am a newbie in Android  I have some huge problems with Androids SDK, as Im developing an app that uses huge bitmaps  1200  1000 and the problem is during the app I need multiple layersbitmaps of the same size 35 of them. The problem is memory heap is consumed very quickly on one of these allocations and OutOfMemory exception is triggered. p  pThe good part is that I dont need all of the bitmaps in the same time.p  pI tried the recycle method calling, although I understood its obsolete, as the memory for the bitmap now resides on the heap, not on the native memory. I also tried to remove all references from a specific bitmap and even call System.gc manually but no use, the bitmap couldnt be removed. Ok, maybe there would be memory leaks I dont know about, although I doubt it.p  pI tried all sorts of solutions and none of them work.p  pThe best choice for me would have been to reuse a bitmap, but the decode method of BitmapFactory does only know to allocate a new Bitmap which consumes memory.p  pMy question is, do you know a method of reusing the bitmaps pixels overwrite a bitmaps pixels without allocating another Bitmappixels array that can work with Android  the problem is I cant reside on a GarbageCollector solution because I have specific moments in my app when I have to be certain those bitmaps are removed from memoryother bitmaps wont be allocated.p  pAnother solution would be do you know a method of drawing some bitmaps directly on sdcard, without passing through the heap memory On of the moments it crashes it when I try to allocate a big bitmap double of the original size to concatenate two other processed bitmaps ... thats why Im asking. Could there be a possibility to instantiate a Canvas r other drawing object directly from a data stream p  pOther solution would be to make use of something like virtual swap memory which would simulate heap memory but with caching on SDCARD or something. But cant find a way on doing this also.p

Negative 142 pIm building a bunch of forms that have labels and corresponding fields input element or more complex elements. p  pLabels go on the left, fields go on the right. Labels in a given form should all be a specific width so that the fields all line up vertically.p  pThere are two ways maybe more of achieving thisp  ol lipemstrongRowsemstrong Float each label and each field left. Put each label and field in a fieldrow divcontainer. Set label width to some specific number. With this approach labels on different forms will have different widths, because theyll depend on the width of the text in the longest label.pli lipemstrongColumnsemstrong Put all labels in one divcontainer thats floated left, put all fields in another floated left container with paddingleft set. This way the labels and even the label container dont need to have their widths set, because the column layout and the paddingleft will uniformly take care of vertically lining up all the fields.pli ol  pSo approach 2 seems to be easier to implement because the widths dont need to be set all the time, but I think its also less object oriented, because a label and a field that goes with that label are not grouped together, as they are in approach 1. Also, if building forms dynamically, approach 2 doesnt work as well with functions like codeaddRowlabel, fieldcode, since it would have to know about the label and the field containers, instead of just creatingadding one fieldrow element.p  pWhich approach do you think is better Is there another, better approach than these twop

Negative 142 pI have following snippet in a stored procedure. The procedure is called from an insert trigger.p  precodevProdName VARCHAR2250 vID VARCHAR250 vClob CLOB  ....

However there is an issue with the CLOB insert above. If multiple rows are inserted quickly after each other example import from csv with sql developer insert method or WebMethod I assume inserts happen in same transaction the CLOB has for all rows the value of the first inserted rows. All others eg id, ProdName have the correct value.p  pTherefore it seems the Clob is somehow cached. Is that true How can I fix that behaviorp  pEDITp  pExamplep  precodeDECLARE   ... variables     vid varchar215  BEGIN   assign values to vars, one of them is an ID on which CLOB is selected      in the procedure     vid  754564  myprocedurevid, args       if this commit in uncommented, it works as expected.      eg. the 2 inserted rows have different values for the clob field  COMMIT    assign other values to vars especially different id      gt result should have a different value in CLOB field             vid  5356976  myprocedurevid, args  END codepre  pNote that all other fields selected based in vid have the correct value regardless if the COMMIT is made or not So it is an issue with CLOB not the procedurep

What I want to do is once I detect there is a person player exists in front of the camera, strongemI would extract the depth pixels of the player only, and put it onto a transparent background, so that the output is a static image of the depth image of the player only, on a transparent background.emstrongp  pI would like to ask strongemis it possible to do the jobemstrong Ive done some research and find some functions may help to do so like SkeletonToDepthImage or  the depth pixel data which includes the distance and player index.p  pAny suggestions will be appreciated Thank you so muchp
Negative 142 pI am doing some maintenance work on a linkedtable application in Microsoft Access 2010 and experiencing this little gem of a problem.  The application is linked to a SQL Server 2008 database.  The application has a main form that allows a user to choose a combination of park code and resource and pops up an edit form for the details of that particular combination. If that combo doesnt exist in the database, the application inserts a new record in, but the issue is that 2 records get inserted.p  pHeres the seat of the problem code, it gets called when I need to insert a new record in a details popup formp  precodePrivate Sub NewRecunitcode As String, resource As String, sql As String     DoCmd.RunSQL INSERT INTO PARKRESOURCES unitcode, resource, sensitivity VALUES       amp  amp unitcode amp , amp resource amp ,public     Force an explicit save    httpwww.pcreview.co.ukforumsupdatecancelupdatewithoutaddneweditt1150554.html    If Me.Dirty Then       Me.Dirty  False    End If     Me.RecordSource  sql End Sub codepre  pCreating a new record results in 2 records getting inserted into the Recordset.  It doesnt seem to matter if I move the explicit save code before or after setting the RecordSource.  In either order and stopping after either produces 2 new records inserted in the database verified by querying in SSMS.  p  pWhen I set the RecordSource property and step through the code, the event chain looks like Me.RecordSource  sql  FormBeforeUpdate  FormAfterUpdate  FormAfterInsert  FormCurrent.  The duplicate is not present at the close of BeforeUpdate, but by the time I get to AfterUpdate, the duplicate has already been inserted.  What happens between BeforeUpdate and AfterUpdate that causes this to happen  p  pAccording to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryofficeff83539728voffice.1429.aspx relnofollowMSDN, the order isa BeforeInsert  BeforeUpdate  AfterUpdate  AfterInsert.  They also state that setting the value of a control through Visual Basic doesnt trigger these events.  But when I update the RecordSource in code, the last 3 events certainly fire BeforeInsert is the only one that a stepthrough doesnt stop on.p  pAs per Daniel Cooks request, here is the calling code. p  precodePrivate Sub FormLoad    On Error GoTo ErrFormLoad     Me.KeyPreview  True    If Not IsNullMe.OpenArgs Then       ProcessOpenArgs Me.OpenArgs       Me.lblHeader.Caption  Me.unitcode amp  Resource   amp Me.resource    Else       Me.lblHeader.Caption  Information Needs    End If    ... error trapping End Sub codepre  pAnd the ProcessOpenArgs sub OpenArgs get set as parkresourcep  precodePrivate Sub ProcessOpenArgsopenargs As String    On Error GoTo ErrProcessOpenArgs     Dim Args As String    Args  Splitopenargs,      Me.unitcode  Args0    Me.resource  Args1     Check to see if there are records in the database for current unitresource combo    Dim rs As DAO.Recordset    Dim sql As String    sql  SELECT  FROM PARKRESOURCES  amp      WHERE resource amp Me.resource amp  AND unitcode amp Me.unitcode amp     Set rs  CurrentDb.OpenRecordsetsql, dbOpenDynaset, dbSeeChanges     if there arent, create a new record    If rs.RecordCount  0 Then       NewRec Me.unitcode, Me.resource, sql    Else go to the current listing       Me.RecordSource  sql    End If  ExitProcessOpenArgs    Exit Sub ErrProcessOpenArgs    MsgBox Err.Number amp Err.description    Resume ExitProcessOpenArgs End Sub codepre  pI will continue to comb through the event documentation and as a last resort I may go totally nuts and just stick every possible event in my VBA code and step through them, but does anyone know what could be happening to cause the duplicatesp

Negative 142 pI am using a custom network protocol library. This library is built on TCPIP and is supposedly to be used in high frequency messaging. It is a nonblocking library and uses callbacks as the interface to integrate with the caller.p  pI am no performance expert, and that is why I decided to ask this question here. The custom library comes with a particular constraint, outlined belowp  blockquote   pCallee should not invoke any of the librarys API under the context   of the callback thread. If they attempt to do so, the thread will   hangp blockquote  pThe only way to overcome API restriction is that I start another thread which process message and invokes the library to send a response. The library thread and process thread would share a common queue, which would be protected by a mutex and use codewaitnotifycode calls to indicate the presence of a message. p  pIf I am receiving 80k messages per second, then I would be putting threads to sleep and waking them up pretty often, performing thread context switches 80k times per second.p  pPlus, as there are two threads, they will not share the message buffer in the L1 cache. The cache line containing the message would first be filled by the librarys thread, then evicted and pulled into the process threads cores L1 cache. Am I missing something or is it possible that the librarys design is not meant for high performance use casesp  pstrongMy questions arestrongp  ol lipI have seen the warnings like Dont use this API in a callbacks context as it can cause locks. across many libraries. What are the common design choices that cause such design constraints They can use recursive locks if it is a simple question of same thread calling the lock multiple times. Is this a reentrant issue, and what challenges might cause an API owner to make non reentrant APIpli lipIs there a way in the above design model, where the library thread and process thread can share the same core, and consequently share a cache linepli lipHow expensive are volatile codesigatomictcodes as a mechanism to share data between two threadspli lipGiven a high frequency scenario, what is a lightweight way to share information between two threadspli ol  pThe library and my application are built on C and Linux.p
Negative 142 pI have a local LAMP stack running on Linux.

These files may be edited using a simple editor that I have written within the application.

I need this to be done for a percentage width element. I feel like I have tried everything, but there must be a solution, even if it is a hack. The best solution that I have found so far is to use a hrefhttpcode.google.comphyphenator relnofollowhyphenator jsa. It works beautifully for most long words EXCEPT it only seems to work on real words that can be found in a dictionary file. For example, this is broken up nicely in all my examplesp  pThisisalongstringoftextandifIwasusinghyphenatorjsonthisthenitwouldbreakupnicelywithhyphensandeverythingwouldbegoodp  pThings like these do not get broken and instead it breaks my sitep  pababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababp  pp  pMost sites that I want to use this on allow user created text to appear on the site, and things like the long string of equal signs and hyphen characters are common. I also notice that stackoverflow combats this problem by using the wordwrap breakword css at least in firefox. I have experimented with this and found that it works great, but only works when using predefined pixel widths and I need a solution that works with percentage widths. I have also used wordwrap breakall which works but it looks ugly because it cuts small words off in the middle when it should wrap the word instead.p  pIf possible I would like to continue using hyphenator as it works great most of the time. Maybe I have been looking at this too long, but is there some sort of options in hyphenator that I can set to make it break up nonwords like those above that are too big Maybe someone has had some success with adjusting hyphenators regex to make this happenp
Negative 142 pIm using tablesorter to paginate results in a table.  Ive also got a tooltip on one of the columns to show the time it was approved.  The first 10 results in the table loaded by default will display the tooltip correctly.  If I switch to the next page, hovering will show the default browser title tooltip, instead of the one being triggered by JS.  I believe this is because of the way the JS is being loaded, and not for the content that is initially hidden by the pagination.  Heres how Im calling the tooltipp  precodedocument.readyfunction                        if [reltooltip].length                       [reltooltip].tooltip                                           codepre  pAnd just to show the linksp  precodeThis link displays my fancy tooltip correctly lta href stylecolor000 reltooltip titleMonday January 28th 2013 1211 PMgt  This link does not lta href stylecolor000 reltooltip titleMonday January 28th 2013 0125 PMgt codepre  pLike I said the only difference between the two rows is that one is loaded when the page loads, the other is triggered by either changing the amount of rows visible on the page, or going to the next page which by the way is JS, doesnt actually change page location.  The rows are generated from MySQL, while the first ten work, none after that do. Is my conclusion correct  Could I be missing something else  Thanks for any advicep  pEdit  I would add that, contributing to my confusion, the paginator does not actually hide the rows from the html source.  It just does not display them in the browser window.  p

Negative 142 pIm trying to work with raw audio data for manipulation and playback with OpenAL. So far everything works nice and dandy since Ive written my own .wav file reader and have been working with that. However, my goal is for people to import their own music. This implies that my program should support various audio formats and codecs, including atleast MP3, Ogg and FLAC.p  pNow unlike reading a .wav file, the other formats arent as straightforward. Now I could possibly write my own readers and  or use wrappers of various existing libraries such as libsnd and the ogg library, but Id rather not reinvent the wheel. So my question is is there a library already that allows fetching the raw byte audio data from various formats in Monop  pIve taken a look at NAudio, but its highly dependant on various Win32 API calls, which is a nogo for me as I intend to make my program multiplatform. At the moment I only care about getting the data for reading and playback purposes, I do not intend to manipulate, mix, or any other kind of computational work.p  pstrongEDITstrong One important factor I forgot was licensing. Id prefer an MIT based licensing or other open license that allow me to use the library for free in commercial software. The BASS.Net library for example is out of the question, as licensing the library is out of my budget.p  pstrongEDIT2strong irrKlang does not support Mono.p

How can I do thisp  pSchematically, my view models currently look like thisp  precodepublic class SetupGameViewModel  NavigationViewModelBase      public SetupGameViewModelINavigationService ns  basens        public IObservableCollectionltPlayergt Players  get set       public void StartGame               This is as far as Ive got...         base.NavigationService.NavigateToViewModelltGameViewModelgt           How can I pass the Players collection from here to the GameViewModel        public class GameViewModel  NavigationViewModelBase      public GameViewModelINavigationService ns  basens        public ScoreBoardViewModel ScoreBoard  get private set       public void InitializeScoreBoardIEnumerableltPlayergt players              ScoreBoard  new ScoreBoardViewModelplayers       codepre  pIdeally, I would like to call codeInitializeScoreBoardcode from within the codeGameViewModelcode constructor, but as far as I have been able to tell it is not possible to pass the codeSetupGameViewModel.Playerscode collection to the codeGameViewModelcode constructor.p  pThe codeINavigationService.NavigateToViewModelltTgtcode extension method optionally takes an code[object] parametercode argument, but this parameter does not seem to reach the view model constructor navigated to. And I cannot figure out how to explicitly call the codeGameViewModel.InitializeScoreBoardcode method from the codeSetupGameViewModel.StartGamecode method either, since the codeGameViewModelcode has not been initialized at this stage.p

Negative 142 pToday I ran into a seemingly simple styling task when using the Select2 plugin, but it seems that the thing I want to achieve is more difficult than I thought.

When collapsed, the dropdown should display the selected contact i.e. the selected contacts profile picture and some data next to it with a dropdown triangle next to it. In the expanded state, the dropdown should additionally display the other contacts, each with profile pic and data.

Negative 142 pI am trying to understand a point of confusion I have with JavaScript objects. Specifically, I am interested in finding what, if anything, causes an object reference to break.p  pTo demonstrate the phenomenon, I have included a copy of some output from Chromes JavaScript console. Note that I am working with arrays here, but we would expect objects to behave similarly given the subtle distinction between arrays and objects in JS. I have added comments for clarity.p  precode   Set x to some array literal gt x  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]     Set y to x gt y  x   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  gt x   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  as expected  gt y   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  as expected codepre  pAs demonstrated above, both codexcode and codeycode output the expected value. Now I shuffle the values of x using a function called codeshufflecode specified at the bottom of this question.p  precode   Shuffle x gt x  shufflex   [5, 1, 4, 2, 3]  gt x   [5, 1, 4, 2, 3]  x changes as expected  gt y   [5, 1, 4, 2, 3]  y changes as expected codepre  pAgain, everything works as expected above. The variables codexcode and codeycode have maintained reference to the same object. However, when we repeat this operation, the results are strange.p  precode   Shuffle x gt x  shufflex   [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]  gt x   [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]  x changes as expected  gt y   [5, 1, 4, 2, 3]  y didnt change this time codepre  pBelow is the shuffle function, adapted from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2450954howtorandomizeajavascriptarrayherea. Its purpose is to shuffle the contents of an array parameter coder1code and to return the first codencode items of the mixed array.p  precodefunction shuffler1,n     var i  r1.length, j, tempi, tempj, r2   r2  r1    while i      j  Math.floorMath.random  i  1     tempi  r2[i]     tempj  r2[j]     r2[i]  tempj     r2[j]  tempi       return r2.slice0,n  codepre  pI have since fixed the problem by rewriting my shuffle function based on a hrefhttpbost.ocks.orgmikeshuffle relnofollowthis functiona. However, I would still like to understand whats going on.

Negative 142 pI am new to iOS development, I have a C.NET background so please excuse my ignorance.

The test is sentpushed  to all students in the class who could be at home, in another state.  i.e. NO Bluetooth.li liStudents complete test and results are pushedsent back to teacher.  Here, I think sending the results via email would be fine.li liStudents should not have to know when to go looking for tests or have to pull some file out of an email.  In fact, they should get some notification when there is a new test ready to take, and their program should be able to pull the new test down.li ol  pMy actual idea is more complicated.  I felt this simple example gives the general idea and the challenges without giving away to much business information.p  pI suppose I could use a WebService and have the students interact with that.  The students could get an email alerting them that a test is ready to take.  I have no problem with the email alert, but Im not keen on the WebService.  It seems like an exta part that could fail webserver down, etc..  Ive researched this somewhat and come up with a couple of ideas which I would welcome feedback on.  Or perhaps there is a much simpler wayp  ol lipGame Center is designed to transfer state information from one phone to another when a game is going on.  At least thats my initial read of it.

Apparently you could run a web server on the teachers device.  I know I said I didnt want webservers or webservices involved, but I was thinking of external ones.  If the teachers device is out of commission, everything grinds to a halt anyhow.  Again, if this could be configured so that only certain devices can access the webserver those devices belonging to the 30 students, and there was a way for the webserver to announce, Hey, new test available. Come and get it, this would be a fine solution.pli ol  pCan someone give me some ideas  Even better, point me to some tutorialsbooksetc. In the case of GameCenter, a very simple example would be nice.

Negative 142 pIn VBScript, I want to get a list of files in a folder ordered by creation date. I saw that in order to do that I will need to either use a record set seems like an overkill to me or sort the collection myself I think I can avoid it and I want my code to be shorter.p  pSince I am the one creating the files, I create them with names that begin with the date yyyymmdd so I though that if I can get the files at least ordered by name then Im all set. Unfortunately, the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary18b4130628vvs.8429.aspx relnofollowMSDN documentation of the Files collection from FileSystemObjecta doesnt say anything about the order of the collection.

Negative 142 pI have a question regarding properly writing a COMATL wrapper for a 32bit DLL.p  pHeres the problem.  As some of my other questions imply, I often have to perform coding work on a large codebase, which includes libraries that are linked from a myraid of different vendors.  We have software which runs on a variety of machines, on a variety of architectures.  This code is primarily written in C, and C DLLs are linked or compiledlinked and subsequently PInvoked from the C when necessary far easier to implement, in my opinion, than managed C.p  pAnyway, one such program contains C code which must interface with several 64bit DLLs, to which the source is unavailable.  This softwares target host machines are all 64bit.  No problem.  C running in AnyCPU mode thus is automatically spawned as 64bit without WoW, and is able to seamlessly PInvoke these precompiled, 3rd party 64bit DLLs.p  pThere is one such DLL for which only a 32bit version is available to me.  There is no way of obtaining a 64bit version of this DLL.  I have 1. the 32bit DLL, a 2. header file containing function exports i.e. define EXP declspecdllexport, EXP BOOL       WINAPI  DLLFunctionIN int myInt,OUT int result, and 3. a corresponding 32bit lib file.p  pAfter extensive research, I have learned that, apparently, COMATL is the proper way in which to access a 32bit DLL from a 64bit process.  Apparently, I spawn up a 32bit COM process under WoW, and interface with it.  Sounds ok from an architectural standpoint, but I cant find any tutorials or descriptions as to how to specifically do it.  Ive tried using Visual Studio 2010s ATL wizard, but am still at a loss as to how to properly do this.  Is there an automated tool  Any templates or tutorials  I promise I have scoured the net to the best of my ability, and was just wondering 1. if Im approaching this problem in the correct manner, or 2. do you know of any resources, or 3. does anyone have some sort of generic IPC template for thisp  pFrom what Ive read on SO, it seems like image mismatches like this are a common problem for programmers, yet I havent been able to find any detailed explanations or at least pointers to detailed explanations, aside from use COMATL.  One of my previous posts generated a response wherein the questions of PInvoke signature calls were fleshed out in great detail, which was amazing  Im wondering if perhaps we can start a definitive 6432bit crossarchitecture discussion going herep  pThanksp  pKadajp  pEdit  I am already aware of a hrefhttpblog.mattmags.com20070630accessing32bitdllsfrom64bitcode relnofollowhttpblog.mattmags.com20070630accessing32bitdllsfrom64bitcodea, and understand the architecture, but am wondering about the details of implementation.p
Negative 142 pI have a form which is in a directive. It contains 2 select dropdowns jQuery styled and one jQuery UI slider, so its all consistently themed.p  pDropdown 1 is populated at spawn, as simple as they come. Dropdown 2 gets populated when the value of Dropdown 1 changes. This happens because dropdown 1 has codengchangerefreshModelscode attached to it. This works like a charm.p  pHowever, sliders are more problematic. In order to get the value of the slider, I need to have a hidden input field which gets populated with .val on every change in the slider position. The value updates correctly, and even the change event fires when I put codeonchangeconsole.logI changedcode onto the hidden field, I get everything logged nicely.p  pHowever, the ngmodel attached to that very same hidden field never updates.

Negative 142 pNew to rest and not having even known what REST was, I began watching a few videos and picked up a book to help guide me towards the correct approach. Unfortunately, my first version is completely botched to hell and Im likely going to have to break any customers using that implementation shortly. To ensure that I dont need to do this again, I need your assistancep  pI have a few DB tables that Im concerned with here PrimaryBuyer amp AllBuyers They share a majority of fields, but AllBuyers has a few things Primary does not and vice versa. Each primary buyer is given a unique CaseNumber when entered into the system. This in addition to a SequenceNumber is then used to identify AllBuyers. This CaseNumber is returned to the user of the web service to store for future use. The sequence numbers however are implied based on their location within the XML  JSON. p  pTo specify these tables  For example, if I were to buy a car I would be the primary buyer and would thusly be entered into BOTH Primary and AllBuyers tables. However, if my credit was bad I could have my spouse cosign on the loan. This would make her a secondary buyer, and she would be entered exclusively into AllBuyers table.p  pI currently have one REST URI set up as buyers which mandates that all information for all buyers is entered at once. Similarly if I were to do an update on this URI, the Primary is updated in both tables and any Secondary buyers in the payload would replace previously existing ones.  p  pstrongUltimately, there is no way to directly access tables PrimaryBuyer and AllBuyersstrongp  pIve been trying to think of a solution around this problem, but have been unable to think of anything thats necessarily RESTful or not a pain for customers. Is it ridiculous to think that the user should say on an add POST to primarybuyer, take the returned casenumber, and then POST the same information and then some to allbuyers That seems like it would be a little silly on bandwidth among other things. Should things be left in their current statep  pHopefully thats not too much information to answer such a seemingly simple question.p

I want to make sure they arent updating their own role so I need to check that the property role isnt somewhere in their mongoDB modifier json object. But it could be in a few places in a modifier so doing the if property chaining doesnt work well for this case.p  pDo I need to write my own recursive hasOwnProperty I am thinking that something like this should already exist somewhere in a project like jquery or underscores.js or sugar.js but I cant seem to find it.p

Negative 142 pThis morning Ive had a discussion with a colleague about this topic. He says that its always better to allocate arrays as arrays of pointers, since allocating every single element separately has better chances to get a free memory chunk. Somethink like thisp  precode Consider nelements as a dynamic value int nelements  10, i int ary  int  mallocsizeofint   nelements  fori  0 i lt nelements i    ary[i]  int  mallocsizeofint  codepre  pAs opposed to his approach, I think that is better to allocate arrays of elements, just because youll get a compact memory chunk and not a bunch of references spread around the heap. Something like thisp  precodeint nelements  10 int ary  int  mallocsizeofint  nelements  ary[0]  100 codepre  pAfter this conversation Ive been thinking about it, and my final conclusion is that it depends. I find the second solution a better approach when dealing with small datatypes for the reason I mentioned above, but when allocating arrays of large structs is probably better the first one.p  pApart of my conclusion, what do you think about itp

Then, on each platform, I compute the dot product and print the result, using this codep  precodeprintfa .24ft.24ft.24ft.24fn,a.x,a.y,a.z,a.w printfb .24ft.24ft.24ft.24fn,b.x,b.y,b.z,b.w float dotproduct  a.xb.x  a.yb.y  a.zb.z  a.wb.w printfa dot b .24fn,dotproduct codepre  pand the resulting printout for the CPU isp  precodea 0.999629139900207519531250   0.024383276700973510742188 0.012127066962420940399170 0.013238593004643917083740 b 0.001840781536884605884552  0.033134069293737411499023  0.988499701023101806640625  1.000000000000000000000000 a dot b 0.001397025771439075469971 codepre  pand for the CUDA kernelp  precodea 0.999629139900207519531250   0.024383276700973510742188 0.012127066962420940399170 0.013238593004643917083740 b 0.001840781536884605884552  0.033134069293737411499023  0.988499701023101806640625  1.000000000000000000000000 a dot b 0.001397024840116500854492 codepre  pAs you can see, the values for a and b seem to be bitwise equivalent on both platforms, but the result of the exact same code differs ever so slightly. It is my understanding that floating point multiplication is welldefined as per the IEEE 754 Standard and is hardwareindependent. However, I do have two hypotheses as to why I am not seeing the same resultsp  ol liThe compiler optimization is reordering the multiplications, and they happen in a different order on GPUCPU, giving rise to different results.li liThe CUDA kernel is using the fused multipladd FMA operator, as described in a hrefhttpdeveloper.download.nvidia.comassetscudafilesNVIDIACUDAFloatingPoint.pdf relnofollowhttpdeveloper.download.nvidia.comassetscudafilesNVIDIACUDAFloatingPoint.pdfa. In this case, the CUDA results should actually be a bit more accurate. li ol
Negative 142 pThe Apple docs about the cookie accept policy for NSHTTPCookieStorage are confusing.p  pThis is what the docs sayp  blockquote   pNSHTTPCookieStorage implements a singleton object shared instance that manages storage of cookies. Each cookie is represented by an instance of the NSHTTPCookie class. As a rule, cookies are shared among all applications and are kept in sync across process boundaries. Session cookies where the cookie objects isSessionOnly method returns YES are local to a single process and are not shared.p      pstrongiOS Notestrong Cookies are not shared among applications in iOS.p      pstrongNotestrong Changes made to the cookie accept policy affect all currently running applications using the cookie storage.p blockquote  pAnd the following about  voidsetCookieAcceptPolicyNSHTTPCookieAcceptPolicyaPolicyp  blockquote   pThe default cookie accept policy is NSHTTPCookieAcceptPolicyAlways. Changing the cookie policy affects all currently running applications using the cookie storage.p blockquote  pNow my first thought was if an app was to call setCookieAcceptPolicy, the change would affect other running applications. This does not appear to be the case. Calling setCookieAcceptPolicy will only affect the app which called it.p  pThe only cookie policy which applies to all running applications is the Safari one. In iOS 7 before an app calls setCookieAcceptPolicy, it uses the safari policy.  So if the safari cookie policy is set to always block, then any app wont be able to use cookies until it sets its own cookie policy. I understand this has caused issues for a lot of apps since iOS 7 came out.p  pIs my observation correct about all this, or have I missed somethingp  pstrongEditstrongp  pIve raised a bug with Apple and waiting to hear back from them now.p

Only the logic is different  if you select a row, different things happen, also the rows look a little bit different, but those differences are made in the ViewControllers code.

But in this format I get AttributeError sin.  p  pBasically I think python cant recognize func as just being a trig function which it knows how to symbolically integrate.  I could just have sympy import sin and then things would work, but then Im stuck with func referencing sin in the sympy namespace and there are future things I want to do with func which require that it be defined using sin in the numpy namespace. p

Negative 142 pI am writing an application in Java to make calls and view when people are in calls, their phone is ringing or are idle, using the library JainSip and at the moment am trying to correctly implement presence with SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY messages. I am able to get presence data to be received, but after a while the presence data stops being displayed by my program.p  pI believe this is because the overridden method processRequest is not being called. This is the earliest point in the program where NOTIFY messages are being handled and not even the print statements are being output.p  pThe bizarre thing about this is that the notify messages are being sent when I make calls, and the presence data is there. I know this because I have done Wireshark traces when running the program.p  pNote No exceptions are occurring during execution of the program, to cause erroneous behaviour.p  pIf anybody has any insight into why this is happening, I would be very grateful.p  pThanks a lot, Adamp

Negative 142 pSo ive recently decided to up my game and try to learn how to use the fabled Eclipse IDE. So far so good, I love it for many reasons, but ive encountered one simple issue.p  pI added an image to a JLabel using the codeImageIconcode format like I used to when I was learning Java using the JGRASP IDE, only the problem is, the image wont display at all in Eclipse. There is just an empty panel. When I switch over to JGRASP, despite the fact that the image is far too large for the display area, it definitely displays at least partially, unlike in Eclipse. p  pMy question is, why could this be I have the .jpg file located in the src folder of my project, so that isnt the issueI used the same folder when I loaded the project into JGRASP. Do I need to define a pathway when using Eclipse or is there something else I could be missing p  pAnyways, here is my code so far, bare bones as it is.

Negative 142 pIve got a question concerning OpenLayers and OSM maps.p  pThe general idea of the web application is to draw a route from some points. There are two casesp  ol liPoints for the route are givenli liThere are no points for the routeli ol  pWhat I want to do is to stretch the map to the div in which it is embedded in order to provide kind of responsive design. I set the dimensions of the openlayers map to fit the div completely and there are no problems with it. In the case where Ive got some points from which I draw the route I just draw the vector from them and then zoomToExtent to the drawn vector and works as I want it to work. The problem occurs when there are no points given. When I do zoomToMaxExtent it just draws a small map in the middle of the div and the rest remains empty. What I want to obtain is to fill the whole div with the map. There is no problem for me if I will need to set some center point, but I do want to show as much map as it is only possible for current resolution  window size. Do you know any ways to deal with itp  pThanksp

All I am trying to do is to eliminate the calls for codecontext.Items[key]code. Accessing this dictionary using magic strings are pretty error prone. so I am thinking about creating something like codecontext.GetIceCreamcode codecontext.GetBeercode instead of calling context.Items[icecream] context.Items[beer], also I would like this calls to be strongly typed, for example GetIceCream will return an object of class IceCream. So my code will be codevar iceCream  context.GetIceCreamcode instead of var codeiceCream  IceCreamcontext.items[icecream]code    I am trying to utilize the functional approach with traditional OO concept.

Regarding to this a hrefhttpsgithub.comblog1547releaseyoursoftware relnofollowposta your are able to attach archives to an releasetag of an GitHub repository.

Negative 142 pUsing Leaflet 0.7.3 and last version of markercluster a hrefhttpsgithub.comLeafletLeaflet.markercluster relnofollowhttpsgithub.comLeafletLeaflet.markerclustera, I would like to reproduce a behavior I have been able to do using Google API and associated libraries Google Marker Cluster V3 amp Overlapping Marker Spiderfier V3.p  pWhen you have a map with your clusters and you click on one cluster, the API will zoom to bound the markers contained in this cluster. But when all your markers are exactly on the same position, the zoom will be set to its maximum value which is often ugly no context around the markers or just one street. I would like to limit the zoom level when user click on one cluster with a code like this p  precode        markers.onclusterclick, function a              map.fitBoundsa.layer.getBounds             if map.getZoom gt 14                  map.setZoom14                       codepre  pWith such code the zoom is correctly limited to 14 but the spiderfy is not done even if I explicitly call a.layer.spiderfy. Is there something I am missing p  pHere is the fiddle  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net953u41ax relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net953u41axa click for exemple on 36 then on 12p
Negative 142 pIn many iOS apps that have WebViews, using JavaScripts codewindow.opencode method will load the attempted popup window in the main window instead, losing everything that was in memory in the opening page. Is there a way to detect that codewindow.opencode will do this instead of its intended functionality of opening a separate pagep

Negative 142 pI am struggeling around a long time with this and I suspect other users do as well.p  pFirst I have to say that I have no alternative to FPDF because I use a lot of other FPDF modules, so please try not to recommend to use another library Like TCPDF.p  pI really need to make FPDF to be able to handle UTF8 characters in a stable way. p  pstrongWhat I already found outstrongp  pThere is an extension called UFPDF  a hrefhttpacko.netblogufpdfunicodeutf8extensionforfpdf relnofollowhttpacko.netblogufpdfunicodeutf8extensionforfpdfap  pThe extension supports TrueType fonts only for now but it should work for me. The .ttf file has to be converted by a tool called ttf2ufm and the resulting .ufm and the source .ttf are convertet to font.php, font.z and font.ctg.z file by using the given tool makefontuni.php.p  pSo far so good. So I tried to convert the Arial font from my computer. arial.ttf, arialbd.ttf, arialbi.ttf, ariali.ttfp  pIt worked and I was able to produce a test.pdf with unicode characters. But the was a error popup shown by AdobeReader which says something like Bad Parameter  the font ArialMT contains bad Widths.p  pI noticed that all characters had the same width i suspect the default widths so I tried to debug.p  pI found out that UPDF adds the widths to the PDF like thisp  precodecharnumber [width] charnumber [width]  85 [276] for the u character codepre  pAnd I found out that some characters had a negative index valuep  precode70 [266] codepre  pThe index values are created by ttf2ufm. If i look at the resulting arial.ufm i found entries like thisp  precodeU 70  WX 450  N uni06BE  G 1003  B 70 256 788 1136  codepre  pI suspected that U is the index in utf8 table and I modified the makefontuni.php to make it to ignore negative values for U. Created the font.php, font.z and font.ctg.z again and it worked. The ErrorNotice was not shown and the characters was shown up with the correct width.p  pstrongSo the first question isstrong  Why does ttf2ufm produce negative values for U Is this correct And if it is correct why is the AdobeReader not able to handle itp  pI hoped that was all but it is not.p  pI did some more tests by using the BOLD font and the lower u character was shown as a strange sign when using arial bold.p  pI debugged again and I found this line for the u character in arialbd.ufmp  precodeU 117  WX 611  N u  G 88  B 141 24 1107 1062  codepre  pI searched for U 117 in that file and I found another character beginning with U 117 . I already removed it so I cannot post the line here. However this was the wrong char shown in pdf and after removing it the u had been displayed correctly.p  pstrongSo the second question isstrong What is the reason why ttf2ufm produces a .ufm file with 2 characters with the same index This happens only for arialbd.ttf not for arial.ttf.p  pHowever i solved it for now hoping there are no other doubleindexcharacters.p  pMore issuesp  pI recognized that the resulting arial.php contains the character widthsp  precodecwarray     32gt278, 160gt278, 33gt278, 34gt355, 35gt556, 36gt556,      37gt889, 38gt667, 39gt191, 40gt333, 41gt333, 42gt389, 43gt584,      44gt278, 45gt333, 173gt333, [...] codepre  pThe arial.php in nonunicode version contains the codecwcode array, too. But it uses the character itself as index, not the index numberp  precodecwarray       chr0gt750,chr1gt750,chr2gt750,chr3gt750,chr4gt750,     chr5gt750,chr6gt750,chr7gt750,chr8gt750,chr9gt750,chr10gt750,     chr11gt750,chr12gt750, [...] codepre  pAnd fpdf.php sometimes tries to access the codecwcode value and some other modules do it, too to be able to compute the width of given string. All of this failed for UFPDF.p  pI tried to fix it by modify fpdf.php and all modules that try to access codecwcode like thisp  pI created a method called codecharlengthcode in fpdf classp  precodefunction charlengthchar       cw  ampthisgtCurrentFont[cw]     return cw[char]  codepre  pAnd made FPDF to call codecharlengthcode whenever it wants to access codethisgtCurrentFont[cw]codep  precodefunction GetStringWidths       Get width of a string in the current font     s  strings      cw  ampthisgtCurrentFont[cw]  Old FPDFCode     w  0     l  strlens     fori0iltli           w  cw[s[i]]  Old FPDFCode         w  thisgtcharlengths[i]  My replacement          return wthisgtFontSize1000  codepre  pIn ufpdf.php i override the method codecharlengthcode like thisp  precodefunction charlengthchar          cw  ampthisgtCurrentFont[cw]     utf8dec  thisgtordutf8char, offset             ifissetcw[utf8dec]          return 0          return cw[utf8dec]    function ordutf8string, ampoffset      string  classstringToolsutf8decodestring     code  ordsubstrstring, offset,1     if code gt 128         otherwise 0xxxxxxx         if code lt 224 bytesnumber  2                110xxxxx         else if code lt 240 bytesnumber  3        1110xxxx         else if code lt 248 bytesnumber  4    11110xxx         else return 1         codetemp  code  192  bytesnumber gt 2  32  0  bytesnumber gt 3  16  0         for i  2 i lt bytesnumber i              offset              code2  ordsubstrstring, offset, 1  128        10xxxxxx             codetemp  codetemp64  code2                  code  codetemp          offset  1     if offset gt strlenstring offset  1     return code  codepre  pThe codeordutf8code method is from php.net but i had to modify it because i got strage values for codecodecode one time the value of codecodecode was 252 which results in an undefined codebytenumbercode. p  pHowever it seems to work for now but I am not very happy with editing the source of fpdf.php and the source of other modules.

What do you think about the last modifications Do you have some improvements I really need a stable way to make FPDF to support unicode characters. Please help me.p  pIt is a shame that the author of ufpdf has no time to support this.p

Negative 142 pIm using javascript to control where my page page scrolls to after clicking on an anchor link, as I have a fixed nav. p  pI have one page that the anchors  script work correctly on PAGE B. My issue is that I have buttons on a different page PAGE A that need to go the anchors on the correctly working page PAGE B. The anchor itself works correctly, but the javascript does not fire. p  pThe reason why its not firing tested by putting an alert and not receiving a popup is because the javascript for the buttons on PAGE A does not know to look for the element on PAGE B.

Negative 142 pWe have an issue where we have a website for test and an equivalent website for live. What we are finding is that due to carelessness our testers are using the wrong site e.g. testing on the live site.p  pWe have total control over both sites, but since the test site is for acceptance testing by the users we dont want to make them different in any way. The sites must look the same and there is also a layer of management that will kick up a storm if the test and live sites are in any way different.p  pHow have other people solved this problem I am thinking of a browser plugin to make the browser look different somehow e.g. changing the colour of the location bar when on the test website. Does anyone know of a plugin or a technique that would work We primarily use Firefox and Chromep  pThanks,p  pPhilp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pWe eventually settled on a program of different credentials for the test and live site this was not popular and making a series of plugins available for those who wanted them colourize tabs for Chrome and Firefox users  we never did find a good plugin for IE. p  pThanks to those who answered.p
Negative 142 pThis is probably and extremely easy question for some of you, although I require assistance in understanding the process of setting up a database connection between my Spring MVC application, which is currently running on Glassfish 4 and MySQL. What are the steps in doing this I have outlined my ideas below, however I am still left unclear with this process.p  pSo far I have created a JDBC Connection Pool within the Glassfish 4 administration panel and connected successfully with the defined parameters ping returns successful. Do I need to create a JNDI DataSource now, because I believe this is required to connect to the Database Connection Poolp  pIf this is the correct steps thus far What steps are performed next My assumption is that the web.xml needs to be configured so that it links to the JNDI DataSource Is this correctp  pYour assistance in this manner will be appreciated.p  pstrong[UPDATED]strongp  pI have figured this all out and now everything is performing as expected. However, I ran into one implication along the way which I did not quite understand why the connection did not want to function at one point.p  pThis was my configuration within the web.xml where I faced issues withp  pcodeltresourcerefgt         ltresrefnamegtjdbcapplicationltresrefnamegt         ltrestypegtjavax.sql.DataSourceltrestypegt         ltresauthgtContainerltresauthgt ltresourcerefgtcodep  pI was receiving all types of errors when attempting to pull records from one of my tables.

What I get is dynamic I could get a Mac truck one time and a Toyota the next or a mixture of the two. And the size of the XML I get could be small or large. So its hard to just use XPath or directly go after specific elements as I dont know what Ill get. This is why Im basically walkingtraversing the DOM a node at a time to extract out just what is useable.p  pSo my question is What am I doing wrong in my parsingwriting of the XML file to not get it to look like what Im trying to get it to look likep

Hence put method calls overrided equals correctly depending upon the no. of objects in bucket as seen in output for Line 1,4,5,6. But for get method it is not the same.

Line 7 didnt WHYp  p3 equalsObject o method compares the passed object i.e Object o with all Objects resides in bucket with given hashcode. Then why did it doesnt stop comapring when it found one early.

Negative 142 pI did not find any adequate answers to my question on Internet. So, I am asking here. Here is my situation I am building an Android application where Android clients need to communicate with each other by passing through a Javasql server on the same port. I created the client and server sides but i am wondering what components i should take in count in order to have a server able to handle several thousand of clients  Lets say for instance 2000 clients. Is a high bandwidth for the server enough to achieve my goal  number of connections  bandwidth of server  average bandwidth of client. Or a combination between the bandwidth of clients and server, CPU and RAM is necessary p  pI would appreciate any help.p  pBest regards,p
Negative 142 pIm developing an App where a farmer drops custom annotations  pins with numbers  at points of interest in his crop, emails a report with screenshot back to his office, and moves on to his next paddock. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgRJ3u.png altpart screenshot of field of pinsp  pPart of the code that sends the email include resetting properties and zeroing arrays and ivars etc. His first field works fine, but the numbering of the POI in all the fields that follow go haywire. The data represented by the errant pins are correct, just the pins themselves are not more on that in a moment . p  pSo Ive established that there is nothing wrong with anything leading up to a pin drop and Ive cleared my annotations withp  precode[ self.mapView removeAnnotationsself.mapView.annotations] codepre  pThe Apple docs mention that one also needs to implement this method in the reset p  precode[ self.mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifiermyAnnotation]  codepre  pbecause even though theyve been cleared from the screen they are still present in memory.  However that still does not fix my quandry. If I explicitly wipe my annotations out of existence withp  precodeself.mapView.annotations  nil codepre  pthe problem still remains. Numbers on the annotation appear random in the 2nd and 3rd .. field.  By logging to an onscreen textView I can see the array holding the correct values of the POI number. Something about CLLocation or MKAnnotation is still persisting somewhere. Nothing is in the Class Reference at Apple about how to reset CLLocationManager, so I presume it is done with a simple Start and Stop. My use of those are correctly balanced, so Im not running multiple instances. p  p Heres the snippet that decides what pin to drop, the action happens in the middle where commentedp  precode MKAnnotationView mapViewMKMapView mapView viewForAnnotationidltMKAnnotationgtannotation  if[annotation isKindOfClass[MKUserLocation class]]     return nil      static NSString identifier  myAnnotation MKAnnotationView  annotationView  MKAnnotationView[self.mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifieridentifier]  if annotationView      annotationView  [[MKAnnotationView alloc] initWithAnnotationannotation reuseIdentifieridentifier]                standard stuff up to here              findings build up as a score of each test point.      if contentScore  0                   a green asterisk marker if no score was achieved      annotationView.image  [UIImage imageNamedmarkerZero.png]          else                the marker number comes from idx in SiteCount Array      str  [NSString stringWithFormatmarkerd.png,siteCount[idx]       annotationView.image  [UIImage imageNamedstr]         else    annotationView.annotation  annotation   return annotationView  codepre  pCurrently the workaround is the fiddly job of taking it out of memory on the home screen and relaunching before beginning the next field.

While using this object in method, is there difference if I usep  precodetest  test.next codepre  por if I usep  precodeExample test2  test test2  test2.next codepre  pI suppose those two mean the same, are references on same object so iterating one also means iterating the second.

Assuming what I wrote before is correct I cant just write codetest  test.nextcode because everything I do will get dispelled once I exit method.p  pHow should I approach this problem if I want to delete one of the elements in my list One thing more I cant use LinkedLists or anything else, this is how I am supposed to do my assignment.p
Negative 142 pI am stuck on a database problem for a client, wandering if someone could help me out. I am currently trying to implement filtering functionality so that a user can filter results after they have searched for something. We are using SQL Server 2008. I am working on an electronics ecommerce site and the database is quite large 500,000 plus records. The scenario is this  user goes to our website and types in laptop and clicks search. This brings up the first page of several thousand results. What I want to do is then filter these results further and present the user with options such asp  h2Filter By Manufacturerh2  pDell 10,000br Acer 2,000br Lenovo 6,000p  h2Filter By Colourh2  pBlack 7000br Silver 2000p  pThe main columns of the database are like this  the primary key is an integer IDp  pbID    Title  Manufacturer    Colourbp  pThe key part of the question is how to get the counts in various categories in an efficient manner. The only way I currently know how to do it is with separate queries. However, should we wish to filter by further categories then this will become very slow  especially as the database grows. My current SQL is thisp  precodeselect count as ManufacturerCount, Manufacturer from [ProductDB.Product] GROUP BY Manufacturer select count as ColourCount, Colour from [ProductDB.Product] GROUP BY Colour codepre  pMy question is if I can get the results as a single table using somekind of join or union and if this would be faster than my current method of issuing multiple queries with the Count function. Thanks for your help, if you require any further information please ask. PS I am wandering how on sites like ebay and amazon manage to do this so fast. In order to understand my problem better if you go onto ebay and type in laptop you will see a number of filters on the left  this is basically what I am trying to achieve. I dont know how it can be done efficiently when there are many filters. E.g to get functionality equivalent to Ebay I would need about 10 queries and Im sure that will be slow. I was thinking of creating an intermediate table with all the counts however the intermediate table would have to be continuously updated in order to reflect changes to the database and that would be a problem if there are multiple updates per minute. Thanks.p

Negative 142 pHeres my scenariop  pI have a layout template that needs to check to see if a User belongs to at least one Team.  If not, then display a div across the entire site.  A user can only see the teams they belong to, so I created a simple publication that works  code samples are CoffeeScriptp  precodeMeteor.publish teams, gt   return null if userId   Teams.find members.id userId codepre  pThis works great and Teams.find.fetch in console gives expected results.p  pHowever, if I put this code in, say, the Template.layout.rendered, it doesnt work.p  precodeTemplate.layout.rendered  gt   teams  Teams.find.fetch   hasTeams  teams.length gt 0   if hasTeams     ...do stuff.. codepre  pObviously this doesnt work because the Teams find is async and not loaded when it needs to make the decision.  With a normal template  page I would just use the IronRouter waitOn but what do I do on the layoutp  pI could do a waitOn in my router, but since the data is global and going to be used everywhere, and because a user could deep link into the site all over the place, I dont want to add that waitOn to EVERY single route.p  pSo what is the proper pattern  How do I get the meteor client to load global data and wait for the data before running the routep
Negative 142 pFor project euler i was looking for a way to implement the sieve of Eratosthenes because i expected it to be faster than my original implementation and needed it to be so. I came up with this functionp  precodesieve  Int gt [Int] gt [Int] sieve p xxs  rem x p  0  sieve p xs                 otherwise  x  sieve x  sieve p xs sieve  []  [] codepre  pWhich works, but hits the fan very fast, resulting in a stack overflow. I headed here for some advice and immediately struck a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1764163helpexplainthischunkofhaskellcodethatoutputsastreamofprimesspoilera which, to me, looks quite the same, but the difference in performance is outlandish.  I still want to continue using my own implementation, and would like to know whether or not my function can be changed easily to use less memory.p

However I was wondering if it was possible to get the category of each of these items.For example in the Maps application there is different icons displayed for shops, hotels, train stations and so on. Also if you view a place mark.You get a category label such as Grocery. As a developer can I access that information for a Map Item If so I would like to know how.p  pThank Youp
Negative 142 pWe are using TFS2010 to do our builds.  The screenshot below depicts a typical build report from a successful build. The build is a manual build, kicked off by a user at the a desired time and does not have a specific changeset specified on the build definition.p  pThe top line of the build report states that the build was triggered for a particular changeset number 35264, however that changeset number is a changeset which has nothing to do with the associated changesets that were used to generate the build. The changeset number provided at the top of the build report is higher than any of the associated changesets and for a source path which is not referenced in the build definition.  The codeBuild Explorercode also lists this changeset number in a column labeled Source Version.p  pI would expect the number at the top of the build report to be changeset 35262, which is the associated changeset with the build. Why would TFS report an arbitrary changeset number when I queue a build Is this number being reported the current max changeset number in the Team Project Collection at the time of the buildp  pI am having a difficulty understanding what this changeset number is and what it represents and looking for someone to help clarify this number.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSlfKd.jpg altbuild report screenshotp

Negative 142 pThrough the use of many articles and Stack Overflow questions, I was finally able to successfully bind a Java Socket to a port port 8000 on an Openshift website. p  pI know the binding was successful because no exceptions were thrown, and I was able to poll the Socket for its port number. I can also successfully connect to the socket from a client application I have, after using the rhc client tools to forward the ports.p  pThe problem is, how do I connect to the server socket without port forwarding Im not able to connect to the server from any other computers, or from my own computer without port forwarding.p  pThese are the things that I have tried so farp  ul liConnecting to localhost at port 8000, which works after port forwarding.li liConnecting to the website URL at port 8000, which always returns null.li liConnecting to the website IP at port 8000, which results in a Connection refused connect error.li ul  pClient code p  precode    InetAddress ip  InetAddress.getByNamelocalhost          Also tried 127.5.8.129 which openshift says is the website IP, and the website URL itself.

Also we are using the Parse localdatastore instead of native DBi.e.,for iOS Core data and for android SqlLite. Intially we have to sync the huge amount of data from Parse.

Negative 142 pAfter an Eclipse performance issue in Windows, I decided to move to a Debian O.S. in order to continue development of a project of mine.p  pWhen I did that, I noticed that just some table names were not being found in MySQL when Hibernate was doing datamodel checks during initialization, due to casesensitive issues. Two of the tables are still being searched by Tablename instead of tablename. When it occours, Hibernate create new tables Tablename ignoring existent tablename ones. I read that it is due to a MySQL feature in casesensitive O.S.p  pIve added codeTablenametablenamecode statement in every model class, in order to avoid capitalization of table names by MySQLHibernate, and I reviewed all HQL queries in DAO Classes putting all table references to lower case, but Ive not achieved success in either attempts.p  pWhat configuration am I missing in order to fix this behavior Thanks.p

Negative 142 pMy model has a list property and in the view i need to be able to add an unlimited number of strings to it.  So far its not working and my lousy idea to make it work is the following Each time a string is added, theres a postback. The new string is in the ViewModels newString property not a list. The HttpPost method will then save newString to the database, refill the list allStrings with all strings stored in the database and return the view with all strings and an emtpy textbox to add another string.p  pThis is not a good solution for me becausep  ul liTheres a lot of postbacks if the user wants to add multiple stringsli liIf the user adds some strings to his item a supplier, all these strings are saved to the database. When he then decides he doesnt want to save the supplier all the stored strings are useless and need to be deleted from the database.li ul  pI have not implemented this because I know theres far better solutions and I just dont find them.

Say x, y and z are always the same size, say 1000, and out is always smaller, say 100. z is the indices in out that each of x and y correspond to.p  pThis is all find except the updates to out. There may be clashes across threads as z does not contain only unique values and has duplicates. Therefore I currently have this implemented with atomic versions of  a hrefhttpdocs.nvidia.comcudacudacprogrammingguideindex.htmlatomicfunctions relnofollowatomicAdda and subtract using compare and swap. This is obviously expensive and means my kernel takes 510x longer to run.p  pI would like to reduce this however the only way I can think of doing this is for each thread to have its own version of out which can be large, 10000, X 10000 threads. This would mean I set up 10000 double[10000] perhaps in shared call my kernel, and then sum across these arrays, perhaps in another kernel. Surely there must be a more elegant way to do thisp  pIt might be worth noting that x, y, z and out reside in global memory. As my kernel I have others like this is very simple I have not decided to copy across bits to shared nvvp on the kernel shows equal computation and memory so I am thinking not much performance to be gained when adding overhead of moving data from global to shared and back again, any thoughts.p

Negative 142 pWeve been using VisualSVN standard edition for a few years without any problems. We have a C application which stores data in SVN. It uses SharpSvn a hrefhttpssharpsvn.open.collab.net relnofollowhttpssharpsvn.open.collab.neta library for SVN access. Occasionally, the application executes a serverside SVN COPY command SharpSvns RemoteCopy to create a branch based on a series of existing in the repository files.p  pWe recently updated VisualSVN from version 2.5.2 to 3.2.2 and also purchased a license to unlock enterprise features of the product.

Negative 142 pI have some questions regarding my portfolio site and icons that utlize a hover animation in the toolbar. The issue is specifically the icons in the top right corner which function as the sites navigation. The url is www.donovanparisi.com, and it is working perfectly across all browsers except IE. And at that, it is working fine up to full screen mode which makes me think it is related to media queries but there are no such issues across any other browsers. I have been pouring over the code for weeks and am unable to determine why this behavior only happens at such a specific screen size in one browser.

However, the URL is not defined, so they generate 404 Not Found errors.

For that cause I read numerous tutorials on C and object oriented programing but I feel I lack some basic knowledege.p  pI have created several forms, lets call them form1 to form3.

I have EventHandlers that accept the data and convert it to numbers in double variables. p  pstrongMy problem is how to pass the variables to the main form or assign them to variables already defined in form1, in order to make some calcultation with them.strong I understand that each form is an object of class Form and I cant simply access the variables defined in form1 from other forms. But assume there must be way..p  pI have searched a solution for this problem here and hadnt find it yet. I know it is probably a task fairly easy to achieve and maybe I have already enountered a solution but I didnt know how to implement it corretcly. I have searched for days a  proper tutorial on  Windows Forms Application or on CCLI language but didnt found a comprehensive one.p  pI will greatly appreciate any answer that can help, I am stuck on this matter for nearly 2 weeks.p

Negative 142 pQualifying information we use Crystal Reports 8.5 and our current application is written in VB6. Our original database was SQL Server 2005 and currently we run on SQL Server 2012, however are set to the 2005 compatibility level level 90. We created a new database in SQL Server 2014 and have hooked the application up to the new server successfully, however now the Crystal Reports do not render properly data showing up in places it should not, formulas not getting interpreted properly.p  pI have verified all data being returned is in the same format, collated the same, checked the schema for any changes, I have uninstalled and reinstalled Crystal Reports dependencies. When I run connected to the old databases it works fine, when I change my connection string to the new databases it does not work properly. I have looked on the Crystal Reports Forums and help documents and have found no reason for this to happen.p  pstrongQuestionstrong does anyone know, or has anyone encountered this issue with upgrading SQL Server versions Any possible explanations on how to fix it, without rewriting the application to use a newer Crystal Reports version our VB6 legacy application is irreplaceablep

Negative 142 pI have a simple layout of a Pivot containing two PivotItems, the first of which has a TextBox. Ive set the margin of the first pivot item to zero because I want the contents to cover the whole width of the screen. The problem is that when the text box receives the focus, the pivot item and its contents jumps to the right by abount 10 pixels, which isnt a great experience.p  pIve tried calling UpdateLayout in the text boxs GotFocus event, but it had no effect. Placing the text box in a Grid and setting a negative margin to that instead of the pivot item also didnt do anything.p  pAny thoughts as to how to fix this annoying visual hiccup Thanks.p

Negative 142 pThere seems to be a problem with jquery ui sortable plugin on a scrolled webpage. Im using it to reorder table rows and to move them from one table to another. When the website is scrolled, the dragampdrop from the bottom table to the top table doesnt behave correctly IMHO. The dragged elements placeholder is not inserted to the new table at the very bottom position, but rather few rows after it. Sometimes its 2, sometimes even 3 rows above. Until the mouse cursor goes up, its broken. As soon as mouse goes at least 1 pixel down, it gets repositioned and fixed.p  pThis is screenshot how it works when page is not scrolled on the left, and later the very same page when its scrolled a bit rightp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comRnXp8.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRnXp8.png altenter image description hereap  pCode is straightforwardp  precode   .sortable tbody .sortableaxis y, cursor move, tolerance pointer, cursorAt  top 20, left 20 , scroll false,         connectWith .sortable tbody,         items  trnot.nosort          body.scrollTop340 codepre  h1a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netkqobjatv1 relnofollowjsfiddleah1  pstrongHow can I fix thisstrong The goal is to ensure that it behaves the same like if the webpage is not scrolled.p  pI was playing with it whole day, tried all possible parameters of jquery ui, even tried to digg into the source code, but I wasnt successful. p
Negative 142 pI am working on a research project and what I need to do is to modify the programs or write new scripts and generate data. I would like to save all versions of programs and data so that I could easily compare different versions of programdata pairs at the same time.p  pThere are some methods I used previouslyp  ol lipmanage all the stuff by hand every time before I modify a program, I copy the unmodified version and the associated data into a folder, and then modify and run new programs. This works, but not convenient, and sometimes I forgot to do this copyandpaste step and lost some versions.pli lipGit this would be good for version control, but not easy for direct comparison of different versions of programs and data since Git does not save all versions at the same time e.g. it would be hard to compare version 1,3,7,14 of programs and data. pli ol  pI am wondering are there any other ways to save and manage all versions of programs and their associated data By the way, I spend half of my time working on Windows and the other half on Linux.p  pThanks in advancep

I create a firebase reference with a limit.p  precoderef  new FirebaseFIREBASEURL.childchat.limitToFirst50 codepre  pThis reference is then used by an Adapter which adds a listener. And then modifies a List whenever data changes.p  precoderef.addChildEventListenernew ChildEventListener      Override     public void onChildAddedDataSnapshot dataSnapshot, String previousChildName ...     Override     public void onChildChangedDataSnapshot dataSnapshot, String s ...     Override     public void onChildRemovedDataSnapshot dataSnapshot ...     ... codepre  pThe second part is where I struggle to find the right approach. When the user arrives at the end of the list, I want to load older messages and add them to the list of messages infinite scroll.p  pThe preferred solution would be to simply call something like coderef.changeLimitToFirst100code but such a method does not exist.p  pWhat would be the best approach to solve this with firebasep  hr  pstrongEditstrong p  pI deleted the solutions initially suggested by me because they did not help clarifying the problem. Instead, I will list new solutions below which I found since I originally asked the question. p  pstrongIf you know of a better, more elegant approach, please leave an answerstrongp  ol liThe easiest approach seems to be to remove the listener from the old Query Then create a new Query with a new limit. An example for this approach can be found in a hrefhttpsgithub.comfirebaseFirebaseUIAndroidpull7 relnofollowthis pull requesta for the FirebaseUIAndroid lib. Downsides are  ul liAfter adding the new listener you will receive childadded event for each child, not only for the ones you are trying to load. Therefore you have to check if a child already exists in the ArrayList before adding it. This means there will be a lot of iterations if your list gets longer.li liYou dont know when loading is completed. A workaround for this is to add an additional value listener, which will be fired once the complete snapshot has been loaded and thus loading of the new page is completed.li ulli liThe second approach would be to load each page separately by listening to the value event. Unfortunately, something like offset does not exist. So the way to go is to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27691254firebasequerywithlimitoffsetpossiblesolutionsremember the last item you loaded and pass it to the startAt methoda. Downsides  ul liIn order to receive updates youd need to remove the old child listener and add a new one because the limit changes each time youll load a new page. This listener will then receive childadded events which you have to filter out see above.li liThe position of the last item might change between the time when you load the first page and the time you load and add the second page. If the order of your data might change, you can not be sure that child you saved still is the correct reference for your next Query. In this case you need, again, a child listener to receive updates on the data you previously loaded.li ulli ol
Negative 142 pI render a search mask from a model. One possible search mask input type is a 1 from n selection. This 1 from n type contains a codepinputTextcode to show the selected value, a codepcommandButtoncode which opens a codepoverlayPanelcode to select a value and another codepcommandButtoncode to clear the selected value. In one situation the update of the clear button is not done. The ajax response does not contain the input field to update. E. g. I have 3 of this 1 from n fields in the search mask. Choose a value for each works, clear each also works. When I assign for all a value and submit the form executing the search all is fine. Now I press on the clear button of 1 from n field no. 1 and value is cleared...fine. This also works for the 2nd field, but not for the last. How mentioned the update in the ajax response is missing, but the bean method is executed. Any idea Or how can I debug it Code for the elements for a 1 from n fieldp  precodeltuiparam namecurFieldSize valuecc.attrs.curMaskElement.getSize gt ltuiparam namecurDummyCssClass valuesearchFieldChoiceDummyCssClasscc.attrs.curRowIndexcc.attrs.curColumnIndex gt  ltpinputText valuecc.attrs.curMaskElement.propertyValue readonlytrue styleClasscurDummyCssClass sizecurFieldSize     renderedcurIsChoice and curFieldSize gt 0gt     ltfconverter converterIdchoiceConverterSearchMask gt ltpinputTextgt ltpinputText valuecc.attrs.curMaskElement.propertyValue readonlytrue styleClasscurDummyCssClass     renderedcurIsChoice and curFieldSize le 0gt     ltfconverter converterIdchoiceConverterSearchMask gt ltpinputTextgt ltpcommandButton idcolChoiceSelectionButtonId oncompletePFchoiceSelectionSearchVar.loadContentscomponent.clientId     immediatetrue actionListenersearchChoiceListController.setSelectedObjectcc.attrs.curMaskElement     processthis gt ltpcommandButton immediatetrue actionListenersearchMaskBL.clearChoiceSelectioncc.attrs.curMaskElement      update.curDummyCssClass processthis .curDummyCssClass gt codepre  pThere are 2 codepinputTextcode because the model can define a variable size of a field or a fixed size.

Negative 142 pIm using CKAN 2.2.1 with the DataStore and DataPusher plugins. Almost all of our data is updated via an import script which checks an FTP directory periodically and matches files against resources in CKAN.p  pWe update the files each time a new one is found by matching on resource ID. These are then automatically added to the DataStore by the DataPusher plugin after the codeupdateresourcecode API request has been sent.p  pIm logging cURL request used to send these codeupdateresourcecode request to confirm we are sending requests exactly as expected and everything looks fine.p  pWhat seems to be happening when we are updating a resource in a dataset with multiple resources is that DataPusher adds a job to update the resource weve just updated, but then 23 seconds later adds another job for a random resource within the dataset. This is often another resource we are about to update, or even the resource we just updated. p  pThis results in overlapping jobs of the same resource being updated in the datastore and causes errors, since the same tables are being updated at the same time.p  pIve confirmed we are not mistakenly sending multiple update request via my cURL logs, however if I was to make three codeupdateresourcecode requests, DataPusher will update 5 or 6 resources immediately after. This is always the resource we expect, followed by another random resource.p  pI can see in the datapusher access logs it has been triggered more than three timesp  pIn this particular instance I updated three resources, footfalldaily, footfallhourly and footfall weekly.
