Positive 97 pMy team has had the Django migration files in .gitignore , and so hasnt been committing these files. Instead weve been making migrations on our production server. We discovered that this is not the recommended practice upon encountering a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28035119ignoringmigrationfilesingitinadjangoprojectIgnoring migration files in git in a Django Projecta . Would it cause problems to  at this point in time  remove migrations from .gitignore, makemigrations on the development machine, commit, push, and apply the migrations on the production server If so, how can we get around these problems p  pThis question is motivated largely because we need to apply a custom migration that we partially wrote ourselves. As such theres actually an additional step between making migrations on the development machine and committing them, namely adding in our custom code to the migration file.p

Positive 97 pIve read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12186379coredataschemaevolutionwithsimperiumin another answera that Simperium should be able to handle Core Data lightweight migrations fine. However, Im currently struggling with the simple case of adding an optional property to an existing entity.p  pTo make the issue a bit easier to follow, lets go through an example. Lets say that my previous app version is 1.0 and a new version 1.1 introduces a new property codefoocode on a Core Data entity.p  pNow, lets consider this scenariop  ol liDevice A and B both run version 1.0 and are attached to the same Simperium sync account, both uptodate.li liDevice A upgrades to version 1.1, the property is created in the data base, and the user adds some data to the new codefoocode property. This data is correctly synced to the Simperium backend and codefoocode is visible in the web data browser.li liDevice B still on version 1.0, i.e. without codefoocode syncs with Simperium. At this point I see codeSimperium warning applyDiff for a member that doesnt existcode, which is understandable because codefoocode does not exist. Everything still expected and fine here.li liNow device B upgrades to 1.1. When starting the app for the first time, Core Data creates the new codefoocode column. However, now that the codefoocode property is there, Simperium still does not pull its data from the backend, so devices A and B dont see the same data for codefoocodeli ol  pI understand why this happens Simperium has discarded the change the first time, because the property wasnt there yet, and then doesnt apply the same change again later when it could. However, I think this is quite problematic and effectively makes even the simplest changes to the data model very risky. Am I missing anything here What would be a safe way to add a new property to an entityp
Positive 97 pRecently we migrated a clients CS install to a new instance and have run into way too many issues. Among handfuls of unreliabilities, tedious errors, hiccups, slow support replies, etc, there are no admin users listed, and there is no way to enabledisable addons. This happened seemingly out of nowhere on both the new install and the old install sitting behind a dev domain.p  pFirst of all, the way CS splits admins compared to users which is hidden in store is very strange. I found the users buried in store settings, but Im not listed there nor in admins. Why would CS not display the admin users I am still able to edit them by manually putting their ID within the edit url, but nothing listed in the GUI. Also, why would I strongall of the suddenstrong not be able to enabledisable addons across both installs There is a 3rd party theme the client bought and the addon mess is causing the theme license mod not to work resulting in white page for their store. We already contacted both CS support and their theme dev support to swap domain names. There are no errors in logs. The return from CS license servers has ACTIVATED in the xml.p  pOverall, Im extremely disappointed in the overly complex, unreliable, and error prone CS migrate process and arbitrary remote theme licensing schema. A 20 minute job is now on day 3, slowed by lack of support agility. Any help is appreciated.p

Positive 97 pIs there an easy way to identify all the API calls an Android app makes that need to be adapted to use runtime permissions in Android M 6, API 23p  pIt appears that you just have to figure it out by testing, trial amp error, or expert knowledge eg pouring over the API docs and your source code.  I expected that Google would release a migration tool, but I havent seen any evidence of that.  emNotem doing so looks as though it will leave your apps vulnerable to runtime crashes if anyone disables access to a permission postinstall, even if you arent using the runtime permission tags in your manifest.p  pWhat are the best practices for migrating to runtime permissionsp
Positive 97 pWe use a clone of Amazon S3 called GreenQloud Storage. But they are shutting down so we have to take all the files here and migrate them in S3.p  pOur app is a little similar to a CMS in that our DB has fields that contains HTML fragments.

There were models for Users and Microposts and I have added a Cars model, where each user can have a car referenced by the carid.p  pIn the console I can create a user and a micropost, and assign the user to the micropost by stating post.user  michael and then it would set the posts userid to michaels id. I am trying to do the same for cars, where i can set a users carid by stating michael.car  somecar but it gives an error even though the model associations LOOK exactly the same, and I have even remigrated the carid to the user model as reference.

Positive 97 pWhat is the right way to use the functions in migration, up and downp  pI required some new column names to be settled. So I had destroyed the old controller  and generated a new one, and a new model with some columns.p  pLater on I had replaced change function name with down, rake, it all goes normal.p  pBut Im still confused that why a down works.p  pI assume the situation is because there were some column names conflicting, so migration task couldnt happen. Rails thinks migration was not rake, thats why it gave me pending migration error, and it loops. And down function in migration will be forcibly ran, to solve some type issues or columns conflictingmine situation.p  pis this  what part of down works for  p

Sometime they have a business id, for example Product can be found by its unique ProductId which has 3 fields  id, type, repository.p  pIn our database, the Product table has a surrogate primary key column OID in addition to the 3 business columns  id, type, repository to facilitate foreign keys references and to have less joins clauses.p  pThe ProductProductId classes are part of the API that we expose to other applications.

Negative 97 pIm studying eCommerce like web application. In one case study, Im in trouble of mass data validation. What is the best practice of that in enterprise applicationp  pHere is one scenariop  pFor a cargo system. There is a Cargo object, which contains a list of  Good to be shipped with. Each Good have a string field, named Category, specifying what kind of Good it is. Such as inflammable, Fragile.p  pSo, there are two chances for the validation to take place. The creation of the object. Or the storage in the database of the object. If we only validate at the storage stage, when some Good validation fails, the Cargo storage fails too, and the previously stored Goods need to be deleted. This is low efficient. If we also validate at the creation stage. There will be duplicated validation logica check of foreign key as I stores  those Category in the database, and a check in the constructor.p

Negative 97 pSimple problem. Im working on a Delphi 2007WIN32 application which now uses MS Access as simple data store. I have to modify it to support SQL Server Express, which is easy. These modifications are working so the application can be deployed using either SQL Server or MS Access. Whatever the user prefers. I did consider deploying the whole application together with the SQL Compact but this is not practicak. Using SQL Server Express 2008 instead of 2005 is an option, but also has a few nasty sideeffects which we dont want to resolve for now.p  pThe problem is deploying the whole project. The installation with SQL Server would need a quiet installation so the user wont notice it. SQL Server is mentioned in the documentation so they know its there. We just dont want to bother them with technical issues. In most cases, such an installation will go just fine.p  pBut what if the user already has an SQL Server 2005 installation which is used for something else Personally, I would prefer to just install a second instance of SQL Server on their system so it wont conflict with the other installation. Thus, if they uninstall the other app, the SQL instance will just stay installed.p  pWhile SQL Server 2005 and 2008 can be installed on the same system simply by using two different names for the instance, I wonder if its also possible to install SQL Server 2005 twice on a single system to get two instances. And if possible, howp

Negative 97 pI am working on a piece of 3D software that has sometimes has to perform intersections between massive numbers of curves sometimes 100,000. The most natural way to do this is to do an N2 bounding box check, and then those curves whose bounding boxes overlap get intersected.p  pI heard good things about octrees, so I decided to try implementing one to see if I would get improved performance. p  pHeres my design Each octree node is implemented as a class with a list of subnodes and an ordered list of object indices.p  pWhen an object is being added, its added to the lowest node that entirely contains the object, or some of that nodes children if the object doesnt fill all of the children.p  pNow, what I want to do is retrieve all objects that share a tree node with a given object. To do this, I traverse all tree nodes, and if they contain the given index, I add all of their other indices to an ordered list. p  pThis is efficient because the indices within each node are already ordered, so finding out if each index is already in the list is fast. However, the list ends up having to be resized, and this takes up most of the time in the algorithm. So what I need is some kind of treelike data structure that will allow me to efficiently add ordered data, and also be efficient in memory. p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 97 pWe use ODP.NET to perform queries on Oracle databases, and normally it works fine. There is a particular database, and a particular view in that database, though, that we just cant complete a query on from .NET. For examplep  precodeSELECT somevarcharfield FROM theview WHERE ROWNUM lt 5 codepre  pIf I execute this query from within Oracle SQL developer, it finishes in less than a second. If I do an identical query from our .NET application using ODP.NET, it hangs and eventually produces an ORA03135 connection lost contact error. I think that limiting it to just a few rows eliminates the possibility that it is as FetchSize issue.p  pThere are other queries I can execute successfully, but they are slower from our program than from SQL Developer. Again, I realize SQL Developer only gets data for the first 50 rows initially, but I think the ROWNUM condition takes that out of the equation.p  pWhat might be different about the connection or command that Oracle SQL Developer is using vs the one our application is using that would cause a difference in speedp  pUnfortunately, I do not have access to the server other than to run Oracle queries against it.p  pThank you.p  pUPDATE I have tried the same query with Microsofts Oracle provider and it executes very quickly. Unfortunately, that provider is deprecated so this is not a long term solution.p
Negative 97 pConsider the following simplified scenariop  precodepublic class Person      public string Name  get set       public int Age  get set        restricted     public string SocialSecurityNumber  get set        restricted     public string MothersMaidenName  get set   codepre  pSo, in the application, many users can view codePersoncode data. Some users can view all other users can view only codeNamecode and codeAgecode.p  pHaving the UI display only authorized data is easy enough on the client side, but I really dont want to even send that data to the client.p  pIve tried to achieve this by creating a codeFullPerson  BasicPersoncode hierarchy tableperclasshierarchy. I used two implementations of a codeStaffRepositorycode to get the desired type, but the necessary casting fails at runtime because of the NH proxies. Of course in the RDBMS any given row in the codePeoplecode table can represent a codeFullPersoncode or a codeBasicPersoncode, and giving them both the same discriminator value does not work either.p  pI considered mapping only codeFullPersoncode and using codeAliasToBeancode result transformer to filter down to codeBasicPersoncode, but I understand this to be a oneway street, whereas I want the full benefit of entity management and lazy loading though the example above doesnt include collections in the session.p  pAnother thought I had was to wrap up all the restricted fields into a class and add this as a property. My concerns with this approach are severalp  ol liIt compromises my domain model,li liId have to declare the property as a collection always of 1 in order to have it load lazily, andli liIm not even sure how Id prevent that lazy collection from loading.li ol  pAll this feels wrong. Is there a known approach to achieve the desired resultp  h3clarificationh3  pThis in an intranetonly desktop application the session lives on the client. While I can certainly create an intermediate service layer, I would have to give up lazy loading and change tracking, which Id really like to keep in place.p

Negative 97 pI have a django webapp with multiple users logging in and fill in a form.  p  pSome users may start filling in a form and lack some required data e.g., a grant  needed to validate the form and before we can start working on it.  I want them to be able to fill out the form and have an option to save the partial info so another day they can log back in and complete it or submit the full info undergoing validation.p  pCurrently Im using ModelForm for all the forms I use, and the Model has constraints to ensure valid data e.g., the grant  has to be unique.  However, I want them to be able to save this intermediary data without undergoing any validation.p  pThe solution Ive thought of seems rather inelegant and undjangoey  create a Save Partial Form button that saves the POST dictionary converts it to a a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibraryshelve.htmlshelfa file and create a SavedPartialForm model connecting the user to partial forms saved in the shelf.  Does this seem sensible  Is there a better way to save the POST dict directly into the db  Or is an addon module that does this partialsave of a form which seems to be a fairly common activity with webforms  p  pMy biggest concern with my method is I want to eventually be able to do this formautosave automatically say every 10 minutes in some ajaxjquery method without actually pressing a button and sending the POST request e.g., so the user isnt redirected off the page when autosave is triggered.  Im not that familiar with jquery and am wondering if it would be possible to do this.p

Negative 97 pI have a view built in Interface Builder, which contains a subview that should be a fixed distance from the bottom of the screen. At runtime, I create a container view, which holds a UINavigationControllers view and push a UIViewController subclass inited with the relevant XIB to the UINavigationControllers stack.p  pSo far so good. When the application runs with a normal status bar, everything is fine. However, when the app runs with a doubleheight status bar either a current call or internet tethering or whatever, the subview I referred to is shifted down a bit. Which youd expect.p  pWhats really got me tearing my hair out is how to correct this. Both the container view and my custom UIViewControllers view appear to have bthe same boundsb when the app runs with either status bar  just that a yposition of 300.0 in my XIB view or whatever seems to be different depending on the size of the status bar. I have tried to calculate the absolute screen position of my subview and convert to local coords using code[ UIWindow convertPointfromWindow ]code and code[ UIView convertPointfromViewnil ]code, which still show an offset.p  pMy view hierarchy looks like thisbr Windowbr Root container viewbr UINavigationController viewbr XIB viewp  pA clue lies in the class of superview of the XIB at runtime codeUILayoutContainerViewcode. I assume this is some kind of smart resizing view being used by the UINavigationController to manage its subviews. Could this be the culprit for this offsettingp  pI could just get the height of the status bar, check if its doubleheight and do some absolute offsetting based on that. However, this feels like exactly the kind of hack thatll come back to bite me on the ass if anything else changes the screens rect, or new revisions of iOS cause resizing rules amp sizes to change or whatever. Plus, Id have to implement these offsets across a number of XIBbuilt views in the app, which all exhibit the same offsetting. Interestingly enough, all of the runtimegenerated views are fine.p  pSo, my questions are how can I fix this offsetting in a generalpurpose, flexible way Is UINavigationController amp UILayoutContainerView to blame for the offsettingp  pThere are those who will say this question betrays an ignorance of Interface Builder features. If you understood how to set up autoresizing properties properly, you wouldnt have this problem, to which I would reply Yes absolutely Please tell me how to set up autoresizing properties properlyp

Negative 97 pI want to design a custom items control panel for a codeListBoxcode.

This is what the panel should look like colors are irrelevant, I just wanted to show that the panel is consisted of 12 empty cells in a 3x4 matrix  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtMin9.png altalt textpli lipIf the number of items in the items control is less than the number of defined cells all the cells should be drawn. E.g. if there are only 4 items to be placed in a 3x4 matrix shown in the picture, all of the cells should be drawn and only 4 of them should contain the items. pli lipIt should be possible to set which cell will host which item, via some data binding. For example, lets say I had a list of persons. That list contains items of type codePersoncode and the codePersoncode class contains two properties codeXcode and codeYcode. I should be able to data bind codeXcode to the coderowcode of the cell and codeYcode to the codecolumncode of the cell, thus allowing myself to set which cell in the panel will contain which person from the list. pli ol  pIf creating the items control panel doesnt make sense, please recommend what would be the better approach. To be quite honest I am puzzled on how to even get started with this. Thanks for all the help. Cheersp

Negative 97 pI am experimenting with spring, maven, and eclipse but stumbling on a weird issue.p  pI am running Eclipse Helios SR1 with the STS Spring tools suite plugin which includes the Maven plugin also. p  pWhat i want to achieve is a spring mvc webapp which uses an application context loaded from a local application context xml file, but also from other application contexts in jar files dependencies included in WEBINFlib. p  pWhat id ultimately like to do is have my persistence layer separated in its own jar file but containing its own spring context files with persistence specific configuration e.g a jpa entityManagerFactory for example. p  pSo to experiment with loading resources from jar dependencies,  i created a simple maven project from eclipse, which defines an applicationContext.xml file in srcmainresources Inside, i define a bean p  precodeltbean idmybean classorg.test.MyClass gt codepre  pand create the class in the org.test packagep  pI run mvninstall from eclipse, which generates me a jar file containing my class and the applicationContext.xml filep  precode testproj.jar METAINF org     test          MyClass.class applicationContext.xml codepre  pI then create a spring mvc project from the Spring template projects provided by STS.  I have configured an instance of Tomcat 7.0.8 , and also an instance of springSource tc Server within eclipse. Deploying the newly created project on both servers works without problem.p  pI then add my previous project as a maven dependency of the mvc project. the jar file is correctly added in the Maven Dependencies of the project.p  pIn the web.xml that is generated, i now want to load the applicationContext.xml from the jar file as well as the existing one generated for the project. My web.xml now looks like thisp  p              org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener     p  precodelt Processes application requests gt ltservletgt     ltservletnamegtappServletltservletnamegt     ltservletclassgtorg.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServletltservletclassgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtcontextConfigLocationltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegt             classpathapplicationContext.xml,             WEBINFspringappServletservletcontext.xml         ltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltloadonstartupgt1ltloadonstartupgt ltservletgt  ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtappServletltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt codepre  pAlso, in my servletcontext.xml, i have the following  p  precodeltcontextcomponentscan basepackageorg.test gt ltcontextcomponentscan basepackageorg.remy.mvc gt codepre  pto load classes from the jar spring context org.test and to load controllers from the mvc app context.p  pI also change one of my controllers in org.remy.mvc to autowire MyClass to verify that loading the context has worked as intended.p  precodepublic class MyController   Autowired     private MyClass myClass      public void setMyClassMyClass myClass          this.myClass  myClass           public MyClass getMyClass          return myClass       [...]   codepre  pNow this is the weird bitp  pIf i deploy the spring mvc web on my tomcat instance inside eclipse run on server...

Negative 97 pI have two arrows on a slider, pointing left and right. On hovering over these arrows, I want the arrows to expand to say Prev or Next, depending on which one is selected.p  pOn the left arrow, this is fine, as I set the whole div to contain the arrow image, and then the word PREV, and set the size of the container so that only the arrow is visible. Then on rollover, I have the width of the container increase.p  pHowever, this tactic doesnt work on the right arrow, as the arrow presents itself and then on hover the word NEXT appears to the right of it, whereas I want it on the left. If I put the word before the arrow, then I only see the word and not the arrow until hovering over it.p  pIs there any way using CSS andor jQuery to show only the rightmost element data, and then have the width increase to the left on hover Ideally I want to turn this into an animate function, and dont want to have to use two images  one with the arrow, and one with the arrow and text.p  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp  pDanp  pEDITp  pHave just found out about JSFIDDLE, so have copied my code minus the images atm to there at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netVzNFw relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netVzNFwa with the modifications suggested however I would like to get the formatting a bit better on the word displaying.

Negative 97 pI have a question how to best architecture my solution using Entity Framework in a windows service.p  pI want to provide an online webservice which allows users to execute possibly long running tasks, watch the progress of the tasks, cancel them, etc.p  pSo far I am using a windows service to actually execute the tasks which exposes WCF endpoints to queue new work and manage existing tasks.p  pI am using Entity Framework to store a history of all jobs. However I am not completely sure how I should model the interaction between the background process of executing the jobs with current progress inforation and the wcf services exposing this status.p  pShould I completely seperate both parts, letting the background process periodically write the current state to the database and the WCF services poll the information from therep  pOr does it make sense that the WCF service directly gets the information from the background process accessing a static member or something similar Should they share a DataContextp  pI would like to have the information current and it seems a bit strange having both the background processing and the WCF service running in the same process, but then communicating via the database, but on the other hand it seems to be a nicer architecture...p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 97 pI want to design a webapp that can print signs for various products, such as a big store. The content of the signs product names , descriptions ,prices  comes from the server and changes daily.  Each product can be printed to a A3 or A4 document.

In addition each product type has a differently desinged sign Tvs have the price on the top of the page in RED, and printers have the price on bottom left in BOLD p  pthe idea is that the program will get the product data from the DB, push it in inside a html template according to the page size and product type and print the html or convert the html to pdf and printp  psome problems I faced so far  textfields from the DB can be to long, and overlap an area with other texts or scramble the rest of the sign.  there are many product types and each one has its own html design and css  so its very hard to  maintain if i need to change things .  different browsers show the sign differently .  different printers print the sign differently.p  pWhat would be the best way to approach the problem could css frameworks help Im open for ideas.p

Im voting to close this question.p  hr  pWhen a user logs in, I inflate the session with a bunch of data from the Login page codebehind. Then I redirect the user to a different page in the application. I also have some session recovery logic which reinflates the session based on the auth ticket when the users session expires. p  pWhat seems to be happening is that I inflate the users session with a bunch of data from the login page, then redirect them, and the request for the page to which I redirect them doesnt seem to have the session, so the application has to reinflate it. I dont understand this  Ive looked at the cookie and the session ID is not changing, and I am not resetting the session data anywhere in the code. Is this an ASP .NET feauture Im using ASP .NET 4.0.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pTo clarify The session is inflated during the login request on the click even of the login button. During the next request, it doesnt appear the session is populated any longer, so I end up having to reinflate the session. Any requests that user makes after that, the session seems to stick and I have the properly inflated session for subsequent requests.p

Negative 97 pI am trying to get my head around MVVM and the Navigationbased project template in SL4. At the moment I am trying to move the ContentFrameNavigated event handler into the ViewModel. Basically this event handler checks each hyperlink button in the menu bar against the current page and adjusts the style accordingly. To do this it seems I need to pass the EventArgs as well as another object. I see MVVM Light has the PassEventArgsToCommand bit, but what about passing another objectcontrol In this case its the StackPanel hosting the list of menu item hyperlinks. Im just getting my head around the MVVM concept, whats the best practice in this casep  pCheers, Dany.p

Negative 97 pIn my application I am continually writing data to strongfile1strong and flushing it to the device. In another thread, I am reading data from strongfile1strong and writing it to strongfile2strong.  p  pEvery time I do the strongfwrite  fflushstrong on file1, I signal to the other thread to start reading from it. The other thread reads data from file1 and dumps it into file2. Pretty simple logic. Additionally, after every few minutes, I seek back to start of file1 and start overwriting old data.  p  pNow my problem is that once I start overwriting data in strongfile1strong, the data read into file2 is strongsometimesstrong the old data i.e. data written in the previous iteration even though writer thread has signaled that it wrote the new data and flushed it.  p  pI am writing to and reading from a solid state drive 128 GB SAMSUNG 470 Series, if that helps on [C  linux  arm platfrom]. I feel that there is an issue with the processor cache. Perhaps the strongwritestrong goes into the cache and the strongreadstrong by the reader thread comes from the flash, and hence the stale data.  p  pThe catch here is that this problem occurs if the SSD is formatted with NTFS. If I format it with ext3, the problem goes away. Unfortunately, NTFS is a hard requirement. Another interesting observation is that if I have two reader threads, both get stale data at different instants.  p  pEvent after disabling the SSD write cache with stronghdparm W0 devsda1strong, I get the same problem with NTFS. I am badly stuck up with this since more than a week.  p  pAny idea what is happening, and why is it happening that way  p  pAny help will be worth its weight in gold...  p  pstrongEDITstrong Turns out that the NTFS driver does not like me overwriting a file by rewinding the file pointer.

But as the view returned in the first example goes back to ObjC and has no managed reference, the GC will clean the managed version away. This puzzles me a bit.

Negative 97 pI need to implement a class in C that can call a C function from unmanaged C and return a value. Ive done this from C to C using MIDLRPC binding over named pipe which works great but now my server application is moving to C but the client must remain unmanaged C its an explorer extension.p  pIve looked at various methods and lots of people suggest COM, it was my understanding that COM was not so much for IPCRPC but for hosting a served object in a client app. Is this going to be possible with COM, if so, can anyone point me in the direction of a good reference or examplep  pEDITp  pJust to be clear, I cannot use managed code as the client DLL is loaded into Explorers process space. p  pWhat I am trying to achieve is when the user rightclicks on a file the extension will ask a running service session 0 for some details about the file.

Negative 97 pGenerally i like to keep my database as clean and expandable as possible.p  pHowever after doing some tests, I realised that whilst this is usually the best way to do it, when dealing with large datasets its a lot slower than what i refer to as the dirty approach to the problem.p  pBasically lets say i have a table of objects. These objects belong to certain people. One object may have one person, whilst others more than 1. My initial thought was as I always do, create an objects table for my objects, a peoples table for my people, and then a objecttopeople linker table.p  pHowever joining the object and linker table in order to get all objects a person is assigned to, can take up to 3 seconds thats based on around 400k records, but only 1 link per object. Yes i also set up indexs e.c.t. to try and speed things up.p  pIf I instead remove the people and linker table, and put the people in the objects table as columns and use 10 to set whether each person is assigned to that object, without joining the two large tables i see a speed of around 0.3  0.7 seconds varied greatly.p  pTo begin with, we only need 2 people. But I dont want to be too restrictive if i can help it. I know I can use caching and what not to improve the end user timings, but is there any reason this would be considered a really bad idea to use columns rather than link tablesp

Negative 97 pUsing Android 2.1.

Negative 97 pI wrote some codemapreducecode jobs that reference a few external jars. so I added them into the CLASSPATH of the running cluster in order to run jobs.p  pOnce I tried to run them, I got class not found exceptions. I Googled for ways to fix it and I found that I needed to restart the cluster for applying the changed CLASSPATH, and it actually worked.p  pOh, yuck Should I really need to restart a cluster every time I add new jars into the CLASSPATH I dont think that it makes sense.p  pDoes anyone know how to apply the changes without restarting themp  hr  pI think I need to add some detail to beg your advice.p  pI wrote a custom codehbasecode filter class and packed it in a jar. And I wrote a codemapreducecode job that uses the custom filter class and packed it in an another jar. Because the filter class jar wasnt in the class path of my running cluster, I added it.

And Im curious I should restart the cluster again if I need to add new external jarsp

Negative 97 pIve always been dabbling in javascript, but never really got hugely into writing a lot of javascript until last year or so. One thing I noticed is that my javascript started to grow so complex, that parts of it were more complex than the servers application code minus all the framework code of course, such as Spring or Hibernate.p  pThis caused me to realize that if you want to write a complex javascript application, in the same way youve been writing complex web applications on the server, you have to start thinking about best practices, architecture, how you structure your files, how you test your code, what abstractions do you use to create smaller, more reusable components, what is the best way to pass parameters and send messages, should i pass parameters or object literals, and just best practices all around. None of this provided or encouraged by Javascript itself, and everyone seems to have its own way of going about everything.p  pAnd of course, because Javascript offers such very poor api out of the box, I often spend a countless amount of time researching what the best tools for the job are. Facilities like importing files and dependencies, or even a basic collection library, are things NOT handled by the language. Lets not forget that IDE support, even in something like Idea 10.5, is actually pretty bad and nowhere near as rich as say Java due to its dynamic nature and the lack of these hardbindings for packages and imports.p  pOutside of jquery, which I really like and feel comfortable with, I still havent made any decisions as to the right way to do things either. This is odd to me.p  pEveryone seems to have their own coding idioms too  they either write in a pure functional style, or they try and create a whole classical programming model and then use that. Peoples coding standards and idioms vary from library to library and person to person. All of this makes knowing what the right thing to do an incredible task.p  pEven worse, there doesnt seem to be books on this sort of thing.

Negative 97 h1TLDRh1  pI have an codeIHttpHandlercode that performs compression. It works fine on its own. But then I added an codeIHttpModulecode that performs a completely unrelated task on those and all other responses, and now IIS is recompressing the alreadycompressed responses. How can I prevent thisp  h1The Whole Storyh1  pI have an codeIHttpHandlercode implementation that performs combination and compression among other things for CSS and JS files. Everything in the codeIHttpHandlercode works exactly like I want it to.p  pBut then I added an codeIHttpModulecode implementation that removes unnecessary response headers codeServercode, codeXAspNetVersioncode, etc. from strongallstrong responses including the dynamic responses that are generated by the codeIHttpHandlercode during the codePreSendRequestHeaderscode event.p  pHowever, it seems that simply registering an codeIHttpModulecode, regardless of what it actually does, causes IIS to apply compression to the response, even if the response is already compressed.p  pSo, my codeIHttpHandlercode explicitly compresses the response and sets the codeContentEncodingcode header, then if and only if the codeIHttpModulecode is also registered, IIS recompresses the response so theres a doublycompressed response that browsers cant read.p  pI dont want to disable all default compression. I still want HTML from views to be compressed and I want any CSS and JS that doesnt go through the codeIHttpHandlercode to also be defaultcompressed.p  pIm guessing theres no easy solution to my problem because it seems like a bug in IIS. IIS should not compress a response that is already compressed.p  pI tried adding the following to my web.config, but it had no effectp  precodelthttpCompressiongt     ltdynamicTypesgt         ltadd mimeTypetextcss enabledfalse gt         ltadd mimeTypeapplicationjavascript enabledfalse gt     ltdynamicTypesgt lthttpCompressiongt codepre  pFrom my interpretation of the a hrefhttpwww.iis.netConfigReferencesystem.webServerhttpCompressiondynamicTypes relnofollowdocumentationa, that should disable compression for dynamically generated CSS and JS.p  pI also tried this, to no effectp  precodelthttpCompressiongt     ltdynamicTypesgt         ltcleargt     ltdynamicTypesgt     ltstaticTypesgt         ltcleargt     ltstaticTypesgt lthttpCompressiongt codepre  pFrom my interpretation of the documentation, that should disable strongallstrong default compression.p  h1Updateh1  pIn my codeIHttpHandlercode, I call codecontext.Response.Flushcode at the very end. If I remove this call, the response doesnt get doublecompressed. Im fine with this as a solution. Can anyone explain why this is happeningp  h1Update 2h1  pMy best guess is that calling codeFlushcode puts the response into such a state that IIS doesnt think the response is already compressed and so it applies default compression. Even though in my module I can check both...p  ul lithat codeResponse.Headerscode contains a codeContentEncodingcode header andli lithat codeResponse.Filtercode is noncodenullcode and is one of the codeSystem.IO.Compressioncode types.li ul  pNot sure why IIS cant determine that the response is already compressed from those facts.p

The thread is still sleeping.li liThe codePeriodicTaskcode would see the new update interval only after the 60 seconds have expired.li ul  pThe exact requirement is that the new update intervals should be effective immediately or at least no later than 1 second after being set  since that is what the user is likely to perceive anyway.p  pMy Snippet2 and Snippet3 are attempts at achieving this requirement.p

Negative 97 pWhat is the best method for writing a custom adapter for a large database  The database in question is a media library which I have scanned in from userselected sources.  My goal is to cache media information into an SQLite database and then display it with a custom adapter.p  pThe database has only one table, MYLIBRARY, which stores one song information per row in this formatp  pp  precodeid  Integer, autoincrements  ARTIST  Text, artist name  ALBUM  Text, album name  YEAR  Text, song year  TRACK  Integer, track number of song  TITLE  Text, song title  PATH  Text, full path to file  TIME  Integer, total length of song  DISC  Integer, used for multidisc albums codepre  pData is scanned into the database in no particular order, I just build a list of files with a recursive directory search and then dump them into a tag reading library to extract information.p  pMy full music library is stored on my SMB server, mounted via CIFS on my tablet.  I have scanned 8000 songs into the database.  Then I created a custom CursorAdapter and used this query to generate the cursorp  precodeviewCursorQuery  SELECT  FROM MYLIBRARY ORDER BY ARTIST, ALBUM, DISC, TRACK codepre  pThis works nicely on the database I generated for my ondevice media which is at most 50 songs and also works nicely on my remote library for the first 14 or so of the list fast scrolling enabled.  However, once I scroll deeper into the list it starts lagging and lagging and eventually shows an ANR.  If I wait, it will eventually complete the scroll.p  pAs I have read in other posts, CursorAdapter does not appear to work well with large databases.  I would really like to have the ability to show all media at once I will have options to categorize by artistyearetc but still want the option to show all.  I have a few ideas that I wanted to get feedback on.p  pstrong1.  LimitOffsetstrong Create a custom Adapter that queries 100200 items at a time, and then when the end of the data is reached, query 100200 more items.  This solves the problem of eating up large RAM with 8000line Cursors, but SQLite does not recommend this a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgcvstracwikipScrollingCursor relnofollowherea.p  pstrong2.  Dual Cursor LimitOffsetstrong To speed this up, I was also thinking about using 2 Cursors, each with 100200 items but instead of requerying when the list scrolls beyond the available data, asynchronously requery the second cursor as the list scrolls halfway through the first, then swap them for smoother list scrolling.  This still suffers from the offset problem mentioned on that page.p  pstrong3.  Comparisonstrong According to the page a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgcvstracwikipScrollingCursor relnofollowherea, SQLite is fast when comparing to the previous firstlast track.  However, their example is for one data field while my query selects from a larger set.  Im not entirely sure how to implement this with the data set Im using.p  pstrong4.  Reorganize data to improve speedstrong I would prefer not to do this, but if there is a better way to store the data possibly hierarchical  artist  album  track and still be able to sort by multiple fields, I could change the way data is stored.p  pSo, Im simply looking for insight on which method or any other methods I havent discovered would work best.  This is my first experience using SQL and Im still fairly new to Android coming from a CC heavy background.p

Negative 97 pI am currently working on a Java plugin for Netbeans 6.9.1 using the Apache POI api for interfacing with Microsoft documents that has two functions, the first takes data from a properties text file and creates an excel spreadsheet.xlsx containing that data, and the second part takes text from a spreadsheet and adds it to a properties text file. p  pWhen I run the code in the debugger both of the functions work great. The files get created and edited as they are supposed to, but I ran into problems when I created the NBM from the project and installed the plugin. The import from .xlsx to .txt does not do change the contents of the text file. I have checked variables at various times in the code to make sure theres nothing wrong with them there and everything was as it should. The export .txt to .xlsx works fine in the plugin, so Im not sure exactly whats going on. When I start the import it goes through the steps, but nothing ever gets changed or written to the final files.p  pIm pretty new to Netbeans so Im not sure if there is a major difference from debugger to the actual plugin that is affecting how the program acts.

Negative 97 pSo Im working on a website with a lot of many to many data base relationships, and because I am still a bit new to querying relational databases, I am struggling a bit. so I have several tables that I am trying to get related data from.

Negative 97 pI have a .net c library that I have created that I am currently creating some unit tests for. I am at present writing unit tests for a cache provider class that I have created. Being new to writing unit tests I have 2 questions These beingp  ol lipMy cache provider class is the abstraction layer to my distributed cache  AppFabric. So to test aspects of my cache provider class such as adding to appfabric cache, removing from cache etc involves communicating with appfabric. Therefore the tests to test for such, are they still categorised as unit tests or integration testspli lipThe above methods I am testing due to interacting with appfabric, I would like to time such methods. If they take longer than a specified benchmark, the tests have failed. Again I ask the question, can this performance benchmark test be classifed as a unit testpli ol  pThe way I have my tests set up I want to include all unit tests together, integration tests together etc, therefore I ask these questions that I would appreciate input on.p

Negative 97 pI am creating a noir webapp, and I need to dynamically create new views and models. Ive been following the noir examples, in which the view and the controller for a resource have separate namespaces, and Ive found it to be a very clean approach.p  pIn keeping with this, I need to be able to dynamically create new namespaces corresponding to views and models, and then intern the appropriate functions in them. My idea was to have macros specified in a separate namespace which, when called in the new namespace, would provide the appropriate routespartialswhatever. p  pFor example forgive my first defmacrop  precodens project.views.proto   use noir.core         hiccup.core         hiccup.element         hiccup.form  defmacro defallpage   [path]   defpage path []      html       [h1 Yall here] codepre  pis called from...p  precodens project.proto    use [clojure.contrib.withns only [withns]]  createns foo intern foo path path   In reality, the path is dynamic which is why I intern it withns foo     clojure.corereferclojure     use noir.core          hiccup.core          hiccup.element          [project.views.proto only [defallpage]]      defallpage path codepre  pHowever, calling this from within my new namespace gives me a NullPointerException. Id greatly appreciate any help, and whether or not there is a better approach.

Sop  precodePublic Class Two     Public Sub Show         MsgBoxOne.NumericUpDown.Value     End Sub End Class codepre  pNow everything works as it should be. I click the codeButtoncode, the default  codeNumericUpDown.Valuecode shows. I adjust the value, click the codeButtoncode, the adjusted value shows.p  pHow is assigning codeDim o as New Onecode changing this behaviourp  pThis is my first week of coding with vb.net, so I might be doing things that dont make sense, but work for me. The only reason I put codeDim o as New Onecode in my actual code is that then I did not have to type One every time I referenced to the class,  but just had to type o. Apparently this is not the way to go, but I am curious to know why.p

Negative 97 pIm trying to use MediaElement.js on a site and everything works great in every browser but IE, most specifically IE9 Im not too concerned with supporting below IE9 at the moment.  Im populating the ME dynamically which Ive read can cause problems in IE specifically, but Im just not sure if there is a workaround.

Negative 97 pSo far I have gotten this applet to a working stage The only problem is that it only works if the mouse is moving If the mouse is not moved, then the entire thing grinds to a halt. It starts working again if the mouse is moved.p  pThe way that it works is the paint method is called by mouseMoved method. Each time the the mouse is moved, it goes threw the paint method, and the game continues. The problem arises from when the mouseMoved method isnt called, so the paint method does not get called, and the entire thing just pauses until the mouse is moved.p  pI have tried the followingp  pHaving the paint method be recursive so it will call itself. The problem with this is that then the mouselistener does not work, because the program is to busy painting a bunch of stuff moving around.p  pI also tried using threads so that the mouselistener would interrupt the paint method.

Negative 97 pI have a List with a large amount of elements in it. I need to create a copy of this list to perform operations on it without altering the original list. However, the operations typically only access a small proportion of the elements of the list, and so it is inefficient to copy the entire thing when most of it will go unused.

Negative 97 pIm developing a last.fm widget, and one of the requisites is, for each track that is displayed of a certain tag genre, a small button must be present.

To my mind, the only thing significantly different is the set of texture2D callsp  precodeNSString const kDilationFragmentShaderString  SHADERSTRING   precision highp float  uniform int height  uniform int width  varying highp vec2 textureCoordinate  uniform sampler2D inputImageTexture  uniform int radius    void main void      vec2 uv  textureCoordinate    vec2 theSize  vec2width, height    vec3 theMax  texture2DinputImageTexture, uv.rgb     int i    int j    int radsqr  radiusradius    for j  radius j lt radius j        for i  radius i lt radius i          if i  i  j  j gt radsqr continue        theMax  maxtheMax, texture2DinputImageTexture, uv  vec2i,jtheSize.rgb               glFragColor  vec4theMax, 1.0      codepre  pIm running this filter, and then a second filter with a minimum ie, morphological dilation and then an erosion, or a morphological close operator.p  pI do realize that a more optimal way to implement this is to try to get all the texture2D calls into their own locations via the vertex shader however, if the radius is 10, that calls for 314 vertices, which blows past the allowed number of locations.  If I run these in the simulator and all other things are equal, then the first finishes just fine, but the second code blows memory up and the memory climbs dramatically for the call of the erosion filter.  Running on an iPhone 4s, the first code fragment finishes just fine and of course, very quickly, but the second code fragment crashes after the dilation, and does not run the erosion call.p  pInitially, it looks like texture2D is leaking however, these functions are being called in a thread.  When the thread exits, all memory is cleared in the simulator.  As a result, the functions, if they work right the first time, can be run multiple times with no problem.p  pSo my question is this  What is the texture2D call doing there that could cause this behavior  Is there a way to flush whatever buffer is created once the filter has completed, independently of ending the thread between calls  p  pEDIT  Something Ive learned in the week since posting this question  The problem is in the for loops themselves.  Remove the for loops, and the memory problem disappears.  That is, p  precodeNSString const kDilationFragmentShaderString  SHADERSTRING   precision highp float  uniform int height  uniform int width  varying highp vec2 textureCoordinate  uniform sampler2D inputImageTexture  uniform int radius    void main void      vec2 uv  textureCoordinate    vec2 theSize  vec2width, height    vec3 theMax  texture2DinputImageTexture, uv.rgb     int i    int j    int radsqr  radiusradius    for j  radius j lt radius j        for i  radius i lt radius i                 glFragColor  vec4theMax, 1.0      codepre  pwill allocate as much memory as if there were something happening inside of the loop.  Im determining this behavior through the inspector on the simulator.  When I run a shader with no for loops on a 1280x1280 image, I get a total of 202 mb allocated, and when I run it with for loops, I get 230 mb allocated, regardless of what happens inside the for loop.  The same behavior happens with while loops as well.  p

Negative 97 pIm using Anlr 3.5 to generate a parser and lexer from the below included grammar. This grammar is to be used to read strings so as to convert them into an object graph for later evaluation. I however am having issues when I attempt to use a emunaryExpressionem clause, doing so throws a class cast exception reportingp  blockquote   pUnable to cast object of type operandExpressionreturn to type unaryExpressionreturn.p blockquote  pOne example input that causes this is p  precode[p1 eq p1Value] and [p2 eq p2Value] or [p3 gt p3Value] codepre  pit appears to be the parenthesis unaryExpression that explicitly trigger the exception. Running the same statement minus the parenthesis  appears to properly parse, as does the sub expression within the parenthesis.p  pI can clearly see via the exception the wrong type is being used. I just dont follow as to why it is being chosen by the parser nor what correction the grammar needs to avoid this error.p  pOf note each the two branches of the expression clause do have multiple matching alternatives with each of the binaryOperator branches, but from my understanding this should be ok only causing a less efficient greedy parser and not causing the errors Im seeing.p  pGrammar

Negative 97 pI am a novice programmer and am hoping for some help with the following situation.p  pI am able to read in a local external CSV file and display as an HTML table with jQuery csvToTable a hrefhttpcode.google.compjquerycsvtotable relnofollowhttpcode.google.compjquerycsvtotablea.

I can, on the other hand, modify the color of the entire table, but this is not the real goal.  All of this makes me think that, despite the appearance of a wellformatted HTML table created by csvToTable, there may not actually be any table rows there to manipulate at all.p  pI know there could be something very basic that I am missing due to my lack of experience, so sorry in advance if that turns out to be the case.

Negative 97 pI am having some trouble resolving a race condition that arises when acquiring a lock. I have a large computation that is triggered asynchronously. I need my previous synchronous task to end before the large task begins. The large task launches and waits on a condition variable and, in an ideal world, the small tasks will notify the condition variable when they are done. My problem comes from the large task starting too soon, and the small tasks trigger a condition variable that has yet to full initialize and thus does not actually trigger, causing the program to be locked.p  pI have boiled it down to this minimal example. p  pI would assume this is a common problem. How can I check that my condition variable has actually got hold of a mutex and is lockedp  precodeinclude ltQCoreApplicationgt include ltQObjectgt include ltQFuturegt include ltQtConcurrentQtConcurrentgt include ltQFutureWatchergt include ltQWaitConditiongt  class workUnit public QObject      QOBJECT      public     workUnitQObject parent              m  new QMutex         mgtlock         wnew QWaitCondition          QWaitCondition w     QMutex m  public slots     void runMe              wgtwaitm         mgtunlock         perform long computation         int mainint argc, char argv[]      QCoreApplication aargc, argv     workUnit mUnitnew workUnitampa     QFutureWatcherltvoidgt w     QObjectconnectampw, SIGNALfinished, ampa, SLOTquit     QFutureltvoidgt f  QtConcurrentrunmUnit,ampworkUnitrunMe     w.setFuturef     sleep1000with this delay it works, without the delay it doesnt     mUnitgtwgtwakeAllThis would be triggered by another process     return a.exec  codepre

Negative 97 pI am trying to get a better understanding of how hashtables and dictionaries work in C from a complexity perspective but I guess the language is not an important factor, thats probably just a theoretical question.p  pI know that the method codeAddcode of a codeDictionarycode is supposed to be O1 if codeCountcode is less than the capacity which is kind of obvious.p  pHowever, lets look at that codep  precodepublic class Foo      public Foo       public override int  GetHashCode          return 5 arbitrary value, purposely a constant       static void Mainstring[] args      DictionaryltFoo, intgt test  new DictionaryltFoo,intgt     Foo a  new Foo     Foo b  new Foo      test .Adda, 5     test .Addb, 6 1. no exception raised, even though GetHashCode returns the same hash      test .Adda, 10 2. exception raised  codepre  pI understand than behind the scenes there is a collision of hashes at code1.code and theres probably a separate chaining to handle it.p  pHowever, at code2.code the argument exception is raised. That means that internally the Dictionary keeps a track of each key inserted after having determined its hash. That also means that each time we add an entry to our dictionary, it checks if the key has not already been inserted using the codeequalscode method.p  pMy question is, why is it considered to be O1 complexity when it seems like it should be On if it checks the already inserted keysp

This word will have no embedded spaces. p  pIll populate a Sample table with data that meets this critera to give you an example to make it clearp  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Sample]     [RowNumber] [int] NOT NULL,     [DataMess] [varchar]max NOT NULL  ON [PRIMARY]   INSERT [dbo].[Sample] [RowNumber], [DataMess] VALUES 1, NDate122113 12131415 Date4211 391213414 Date4113 1945512 INSERT [dbo].[Sample] [RowNumber], [DataMess] VALUES 2, NDate72113 12131415 Date82112 39123414 Date12113 1946512 INSERT [dbo].[Sample] [RowNumber], [DataMess] VALUES 3, NDate32113 12112331415 Date42813 39123414 Date91913 19456512 codepre  pFor the first record, 12131415 is considered to be the Word of data that is associated with the Date 122113. p  pHe was aked to produce the following report in SSRSp  precodeRow Number               DataMess 1                        Date 122113 12131415                           Date 4113 1945512                           Date 4211 391213414   2                        Date12113 1946512                           Date72113 12131415                           Date82112 39123414   3                        Date91913 19456512                           Date42813 39123414                           Date32113 12112331415   codepre  pNote that the Dates for each source row number are sorted in descending arder alomng with the associated wor of data.p  pI dont know SSRS, but my reaction was to recommend to him that he not even attempt the task but to tell his employer that the data shouldnt really be trying to do all of that ugly string parsing with TSQL. Instead this repeating Date DATA should be stored in individual child records that are associated with a parent Row record. I believe that the code would be ugly, inefficient, brittle and hard to maintain. What are your thoughtsp  pAssuming that managementclient is always right or to conceed that ideally this is correct, but for now we need a SQL that produces the following report, how would one do this The expectation was that this can be produced quickly  a half day, for examplep
Negative 97 pI have a table with a UID field, an in study field which will take either 0 or 1, and a text field. There are many duplicates in the text field. So far I have figured out a way to select only the first instance of the text fieldp  precodeselect text.original, minUID from tblHashtags group by text.original order by minUID codepre  pWhat I really want, however, is a oneliner that will update the in study field in all the records returned above to 1. And then it would be very nice to be able to invert this selection to update all other records to 0 as well. I am probably missing something simple but I dont play around with SQL very often, unfortunately.p  pEdit to add Having worked on this some more, I would be grateful for assistance in just doing this, nevermind the oneliner. The best I can do so far isp  precodeupdate tblHashtags set instudy1 where select text.original, minUID from tblHashtags group by text.original order by minUID Error only a single result allowed for a SELECT that is part of an expression codepre  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 97 pIm currently developing a small game for a class using Crafty, and our game requires the passage of time. To give context, its a tamagotchilike game where the player controls a creature and feeds it, grooms it, etc., when required, so we need to measure time for things such as every five minutes the creature will be hungry or after a certain amount of time say, 20 minutes the creature will die of natural causes and the game will end. My problem is that Im not sure what is the best way to go about this. Should I use setInterval setTimeout My own timer class I dont know whats the most common solution for instances like these. So far Ive tried the first two options without successful results. p  pI also tried looking for any crafy functions for time and the closest I could find was  codeCrafty.bindEnterFrame, function  ... code, so I could manipulate time frame by frame, but this didnt work either. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 97 pHello I have a problem,p  pWhen I try to upload my app to the Google Play Developer Console, it says the certificate fingerprints missmatch and shows another fingerprint than Im seeing when I export the APK via Eclipsein the last pane of the export wizard under SHA1 Fingerprint. The fingerprint Im seeing in eclipse is the correct one, I know this because I used it to generate a GoogleMaps API key and Its the same as it should be according to the missmatch error.p  pSo basically what I think is happening is that Eclipse is signing my apk with another certificate than Im telling it to use. Tough when I sign it using the debug keystore the fingerprints matchthe one im seeing in eclipse vs the one thats displayed in the missmatch error wich is very weird.p  pThis problem occured after I replaced my harddrives. But Im sure I am using the correct keystore because I backed it up before and am using the same one. Plus the fingerprint its showing in Eclipse matches the one it should be according to the error. p  pCould it have something to do with the googleplayserviceslib project thats used as a library Or because Im using another debug keystoreafter renstalling windowsp

Negative 97 pThe architecture of our application consists of several modules. The modules can run as a single process, or separately on a different server. We are using REST for the interaction between modules when they are on different servers. Now we need to process streaming data between modules. One module sends a request  another module asynchronously sends back chunks of data objects. We have tried to use KryoNet and Apache Mina. We have selected the last one and in general everything works. But the solution has several problems, and there is a feeling that we reinvent the wheel.p  pMaybe there is ready framework for creating asynchronous API to transmit streaming data and that support several transports and builtin serializationp  ul lilocal  when the modules  services interact within a single process li linetty or analog  when the modules interact with each other on different machinesli liREST  to interact with modules over HTTPli ul  pSomething like elasticsearch Java API  all operations can be performed asynchronously, through the network, locally or via REST.

Butp  ul lipWill I compromise performance for an application like thispli lipIs atomicity even what I need  I intend to write to the entire array in one go, emthenem I need it to be visible to another thread, I dont need each emindividualem write to be atomic or visible immediately.pli ul  pIf I understand correctly e.g. a hrefhttpjeremymanson.blogspot.co.uk200906volatilearraysinjava.html relnofollowthis blog posta, a self assignment, which in my case is codebuffers[currentBuffer]  buffers[currentBuffer]code will ensure publication, which you will see in my code below.p  ul lipIs this correct, that it will cause all recent writes to become visiblepli lipDoes this work in the case of a 2D array like thispli ul  hr  pIll try to overview the producer class briefly these are the instance variablesp  precode The consumer  just an interface with a processbyte[] method AudioInputConsumer consumer   The audio data source AudioSource source   The number of buffers int bufferCount   Controls the main producer loop volatile boolean isRunning  false   The actual buffers volatile byte[][] buffers   The number of buffers left to process.

Negative 97 pSupposedly one of the advantages of hybrid apps is that they shorten the deployment and AB testing cycle. Instead of having to publish the app, wait for approval, and then wait for users to update it, you can just update your HTML on the server.p  pHowever, PhoneGap amp Titanium package your HTMLCSSJS with the app distribution. Is it possible to write an native app that servers HTMLCSSJavascript from the server  p  pUPDATE Just found out about trigger.io reload functionality a hrefhttpstrigger.ioreload relnofollowhttpstrigger.ioreloada.  Thats basically what Im looking for. Does PhoneGap provide something similar p

Negative 97 pI have a service that gets started not bound by an activity. If the activity gets destroyed e.g. by pressing the back button, the service continues to run, this is of course intended. However, if I swipe the activity out of the recent apps list, the service gets restarted immediately. This is reproducible, every time the activityapp is swiped out of the list, there is a new call to the services onCreatemethod. No call to onDestroy in betweenp  pFirst I thought the service gets killed by android, even though I saw no reason for the kill neither the activity nor the service do resource consuming things, in fact they are minimalistic and do nothing.

Negative 97 pIn a Grails architecture, we have some requests where it is possible to send put in code0dcode and code0acode in the request paramaters.

Negative 97 pIm currently experimenting with model mixins, the idea being to build a small library of small abstract mixin classes defining commonly needed fields.p  pHeres what im currently playing with p  precodeclass HtmlAttrsMixinmodels.Model      cssclasses  models.CharField         maxlength256,         verbosenameCSS Classes,         blankTrue,           class Meta         abstract  True  class LinkHtmlAttrsMixinHtmlAttrsMixin      targetblank  models.BooleanField         defaultFalse,         verbosenameOpen in a new window tab,          title  models.CharField         maxlength512,         verbosenameTitle,         blankTrue,           class Meta         abstract  True  class URLMixinmodels.Model      label  models.CharField         maxlength256,         verbosenameName,         blankTrue,          url  models.CharField         maxlength4000,         verbosenameURL,         blankTrue,           class Meta         abstract  True   Concrete model implementing the above mixins class TagLineURLMixin, LinkHtmlAttrsMixin      enabled  models.BooleanFieldenabled, defaultTrue      def unicodeself         return self.label codepre  pThis is working fine so far, but theres a little something i dont quite understand.p  pId like to be able to kind of decide of the inherited fields ordering by simply declaring the mixins in a different order. As far as i know, the default field ordering is based on the order in which those were declared on the model class, and python will resolve attribute names by going through the base classes in the order in which they were listed, so in the above example, id expect the codecssclassescode, codetargetblankcode amp codetitlecode fields to be listed AFTER codelabelcode amp codeurlcode in the admin site, and vice versa if i invert the order of the two mixins in the declaration.p  pBut no matter how i list the mixins, the htmlattrs fields keep appearing first. They are grouped together which seems logical, since they belong to the same class, but i just cant seem to force the ordering in that way.p  pI know this is a trivial question  I can just fix that with an admin fieldset, which will prove much more flexible anyway. It just seemed like a convenient trick which i expected to work, so im simply interested in understanding why it doesnt.p  pAlso, if anyone has any advice about model mixins in general, im all ears  Ive found some info, but not much, and google for codedjango models mixinscode tends to return lots of results about CBV mixins, which is not what im interested in at the moment.p  pThanks to anyone wholl care to answerp

Negative 97 pIm overwhelmed by managing instance variables in controllers so am thinking if theres a better way to manage them. p  pMy situation is, Im having a codePagesControllercode that handles the front page rendering. In the front page, I have multiple small forms that originally belong to different controllers For example, make a new post form, and theres a PostsController dedicated for it but for convenience you can make an easy post just at the front page. and they all need their corresponding instance variable to hold the form e.g. new post form needs a post object.p  pIt turns out to me, that I have to manually add these instance variables into my codePagesControllerindexcode in order to make the forms work, so many lines become justp  precodepost  Post.new  similar for other objects someothervar  OtherController.new  another one onemore  AnotherController.new  again  even more variables here when the website is big codepre  pIf this doesnt seem bad enough, think about when codecreatecode or codeeditcode action fails e.g. does not pass validation and we need to render the previous page. We need to add these lines AGAIN. Actually we need to include ALL THESE VARIABLES whenever theres a render. p  pIt seems very cumbersome to manually type such code to every action that needs them and its so easy to just miss one or two of them when the website gets complicated. p  pSo Im wondering if theres a better way to manage such variables so that we only need to include them once instead of writing the same code every time. p

Negative 97 pI am creating a simple file in python to reorganize some text data I grabbed from a website. I put the data in a .txt file and then want to use the tail command to get rid of the first 5 lines.

However, when I change the name of file2 to bep  precodefile2  teamfnameyear.txt codepre  pI get the error p  psh line 1 2010.txt command not foundp  pIts as if the end of my file2 statement is getting chopped off and the .txt part isnt being recognized. In this case, my code outputs a file but is missing the 2010.txt at the end. Ive double checked that both year and teamfname are strings. Ive also tried it with and without spaces in the teamfname string. I get the same error when I try to include a os.system mv statement that would rename the file to what I want it to be, so there must be something wrong with my understanding of how to specify the string here.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas about what causes this I havent been able to find a solution, but Ive found this problem difficult to search for.p

Negative 97 pI know there are reports of various issues when trying to pull pictures posted by private users. We are working on a project that we want to use the realtime api for. After a private user approves our account, we are able to view images posted by them through the apis as expected.  In addition when searching by tag we see their images.  The realtime API reports the image when we subscribe to the user endpoint.  We want to subscribe to the tag api, the issue is that while everything else works with private users, for some reason when a private user posts an image with a tag for which our client has subscribed, the notification is not set.  It is working fine for public users, and if we search without realtime notification we are able to see the image.   The only thing I can think of is that for search to work we must use our access key for our account not the posters, not our clientid, perhaps realtime needs to use the same security by accesskey rather than client id p

While trying to access admin page, the adminstaticcssbase.css file is used, which is not there it should point to magicalotherlocationcssbase.css so the alias is not picked at all.p  pThen there lies my question  it looks like, the regex for the port proxypass is picked up first  and it shouldnt be, as the docs sayp  precodelocation  images     matches any query beginning with images and halts searching,    so regular expressions will not be checked.

Negative 97 pI am trying to port OpenGL 1.x code a hrefhttpsgithub.combenrichards86Tetris relnofollowherea original code is written by a a hrefhttpsuperuser.comSuper Usera regular, a hrefhttpsuperuser.comusers33595benrichardsBenRichardsa to the WebGLsafe subset of OpenGL 2.x. My plan is to compile the code using a hrefhttpsgithub.comkripkenemscripten relnofollowEmscriptena so that this CSDL app runs as JSWebGL in a modern browser, but to achieve that, I must eliminate the use of the GL 1.x API, since Emscripten is not properly supporting the GL 1.x code that we are using with its imperfectbroken 1.x emulation code. BenRichards is also interested in seeing his newbie GL 1.x code forwardported to a more modern GL API, as long as it runs on both the desktop and in the browser.p  pBoth BenRichards and myself are newish to OpenGL in general, so we have a lot of learning to do in order to understand how to forwardport it. The general approach seems to be to avoid clientside data for performance reasons see a hrefhttpsgithub.comkripkenemscriptenwikiOpenGLsupport relnofollowherea, but I wanted to learn by example.p  pTake this little snippet from a hrefhttpsgithub.combenrichards86TetrisblobmasterTCell.cpp relnofollowherea for examplep  precodevoid TCellOnRender    glPushMatrix   glColor3ubcolor.red, color.green, color.blue    glBeginGLQUADS   glVertex2i20  column  40, 20  row  40   glVertex2i20  column  20, 20  row  40   glVertex2i20  column  20, 20  row  20   glVertex2i20  column  40, 20  row  20   glEnd   ....   glPopMatrix  codepre  pIf someone could write a heavily commented port of this general rendering pattern into WebGLish code still C though, not JavaScript, that would be great. This should provide me a starting point to port the remainder of the app.p  pA good answer to this question will be generally useful beyond the immediate problem I am facing, by explaining the thought process of how to translate this type of immediatemode GL 1.x code into the deferred rendering model of GL 2.x.

Negative 97 pMy wording for this question might not be specific enough, but heres a little more context...p  pWhen looking for a block in cache, the controller selects the set first. Then does it, 1 Test all valid bits in selected set and return a cache miss if any valid bits are not set to 1 or 2 Find the line with a matching tag bit and THEN check the valid bit for just that line.p  pI understand everything else relating to this process. Im just a little confused on what comes first, finding the line or testing valid bits. Thanks in advancep

Negative 97 pI used to think there are only two multithreading hazardsp  ol liemRace conditionem a thread reads codexcode, and before it can write back another thread write codexcode.li liemUnstable stateem a thread writes codexcode and codeycode, but between those two writes another thread reads codexcodes new value and codeycodes old value even though those variables should change together.li ol  pI figured that if I can reason these things cant happen, I dont need to synchronize. But from a hrefhttpforum.dlang.orgthreadfofbrlqruxbevnxchxdpforum.dlang.orgpage3postaikahcfpcfadfjqcsicq40forum.dlang.org relnofollowan argument over the D language forumsa I learned there can be other hazards from how the compiler, the CPU and the memory work behind the scenesp  ol liBoth compiler and CPU can change the order of instruction in a way that does not affect singlethreading execution but can break my reasoning about nonsynchronized thread safety. For example, an object can be allocated and assigned to the threadshared variable and only then the constructor will be called. It shouldnt matter in singlethreading, but with multithreading another thread can now access the uninitialized object.li liCaching means that even if the order of operations is correct, the synching between the global memory and the local caches both threads use can mess with the order one thread can see another threads changes.li liUnaligned pointersized writes are not atomic, and in some architectures even aligned ones might not be atomic, so the pointer itself might be corruptedin unstable state when the other thread reads it, because the thread that written it only written half its bytes.li ol  pI now work on an Android project and once again I face a similar problem  I can reason about some functions being safe from race conditions and unstable states, but not about those three behindthescenes hazards.p  pIve encountered the Java codevolatilecode member fields, and from what I gather it uses memory barriers to prevent the CPU from messing with order of executionand obviously the compiler wont mess with it if it prevents the CPU from doing so so it should solve the first hazard. But what about the other twop  ul liDoes it solve the caching problem Isnt the caching under the responsibility of the OS Does it signal the OS, forcing it to refresh the cacheli liDoes it solve the nonatomicwrites problem Does it force variable alignment and uses the JVMs runtime knowledge to use synchronization when even aligned pointersized writes are not atomicli ul  pIn other words  if I can reason that race conditions and unstable states are not a problem, and mark the shared variable as codevolatilecode, is it safe to not use synchronizationp

Negative 97 pI am new to VBA. This question has been asked and answered a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11429493howtovbachangecellsvaluedisplaytextwithoutchangingitsformulaherea but the answer seems way too hackish. Is there a better way to change the value of a cell without changing the underlying formula in it Ive tried target.textchanged but that gives me an error of Object Requiredp  pThe reason I ask is that in a UDF you can change the display of the cell but the formula remains there.

Negative 97 pMy company operates using public kiosks. These kiosks are running Windows 8 and though they are secure, they are certainly not as secure as the kiosks AKA ATMS you would see at a bank. The reason for running Windows 8 is to take advantage of the new Kiosk feature that Microsoft recently introduced. However, it seems that the OS only allows operation in this KIOSK mode if the software that is being run or intended to be run is available on the Windows Store as an application.p  pThe software required is not able to be put out to the Windows Store at this moment, but Id still like to take advantage of the Kiosk feature. How can I use the kiosk feature and still run the desired application The official MS term for the Kiosk mode is Assigned Access.p  pWe do try to lock down the kiosks as much as possible by giving least permission user access as well as booting the software on startup. In addition, we BitLock whenever possible. However, there is still a delay in booting the software and someone really determined the surf the web could very potentially do so.p  pI am aware that Microsoft had set the Assigned Access rule for a Windows Store app, but I am still looking for any potential workarounds. Even ways to make a Windows Store app really quickly, that is only available for my usage. Third party software is welcome. But any suggestions that can help our case is appreciated.p  pSurely playing around in Active Directory, GPEdit, and Registry will get closer to what I want to achieve. One of the main problems I am facing is that the Windows Desktop amp Metronic UI will load before the application loads, whereas in Kiosk mode a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv1Y7c8oKt0Aosee herea  boot time is quicker.p  pUsers use this launch time for time to check amp time to use attacks. So even with great customization, Im left with the problem that it will never be as efficient as MS could make it. In the end, Id leave that to MS for optimal results.p  pMany people are searching for this answer, Im sure, and any help is appreciated.p  hr  pstrongTLDRstrong How do you use the Windows 8.1 Kiosk feature without having a Windows Store App, but do have softwarep

Negative 97 pI want to move an oracle database from a nonunicode server EL8ISO8859P7 character set and AL16UTF16 NCHAR character set to a unicode server. Specifically to an Oracle Express server with AL32UTF8 character set.p  pSimply exporting exp and importing imp the data fails. We have a lot of the varchar2 columns with their length specified in bytes. When their contents are mapped in unicode  they take more bytes and are truncated.p  pI tried the followingbr  doubling the length of all varchar2 columns of the original database with a script varchar210 becomes varchar220br  exportingbr  importing to the new serverp  pAnd it worked. Apparently doubling is arbitrary, I probably should have changed them to the same size with CHAR semantics.p  pI also tried the followingbr  change all varchar2 columns to nvarchar2 same size  varchar10 becomes nvarchar10br  exportingbr  importing to the new serverp  pIt also worked.p  pSomehow the latter converting to nvarchar seems cleaner. Then again you have a unicode database with unicode data types which seems weird.p  pSo the question is is there a suggested way to go about moving the database between the two servers Is there any serious problem with either of the two approaches I mentioned abovep

Negative 97 pHey so I have this homework assignment and Im having issues with one of the methods. I would like hints and not actual answerscode. p  pSo I have a class called HorseBarn that messes with an array of horseshorse being the type. My problem is Im having troubles with the consolidate method.p  pWhat the array would look like before consolidate a,b,c,d are horsesp  panullbnullcdp  pWhat the array would look like after consolidatep  pabcdnullnullp  pSo my logic would be to make a nested for loop. The first loop would search for a null value, once the first loop finds the null value, the second loop would look for a horse and then swap with it. Then the second loop would end and go back to the first loop. So here is what I have right now and it doesnt workit just terminates. Is my logic wrong or is it my syntax thats causing the problemsp  precodepublic void consolidate      int j  0     forint i  0 i lt spaces.lengthi              if spaces[i]  null                      forj  i j lt spaces.length ampamp spaces[j]  null j                                        spaces[i]  spaces[j]             spaces[j]  null                codepre

Negative 97 pIm working on a bash script that pulls a file from an FTP site only if the timestamp on remote is different than local.

Negative 97 pWhen materializing new aggregate root instances which are constructed from pieces of data that were persisted via entities from a different embounded contextem when transitioning between irreversible states would it be better Domain Driven Design to have this responsibility be of a emRepositoryem or emFactoryem.p  pstrongHome improvement contractor examplestrongp  pSay you have one aggregate root called emProposalem that represents a proposal for some home construction work. In a separate bounded context you have the process in which information from a proposal is allowed to be copied to formulate a new emWorkItemem aggregate root that will track the actual work to be done. p  pWhen formulating the new WorkItem I see at least two possibilities of where to place this responsibilityp  ol liCreate Get a method on emWorkItemRepositoryem which takes a proposal id as an argument and formulates an existing emWorkItemem based on the information from the proposal. The emWorkItemem would probably need to have a status value of some type to indicate whether it is still in the proposal state or not and persisting any emWorkItemem that is still in the proposal state could be blocked by a persistence validation service. Following this approach would be slightly strange since no new work items would ever need to be created in the work items bounded context.li liCreate an interface and concrete class pair for a emWorkItemFactoryem that exposes a method such as emCreateWorkItemFromProposalem that takes a proposal id as an argument that basically does the same thing that the repository Get method would have done. This option uses the typical interfaceimplementation separate similar to that used for repositories where the interface is part of the domain but the concrete implementation is considered infrastructure. This approach seems more flexible in the long term but on the other hand requires separation of contract and implementation for factories which I see more typically for repositories and not Services and Factories in DDD. My typical aggregate root factories do not pull anything out of persistence each time they are invoked, should theyli ol  pFor the sake of the above example it may be useful to assume a scenario that the proposal id remains the same as the later work item id. In other words that the emProposalem and emWorkItemem are different views of the same underlying entity and used in separate domain contexts.p  pOf course I want to also welcome different options that I may have left out in the short list above as long as they are within the general conventions of domain driven design.p

Negative 97 pI developed an app from android using pgs4a. On my galaxy s4 it fits on the screen and works perfectly. On an HTC One M7 however a menu button appears on the bottom of the screen causing the app to not fit on the screen properly. Anyone who has used pgs4a knows that when the app doesnt fit properly on the screen it creates very ugly sidebars. If nobody knows how to get rid of the menu bar it would be helpful if somebody at least knew the exact height of the menu button.p

Negative 97 pOne of the projects Im currently working on includes a Java Swing application for field users to input data about equipment parts scattered all over the companies facilities. Most of the data collected is measured field validation is required or some value the operator can choose from a predefined list.The software then does some calculation and displays back instructions to the operator.p  pso for example for part number 3435AfB, engineering requires the operator to measure  the diameter of some bolt and choose the part maker from a list. the application then compares the measured diameter to the stock diameter and tells the operator if it should be replaced this is obviously not a real world example, but you get the ideap  pThe problem is there are over 200 known equipment parts and these are pretty old and heterogeneous so the engineering team has a limited idea of what they would like to measure on each part in the future. It doesnt seam reasonable to have the development team write and maintain over 200 different classes but doesnt seem realistic to have the engineers use a complicated system of form builders and BPM like drools im getting sweaty just thinking about it.p  pWere currently trying to make a poor mans solution that would allow the engineers to build forms with a simple GUI having limited features and outputting the forms to XML files. The few complicated cases not covered by the GUI solution would be custom made by the developers very few cases. For the calculation part, we would use Java Expression library JEL, the expressions to evaluate would be generated by the same GUI.p  pBefore we commit to this solution, I was wondering if there is something we could do differently to have a more robust system. I know that some people will consider this too much softcoding and I agree that it is going to be difficult extracting and treating the data.p

Negative 97 pI know that to make git check the commit message before committing you can implement codehookscommitmsgcode. But now imagine a case where you want to let the codehooksprecommitcode script behave differently based on the commit messagep  pFor example in a very loose environment you might want to check whether you have a code[nocheck]code tag in your commit message which always lets your commitcheck pass.p  pOr  in a more strict environment  you might want to have every file commented and thus listed separately.p  pOr you might want to check the ticket ID against the related files.p  petc...p  pIs there a way to accomplish this apart from doing the actual check in commitmsg which seems to be counterintuitivep

Negative 97 pI am writing a custom keyboard for iOS 8. My main UIView returns code0, 0, 0, 0code in my codeviewDidLoadcode method. I have tried receiving the CGRect with view.frame and bounds but both return 0. However if I use these same methods to retrieve my views coordinates in the codeviewDidAppearcode method they return fine code0, 0, 320, 216code. The problem here is that viewDidAppear runs after didLoad so I cannot retrieve the size from didAppear and use it in didLoad. Here is my questionp  pWhy does self.view s frame return 0 in codeviewDidLoadcode Shouldnt its size be set already in here This viewDidLoad is where Im supposed to be doing most of my initiation and UI set up, correct I have moderate experience in Xcode.p  pI am programming this in swift, although this shouldnt matter I thought it was worth noting.

Negative 97 pI have no idea what deprecated means in this context. I am new to programming and am making my first couple of apps in Xcode 6. Today I was making a todo list app and when connecting to the scene where the user can input a new todo item to add to main table, I was invited to use a push segue.

Negative 97 pIm working on an ASP.NET application where, as part of some logic, I want to lock some tables and do work on them. The method runs in a separate thread running as a kind of background task, spawned via a Task. The problem comes in with the error handling...p  pThe code looks more or less like thisp  precodeMySqlConnection connection  new MySqlConnectionConfigurationManager.AppSettings[prDatabase] try      connection.Open     MySqlCommand locktables  new MySqlCommandQueries.lockTables, connection     locktables.ExecuteNonQuery       do a bunch of work here      MySqlCommand unlocktables  new MySqlCommandQueries.unlockTables, connection     unlocktables.ExecuteNonQuery  catch MySqlException mex       Mostly error logging here  finally      connection.Close  codepre  pPretty simple stuff. Everything works fine and dandy assuming nothing goes wrong. Thats a terrible assumption to make, though, so I deliberately set up a situation where things would foul up in the middle and move to the finally block.p  pThe result was that my table locks remained until I closed the app, which I learned by trying to access the tables with a different client once the method completed. Needless to say this isnt my intention, especially since theres another app thats supposed to access those tables once Im done with them.p  pI could quickly fix the problem by explicitly releasing the locks before closing the connection, but Im still left curious about some things. Everything Ive read before has sworn that closing a connection should implicitly release the table locks. Obviously in this case it isnt. Why is that Does connection.Close not actually completely close the connection Is there a better way I should be closing my connectionsp

Negative 97 pI have been having an issue resizing some images that are hidden by a closed bootstrap modal. The images are layered on top of each other, so they have to be absolute positioned. I want to correct the size of the image container, so that when the modal is opened they dont look strange.p  pI have a fast resize function, but it will only work once the images are visible. It is used when the user resizes the browser window. Using it for this means that the user sees the nonresized container for a small preiod of time.p  pThe function below is supposed to be run only once when the pages loads and after all the images have finished loading that is working.

Negative 97 pI am developping a firmware on an ARM CORTEX M3 processor, with IAR IDE v6.50. I am wondering the usefullness of the label used for the program entry. I explain.p  pOn the ARM platform, when the chip is reset the PC is loaded with one of the entry of the vector table the second entry in my case. So the program will start from this adress at power time and at every next reset. So the start address depends on what is declared in this entry. But in the IAR options, it is possible to define a label as the program entry. By default, the program entry is iarprogramstart. It is possible to override it. p  pstrongBut if the PC is loaded with the second entry of the vector table on reset, what is the IAR entry point used forstrongp  pI am wondering that question because I am trying to integrate the CMSIS layer in my existing firmware, and the entry point is not iarprogramstart anymore, but ResetHandler. In the IAR option, I first tryed to override the default entry point iarprogramstart by ResetHandler but I had an ielftool error ielftool error The string vectortable was not found in the string table . The solution is to let the default program entry point in the IAR linker option but I cant understand why it souldnt be the ResetHandler label.p  pHeres a part of my startup code for the example its runningp  precode        MODULE  cstartup           Forward declaration of sections.

Negative 97 pJust looking for advice on whats the best way to handle the following scenariop  ol liApplication is broken into different node modules, at startup the application pulls in all modules listed in a require.js fileli liEach module creates its own database and interanlly its own schema i.e projectnamecollege, projectnameauthli lipEach database will have 0N collections inside it, storing data relevant only to its own module i.e. auth will only store user related data, college will only store college preferences etc...BUT will store the IDs of college students as shownp  precodeuserlist [ type Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref User ] codepreli ol  pTo support separation of databases, each module only stores the object ID...all this works but there is a new requirement now to return more detailed information about the user.

The actual problem Its a hardware driver CANUSB and i need to restart my application if the hardware gets disconnected, which is very annoying. If i could load it into an assembly or something like that i could unload respectively reload it. I would need a short and minimalistic, but relating example how to load my dll and how to import and use the dll functions. I attached a screenshot how i am using them right now.p  pWhat I need summarizedp  ol lipExample on how to load a dll of the attached type dynamically and how to use its functions.pli lipHow to unleadreload the dll in case of hardware disconnection.pli ol  pI would appreciate any suggestions.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comom89O.png altdll functionsp  pstrongEDIT 1strong I have now implemented it like it is described in a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combjonathanswiftarchive20061003dynamicallycallinganunmanageddllfrom.net2800c23002900.aspx relnofollowthisa approach but it does strongnotstrong solve my problem.

While .index is called for all the items toplevel, secondlevel children items, thirdlevel grandchildren items and etc. I also do see that both return codeQModelIndexcode with row, column and data variable linked to it. It looks like the QModelIndexes returned by both methods should be in sync.p  pThe code.parentcode returns parent of model item with given index. If item has no parent, an invalid codeQModelIndexcode is returned. A common convention used in models that expose tree data structures is that only items in first column have children. For that case, when reimplementing this function in a subclass the column of the returned codeQModelIndexcode would be 0. When reimplementing this function in a subclass, be careful to avoid calling codeQModelIndexcode member functions, such as codeQModelIndexparentcode, since indexes belonging to your model will simply call your implementation leading to infinite recursion. p  pThe code.indexcode returns the index of the item in the model specified by the given row, column and parent index. When reimplementing this function in a subclass, call codecreateIndexcode to generate model indexes that other components can use to refer to items in your model.p  pIt is worth to mention that both methods use codeself.createIndexrow, column, dataVariablecode method. So they both do the same thing they create QModelIndexes. I just dont understand why we need two methods to do the same thing And it is hard to debug it since it seems they run in infinite loop....p

Negative 97 pI was reading about codeFUNCTIONcode  codefunccode in CC they are used to print the name of the function in which they are used. Every place I read they said that these are macros and are replaced at preprocessing time. So, I investigated this by seeing the preprocessed output using command codegcc E prog.ccode.

Negative 97 pIm making a multiplayer game which involves drawing lines. I have 10 different custom UIViews where I draw an line using Core Graphics in an unique color. All views are stacked upon each other and are semitransparent. The reason why I draw each color in corresponding UIView and not a single one is because I want to let the user be able to clear a specific view. However, If I draw in all of these views the same time, significant amount of lag will occur. If I check the time profiler most of the time is spent on drawing. But its not that bad and should not cause that much lag. So, is there any way to let me draw in multiple UIViews or something else, without causing this lag.

Negative 97 pI have a problem regarding my setup project in Visual Studio.p  pMy application uses a database where user data is kept.

Negative 97 pIm attempting to create a java swing application that runs in fullscreen mode, that can launch powerpoint presentations in fullscreen mode on top in front of my application, and then when they end, return to my application.p  pI build a JFrame and launch it this wayp  precodeGraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment.getDefaultScreenDevice.setFullScreenWindowmyFrame codepre  pTo launch the powerpoint presentation, I have a button that calls an applescript that tells powerpoint to open a presentation file and run it.  That works, but the presentation appears only for a second before the swing application takes over again and shows on the screen.  Further button clicks dont seem to bring the presentation back to the front.p  pThe desired behaviorp  ol liUser clicks on the presentation to open.li liThe presentation opens, on top of the application.  When the end is reached, the presentation exits presentation mode.li liThe presentation has exited, so the swing application is again the foremost fullscreen window.li ol  pId really like to understand what is happening behind the scenes, but its hard to even know what to search for on Google.  If anyone could even point me in the right direction, Id really appreciate it.p  pUPDATE 1p  pAs Im new to this forum, Im following RealSkeptics advice on editing this post with new information instead of adding comments.  I will leave my current comments but will edit going forward.  Anyway, on with the updatep  pI tried switching my swing frame to be maximized and always on top instead of full screen mode. Unfortunately, the always on top setting places it above in front of the PowerPoint presentation in presentation mode.  If I could get this behavior to change, this solution would probably work for me.p  pUPDATE 2p  pI have been thinking about Mac OS Spaces virtual desktops.  Many programs, when putting things into Fullscreen mode through the menus Enter Fullscreen Mode, create a new Space for that window.  Entering mission control will show the normal desktop, plus another Space for the new fullscreen program.  PowerPoint in presentation mode, however, doesnt go into a new Space, it goes over the current desktop.  I have not had a chance to enter mission control with the Swing app in fullscreen mode to see what happens, but will post an update when I do.  p  pIm wondering about potentially trying to get presentations launched from my application to open in a new Space.  I dont yet understand exactly how spaces work in the context of Mac OS windowing systems, but Im hoping that each space could potentially have something in fullscreen, and the newest would always show until closed, at which point the new Space would be destroyed and the normal desktop would be returned to, with the swing application still in fullscreen exclusive mode.p

Negative 97 pI am using MS Visual Studio 2013 to create an Employee Training Program for a client but cannot seem to figure one thing out...p  pThe problem I have is writing any changes from a checkbox matrix back to the relevant table VehicleTrainingMatrixp  pMatrix summary A vehicle manufacture has a range of vehicles and 3 departments of the build, Parts, Construction amp Finishing. before the Matrix is displayed an Employee has been chosen in the program. Bascially each vehicle has a row showing the vehicle name then 3 checkboxes 1 per department and if that Employee has been trained for a particular department for a particular vehicle you enter a Tick in the relevant place. Simple so I thoughtp  pThe datatable was dragged from Data Sources onto the form.p  pIt is based on the following SQL ...p  precode    SELECT V.Vehicle, VTM.PART AS Parts, VTM.CONST as Construction, VTM.FIN AS Finishing FROM VehicleTrainingMatrix AS VTM RIGHT OUTER JOIN  Vehicles AS V ON VTM.VehicleID  V.ID AND VTM.EmployeeID  IDparam ORDER BY V.Vehicle codepre  pIn my program I have the following line to load datap  precodeMe.VehicleTrainingMatrixTableAdapter.FillByIDTrainingDBDataSet.VehicleTrainingMatrix, SelectedEmployeeID codepre  pYou should see the IDparam in the query is satisfied by the supplied SelectedEmployeeID variable.p  pVehicleTrainingMatrix table definitionp  precode    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[VehicleTrainingMatrix] [ID] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL, [EmployeeID] [int] NOT NULL, [VehicleID] [int] NOT NULL, [PART] [bit] NULL, [CONST] [bit] NULL, [FIN] [bit] NULL, PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED  [ID] ASC WITH PADINDEX  OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE  OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS  ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS  ON ON [PRIMARY] ON [PRIMARY] codepre  pBasically any row with a Tick in the matrix relates to one row in the table. The row will have the relevant Employees ID and Vehicle ID stored with a 1 tick in the relevant field PART, CONST or FIN or a combination, 1 row could have all 3 of these ticked.p  pLoading of data works. The problem I have is writing back to the DB any Vehicle Training Matrix changes to the VTM table.p  pI have tried ticking Generate Insert, Update and Delete Statements in Advanced Options of the Table Adapter definition, but this does not happen. When you go back into the definition they are greyed out again. I have looked into this and I believe correct me if I am wrong it is because I have more than 1 table listed in my select query. Another point is I do not really think I need the VehicleTrainingMatrix.ID field, I only added it when trying to get around this cannot write back to DB issue I have been trying to sort this for a couple of days now where one post seemed to indicate I needed a Primary Key to do it.p  pI have manually added the following into SQLp  precodeINSERT INTO [dbo].[VehicleTrainingMatrix]        [EmployeeID]        ,[VehicleID]        ,[PART]        ,[CONST]        ,[FIN]  VALUES        621, 2, 1, NULL ,NULL codepre  p621  Employee ID,p  p2  The Vehicles ID valuep  p1  That employee is trained in the Parts Department for Vehicle with ID 2p  pNULL  That employee is NOT trained in the Construction Department for Vehicle with ID 2p  pNULL  That employee is NOT trained in the Construction Department for Vehicle with ID 2p  pHopefully the above has all the details required but to summarize The Datatable reads from the DB and populates the Matrix perfectly. My problem is how can I get any changes to the Matrix new ticks only I will be disabling the ability to untick, not quite sure how yet though. A change could involve having to create a new row in Table VehicleTrainingMatrix if an unticked row has a tick put in it or just updating an existing row.p  pSo you know my level I am just getting back into programming after quite a few years just doing support and have basically taught myself .net please dont respond with C examples and VS 2014. I have had a huge learning curve but was doing really well up to this problem. Certain terminology may be lost on me so I would appreciate explantions rather than possible a short to the point answer.p  pMany thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help.p  pPaul.p

Negative 97 pIm trying to port some older GSL code to using the header only Eigen library.  Im doing this as a side job for some data scientists and as such my math has lapsed a little since college.

It looks like a leastsquares curve fitting function.p  pIf there is a way of directly converting that, what would it bep  pIf not, is there another library I can use  Keep in mind here that it must not have a GPL or similar share all code license.  MIT or BSD is preferred, LGPL and MozillaApache are ok too.p  pThanks.p

Negative 97 pI am trying to use Intel TBB parallelreduce to compute the best response to a user move in a Connect 4 game. I wrote a simple function that when passed a column number returns a heuristic score corresponding to the utility of playing that move. My intent is to call this function in parallel and then return the reduction of the returned results. The reduction will be the move with the highest heuristic score.p  pHowever I find that I get inconsistent results. I expect the move for column 0 to be returned from the parallel reduce as I have written the heuristic score function such that it returns 7  column number as the score. p  pI have attached the C code. Here is a sample output that it producesp  blockquote   pReturn move 0p      pReturn move 1p      pReturn move 2p      pReturn move 6p      pReturn move 4p      pReturn move 5p      pCompare moves 5Return move 3 amp 6p      pCompare moves 3 amp 4p      pCompare moves 3 amp 5p      pCompare moves 2 amp 3p      pBest move is 2p blockquote  pI have looked at the code many many times and am at loss to understand why it does not always return 0 as the best move. It sometimes does return zero, but not always. As you can see above, move 0 is evaluated, but the reduction lambda function never gets it as an input. Any help will be greatly appreciated. I have a vague suspicion that the identity of 0 that I have used, may not be right.

Negative 97 pIm trying to populate a listview based on a conditional query of a table.  Something to the effect of codeSELECT  FROM MESSAGETABLE WHERE LAT  AND LNG code  This, in theory, should return the messages with a latitude and longitude equal to the users input and I think should return messages specific to a given location my logic on this one might be wrong but I can cross that bridge when I come to itp  pIve constructed the query getLLMessages in a database adapter MessageDAO using a similar format to the getMessages method for getting all messages which works fine.

Negative 97 pI have my app in the App Store, currently as a paid version, but I am making this free and bringing IAPs which unlocks some features that they had previously. For example, Free users can add only 10 entries, but IAP users can add any amount in this version that Im developing, but on the current App Store version, they could add any amount.p  pIf a user is upgrading from the version in the App Store to the version Im bringing now, I immediately set a NSUserDefault IAPSuccessful to YES, so that the user has unlocked all of the features because theyve already purchased it. p  pHowever, if the user deletes the app and reinstalls it and clicks on the Restore button, theres nothing for them to actually restore. p  pHow would I go about fixing this I want to make sure the user has all of the features when they upgrade, but how do I assign the purchase to their account, so that they can restore from another device or if the app is deletedp  pTo clarify, if the user is on the current version 2.2 and they upgrade, they unlock all of the features of the IAP and are now on the Pro version based on the NSUserDefaults, but if they uninstall the app and reinstall it and then click on Restore, theres nothing for them to restore because theres no receipt on their account, like there would be if they were a new user and they made an IAP. How do I fix thisp  pIm thinking I need to invoke a purchase when the update completes, but then not charge the user. p  pIn the update, I have a small image showing with a codeUIButtoncode that just gives an indication to the updating user what the new features are. When the user clicks the codeUIButtoncode in that Image, it sets the codeNSUserDefaultscode for codeIAPSuccessfulcode to YES, so that they are on the Pro version straight away. Its not however setting an active purchasereceipt to the users iTunes account. p  pI have just tried to call the codemakePurchasecode method in my codeIAPViewControllercode, but nothing is happening. p

Negative 97 pEverything was working fine in my ASP.Net MVC5 EF6 project until I had database issues. The only way I found to resolve them was by deleting my database and migrations folder.

Only my models changed and my Migrations folder.p  pI am definetly missing something here and I would really like some help to understand EF6 better.

Negative 97 pAhoy...p  pIm doing an Ember application, and I need to be able to scale the layout, as it sometimes needs to be displayed on large panels, where I cant get the pixel ratio. oh, emandem all the way down to iPhone screens as well...p  pSo, heres my problem Ive made the whole thing totally scalable and dandy, but I emdoem also need to use a bunch of media queries here and there.p  pNow, while I can scale the application fonts etc. up and down with my JS skillz, the general layout remains the same, as the media queries are unchanged. This obviously makes everything look somewhat distorted.p  pWhat I need is basically to be able to apply a scaling factor to the limits in my media queries.p  pI realise that a workaround would be to change the meta tag for the screen width, but thats a nogo, as we need device pixel  actual pixel for the cleanest rendering many Androids look fuzzy with pixel ratio e.g. 1.75.p  pIve looked at using calc.. in the media queries doesnt work. As Im using Ember, I have access to all the templates and stuff. Im thinking along the lines of calculating it all in JS and shoving it into the DOM in a STYLE tag, but with 100 media queries, I imagine it will get painful... And keep me from lager in the weekend... So heres me drafting... No pun intended...p  pEDITp  pSeems I havent stressed a key issue enough The MQs need to be changeable clientside. As mentioned, the application needs to run on wallmount TV screens of arbitrary size, so while they probably all have HD or HDready resolution, the PPI varies a lot, and the only way to obtain the appropriate scale of the design, is to fire the thing up and scale it to fit in the app config. Just going with plain ol MQs wont cut it.p

Negative 97 phow do the RSbuddy client work It seems to have great access to the runescape.. Im more than sure that it can be done with not working closely with the developers, but might be bannable, but that doesnt matter. And can it be done by accessing only memory from runescape clients process It seems to know what mobs im fighting etc. Do you think it can be done with c or only javap

Negative 97 pI am creating an Angular application, and I am having trouble wrapping my head around the proper way to ensure my application and its users is secure.p  pIve been reading around many stack discussions, but I believe I am missing some core understanding of what is happening, please correct any errors you see written below.p  pSo far I have a Sinatra server with many currently mostly hypothetical resource routes.  A user can create an account using an email address and password that is stored in a database after being hashed with BCrypt.  When a user logs in, the record is retrieved from the database by email and the password checked for authentication.  It is from this point I am not sure how to proceed.p  pPrior to this I have simply set a session variable and had the server check that the variable exists in order to correctly route logged in users.  Now my application is currently a single HTML page that uses Angular and uirouter to display different content, so most of the requests are simply returning JSON content.p  pIt is my understanding that Restful applications should generally not use sessions, or rather that the server should respond identically to identical requests and not have its own data that shapes a response. strongBut if I do not store something in a session variable, how could the server know that the client making the request has the correct permissionsstrong And are sessions not stored in the browser anyway, thus not part of the serverp  pI believe from what I have read, it is possible to create a token which is essentially a large random string, return that string to the client and also store it in a database with a timestamp. The client then provides this token when making requests and the server hits the database to verify it exists and valid. But would the client not also have to store that string in a cookie  I suppose the angular application could store the token in a variable, which would persist while using the uirouter but not if the users navigates using the address bar.p  pI also do not understand how Basic Auth may or may not fit into this picture. Any help would be greatly appreciated, as well as a pointer to some good resources where I may find a better understanding of these concepts in general.p

Negative 97 pHow would you go about sending a command via SSHp  precodessh userserver t codepre  pWhich will create a tmux session, send commands to it and then attach  allowing you to manually work on the interactivity presented from the commands This has to be done while at the same time logging in as root  NOT via sudo.p  precodessh userserver t bash c su  c tmux d  aptget update  aptget upgrade root codepre  por simply without bash c which was an attempt at getting SSH to show the tmux window  as it when using su  instead of sudo would not display the shell.

Negative 97 pIm fairly new to Durandal, Knockout and Requirejs, so I wanted to ask some opinions whether my structure makes sense or notp  pIve been planning to create models for my data objects, like classes in classbased languages. therefore i would be creating a folder codemodelscode in which Id define modules like codestudentcode transient, holds one students data and codestudentscode singleton, holding array of student objects and functions for adding, removing, etc.p  pThese modules I would then require in my ViewModels e.g. adminstudents for the administration area, userstudent where the data for one student is loaded... etc...p  pDoes this make sense or would it be better to just put everything into one module and define students and student in every viewModel Im a little lost on how to leverage reusable code here.p

Negative 97 pIm using scikitlearn and numpy and I want to set the global seed so that my work is reproducible.p  pShould I use codenumpy.random.seedcode or coderandom.seedcodep  pstrongEditstrong From the link in the comments, I understand that they are different, and that the numpy version is not threadsafe. I want to know specifically which one to use to create IPython notebooks for data analysis. Some of the algorithms from scikitlearn involve generating random numbers, and I want to be sure that the notebook shows the same results on every run.p
Negative 97 pI have a Swift  ObjectiveCC project, everything worked fine, until I added CoreData, now every time I modify something, it throws an errorp  blockquote   p...DerivedData...Intermediates.buildDebugiphonesimulator.buildDerivedSourcesSwift.h13626 Cannot find interface declaration for NSManagedObject, superclass of  did you mean NSManagedObjectModelp blockquote  pand p  blockquote   p...DerivedData...Intermediates.buildDebugiphonesimulator.buildDerivedSourcesSwift.h13626 Attempting to use the forward class NSManagedObjectModel as superclass of p blockquote  pOf course, is not the real problem, I already tried to delete everything on DerivedData, and the problem persists.p  pThe fix, is adding in the headers of the Swift.h file, import , and then the errors are gone. Until I modify my code.p  pAnyone knows a real solution for this its kind of annoying to have to include that lib every time I compile. p  pXcode version is Version 6.3.2 6D2105p  pEdit The problem occurs in the Swift.h file, which is created by Xcode...p  pstrongEdit2 I had to rewrite an entire class to avoid using ObjectiveC Except for third party libraries and the problem is gone, so I think its related to how ObjectiveC tries to handle Swiftbased core data classes.strong p  pNow I dont have the problem, but could help someone somedayp
Negative 97 pI have collections codeProjectcode, codeGroupcode, and codeItemcode. An item belongs to a group and a group belongs to a project.p  pThe items are often updated, so they have to be in a separate collection but the groups are almost always created with the project. So I wonder if its better to create a project schema which looks something likep  precodeProject      id String,     name String,     groups                       id String,             totalamount Number              ,     totalamount Number  codepre  pBut I need to print totalamount both on the project and in each group. I guess it is not possible to use annotated querysets to create these sums since MongoDB does not support relational schemas. So I guess I have to update the codetotalamountcode field every time the codeamountcode field in a codeItemcode document is updated.p  pHow can I make sure the codetotalamountcode in codeProjectcode and codeGroupcode is updated to reflect the total sum of the amounts in the items which belong to those projectsgroups Will the proposed schema above fit my needs I dont think its a big problem to imitate a relational schema using codeItem.groupIdcode and codeGroup.projectIdcode but Im not sure what to do about the totals.p  h1Edith1  pI could also create a template helper which loops through the children and sum the total. But I guess its quite memory consuming to loop through all objects every time the page is loaded.p

Negative 97 pI have looked long and hard for a working answer to this problem and it seems either Im working around a bug in the Design library, or there isnt an answer to what I want to do.p  pI have a CollapsingToolbar with Parallax Image and a ViewPager below. The ViewPager will only act on horizontal scrolls, while the dark box at the bottom is a TextView which will do vertical scrolls and collapse the Toolbar.p  pMy solution now isnt great for several reasons  Heres a a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvfRGIVrwKLx8 relnofollowVIDEOa to show why.p  ol lipOn API22 and presumably 21, my TitleBar has a shadow under it, which breaks the continuity with the TabLayout below.pli lipMy ViewPager can only page horizontally. It needs to also accept vertical input and collapse the Toolbar.pli lipI have a TextView which pages vertically, collapsing the ToolBar.

Basically I have a custom searchview outside of the actionbar which searches within a recylerview list.

The xml code is as below, any further code can be posted on request.p  pEDIT using adjustResize in manifest solves the problem of hidden Actionbar but leaves a whitespace one fourth the size of the screen once the keyboard is discarded.

Negative 97 pFirst of all, sorry for the longish question.p  pIm using D2RQ to map a relational SQL database to RDF. Im, however, running into some issues now when calculating the value for a property using D2RQs sqlExpression property. Let me first provide you with an overview of the background.p  h2Backgroundh2  pAmong the tables in my SQL database are a codeconceptcode table and a codeStatementcode table. Rows in the concept table are uniquely identified by a concept identifier codeCUIcode whereas each row in the statement table represent a statement that relates two concepts a source, identified by codescuicode, and an object, identified by codeocuicode through a codepredicatecode and is uniquely identified by a codestatementidcode. p  h2Goalh2  pDuring the mapping I am creating a concept instance for every row in the concept table. Additionally, I want to compute the indegree and outdegree of each concept e.g. the number of incoming and outgoing edges to  from a concept respectively during the mapping. Given the fact that statements are located in the statements table, this could be achieved by the following SQL queryp  precodeSELECT COUNTDISTINCT statementid  FROM statements  WHERE ocui  CUI of a particular concept codepre  pIn this query codeocuicode is used when calculating the indegree and codescuicode is used when calculating the outdegree of a concept. Running this query in MySQL gives be the actual in and outdegree of the concepts. p  h2D2RQh2  pSo, this is where D2RQ comes into play. Considering that I want to convert the SQL into RDF, I used D2RQs a hrefhttpd2rq.orgd2rqlanguagepropertybridgeproperties relnofollowcodesqlExpressioncodea property which allows one to specify a SQL query that is evaluated on runtime to a datatype value by querying the database. To this extent I converted the SQL query into the following expression p  precoded2rqsqlExpression SELECT COUNTDISTINCT statementid                      FROM statements                      WHERE ocui  CONCEPTS.CUI codepre  pAccording to the a hrefhttpd2rq.orgd2rqlanguageresourceidentity relnofollowD2RQ documentationa, codeCONCEPTS.CUIcode serves as a placeholder for the identifier of the concept that is being mapped, and thus should be replaced by the appropriate CUI when evaluated. The placeholder is encapsulated in quotes because the database values for codeCUIcodes are strings, and quotes thus are required by MySQL. p  h2Problemh2  pWhen running the dump through codedumprdfcode or starting the server through coded2rservercode, all concepts get an in and outdegree of code0code, which, obviously, is incorrect.  p  pInitially I thought that this was because of the fact that the placeholder is enclosed in quotes, though when removing the quotes, D2Rserver throws an codeUnknown System Variable CUIcode error, because global variables in SQL are indicated by codecode. Leaving out the codeWHEREcode clause provides me with an integer namely the number of items in the codestatementscode table, so I assume the issue is in the codeWHEREcode clause, and more specifically in the placeholder. p  pMy guess is that it doesnt get replaced with the appropriate codeCUIcode on runtime. Escaping the quotes doesnt work either and still returns in and outdegrees of code0code. p  pDo you guys have any clue how to resolve this issue such that the placeholder is appropriately replaced during runtime and the SQL query provides the appropriate in and outdegree countsp

Negative 97 pIm looking for an established security mechanism to apply client side password hashing in addition to server side password hashing. The client is either a web app or a mobile app. The communication between client and server uses HTTPS. The server should use bcrypt or a similarly secure password hashing algorithm.p  pNow, I dont want to send the unencrypted password from the client to the server in order to prevent insider attacks against the user. I want to make sure that none of our admins is able to get the original password, since  as we all know  most people reuse their password on multiple web sites or use a password scheme to derive passwords that are easy to remember.p  pAdditionally, I would like to implement an additional twofactorlayer of security into the authentication protocol that makes use of a secret stored on the client in order to strengthen the overall security even more.p  pAre there any published and validated mechanisms that can be used for this situationp  pstrongEDITstrong In my scenario, evil admins cannot control the code of the app. The server that is doing the authentication and that provides sensitive data is a REST server. The application code is delivered by a different server for the web app or via the AppStore for the mobile app. And I am also thinking about scenarios where an attacker has only readonly access to an internal network segment that connects the HTTPS server with the application server. In most real world setups, SSL termination is done on a dedicated server.p

Negative 97 pI have an image in which every pixel is a random combination of maximum and minimum RGB values i.e. [255, 0, 255], [0, 0, 255], [255,255,255].p  pHowever, the image does contain some text that is hidden as a very slight, imperceptible discoloration in the noise. I am trying to write some simple Python to whiten all pixels containing maximum or minimum RGB values so that the hidden message will be clearly visible.p  pThe program should be extremely simple, something like thisp  precodeopen image get width and height for x in width    for y in height        if any channel value of pixel x,y is either 0 or 255           set color of x,y to [255, 255, 255] codepre  pThe main part Im stuck on is the condition for changing the color I could separately check first the red value of each pixel, then green, then blue, but since I am trying to make the code as compact as possible, I would like to know how to test all three elements in the array simultaneously rather than using separate if statements.  Any hints would be appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 97 pThe a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.passwordbox.password28vvs.11029.aspxf255ampMSPPError2147217396 relnofollowmsdn documentationa on codePasswordBox.Passwordcode saysp  blockquote   pWhen you get the Password property value, you expose the password as plain text in memory. To avoid this potential security risk, use the SecurePassword property to get the password as a SecureString.p blockquote  pSo I send codeSecurePasswordcode to my view model on codePasswordChangedcode event, expecting everything to be secure, but if I inspect my application with Snoop, in PasswordBoxs codePasswordcode property I see the password I entered in plain text. Does that not kill the whole purpose of using SecurePassword Is there anything else I should do here to protect the passwordsp
