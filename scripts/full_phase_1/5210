Positive 5210 pWhat status code is more appropriate for a case when relation is not existingp  pFor instance, codearticles1comments4code, with this call you will get codecommentIDcode 4 from codearticleIDcode 1. But what if codecommentIDcode 4 not exists in this relation, what should API returned, code404code or code200code  p  pstrongEDITstrong Let me clarify what do I meant.p  pThe thing is, you can interpret code404code like resource not exists from another point of view, for instance codearticles1builders3code. You dont have such route at all in your application Your application does have handler for such url completely. But codearticles1comments4code. You have such route in app, you have handler controller. And yeah, I know that this url reflect relationship between comments and articles, and this is why it is tricky. Because comment with codeIDcode 4 might exists in your codeDBcode even if it does not belong to article. Then if you have such route in application you may say that from http protocol point of view you have such resource, but based on your application logic, you may say that such comment not belongs to specified article. p

Positive 5210 pIs an HTTP 501 error appropriate for functionality which the server plans to support, but does not currently, such as a particular case of an API For instance, if I was designing a webmail app and I couldnt yet delete emails with attachments, would it be appropriate to give 501 if I got a DELETE request on an email with an attachmentp  pThe RFC says that it should be used for an unknown method e.g. a PARTY request, but its not clear whether it should be used for other functionality as well.p

Positive 5210 pI have an app that has a Service that offloads photos that people are taking to the server. p  pSpecifically, users are sent to the devices native camera to take a photo and then the photo is returned via intent to the app from which they approve it. p  pThis act of approval saves it out to the file system and the Service comes along every x seconds, notices files awaiting offload and offloads them.p  pThis all works fine.p  pHowever... in situations where there is bad connectivity but enough for the HTTP handshake, the app finds itself in a state where even though the offload is happening in a Service, at the point where the user is coming back to my app from the photo taking and Android is delivering the 48mb photo back to my approval Activity, my app hangs  sometimes long enough to provoke the do you want to kill or wait prompt.  Eventually if you wait it does succeed in making its way back to the app.p  pIve verified that this is Network related because when the connectivity is strong or when the app is in airplane mode  so the upload just fails instantly everything works perfectly smoothly.  The only time this happens is when the offloader in the Service is hampered by a hinky connection.p  pSo, my question is  what can I do about this  Is there some way I can isolate the Service to not have a larger effect on the app Is my solution to write a partner app that sits on the device and just looks to offload the files would that even solve the problem. p  pa hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsly5pfu5n0v7vgvlanr20log201.txtdl0 relnofollowHEREa is the report Im getting when the WAITKILL prompt is offered to the user.

The project i chose, is to automate some internal websites. These websites use cookies, authentication, sessions and chained calls 302. p  pI wrote this codep  precodeimport urllib, urllib2, cookielib  cj  cookielib.CookieJar myurl  httpstest.company.com opener  urllib2.buildresponse urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessorcj resp  opener.openmyurl  print resp.read codepre  pNow its doing what it is suppose to do but since i am learning there are few things that i need to get conrol ofp  ol liI dont want to do the chain redirects if its 302. I want to do it manuallyli liI want to extract the sessions so that with every request which i will be doing with 302 location header, I can add that sessioncookieli liany tutorial which helps me understand python and http will be appreciated. I am already taking course at codecademy.comli ol
Positive 5210 pIn my app I am making http get and http post requests and after about making like 4050 requests I get the following error exception. It looks like the http connection is keeping too many files open even after making the calls. I have added the HTTP Async handlers and their usages at the bottom. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.

Positive 5210 pSo as I understood if you change URL of something in Magento, an entry in codecoreurlrewritecode table is created which redirects new url to previous url. Each time the URL is changed, rewrites are appended, not replaced. If URL of something is changed 100 times, there will be 100 chained rewrites in codecoreurlrewritecode. p  pFirst of all correct me if Im wrong please. Secondly, what problems would there be if all links in the middle of all redirect chains were removed, leaving only the first link and the last link Has anyone done it, was it worth it, were you using any existing scripts and what were the resultsp

Positive 5210 pI have a C desktop application, which needs to make multiple simultaneous http requests to the same web server. Heres the test I performed to check whether my requests actually do happen simultaneouslyp  ol lipOn the web server, created a test page that sleeps for 3 seconds simulates some longrunning task, then returns current datetime. Heres the code VB.Netp  pltsystem.threading.thread.sleep3000ltnow pli lipIn the C app, I have a function MakeRequest which uses System.Net.Http.HttpClient to make a web request, and returns the response as string.pli lipThen in the C app theres a function invoked by a button click, that calls MakeRequest multiple times asynchronouslyp  pvar responses  await Task.WhenAllMakeRequest, MakeRequest, MakeRequest pli ol  pIn the above example, MakeRequest is called 3 times. What I see on the web server when I monitor the Requestssec performance counter, is that it gets 2 requests, and then 3 sec later 1 more request. Thats by design, because the default value for System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit is 2, so my C app can only send 2 requests at a time, though I asked for 3. Overall time the C app took to complete the button click was 6 sec.p  pNow in the C app, I set ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit  1000000. This time Requestssec on the web server shows 3, and the button click in the C app completes in 3 seconds. All good so far.p  pNext I change the C app to make 60 simultaneous calls rather than 3. Thats where things get interesting. When I click the button, I expect to see Requestssec on the web server to spike to 60, and the C app to complete the button click in 3 sec. What I get instead is web server Requestssec showing something like 5, after 3 seconds 5 more, etc., until all 60 requests have been made. When I click the button again, the same picture except for Requestssec spike to 10 or 15, and the button click obviously completes faster. Click again  this time Requestssec show two spikes to 30, and the button click completes in 6 sec. Subsequent button clicks result in the Requestssec spiking first to 40 then to 20 for the total of 60 requests, then 50 and 10, then maybe 55 and 5, and eventually my C app starts sending all 60 requests in one go. The button click completes in 3 sec, and Requestssec on the web server shows one spike to 60. If I continue pushing the button, I consistently get all 60 requests being made simultaneously.p  pBut thats not all. If I stop pushing the button, my C app seems to forget its previous achievement. I do not restart the app, just stop pushing the button for a minute, and on the next push I go back to 5 requests at a time, and the above scenario would repeat if I keep pushing the button continuously.p  pI also performed the above test from MVC  just copied and pasted the code from the C app to a MVC page. Got exactly the same result.p  pCan anyone please explain whats going on Thank youp

Negative 5210 pAs someone in the world of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHighperformancecomputingHPCa who came from the world of enterprise web development, Im always curious to see how developers back in the real world are taking advantage of parallel computing.

Negative 5210 pI have a clientserver architecture in my application that uses SSL.  Currently, the private key is stored in CAPIs key store location.  For security reasons, Id like to store the key in a safer place, ideally a hardware signing module HSM that is built for this purpose.  Unfortunately, with the private key stored on such a device, I cant figure out how to use it in my application.p  pOn the server, I am simply using the codeSslStreamcode class and the codeAuthenticateAsServer...code call.  This method takes an codeX509Certificatecode object that has its private key loaded, but since the private key is stored in a secure e.g. non exportable location on the HSM, I dont know how to do this.p  pOn the client, I am using an codeHttpWebRequestcode object and then using the codeClientCertificatescode property to add my client authentication certificate, but I have the same problem here how do I get the private keyp  pI know there are some HSMs that act as SSL accelerators but I dont really need an accelerator.  Also, these products tend to have special integration with web servers such as IIS and Apache which Im not using.p  pAny ideas  The only thing I can think of would be to write my own SSL library that would allow me to hand off the signing portion of the transaction to the HSM, but this seems like a huge amount of work.p

Negative 5210 pIn order to make a binary comparer Im trying to read in the binary contents of two files using the CreateFileW function.

Negative 5210 pIm just getting started with Cucumber and Webrat, and am adding feature specifications to an existing Rails application.  One page in the app has multiple forms on it, representing different ways to build a new Character object.  Heres a simplified examplep  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltform idadoptcharacterformgt     ....     ltinput typetext namecharacter[name] idcharacternamegt     ... ltformgt  ltform idspawncharacterformgt     ....     ltinput typetext namecharacter[name] idcharacternamegt     ... ltformgt codepre  pAs you can see, there are at least two fields that have the same name and id on the page, though they are in different forms, and I cant find a way in the Webrat rdoc or source code to specify a particular one.p  pI know that I could change the name or id on one of them, but I would have to deviate from the Rails naming conventions to do so, which Id really rather not.  I could also put the forms on different pages, but it would take more modification to the work flow than I want to do.  I could also try to merge them in to a single form that was more modular and dynamic, but having to make structural changes to the UI just to support a given testing framework seems a little questionable and might not always be feasible, plus I would have to require javascript.p  pIs there any way to specify one of these fields in Webrat, or should I just give up and try Cucumber on a different projectp

Negative 5210 pI have read a lot of articles about whether we should have primary keys that are identity columns, but Im still confused.p  pThere are advantages of making columns are identity as it would give better performance in joins and provides data consistency. But there is a major drawback associated with identity ,i.e.When INSERT statement fails, still the IDENTITY value increases If a transaction is rolled back, the new IDENTITY column value isnt rolled back, so we end up with gaps in sequencing. I can use GUIDs by using NEWSEQUENTIALID but it reduces performance.p

What do you preferp  pI made a pic to make my question clearer.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comr8I3d.png altSingle or multiple tablesp  pWhy am I even thinking of this Isnt one table the most obvious option Well, kind of. Its the simpliest way, but lets think more practical. When there is a ton of data in one table and user wants to only see statistics about browsers the visitors use, this may not be as successful. Taking browserdata out of one table is naturally better.p  pMultiple tables has disadvantages too. Writing data takes more time and resources. With one table theres only one mysqlquery needed.p  pAnyway, I figured out a solution, which I think makes sense. Data is written to some kind of temporary table. All of those lines will be exported to multiple tables later scheduled script. This way the system doesnt take loadingtime from the users page, but the data remains fast to browse.p  pLets bring some discussion here. Hopefully Stackoverflow staff doesnt delete my question, as there may not be only one right answer. Im hoping to raise some opinions.p  pWhich one is better Lets find outp  pMartti Lainep

Negative 5210 pI have a MySQL DB and I need to be able to store dates earlier then 1970 so I need a custom way to store dates. In my case, I need to be able to store dates up to the present and as far back as history goes. Obviously earlier events in history require less accuracy  days, months, even years become less important, as we do not have this historical information. The main query involving dates will be to select records between two given dates. p  pI have thought to use this format  p  pcodeYear  int6  Month  tinyint2  day  tinyint 2  time  time  AD tinyint 1  mya  int 11codebr But when it comes to actually using data in this format it becomes difficult. For example, if I want to get all records between two dates it would be like pseudocode not SQL  p  pcodeget all where year between minYear and maxYearbr if year  minYear, month  minMonthbr if year  maxYear, month lt maxMonthbr if month  minMonth, day  minDaybr if month  maxMonth, day lt maxDaybr if day  minDay, time  minTimebr if day  maxDay, time lt maxTimecode  p  por something, which seems like a right pain.

Negative 5210 pIm working on an addin for Visual Studio 2008 and want to add a permanent submenu to contain my contextsensitive commands to several context menus such as Project, Item, ....p  pI have had no problem adding this submenu to the top of the context menu or to the bottom of it.

For some context menus it works fine, for others it creates my submenu at the wrong place Im pretty sure I find the right index for insertion....p  pIs there a proper way of doing thisp

Negative 5210 pIm trying to write a crossplatform program in c that will load certain modules shared libraries at runtime. To do this Im using the ClassLoader from a hrefhttpwww.pocoproject.org relnofollowPoco C Librariesa. Ive written a compiling chain using autoconf, automake and libtool. This shouldnt be any problem in a Linux environment, but the problem occurs in Windows. Im using MinGW and MSYS when compiling to be able to make use of my Makefiles. ClassLoader uses the Windowsspecific LoadLibrary function to load the modules, which means I have to compile them as DLLs.p  pThe class that I compile to a library inherits another class within the main application. Then when I try to run make, it complains a lot about undefined reference and refuses to build a shared library. I guess this is because of the name mangling. Or is it because I cant inherit a class outside of the library That class is not included in the sources for the library, but the header file is foundp  pIm not really sure how much trouble its going to bring that I insist on compiling under MinGW  MSYS but still make use of LoadLibrary. Anyone with experience of thisp
Negative 5210 pI want to read a source code HTML tags of a given URL from my servlet.p  pFor example, URL is a hrefhttpwww.google.com relnofollowhttpwww.google.coma and my servlet needs to read the HTML source code.  Why I need this is, my web application is going to read other web pages and get useful content and do something with it.p  pLets say, my application shows a shop list of one category in a city. How that list is generated is, my web application servlet goes through a given web page which is displaying various shops and read content. With the source code my servlet filters that source and get useful details. Finally creates the list because my servlet has no access to the given URLs web applications database.p  pAny know any solution specially I need this to do in servlets If do you think that there is another best way to get details from another site, please let me know.p  pThank youp

Negative 5210 pActually I am having several questions related to the subject given in the topic title.p  pI am already using Perlin functions to create lightning in my application, but I am not totally happy about my implementation.p  pThe following questions are based on the initial and the improved Perlin noise implementations.p  pTo simplify the issue, lets assume I am creating a simple 2D lightning by modulating the height of a horizontal line consisting of N nodes at these nodes using a 1D Perlin function.p  ol lipAs far as I have understood, two subsequent values passed to the Perlin function must differ by at least one, or the resulting two values will be identical. That is because with the simple Perlin implementation, the Random function works with an int argument, and in the improved implementation values are mapped to [0..255] and are then used as index into an array containing the values [0..255] in a random distribution. Is that rightpli lipHow do I achieve that the first and the last offset value i.e. for nodes 0 and N1 returned by the Perlin function is always 0 zero Right now I am modulation a sine function 0 .. Pi with my Perlin function to achieve that, but thats not really what I want. Just setting them to zero is not what I want, since I want a nice lightning path wo jaggies at its ends.pli lipHow do I vary the Perlin function so that I would get two different paths I could use as animation start and end frames for the lightning I could of course add a fixed random offset per path calculation to each node value, or use a differently setup permutation table for improved Perlin noise, but are there better optionspli ol

Negative 5210 pI am building a map system that requires a large image native 13K pixels wide by 20K pixels tall to be overlayed onto an area of the US covering about 20 kilometers or so. I have the file size of the image in jpg format down to 23 MB and it loads onto the map fairly quickly. I can zoom in and out and it looks great. Its even located exactly where I need it to be geographically. However, that 25 MB file is causing Firefox to consume an additional 1GB of memory I am using Memory Restart extension on Firefox and without the image overlay, the memory usage is about 360 MB to 400 MB, which seems to be about the norm for regular usage, browsing other websites etc. But when I add the image layer, the memory usage jumps to 1.4 GB. Im at a complete loss to explain WHY that is and how to fix it. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.p  pAndrewp

Negative 5210 pIve been working to get a windows service to automatically restart an app when there is a new version. My code is below, and it actually works. My question is this Is there a big nono in here somewhere Im new to creating app domains on separate threads, and Id like to know if there is a more elegant way to accomplish this. Im also concerned that maybe I have a big blind spot regarding how Im handling this. Any advice is appreciated.p  pThere are two general pieces the Windows service that runs, starts my app in a different process, then polls to detect when a new version of that app is available. The second piece is the actual app that gets started, updated, restarted.p  pFirst, when the service starts, it calls LoadApp so that the app starts running.    p  precodeprivate void LoadApp            appDomainSetup here       this.appDomain  AppDomain.CreateDomainMyUpdatedApp, AppDomain.CurrentDomain.Evidence, appDomainSetup      this.tokenSource  new CancellationTokenSource      Task.Factory.StartNew gt              try                      this.appDomain.ExecuteAssemblyassembly                  catch AppDomainUnloadedException ex                      Debug.WriteLineex.ToString              , tokenSource.Token  codepre  pThen, every 10 seconds, the timer calls this methodp  precodeprivate void Processobject stateInfo      if Monitor.TryEnterlocker  return       try               Check for new binaries. If new, copy the files and restart the app domain.                     if NewAppVersionReady  return          DeleteFiles         CopyFiles         RestartAppDomain          finally              Monitor.Exitlocker       codepre  pRestartAppDomain looks like this. Note that I get an exception when I unload the app domain on the second line in this method. I get around that by catching the exception and basically ignoring it.p  precodeprivate void RestartAppDomain      this.tokenSource.Cancel     AppDomain.Unloadthis.appDomain     LoadApp  codepre  pEdit Ive since found out that the AppDomain.Unload line is unnecessary. Without it, the service still updates the app with a new version and then starts the new version of the app. My big concern is calling Cancel on the token source. Id like the app to be able to shut down gracefully instead of just forcing it shut.p

Negative 5210 pIm working on a scala  lift web application and am considering how to set everything up. Ill be running this in Amazon EC2 and I can have a fairly flexible architecture.p  pMy current approach is to use ELB configured with sticky sessions lift requirement, an nginx frontend, with glassfish or perhaps jetty in the backend. nginx would be nice for url rewriting and pushing static content although putting my static content into an Amazon S3 bucket is under consideration. Im unsure if I should throw out ELB and use HAProxy instead. Ill need to be adding and removing glassfish instances to dynamically scale according to load. Can nginx dynamically load balance across multiple glassfish instances Do I need to maintain a 11 ratio of nginx to glassfish instances Will ELB  nginx handle this appropriately How would you configure ELBnginxglassfish so this would work Does it make sense to use nginx Should I just load balance directly across a glassfish clusterp  pThanks for any help you can providep

Negative 5210 pThis question gets asked a lot, but I still havent found a straight answer on stackoverflow. Are these two functions sufficient or not There are a lot of contradictory comments around the internet yes its fine, no, never use it. Others say, use PDO, which I dont understand. Im just a beginner to PHP, so I dont fully understand all of the ins and outs of security.

Negative 5210 pA web service has been written by a third party to link my PHP CMS to a MS Dynamics CRM. This is a web service that I have to use the default SOAP and REST APIs that come with Dynamics is not something we are allowed to use. I am having difficulties working out how to pass a record of namevalue pairs to one of the web service functions.p  pWe are using nusoap to talk to the web service, as we have more chance of fixing the SOAP handling to talk nicely with the MS code, than if we were at the mercy of what SOAP handling PHP provides.p  pI dont know much about ASP, but the function in question is defined [roughly] like thisp  precodepublic class UserWebservice  System.Web.Services.WebService      public DataSet UpdateContactAddressstring ContactId, ListltKeyValuePairltstring, stringgtgt Address              ...       codepre  pI can pass in the ContactId, but then have an associative array of address parts cityMy City etc to pass into the Address parameter. I cannot work out how to do that. If I knew what XML the web service was expecting to receive, then I could work backwards from there, but the structure is just an unknown to me.p  pThe web service developer can only tell me it is the standard format, whatever that means.p  pIn case it helps, this is how the UpdateContactAddress processes the parameterp  precodeEntity contact  new Entitycontact contact.Id  new GuidContactId foreach KeyValuePairltstring, stringgt AddressPart in Address      contact[AddressPart.Key]  AddressPart.Value  codepre  pIf there is a better data type to use for the web service to accept a record of namevalue pairs, then I could probably argue the case for it to be changed.p  pIt would be nice to think that using a WSDL means all this just works, but I accept it wont PHPltgtMS haha and am building the elements manually in parameters passed to nusoap nesting soapval objects and arrays as needed, which works for simple arrays of values.p  hr  pEditbr Just to add to one of that latter points about changing the datatype, if something like this, assuming it is syntactically correct, will be easier to handle, then I would go along with thatp  precodeKeyValuePairltstring, stringgt[] Address codepre  pi.e. a simple numerickeyed array of namevalue pairs, which I understand is not as simple as a keyvalue array element in PHP. Passing in simple arrays to the MS web service works for me, so removing the unknowns is a good move. The problem  here is no debug activity on the MS side  they get the data or they dont, and if they dont, it is my fault for not passing it right but there are no clues what right actually is. Im hoping somebody here has done this and got it working, and can point me in the right direction.p

Negative 5210 pI need to create user control with Texbox TextmodeMultiline or html textarea.p  pWhen in edit mode Textboxtextarea has to be resizable. I can use some jquery plugin for this. But in read only mode this Textboxtextarea is disabled and it must be automatically resized height to fit the text. Even if text takes pages.

Negative 5210 pNow, I am aware that there is no such thing as exiting an app in Android. By this I mean that the process corresponding to an app is kept in memory even after all the activities in that app are destroyed. For sake of simplicity, lets keep services and such out of the picture. The process is only killed when the system decides to do so in order to reclaim memory.p  pHowever, once all my activities have been destroyed, I would assume that the process corresponding to my app is no longer active. By this I mean that since my app is not doing any work, I assume the process no longer performs allocations. Is this assumption correctp  pI used the simple default codeHelloWorldcode example that Eclipse ADT gives me via the codeNew Android Project Wizardcode and saw that this is not the case. strongEven after I close the app, I can still track allocations in DDMSstrong.

Negative 5210 pI just finished implementing a custom membership provider and after the whole thing was done Im just wondering why is it nessesary p  pIn my project Im using Open ID to authenticate and once I have the users Open ID I forward them right off the bat to get OAuth requestaccess token then log them in using forms authentication. Im only ever using the CreateUser and GetUser from the membership provider.p  pCan I just use my own Repository to store all of the data I need AccessToken, Username, OpenId, etc or is there something Im not seeing behind the scenes that I should be aware aboutp

Negative 5210 pI hope this isnt too much of an arbitrary question, but I have been looking through the source codes of Faile and TSCP and I have been playing them against each other. As far as I can see the engines have a lot in common, yet Faile searches 1.3 million nodes per second while TSCP searches only 300k nodes per second.p  pThe source code for faile can be found here a hrefhttpfaile.sourceforge.netdownload.phphttpfaile.sourceforge.netdownload.phpa. TSCP source code can be found here a hrefhttpwww.tckerrigan.comChessTSCPhttpwww.tckerrigan.comChessTSCPa.p  pAfter looking through them I see some similarities both use an array board representation although Faile uses a 144 size board, both use a alpha beta search with some sort of transposition table, both have very similar evaluate functions. The main difference I can find is that Faile uses a redundant representation of the board by also having arrays of the piece locations. This means that when the moves are generated by very similar functions for both programs, Faile has to for loop through fewer bad pieces, while maintaining this array costs considerably fewer resources.p  pMy question is why is there a 4x difference in the speed of these two programs Also, why does Faile consistently beat TSCP I estimate about a 200 ELO difference just by watching their moves For the latter, it seems to be because Faile is searching several plies deeper.p

Negative 5210 pI have a .getJSON call thats too long to post here.  It all works fine except when I try to hide a div.  My data is coming back from the database in the callback as data and is processed in a for loop with i as the increment in the callback.  All of my data displays elsewhere fine.  But when I try to do thisp  precodevar div  row  data[i].id div.hide codepre  pit fails.p  pI can replace data[i].id with the row number from the database and the div is hidden.  If I alert div, I get row664 or whatever.  Something about the combination of row and the dynamically generated ID is causing the hide to fail.  p  pThe HTML in the same callback isp  precode   html  ltdiv idrow  data[i].id  gt codepre  pThe HTML is appended to a div at the end of the callback.  Everything else works, like I said.  So it seems like this should work.  What am I doing wrongp
Negative 5210 pI am required to write a library in C which will emulate NOR flash like behavior.  Platform  Windows, LanguageC Sorry for a very long post, I am trying to explain what I have done so far  p  pstrongRequired behaviorstrongp  pSo, this is how its supposed to work, I am required to return range of memory, which the user will use as flash memory. He should be able to read any bytes from the returned memory buffer, which is not a problem, the main problem comes in write, because, the write behavior of flashes is different, such that you can only reset a bit, if an address has contentin binary 10101010 and user tries to write 01011001 to that address, then that location should actually contain 10101010 amp 01011001  00001000 after write. I am not sure how to get this done p  pstrongThese are the approaches I am thinking ofstrongp  pI need to have the data stored as a file internally to be able to use it multiple times and analyze after multiple use, so I am plaaning to use a memory mapped fileIO to return the memory. read is not an issue, but I am not sure how to trap memory writes and apply AND mask before writing it. p  pFollowing are some of the ways I was thinking of... p  pemApproach 1emp  pMark the exposed pointer as readonly, hence allowing user to do direct reads from memory, but for write, we can expose an interface which will be the only interface for writing into the memory. Since its our interface, we can handle the requirement of applying masking. p  pAdvantages p  p Keeps the implementation simple. p  pDisadvantages p  p Reduces the usability of module by putting restriction on user regarding write. p  pemApproach 2emp  pWrite a class which will overload all the possible memory access operators. Something like thisp  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt class flashMemory      T data public     void operator  T newData data amp newData      Overload other operators too...  codepre  pAdvantage   Again keeps the implementation simple. p  pDisadvantage   Even though we can handle most of the write cases, we cant handle these in situations like in the following codesnippet. p  precodeflashMemory flashPtr  flashObj.getPointer flashPtr[10]  X                        Using overloaded operator, This is fine memcpyflashPtr, someBuff, someSize    This is NOT fine ... char myPtr  voidflashPtr    Everything below using typecasted ptr is NOT fine.  myPtr[100]  X memcpymyPtr, 0, someSize memcpymyPtr, destPtr, dataSize codepre  pSo, this might again not be a complete solution, and can actually cause lot of issues with any new code. p  pemApproach 3emp  pThird approach is to set page protection to READONLY and trap any write attempts through a signal handlermprotect and sigaction on Linux but as of now I can only trap the write calls but not yet able to get any more info to complete the write request. Will look into it to see if its possible to trap the write calls and write data after applying mask.  If this is possible, it can be complete solution. p  pAdvantagesp  p1 Can handle write requests transparently without any changes to the user using emulator. p  pThis looks perfect, but I am only able to get interrupts saying there was a access violation, but I dont know how to actually get the data being written and apply mask before writing it in interrupt handler But I tried this in Linux, have not done this in Windowsp  pemApproach 4emp  pHave some emulated device with memory mapped IO and any writes to the memory range of device will come to my device driver with which I can do whatever I want. p  pThis is just a thought, I am not sure if this could be done at all, and even if done, might be an overkill for my requirement. p  pstrongApproach 4strongp  pTo support read and write transparently like in approach3,  we can use linuxs FUSE framework equivalent of Windows as of now I got DOKAN a hrefhttpdokandev.neten relnofollowhttpdokandev.netena and CBFS a hrefhttpwww.eldos.comcbfs relnofollowhttpwww.eldos.comcbfsa. Using this we can present our code as a filesystem to the system and all the read and write calls will be diverted to our code in the userspace where we can manipulate the data anyway we want.  So, our code will have 2 pieces,p  ol lipThe library that exposes flashemulator class to the application writer the one we have now,   This will open flash emulation file in the userspace filesystem that we create and does a memorymapped fileio and return the mapped address to the user, using which the application writer can do memory operations that will be translated to the file system actions read and write. pli lipSimple userspace file system.  This will implement basic required interfaces required from the user space filesystem and internally uses the systems file system to actually store the file. And read and write operations implemented will access the data stored on disc. Read will be starightread from the file like we have now, but write operation will apply mask and write to the file system. pli ol  pAdvantages    Can transparently support all the memory operations and emulate flashlike  behaviour behind the scene. p  pDisadvantage    It requires external frameworks that need to be used which will be much bigger than the code that we write.  I need to check if they are free frameworks or not, I am not sure yet, will check and comeback if they are not freep  pIt might be an overkill to implement a userspace filesystem just to have transparent flashlike write characteristic, but if doing it without affecting application writers code is more important, then this looks like one of the possibility.  Please let me know of your view on this. Thank you.p  pThank you,p  pMicrokernelp

Negative 5210 pIm trying to understand a problem I have run into that I dont believe should be possible when dealing with transactions utilizing the read committed isolation level. I have a table that is being used as a queue.  In one thread connection 1 I insert multiple batches of 20 records into each table.  Each batch of 20 records is performed inside a transaction.  In a second thread connection 2 I perform an update to change the status of the records that have been inserted into the queue, which also occurs inside a transaction.  When running concurrently, it is my expectation that the number of rows affected by the update connection 2 should be a multiple of 20, since connection 1 is inserting rows in the table inserts in batches of 20 rows within a transaction.  p  pBut my testing shows this is not always the case, and on occasion Im able to update a subset of records from connection 1s batch.  Should this be possible or am I missing something about transactions, concurrency, and isolation levels  Below is a set of test scripts I created to reproduce this issue in TSQL.p  pemstrongThis script inserts 20,000 records into the table in transaction batches of 20.emstrongp  precodeUSE ReadTest GO  SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED GO  SET NOCOUNT ON  DECLARE transid INTEGER DECLARE cmdid INTEGER DECLARE textstr VARCHAR4000  SET transid  0 SET textstr  Placeholder String Value                   First empty the table DELETE FROM TABLEA  WHILE transid lt 1000 BEGIN     SET transid  transid  1     SET cmdid  0      BEGIN TRANSACTION   Insert 20 records into the table per transaction     WHILE cmdid lt 20 BEGIN         SET cmdid  cmdid  1          INSERT INTO TABLEA  transactionid, commandid, [type], status, textfield               VALUES  transid, cmdid, 1, 1,  textstr      END                  COMMIT  END  PRINT DONE codepre  pemstrongThis script updates the records in the table, changing the status from 1 to 2 and then checks the rowcount from the update operation.

Its really convenient as you move from input value to result stepbystep, you can focus on a single transformation and you dont need to move cursor as you type.

Negative 5210 pIm reinventing dozens of wheels, badly ... p  pIm writing python code to validate user input from an html form, before prompting the user to make corrections or writing it to my database.p  pIve scoured the web for guidance on how to verify each input type correcting whitespace in a string, ensuring float with x decimal points, title words capitalized, dates in proper format, integers within set range, emails, urls, etc. Im using various regex and string methods to validate each, but there are so many data types, and this is my first real app  its taking me forever and, moreover, Im nowhere near a good enough programmer to anticipate all the things that could go wrong.p  pSurely someone has collected a library of useful verification code snippets that people can adapt Ive looked and looked, but can only find very specific answers to each problem, nothing uptodate that collects the basic starting points for each input type in one place.p  pIm using Google App Engine, Jinja templates so all my escaping is done automatically, and HTML5 input types but I dont believe they provide any security on old browsers. Im using dropdown  menus where possible, so that I can easily verify whether the input exactly matches my required answers.p  pAny suggestions of where I might find a collection of useful startingpoint snippetsp  pMany thanks,   T.p

Rather, for each observed codexicode, codefxipicode and thus codelogLikelihoodSumlogfxiSumlogpicode. p  pThe function I am trying to maximize is codesumlogpilamdasumpi1code where codesumpi1code i.e. this is a constrained maximization problem which can be solved using Lagrange multiplier.p  pThe answer to this problem is codepi1ncode where codencode is the number of data points. However, optimx does not seem to give this solution. Does anybody have any idea. If coden2code, the function I am maximizing is codelogp1logp2lamdap1p21code.p  pHere is my code and output from Rp  precoden2 log.likefunctionp    lamdap[n1]   ll0   fori in 1n     temp  logp[i]lamdap[i]lamdan     lllltemp      returnll    mle  optimxc0.48,.52,1.5,              log.like,              lowercrep0.1,2,3,              uppercrep.9,2,1,              method  LBFGSB  gt mle              par  fvalues   method fns grs itns conv  KKT1 KKT2 xtimes 1 0.9, 0.9, 1.0 1.010721 LBFGSB   8   8 NULL    0 FALSE   NA      0 codepre  pThe solution to the equation when coden2code is codep1p212code and codelamda2code.

The problem is I do not have direct admin access to the server, only folder access to edit files including web.config. So my question is.. is it possible to force the script to run in 32bit mode from a setting in the web.config  aspx file only ie. No serverIIS changes Otherwise ill have to battle a bureaucracy to get the changes made to the server p  pThanks allp

Negative 5210 pI have a large graph which represents a set of dependencies.  A user can specify that they want to use a certain number of these dependencies and I need to figure out the correct order to use them they may specify dependent nodes which are not directly related, but which are dependent through other nodes in the graph.p  pCurrently I am implementing this by running a topological sort of the graph and stopping once all of the nodes the user specified have been sorted.

Negative 5210 pI am trying to make a WCF service which uses callbacks to the client. I would like the channel to be kept open as long as there is a connection internet, network and either the client or channel have not explicitly closed the channel.p  pIn order to keep the channel open even without activity I found the reliable sessions that WCF supports. I see that by using reliable sessions, there are two timers which one needs to take into consideration the codeBinding.ReceiveTimeoutcode and the codeReliableSession.InactivityTimeoutcode. p  pAfter searching on the internet, I am still unable to understand exactly how these two work together. I know that if either of the two times out, the connection goes into faulted state.p  pMy first question What exactly happens when reliable sessions are enablep  pMy second question a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.servicemodel.channels.binding.receivetimeout.aspx relnofollowHerea, why does msdn say the followingp  blockquote   pSince the connection is dropped if either inactivity timer fires,   increasing InactivityTimeout once it is greater than ReceiveTimeout   has no effect. The default for both of these timeouts is 10 minutes,   so you always have to increase both of them to make a difference when   using a reliable session.p blockquote

Negative 5210 pI am interested in seeing how a single printf statement or Override toString method can be used to give accurate information when there are possible different subclasses that may need to be referenced in it.p  pHere is the Example program set upp  pclass Animal  String name  int age class Bird extends Animal  private int feathers  Animal animalObj  to reference the animal object vars class Monkey extends Animal  private int weight  Animal animalObj to reference the animal object vars class Tree  int heightInFeet  Animal animalInTree to reference the instantiated animal objectp  pClass tree has a boolean inTree method which if true means the animal is in the tree class tree has 2 more methods... public Animal nowInTree public Animal hasLeftTreep  peach of these methods need a println or printf statement to list out the charastics of the animal as well... Heres the catch, the Bird class has a param int feathers and the Monkey class has a param double weight. p  pmy output to console called form the Tree class should equal somthing like....The bird named Falcon that is 3 years old with 912 feathers has left the tree.p  pTHEN using the SAME method or perhaps even the same printf statement can ALSO print to console...The monkey named Bubba who is 9 years old 22.5lbs is its weight has left the tree. p  ppossible printf statement assumes created super and subclass methods  though this is incomplete p  pSystem.out.printfThe animal named s who is d years old s has left the tree,  animalInTree.getAnimalName, animalObj.getAge, wtfGoesHere.callMeth, p  pok notice that I need to get the var from each of the subclasses which the wtfGoesHere method represents.  The wtfGoesHere has to return not only the var weight or feathers but also extra info attached...so not just the weight but its weight is d.   p  pWeight and Feathers var have to be private.  Although if publis will that solve it  If yes, is that still risky coding  I am an amature still but sometimes working around the privates is chapping my arse.p  pI am stumped as the compiler currently DOES know the info in the Animal class but not the subclasses of Monkey and Bird.  I can make a getBlaBla for the info in the sub classes but cannot figure out how to tell java which one to use when.p  pPossible thoughts...p  ol lipmake exception handling and add in an extra param in the printf method and when it hits that field it will use the one it can and throw an exception on the other...If even possible I do not know expcetions yet, I am in advanced java class and that is a month away.  The homework implies it will not allow for exception handling.  although I am curious if this will workpli lipCreate some sort of cascading if else which will determine which subclass is needed and then.  Still problematic as the methods I am restricted in making do not include passing the subclass objects...only accepting the Animal class as an object param to pass inside the Tree class.pli lipUse the Tree class toString overide method to handle this...although I still bump up against 2 the above.pli lipWe learned about absract classes and the implements functions  So I am open to that as well if this can solve my problem...so long as the hasLeftTree method can handle both subclass possibilities.  If I didnt specifically state the hasLeftTree method does specifically call a print statement giving all the info on teh subclass including its animal extension info.pli ol  pI mention the above to try to show that I have put some thought in this and am not just whining for hand holding.  also, despite the restrictions above my teacher has...on occasion...declared that he wants us to find functions not specifically mentioned in class...so...if you belive that the appropriate industry accepted standard requires going off instructions I will argue that to my professor.p  pI will provide more code if needed.  Everyting else works in the programs which consists of 4 files...the 3 classes and the main method file.p  pThoughts and TYVM in advance code gods.p

Negative 5210 pHi I have a question that is braking my mind for some days. I have my SQL server Database and my C application. In the DB I have differemt tables, let me show you a simple ex Tables Person Relationship Cityp  pBusiness Rules The person are from a City, so the person has IdCity A person has a relationship with other person, and about that relationship you need to save the starting date.p  pIn other projects I already did something like that, but in this proyect this is not working for me.p  pWhen I retrieved with LinQ the information about the person, the city is not coming, and an error appears when I try person.city.description, for ex. I try using IncludeCity in the linq query, but it didnt work. Besides that, I dont know how to manage the circular reference to the person to person relationship.p  pOne important thing, that I think that can be the problem, is that I rename all the tables from the DataModel, for example, the table in database is called PrdCity, so I change the Name and the Entity Set Name for City in c project. So in the included I have to use the real table name, in other case the query fail, but if I use the real name nothing happens.p  precodeusing var context  new MyContext     ListltPersongt oPeople  from p in context.Person.IncludePrdCity                            select p.ToList    return oPeople   codepre  pAny help will be welcome. Thanksp

These outstanding changes are the changes that were previously applied in his own migration but are now unaccounted for after applying Dev1s migration, even though the changes actually have already been applied.  It seems that the model validation is confused, thinking those changes were never applied as a result of applying Dev1s migration.li ol  pstrongOur solutionstrong Dev2 creates a new migration and empties out the Up and Down methods, then runs updatedatabase.

Negative 5210 pIm new to Arduino, and one thing I came across is this cool tool called Embedxcode, which basically allows you to compile and run sketches on the Arduino from Xcode instead of from the normal Arduino compiler.p  pThe reason Im using this is because I want the user to be able to do something on the Arduino i.e. push a button and the computer responds i.e. call some function in ObjectiveC. Since as far as I know you cant do that from the Arduino compiler, Ive decided to use Xcode because it can compile ObjectiveC and use the OSX SDK.p  pI got Embedxcode to work the Arduino code compiles and uploads to the board fine, but I cant get ObjectiveC working. As in, I cannot create a new ObjectiveC class to pass data to without Xcode giving me errors and no, renaming the C files to .mm did not work.p  pDoes anybody know how to solve this Or is there a better way to get Arduino to directly interact with OSX eventsp

Negative 5210 pI really lack experience on developing things on Windows, and I may have missed some obvious things, try to stay calm p  pI have an application Qt C which uses some code.dllcodes from its own path I mean I deliver those code.dllcodes along with the .exe. When I deliver the app, I compress the dlls via a hrefhttpupx.sourceforge.net relnofollowupxa. It dramatically compresses them and I can use those codedllcodes without decompressing.p  pI have the impression that I am doing something wrong but it just works by chance, so I wanted to be sure, is it ok to use a compressed dll Or should I expect unpredictable problems at anytime emThis is being the main questionemp  pIf code.dllcodes can be used in compressed mode so why the earth do we have them uncompressed in the first place.p

If I were to visit this url directly though through the address bar, no videos are retrieved.  Ive been playing around with calls to serialize but cant get it working and Im not sure Im even on the right path.  Ive also noticed that once I visit the url directly and get no videos, if I then go directly to the listings url which loads content just fine and select any of the videos links, the video content is no longer loaded for any of entries.  However, if I refresh my browserapp while on the listings url then content exists under the videos links.p  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pIf I change the original code segment above to instead bep  precode listingslistingidvideos App.VideosRoute  Ember.Route.extend     model functionparams      return App.Listings.findparams.listingid       codepre  pit works as expected, although I do not understand why.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pIt did break the View Video link however when accessing the listings1videos url directly and not via a link.

I am using the Spring Data codeGridFsOperationscode class to do my GridFS readwrites.p  pI have a requirement to replace the content of an existing GridFS file i.e. the codeidcode and codefilenamecode should stay the same, but the file content should be updated.p  pSpring Data code[GridFsOperations]code a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringdatamongodbdocs1.2.xapi relnofollowAPIa primarily allows codefindcode, which returns a Mongo codeGridFSDBFilecode, and codestorecode. codeGridFSDBFilecode a hrefhttpapi.mongodb.orgjava2.10.1commongodbgridfsGridFSDBFile.html relnofollowAPIa does not allow updating content. The codestorecode method could in theory be used if the file was deleted first, and then stored with the same codeidcode as the previous file. However codestorecode does not allow specifying the codeidcode field.p  pThe only solution I have found so far is to use the Mongo API directly to delete the existing file, and store a new one with the same codeidcode. Answers to this effect are not useful the question is specific to Spring Data MongoDB.p

All works fine in building a py2app version of my software on the Mac for my OS 10.6 but when I run on 10.8 I encountered the following errorp  precodeTraceback most recent call last  File UI.pyc, line 603 createHeatMap  File clustering.pyc, line 31, in ltmodulegt  File mpltoolkitsinit.pyc, line 2, in ltmodulegt  File SystemLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersions2.6Extraslibpythonpkgresources.py, line 698, in ltmodulegt  File SystemLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersions2.6Extraslibpythonpkgresources.py, line 701, in Environment  File SystemLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersions2.6Extraslibpythonpkgresources.py, line 96, in getsupportedplatform  File SystemLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersions2.6Extraslibpythonpkgresources.py, line 222, in getbuildplatform  File SystemLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersions2.6libpython2.6distutilsutil.py, line 98, in getplatform  File SystemLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersions2.6libpython2.6distutilssysconfig.py, line 537, in getconfigvars  File SystemLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersions2.6libpython2.6distutilssysconfig.py, line 405, in initposix DistutilsPlatformError invalid Python installation unable to open userincludepython2.6pyconfig.h No such file or directory codepre  pThis is fixed by saving the file pyconfig.h to the designated location on the destination machine not present in 10.8 but present in 10.6, which allows my application to work fine.

Negative 5210 pCan you have an object shared across multiple WSGI threadsprocesses and in a manner that would work on both NIX and Windowsp  pThe basic premise 1 I have a WSGI front end that will connect to a back end server. I have a serialization class, that contains rules on how to serializeunserialize various objects, including classes specific to this project. As such, it needs to have some setup telling it how to handle custom objects. However, it is otherwise stateless  multiple threads can access it at the same time to serialize their data without issue. 2 There are sockets to connect to the back end. Id rather have a socket pool than createdestroy every time theres a connection.p  pNote I dont mind a solution where there are multiple instances of 1 and 2, but ideally, Id like them createdinitialized as few times as possible. Im not sure about the internals, but if a thread loops rather than closing and having the server reopen on a new request, it would be fine to have one data set per thread and hence, the socket and serializer are initialized once per thread, but reused each subsequent call it handles. Actually having one socket per thread, if thats how it works, would be best, since I wouldnt need a socket pool and have to deal with mutexes.p  pNote this is not sessions and has nothing to do with sessions. This shouldnt care who is making the call to the server. Its only about tweaking performance on systems that have slow thread creation, or a lot of memory but relatively slow CPUs.p  pEdit 2 The below code will give some info on how your system shares variables.

Negative 5210 pI am currently debugging a crash in one of my applications and stumbled up on something that looks a bit odd to me. In my application I start several threads using beginthreadex function. At some random point in time sometimes after several hours one of the threads crashes for a yet unknown reason. The stack trace at the time of the crash looks like thisp  precodemy.dllthreadvoid  p0x241e0140  Line 792  0xf bytes    C msvcr90.dllendthreadex   0x44 bytes    msvcr90.dllendthreadex   0xd8 bytes    kernel32.dllBaseThreadStart8   0x37 bytes  codepre  pwhere thread is the main loop function of my thread. I omitted the stack frames above my thread function here. The crash is an access violation and happens each time at the same location with the exact same bad pointer value.p  pNow what made me think is that endthreadex occurs in the stack trace. I tried to reproduce this in a small sample program and caused an access violation there too. However the stack trace looks differentp  precodetest.exethreadvoid  vpb0x00000000  Line 9  0x3 bytes  C test.execallthreadstartex  Line 348  0x6 bytes C test.exethreadstartexvoid  ptd0x000328e8  Line 326  0x5 bytes    C kernel32.dllBaseThreadStart8   0x37 bytes codepre  pThe corresponding code is thisp  precodestatic unsigned stdcall thread void  vpb       int a  int0xdeadbeef     a  0      return 1   int main      HANDLE th  HANDLEbeginthreadex NULL, 0, thread, 0, CREATESUSPENDED, NULL       forint i0 iltINTMAX              i           ResumeThreadth      forint i0 iltINTMAX              i           return 0  codepre  pThe original code looks similar to this but is obviously more complex. So Im no wondering if the differences in the stack trace might be caused by my modifications to the code when implementing the small example or if all this shows that there is a problem with a corrupted stack.p  pSo my question is basically Is it possible that BaseThreadStart calls endthreadex which again calls the thread function itself And if so, can someone explain why this is the case because to me it looks odd and Im thinking if this points out some problem which might be related to my initial problem of the crashing thread.p  pThanks in advance for your suggestions.p

So, no help there.p  pThe problem seems to be a bug in the MonoTouch binding, Xamarin.iOS, or the Facebook iOS SDK itself. Any ideasp

Negative 5210 pI have a problem with this method Ive written in Java.p  pThe method is to take two strings. The first string codesArrcode is to track the letters added as the second string is parsed.

Each integer refers to a different array of letters, for examplep  precode String[] two  A, B, C codepre  pAt the moment it is an auxiliary method for another one.

Im using jQuery to fade those in and out. The fading out of the original div works when you click the link, and then I have a switch case to determine what gets faded in.

Negative 5210 precodeMyClass[] CLASS  new MyClass[5] int[] STRUCT  new int[5] codepre  pWhat exactly is new [] doing for a class vs a struct. Apparently the struct has some overloaded static index that causes it to run the default constructor of the struct. However the new [] for a class appears to do nothing but make space to initialize an instance of a class. How do I overload the static behavior of the class to also run the default constructor. I know how to use for loops and other methods of accomplishing this. My question is very specific to what is going on underneath the new []. I understand that a struct needs a default value. But doesnt a nonnullable class also need a default value which is why it gives an error when you try to use it Or is this telling me that all classes are actually nullablep

Negative 5210 pI am developing a C application with EntityFramework and CodeFirst model. I would like to have a local database on each machine and each application installation.

Negative 5210 pI want to write a lexer that has multiple modes.  But the modes are mostly similar.  The only difference is that I reference the same character by a different name.  I have it working, the problem is I have to copy the entire lexer change all the names, add types, and add one line for each mode.p  pHere is the general problem I want to solve.  I want a comma to have high precedence outside a [ ].  I want it to have a low precedence inside the code[code, code]code.  To do that I push and pop modes with the code[code and code]code.  But since the only thing I am changing is the precedence I have to copy all the rules into each mode and given them different names.  p  pOne additional thing, once inside a code[code there would be no way to get back to the high precedence comma.  So when the grammar moves into a codecode, codecode section the comma reverts back to high precedence.  p  pIn order to accomplish this I have the initial default mode plus codeCONJUNCTIONcode high precedence and codeNONCONJUNCTIONcode low precedence.  I copy all the rules from the default mode and rename them to codeCcode or codeNCcode.  Then I assign their type back to the type of the default mode.p  pI would rather accomplish this without coping, renaming, and assigning types to all the rules from the default mode.  p  pHere is my lexerp  precodelexer grammar DabarLexer  OPENPAREN   gt pushModeNONCONJUNCTION  CLOSEPAREN   gt popMode OPENBRACKET  [ gt pushModeNONCONJUNCTION  CLOSEBRACKET  ] gt popMode  OPENCURLY   gt pushModeCONJUNCTION  CLOSECURLY   gt popMode  SPACE     HEAVYCOMMA  , ENDLINE  n  PERIOD  .

Negative 5210 pNot sure exactly how to title this question, because Im not 100 certain what the problem is.  I assume that while downloading the latest changes to our repository a file has been corrupted.p  pOne of our source files came out looking like thisp  precode  public class UIWidgetInspector  Editor      enum Action          None,      Scale,        codepre  pI have no idea why this has happened, but when I look at the file on GitHub is appears fine, and the other programmer is not having this problem. I am assuming that there was some corruption when I fetched the remote branches.p  pMy first instinct was to delete and redownload all of my remote branches, but I have no idea how to do this.p  pI have triedp  precodegit branch rd originmaster codepre  pAnd then fetching again, but no data is actually downloaded presumably because the commits still exist locally.p  pBasically I have no idea whats going on, and short of cloning the repo again which Id rather not do, I am completely lost.p
Negative 5210 pI have a codeListViewcode with each row consisting of a codeTextViewcode and a codeCheckBoxcode.p  pThe user is allowed to click on each codeTextViewcode, and once he does a Dialog is presented to him where he is expected to either choose Yes or No.p  pWhen he chooses Yes, another activity is presented to him where he needs to enter data. p  pI am implementing all this inside a base adapter class, so inside the base adapter I created the codeAlertDialogcode and handled its codeOnClickListenerscode.  p  pHere is the problem I need to use codestartActivityForResultcode in order to get back the data that the user will enter in the new activity, and like I said above, I have done so in the codeBaseAdaptercode.  Now, how can I get the data from the new activity back inside the codeBaseAdaptercode  I researched various sources and found out that one cannot start an Intent directly from a codeBaseAdaptercode class, but instead needs to reference the Intent to the calling activity like belowp  precodeActivity mContext.startActivityForResultintent, 1         codepre  pThis would then result in having the the codeonActivityResultcode method in the adapter Activity and not inside the codeBaseAdaptercode. I need to leave the code inside the codeBaseAdaptercode for various reasons.  p  pThe value I need to retrieve is a simple codebooleancode that if it results to true, will tick the codeCheckBoxcode next to the selected codeTextViewcode.p  pHow could I implement this What alternatives do you guys suggest  I tried creating a method inside the codeBaseAdaptercode so that I can call it from the main Activity at the codeOnActivityResultcode but the codeCheckBoxcode that I need to tick is returning null at that point the reason being quite obvious. p  pI would appreciate any help on this matter.p  pemInside BaseAdapter classemp  precode       final AlertDialog.Builder builder  new AlertDialog.BuildermContext         builder.setTitleMaterials         builder.setMessageDid you require any materials to fix this error         builder.setPositiveButtonYes, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                      Override             public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int which                              String clickedError                 clickedError  holder.text.getText.toString                  Intent intent  new IntentmContext, Material.class                 intent.putStringArrayListExtramaterialList, materialList                 intent.putExtraclickedError, clickedError                 intent.putExtrarepairID, repairID                 Activity mContext.startActivityForResultintent, 1                                           builder.setNegativeButtonNo, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                      Override             public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int which                               ifcheckbox.getTag  v.getTag                                      checkbox.setCheckedtrue                                                               builder.show   Method to tick the checkbox.  public void TickBoxCheckBox cb      cb.setCheckedtrue  codepre  pemThe main activity containing OnActivityResultemp  precodeOverride protected void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data       ifresultCode  RESULTOK                         boolean moreThanOne  data.getBooleanExtramoreThanOne, false         ifmoreThanOne                      CheckBox cb  adapter.checkbox             adapter.TickBoxcb                  else                       ....                          codepre

Negative 5210 pI have a layout of boxes that are all floated left and when you click on their headings, they slide open revealing content. The issue is that the way floats work, when you click to expand one of them, it messes with the row underneath.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netFCCye relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netFCCyea lt click on one of the headings to see the issue.p  pIve solved this by separating them into columns like sop  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcaW4M relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netcaW4Map  pThat works fine, however, the layout needs to be responsive, so when the window is 480 or lower, it needs to be 1 column. Between 480 and 768 it needs to be 2 columns. Anything above 768, 3 columns. obviously, the jsfiddles dont show the breakpoints I have set up.p  pThis is the code Ive come up with to solve this, however it is not working at all.

So my thought is that at the different sizes, I would have to pull all of the boxes out of the columns, delete the columns, and reappend the columns in different numbers based on the window width. This has proved to be a failed attempt, so if anyone can explain to me what Im doing wrong I would be very appreciativep  pThanksp

Negative 5210 pI have inherited a code from a prev. employee of our company that I need to maintain. Since he has Microsoft Blend installed in his machine and chose a MVVM architecture to build the code, now I am wondering is there anywhere in the code, Xaml or somewhere that I might look and find out that Blend registered his name which may show UI is designed by Blend. If so, then its easier to continue and use this tool to make modifications to the code.p  pI know you might be asking, just go check the latest projects. But the situation is, the Blend is expiredunregistered and now I dont want to purchase or install a new trial to find out.p

Negative 5210 pIve inherited a solution to support based on .NET and SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pThe architecture is such that all clients must be kept in step with each other, and this is handled by a winsock hub to which each client sends and receives notifications of changes made. These notifications are in the form of a type of update and a key field.p  pOn receipt of a notification, client windows inspect the type of update and if they think they are interested then issue a database command Stored procedure to retrieve the latest data for that key value. The stored procedure typically invoked links a number of tables to return a rather large object.p  pMy problem is that when many clients are active, they are calling the same stored procedure at the same time and dragging perforamnce down e.g. a lt 1 second query, when called in isolation can take c20 seconds as it presumably waits for other clients to complete.p  pIs there anything out of the box in SQL server that can help me with this  Im thinking of caching of results or ways in which I can stop one query blocking another  p  pI appreciate that I should probably make some changes on the client code and notification process to pass around fully populated objects so removing the need to interrogate the database multiple times. However this is a legacy application with a limited lifespan, which would be a headache to upgrade in such a significant way. If there were a nice simple switch in SQL server I could use, that would buy me the time I needp  pThanks, Andrewp
Negative 5210 h2INTRODUCTION AND RELEVANT INFORMATIONh2  pI have an owner drawn static control.p  pIt should have bitmap on top of a gradient background.p  pStatic controls dimensions strongare not fixedstrong, they are calculated during the creation of parent window.p  pI load a bitmap with background color of RGB 255, 163, 94  from resource file.p  pUsing codeTransparentBlt ... , RGB 255, 163, 94  code API I stretchshrink bitmap to fit the static controls client area  bitmap is Device Dependant Bitmap, not a DIB, if that matters  .p  pBitmap picture has both horizontal and vertical resolution 150 DPI, 24 color bit depth, width 4395 pixels, and height 5613 pixels.p  pBitmap is loaded via codeLoadBitmap ... code API on codeWMCREATEcode.p  pThe original picture is bellow, but I have reduced its size, so I can upload itp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxWPaO.png altenter image description herep  h2THE PROBLEMh2  pThe problem is in quality of the picture.p  pBellow is the result I get after owner drawing the static controlp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXJJEN.png altenter image description herep  pThe empixelationem is obvious.p  pAspect ratio is lost as well, since I use codeTransparentBltcode.p  h2MY EFFORTS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEMh2  pBrowsing through SO archive, I have found similar questions, but they were related to Android. None of them helped me. Maybe my inexperience prevents me to see useful information.p  pFollowing one link from those questions I have learned about existence of image scaling algorithms. This is the page I have in mind a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiResampling28bitmap29 relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiResampling28bitmap29ap  pI have tried to use smaller bitmap, but picture is then blurry, even though I resolve empixelationem to some point.p  pIt seems that my problem lies in insufficient, or to much, data in bitmap so when I try to push large bitmap into small button, it just cant fit so I get empixelationem and emjaggedem effects, yet If I try to put small bitmap into big button, then data is missing which results in a blurry picture.p  pAfter browsing through Internet, I have seen advices and suggestions that this can be solved with vector graphics and meta files.p  pSince I am dumbstruck by this, I will ask several questions.p  pstrongIf the topic is broad then I ask the community to inform me of it through comments, and I will remove it and will try to rephrase it to fit the SO rules of posting questions better.strongp  h2QUESTIONSh2  pThis problem really happened unexpected to me, so I do not know how to start solving it, since I am fairly new to WIN32.p  pI must admit I am shocked, since I have expected that codeTransparentBltcode would do all the work for me.p  pHow can I solve this problem, so I can keep aspect ratio and quality of the picture  p  pI will consider the following solutionsp  ol lipCombining certain GDI API calls into my existing handler for stretchingshrinking, so I can achieve high quality and preserve aspect ratio of the picture, without modifying the code too much pli lipUsing GDI to solve my problem. I havent used GDI so far, but one has to start some day, why not now, if that is what will solve my problems pli lipIf vector graphics can solve my problem I must URGE the community to do me the following favor ANY recommendation of booktutorialdocumentationarticlecode example on Vector Graphics in PURE WIN32 would be greatly appreciated, since I myself havent found any.pli lipIf I must implement one of the scaling algorithms please recommend some bookstutorialslinkscode example, since I myself havent found any.pli ol  pstrongI cant use libraries, it is the restriction imposed upon mestrong, however, if the solution is acceptable strongand can be implemented faststrong, I could try to convince my employers to loosen their criteria, so libraries can be used.p  pIf my criteria to preserve strongbothstrong aspect ratio and quality of the picture is too much, I will choose the strongquality of the picturestrong then. I can always post a new question about aspect ratio, and maybe I will find a solution myself in the meanwhile.p  pThat would be all. Thank you for your patience and time.p  pRegards.p

Negative 5210 pi am confused in to keys in Database Managment System.as there are many partially questions...but this one is a good combined question.thats why i am posting here .

Thanks...p

I have also tried calling several relevent events for the RadGridView object, but nothing seems to work. I have also tried to call the ListChanged event for BindingList.p  pNone of these events work unless I click somewhere else on the RadGridView its as if the list doesnt actually change to begin with...

Negative 5210 pI am currently working on a program that uses an MVC design pattern and fragments in android java. I have figured out one of my fragments and gotten it working but when I copied the other fragments to follow the same code structure with specialized functionality, I get a null pointer exception in the onCreateView method.p  pIm on my junk laptop right now and it cant seem to handle android emulation so I can post the exact error code tomorrow. I have my source code though and I have been hitting my head against the wall long enough to know where it is breaking.p  pEDIT I see my problem.

Negative 5210 pMy Flask and modwsgi app seems to be breaking ports.  Every month or so my page will stop loading and I get a Google Chrome could not connect to  message, but moving it to a new port fixes it.  Ive checked the apache log and there doesnt seem to be anything wrong there.  If I stop apache from listening to the port and run my dev version of the Flask app on one of the ports that the live version has previously used I get the same Google Chrome could not connect to  message.  While apache is listening Netstat shows that the port is being listened to by apache and lsof i returns a bunch of apache processes that are using the port. Im not sure if any of that is normal for modwsgi.

Negative 5210 pMy algorithm will likely not be used on the web. The object I describe may be used by multiple threads, however. p  pThe original object I had designed emulated pointers. p  pReduced, a symbol would map to multiple pointers, and each unique pointer would map to a single symbol. p  pWhen I was finally finished and had a working algorithm, it turns out I actually needed six maps in total these maps are called tens of thousands of times. p  pInitial testing with a very very small sample set of symbols showed the program to be working very efficiently. However, Im afraid that once I increase the number of symbols by a few thousandfold it will become sluggish. p  pOnce the program completes and closes, the pointers do not need to persist. p  pI was wondering if I should re implement my algorithm using a database as a backend. Would this be better than using all of these maps p  pThe maps are stored in memory. The database will be stored on a hard drive I have a SSD, so Im afraid there will be a large difference in performance on my machine vs a machine using SATAPATA. The maps should also be O1. The maps might also become very ugly once multithreading is introduced, unless I use thread safe mapping, which would slow the program down. A database would efficiently handle these tasks. p  pIve formally written out the proper relations, and Im sure I can implement it in a database if that was the best option. Which is the better option p

I would guess that probably results from a bad design in the first place. p  pQuestion 2 What would be a good strategy to overcome this problem Creating objects to encapsulate all the parameters seems to be one option, but is there any other shortterm measures to overcome this problemp  pPs.

Negative 5210 pWe have a multitennant ASP.NET MVC application that hosts a booking engine for multiple clients.  Each of these clients has multiple packages that can influence Unity Container configuration.  We are creating a child container per request and registering different interface implementations based on the client and package parameters passed through the route.p  pCurrently we are accomplishing this by doing the followingp  ol liController has a property ServiceLocator that uses a unity container to resolve dependencies.li liController gets IUnityContainer injected and assigned to a property.li liController has a custom ActionFilterAttribute that accesses the controllers unity container, creates a child container, conditionally registers dependency implementations based on client and package route parameters, then assigns this child container to the controllers serviceLocator.li liController uses serviceLocator on demand to resolve individual dependencies.li ol  pThis works but is really clumsy and I feel eventually it will be unsustainable.  Im looking for a better solution.p  pWere stuck on .NET 4.0 at the moment until we wrap up some legacy stuff so Im targeting Unity 2 specifically.p  pIve tried creating a custom IDependencyResolver to create the child container and register dependencies based on route parameters storing the container in either Session or in HttpContext items but ran into the null HttpContext problems.

Negative 5210 pI am making a mobile app for a site with users, so in the app, users need to be able to sign in. To do this, I am creating a remember token to authenticate users on sign in. At first I was thinking about saving each token to the database and destroying it when the user signs out. When the user signs in, they would have the same token until they sign out. Then I saw somethings saying redis was the best way to store the tokens. My question is that if the only time a new token is created is when a user signs in and the only time it is destroyed is when a user signs out, is redis needed or is just saving it to the database ok performance wisep

Negative 5210 pIm making a little map codeDictionaryltstring, someEnumgtcode, basically and am wondering where to put the definition of this map. Itll only be used in this one method, and so it seems a little silly to pollute the namespace of the class with a private Dictionary and populate that dict in the constructor. What Id rather do is have the definition be at the place of use, but flagged in such a way as to tell the compiler not to trash it when the methods returned. I suspect that in normal usecases, this method will be called thousands of times per hour, so minimizing the overhead would be nice. p  pSo my question is Is there a keyword in C, maybe codeconstcode, that will have this effect, and if not, whats the best practice here p

Negative 5210 pFirst, Im sorry  but Im very new to Access and I may not use the proper terms, but I will definitely try. Here is what Im attempting to work onp  pI have a Table and a Form. Data entry is done through the Form and it posts to the Table. p  pThe Primary Key is SITE. Im cataloguing credit slips sent and received to and from each Site. HOw I have this set up currently is on the form, no field other than site is required. THeres a PU NUM pick up number, the number generates by the warehouse specific to the Site and prepended by PU and a REF NUM reference number, the number given by the the warehouse when they receive the credit, and matches the PU NUM with the exception its prepended by 000. Both sets of numbers are 6 digits. My workaround for that is to format both datasets as 000000000 so the data sets CAN match. p  pThe Form, p  pstrongSITEstrongp  hr  pPU NUMp  pPU DATEp  pPU PCSp  pPU RETAILp  hr  pREF NUMp  pREF DATEp  pREF PCSp  pREF RETAILp  pWhat the input workflow isp  pThe user inputs the SITE and moves to either PUN NUM or REF NUM in the form along with the other associated data. An entry is created. Easy. If the user returns at a later date and has a REF NUM that matches a PU NUM, Id like the entry to append the existing entry rather than create a new entry. p  p1. Is that possible 2. If so, any assistance on this would be deeply appreciatedp

Negative 5210 pI am currently in the process of writing a web application using JSP and have logging setup being written to a file during the apps running lifetime. The log information in this case is very important to the user and I would like to display it somehow. At first I thought of using some kind of actionListener on the Logger object itself and using a scriptlet inside the JSP to append text into a Text Area element but Im not quite sure if that would work. Is there an easy or known way to do this Any feedback and help is greatly appreciated. Right now I am using the regular apache Logger object but am certainly open to using outside libraries such as Log4j or other options to achieve what I need.p  pAm I not able to do this The text area would need to be updated without actually refreshing the whole page each time there is info written by the logger. If this is not able to be done, would a popup for processing be advisable This would probably be done with a popup, perhaps with JSwing but this may look ugly.p

Negative 5210 pI am creating a background timer which keeps track of time since user input. This is implemented as a codeServicecode, started and bind through codeActvitycode. What I have noticed is when the application is terminated swiped out through Recent Task menu, the integer counter in the service is restarted. p  pAfter further investigation I found out that the service is recreated and all previous information is lost. The service calls codeonTaskRemovedcode but is not destroyed. The service still keeps sending logs but with initial variable data. This is probably due to codeSTARTSTICKYcode flag set which restarts the service as soon as it is stopped.p  pI would like to maintain the variables in the service and keep counting the counter in the background. And when the user opens application, it binds to the service and updates UI with current timer value.p  pAs far as I see, the service is not restarted if it displays some UI element, such as Notification or Toast. In my case, I do not need any UI elements. I would like to have similar functionality like Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp where they do not show any elements and silently listen for new messages in background.p  pSo the question is Is it possible to maintain the service and its values and keep them running even after the user swipes away the main app from Recent Task listp

Negative 5210 pCan you please assist me in writing a query to remove duplicates. See below looking the results I have a column added as my status manually added. The category is the one determining where a record is a duplicate or not. In this case our main focus is cancellation. If for a member a cancellation has reinstatement after as member Y007. is not considered as a duplicate. But if a member has more than one cancellation then is considered as a duplicate because if we were to count a number of duplicates both of them will be counted which will give incorrect results. We need to just count a member once.

What i have found is that the iPython way of doing it only works when run from within an interactive session, or when using a .ipy filename extension, despite the fact that I dont believe i am using any Magic, and the regular python way of doing it wont work within ipython even if the script is named .py and is Pure python.p  pI want a way to be able to set my own exception hook for iPython from within a  script, even if it is called from the command line as a .py file.p  pExample code testcase.pyp  precodeimport sys  def myexcexctype, excvalue, exctraceback     Regular Python exception handler with inputs mirroring sys.excepthook      printnDoing Custom Stuff Python exc handlern      Call the old sys.excepthook as well     sys.excepthookexctype, excvalue, exctraceback  def imyexcshell, exctype, excvalue, exctb, tboffsetNone     IPythonic exception handler, following instructions in      setcustomexc here     httpipython.orgipythondocstableapigeneratedIPython.core.interactiveshell.html      printnDoing Custom Stuff iPython exc handlern      Do regular IPython stuff as well     shell.showtracebackexctype, excvalue, exctb, tboffsettboffset  try     IPYTHON     from IPython import getipython     shell  getipython     if shell         printShell Active          Set my custom exception handler for the current IPython shell         getipython.setcustomexcException,, imyexc     else         printIn IPython, but no active shell         sys.excepthook  myexc     except NameError     printNameError, falling back on regular Python way      use the standard python excepthook override     sys.excepthook  myexc  def makeproblem     10  makeproblem codepre  pBehaviorp  pWorks p  precode1.  ipython testcase.ipy  result shell active, Doing Custom Stuff iPython exc handler  2.  ipython cexecfiletestcase.py  result NameError, falling back on regular Python way, Doing Custom Stuff Python exc handler This one is particularly puzzling  3.  python testcase.py  result NameError, falling back on regular Python way, Doing Custom Stuff Python exc handler  4.  ipython In[0] execfiletestcase.py or In[0] paste pasting testcase.py      result shell active, Doing Custom Stuff iPython exc handler codepre  pDoesnt workp  precode1.  ipython testcase.py  result Shell Active, no override statement  2.  ipython c run testcase.py  result Shell Active, no override statement codepre  pthe run vs execfile behavior suggest to me that it has something to do with the script being run in a selfcontained namespace, but I havent been able to figure it out.

Negative 5210 pIn SQL Server when I am attempting to put data into a variable but have a ISNULL around the second left outer join value in the where statement instead of providing the expected result it only returns the last row of data.  In the example below you can see in much more detail what I mean.p  pThe first output will show you the generic output, 6 rows of data.  The second output will show you that I am only getting the last row of data in VAR.  The third output will show you that if I remove ISNULL from FRUITCOLORyellow.NAME in the Order by statement I get all 6 of rows concatenated together which is what I would think I would also get for the second output.p  pI want to understand why the second output is returning what it is.  What am I missingp  pReally I just want to know why VAR is different than VAR2.

Negative 5210 pMy problem is based on a real project problem, but I have never used the codeSystem.Threading.Taskscode library or performing any serious programming involving threads so my question may be a mix of lacking knowledge about the specific library and more general misunderstanding of what asynchronous really means in terms of programming.p  pSo my real world case is this  I need to fetch data about an user. In my current scenario its financial data so let say I need all codeAccountscode, all codeDepositscode and all codeConsignationscode for a certain user. In my case this means to query million of records for each property and each query is relatively slow itself, however to fetch the codeAccountscode is several times slower than fetching the codeDepositscode. So I have defined three classes for the three bank products Im going to use and when I want to fetch the data for all the bank products of certain user I do something like this p  precodeListltAccountgt accounts  GetAccountsForClientint clientId ListltDepositgt deposits  GetDepositsForClientint clientId ListltConsignationgt consignations  GetConsignationsForClientint clientId codepre  pSo the problem starts here I need to get all those three list at the same time, cause Im going to pass them to the view where I display all users data. But as it is right now the execution is synchronous If Im using the term correctly here so the total time for collecting the data for all three products isp  precodeTotalTime  TimeToGetAccounts  TimeToGetDeposits  TimeToGetConsignations codepre  pThis is not good because the each query is relatively slow so the total time is pretty big, but also, the codeaccountscode query takes much more time than the other two queries so the idea that get into my head today was  What if I could execute this queries simultaneously. Maybe here comes my biggest misunderstanding on the topic but for me the closest to this idea is to make them asynchronous so maybe then codeTotalTimecode wont be the time of the slowest query but yet will be much faster than the sum of all three queries.p  pSince my code is complicated I created a simple use case which I think, reflect what Im trying to do pretty well. I have two methods p  precodepublic static async Taskltintgt GetAccounts      int total1  0     using SqlConnection connection  new SqlConnectionconnString              string query1  SELECT COUNT FROM [MyDb].[dbo].[Accounts]         SqlCommand command  new SqlCommandquery1, connection         connection.Open         for int i  0 i lt 19000000 i                      string s  i.ToString                  total1  int await command.ExecuteScalarAsync         Console.WriteLinetotal1.ToString          return total1  codepre  pand the second method p  precodepublic static async Taskltintgt GetDeposits      int total2  0     using SqlConnection connection  new SqlConnectionconnString              string query2  SELECT COUNT FROM [MyDb].[dbo].[Deposits]         SqlCommand command  new SqlCommandquery2, connection         connection.Open         total2  int await command.ExecuteScalarAsync         Console.WriteLinetotal2.ToString          return total2  codepre  pwhich I call like this p  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args      Console.WriteLineGetAccounts.Result.ToString      Console.WriteLineGetDeposits.Result.ToString  codepre  pAs you can see I call codeGetAccountscode first and I slow the execution down on purpose so I give a chance the execution to continue to the next method. However Im not getting any result for a certain period of time and then I get all printed on the console at the same time.p  pSo the problem  how to make so that I dont wait for the first method to finish, in order to go to the next method. In general the code structure is not that important, what I really want to figure out is if theres any way to make both queries to execute at the same time. The sample here is the result of my research which maybe could be extended to the point where Ill get the desired result.p  pP.S Im using codeExecuteScalarAsynccode just because I started with a method which was using it. In reality Im gonna use codeScalarcode and codeReadercode.p

Negative 5210 pI write the application for a system with very limited RAM value. As application crash is always possible and it uses dynamic memory allocation, I created callbacks for all possible ways application can be stopped and clean up all buffers there, like sop  precodesigaddset  ampsigact.samask, SIGSEGV  sigaction  SIGSEGV, ampsigact,  struct sigaction  NULL  codepre  pIt triggers some notifying actions and tries to restart itself several times.

The edit icon I dont want displayed because they can just go to their profile and edit themselves that way anyway.

If you remove the calls to bounce and resize the window, the spot is moved instantly to the new sizelocation as it should be, but when you put the animation back in, it clearly isnt using this new transform data to interpolate the subsequent animation.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netfurroyo90neomw16 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netfurroyo90neomw16ap  precodevar snap var c  document.readyfunction      snap  new Snapscreen     c  snap.selectchar      ive refactored to make the jsfiddle easier to follow, but the effect is only really noticable       on startup now. you shouldnt see the red dot slide into place  it should just appear there and bounce.      the green dot isnt animated and appears in the right place instantly.  the red one is supposed to      only have the scale animated, not the move     positionCharacter       after simplifying the transform, you cant really tell whats going on with the resize now      window .resizefunction           when you resize the window, the move should be done instantaneously, and the bounce animation          from changing the scale should restart at the new location.  you shouldnt see the move animated.         positionCharacter         move the character and restart its bounce animation in the new location function positionCharacter      c.stop     c.transformbuildTransform1.0     moving it before animation starts, so you shouldt see the move happen     snap.selectorig.transformbuildTransform1.0       if you comment out this bounce you will see that it instantly moves to the correct location on      startup and resize before the bounce starts     bounce    animate the scale around a point to create a bounce effect function bounce      c.animate transform buildTransform1.0 , 250, mina.linear, function           c.animate transform buildTransform0.8 , 250, mina.linear, function              bounce                  function buildTransformvertScale      var t  new Snap.Matrix.translate100, 100.scale0.5, 0.5  vertScale     return t  codepre

Negative 5210 pHello generous SOers,p  pThis is a somewhat complicated question, but hopefully relevant to the more general use of global objects from a childmodule.p  pI am using some commercial software that provides a python library for interfacing with their application through TCP.  I cant post the code for their library I dont think.p  pI am having an issue with calling an object from a child module, that I think is more generally related to global variables or some such.  Basically, the objects state is as expected when the childmodule is in the same directory as all the other modules including the module that creates the object.br But when I move the offending child module into a subfolder, it can still access the object but the state appears to have been altered, and the objects connection to the commercial app doesnt work anymore.p  pFollowing some advice from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13034496usingglobalvariablesbetweenfilesinpythonthis questiona on global vars, I have organized my modules files as sop  precodescriptfile.py pyFIMM     init.py             imports all the other files     globals.py            creates the connection object used in most other modules     pyfimm.py             main module functions, such as pyFIMM.connect     Waveguide.py          there are many of these files with various classes and functions     ...other files...     PhotonDesignLib         init.py         imports all files in this folder         pdPythonLib.py      the commercial library     proprietary         init.py         imports all files in this folder         University.py       lt The offending childmodule with issues codepre  pcodepyFIMMinit.pycode imports the subfiles like sop  precodefrom globals import           import global vars amp create FimmWave connection object fimm from pyfimm import            import the main module from Waveguide import . ...import the other files... from proprietary import        imports the subfolder containing University.py codepre  pThe codeinit.pycodes in the subfolders emPhotonDesignLibem amp emproprietaryem both cause all files in the subfolders to imported, so, for example, codescriptfile.pycode would access my proprietary files as so codeimport pyFIMM.proprietary.Universitycode.  This is accomplished via a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1057431loadingallmodulesinafolderinpythonthis hinta, coded as follows in codeproprietaryinit.pycodep  precodeimport os, glob all  [ os.path.basenamef[3] for f in glob.globos.path.dirnamefile.py] codepre  pNumerous coders from a few different institutions will have their own proprietary code, so we can share the base code but keep our proprietary filesfunctions to ourselves this way, without having to change any base codeimport statements.  I now realize that, for the more static codePhotonDesignLibcode folder, this is overkill.p  pThe file codeglobals.pycode creates the object I need to use to communicate with their commercial app, with this code this is all the code in this filep  precodeimport PhotonDesignLib.pdPythonLib as pd     the commercial libobject global fimm fimm  pd.pdApp       lt  this is the offending global object codepre  pAll of my submodules contain a codefrom global import code statement, and are able to access the object codefimmcode without specifically declaring it as a codeglobalcode var, without any issue.  p  pSo I run codescriptfile.pycode, which has an import statement like codefrom pyFIMM import code. Most importantly, codescriptfile.pycode initiates the TCP connection made to the application via codefimm.connectcode right at the top, before issuing any commands that require the communication, and all the other modules call codefimm.Execltcommands for appgtcode in various routines, which has been working swimmingly well  the codefimmcode object has sofar been accessible to all modules, and keeps its connection state without issue.p  pstrongThe issue I am running into is that the file codeproprietaryUniversity.pycode can only successfully use the codefimmcode object when its placed in the pyFIMM rootlevel directory ie. the same folder as codeglobals.pycode etc..strong  But when codeUniversity.pycode is imported from within the codeproprietarycode subfolder, it gives me an emapplication not initializedem error when I use the codefimmcode object, as if the object had been overwritten or reinitialized or something.  The object still exists, it just isnt maintaining its connection state when called by this submodule.  Ive checked that its not reinitialized in another module.p  pIf, after the script fails in codeproprietaryUniversity.pycode, I use the console to send a command eg. codepyFimm.fimm.Execltcommand to appgtcode, emit communicates just fineembr I set codeproprietaryUniversity.pycode to print a codedirfimmcode as a test right at the beginning, which works fine and looks like the codefimmcode object exists as expected, but a subsequent call in the same file to codefimm.Execcode indicates that the objects state is not correct, returning the emapplication not initializedem error.br This almost looks like there are two codefimmcode objects  one that the main python console and pyFIMM modules see, which works great, and another that codeproprietaryUniversity.pycode sees which doesnt know that we called codefimm.connectcode already.  Again, if I put codeUniversity.pycode in the main module folder empyFIMMem it works fine  the codefimm.Execcode calls operate as expectedp  pFYI codeproprietaryUniversity.pycode imports the codeglobals.pycode file as sop  precodeimport sys, os, inspect ScriptDir  inspect.currentframe.fcode.cofilename    get path to this module file ParentDir , tail  os.path.splitScriptDir        split off toplevel directory from path ParentDir , tail  os.path.splitParentDir        split off toplevel directory from path sys.path.appendParentDir         add ParentDir to the python search path  from globals import           import global vars amp FimmWave connection object  global fimm          This line makes no difference, was just trying it. codepre  pFYI, Somewhere on SO it was stated that codeinspectcode was better than codefilecode, hence the code above.p  pstrongWhy do you think having the submodule in a subfolder causes the object to lose its statestrongp  pI suspect the issue is either the way I instruct codeUniversity.pycode to import codeglobals.pycode or the import all files in this folder method I used in codeproprietaryinit.pycode.  But I have little idea how to fix itp  pThank you for looking at this question, and thanks in advance for your insightful comments.p

Negative 5210 pIm using blueimps fileupload javascript  widget and jQuery 1.9.0 for uploading files to a server and I have an event not being triggered in IE8, which is one of the required browsers for my project.p  pSo because of this I can never open the window for browsing for the files. If I do a fileupload.click from the IE8 console, it works, but I didnt success in the code.p  pI think this is happening because of the bubbling of the event, but Im showing you the code for deciding for yourselves. I think also that styles are importante to this issue because maybe the styled button Im using over the real fileupload widget must be overlapping it. Maybe css styles like opacity and position matter.p  pHtmlp  precodeltform idsupportFormgt     ltdiv classformTablegt         ltdiv classformRowgt             ltlabelgtUserltlabelgt             ltinput nameuser typetext classformcontrol validate[required] placeholderJohn Smithgt         ltdivgt          ltdiv classformRowgt             ltlabelgtPhoneltlabelgt             ltinput namephone typetel classformcontrol validate[required] placeholderEj 881243989gt         ltdivgt          lt ... gt         lt Some inputs and stuff gt         lt ... gt          ltdiv classformRowgt             ltlabelgtAttached filesltlabelgt             ltdiv classformCellgt                 ltspan classbtn btndefault fileinputbuttongt                     ltspangtBrowseltspangt                     ltinput idfileupload typefile namefiles[] dataurl..serverupload.html classsubmitFilesButton multiplegt                 ltspangt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classformRowgt             ltlabelgtltlabelgt             ltdiv idadditional classformCellgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classformRowgt             ltlabelgtltlabelgt             ltdiv classformCellgt                 ltbutton idremedyButton typesubmit classbtn btnprimarygtSendltbuttongt                 ltbutton idresetButton typereset classbtn btndefaultgtCleanltbuttongt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltformgt codepre  pJavascriptp  precodedocument.readyfunction      uploadcomp  fileupload             .fileupload  Widget options                 singleFileUploads  false,                 autoUpload  false,                 dataType  json                          .onfileuploadadd,                 functione, data   Function for adding files after opening the browse window                     if data.files.length gt 0                          input[typefile].csscolor, transparent                                            Creating divs for the selected files in the previous browse window                     for  var i  0 i lt data.files.length i                          var name  ltdivgtltdivgt.textdata.files[i].name                         var icon  ltspan classfa fa2x fatrash datatoggletooltip dataplacementbottom titleDeletegt                         icon.clickfunction                               This handler creates a button for removing the actual file                             for  var k  0 k lt fileList.length k                                  if fileList[k].name  this.parent.text                                      fileList.splicek, 1                                     break                                                                                           this.parent.remove                                                   fileDiv  ltdiv classitemgt.wrapInnername.appendicon                         fileDiv.appendToadditional                         fileList.pushdata.files[i]                                          createTooltip.fatrash                       if isNavigatorCONSTANTS.BROWSER.IE8           Maybe could use something here and force the click          But my current solution creates an infinite loop       codepre  pCssp  precode These are specifically for IE8 and are located in ie8.css  DIV.formRow gt       width auto   INPUT[typefile]      display  none    These are for all browsers in another css file, also for IE8 when there is no rule in the previous file   .formTable      borderspacing1em     display table     width 45em     minwidth45em     margin 0 auto   div.formRow      display tablerow   div.formRow gt label, additional      width 35   div.formRow gt       display tablecell     width 100   div.formCell      display tablecell     width 100   fileupload      floatleft     top 0     right 0     left 0     margin 0     position absolute     width 100     height 100     padding initial   .item      border 1px     bordercolor black     borderstyle solid     borderradius 5px     borderwidth thin     display inlineblock     padding 4px     margin0.25em   .item div      verticalaligntextbottom     display inline   .fatrash      marginleft 1em     cursorpointer     color 428BCA   company      display inlineblock     width 49   warehouse      floatright     width 49     display inlineblock   .submitFilesButton      opacity0     positionabsolute   .fileinputbutton      textaligncenter     whitespace nowrap     position relative        resetButton, remedyButton      margin 0.4em     floatright   label      verticalaligntop  codepre
Negative 5210 pI have set up JBoss 7.1.1Final in domain mode with 1 master amp 1 slave instances. Apache HTTPD is at the front end providing fail over  load balancing. Session replication is set up amp working fine. p  pUsing Spring 3, I have injected one of the cache defined in domain.xml into a class provided by me. The purpose is to disallow concurrent login through the same user ID. For JBoss instances with sticky sessions, Spring provided SessionRegistryImpl works fine. But in cluster mode with non sticky sessions, a custom class ClusterAwareSessionRegistryImpl is implemented which is same as SessionRegistryImpl but instead of using local Maps it uses the injected cache with replication. Putting application specific class objects into the cache works and no exception is thrown. But when the cache is accessed for the objects on another jboss node then deserialzation results in ClassNotFoundException. From the exception it looks like that the application specific classes are not visible to  JBoss classloader. Searched amp tried a lot but I am unable to make this work. Setting cache with the classloader didnt work or maybe I missed something i.e. org.infinispan.Cache.getAdvancedCache.withthis.getClass.ClassLoaderp  pKindly point me in the right direction.p

Negative 5210 pI am working on a project which requires me to render a virtual character onto the kinect video feed in which the player appears.p  pI am attempting to use Unity3D to accomplish this. I have looked at Zigfu but I dont think this directly helps. I still want to be able to send data from my C WPF program to the game engine I am forking my project off from kinect Fusion Explorer.

Negative 5210 pI have a chunk of code using POSIX APIs to talk to a device which is essentially a cp210x USBtoserial device.p  pThe code does work, but I had to install a kernel extension to make it happen. Now, I dont want to install a kext. This devices engineers have used a nonstandard vendor ID and product ID for their device, so the proper driver for it doesnt notice that it will work. Therefore, I have to edit the Info.plist for the kext, or make my own codeless kext, but either way I will have to get a kernel extension signed, which seems like a pain in the butt I remember it was a huge ordeal just to get the right certificate to sign an appp  pSo basically, I was able to get it to work, but only after turning off kext signature checks globally, which is not something I want to do.p  pNow, I have another chunk of code which uses IOKit to query the USB devices for a device which matches a given vendor ID and product ID and can show a bunch of properties about it.p  pIs there some way I can use IOKit, then, to open a serial connection to a USBtoserial device, without having to install a kext Maybe this chip is sufficiently generic that there is a proper way to do it already in OSX USBtoserial isnt exactly new technology.p

Negative 5210 pAre there any disadvantages to using a single instance of a grails command object across multiple actionsp  pI.E. you have a several pages with forms in a process and thus create a single grails command object class and only use a single instance of the class throughout the process.p  pPresume the instance is stored in the flow of a webflow, thus accessible throughout the process, and when validate is called its provided with a list of properties to validate instead of validating all the properties.  The command object properties are populated like obj.property1  params.property1 not with bindData or as a parameter.p  pIs this a good fit for a grails command object or should a command object for each form be createdp  pEdit I guess what Im looking for is a ProCon list of using one command object for one entire process with multiple forms vs. multiple command objects.p

First I create the toolbar and add my custom view.p  precode    ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt     ltandroid.support.v7.widget.Toolbar         xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid         xmlnsapphttpschemas.android.comapkresauto         androidididtoolbaractionbar         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightdimenmindoubletoolbarheight         appthemestyleThemeOverlay.AppCompat.ActionBar         androidminHeightattractionBarSize         androidbackgroundcolorprimary          appcontentInsetStart0dp         appcontentInsetEnd0dp         appcontentInsetLeft0dp         appcontentInsetRight0dp         androidclipToPaddingfalse         gt         lt ThemeOVerlay Makes sure the text and items are using solid colorsgt          ltinclude             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheight72dp             androidlayoutgravitybottom             layoutlayoutdaynavigationtab             gt      ltandroid.support.v7.widget.Toolbargt codepre  pdaynavigationtab is just a horizontal  with Two image views with Padding of 72dp as by guidelines and a text view with layout weight set to 1 so it stretches for the whole available space.

Negative 5210 pIm studying on socket programming, and server socket codeacceptcode is confusing me. I wrote two scenarios for server socket codeacceptcode, please take a lookp  ol liWhen server socket do codeacceptcode, it creates a new client socket that is bind to port that is strongdifferentstrong from the port server socket is bind. So socket communication is done via newly bind port, and server socket for codeacceptcode only is waiting for another client connection on originally bind port.li ol  pI think this is not quite proper answer because 1 port matches to a single process and 2 socket accept is insideprocess matters, and single process can have multiple sockets. So I made second scenario, based on some of stackoverflow answersp  ol start2 liWhen server socket do codeacceptcode, it creates a new client socket that is strongnotstrong bind to any specific port, and when client communicates with the server, it uses strongthe portstrong that is bind to server socket who codeacceptcodes connections and strongwhich client socketstrong to actually communicate is resolved by codesourceIP, sourcePort, destIP, destPortcode tuple from TCP header at Transmission level This is also suspicious because I thought socket is somewhat applicationlevel objectli ol  pThis scenario also raises some questions. If the socket communications still use server sockets port, i.e. client sends some messages to server socket port, doesnt it uses server sockets backlog queue I mean, how can messages from client be distinguished between codeconnectcode and coderead or writecode And how can they be resolved to each client sockets in server, WITHOUT any port bindingp  pIf one of my scenario is correct, would answer to the questions following Or possibly Im making two wrong scenarios, so It would be very thankful for you to provide right answers, or at least some relevant texts to study.p

After clearing and adding the second mock, codegetRegisteredMockModulescode shows only the second mock, however it seems like the first mock is still getting used, based on the codeexpectcodes and manual inspection when using codebrowser.pausecode with ChromeDriver. It seems that you cant change the mocks without at least reloading the page.p  p2 Even if it did work, there is a huge amount of repeated code for each mock module, as it has to set up everything, including the codepassThroughcode.p  pWhat would be even better would be if I could pass my desired response into the mock I am adding, however I tried that and anything passed into my own function isnt available within the codeangular.modulecode scope. The only way I could think of to do that would be to create another angular module with a provider that had a single variable that would keep track of which response was desired, and inject that into the mocked module. I havent tried that yet but it seems like an unnecessarily complex solution.p

Negative 5210 pI have a file separated by semicolons and I need to read this file by parts and so Im using readlinesemkem, where emkem is a buffer size chosen. The piece of code below not exactly return the emkem quantity required because each line could not have the same length of bytes case of csv files. Something like that p  precodeBUFFERSIZE  1024  fopenfile,r chuncktmp  f.readlinesBUFFERSIZE codepre  pIn this point emchuncktmpem is an list and I would like to discover the exact number of bytes inside it. The problem is that now the information has another format including spaces, brackets and something else to consider if I try something like stremchuncktmpem and so the number of bytes would be greater than real quantity of bytes inside of emchuncktmpem if I try evaluate it with lenstremchuncktmpem.

Negative 5210 pI am developing an embedded system on a PowerPC processor and there is need for communication with an FPGA via PCIe. I wish to use LinuxembeddedLinux as a bootloader to leverage its PCIe initialization code and driver API for simplified PCIe driver development. However in the end I want to be running baremetal code no OS running. So I am looking at using PetitBootkexec to jump from Linux to my own code.p  pIs this possiblep  pMy current understanding of PCIe drivers leads me to believe that once the device is initialized, so long as I have a pointer to the address space, I should be able to simply execute MMIO RW operations directly to the memory space. So even if kexec overwrites the driver code I should be able to use the device because the driver has done its job already.p  pIs this correctp  pIf not, what are my alternativesp

Negative 5210 pIm following the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationjavascriptexamplespolygonarrays relnofollowexamplea for creating Polygon Arrays with the Google Maps API. I want to create multiple polygons that each have a different name when you click on them. In the code below, I want the first triangle to be called name 1 when you click it and the second triangle to be called name 2 when you click it. I attempted to do this, but they are both called name 2 when you click on them.

Negative 5210 pOne question about strongclosurestrong vs strongrelationstrong database logic. What I need to understand is when to choose one logic and when to choose better another logic. Any links, tips, texts, documentations will be really appreciated.p  pClosure table Examplep  pI got table strongcarsstrong and table strongcarclosurestrong. Basically the logic is that I have one car in table car, for example, Audi with id  1.

And in carclosure table I have strongancestorstrong  1id, because its the same Audi, but with stronglevelstrong  2hierarchy level, so it means that, when I query this information again from car table, I will use column strongdescendantstrong with ids in 77, 99, 190. p  blockquote   pselect descendant from strongcarclosurestrong where ancestor  1 and level  1   It will return descendant ids what will be 77, 99, 190.p      pSelect name from strongcarstrong where id in 1, 77, 99, 190   Result set will be name Audi, 1.5 TDi, 1.6 Tds, 2.4 Dp blockquote  pWhy to choose such a approach Any ideas  Pros  Cons p  pIf we can easily just create to different tables, for example, car and modeltype And use simple relations between them.p

For the sake of an example, I will explain based on a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.dockpanelvvs.110.aspxcodeDockPanelcodea, though I would like to know how to do this generally, based on any kind of codePanelcode.p  pTo reuse the layouting logic, I am intending to add a codeDockPanelcode as a visual child in my panel, which will then hold and layout the logical children of my panel.p  pI have tried three different ideas on how to solve this, and another one was suggested in a comment, but each of them so far fails at a different pointp  hr  pstrong1 Introduce the inner layout panel in a control template for the custom panelstrongp  pThis seems like the most elegant solution  this way, a control panel for the custom panel could feature an a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.itemscontrol28vvs.11029.aspxcodeItemsControlcodea whose a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.itemscontrol.itemspanelvvs.110.aspxcodeItemsPanelcode propertya is uses a codeDockPanelcode, and whose a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.itemscontrol.itemssourcevvs.110.aspxcodeItemsSourcecode propertya is bound to the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.panel.children28vvs.11029.aspxcodeChildrencode propertya of the custom panel.p  pUnfortunately, a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.panel28vvs.11029.aspxcodePanelcodea does not inherit from a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.control28vvs.11029.aspxcodeControlcodea and hence does not have a a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.control.template28vvs.11029.aspxcodeTemplatecode propertya, nor feature support for control templates.p  pOn the other hand, the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.panel.children28vvs.11029.aspxcodeChildrencode propertya is introduced by codePanelcode, and hence not present in codeControlcode, and I feel it could be considered hacky to break out of the intended inheritance hierarchy and create a panel that is actually a codeControlcode, but not a codePanelcode.p  hr  pstrong2 Provide a children list of my panel that is merely a wrapper around the children list of the inner panelstrongp  pSuch a class looks as depicted below.

This emmightem be partially fixed by invoking a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.namescope.registernamevvs.100.aspxcodeRegisterNamecodea for each child, but one would need to retrieve the correct codeNameScopecode instance. Also, I am not sure whether the behaviour when, for instance, the name of a child changes would be the same as in other panels.p  pInstead, setting the codeNameScopecode of the inner panel seems to be the way to go. I tried this with a straightforward binding in the codeTestPanel1code constructorp  precode        BindingOperations.SetBindinginnerPanel,                                      NameScope.NameScopeProperty,                                      new BindingNameScope.NameScope                                          Source  this                                       codepre  pUnfortunately, this just sets the codeNameScopecode of the inner panel to codenullcode. As far as I could find out by means of a hrefhttpssnoopwpf.codeplex.comSnoopa, the actual codeNameScopecode instance is only stored in the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms60118328vvs.10029.aspxcodeNameScopecode attached propertya of either the parent window, or the root of the enclosing visual tree defined by a control template or possibly by some other key node, no matter what type. Of course, a control instance may be added and removed at different positions in a control tree during its lifetime, so the relevant codeNameScopecode might change from time to time. This, again, calls for a binding.p  pThis is where I am stuck again, because unfortunately, one cannot define a a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.data.relativesource28vvs.10029.aspxcodeRelativeSourcecodea for the binding based on an arbitrary condition such as the first encountered node that has a noncodenullcode value assigned to the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms60118328vvs.10029.aspxcodeNameScopecode attached propertya.p  pUnless a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31187522capturechangeinsurroundingvisualtreethis other question about how to react to updates in the surrounding visual treea yields a useful response, is there a better way to retrieve andor bind to the codeNameScopecode currently relevant for any given framework elementp  hr  pstrong3 Use an inner panel whose children list is simply the same instance as that of the outer panelstrongp  pRather than keeping the child list in the inner panel and forwarding calls to the outer panels child list, this works kindof the other way round.

However, the controls are not clickable.p  pI suspect I have to somehow forward calls to a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms59891428vvs.11029.aspxcodeHitTestCoreGeometryHitTestParameterscodea and to a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms59891528vvs.11029.aspxcodeHitTestCorePointHitTestParameterscodea to the inner panel. However, in the inner panel, I can only access a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.uielement.inputhittest28vvs.11029.aspxcodeInputHitTestcodea, so I am neither sure how to safely process the raw a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.media.hittestresult28vvs.11029.aspxcodeHitTestResultcodea instance without losing or ignoring any of the information that the original implementation would have respected, nor how to process the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.media.geometryhittestparameters28vvs.11029.aspxcodeGeometryHitTestParameterscodea, as codeInputHitTestcode only accepts a simple a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.pointvvs.110.aspxcodePointcodea.p  pMoreover, the controls are also not focusable, e.g. by pressing kbdTabkbd. I do not know how to fix this.p  pBesides, I am slightly wary of going this way, as I am not sure what internal links between the inner panel and the original list of children I am breaking by replacing that list of children with a custom object.p  hr  pstrong4 Inherit directly from panel classstrongp  pUser a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1136211clemensClemensa suggests to directly have my class inherit from a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.dockpanel28vvs.11029.aspxcodeDockPanelcodea. However, there are two reasons why that is not a good ideap  ul liThe current version of my panel will rely on the layouting logic of codeDockPanelcode. However, it is possible that at some point in the future, that will not be enough any more and someone will indeed have to write custom layouting logic in my panel. In that case, replacing an inner codeDockPanelcode with custom layouting code is trivial, but removing codeDockPanelcode from the inheritance hierarchy of my panel would mean a breaking change.li liIf my panel inherits from a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.dockpanel28vvs.11029.aspxcodeDockPanelcodea, users of the panel might be able to sabotage its layouting code by messing around with properties exposed by codeDockPanelcode, in particular a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.dockpanel.lastchildfill28vvs.11029.aspxcodeLastChildFillcodea. And while it is just that property, I would like to use an approach that works with all a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.panel28vvs.11029.aspxcodePanelcodea subtypes. For instance, a custom panel derived from a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.grid28vvs.11029.aspxcodeGridcodea would expose the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.grid.columndefinitions28vvs.11029.aspxcodeColumnDefinitionscodea and a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.grid.rowdefinitions28vvs.11029.aspxcodeRowDefinitionscodea properties, by which any automatically generated layout could be completely destroyed via the public interface of the custom panel.li ul  hr  pAs a test case for observing the described issues, add an instance of the custom panel being tested in XAML, and within that element, add the followingp  precodeltTextBox Nametb1 DockPanel.DockRightgt ltTextBlock TextBinding Text, ElementNametb1 DockPanel.DockLeftgt codepre  pThe text block should be left of the text box, and it should show whatever is currently written in the text box.p  pI would expect the text box to be clickable, and the output view not to display any binding errors so, the binding should work, as well.p  hr  pThus, my question isp  ul listrongCan any one of my attempts be fixed to lead to a completely correct solution Or is there a completely other way that is preferrable to what I have tried to do what I am looking forstrongli ul

Perhaps something like codesendSerializer.convertdatacode  where data is my emPlayerem object that is converted into either String or byte[] which is the expected argument of the native send method that is compatible with GWT.p  pAs always, thanks for any help you can provide.p

The boxvm was setup over a decade ago and the people whoever set it up left absolutely no documentationevidence, trace, email or whatsoever for the current IT department to refer to, and ITS assumed the server is running linux.p  ol start2 liThe IT department is too lazy to run through all the boxes they have in the underground server room and refused to helpli liPolitical reasons which I have no idea what it is as I have just joined the company, this is also the reason I have been assigned with such task to find the physical vmware host machines nameIP because others just would not like to talk to the IT guys or the boss about it.li ol  pWhat I can possibly get from the IT department Both Dev and Production machines IP, and possibly remote access as administrator.p  pWhat I need By accessing the server mentioned above, either dev or production, assuming they are workstation created using vmware, find the vmware host machines IP or name.p  pHope I have explained myself clearly here. Any input is appreciated.p

Can someone help on thisemp  blockquote   pstrongLong versionstrong SplitViewController behaviourp      pNormally a split view controller and a navigation controller work   together to ensure that a call to showDetailViewControllersender   from a view controller that is contained within the split view   controller results in the new detail view controller being pushed onto   the navigation stack when in a horizontally compact environment.  To   do this, UISplitViewController overrides   showDetailViewControllersender and, if horizontally compact, calls its master view controllers showViewControllersender method.    UINavigationController overrides showViewControllersender and   pushes the incoming view controller onto the navigation stack.  p      pUITabBarController however does not override   showViewControllersender and so it inherits the default implementation which presents the incoming view controller modally.    To work around this I have to subclass UITabBarController and override   showViewControllersender to forward to the tab bar controllers selectedViewController if the selectedViewController is a navigation   controller. p      pFurthermore, when a split view controller transitions from a compact   to horizontal size class to a regular horizontal size class, the split   view controller first sends a   splitViewControllerseparateSecondaryViewControllerFromPrimaryViewController   message to its delegate.  The delegate can implement this method and   handle the separation itself, returning the detail view controller.    If the delegate does not implement this method, or if the   implementation returns nil, the split view controller sends a   separateSecondaryViewControllerForSplitViewController message to its primary view controller.  The primary view controller should implement   this method to handle the separation. The UINavigationController does   implement separateSecondaryViewControllerForSplitViewController.    Its implementation pops the top view controller off the navigation   stack and returns it.  Because I am using a tab bar controller as the   primary view controller, I must implement   separateSecondaryViewControllerForSplitViewController and handle the separation by myself.p      pAlso I need to implement my own collapsing logic. When a split view   controller transitions from a regular to horizontal size class to a   compact horizontal size class, the split view controller first sends a   splitViewControllercollapseSecondaryViewControllerontoPrimaryViewController   message to its delegate.  The delegate can implement this method and   handle the collapse itself.  If the delegate does not implement this   method, the split view controller sends a   collapseSecondaryViewControllerforSplitViewController message to its primary view controller.  The primary view controller should   implement this method to handle the separation.p      pUINavigationController does implement   collapseSecondaryViewControllerforSplitViewController.  Its implementation pushes the secondary view controller onto the   navigation stack.  Because I am using a tab bar controller as the   primary view controller, I must implement   collapseSecondaryViewControllerforSplitViewController and handle the collapse by myself.p blockquote
Negative 5210 pIm currently creating an application in C that allows you to create a server and manage it easily, to do this it uses batch files to run said servers.

Negative 5210 pQuestion 1 Where I currently work we are not able to use Maven in any way due to restrictions on the internetconnection. Were also not able to set up our own NexusArchive instance as none of the servers will have internet connection  so, Maven is unfortunally off the table.p  pSo, this means were then stuck with Ant as the primary build system. This itself isnt that bad, as were having quite a nifty solution set up in regards to the Ant scripts etc. But, for building embedded web applications that use several technologies, things get a bit tough.p  pWere having this basic setup of componentsp  ul liJetty 9.3.xli liSpring 4.xli liHibernate 5.xli liCXF 3.xli ul  p..and some other stuff.p  pIf we were dealing with Maven projects, there wouldve been a nice solution already available by using the mavenshadeplugin defined with a few filters. Anyway, when using Ant, there are, a few possibilities. These allows you to create a fatjar similar to that of the Shadepluginp  ul liJarJarli liOneJarli liFatJarli ul  pThese work all and fine, however, there is one rather big issue that is similar to all of them  when building a fat JAR, the configuration related to the xmlfiles will not be appended to one big file containing all configuration.

However, this does not happen with the OneJarplugins etc. Ive tried writing some stuff that extending this, but it seems to be quite some work to be done in order to solve this.p  pSo, before actually continuing with an attempt to do something similar with Ant, I must ask here first. p  pHave someone successfully created an Antprofile that creates the followingp  ul liExecutable JAR with an embedded Jetty, Spring andor CXFli ul  pEmbedded JAR here relates to the possibility to execute a similar commandp  precodejava jar Dltpropertiesgt ltjarfilegt ltportnumbergt ltoperationgt java jar Dwhatever myCoolJarFile.jar 10000 start codepre  pIf Im somewhat unclear on what Im trying to achieve, let me know.p  pQuestion 2 Could it be that it is wise to use Gradle with the Shadowlike plugin insteadp  pRegards,p

Negative 5210 pI am building a MEAN stack application, and for authenticationauthorization I basically followed the recommendations of scotch.ios MEAN Machine book. So, I am using JWTs and attaching them to every request from the client via http interceptor. However, one of the features of the application is a google map that plots various points relevant to the user, and Im running a function in the map controller that geocodes citystate values from a list and drops them on the map.p  pThis had been working fine until yesterday, when I began to see the following error in the consolep  precodeXMLHttpRequest cannot load httpsmaps.googleapis.commapsapigeocodejsonaddressREADING,PAampkeyltAPIKEYgt. Request header field Authorization is not allowed by AccessControlAllowHeaders. codepre  pI set up the interceptor in my app.configp  precodehttpProvider.interceptors.pushAuthInterceptor   codepre  pI was initially using the request header codexaccesstokencode as used in the book, but was getting the same error. I changed to codeAuthorizationcode, thinking that it might be more commonly accepted. But that didnt work. So I thought the best approach might be to conditionally add the request header to any request thats not going to maps.googleapis.com p  precodeapp.factoryAuthInterceptor, [q, AuthToken, functionq, AuthToken     var interceptorFactory       attach the token to every HTTP request   interceptorFactory.request  functionconfig         have tried a couple conditional statements to avoid       attaching the Authorization header to google maps requests      if config.url.substr8, 19  maps.googleapis.com       if .startsWithconfig.url, httpsmaps.googleapis.com         grab the token       var token  AuthToken.getToken        if the token exists, add it to the header as Authorization       if token           config.headers[Authorization]  token                 return config       ...   return interceptorFactory  ]   codepre  pBut neither of the conditional statements has worked. Am I thinking about this the right way Am I correct in assuming that this is the source of the error, and that it should be possible to leave the codeAuthorizationcode header off of the request if the request meets certain criteria, or is that not the way that AngularJS interceptors work p  pAny advice would be much appreciated Thanks.p  pUPDATE I neglected to include the second parenthesis after the codeif .startsWithconfig.url, httpsmaps.googleapis.comcode.

Negative 5210 pI have a Compute engine on google cloud with 4 core CPU Ivy Brigde and 15 GB RAM and on that I have deployed my rails application.p  pBefore this I had hosted my rails application on digital ocean and there I was getting good throughput and also the cpu and memory consumption was minimal. It never crossed 3 GB memory consumption on Digital ocean and the CPU consumption max was around 50  55. On Digital Ocean I had a single instance with 4 core CPU and 8GB RAM and even I was running mysql,redis and sidekiq on the same instance and still it could handle the load easily.p  pBut as I moved to google cloud I started facing the problems for the same code. Actually I was expecting more throughput from the Google cloud as Google has data centers in Asia, but I started facing issue. When I restart apache everything comes back to normal and again after 2  3 hours it goes on consuming memeory and CPU and finally instance stops responding to the requests anymore.p  pI checked the logs..... and there are no much increase in traffic, also I cheked logs during the load time to ensure whether someone is attacking the servers. But all the request I found are from a valid browsers with valid user agents.p  pI dont understand why is this happening. First I felt if it is a DDOSDOS attack but dint find anything suspicious in the log apache access logs and rails logs.p  pPlease help me.

exception issue wasnt resolved, and thanks to the MongoDB Java Driver 3.0s new features, I have decided to move off from Morphia to MongoDBJavaDriver3.0MJD3.0p  phr On inspecting Documents empreviously stored by morphiaem I can seep  precodeid  ObjectId55706df5e4b00146ea69622b, className  packageName.NewsCategory, categoryName  Maritime, uid  NumberLong11, createdAt

where values are being read from the fields as strongcodenewsCategory.idcodestrong, strongcodenewsCategory.categoryNamecodestrong, strongcodenewsCategory.createdAtcodestrong e.gp  precodelta hrefnewscategoriesnewsCategory.idgt Edit ltagt codepre  pNow, because strongemI do not want to modify the Servelet andor View Layeremstrong, I ensure that in the business Layer, the codejsoncode string gets deserialized into the corresponding Model using codegsoncodep  pcodeNewsCategory newsCategory  new GsonBuilder.create.fromJsonjson, NewsCategory.classcodep  phr strongCHALLENGE  1strongp  pWith codedocumentcode Type being codeorg.bson.Documentcode and using MongoDBJavaDriver3.0 MJD3.0, The strongcodeNewsCategorycodestrong document is correctly retrieved from MongoDB, no problem, and when I call p  pcodeString json  document.toJsoncode ...heres what the json structure looks like p  precode     id          oid 54ad4568e451500a45f60200     ,     className packageName.NewsCategory,

PROBLEMstrong p  pThis codejsoncode structure derived from codedocument.toJsoncode cannot be easily deserialized to the corresponding strongcodeNewsCategorycodestrong model using my earlier described strategy, thanks to those field types present in the format.p  phr strongCHALLENGE  2strongp  pI directly converted the codedocumentcode to json using codegsoncode as followsp  pcodeString json  new GsonBuilder.create.toJsondocumentcode ...and heres what the json structure looks likep  precode     id          timestamp 1420641640,         machineIdentifier 14963024,         processIdentifier

true  codepre  pThis is way more desirable, and I can get the strongcodeNewsCategorycodestrong object using my usual strategy asp  pcodeNewsCategory newsCategory  new GsonBuilder.create.fromJsonjson, NewsCategory.classcodep  phr strongANOTHER PROBLEM THOUGHstrongp  pThe codeidcode field has been broken into its codeObjectIdcode components, hence the id cannot be retrieved as codenewsCategory.idcode or even codenewsCategory.idcode. p  pHowever while I was formerly using morphia, it could simply be retrieved by just using codenewsCategory.idcodep  phr strongMAIN QUESTIONSstrongp  pWhat is the appropriate way to deserialize these json strings into the corresponding strongcodeNewsCategorycodestrong Model while still ensuring that all the necessary fields are still normally accessible in the Views using the regular dot. annotations strongemespecially that codeidcode fieldemstrongp  pAn approach for both strongCHALLENGES 1 amp 2strong described above would be highly appreciated.p  pThanksp  pstrongemEDITemstrong p  pIve tried cichystefans approach and the challenge still remains how to access the value of the codeidcode field p  pWith codenewsCategorycode now being of type codeorg.bson.Documentcode, for quite obvious reasons, codenewsCategory.idcode is apparently either empty or null, because when I inspect an html section in the view defined as codelta hrefnewscategoriesnewsCategory.idgtcode in google chrome heres what I see... codelta hrefnewscategoriesgtcode... p  pNow, instinct says to fetch the codeidcode part by doing codenewsCategory.idcode but this just spills the whole document as a string and appends the code.idcode part at the end of the string. p  pcodelta hrefnewscategoriesDocumentid54ad4568e451500a45f60200,

Negative 5210 pIm trying to learn cakephp 3 and the ORM functions, wicht is great so far. But know Im comming to a point on wich Im not certain how I can aproach it in the best way, so I was hoping that somebody can tell what is the best way.p  pIm using the query builder to load one or more products. In the data thats loaded I have one field called price. This is the main price of the product, but there can be an optional discount for an user. I know wich user is logged in to the system so I have an variabele witch contains his discount, for example 1.20 20.p  pAfter the query has been fired I could do an foreach and recalculate the price before sending is to the view, but because of the query builder function I suspect that I can do it there before I fired the query.p  pBelow an example where an search is done on input name.

Negative 5210 pFrom what Ive understood, tracking algorithms predict where a given object will be in the next frame after object detection is already performed. The object is then again recognized in the next frame. What isnt clear is how the tracker then knows to associate the object in the 2nd frame as the same as the one in the 1st, especially when there are multiple objects in the frame.p  pIve seen in a few places that a cost matrix is created using Euclidean distance between the prediction and all detections, and the problem is framed as an assignment problem Hungarian algorithm.p  pIs my understanding of tracking correct Are there other ways of establishing that an object in one frame is the same as an object in the next framep

Negative 5210 pstrongIs anyone else seeing the following bug on M preview 3strongp  pInducing a proximity sensor event right after registering a proximity listener with the sensor manager will cause the sensor to becomes frozen. I.e. if you register a proximity sensor listener with sensor manager while your hand is on the proximity sensor, and very quickly after this you remove your hand, the proximity sensor will not report that there is now nothing in proximity, and will remain with a status of in proximity until the listener is unregistered and reregistered. This can happen across different apps. I.e. if you reproduce this in one app, all apps will report a frozen proximity value. I first noticed this in my app which happens to register and unregister the proximity listener on a regular basis, providing a higher than usual chance of this happening. p  ul lipWhich version of the SDK are you usingp  p23pli lipWhich Android build are you using e.g. MPA44Gp  pMPA44Ipli lipWhat device are you usingp  pNexus 5pli lipWhat steps will reproduce the problem Please provide the minimal reproducible test case.p  p1 This is fairly easy to reproduce with an app available on the market. Download the app Sensor Kinetics SK. It reports various different sensors and their readings. Here is the link a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.innoventions.sensorkinetics relnofollowhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.innoventions.sensorkineticsap  p2 Open SK and find the proximity sensor reading. Note what the reading is when something is covering the proximity sensor ex. 0.0cm and when nothing is covering the proximity sensor ex. 5.0cm. Leave SK open with the proximity reading in view.p  p3 Turn the screen off. p  p4 Turn the screen on should be at the lock screen at this point.p  p5 Cover the proximity sensor.p  p6 Unlock the screen.p  p7 As soon as the phone is unlocked, very quickly uncover the proximity sensor.p  p8 Repeat steps 37 as the timing for step 7 is tricky to get right try at least 10 times. pli lipWhat is the expected outputp  pThe expected output is for the proximity reading to go from inproximity to outofproximity ex. 0.0cm to 5.0cm once the proximity sensor is quickly uncovered in step 7 above.pli lipWhat do you see insteadp  pThe proximity reading remains on inproximity ex. 0.0cm from here on out, no matter if the proximity sensor is covered, uncovered, or recovered. The reading is only reset once the screen is turned off again the proximity listener is unregistered at this point.pli ul  pI have logged a bug report on Googles group below as well.
