Positive 9993 pI must create a sales tracking program named SalesTracking.java. This program will use arrays to store and process monthly sales as well as compute average yearly sales, total sales for the year, and which month had the highest sales and which month had the lowest sales.  I should use parallel arrays. First array monthArray should be initialized with all of the months. This array should have 12 locations of course. Other array should be named monthlySales. Like monthArray, this array should be 12 locations that store the amount of sales for each month.p  pThe program should prompt the user for the sales for each month starting with January. The arrays monthlySales and monthArray should be created in main and passed to the methods as needed. p  pI get two errors and the program doesnt run. The errors are on getSales and saysp  blockquote   pException in thread main java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation   problem          Syntax error, insert  to complete Blockp  precode  at getSales.getSalesgetSales.java57   at getSales.maingetSales.java36 codepre blockquote  pHere is what I havep  precodeimport java.util.Scanner public class getSales          private static String monthArray[]                                January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August,                     September, October, November, December                   private static double monthlySales[]  new double[12]     private static int currentMonth  0      public static void mainString[] args                             double getSales, totalSales, averageSales, highestMonth, lowestMonth, highestSales, lowestSales                      for  currentMonth  0 currentMonth lt monthlySales.length currentMonth monthlySales[currentMonth]                   getSales          int highestMonthIndex  computeHighestMonthmonthlySales         int lowestMonthIndex  computeLowestMonth monthlySales          displaySaleInfocomputeTotalSalesmonthlySales, computeAverageSales monthlySales,                 highestMonthIndex, monthlySales[highestMonthIndex], lowestMonthIndex, monthlySales[lowestMonthIndex]       End of Main      private static int getSales              Scanner input  new ScannerSystem.in         int size  monthArray.length          for int i  0 i lt size i         System.out.printPlease Enter Sales for   monthArray[i]           monthlySales[i]  input.nextInt         get sales method to store values into monthlysales           gets monthly sales and returns total sales for the year     public static double computeTotalSalesdouble monthlySales[]               double sum  0         for int i  0 i lt monthlySales.length i                       sum  monthlySales[i]                   return sum           gets monthly sales and returns average sales     public static double computeAverageSales double monthlySales[]               return computeTotalSales monthlySales  monthlySales.length           determine month with the highest sales     public static int computeHighestMonth double monthlySales[]               int index  0         double val  monthlySales[0]         for int i  0 i lt monthlySales.length i                       if monthlySales[i] gt val                               val  monthlySales[i]                 index  i                               return index                  determine month with the lowest sales     public static int computeLowestMonth double monthlySales[]               int index  0         double val  monthlySales[0]         for int i  0 i lt monthlySales.length i                       if monthlySales[i] lt val                               val  monthlySales[i]                 index  i                               return index            displays all the sales data rounded to two decimal places     public static void displaySaleInfo double totalSales, double averageSales,             int highestMonth, double highestSales, int lowestMonth, double lowestSales                System.out.printfTotalSales .2f , totalSales         System.out.printfAverageSales .2f , averageSales         System.out.printlnHighestMonth   monthArray[highestMonth]         System.out.printfHighestSales .2f , highestSales         System.out.printlnLowestMonth   monthArray[lowestMonth]         System.out.printfLowestSales .2f , lowestSales          codepre

Positive 9993 pI go to run an acceptance test, but it only outputs  code Codeception PHP Testing Framework v2.0.12 Powered by PHPUnit 4.5.1 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors. code Then it quits with out any error message. No tests run, no error message. Browser tests were working fine, and only acceptance tests were broken.p  pI have all ready solved the problem, but I want to create a record for next time I or any one else runs into this problem.p  pIf you codeception is quitting without any errors or fail messages, it means that there is an error in your code somewhere. I found the error in me Acceptance Helper file, where I had a duplicate of a function. Functions can not have the same name in php, so everything fails. But codeception does not output any error messages.p  pIn order to solve this problem, you need to look through your Helper functions to find a syntax error, or it could be in your actual tests.  The reason it fails is codeception hits an error in the php code, and dies, not throwing any errors. Leaving you confused and frustrated. Now you can find this question and get back to doing what youre doing.p  pYAY p

Negative 9993 pSo I have been working on a small web application site for a group of friends of mine and have come to the realization that things need to change.  The application has two faces to it p  ol lia public facing side that serves dynamic data to visitors and non admins, and li lian admin side where admins can update or create the dynamic data to be served.li ol  pThis application started off as a single webforms project sectioned off by separate pages and and web.config security of folders.  Then it grew into separate projects MVC admin side and webforms front end.  I later had to bring it to where it is today, a single web app with a mix of MVC admin and webforms public, due to deployment issues.p  pNow I am looking at migrating it to a single MVC project.  I would like to keep my administration functions desperate from my public facing side by URL  like Admin and am not sure how to do it.  I have read a lot of topics on grouping controllers into modules but am not sure that is the right thing yet.  p  ul liShould I just create admin functions inline with the rest of the public app and determine if the user is logged in or not  li liOr should I create Admin controllers that are separate from the public controllers EventAdminController vs CalendarControllerli liWhat have others done  li ul  pSuggestions welcome, thanks stackoverflow.p  hr  pYes I am using the ASP.Net MVC framework from Microsoft.  Darryl, are you saying to place my views in an Admin folder and protect that it using a web.config to check security and roles or to place my controllers in an Admin folderp  pMy assumptions was that you were saying to place the controllers in an Admin folder, say under controllers.  This would still mean that HomeController in Controllers is different than HomeAdminController in ControllersAdmin.  In this case you could configure specific routes for each but I dont see how simply putting a controller in a different folder would protect them unless using the Authorize attribute on actions.p  pAs for placing the views in a different folder, I can see how that could work in theory.  But wouldnt the controller in theory without any authorize attributes still execute up to the point that the view is returned  I would then either expect a redirect or an error.  Either way I wouldnt want to execute my controller action if you cant get to the view, and would rather not do any internal action prechecking.p

So I want the new column to be not null with a default of zero.p  pFrom experience adding this column will take some time, presumably because the database will need to rewrite all the rows with a new column with a filled value.

Negative 9993 pIm writing a plugin for a program where I have a custom user control with a strongTreeViewstrong. When the user selects or deselects objects in the native program strongObjectSelectedstrong and strongObjectDeselectedstrong events are evoked. When these events are fired my program will select or deselect corresponding nodes in the tree view.p  pThe problem is this is a graphic 3d modeling program. So its really easy for the user to draw a selection box across a thousand little objects and pummel my code with a thousand strongObjectSelectedstrong events. So right now my plugin works but if the user selects too many objects they have to sit there an wait for my plugin to deal with all the strongObjectSelectedstrong events.p  pInstead of doing something at each selection event I could instead cache the selected objects into a separate collection and then process the list in bulk rather then each object one at a time. But how can I tell when the last strongObjectSelectedstrong event is evokedp  pI think I need to utilize multiple threads so that each object selected event resets a timer. When the timer finally gets a chance to reach its end time it processes the full list of selected objects. p  pAlthough Ive never done anything with multiple threads so I have no idea where to start on something like that. Plus I dont really like the idea of having my plugin rely on some predefined time limit. What if the a user is on a fasterslower computer Or what if one of the objects they are selecting is really complex and takes longer to select for some reason then other objectsp

I have solved the slower connection issue by allowing the mobile connection to send data in a five second interval, the wlan connection have an interval of one second.p  pBut is there a better way of doing the slowdown Perhaps by sending smaller packets, meaning I need to send more datap  pAny ideas on a good way to slow down one of the connectionsp  pOrjanpp  pA simple client example with only one connection.p  precodedef client import sys, time, socket  port  11111 host  127.0.0.1 bufsize  1024  try mySocket  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKSTREAM mySocket.connecthost, port except socket.error, value, message if mySocket mySocket.close print Could not open socket   message sys.exit1 mySocket.sendHello, server data  mySocket.recvbufsize print data time.sleep5  mySocket.close  client codepre  pA simple server listening to one port.p  precodedef server import sys, os, socket  port  11111 host   backlog  5 bufsize  1024  try listeningsocket  socket.socketsocket.AFINET,socket.SOCKSTREAM listeningsocket.setsockoptsocket.SOLSOCKET,socket.SOREUSEADDR,1  listeningsocket.bindhost, port  listeningsocket.listenbacklog except socket.error, value, message if listeningsocket listeningsocket.close print Could not open socket   message sys.exit1  while True acceptedsocket, adress  listeningsocket.accept data  acceptedsocket.recvbufsize if data acceptedsocket.sendHello, and goodbye. acceptedsocket.close  server codepre

Negative 9993 pI have something like thisp  precodeuses MSXML2TLB type TDocumentType  dtOrder, dtInvoice, dtStatus, dtError  And a few more, actually function DetermineDocumentTypedoc IXMLDOMDocument2 TDocumentType ... codepre  pIt must do something simple determine what kind of XML is contained in the doc parameter. The XML could be something like codeltOrdergt...ltOrdergtcode, codeltInvoicegt...ltInvoicegtcode, codeltStatusgt...ltStatusgtcode, codeltErrorgt...ltErrorgtcode or something else. The internal structure of these files is very similar so the only reliable way to determine its type by getting the first tag name from the XML. Doc.nodeName and Doc.baseName dont work. I could just read the XML as text, parsse it by code to determine the tagname but its a dirty trick that I refuse to use. So I need a method which will return the tag name through proper methods of the IXMLDOMDocument2 interface. To make it worse, I have no control over the code outside this function and as a second limit, this root tag happens to be case insensitive, making a trick like using selectNode unworkable. This happens to be a problem because of legacy code and bad decisions that have been made in the past by the previous developers. Fortunately, only the root tag seems to be this weird in this project. Btw, this function is to replace a similar function that would do well on the TheDailyWTF site. It previously would read the XML from the interface, convert it completely to uppercase and finally do a lot of pos function calls to check for any of the possible tags. Not very efficient, especially since this code has to process a few thousands of XML files...p  pstrongSo, how to get the tag name of the root element in an object of type IXMLDOMDocument2strongp

Negative 9993 pI am attempting to make some reports in Excel using a pivot table of a Sql server view. One of the customer requirements is to be able to filter the reports based on a date range they select, which seems reasonable. The end user process needs to be fairly simple, so my preference is to have a cell for begin date and one for end date and allow the user to  enter these and refresh the table.p  pThere are two problems which I havent been able to get pastp  ol lipSelecting a date filter doesnt appear to provide any way for me to reference a cell as a source for the value. I have to put it in at the time. pli lipIt seems as if it is only possible to define a date range if I am grouping on the date field. For some of the reports, this violates the specification. The Report Filter section of a pivot table only seems to allow me to filter by individual values rather than a range. This gets unmanageable on real data which might have hundreds of dates to go through.pli ol  pOne thing I have tried is to create an intermediate table without any aggregates columns in a separate sheet in the same workbook, and then filter that. This hid the columns correctly in that intermediate table, but had no effect on the pivot table which derived from it.p  pDoes anyone have ideas for how I can make this work It seems like a fairly obvious use case  is there something I am missing about how pivot tables are supposed to be usedp

Negative 9993 pIve read a few posts on this, but theres still one thing thats not clear for me. I know this might be rather a n00b question, but Ive actually got rather far into development without quite grasping this fundamental issue. A symptom of being self taught I guess.  p  pYou declare a variable in your header, like sop  precodeinterface SomeClass  NSObject      NSMutableArray anArray   property nonatomic, retain NSMutableArray anArray  end codepre  pAnd then in your main file you synthesise it and set it to an initial valuep  precode    implementation SomeClass  synthesize anArray   SomeClass init     if self  [super init]          self.anArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity10]  [return self] codepre  pAnd release it when your Class deallocsp  precode voiddealloc  [anArray release] [super dealloc]  codepre  pNow, when I run instruments, the linep  precodeself.anArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity10] codepre  pis identified as a memory leak. Is it a memory leak because when you define the variable anArray in the header it allocates memory Because I thought it was a null pointer. Therefore when you want to initialise it, and you call [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity10], you are reallocating the memory, and losing the pointer to the original allocationp  pSo instead, I use the convenience class methodp  precodeimplementation SomeClass      synthesize anArray       SomeClass init         if self  [super init]              self.anArray  [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity10]          [return self] codepre  pThis is no longer identified as a memory leak in instruments. And since its a convenience method, anArray is autoreleased. However, if I am to assume that the instance declaration in the header allocates memory, which would explain the previous issue, then should I still release anArray Does setting the initial values in this way retain it perhapsp  pI understand the difference between p  precodeNSMutableArray anArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity10] codepre  pand p  precodeNSMutableArray anArray  [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapactiy10] codepre  pbut what Im not sure I understand is when youve declared NSMutableArray anArray in your header, which of the two approaches you should use and why. And whether or not if you use the second approach, you should still release anArray when you call dealloc. p  pI might add that Ive found the following postslinks usefulp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1740286suggestthebestwayofinitializationofarrayorotherobjectshttpstackoverflow.comquestions1740286suggestthebestwayofinitializationofarrayorotherobjectsa  li lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions193288whatisthecostofusingautoreleaseincocoa193640httpstackoverflow.comquestions193288whatisthecostofusingautoreleaseincocoa193640a  li lia hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualMemoryMgmtMemoryMgmt.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualMemoryMgmtMemoryMgmt.htmla  li lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1053592objectivecclassvsinstancemethodshttpstackoverflow.comquestions1053592objectivecclassvsinstancemethodsali ul

Negative 9993 pIve embedded the LuaInterface project into an application written in C using .NET Framework 4.0. After compiling LuaInterface and Lua 5.1 Ive referenced them in my application and created a Lua VM and exposed a few .NET classes. When the Lua VM doesnt make many calls, performance is not affected at all but when it starts to call a larger number of .NET functions the entire application becomes slow and unresponsive.p  pIn response to this, Ive made an additional thread to run the Lua VM on. For some reason though, the thread on which the GUI is updated will not update while Lua is doing a function call, resulting in stuttering in the GUI.

Negative 9993 pstrongQuestionstrongp  pGiven a Classpath Container Ive written as a pluginextension, how do I add it to the classpath, automaticallyp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pOk so Im an experienced Java Developer but extremely new to writing Eclipse Plugins.  Ive been googling, following tutorials and reading source code of other plugins for a couple days.  I know exactly what I want to do but not exactly how to do it. p  pRight now, in Eclipse, when I click a resource and choose Run as JUnit test as in br br hr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNLJHS.png altfor some reason, my pics dont work anymore. Ill fix this soon... br brp  hr  pBehind the scenes, the m2eclipse plugin somehow generates a run configuration that contains the Maven Dependencies classpath container, like the following br brp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWYYgA.gif altalt textp  pMy best guess is that the Maven Dependencies classpath container is added through some extension point being used by the M2Eclipse plugin.  Similarly, I want to add my classpath container, automatically, whenever a user runs a JUnit testso it shows up under User Entries.  What extension points can I use to make something like that happen  Ive been looking at emorg.eclipse.jdt.core.classpathContainerInitializerem but Im not sure thats going to do what I need. hr strongIdeal Resultstrongp  pIdeally, Id like to write a plugin that takes every entry in the projects build path and adds it to the classpath of a run configuration whenever a new launch configuration is created via emRun As  JUnit testem.  This should be the default behavior of Eclipse but its notp  pMy nextbest solution would be to simply add my custom classpath container to the run configurations build path, automatically.  At the end of the day, I just want one classpath for any java code our team runslaunches.  This shouldnt be so hardp  pAny advise on how to achieve any of this would be appreciated  Even basic pointers on where to look to understand how particular Extension Points are intended to be used the basic JavaDocs APIs are terrible.

Negative 9993 pI have a WCF web service built in .NET 4.0 that is configured to require a usernamepassword on each call and uses a Server certificate in the behaviour to encrypt the request.

Negative 9993 pI have received requests for my iPhone app, to be able to sync it between a persons iPhone and iPad, or between two iPhones in the same family, etc. I have been searching online now for some time, and this still is not clear to me. I am a pretty new developer, and I know enough to have gotten an app released, but I am not a professional programmer. p  pI know that DropBox and SugarSync use the cloud, but I have not used them as yet and I am not sure how I would implement them for my Core Data database. I also watched a video for Marcus Zarras ZSync, which looks awesome, but I do not have a desktop application yet, and Im not sure that that is the solution for me. p  pI downloaded the DropBox api and sample app and am starting to play with it, but I dont want to waste too much time if I am heading down a rabbit trail. I would love if the iOS offered some sort of a sync option but I looked and Im pretty sure it doesnt. p  pThis seems like pretty complicated stuff. I would love if someone could point me in the right direction. Maybe even a tutorial if there is one. Just to keep Core Data database synced between multiple maybe even more than 2 iDevices. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 9993 pIm developing my first Windows Phone 7 app. I dont yet have access to an actual device, so I am relying on the emulator that ships with the SDK.p  pIn my app, I use the codeEmailComposeTaskcode and codeSmsComposeTaskcode where required.

But when I then push the back button to get out of the task and back to my app, the app state is lost  its as if I am launching it fresh all over again.p  pBut, where it gets weird, is that on occasion this doesnt happen.

Negative 9993 pthe problem here its that I need to run one process inside an Instance of a virtual desktop on MACOSX snow leopard. But for example when I make a test on SPACES which is the default desktop manager wich comes with MACOSX I realize that  processes are shared between the desktops, so eventually I could kill any process running inside the other desktops, lets say desktop number 01, from the root desktop. But I would like that my process only could be executed or launched into the virtual desktop that I choose, while the root desktop its unable to see it or interact with it in any way. I know that in Microsoft windows this its perfectly reachable, so i think that in MACOSX it could be too.p  pany idea  its there some guidelines in order to get this   p

Negative 9993 pIm looking for the most efficient way to build a backend for storingprocessing data. Basically, data is sent to a server, parsed then saved to a db. Some processing is then done on it based on other data in the db and then alerts are raised via email or sms.p  pThe platform is .NET and the DB is SQL Server 2005 or maybe 2008.p  pI.e.p  ol liA temperature sensor sends 4 bytes of data to a server.li liServer converts data to a real value say 20.li liThe value is then saved to a SQL server db.li liThe value is then checked against a row in table which has bounds set for that sensor i.e 050li liIf outside the bounds an alert is raised. Sent via SMS or email.li ol  pThis all seems pretty straight forward but Im looking for the best way to do it, given that the ideal scenario is that it all happens in real time and it could be potentially 100s or 1000s of requests per second. I wanted to leverage some of the new features of SQL 200508 such as the Service Broker, CLR integration, triggers etc of which I have little experience.p  pSteps 1 amp 2 have already been completed.p  pWould it be wise to use the Service broker or MSMQ considering the number of Transactions for queuing At what point do I process the alert data given that I need to do a look up on the boundary data I have some ideas how I would like the process the data but am unsure of the best technology  methodology to use. p  pMy idea is starting at step 3 is to submit the data to the Service broker which in turn calls a CLR procedure to process the business logic on the data. Or do I use a trigger to add the data to the Service broker to process the data then Can the Service broker call a CLR procedure directly Is using the service broker even the right idea given that I want to process the data more event driven rather than pollingp  pFrom the examples I have seen on the Service Broker it looks as though you need have code to receive the data, where as all I really want to do is add the data to a queue and have the queue emptied automatically processing the alert data as it does so.p  pI could do all of this via a standard stored procedure but I would like to use stored procedures minimally and instead use CLR integration as the business logic will be a lot more complex than in the example.p  pGiven that Service broker handles queuing and threading I thought it could be a good candidate for calling a CLR procedure to process the alert data and send the sms or emailp  pPlease show me the light Thanksp

Negative 9993 pI have a WCF service layer which uses pure DTOs.p  pOn the server side, I take these DTOs and pass them to my business logic layer, basically a set of Manager classes for each entity or group of entities.p  pThe Manager class methods take in a DTO as a paramater, in the first lines of each method, I take the DTO and using AutoMapper, map it to my Entity Framework POCO. Then I do my LinQ queries or repository methods Im using DBContext from EF 4.1, and if needed, map the result entity back to a DTO and return it back to WCF service method.p  pAlmost every method in my Manager class is doing this mapping and remapping, its a ton of repetative boilerplate code.

Negative 9993 pIm trying to uncompress data that was compressed using the ZLIB library written by Jeanloup Gailly back in the 1990s.  I think it is a popular library I see a lot of programs that ship the zlib32.dll file it uses so I hope someone will be familiar enough with it to help me.  I am using the compress function directly which from what I read uses rfc1951 DEFLATE format.p  pHere is a segment of the code I am using to read some compressed data from a stream and uncompress itp  precodeInputStream is  new ByteArrayInputStreambuf  GZIPInputStream gzis  new GZIPInputStreamis  InflaterInputStream iis  new InflaterInputStreamis  byte[] buf2  new byte[uncompressedDataLength]  iis.readbuf2 codepre  pThe iis.readbuf2 function throws an internal exception of Data Format Error.  I tried using GZIPInputStream also, but that also throws the same exception.p  pThe buf variable is type byte[] and I have confirmed by debugging that it is the same as what my C program gets back from the ZLIB compress function the actual data comes from a server over TCP.  uncompressedDataLength is the known size of the uncompressed data that was also provided by the C program server.p  pHas anyone tried readingwriting data using this library and then readingwriting the same data on the Android using Javap  pI did find a pure Java port of ZLIB referenced in a few places, and if I need to I can try that, but I would rather use the builtinOS functions if possible.p

Negative 9993 pI have a tree view on the left side.

Manual implementation it is then. However, now there seem to be another problem not sure if I should ask this as a separate question.p  pWhen selecting a node the textbox gains focus as intended, but only when using the keyboard. It doesnt work when selecting a node with the mouse. First I thought that it might be a mouse event thats interfering, but stepping revealed that the codeMouseUpcode event fired first and then the codeAfterSelectcode event which sets the focus, so I dont think its interfering. The textboxs codeEntercode event is also fired, but for some reason it loses focus again to the tree.p  pThanxp

Negative 9993 pI am just discovering codeSweavecode and codeRcode. I have seen some examples of codeSweavecode documents and have also started to write one or two on my own. I am impressed by the ability of doing computations in codeRcode and outputting results directly in a codeLaTeXcode document. p  pNow I am thinking of bigger documents as we usually have with codeLaTeXcode that consist of several pages and several parts. With codeLaTeXcode I use WinEdt, I set a main document e.g. codemain.texcode and then have other subsidiary documents like codeintroduction.texcode, codediscussion.texcode etc. p  pMy question is Can we do this with codeSweavecode as well Now I am working with single codeSweavecode document .Rnw alone. Can we have multiple codeSweavecode documents with one main and the secondary ones like we normally do with codeLaTeXcode p  pA workaround would be to have separate codeSweavecode files and then sweave them to produce the codeRcode codeLaTeXcode chunks which can be copied to a codeLaTeXcode document but then the whole idea seems quite inefficient and time consuming. p  pPlease do let know what suggestions and solutions that you have.p  pThanks a lot...p

Negative 9993 pJust started with JQuery for AJAX calls and what I thought would be a simple script has had me baffled two days now. Basically I want the form data POSTed to the server, and if data entered by user okay then a Thank You message is returned, or a message is returned to say there are errors.p  pIn both events, its HTML that I want returned. This is happening however, when there are errors in the form data, and the form is submitted again, there is a page refresh I know this as hitting F5 produces the browsers default dialogue box asking to SEND or CANCEL.p  pThis page refresh only happens once submitted the form the HTML returned from server on initial AJAX call a second time.

So I am thinking of doing this in Multi Threaded step itself rather than thinking about partition based approach.p  pPlease help......p  pI referred pro spring batch book and created a staging step listener which is accepting a run id from the job configuration xml using job parameters as belowp  precodeltbeansbean idstagingStepListener classcom.apress.springbatch.statement.listener.StagingStepListener scopestepgt ltbeansproperty namedataSource refdataSourcegt ltbeansproperty nametableName valuetransactiongt ltbeansproperty namewhereClause valuewhere jobId is null and processed is nullgt ltbeansproperty namejobId valuejobParameters[run.id]gt ltbeansbeangt codepre  pWhat i dont find is this From where is this run.id coming from.

Negative 9993 pIn MQ, if you have an instance of an existing queue manager, say queuemanager1 that your app has access to. You can send your message by creating a queue that points to a queue of another queue manager, queuemanager2, through queuemanager1.

Negative 9993 pThere are situations where it can be useful to get the exact pixel width of an codeemcode measurement.  For example, suppose you have an element with a CSS property like border or padding which is measured in ems, and you need to get the exact pixel width of the border or padding.  Theres an existing question which touches on this topicp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1442542howcanigetdefaultfontsizeinpixelsbyusingjavascriptorjqueryHow can i get default font size in pixels by using JavaScript or JQueryap  pThis question is asking about getting the emdefault font sizeem  which is necessary in order to convert a relative codeemcode value to an exact codepxcode value.  p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4530334168288This answera has a pretty good explanation of how to go about getting the default font size of an elementp  blockquote   pSince ems measure width you can always compute the exact pixel font   size by creating a div that is 1000 ems long and dividing its   clientWidth property by 1000. I seem to recall ems are truncated to   the nearest thousandth, so you need 1000 ems to avoid an erroneous   truncation of the pixel result.p blockquote  pSo, using this answer as a guide, I wrote the following function to get the default font sizep  precodefunction getDefaultFontSizeparentElement      parentElement  parentElement  document.body     var div  document.createElementdiv     div.style.width  1000em     parentElement.appendChilddiv     var pixels  div.offsetWidth  1000     parentElement.removeChilddiv     return pixels  codepre  pOnce you have the default font size, you can convert any codeemcode width to codepxcode width by just multiplying the ems by the elements default font size and rounding the resultp  pcodeMath.roundems  getDefaultFontSizeelement.parentNodecodep  pstrongProblemstrong The codegetDefaultFontSizecode is ideally supposed to be a simple, sideeffect free function that returns the default font size.  But it emDOESem have an unfortunate side effect it modifies the DOM  It appends a child and then removes the child. Appending the child is necessary in order to get a valid codeoffsetWidthcode property.  If you dont append the child codedivcode to the DOM, the codeoffsetWidthcode property remains at 0 because the element is never rendered.  Even though we immediately remove the child element, this function can still create unintended side effects, such as firing an event like Internet Explorers codeonpropertychangecode or W3Cs codeDOMSubtreeModifiedcode event that was listening on the parent element. p  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there any way to write a truly sideeffect free codegetDefaultFontSizecode function that wont accidentally fire event handlers or cause other unintended side effectsp

But I dont really get what its supposed to be checkingdoing, since the user IDs are all pulled from the same place anyway. I can sortof get the callback to work, but it seems messyhackish and it hits the database with every single resource that the browser requests. I really dont want to check my database in order to download favicon.ico with every page refresh, but flasklogin seems like its forcing this. p  pIf I dont check the database again, then I have no way to return a User object from this function. The User objectclass gets created in the flask route for logging in, and is thus  out of scope of the callback.p  pWhat I cant figure out is how to pass a User object into this callback function, without having to hit the database every single time. Or, otherwise figure out how to go about doing this in a more effective way. I must be missing something fundamental, but Ive been staring at it for a few days now, throwing all kinds of functions and methods at it, and nothing is working out. p  pHere are relevant snippets from my test code. The User classp  precodeclass UserClassUserMixin      def initself, name, id, activeTrue           self.name  name           self.id  id           self.active  active  def isactiveself      return self.active codepre  pThe function I made to return the user object to FlaskLogins userloader callback functionp  precodedef checkdbuserid        query database again, just so we can pass an object to the callback      dbcheck  userscollection.findone userid  userid       UserObject  UserClassdbcheck[username], userid, activeTrue      if userObject.id  userid           return UserObject      else           return None codepre  pThe callback, which I dont totally understand must return the User object, which gets created after pulling from databasep  precodeloginmanager.userloader def loaduserid      return checkdbid codepre  pThe login routep  precodeapp.routelogin, methods[GET, POST] def login      if request.method  POST and username in request.form           username  request.form[username]             check MongoDB for the existence of the entered username           dbresult  userscollection.findone username  username             resultid  intdbresult[userid]             create User objectinstance           User  UserClassdbresult[username], resultid, activeTrue             if username entered matches database, log user in           if username  dbresult[username]                 log user in,                 loginuserUser                return urlforindex           else                flashInvalid username.       else            flashuInvalid login.       return rendertemplatelogin.html codepre  pMy code kinda works, I can log in and out, but as I said, it must hit the database for absolutely everything, because I have to provide a User object to the callback function in a different namespacescope from where the rest of the login action takes place. Im pretty sure Im doing it all wrong, but I cant figure out how.p  pThe example code provided by flasklogin a hrefhttpsgithub.commaxcountrymanflaskloginblobmasterexampleloginexample.pydoes it this waya, but this only works because its pulling the User objects from a global hardcoded dictionary, not as in a realworld scenario like a database, where the DB must be checked and User objects created emafterem the user enters their login credentials. And I cant seem to find any other example code that illustrates using a database with flasklogin.p  pWhat am missing herep

The problem with the enumerable is after it generates, I have to either have to switch the latter to an Array, or do mumbojumbo for the XmlSerialisation attrs.  Generates a 2mb .cs file, so alot of code that would be autogenerated and would have to have a crapton of .extend.cs files to get it to fit.  Maybe I have to change some switches for it to work  What switches fix thisp  pLinqToXsd  OpenLinqToXsd  Generates the file, hard codes it to reference a DLL file, then forces you to use List no option to go to ObservableCollection, which doesnt have EditItem and cant be used for binding to WPFXAML.  Otherwise, a bunch more .extend.cs files.p  pAltova C generator  Expensive, requires a bunch of their DLLs to include in the project, messy.p  hr  pLong story short, has anyone used any of these systems successfully and what did you have to do to shoehorn them  What kind of pain will I have to deal with beyond the issues Im havingp  hr  pI remember now for XSD.exe XSD notation doesnt export, individual classes such as note dont serialise out to xml.  I would have to write out the entire thing from scorepartwise to every piece inbetween.  Which means I cant serialise a graph object that has notes as vertices.p

Negative 9993 pIm seeing a weird bug in Chrome but not Firefox with a web app with an instant messagingstyle view. The input box is absolutely positioned at the bottom of the page and has height codeXcode while the scrolling pane of messages is absolutely positioned with codebottom Xcode such that the bottom of the pane lines up with the input box.p  pInside the message pane there are many messages. Each of these have an absolutely positioned child. When the contents of one of these inner children changes say, with jQuerys code.htmlcode the bottom margin of the bottom message becomes ignored.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netZPqUQ3 relnofollowHeres a minimal jsfiddle examplea. It scrolls the message pane to the bottom for you. Click the button, and youll see that the margin on the bottom message box is no longer respected when determining how to size the message pane codeacode.p  pMy workaround is to remove the absolutely positioned children. In the jsfiddle, you can change the codeposition absolutecode to codefloat leftcode on codeinnercode and see that the bug no longer manifests. Im curious why this problem is happening, though.p

Negative 9993 pIve been playing around with the NIO and nonblocking sockets expecting to code a simple and high performant server where I could easily throttle the input data if and when the writing or the middle processing takes more time than it should. Unfortunately it seems Im failing to understand some concepts of the select process.p  pAlbeit Ive seen some strange behaviors and have gone in cycles doing and redoing my code, there is one use case that fails all the time and thats the one Im describing here  the case where I try to write more bytes than I read.p  pIve been trying to follow the patters from other examples, where the socket is either at READ or WRITE but never both, and never none, and as soon as there are bytes to write, the socket switches to WRITE, writes as much as possible, and then switches back to READ.p  pFrom my debugging sessions what it looked like is that if I just write without any read, it gets into a point that the select never comes back or comes only after several seconds unless I force a read in between. Unfortunately at that point I do not want to read, as I have already too much data to process, so I tried to enable the read flag and read only one byte, but with too much traffic even that is not enough. The point where it hangs has no value related to the buffer sizes or the OS buffer sizes as far as I could see.p  pThe sample contains 4 tests, test 1 returns the same amount of bytes and works, test 4 returns half of it, and obviously works, test 2 and 3 returns twice the input and fails miserably.p  pIn this sample I dont even try to throttle the input but log if the buffer or the queue fills up, so please help me and tell me what am I doing wrong.p  pTo test it just dump any data into it like thisp  precodecat devzero  pv bracN1  nc 1 8080  pv bracN2 gt devnull      1  338MB [  58MBs]

Negative 9993 pI am having a crash problem when using a TableView with Core Data and any help is greatly appreciated. The scenario isp  ul lipI have a UITableViewController showing data stored in Core Data. I use a NSFetchResultsController to do the fetching as instructed by the documentation. I have a dedicated NSManagedObjectContext exclusive for the main thread to fetch the data. pli lipThe data is actually coming from a server. When my application launches, I have a background thread to refresh the data into my Core Data stack. As recommended by Apple, I use a different NSManagedObjectContext in the background thread to refresh the data. During the refresh, old data will be deleted.pli lipAfter the background saves the changes, I used the NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification to trigger a call to do the mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification on the main threads context.pli lipcontrollerDidChangeContent of the FRC is also implemented which call the UITableViewController to reload.pli ul  pEverything works fine  except if I scroll the TableView while the data refresh is in progress, the app will crash with the Core Data could not fulfill a fault... error. After tracing through the code, I embelieveem the cause is there is a small time lag between the background thread saving the delete of the data and the main thread context merge operation. During this time lag, some of the managed objects in the main threads context is deleted and so when the table is scrolled and the data source method access the deleted object, the app will crash.p  pIs my belief correct If so, how should I deal with this time lagp  pMany Thanks.p

Negative 9993 pI have a setup with QTreeView displaying a QSortFilteredProxyModel with custom filtering in filterAcceptsRow accepting only rows depending on the value of a parent row value selected in a QComboBox via QStyledItemDelegatederived class. For example, if I choose in a row Type the value BMW, I wanna display children for this special case. This works great for the first item, I can choose these values inside of Item1 multiple levels down up to 5 levels. Everything works great.p  pHowever, ive notice that once i am playing with item1 and this custom filtering and then adding an item2, the problems start. First thing I notice is, that QTreeView does unexpand the common parent of item1item2 and displays only the children of the root item. The normal behaviour and behaviour of adding item1 does like that is expand the parent of item1. Why this gets confused on the second item and ONLY IF ive been playing with the item1 childrensettings, idk. Also, Ive noticed that in item2 the filtering does not work correctly. I have a QComboBox in item2Type that have children depending on item2Type value.. the first child for default value of the QComboBox still gets displayed like it should, but when changing QComboBox the view does not get updated any longer and stays with this first loaded child inside item2item3... However, the DelegatesetModelData gets called with the correct valueindex and calls TreeItemsetData accordingly. Its just that the filtering seems to be stuck with the old value of TreeItemdata. Please note again, that this does only occur after ive been playing with item1.. If i leave that item untouched, I can correctly play with all other items item2, item3, ... and its doing fine.p  pI would be very happy if anybody can help. p  pDoes anybody have tipps for me, what might cause the reset of expandedStates, even though the expand gets called the same for item1 and item2 insertion and works great for item1   What might cause my further problemsp  pExampleDelegate.hp  preclass ExampleDelegate      public QStyledItemDelegate      QOBJECT     public         ExampleDelegateQObject parent  0         ExampleDelegatevoid         QWidget createEditorQWidget parent, const QStyleOptionViewItem option, const QModelIndex index const         void setModelDataQWidget editor, QAbstractItemModel model, const QModelIndex index const         void setEditorDataQWidget editor, const QModelIndex index const pre  pProxyModel.hp  pre class ProxyModel      public QSortFilterProxyModel      QOBJECT         public         ProxyModelQObject parent         ProxyModelvoid         void refresh         void doReset          pthreadmutext proxyMutex           int rowCountQModelIndex parent const         bool hasChildren  const QModelIndex  parent  QModelIndex  const         QModelIndex parentconst QModelIndex index const         QModelIndex indexint row, int col, QModelIndex parent const             bool filterAcceptsRowint sourceRow, const QModelIndex sourceParent const   pre  pProxyModel.cppp  pre bool ProxyModelfilterAcceptsRowint sourceRow, const QModelIndex sourceParent const      printfProxyModelfilterAcceptRow n     pthreadmutexlockthisproxyMutex      QAbstractItemModel source  thissourceModel     QModelIndex index  sourceindexsourceRow, 0, sourceParent     TreeItem item  TreeItem index.internalPointer     ifitem  NULL          int showOnly  itemshowOnlyParentDetailDialog         ifshowOnly  1              TreeItem parent   TreeItem index.internalPointerparent              ifparent  NULL                   int parentOption  parentselectedIndex                 printfparentOption  u  n, parentOption                 bool result  showOnly  parentselectOptionsatparentOption.detailDialog                  pthreadmutexunlockthisproxyMutex                 return result              else                  pthreadmutexunlockthisproxyMutex                 return true                                   pthreadmutexunlockthisproxyMutex     return true   pre

When an instance of Word is already open and a new or existing document is opened then these events fire fine.p  pThe suggestion Ive seen is to handle the DocumentChange event which is always fired when Word loads instead of the other two events.p  pMy question is how would I go about this strongThe DocumentChange event does not have any parameters so how would I know when the document new or existing was just openedstrong p  pAdditionally, I already have logic in the DocumentChange event and the processing for new and existing documents is different so I cant just throw all of my code into the event.p  precodeprivate void ThisAddInStartupobject sender, System.EventArgs a    this.Application.DocumentChange  new ApplicationEvents4DocumentChangeEventHandlerApplicationDocumentChange   private void ApplicationDocumentChange     How do I handle NewDocument or DocumentOpen  codepre

Negative 9993 pHi I have a joomla site that is working perfectly in all browsers except IE. p  pa hrefhttpwww.creativeinfusion.com.au relnofollowwww.creativeinfusion.com.auap  pWhen I view it in IE a lot of the CSS doesnt seem to be recognised. When I use the developer tool to view the html and css, there is a lot of different code compared to other browsers. For example there are a heap of extra codedivcode IDs called codeslickuniquecode. These are not visible in other browsers. I am wondering if there is a plugin that is creating these ID for IE. I havnt been able to find it thoughp  pEven the HTML structure looks different. There are codedivscode called coderthiddencode in IE but not in other browsers. I have a IE only style sheet and I have been trying to override or fix the positioning but nothing I do changes the site.p  pThere is also this code attached to the divs in IEp  precodefunctionb,gvar hElement.Constructors[b]ifhreturn hgiftypeof bstringreturn document.idb.setgifggif[w].testbvar eSlick.parseb.expressions[0][0]  be.tagdive.tagife.idampampg.idnullg.ide.idvar de.attributesifdforvar a,f0,cd.lengthfltcfad[f]ifg[a.key]nullcontinue  ifa.valuenullampampa.operatorg[a.key]a.valueelseifa.valueampampa.operatorg[a.key]trueife.classListampampg[class]nullg[class]e.classList.join   return document.newElementb,g codepre  pAny ideasp  pI have narrowed it down to this bit of code in the strongindex.phpstrong of the templatep  precodeltphp          browser  gantrygtbrowser          gantrygtdisplayHead         gantrygtaddStylesarraytemplate.css,joomla.css,overlays.css          if gantrygtgetfixedheader ampamp gantrygtgetmenutype  splicemenu gantrygtaddScriptrtfixedheader.js          if browsergtplatform  iphone             gantrygtaddInlineScriptwindow.addEventdomready, function new SmoothScroll         if gantrygtgetloadtransition ampamp isBrowserCapable           gantrygtaddScriptloadtransition.js           hidden   classrthidden        else            hidden              gt codepre  pIf I delete that code and refresh the page, the page loads, no css obviously. Then if I put the above code back in and refresh the page, the page works fine, even when I refresh this page. But if i try to visit another page, it goes back to having all of the extra divs, and that function code above, even after dumping the cache and refreshing.

Negative 9993 pthis is not a technical question, but one for advice regarding the best practices in designing an Android tablet UI.p  pIve got my concept of an Android Phone app pinned down.p  pThe first activity master view launched contains a tab bar with three fragments from which the user can launch detail view activities of different sorts.p  pBoth the masterview activity and the detailview activities have actions in their action bars. Different detail views have different action items.p  pMy question is How should I organize and display the action items on a tablet, where an activity combines both views side by sidep  pThe problem is the unified action bar for both the masterview fragment and whatever kind of detail fragment is shown. I do not think it is a good idea to start messing with the contents of the action bar whenever a different kind of detail view is opened.p  pThe Android Design Guide does not tell you much on that front. There is a sample of a Contacts app in the Multipane Layouts section, but it does not actually deal with the problem. It evades it, by putting the single relevant action as an icon inside the detail view fragment.p  pAny advice with regards to best practices and references are appreciated.p
Negative 9993 pMotivation I would like to construct an enum that represents all possible values for some family of values I hesitate to say class here. The enum will have additional methods, fields, and perhaps even implement other interfaces. I would then like to pass this enum to another method, where it will iterate over all of the possible values using codeEnum.valuescode and do some work.p  pIve researched and found that enum codeFoocode actually becomes codeFoo extends EnumltFoogtcode. This is why I cannot extend an enum. I have tried to define my method arguments asp  precodemyMethodClassltgt bar ... myMethodClasslt extends Enumgt bar ... myMethodClasslt extends Enumltgtgt bar ... codepre  pbut inside the method when I try something basic likep  precodeint i  bar.values.length codepre  pit fails. Is there some other way I can do this or avoid the need to do thisp  pNote I could pass an actual instance of the enum and use codebar.getDeclaringClasscode to find the enum class rather than an instance but this is pretty ugly.p

Negative 9993 pI am developing a product which uses an Oracle database 11g. The product will most likely have to be customised for each client  this may involve changing PLSQL functions slightly or modifying a view for instance. My question is is there any way of automatically keeping a record of structural changes like this, and perhaps saving it to a table for future reference Or will it have to be a more manual process e.g just remembering to insert a row into a log table describing any changes that have been madep  pThanksp

Negative 9993 pIm starting a Java background process Solr from a batch file withp  precodestart b java jar ... codepre  pThe problem is that codestart bcode will shield the process from SIGINT signals, see codehelp startcode. This means that codetaskkill pid ...code wont work and codetaskkill f pid ...code will kill the process without letting it execute shutdown hooks first.p  pIs there another way to start the background process on Windows from a .bat file without opening a window and without shielding it from SIGINT Or is there another way of sending a signal to the java VM so that Solr shuts down gracefully when running from codestart bcodep  pId like to use a normal batch script rather than VBScript or similar if possible as this is what most our users probably know best.p

To make this work, I am thinking of flagging the objects with an enum type, and having a registry arrayish of these strategies. Ideally, the correct strategy would be accessed with some simple operation like a bitwise operator between the two types.p  pThis pseudocode may make what Im trying to explain easier to understandp  precodeenum Type  A, B, C   struct Object    Type type   class ActionRunner    vectorltStrategygt strategies    void registerStrategytype1, type2, strategy      strategies[type1 operator type2]  strategy       void runStrategyFortype1, type2      strategies[type1 operator type2].execute     codepre  pThis would be easy to solve using a map, but Id like to use an array or vector because a map seems like an overkill for a problem like this and using an array is probably much faster.p  pSo the problem is I dont know what operator I might be able to use to select the position of the right strategy. Ive been thinking of a few combinations but it seems all of them end up causing collisions with the different combinations at some point.p  pDoes anyone have any cluesadvice on what I may be able to use for thisp  pPS I know premature optimization is bad, but Im just trying to figure out if this problem can be solved in a simple way.p  p EDIT p  pIn light of the answers, Ive been giving the problem some extra thought and Ive come to the conclusion what I intended with this question isnt possible the way Id like it. Im going to try to restate the problem Im trying to solve now using this question.p  pId like to have a class structure in which theres objects of certain type BaseClass and a processor object that takes two objects derived from BaseClass and runs the right strategy for those. Something like thisp  precodeclass Processor    void run DerivedA a, DerivedB b   class BaseClass  class DerivedA public BaseClass  class DerivedB public BaseClass   BaseClass a  new DerivedA BaseClass b  new DerivedB  processor.runa, b codepre  pAccording to what I understand, this would not work as Id expect if what is passed as parameters to run are references, which is what Id rather do. Is there any way to do this without waytoocomplicated code tripple dispatchp  pI have in mind something like the double dispatch combined with an slave processor object  that I think would work, but that seems awfully complex and probably a pain to maintain and extend. p  pThanksp

Negative 9993 pI ran into some shady piece of code in which a codeHashSetcode is accessed and modified by several threads at the same time, and I wanted to know what effects this could have had, considering the Javadoc only explains the behavior is nondeterministic under concurrent, unsynchronized accesses.  p  pSpecifically, is it possible that a call to coderemoveelementcode returns codetruecode, but that the effects of the call are never ever seen by other threads ie. codecontainselementcode will always return codetruecode in other threads  p  pPS Just to reassure you, I know this code is bad and I will replace the codeHashSetcode with an equivalent synchronized collection.p
Negative 9993 pIm developing an asp.net MVC web application and the client has request that we try our best to make it as resilient as possible to Denial of Service attacks. They are worried that the site may receive malicious high volume requests with the intention to slowtake down the site.p  pI have discussed this with the product owner as really being out of the remit for the actual web application. I believe it falls to the responsibility of the hostingnetwork team to monitor traffic and respond to malicious requests.p  pHowever they are adamant that the application should have some precautions built into it. They do not want to implement CAPTCHA though.p  pIt has been suggested that we restrict the number of requests that can be made for a session within a given time frame. I was thinking of doing something like this  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions33969bestwaytoimplementrequestthrottlinginaspnetmvcBest way to implement request throttling in ASP.NET MVCa But using the session id not the client IP as this would cause problems for users coming from behind a corporate firewall  their IP would all be the same.p  pThey have also suggested adding the ability to turn off certain areas of the site  suggesting that an admin user could turn off database intensive areas..... However this would be controlled through the UI and surely if it was under DOS attack an admin user would not be able to get to it anyway.p  pMy question is, is it really worth doing this Surely a real DOS attack would be much more advancedp  pDo you have any other suggestionsp

Negative 9993 pI am testing Piwik if it would be suitable for analytics and tracking for my Ruby on Rails application. For testing purposes, I am running piwik on localhost, tracking the rails application running also on localhost. Piwik tracking is integrated by the piwikanalytics gem, and to track goal conversions I am using the piwiktracker gem. All my goals are manually converted by calling the goal conversion method from a controller.p  pMy problem is that I wish to record goal conversions by a custom variable scope visit, but this does not seem to work. The custom variable is set correctly, and the goals conversions are recorded correctly, but the goal conversions are not sortable by the value of the custom variable. p  pIn my application, there are three different types of users, and I wish to track their actions by user type. To this end, I have defined a custom variable which contains the user type. I have included setting this variable in the piwiktrackingtag in application.haml.html, because I cannot know the entry page beforehand. I see that the variable is set correctly, because visits are recorded by this variable. The goals, too, are converted correctly.p  pHowever, in the goals panel, when I click on the By custom variable option, I see 0 conversions for each different user type. p  pI am wondering if this is a Piwik issue, and not caused by me. I have also tried resetting the custom variable when calling the goal tracking methodp  precodepiwik.request.customvariable1,Role,userrole.trackgoal1 codepre  pbut this makes no difference.p

Negative 9993 pThis is more of a metaquestion than I need actual help with but I could not find information about it elsewhere.

So my query looked like the followingp  precodeALTER TABLE Database.mytable DROP FOREIGN KEY abcibfk1 ALTER TABLE Database.mytable DROP COLUMN abc codepre  pI get another error message that says Error Code 1025. Error on rename of .Databasesql461somerandomnumbers to .Databasemytable errno 150br br I figure I would use the builtin rightclick, drop column in the edit table so I use that and realise it uses a drop index as well.

One thread might execute the method writer and another might execute the method reader. Because the writer method writes f after the objects constructor finishes, the reader method will be guaranteed to see the properly initialized value for f.x it will read the value 3.  However, f.y is not final the reader method is therefore not guaranteed to see the value 4 for it.p  pstrongMy question is  Isnt this a lame or at least a badly contrived example strong Or am I missing something here p  pMy reasoning to term the example as lame isp  pIf an object of FinalFieldExample class is to be shared by threads in a multithreaded scenario, shouldnt it follow the basic tenet of multithreading, which is to use some form of synchronization. If they had used synchronization, then the issue mentioned would not exist.p  pThe above example seems to advocate Final fields as an alternative or a partial pacifier to proper synchronization techniques. In my understanding, final fields have use even when used on top of proper synchronization. And should never be used to gain the advantage mentioned in the example in the absence of synchronization.p  pSo one could ask Isnt there a decent example with synchronization to explain the advantage of final fields over normal fields I guess, Immutability isp

Negative 9993 pI am using WPF 3D, but I think this question should apply to any 3d texture mapping.p  pSuppose I have a model of a cow, and I want to draw a circular spot on the cow and I want to do this dynamically  supposed I dont know the location of the spot until runtime. I could do this by coloring the vertexes vertexes are assigned a color based on their distance from the center of the spot, but if the model is fairly lowpoly, that will give a pretty jaggededged circle.p  pI could do it using a pixel shader, where the shader colors each pixel based on its distance from the center of the spot. But suppose I dont have access to pixel shaders since I dont in WPF.p  pSo, it seems that what I want to do is dynamically create a texture with the circle pattern on it, and texture the cow with it.p  pstrongThe question is As Im drawing that texture, how can I know what 3d coordinate in model space a given xy coordinate on the texture image corresponds tostrongp  pThat is, suppose I have already textured my model with a plain white texture  Ive set up texture coordinates, done texture mapping, but dont have the texture image yet. So I have this 1000x1000 or whatever pixel image that gets draped nicely over the cow according to some nice texture coordinates that have been set up on the model beforehand. I understand that when the 3D hardware goes to draw a given triangle, it uses the texture coordinates of the vertexes of the triangle to find the corresponding triangular region of the image, and then interpolates across the surface of the triangle to fill displayed model pixels with colors from that triangular region of the image.p  pHow do I go the other way How do I say, for this given xy point on my texture image, and given the texture coordinates that have already been set up on the model, whats the 3d coordinate in model space that this image pixel is going to correspond to once texture mapping happensp  pIf I had such a function, I could color my texture map image such that all the points in 3d space within a certain distance of the circle center point on the cow would get one color, and all points outside that distance would get another color, and Id end up with a nice, crisp circular spot on the cow, even with a relatively lowpoly model. Does that sound rightp  pI do understand that given the texture coordinates for the vertexes of each triangle, I can step through the triangles in my model, find the corresponding triangle on the texture image, and do my own interpolation, across the texture pixels in that triangle, by interpolating across the 3d plane determined by the vertex points. And that doesnt sound emtooem hard. But Im just trying to understand if there is some standard 3d conceptfunction where I can just call a readymade function to give me the model space coordinates for a given texture xy.p

Negative 9993 pI wish I could think of a better way to word my question, but basically here is what I want to do in an HTML file, I would like to fill the body with a specific string multiple times.

But obviously this is simpler than what Im intending to do, and right now what Im building, the order of all the content has not been decided yet, so things could move up or down in their placement on the page, but Id like all the numbers to be sequential in order of their appearance on the page.p  pSo, final thoughts I am super sure theres a way better way to do this than Im even thinking of, methodology wise i.e., make an XML table or something.

Negative 9993 pIm encountering the strange crash with combination of popToRootViewController and NavigationControllerDelegate. There are 3 tableViewControllers created in Storyboard. RootViewController     secondViewController     ThirdViewController Then I want to popToRootViewController on ThirdViewController. Popping works OK but crash immediately or when tap something else on the RootView. I found NavigationControllers childViewControllers were 0 right after popToRootViewController but when popping with back buttons one by one, it wont crash.p  pWhen I disabled the NavigationControllers delegate, it solves the crash and childViewControllers wont be 0. But I need NavigationController delegate to disable textfields delegate which Im using to validate user inputs. i.e. if user left mandatory textfield empty, navigationControllers delegate will disable the textfield delegate before pushpop the view to avoid alertView from being triggered by textfield delegate and this works OK.p  pHere is the NSLog outputs to show the childViewControllers count  0.

Negative 9993 h1What Im Doingh1  pI am currently working on strongcreating a SWIProlog module that adds tabcompletion capability to the swiplwin windowstrong. So far Ive actually gotten it to where it reads a single character at a time without stoppingreturning anything until a tab character is typed. I have also already written a predicate that returns all possible completions of an incompletely typed term by using substringmatching on a list of current terms obtained via codecurrentfunctor2code, codecurrentarithmeticfunction1code, codecurrentpredicate2code, etc [the predicate used will eventually be based off of context].p  pstrongIf you want to see my code, it is a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsqn246pndp0a08u8tabber.pl relnofollow titletabber.pl in my dropboxhereastrong...just keep in mind that Im not exactly a Prolog master yet friendly tips are more than welcome.p  hr  h1What Im Thinkingh1  pIve long abandoned any efforts at using XPCE to do popupdropdowncompletion in the swiplwin window Ill eventually try to get that into PceEmacs [it wont be as polished as Visual Studio picture something more like Pythons IDLE], but I dont know if thats really even practical since Im starting to use actual Emacs a lot more nowadays anyway, but strongis there any way to modify the output color in the swiplwin windowstrong I know syntax highlighting has already been implemented in other Prolog systems commandprompt windows, but strongI really just want to have it so that when tabber.pl suggests a completion, it also shows the arity and perhaps the rest of the partiallytyped term of the suggested term in light graystrong. strongI know there is already color output from the system like when it starts up, but I dont know how to hook into output stuff to control it myself.strong Obviously, Id probably define codeprint1code but... I know I could write my own SWIProlog console like one guy has done with C, but I really wanted it so people including me could just load the tabber module somewhere in their config file and continue to use the swiplwin window, rather than having it be a completely different executable... Would I have to use some kind of C APIp  pemstrongNotestrong The actual implementation will likely be influenced by the answers that I get to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17374014stringsvsatomsinswiprologtabcompletion titleStrings vs. Atoms in SWIProlog Tab Completionthis questiona, because Im going to base my decision on the use of strings andor atoms in this project off of them.emp  hr  h1What Im Askingh1  pstrongIs there a way or something even if its really lowlevel I can implement to colorize output in the swiplwin windowstrongp
Negative 9993 pIm putting together a calendarevents page using two columns.

Im setting a .current class on the previousnext selector, which works.. but the scrolling is a no go. Not getting any errors either.p  pThe line where it must be going wrong isp  precodecontainer.animate     scrollTop .current.offset.top                    container.offset.top                    container.scrollTop , 500 codepre  pIm fairly certain im just overlooking something simple, but if anyone has a suggestion as to what, Id very much appreciate itp  pstrongUpdatestrong Ive managed to find the issue with regards to the updown scrolling not working. I was referencing the wrong selector.p  pHowever, I now encounter a new problem. On first click up or down, nothing scrolls although the class current is properly set. On second click same direction things scroll, though the list will never reach the firstlast item. On clicking in the opposite direction, the list continues to scroll in the previous direction once, then continues to scroll in the correct direction.p  pI hope my description isnt causing confusion  Try the fiddle and youll probably see what I mean.p  pUpdated code can be found over at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net4E4V83 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net4E4V83a.p

Negative 9993 pIm attempting to make borderless forms that pop out of a tool bar. I want the user to be able to grab at the bottomright corner a resize handle and be able to resize the form, but not be able to resize or reposition the form in any other way.p  pIve heard that I can intercept the codeWMNCHITTESTcode message sent to the form and set its result to codeHTBOTTOMRIGHTcode which will let the operating system handle the resizing of the form, just as if it had a sizable frame. The idea I had was to detect if the mouse pointer had entered a box I defined in the corner and if it did then return the codeHTBOTTOMRIGHTcode result.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXcZLE.png altGraphic illustrating the resize handlep  pThis doesnt quite work as I expected it to.

Negative 9993 pI am implementing a UITableView with custom UITableViewCell. There is UIImageView there for displaying some image. But the api I am given , does not contain the download links of the images that Ill have to show in each UITableViewCell. For getting the images , Ill need to call another GET request that returns byte array stream of the image to be shown on the corresponding Cell.p  pI know , I can make an Image from NSData coming from the api. But I am not sure how much efficient idea that would be , I am worrying about memory and performance issue. And I want to do asynchronous loading in UITableViewCell and image cacheing also so that It take less time in later calls. So , what can be a efficient approach here  And also some suggestion about any good library that can help me doing this would be great.  p

Negative 9993 pI am working on a project for an ARM CortexM3 SiLabs SOC. I need to move the interrupt vector [edit] and code away from the bottom of flash to make room for a boot loader. The boot loader starts at address 0 to come up when the core comes out of reset. Its function is to validate the main image, loaded at a higher address and possibly replace that main image with a new one.p  pTherefore, the boot loader would have its vector table at 0, followed by its code. At a higher, fixed address, say 8KB, would be the main image, starting with its vector table.p  pI have found a hrefhttpinfocenter.arm.comhelpindex.jsptopiccom.arm.doc.dui0552aCiheijba.html relnofollowthis pagea which describes the Vector Table Offset Register which the boot loader can use with interrupts masked, obviously to point the hardware to the new vector table.p  pMy question is how to get the main image linked so that it will work when written to flash, starting not at zero. Im not familiar with ARM assembly but I assume the code is not position independent.p  pIm using SiLabss Precision32 IDE which uses gcc for the toolchain. Ive found how to add linker flags. My question is what gcc flags will provide the change to the base of the vector table and code.p  pThank you.p

Negative 9993 pMy R script is highly variable, so I have broken it up into a series of sourceed R files that are run by a controller script. If I want a script to run, I create an object and wrap the sourceed scripts with a conditional statement.

In order to run it in R, I have created an Rlauncher script where you can manually set the object parameters and source the controller script.

Negative 9993 pIm somewhat new to JavaScript and webbased programming, and a pet project Im working on would really benefit from replacing terriblelooking radio buttons with actual button selectors that worked the same way as radio buttons.  p  pA picture is worth a thousand words, but apparently I cannot post an image until my reputation increases, so let me try to describe this to you.p  blockquote   pA stronghoriozontal radio button liststrong is a list of text items, enumerated in   a horizontal row, with a selectable circle preceeding it.  If one   item is selected, the little circle preceeding it is filled in.    Only one item in the list can be selected at once.  p      pA stronghorizontal button selector liststrong is a horizontal grouping of buttons,   with text in the center of each button representing the item to be   selected.  When you select the button with the item in the center, the   button color changes somehow to show that it is the selected item.    Only one button in the group can be selected at once.p blockquote  pThe benefit of the button selection versus radio button selection is that it is easier for tablet and touchscreen users to select the items in a horizontal button selector list instead of a horizontal radio button list, and it is more visually appealing.p  pI have been able to figure out how to do vertical radio buttons, and horizontal radio buttons, but I want to extend the selector button idea and turn it into actual buttons.  Can anyone provide a starting point for this  I have over 30 topics needing selection, and I can have up to 20 items to select from for a single topic, so I want this to involve the least amount of coding as possible.  p  pThanksp

Im trying to authenticate a jQuery.ajax GET CORS request, like thisp  precode.ajaxhttphttpbin.orgbasicauthfoobar,      type GET,     username foo,     password bar,     xhrFields          withCredentials true      .thenfunction data      alertsuccess , function xhr      alertfailure  codepre  pbut the browser keeps prompting me for credentials, not sending the provided ones. Try this at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netBpYc3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netBpYc3a where a hrefhttphttpbin.org relnofollowhttphttpbin.orga is supposed to send correct CORS headers.p
Negative 9993 pHow can I replace only a part of a matched regex string  I need to find some strings that are stronginsidestrong of some brackets like codelt gtcode.

Do regular expressions or C allow that  And even if I solve the problem differently is it possible to match a big string but replace only a little part of it p

Negative 9993 pWe have Oracle ADF and SOA projects that are built using custom Ant scripts, instead of normal maven build. The same Ant plugin is configured differently for ADF and for SOA. The file structure isnt driven by the type of the project, but can be mixed, meaningp  precode parent pom      ADF      SOA type1      SOA type2 codepre  pHow can we set in the codepluginManagementcode different versions of Ant plugins, and the children to pick whatever type of Ant plugin they want. As I know you can only pick what plugins you want, but not what flavor of same plugin. I dont want to complicate my inheritance structure just for this. I need the structure to remain as it is, for release purposes.p  pThe same I want with properties, I want to have some types of properties in central places, and a project to be able to use them, but also inherit the parent pom for release purposes. Sort of like inherit from multiple parents.p  pI dont want to be tight by the need of properties and plugins which are general for all projects, not just mine. I need to keep my pom structure clean, for release purposes.p

Negative 9993 pMy asp.net MVC app has an area Company and an area Admin.p  pA company can do CRUD on its users in the company area. Ive created a UsersController for this in the Company area. An admin can do CRUD on a companys users in the Admin area. Ive created a CompanyUsersControllers for this in the Admin area.p  pBoth controllers have extremely similar code and I was wondering what the cleanest way is to reuse most of the code.p  pWhile writing this question, I figured I could create an abstract UsersControllerBase class with virtual ActionResults. I did this and it works for the Company area. I define attributes on the overriding methods in the UsersController class and call the corresponding abstract method in every overriding method.p  pHere is an example from the base classp  precode[UsersControllerBase.cs] public virtual ActionResult Editstring slug      var user  UserRepository.GetBySlugslug      if user.CompanyId  CurrentUser.CompanyId              throw new SecurityExceptionCurrentUser.Id   attempted to edit a user that does not belong to his company           var model  user.ToViewModel     AddListsTomodel      return Viewmodel  codepre  pAnd the corresponding overridep  precode[CompanyUsersController.cs] [HttpGet, GETcompanyusersslugedit] public override ActionResult Editstring slug      return base.Editslug  codepre  pThe problem is that the Edit in AdminCompanyUsersController.cs has an extra parameter companySlug which is used to find the company for which we are currently editing users.  As you can see in the code above, in CompanyUserscontroller.cs we simply derive the company from the CurrentUser.p  pWhat would be the best approach to handle this problemp  ptddr  I have 2 controllers with identically named actions that have nearidentical method bodies but different parameters. I want to reuse the code as much as possible. pls how do I c.p

Negative 9993 pI am trying to implement the UNIX type shell. I have not implemented the shell creating a child process to run each command part, but this is just a code to break the string entered at the command prompt by the user into the appropriate arguments by using a space as a delimiter, which will then be passed to the file corresponding to the command say ls l as command line arguments. p  pIt runs alright on my Windows 7 OS, but when I run it on Ubuntu with my input string as ABC XYZ WGH, I get an error, saying Undefined symbol printf version ABC.

Negative 9993 pI would like to have joomla automatically reindex all the articles that are in a certain category and subcategory without indexing the rest. I am not looking for a cron job. I want joomla to do this when I hit the indexing button. p  pIn other words, all the articles that are not in that particular category or its child subcategories should not be indexed and thus not show up in the search results.p  pEDIT more info This is for a specific site where I know the category ids. I should probably also add that it is a bilingual site, the search module is appearing and indexing twice on the same page for each language. I.e. it indexes and appears on the English blog page and the German blog page.p  pIs this possible or do I need to manually delete the indexed files I dont want to show upp  pstrongEDITstrong The discover tool is not working, here is the xml file to try and find out why.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltextension version3.1 typeplugin groupfinder methodupgradegt     ltnamegtplgfindercontentltnamegt     ltauthorgtJoomla Projectltauthorgt     ltcreationDategtAugust 2011ltcreationDategt     ltcopyrightgtC 2005  2014 Open Source Matters.

Negative 9993 pI am trying to migrate a PHP application that uses Twilio to Google Apps and have run into a bit of a snag. As a simple test, I sent a single text message to my cell phone from within the Google App that I created. It sends fine but I receive the message twice to confirm it was actually executing twice I sent the epoch time  theyre about 1 second apart. p  pI checked the logs and saw this  This request caused a new process to be started for your application, and thus caused your application code to be loaded for the first time. This request may thus take longer and use more CPU than a typical request for your application. I tried removing the Twilio usage entirely and replaced it with a simple Hello World echo, same message appeared in the log for that request.p  pHow can I avoid this sort of behaviorp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pHere are the headers from my Requestb.in test using the following code.

When you import a class and create an instance of that class you have access to its methods, can someone please explain to me how extending a class to provide those methods to your own class is effectively different, in other words, the only difference I see is that when you import you create an instance of a standardized class, and when you extend you effectively turn your personalized class into the standardized class only with a different name.  I am aware I am wrong, but the answers I have read have failed to help me fundamentally understand the difference.p

Negative 9993 pI have what I think is a simple scenario where I have to generate multiple textareas with RTE capability.

I have created a simple example MVC 4 app to try to get it all working before migrating my new knowledge to the real app. There are other items on this page that are all editable so it appears that the problem might stem from the html helper.

So  is there any way to do that Or  if no  what would be the best traditional way to do that SSDs, RAIDs, clusters with multiple nodesp  pThank youp

The LicenseValidator class doesnt give you methods for any other validation way.

Negative 9993 pI am creating a mobile app, using jQuery Mobile and Ajax calls to PHP. I have several mobile pages defined in the same phpfile that lets the user filter down on location, type of item etc using listviews.  On some of my PHP pages I am using forms in panels to add new records. Everything works fine except I cant figure out how to get back to the same page with the same selections, after I have added a record with a form POST In the normal selection workflow I use a Ajax call to populate the page in question with the correctly filtered data, based on the previous page, but to do that I would have to execute the jQuery Ajax function in my page when the page is created with PHP. To do that the only way I have come up with is to use the PHP header function and submit the search parameters in the URL and then catch these when the web page is created and dynamically create some type of javascript onload event that executes the Ajax function with the parameters I have submitted, but surely there must be a better way p

Negative 9993 pWhat methods are there to secure the dataflow between a data harvester server and multiple specific jsonp usersclients   p  pA simple example would be google webmaster tools . You get the js code for your domain, you put in your html file and data is harvested for your specific domain . Without proper security , one could generate headers, custom js parse the domain specific supplied js code by the data harvester to clone  your domain , and send data to google that would mess up the statistics of your contentuser actions .  p  pI was wodering if there is a client side solution, without any server side logic, curl requests for keys.

Negative 9993 pstrongEDITstrong tldr go to the first comment.p  pThis question stems from another question of mine a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24459360getmousedowneventwhenmousegoesdownonformborderGet MouseDown event when mouse goes down on Form bordera p  pIn that question I needed to have a form fire an event when the user pushed the left mouse button down on the form border preparing to drag, which works perfectly. The problem is when the user has finished this action, by letting go of the left mouse button, I would also like to have an event fired. p  pTo do so I produced this code to be placed in a base form class that other forms would be derived from. I have removed the codeFireMouseButton...code methods for succinctness they fire custom events. p  precodeconst int WMNCLBUTTONUP  0xA2 const int WMNCLBUTTONDWN  0xA1 protected override void WndProcref Message m      if m.Msg  WMNCLBUTTONUP         FireMouseButtonUp     if m.Msg  WMNCLBUTTONDWN         FireMouseButtonDown     base.WndProcref m  codepre  pThe problem with this is that the codeWMNCLBUTTONUPcode message is not sent as I expected it. After reviewing the description for codeWMNCLBUTTONUPcode I can see why though,p  blockquote   p[WMNCLBUTTONUP is] posted when the user releases the left mouse button while the cursor   is within the nonclient area of a window. This message is posted to   the window that contains the cursor. If a window has captured the   mouse, this message is not posted.p blockquote  pBecause the form has captured the mouse while it is being dragged, it will not receive the codeWMNCLBUTTONUPcode message. It will if the form is maximized though. This question explains it a little better a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions521147thecuriousproblemofthemissingwmnclbuttonupmessagewhenawindowisntmaThe curious problem of the missing WMNCLBUTTONUP message when a window isn39t maximiseda. p  pThe answer to that question is somewhat helpful but causes a lot of confusion for me. In the code below I have a small SSCCE, it implements some code given from the solution to the answer above, checking the codeWMNCHITTESTcode message to see if the mouse has been released p  pThe idea is that the codeWMNCHITTESTcode should be sent when the mouse is moving within the form. So once a drag stops this message should be sent with the mouse position as codeDragStartPointcode in the WndProc message arguments where codeDragStartPointcode is recorded when the codeWMNCLBUTTONDOWNcode message is received. p  pThe issue with this though is that the codeWMNCHITTESTcode is not always sent after the start of a drag, only when the drag is started on the far sides of the top border see pic below. The codeWMNCLBUTTONDOWNcode message is always sent when clicking on the top border never for sides or bottom. So that is fine, but the codeWMNCHITTESTcode and as pointed out codeWMNCLBUTTONUPcode are sent, but only sometimes. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0JitZ.png altenter image description herep  pHow might I get the codeWMNCHITTESTcode test to work in the code below so that I can be notified once the user has stopped dragging the form the test being checking the codeDragStartPointcode in the if statement for codeWMNCHITTESTcodep  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.ComponentModel using System.Data using System.Drawing using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Windows.Forms  namespace MouseEventTest      public partial class Form1  Form              Random rand  new Random          public Form1                      InitializeComponent                   const int WMNCHITTEST  0x84         const int WMNCLBUTTONUP  0xA2         const int WMNCLBUTTONDWN  0xA1          public Point DragStartPoint  get set          protected override void WndProcref Message m                      if m.Msg  WMNCLBUTTONUP                              label1.Text  Mouse Up On Border                          if m.Msg  WMNCLBUTTONDWN                              label1.Text  Mouse Down On Border                  Point pos  lParamToPointm.LParam                 DragStartPoint  this.PointToClientpos                  Console.Out.WriteLineDragStartPoint   DragStartPoint                           ifm.Msg  WMNCHITTEST                              Point pos  lParamToPointm.LParam                 Console.Out.WriteLineHtTestPnt   this.PointToClientpos                  if DragStartPoint  this.PointToClientpos                                      label1.Text  Mouse Up HitTest                                            base.WndProcref m                   private Point lParamToPointIntPtr lParamIn                      int x  lParamIn.ToInt32 amp 0x0000FFFF             int y  intlParamIn.ToInt32 amp 0xFFFF0000 gtgt 16             return new Pointx, y                    ltsummarygt          Required designer variable.          ltsummarygt         private System.ComponentModel.IContainer components  null           ltsummarygt          Clean up any resources being used.          ltsummarygt          ltparam namedisposinggttrue if managed resources should be disposed otherwise, false.ltparamgt         protected override void Disposebool disposing                      if disposing ampamp components  null                              components.Dispose                          base.Disposedisposing                   region Windows Form Designer generated code           ltsummarygt          Required method for Designer support  do not modify          the contents of this method with the code editor.          ltsummarygt         private void InitializeComponent                      this.label1  new System.Windows.Forms.Label             this.SuspendLayout                            label1                           this.label1.AutoSize  true             this.label1.Location  new System.Drawing.Point42, 30             this.label1.Name  label1             this.label1.Size  new System.Drawing.Size91, 13             this.label1.TabIndex  0             this.label1.Text  99999999999999                            Form1                           this.AutoScaleDimensions  new System.Drawing.SizeF6F, 13F             this.AutoScaleMode  System.Windows.Forms.AutoScaleMode.Font             this.ClientSize  new System.Drawing.Size185, 75             this.Controls.Addthis.label1             this.FormBorderStyle  System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.FixedToolWindow             this.Name  Form1             this.Text  Form1             this.ResumeLayoutfalse             this.PerformLayout                    endregion          private System.Windows.Forms.Label label1       codepre

Negative 9993 pI have been facing this issue since yesterday. I have made some changes in some of the files .js and .java files. p  pNow when I try to commit these changes using UI tool of Git for windowsGitHub, I get this message Binary Files Differ.. I have been working with these files successfully until now. I dont know how this problem has come up.p  pI searched net and found that may be GitHub is wrongly treating this file as Binary file due to mismatch of encoding. I checked the encoding of files that have this issue and found that they have the same UTF8 encoding that other files which have no issue have. p  pI also read that I can force git to treat the file as text file by specifying it in the .gitattributes file. But I dont know the location of this .gitattributes file. But I dont like this solution because this issue is there in many files and I find this as kind of a hack. I would like to know the cause of this and solve it properly.p  pHow can this issue be resolvedp
Negative 9993 pI have really terrible problem that makes me almost sick. For 23 days, Ive been dealing with this protocol issue and i find myself here to get some help from you guys. I hope Ill be solving. Thanks in advance. I had code in Vb that uses Old MsComm Library. So I decided to change all stuff with C. Im okey with opening , closing port and sending data etc. p  pIn Vb I have the following part of code which is for receiving data from Mbus driver via RS485.

However when I convert it to C like the following  I cant get response from mbus driver. While sending data via RS485, I can see that yellow led fires. Normally while receiving data, you can see that red led also fires.

Negative 9993 pIm attempting to write a small relay script in node.js that listens for incoming TCP connections on a local socket, and when it gets one, forwards the traffic to a 3rd party.

Ive tried code like a hrefhttpdelog.wordpress.com20110719atcprelaymechanismwithnodejs relnofollowhttpdelog.wordpress.com20110719atcprelaymechanismwithnodejsa and it does work, but it requires the sender be a server that is listening on a socket itself, and my utility is intended to work with any program that tries to create an outbound TCP connection. Unfortunately, the problem Im running into is that everything works great the first time with the client sending the data to the router program, and the router forwarding it to another server, and then returning the data from the client. However, when the client program ends or is terminated and attempts to reconnect, I get thisp  precodeevents.js72     throw er  Unhandled error event            Error This socket has been ended by the other party at Socket.writeAfterFIN [as write] net.js27512 at Socket.ltanonymousgt roottcploop.js3717 at Socket.emit events.js11720 at Socket.ltanonymousgt streamreadable.js74814 at Socket.emit events.js9217 at emitReadable streamreadable.js41010 at emitReadable streamreadable.js4065 at readableAddChunk streamreadable.js1689 at Socket.Readable.push streamreadable.js13010 at TCP.onread net.js52821 codepre  pI ripped out all of the logic and distilled the test case into a small bit of code one server that acts as both the router listening on port 8124 as well as the remote server on port 9999, though my testing indicates it makes no difference weather the remote server is on the same machine, on the Internet, etc. Here is the server codep  precodevar net  requirenet,     util  requireutil    The loopserver simulates a remote service.

Negative 9993 pMy last major experience with desktop gui programming was using cwpf in a mvvm fashion.  I added an observable collection that you didnt have to change on the main threadit was implemented by forwarding calls to an instance of the normal observable collection using locking and running on the gui thread when appropriate. Instead of gui event handlers where you play around with navigating the file tree I had methods in the viewmodel which only affected the viewmodel. I really like the fact that you could mostly contain the gui code with itself and that the view model code was mostly straightforward avoiding dealing with the view except by updating state and sending change events.p  pIm building a small self containedno dependencies if possible application using pyqt 4.6so I dont think qml is available, also qtwebkit seems to be a in a different package that isnt installed on these boxes.

Negative 9993 pMy googlefu is weak and cant seem to find an answer to this, though I am sure its out there.p  pSay you are using EF code first with lazy loading. You have a codeCustomercode entity and a codeCustomerTypecode entity. You want to format this info to a grid display where the codeCustomerType.Namecode is displayed in a model before passing to the view. You iterate through 10 customers, which have a total of 3 customer types. Once customertypeA is loaded into the context from 1 lazily loaded query, will EF still send another DB query when it comes across the same CustomerTypeId foreign key in the customerp  pI was recently learning about lazy loading vs eager loading. And I thought eager loading could help speed up some slow loading, but it in fact made them even slower. So I was wondering if something like first doing a query to just load all codeCustomerTypescode into the DbConext before iterating over codeCustomerscode would be possible to prevent 10 separate queries in the case of iterating over 10 customersp

Negative 9993 pFor a mobile Android application I have to do the same for iOS, but this question focuses on Android only I have to prevent data manipulation. Concrete I want to prevent that the user backups and restores the application directory and starts my application without an active data connection I have to allow offline mode to a certain grade so that I cannot detect inside my mobile application that the data is in an old state.p  pWith this attack the user is able to go back in time to an application state which brings him advantages. As a root user it is very easy to perform such a backuprestore attack with apps like Titanium Backup. However I do not want to block users with root I have also root on my phone nor do I want to block backups.p  pInstead I want to recognize a backuprestore attach my approach is to to link my application data lets focus on the database with an anchor pointp  ul lifor every relevant modification in the database I create an unique id which I store in the database inside the same transactionli lithe same unique id is stored as an anchor point somewhere in the systemli liwhenever the application starts, it compares the anchor point with the id inside the databaseli liif they are different I will not allow offline mode  the user has to go online to generate a valid database state  so the majority of the users can stay offline.li ul  pThis approach will protect me against the backuprestore attack only when the anchor point is not included in the backup which means it is hidden somewhere in the system security through obscurity  bad security or better stored in a systems registry which can only be modified by my application security by design.p  pSo the questions arep  ul liWhat is a good place  technique for storing an anchor pointli liWhat other approach could you recommend instead of using an anchor pointli ul  pThanks for your timep

Negative 9993 pI recently uploaded an update of my app to Google Play. When trying it out, I get an error when clicking on a manually added banner e.g. not AdMob or anything like that. The click is setting of an codeAsyncTaskcode that sends data to a phpscript using POST. I use ProGuard so when I send the error report to myself I am only able to see the method in which the error is caused doInBackground. I am also able to see that it is a codeNullPointerExceptioncode. The strange thing is, when I run the app on my device from my computer using Eclipse, the error doesnt occur, so I cant really find what line is causing the codeNullPointerExceptioncode.

Negative 9993 pI need a two dimensional array where the length of neither dimension is known at compile time. I want code[][]code access.p  pThere are several questions about this already, suggesting codeboostmultiarraycode, codestdvectorltstdvectorlttypegtgtcode, allocating one array for the x dimension and X arrays for the y dimension, so on and so forth.p  pThe catch is that I do not control the data, it already exists as a single contiguous array size codexycode. I have a pointer to it and the size of both dimensions, and I am more or less wrapping it to get code[][]code access.p  pI would like to avoid creating a whole bunch of objects like allocating an array of codestdvectorcodes and pointing them all at the right things, and boost.p  pI considered creating a class to hold both dimensions and the pointer, and overloading code[][]code, but that doesnt work because code[][]code is two operators, and the second code[]code applies to a different object.p  pUltimately Im looking for something that amounts to using code[][]code as syntactic sugar for some kind of codeaccessint x, int ycode function. Is that possiblep

Negative 9993 pIm building a set of code diagnostics using Roslyn in VS2015 Preview. Ideally, Id like any errors they produce to act as persistent errors, just as if I were violating a normal language rule.p  pThere are a bunch of options, but Im having a hard time getting any of them to work consistently. Ive managed to implement a rudimentary syntax node action, i.e. one registered with p  precodecontext.RegisterSyntaxNodeActionAnalyzeSyntaxNode, SyntaxKind.InvocationExpression codepre  pin the codeInitializecode method of my diagnostic class. Lo and behold, when I open up a file which violates this diagnostic while running the VSIX project, VS2015 shows an errorp  ul liRed squiggle under the right bit of codeli liRed block in the marginli liError in the error listli ul  pHowever, the error goes away when I close the file.p  pIve tried using codecontext.RegisterCompilationEndActioncode as well, but this has two problemsp  ul liIt seems to fire inconsistently. emUsuallyem when I open the solution it fires, but not always.

Whereas a similar codeReportDiagnosticcode call at the start of the method, or one per syntax tree with the file path, emdoesem get shown.pli ul  pWhat am I doing wrong here The first approach a syntax node action would be ideal if feasible  it gives me exactly the context I need. Is there some setting in the project properties that I need to make the compiler use that for full project compilation as well as just interactive in the IDE handling Is this perhaps just a bit of Roslyn integration which isnt quite finished yetp  pI can include the full code for the class if it would be useful  in this case I suspect it would be more noise than signal though.p

Negative 9993 pTo deepen my knowledge of I started attempting to create my own List class implementing from IEnumerable.. p  pLooking at the List implementation I see that it is using T[], I was hoping that I would be able to implement my own version of the [], which would find available memory, see how much space my object takes up by adding up the sizes of the properties on the class i.e. 2 int properties 32  32 bits and allocate this object to memory with a bit of extra space for other values like space for a pointer to the next location in memory for the next item.. p  pIs this possible in C or by using unmanaged code and creating a wrapper class to use it in C.. is this what [] is doing.. I have searched online for implementing [] manually and cannot find any good resources, also browsing to the definition is not possible.. I have added c and c tags because it might be possible to create a solution in those languages and import the dlls for use in C.. How could I implement this functionality and use it in Cp  pUpdatep  pThe question is focused towards what are the options available in C for implementing lower level functionality for example putting objects to and removing them from memory manually. For example not using the [] property given in C but creating that functionality myself.. Look at the implementation of List and how it uses [].. The reason I am wondering this is because I am exploring how low level C lets us go to access memory ect.. What options do we have to do this, Ive seen that there are windows apis Win32 APIs maybe this is how to achieve this functionality or can this functionality be implemented in an unmanaged language and imported using dllimport, any advice on suggested approaches or further resources would be appreciatedp

Since oncomplete doesnt trigger in my case I had to find a way around it but I am really not sure how bullet proof is the way I implemented. not to mention that it is quite troublesome to implement it all over the placep  pWhat I did so far was to have the commandLinks action point to the beans method that does everything except returning the new navigation page and on oncomplete event to run my JS function with the updated JSON object then call a previously declared jsFunction that all it does is to return the navigation page. p  pIt works ok, I guess, but I was wondering if theres an official proper way to do it like forcing the oncomplete or similar event that comes after the action where I can use javascript.p  pHeres the examplep  precodelta4jform idmyFormgt             lta4jjsFunction namemoveToNextPage actionnextpagegt       lta4jcommandLink actionmyBean.doLogicAndUpdateJSON             oncompletecallJSfunctionmyBean.objJSONmoveToNextPagegt       lta4jcommandLinkgt lta4jformgt codepre  pThanksp
Negative 9993 pThis seems a question with many answers already however, I cant find a common approach to this. Im trying to add data to a codeListViewcode when the bottom is reached data are retrieved from Internet using an codeAsyncTaskcode. codeListViewcode already has an adapter attached to it.p  pSo, searching for a good way to accomplish this, I arrived at two different approaches.p  ol liThe first one, the codeonScrollStateChangedcode approach, is basically related to a hrefhttpmarteinn.seblogandroiddeterminatewhenscrollviewhasreachedthebottom relnofollowthisa page. However, it use parameters that dont have correspondence in the actual API. At the same time, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma238075032326627thisa link use the right API, but I dont know if in the right way. I tried with the first of the two links, but its kind of meh. Debugging the app, codediffcode values vary a lot and I dont know how to correctly interpet the expression. Also, I dont know how to fix an offset from which I can start to retrieving data I mean, Id like to execute code not when Im about to reach the bottom, but just before I reach it. Also, sometimes it get called even if we scroll to the top.li liThe second one is the codeonScrollcode approach, that is used in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma51239032326627thisa answer or, in a different way, in a hrefhttpsgist.github.commarteinn3757968 relnofollowthisa code. I tried adapting the last of the two codes, but it cause many problems and the data are loaded even if we dont reach the bottom of the list.li ol  pSo, what approach is best When and why should I prefer one or the other Which of the two should I use in my casep

Negative 9993 pI need to use an environment variable to configure MapServer a hrefhttpmapserver.org relnofollowhttpmapserver.orga a C program that can run as a FastCGI application in IIS. p  pThe code uses the C getenv function to get this variable. p  precodeconst char pszCurlCABundle  NULL pszCurlCABundle  getenvCURLCABUNDLE codepre  pI have set the System Environment variable in Windows and rebooted.

Negative 9993 pTheres any way to implement a strongimplicitstrong conversion from codestringcode to codebooleancode using codeCcodep  pE.g. I have the string str with value emYem and when I try convert cast to codebooleancode it must returns me codetruecode.p
Negative 9993 pi am working on an iOS app which is able to make videos out of single screenshots. I therefore need things like codeCVPixelBufferRefcode, codeCGContextRefcode and codeAVAssetWritercode. Currently the app is working fine but there is one thing I do not understandp  pFor example, codeCVPixelBufferRefcode is a reference to a Core Video image buffer and is part of the codeCoreVideocode framework which I havent linked to my app.  The same applies to codeCGContextRefcode which is part of the codeCoreGraphicscode framework which I also havent linked. Or codeCABasicAnimationcode which is part of the codeQuartzCorecode frameworkp  pHow is it possible that my app is working fine, without essential frameworks Do I no longer need to link these frameworksp  pI would appreciate any hint.p  pThank youp
Negative 9993 pI am trying to center align the values for my table header cells cow and heifer. Programatically I have already done this for the table rows, but for some reason it wont do this for the header rows. Im doing this for each individual cell because I dont want the first column measurements to be centered.

Negative 9993 pIm trying to write a quick script to output a sequence. The sequence begins is as follows 1,11,21,1211,111221,312211... starts with 1, then as 1 1 the second term is 11, as two 1s third term is then 21s ect.p  pI have written a script below which outputs the terms in this sequence. It outputs the correct next term when the inputstring is 1, ie 11. But ALL terms after then output as 11 too..... if I manually set the input to 11, then all the terms are calculated correctly.p  pThis makes no sense, as with the initial input of code1code my codetotalsequence[0]code variable will be code1code, giving the correct output of code11code.  The next term will then have codetotalsequence[1]code as its input, which is code11code i.e. the last iterations output.  But this gives code11code as its output.  If I directly put code11code in as the totalsequence[1] term instead of referencing codetotalsequence[1]code  which  code11code then the correct output is then given.p  pSo basically why is codeinputstring  11code different to codeoutput[1]code where codeoutput  [1,11]codep  precodeinputstring 1 N5 totalsequence  [inputstring]  for i in xrange0,N,1         Ncounter  int0     previouschar       outputstring       characterindex  int1      loop through each character in the current sequence term     for currentchar in totalsequence[i]         if first character         if  characterindex  1             Ncounter  1         if last character         if characterindex  leninputstring             if currentchar  previouschar                 Ncounter  Ncounter  1              if currentchar  previouschar                 if previouschar                     outputstring   outputstring  str Ncounter   str previouschar                  Ncounter  int 1                  outputstring   outputstring  str Ncounter   str currentchar           if neither first nor last character         if characterindex  1 and characterindex  leninputstring              if currentchar  previouschar                 Ncounter  Ncounter  1              if currentchar  previouschar                 outputstring   outputstring  str Ncounter   str previouschar                  Ncounter  int 1           characterindex  characterindex  1         previouschar  currentchar      totalsequence.append outputstring    print totalsequence codepre

I just cant figure out what is telling the canvas to jump to 0,0 when log shows the translate value has not changed.  p  pHere is a sample of one of my many headbanging triesp  precodeboolean doTouchEventMotionEvent ev           synchronized gvSurfaceHolder              mScaleDetector.onTouchEventev                 float x  ev.getX0             float y  ev.getY0            get pointer index from the event object             int pointerIndex  ev.getActionIndex               get pointer ID             int pointerId  ev.getPointerIdpointerIndex              switch ev.getAction amp MotionEvent.ACTIONMASK                  case MotionEvent.ACTIONDOWN                         contact  false                                  mLastTouch handles the finger position for moving the sprites                      translate handles where to move the whole screen when NOT touching sprites                      mLastTouchX  x  mScaleFactor                     mLastTouchY  y  mScaleFactor                    We assign the current X and Y coordinate of the finger to startX and startY minus the previously                    translated amount for each coordinates This works even when we are translating the first                    time because the initial values for these two variables is zero.                                 startX  x  previousTranslateX                   startY  y  previousTranslateY                          detectPCTouch                   if contact                      mLastTouchX  startX  mScaleFactor                      mLastTouchY  startY  mScaleFactor                   testVarDumpDown, pointerIndex, pointerId                           break                  case MotionEvent.ACTIONPOINTERDOWN                        stopTranslate  true                      testVarDumpACTION Pointer DOWN, pointerIndex, pointerId                     break                  case MotionEvent.ACTIONMOVE                                        x  ev.getX0                     y  ev.getY0                     testVarDumpACTION Move, pointerIndex, pointerId                      Only move if the ScaleGestureDetector isnt processing a gesture.                     if mScaleDetector.isInProgress                         if contact                         translateX  x  startX                         translateY  y  startY                         mLastTouchX  x  mScaleFactor                         mLastTouchY  y  mScaleFactor                         else                             translateX  previousTranslateX                             translateY  previousTranslateY                             mLastTouchX  x  previousTranslateX  mScaleFactor                             mLastTouchY  y  previousTranslateY  mScaleFactor                                                                                          break                    case MotionEvent.ACTIONPOINTERUP                      contact  false                     stopTranslate  true                     testVarDumpACTION Pointer UP, pointerIndex, pointerId                     break                  case MotionEvent.ACTIONUP                                       All fingers went up, so lets save the value of translateX and translateY into                       previousTranslateX and previousTranslate                        if contact                                           previousTranslateX  translateX                         previousTranslateY  translateY                     else                           translateY  previousTranslateY                         translateX  previousTranslateX                                           contact  false                     stopTranslate  falsetestVarDumpACTION Up, pointerIndex, pointerId                     break                                               return true      codepre  pThe run blockp  precodeOverride     public void run          while running              Canvas c  null             try                  c  gvSurfaceHolder.lockCanvasnull                  synchronized gvSurfaceHolder                                              c.save                     c.scalemScaleFactor, mScaleFactor                     If translateX times 1 is lesser than zero, lets set it to zero.

Where you need to copy and paste it into the field.p  pDoes anyone know how to get this done Thanksp

Negative 9993 pThe problem Im having is quite specific, usually Id be able to figure it out myself, but since it only occurs on mobile and chrome device mode I think I need some help.

Negative 9993 pI want to know if there are some keywords to study the following issuep  hr  pSearching K characters in a dictionary like LZ77 and find out all their matching length and index at the same time. For instance,p  precode           char A B C D E F G H I J    match length 4 2 1 3 3 5 2 1 2 1           index 2 5 7 0 9 1 3 4 8 6 codepre  pIf I want to know how many codes will be output, there are some ways to group them. The most intuitive way is select the index from char[0] and group them by the matching length. So it will be p  precode           char A B C D E F G H I J    match length 4    3   1 2            index 2    9   4 8   codepre  pThe code made by index, len will be 2,4,9,3,4,1,8,2. The code number is four.p  pOr the characters can be grouped by the length no bigger than the matching length, say,p  precode           char A B C D E F G H I J    match length 4    1 5               index 2    9 1     codepre  pThe code made by index, len will be 2,4,9,1,1,5, which can output less code number than the previous way.p  hr  pI know there are still many methods to select the output codes, and there are some benefit for the choosing methods. complexity, speed, minimal output code...p  pMy question is, are there some algorithms discussing this kind of selection issue Or some keywords I can look for Its really confusing if I cant get the searching keyword, then I wont be able to begin the study.p  pThank you for the helpp

Variations are stored in a seperate table as individual rows. p  pI fetch the records into a dictionary using serializers as a result of which I get a nested structure. For indexing in Elastic Search I want a flatter json structure the document is already quite nested, I want to avoid more nesting levels. So before indexing I want to collect the various variation attributes into their individual lists. p  pFor example p  precodeDishname Pasta variationnames [Chicken, Lamb] codepre  pI wrote it in the most obvious way p  precodefor dish in restaurantdict[restaurantdishes]         id, dishname, standarddishname         dishname  dish[dishname]          for variation in dish[dishvariations]             dishvariations.appendvariation[variety]    dishname             dishvariationnames.appendvariation[variety]             servingsizes.appendvariation[servingsize]             numberofpieces.appendvariation[numberofpieces]             unitprice.appendvariation[unitprice]             quantity.appendvariation[quantity]          dish.popdishvariations, None          dish[dishvariations]  dishvariations         dish[dishvariationnames]  dishvariationnames         dish[servingsizes]  servingsizes         dish[numberofpieces]  numberofpieces         dish[unitprice]  unitprice         dish[quantity]  quantity codepre  pIs there a better way to write thisp

Negative 9993 pI am trying to write C code that takes serialport data from a high speed GPS device and parse the data to grab coordinates. p  pThe problem with this compared to other serial GPS devices is that it spits out 56 lines of data every 100 milliseconds instead of the same every second. So basically, every 0.1 seconds, I get 5 or 6 lines of data burst, which will last continuously as long as the device is turned on. p  pWhen I tried it on a simulated standardspeed GPS device, it works just fine. p  pThis is me getting a 5 line burst once every second. But when it speeds up 10 fold, it stops working. Basically, I get the effect of codeSerialDataReceivedEventHandlercode not triggering at all. p  pSo what is the best way to get a continuous read on what is essentially a superfast serialport dump of datap  pMy code is below.

The answer depends on the values tresh1 e tresh2 of course.p  pSuppose I have 100 DATASETs avaiable and I know which ones are good and which are not.

Hence I select a region where tresh1 and tresh2 values are good. Is that a good method Are there better onesp  pIn general, it seems to me a parameters calibration problem.
