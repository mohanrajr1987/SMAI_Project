Positive 88865 pThis code is a little wild but I am more concerned about concepts here than definite code responses. I am working on a combat system for a game. I have npc characters running on an attack loop. Once the player has reduced an npc bad guys hit points to zero, I want to remove that entity from the mapDOMscope etc.  ...some code the code in question will be towards the end p  pLoading the npc character data from database..an array, all same properties, but different values. scope.encounters gets ngrepeated in the HTML and builds out the characters on the screen.

This is still receiving the data of one npc entity. Each enemy has different attacks, so basically, this is getting that certain NPCs attacks data from the database, then randomizing which attack will get used, it then calculates whether or not the attack will hit the player character.

I tried to change that to NULL, figuring it would eliminate the entitys data, hence not being able to do anything. Also just tried removing the element from the DOM, which of course, removes it from the screen, but then it keeps running attacks.  In parent of the scope, I can see the scope.attack function..I changed that to NULL, but then that stops all of the NPCs from attack. p  pWhat I need to do is kill the attack function for the specific NPC...but when I console scope, it looks to me like there is only 1 attack function in the scope, not seperate ones for each encounter entitynpc.p  pIs there some way I can code the attack function to be attack to the main scope of each of these elements Maybe an isolated scope which I dont really understand what it is p  pThis is my learning AngularJS project...so any advice on a better way to accomplish the above and also to eliminate the NPC from the battle after its be killed would be really great.

Is there any solution to show the html page only when data comes from the server.p  pBelow is my javascript file fileBrowser.jsp  precodevar fileBrowserModule  angular.modulefileBrowser, [agGrid]  fileBrowserModule.controllerfileBrowserController, functionscope, http       scope.rowData[                 ]      http.gethttplocalhost8080KKRflowsinallSins.json     .successfunctiondata        scope.rowDataJSON.parse[JSON.stringifydata]         console.logscope.rowData              scope.rowData[                 grouptrue,datanamejoe,     children[                 grouptrue,datanamepat,                     children[grouptrue,                         datanamemaya,                         children[groupfalse,                             datanamebrook,                             children[],grouptrue,                                 datanamekery,                                 children[groupfalse,                                     datanamesantosh,                                     children[]]]],                                     groupfalse,                                         datanamearavind,children[]]  ]                   var columnDefs  [         headerName Name, field name, width 250,             cellRenderer                  renderer group,                 innerRenderer innerCellRenderer             ,         headerName Size, field size, width 70, cellStyle sizeCellStyle,         headerName Type, field type, width 150,         headerName Date Modified, field dateModified, width 150        ]      scope.gridOptions           columnDefs columnDefs,         rowData scope.rowData,         rowSelection multiple,         rowsAlreadyGrouped true,         enableColResize true,         enableSorting true,         rowHeight 20,         icons              groupExpanded lti classfa faminussquareogt,             groupContracted lti classfa faplussquareogt         ,         onRowClicked rowClicked           scope.selectedFile  Select a file below...        function rowClickedparams          var node  params.node         var path  node.data.name         while node.parent              node  node.parent             path  node.data.name    path                  scope.selectedFile  path           function sizeCellStyle          return textalign right           function innerCellRendererparams          var image         if params.node.group              image  params.node.level  0  disk  folder          else              image  file                  var imageFullUrl  examplefilebrowser  image  .png         return ltimg srcimageFullUrl stylepaddingleft 4px gt   params.data.name        codepre  pBelow is my html filep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt lthead langengt     ltmeta charsetUTF8gt      lt Bootstrap gt     ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpsmaxcdn.bootstrapcdn.combootstrap3.3.1cssbootstrap.min.cssgt     ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpsmaxcdn.bootstrapcdn.combootstrap3.3.1cssbootstraptheme.min.cssgt     ltlink hrefmaxcdn.bootstrapcdn.comfontawesome4.2.0cssfontawesome.min.css relstylesheetgt     ltlink hrefstylesangularfileBrowser.css relstylesheetgt      ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srchttpsmaxcdn.bootstrapcdn.combootstrap3.3.1jsbootstrap.min.jsgtltscriptgt   lt   ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsangularjs1.3.8angular.min.jsgtltscriptgt   gt       ltscript src httpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsangularjs1.4.7angular.jsgtltscriptgt       lt you dont need ignorenotused in your code, this is just here to trick the cache gt     ltscript srcscriptsangularaggrid.jsignorenotused10gtltscriptgt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstylesangularaggrid.cssignorenotused10gt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstylesangularthemefresh.cssignorenotused10gt      ltscript srcscriptsangularfileBrowser.jsgtltscriptgt  ltheadgt  ltbody ngappfileBrowsergt      ltdiv ngcontrollerfileBrowserController          styleborder 1px solid darkgrey                 width 600px                 backgroundcolor lightgrey                 borderradius 5px                 padding 3pxgt         ltdiv styleborder 1px solid darkgrey marginbottom 2px backgroundcolor whitegt ampnbsp selectedFileltdivgt         ltdiv stylewidth 100 height 400px              aggridgridOptions              classagfilebrowsergt         ltdivgt      ltdivgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Positive 88865 pBack for another Angular question. I am working on a directive that uses d3.charts provided by the miso project, and have been running into issues. I am trying to set up an on click event during the insert portion of the lifecycle. This on click event will change the state to a new view and controller. So far the click takes me to an empty page with the same url parameters, but when I click elsewhere on the page it updates the url and changes the view. Let me set up an example. p  precodevar d3  required3 require...thechart ngInject var genericDirective  functionstate   return     restrict A,     scope       directive arguments         ,   templatesome template   link functionscope, element   chart design logic  ......  var chart  d3.selectelement[0]    .appendsvg    other chart things ...    .onclick, functiondata      state.go myState, someArgs data        .chartbring in theChart      chart attributes....        chart.drawscope.data      codepre
Positive 88865 pI have a page where there is a header with data to be displayed and there is a list of tabs dynamicaly displayed below the header. Data in tabs is related to header.

Negative 88865 pSomething keeps showing up in my programming, and it is that two things are the same from some viewpoint, but different from another. Like, imagine you build a graph of rail stations, connected by trains, then the classes Vertex and RailStation are sometimes the same, other times not. p  pSo, imagine I have a graph that very much represents rail stations and trains. Then I hand this graph to another object, which deletes some vertices, and then I want the corresponding rail stations to be gone. p  pI dont want to make rail stations properties of vertices, theyre not. Also, the problem is symmetrical If I erase a railstation, I want the corresponding vertex to be gone. What is the proper OO way to model or correspondences. Im willing to go a few extra miles by writing some support methods or classes, if in the end the overall usage is simple and easy.p  pIm currently using the Smalltalk programming language, but the question isnt really smalltalkspecific, I think. I just mention it because in Smalltalk, you can do cool tricks like examining the call stack, which might be helpful in this context.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Well, RailStations arent Vertices Are theyp  pOk, let us consider real code, as demanded in the answers. Let me model a person with children. Thats the easiest thing, right Children should also know their parents, so we have like a doubly linked tree. To make disbanding parents from children easier, I model the link between parent and child as a Relationship, with properties parent and child.p  pSo, I could implement parentremoveChild perhaps like thisp  precoderemoveChild aChild     parent relationshipWith aChild disband. codepre  pSo, a parent has a collection of relationships, not of children. But each relationship emcorrespondsem to a child. Now I want to do things like thisp  precodeparent children removeAllSuchThat [e e age lt 12] codepre  pwhich should remove the relationship emandem the child.p  pHere, relationships and children correspond in some sense. So, what do I do now Dont get me wrong, Im fully aware that I could solve the problem without introducing Relationship classes. But indeed, parents and children actually do share a relationship, so why not model that and use it to help disbanding double links less imperativelyp

My ideas werep  p1 Use the Google Calendar API to link each appointment made to the doctors  personal Google Calendar. If he then syncs his mobile phone to Google  Calendar, hell have it synched. The disadvantage to this is that wed have  to store the doctors Google userpassword in our database app, and that  theyd have to have a Google account, as it would only work with that.p  p2 Sending an iCalendar email every time an appointment is made to the  doctors email address. Is this a good way to do it Theyd have to first  use an email client such as Outlook or iPhone email to accept the email  appointment request. And if they used Outlook to accept it, theyd have to  have their mobile phone synced to their Exchange server, etc.  Is there any  sample PB.NET code on doing this I know how to send out emails, but I would like help on sending an iCalendar email.p  pAny feedbacksuggestions such as a good websitetool to visitcheck on is  welcome. p

Negative 88865 pOk... I have created a web application using Visual Studio 2008  using C..p  pNow i need to secure this website for that i need to add a login page.p  pI am not using the login control of visualstudio.. i am just entering the username and password and there is an API which returns true or false after authentication...p  pIf it returns true the user is allowed to access my application and if false an error page is displayed...

So i dont want this to happen instead if this is typed an error page should open. But if the user goes to the login page and logs in then only it should open these pages....p  pAny suggestions on how to achieve this.. thanksp

These images are expensive to generate. So, the first request will generate and cache the image, and we want to put the other requests on hold while generating.p  p2 We have not tried to reproduce  at the moment were trying to know if it is possible or not that the emsameem thread begins processing a request while already waiting for the image to become ready.p  p3 I am aware of the LockPolicyRecursion but I am not sure I fully understand its purpose, and whether it would be OK to set it to SupportsRecursion in our case.p  pstrongeditstrong going further...p  pAccording to the document pointed to by Ryan below, a thread will block and not return to the pool as long as we dont engage into async operations. So once weve locked the thread waiting for EnterReadLock to complete, it wont return to the pool nor process any other request.p  pSo 1 we should be safe but 2 we might starve the thread pool.

Negative 88865 pIm trying to get what I call measurement units system by wrapping double into struct. I have C structures like Meter, Second, Degree, etc. My original idea was that after compiler is inlined everything I would have a performance the same as if double were used.p  pMy explicit and implicit operators are simple and straightforward, and compiler does actually inline them, yet the code with Meter and Second is 10 times slower than the same code using double.p  pMy question is being why cannot C compiler make the code using Second as optimal as the code using double if it inlines everything anywayp  pSecond is defined as followingp  precodestruct Second      double value  no more fields.      public static Second operator  Second left, Second right                return left.value  right.value           public static implicit Second operator double value                 This seems to be faster than having constructor          return new Second  value  value             plenty of similar operators  codepre  pUpdatep  pI didnt ask if struct fits here. It does.p  pI didnt ask if code is going to be inlined. JIT does inline it.p  pI checked assembly operations emitted in runtime. They were different for code like thisp  precodevar x  new double for var i  0 i lt 1000000 i       x  x  2      Many other simple operator calls here  codepre  pand like thisp  precodevar x  new Second for var i  0 i lt 1000000 i       x  x  2      Many other simple operator calls here  codepre  pThere were no call instructions in disassembly, so operations were in fact inlined. Yet the difference is significant. Performance tests show that using Second is like 10 times slower than using double.p  pSo my questions are attention why is JIT generated IA64 code is different for the cases above What can be done to make struct run as fast as double It seems there no theoretical difference between double and Second, what is the deep reason of difference I sawp

Negative 88865 pI have a rather large application which, on the admin frontend, takes a few seconds to load a page because of all the pageviews that it has to load into objects before displaying anything. Its a bit complex to explain how the system works, but a few of my other questions explains the system in great detail. The main difference between what they say and the current system is that the customer frontend no longer loads all the pageviews into objects when a customer first views the page  it simply adds the pageview to the database and creates an object in an unsynchronised list... to put it simply, when a customer views a page it no longer loads all the pageviews into objects but the admin frontend still does.p  pI have been working on some admin tools on the customer frontend recently, so if an administrator clicks the description of an item in the catalogue then the right hand column will display statistics and available actions for the selected item. To do this the page which gets loaded through codeactioncontainer.loadbla bla blacode into the right hand column has to loop through ALL the pageviews  this ultimately means that ALL the pageviews are loaded into objects if they havent been already. For some reason this loads really REALLY fast. The difference in speed is only like a second on my dev site, but the live site has thousands of pageviews so the difference is quite big...p  pSo my question is why is it that the admin frontend loads so slowly while using codebla.loadblacode is so fast I mean whatever method jQuery uses, cant browsers use this method too and load pages superfast Obviously not as someone wouldve done that by now  but I am interested to know just why the difference is so big... is it just my system or is there a major difference in speed between the browser getting a page and jQuery getting a page Do other people experience the same kind of differencesp  pThanks in advance,p  pRegards,p  pRichardp

Negative 88865 pFirst off, Im totally brand new to any kind of coding.  I started trying to make an app with App Inventor, but it became too big for that and couldnt do exactly what I was wanting.  So now Im attempting to do it all from scratch.p  pI think Im getting things figured out, but Id like to check and see if this makes sense before I got and build the whole thing.p  pWhat Im aiming for is a main screen with a bunch of buttons on it.  Each of those buttons will take you to a set of directions that is a series of pictures and text that you can flip through.  p  pWhat Im thinking is to make an activity for the main screen and one for each set of directions.  On the main one, I put a table layout which contains all the buttons.  Each of the directions sets will be its own activity with a view flipper to go through all the picstext.p  pDoes that make sense  Is there a better way to do this or is this good  Thanksp

Negative 88865 pUnless Im missing something which is very possible, it seems to me that custom validation has always violated DRY.  In all the examples Ive seen, even with the brand new Unobtrusive Client Validation introduced w MVC 3, we have to create .NET code for our serverside validation, and jQuery or JavaScript code for clientside validation.p  pI understand that theres no such thing as a .NETtojQuery translator that would facilitate DRY serverclient validation, and I guess that would be the only way to have true DRY validation that works both server and client side.p  pBut I would be perfectly content with having custom validation always performed on the server.  The data needed to pass into custom validation in my case is usually limited to one or two fields, and the serverside logic is usually pretty quick, even if it has to hit the database.p  pIs there no OOTB mechanism for wiring up custom validation using attributes, then having your client side validation use Ajax to execute the validation serverside and respond to the client  Or, has someone come up with such a solutionp  pOr is it a matter of, in the end, the tradeoffs of repeating the custom validation is better than the issues introduced w always executing custom validation server sidep  pThanks in advance.p

I will never have phone numbers that do not belong to a User, so would it make sense to do away with the PhoneRepository and incorporate phone related methods into the UserRepository  Assuming the answer is yes, Im going to rewrite the prior code sample.p  pAm I allowed to have a method on the UserRepository that returns phone numbers Or should it always return a reference to a User, and then traverse the relationship through the User to get to the phone numbersp  precodeListltPhonegt phones  UserRepository.GetPhoneNumbersuserId  Or User user  UserRepository.GetUserWithPhoneNumbersuserId this method will join to Phone codepre  pRegardless of which way I acquire the phones, assuming I modified one of them, how do I go about updating them  My limited understanding is that objects under the root should be updated through the root, which would steer me towards choice 1 below.  Although this will work perfectly well with Entity Framework, this seems extremely undescriptive, because reading the code I have no idea what Im actually updating, even though Entity Framework is keeping tab on changed objects within the graph.p  precodeUserRepository.Updateuser  Or UserRepository.UpdatePhonephone codepre  pLastly, assuming I have several lookup tables that are not really tied to anything, such as codeCountryCodescode, codeColorsCodescode, codeSomethingElseCodescode.  I might use them to populate drop downs or for whatever other reason.  Are these standalone repositories  Can they be combined into some sort of logical groupingrepository such as codeCodesRepositorycode  Or is that against best practices.p

Negative 88865 pi am using visual studio 2010 C, .NET 4 to create a setup wizard project. i need to make sure the application a windows form application starts after it installs. towards this goal, i have specified a custom action. in particular, what i do is inside the windows form application project extend the System.Configuration.Install.Installer class inside this classs constructor, i add a new event handler to the Comitted event. the event handler simply calls System.Diagnostics.Process.Startstring path, where path is the path to the executable file. p  pnow back in the setup wizard project, under Custom Action  Commit, I add the primary output from the windows form application. p  pthis works somewhat, but not really. when i run the setup wizard when i actually try to install, the wizard progresses almost all the way through, starts up the windows form, but then never exits and moreover, the progress bar never quite reaches 100. unless i exit the windows form application, then the installer hangs in this state.p  pive done quite a few search on the internet and tried different combinations i.e. put the code to Process.Start in different events with placing the custom action in Install vs Commit, but some of the flat out fail. i can provide references if needed.p  panyone have any pointers on how to use visual studio 2010s setup wizard to start up a windows form application successfully and exit itselfp

Negative 88865 pHey Mr. Stack overflow I am trying to have different information display in the same block depending on a variable choice which is simply an int.

For some reason it doesnt seem to care about the code if code statement that is checking where the code block code is supposed to go.  I thought that the code if code statement would only execute what was inside itself depending on its parameters but it doesnt seem to be doing that. It displays everything inside the code if code no matter what choice1 is equal too   Does anyone have any idea how I might be able to fix this  Thanks p

Negative 88865 pIm working under Visual Studio 2008, maybe thats important. In a larger project I decided to split one of my .cpp files into two. As I moved some of the functions to a new file, lets call it codenew.cppcode, and tried to compile, I got errors that codenew.cppcode doesnt know definitions of codefstreamscode, codesetwcode, etc. Now, at the very top of the new file I included my own header, lets call it codemainheader.hcode, which in turn includes all the necessary codeltiostreamgtcode, codeltiomanipgtcode, etc. This works just fine all throughout older files used in this project, but for some reason doesnt in codenew.cppcode. p  pIf I add p  precodeinclude ltfstreamgt include ltiomanipgt  and all the rest codepre  pin codenew.cppcode then all works just fine, but thats not how I want to solve it. I thought maybe content of codemainheader.hcode doesnt get appended to codenew.cppcode on compilation, but thats not true, I tried using in codenew.cppcode an external variable declared in codemainheader.hcode and defined in yet different .cpp, and got no errors on compilation, linking, or running. Yet it seems like codeltfstreamgtcode and codeltiomanipgtcode included in codemainheader.hcode do not make it to codenew.cppcode file. p  pIm relatively new to Visual Studio, so the solution to my problem is likely something silly Im not aware of, but I spent a good while trying to figure this one out and to no avail. The new file is definitely part of the project, since building projects attempts to compile it, plus once I include codeiostreamcode and codeiomanipcode in this codenew.cppcode I can call its routines in other parts of the project. Any ideas what I might be doing wrongp  pcodemainheader.hcode looks like thatp  precodeifndef MAINHEADER define MAINHEADER  include ltiomanipgt include ltfstreamgt  loads of other stuff  endif   for MAINHEADER codepre  pbrbr Update Ok, so the day after I created a whole new project using the same files and now all works fine, I dont need to include codeiomanipcode nor anything else in new.cpp. It sure as heck was to do with some oddities of VS not code itself, but still beats me what exactly was the issue.p

Negative 88865 pIn their latest versions of their apps, Google has implemented a pretty cool way of swiping between tabs versus clicking tab headers. I was wondering if someone has more concrete ideas of how this is done.p  pHere are some thoughts  feel free to critiquep  pMy initial thought is that this isnt a standard codeTabActivitycode which hosts child activities. Infact, I dont even think its a custom codeActivityGroupcode either. The row of tabs scrolls when swiped, but doesnt cause the active tab to switch.p  pSwiping the main content of the tab exhibits interesting behavior. I suspect there is a GestureListener attached to main content area. As tabs are swiped, rows from the adjacent tab become visible. This seems to suggest that this is a horizontally scrollable group of codeListViewcodes. Its almost like a horizontally scrollable HTML div, where all content already exists but comes into view when swiped. Im not really sure how rendering of the rows is handled though traditionally, rows are built and displayed when scrolling a list updown not leftright. So maybe its a custom codeListViewcode implementation too When not scrolling sidetoside, it behaves as you would expect a regular codeListViewcode to, including fastscrolling and glow effect when pulled down.p  pThe row of tabs is probably a codeScrollViewcode, as evidenced by the glow effect when swiped to the edges. The row of the tab contents isnt.p  pIm trying to build a mental model of the different pieces that comprise this really nifty piece of UI. Any insights are much appreciated.p

Im polling every 800 milliseconds and its very laggyglitchy. Sometimes when clicking the button it doesnt register it.

Negative 88865 pIm interested in having clients, on iOSOS X platforms using Cocoa, having secure transaction with a dedicated server.  Im looking for the easiest and most proper use of the fancy highly abstracted APIs that Apple has developed.  An example of what Im talking about with those fancy APIs is that https is implemented for free and could suit my purposes  except that I dont know how to implement the corresponding server portion of thatp  pThe network messages basically need to be a secure session where a client can create an account, or log in with that account, can send a request to the server, and receive a response from the server.  The traffic is low volume, latency is OK, most important thing is to implement confidentiality and to make my software effort as short as possible.p  pThe server will be on FreeBSD and will either run Cocoa via Cocotron or can use some other  technology you mention that would make development faster.  The computation being done on the server is minimal, requires db intfc, etc. p

I get the sense that maybe Python is lazily not requesting the entire contents of the URL until I request it via readlines, and by then the app engine dev server has overzealously closed the connection.  But I could be totally wrong about that.p  pI tried researching this problem but I didnt see anything applicable.  Most of the Google hits Im seeing surround random, intermittant timing issues this isnt an intermittant problem, its reliable or proxyfirewall issues nothing like that going on here.p  pAssuming my theory is correct  is there a way to tell urlopen to get the whole response right away, as wget and the browser seem to be doing  Or is there a way to tell the GAE dev server to chill out and not close the connection so quickly  Id rather not dive into lowerlevel python socket stuff if I dont have to.p  pthanksp  pp.s. clarification the python script is just running from the command line and trying to make a connection to the GAE dev server, which is running on the same box.  Im NOT trying to connect to the GAE dev server from itself or something weird like that, the GAE server is running Java, not Python.  What Im actually trying to do here is this my GAE web app has some web services and Im writing a batch script to getpost to those webservices, so that when I need to resetclear the data store example data gets corrupted I can use this python script to back up the data first, then I erase the data store, and then use the script again to load that data back in.p  pUPDATE so I tried a few more tests.  Python has no trouble reading any HTML file served by the GAE dev server.  However any JSP, even the simplest hello world JSP, fails to read with the same connection reset by peer error.  Ill try updating to the 1.6.1 version of the GAE SDK, I have to do that anyway at some point, might as well be now.  Hopefully it will fix this.p

Negative 88865 pI have an ActiveResource based application referred to as client that interfaces with an API applicationreferred to as api.p  pI have a model instance, I update the instance through a form, form puts to the client with a simple controller like thisp  precodedef update   currentuser.updateattributespsset gt params[permissions] end codepre  pInstead of going to the update controller on the api though, the update controller POSTS to the create controller on the api, not the update, i.e. triggers POST to users instead PUT to usersid. the form always goes to this controller, so the form posts to the client properly.p  pThe most maddening part is that running the command p  precodecurrentuser.updateattributespsset gt params[permissions] codepre  pfrom within pry with the same environment for the same resource will PUT to usersid on the api.p  pSo something in that update controller when calling updateattributes is catching that as trying to register a new resource and goes to create on the api.p  pIm mystified as to why I cant update from a controller, but can from a command line instance. This is a first in this situation, with this controller, so there must be something I am doing at some point that triggers a new resource, but cant figure out what. As usual, Ill attempt to fill in more specific code based on questions.

If there is a better way to make that distinction in routes userusers without separate controllers Id like to now, it is just a persnickety user apprehension feature I noticed.p  pAfter tweaking routes around and whatnot, the issue persist. I post properly to the client route, that client route goes to create a new resource, not update the existing one even though it uses params it would use for updating.p  pUGH, found an answer sort of. I started using the cachedresource gem with this client, and I recently turned it on for all the models. Turned it off for the user model, problem gone.

Negative 88865 pIs the concept of the Fortran ISOCBINDING module also supported by CC compiler vendors For example, the size of a CC codeintcode can vary between the compilers from different vendors. So, with the ISOCBINDING module, we know that a Fortran codeCINTcode type is 4 bytes rather than merely having a emkindem of 4. But, we still dont know the size of an codeintcode in general in CC.

Negative 88865 pIm working up a website that, among other things, connects to Twitter through its OAuth interface.  I have so far been pretty sloppy about dealing with the security of my access tokens and the like, and its time to fix that.  Thus my question  trying to understand whats the Right Thing to do here.  Twitter is a real concern for what Im doing, but Im sure that dealing with Facebook and other similar services, OAuthed or not, would have similar issues.p  pLooking at the site overall, it seems that Im dealing with at least the following things that have security implicationsp  ul liMy databases name, username, and passwordli liThe consumer key and consumer secret for my Twitter applicationli liThe username, access token, and access token secret for the user that the site will use to talk to Twitterli liFor each of the sites users, their Twitter access token and access token secretli ul  pSo  whats the right thing to do with all this stuff  I could offer suggestions about what I think should happen, based on the different kinds of attacks one could imagine, but its probably better if I just plead complete ignorance rather than my more probable 90 ignorance and see if theres anything in the way of consensus or best practices out there.  Ill accept flames for my security newbieism, but techniques for losing my newbie status would be more appreciated.  Thanks very muchp

Negative 88865 pI am working on an android project for personal interest. I am working with multiple EditText fields and all must be filled in to a nonzero decimal or integer.  I have specified in my xml file that it only accepts numbers or decimals.

Right now, it runs fine when all of the fields are filled, but I want to add some kind of exception handling so that if by mistake you forget to enter a field, the application will display an error message instead of crashing.

Negative 88865 pI have a program that uses codeboostsharedptrcodes and, in particular, relies on the accuracy of the codeusecountcode to perform optimizations.p  pFor instance, imagine an addition operation with two argument pointers called lhs and rhs.  Say they both have the type codesharedptrltNodegtcode.  When it comes time to perform the addition, Ill check the codeusecountcode, and if I find that one of the arguments has a reference count of exactly one, then Ill reuse it to perform the operation in place.  If neither argument can be reused, I must allocate a new data buffer and perform the operation outofplace.  Im dealing with enormous data structures, so the inplace optimization is very beneficial.p  pBecause of this, I can never copy the codesharedptrcodes without reason, i.e., every function takes the codesharedptrcodes by reference or const reference to avoid distorting codeusecountcode.p  pMy question is this I sometimes have a codesharedptrltTgt ampcode that I want to cast to codesharedptrltT constgt ampcode, but how can I do it without distorting the use count  codestaticpointercastcode returns a new object rather than a reference.  Id be inclined to think that it would work to just cast the whole codesharedptrcode, as inp  precodevoid fsharedptrltTgt amp x    sharedptrltT constgt amp x  reinterpretcastltsharedptrltT constgt gtampx  codepre  pI highly doubt this complies with the standard, but, as I said, it will probably work.  Is there a way to do this thats guaranteed safe and correctp  pstrongUpdating to Focus the Questionstrongp  pCritiquing the design does not help answer this post.  There are two interesting questions to considerp  ol lipIs there any guarantee by the writer of codeboostsharedptrcode, or by the standard, in the case of codestdtr1sharedptrcode that codesharedptrltTgtcode and codesharedptrltT constgtcode have identical layouts and behaviorpli lipIf 1 is true, then is the above a legal use of reinterpretcast  I think you would be hardpressed to find a compiler that generates failing code for the above example, but that doesnt mean its legal.

So in other words the only way i am able to accomplish my goal so far is to edit all 3 videos into one .m4v file and import that to the project. But that is no good because it doubles my project size.  Id like to call on the existing files to play in one right after another with no break. I hope I didnt sound to repetitious.

So the user can continuously move rows backforth between the two tables using the add and remove buttons.p  pThe add button is when the codesearchResultsTablecode has selected rows and you want to move those to the codeselectedCustomersTablecode.

The move rows between two tables functionality will not work over and over again. It is like it works one time, then it will not work over and over again.p  pHere is my jQuery code  can someone see what the matter is and offer a way to get this to work over and over again Over and over again  meaning  moving rows backforth between two tables forever if the user desired to do so.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function           searchResultsTable.onclick, function e              bindTableEvents                  selectedCustomersTable.onclick, function e              bindTableEvents                   bindTableEvents           function bindTableEvents              var t1  searchResultsTable             var t2  selectedCustomersTable             alertin             setupTablet2             setupTablet1                   function setupTabletable              table.initializeTable                 navigate                      control  keyboard true, mouse true ,                     select  multiple true                                             table.onmouse, function e, event                  if event.which  1 ampamp event.ctrlKey ampamp event.shiftKey                      var selected  table.selected                     if selected.length  1                          selected.hasClassactive                                                                 table.onkeyboard, function e, event                  var selected  table.selected                 switch event.which                      case 13                         ENTER                         if selected.length  1                              selected.hasClassactive                                                  if selected.length gt 0                                                    break                     case 46                         DELETE                         if selected.length gt 0                                                    break                                                 addButton.clickfunction               var selectedRows  searchResultsTable.selected             selectedCustomersTable.appendselectedRows.removeClassfocus.remove           removeButton.clickfunction               var selectedRows  selectedCustomersTable.selected             searchResultsTable.appendselectedRows.removeClassfocus.remove                    ltscriptgt codepre

Once the key is known and the digest is known, is it possible to get the plaintext back preimage attack without bruteforce a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPreimageattack relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPreimageattackap  pMy intuition says NO as the block size input size is 512 bit and the output size is 256 bit.

Negative 88865 pI came across the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff38521028voffice.1229.aspx relnofollowPST file format specificationa released by Microsoft. It seems like quite a few people came up with solutions to read a PST file based on this specification but there seems to be a dearth of writers that can take a bunch of data and wrap it up within the PST format. I was wondering if somebody could enlighten me on why this might be the case and how would somebody go about writing some logic that would take some binary data and store it in a particular format.p  pEdit I realized I have not provided much in the way of context around why I am interested in writing a PST file generator. I need to create PST files that consists of some binary files sitting on a Linux machine. The requirement is that this PST generator needs to be sitting on a Linux box as well. It seems like if I transitioned the PST generation to a windows machine, theres some .NET Interop machinations that can generate the PST file but the core requirement is to generate PSTs in a scalable fashion on a Linux machine. p  pThanksp

Negative 88865 pI would like to use OOPOOD as an exercise for a small project, but I often find myself using a procedural approach when coding. I use Python in combination with Flask web frameworkp  pIn essence my app is a kind of spider that reads an rss feed for new movie releases. For each new movie release it uses the imdb link to gather information from two different web services imdbapi and TMDb regarding plot, year, genre, poster and info like that. If the preferred service cannot provide the information, then use the other service.  Finally save all the info in a db.  I then use Flask to present the information on a websitep  pI have created a Spider class for now. It contains the following methods code removed for clarityp  precodeclass Spider  Spider Class   def initself, rssfeed  def runupdateself     movielist  self.getentriesfromfeed     self.getimdbjsonmovielist  def getentriesfromfeedself      reads an rss feed and return a list of lists with imdb id, title, and added date         time   def getimdbjsonself, movielist      get json data from imdbapi based on list with imdb id     if not in db         savetodb  def savetodbself, key, nzbtitle, added, data      save entry to db from json data codepre  pThe problem is that I use the strongrunupdatestrong method to carry out all the steps in a procedural way. I also find the design inflexible. E.g if I cant get movie information for one service id like to try the other service, but this is not very easy to implement in the current format.p  pWhat I have thought about is to create a Movie class, representing each movie found in the rssfeed. Maybe also to create classes for each of the services I use for gathering information about each movie, imdbapi and TMDbp  pSo, how would you go about and design an app like this in an OOPOOD fashion I find it a little hard to identify classes, when we are beyond the simple examples used in text books  like cars, books, fruits and etc.p

Heres what Ive created Im running ubuntu 12.04p  precode binbash  this attepmts to copy the profile folder for Thunderbird to the backup drive echo ...attempting to copy Thunderbird Profile to backup drive My Passport  attempt to backup two directories to where media folder and therefore My Passport is located parentdirname PWD grandparentdirname parent greatgranddirname grandparent  show what directories the variables are set to echo ...parent parent echo ...grandparent grandparent echo ...greatgrand greatgrand  echo ...copying...

Im guessing I dont need it in the first subscript the last line above but when I tried to just use cd .thunderbirdlOdhn9g... I was still getting the error.  For the second subscript Im not sure exactly what is happening.  Am I just misunderstanding the folder navigation syntaxp  pAlso, this is a side question but is scripting in this manner something a software developer should know how to do or is this kind of thing more reserved for system admins  I havent taken any scripting classes or do I know of any offered through my university however I find it interesting and can see how it could be pretty useful...  Thanksp
Negative 88865 pThis is not a question I believe anyone can really provide a emsolutionem to, but perhaps someone can shed some light. My actual problem was just solved by our network admin by letting me have access to the sql servers in production, but the problen, as I see it, is still there and I cannot understand strongwhystrong.p  pThe problem if you do a schema comparison in vs 2010 between a database project and a .dbschema file you cannot create an update script. p  pSource a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa833435vvs.100.aspxViewDifferences relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa833435vvs.100.aspxViewDifferencesap  pQuote from MSDN If Show Schema Update Script is unavailable, either scripts cannot be generated for the target that you specified or that the comparison needs to be refreshed. For example, if your target schema is a .dbschema file, you cannot create an update script.p  pThe reason I would do this is because I didnt have access to the production servers. This is of course quite common. p  pSo, I created a .dbschema file, compared and I cannot generate an update script. Why is that It just doesnt make ANY sense whatsoever to just remove that functionality.p

Negative 88865 pWorking on a project for class specific to the college network.p  pThe idea is that if we can fetch an identifying characteristic of the web sessionconnection on campus, we can map out and associate the AP with their location coordinates and plot them on a map. More specifically, were trying to determine which AP the device is connected to. p  pBasically the user would bring up a webpage on the intranet from a wifi enabled device preferably an iPad or iPod Touch, and either on the page load or through an action event an unique identifier is captured which we could in turn associate with lat amp long coordinates. The idea here is that the unique identifier would be sent and stored into to a DB field almost like a guestbook submission. Then, externally on a separate public webpage  viewers would be able to see these unique identifiers returned and translated as the most recently visited locations plotted on a map. This would translate to a manual checkin tracking service. p  pCapturing the IP address will not work as they are not static. p

Negative 88865 pFrom code, how do I hide the EditText underbar the prompt line with little serifs at the ends  p  pThere might be a better way to do what I want  I have a layout with an EditText.  Normally, this displays fine where the user can tap on it and begin entering or editing text.p  pSometimes, however, I would like to use the same layout simplifies other logic to display the same data in a readonly manner.  I want the presentation to be similar  it should have the same height and same font, but not have the underbar.p  pAs a stopgap measure, Im going to implement this by removing the EditText and substituting a TextView.  I think that will give the desired results, but it seems like a roundabout an expensive way to do something that ought to be easy to do by changing attributes.p

Its fast this cache lives in memory. When an NDB   function writes to the Datastore, it also writes to the incontext   cache. When an NDB function reads an entity, it checks the incontext   cache first. If the entity is found there, no Datastore interaction   takes place.p      pQueries do not look up values in any cache. However, query results are   written back to the incontext cache if the cache policy says so but   never to Memcache.p blockquote  pHm I am lost here. Everything seems to be ok. Even if query from the console I get the correct sum, but never on the same handler, no matter what function etc. p  pOnly thing I noticed is that when put a wait codetime.sleep1code then I get the correct results. So that has to do with the fact that the codendb.putmulticode might not complete synchronously or not. So confused....p

Negative 88865 pWith the advent of ARC, some new functions were made available to allow developers to play around with weakly referenced objects. codeid objcloadWeakid locationcode is one of them. This function receives one parameter correspoding to a location in memory where a weak object was stored and returns this object if it is still alive or codenilcode if it were deallocated.p  pIt seems that when an object codeobjcode is stored as codeweakcode in a location codelocationcode with codeid objcstoreWeakid location, id objcode, codeobjcode is put in a weak map, with codelocationcode as a key. However, in order to retrieve codeobjcode, codeobjcloadWeakcode can not only use codelocationcode as a key and return the value, which corresponds to codeobjcode. It must also check whether codeobjcode is still alive to return codenilcode if it is not anymore.p  pHowever, codeobjcloadWeakcode can not try to read the objects retain count, because the object may have been deallocated. Moreover, although the weak map, codeobjcstoreWeakcode, codeobjcloadWeakcode and the codeNSObjectcode class are implemented in the same file a hrefhttpopensource.apple.comsourceobjc4objc4532.2runtimeNSObject.mm relnofollowNSObject.mma, codeNSObjectcodes codedealloccode method doesnt signals to the weak map that the object that is being deallocated is going away.p  pSo, how does the ObjectiveC runtime figure out whether a codeweakcode object is still alivep

But they all inherit from a BasePoster class. p  pAll in all I am going to have about 100 different types of posters. A concrete PinBoard instance can easily contain 1000 posters and more of all different kinds of posters in diverse order. p  pIn order to populate the posters of a certain PinBoard, I need to feed the PinBoard with a list of certain poster generators the amount and type of generators will change based on the context. There will be one poster generator per poster type e.g. the PetPosterGenerator which generates a collection of pet posters.p  pI thought it would be nice if all my poster generators could share the same type safe interface. Thats why I introduced the IPosterGenerator interface.p  pstrongMy problem is that the code does not compilestrong. There are two compiler errors with the same error message emUsing the generic type myApp.IPosterGenerator requires 1 type argumentsemp  pI am not surprised by the error message because I am not defining any type at these locations. It would be great if I could do something like this in the line of the first errorp  precodeprotected ListltIPosterGeneratorltTgtgt PosterGenerators  get set  codepre  pBut when I do this, the compiler cant find type or namespace T.p  pNow I am kind of lost. Maybe using the generic IPosterGenerator interface is not such a good idea after all. But I am sure that at some point in my application I need to know or access the concrete poster type which a certain IPosterGenerator represents. p  pHow would you guys approach this Thank you very much for your support in advance. p

Negative 88865 pDoes anyone know of a better way to verify string format in C without using the C11 regex class. Basically I have several strings in this type of format TAG1VALUE, TAG2VALUE, TAG1VALUE, TAG2VALUEp  pTAG1 and TAG2 are strings and VALUE is an integer value of various lengthp  pAn example string would be PPS112, FJ543, PPS76432, FJ753 and so on. p  pI need a function that would verify that the format is exactly correct.p  pSo far I am doing it with character by character verification. This seems tedious at best. Is there a better way that I am simply not aware of. Again I would like to avoid using regex from C11 or any third party libraries unless I have to. I was mostly wondering if there is a better way to do this with just C and STLp

Negative 88865 pIm working on a node.js based frameworkserver. This framework starts an express server and automatically loads all plugins from a local directory. The framework and individual plugins each have their own git repository.p  pThe framework is here a hrefhttpsgithub.comAppsecuteappsecuteconnectormulti relnofollowhttpsgithub.comAppsecuteappsecuteconnectormultia see server.js for plugin loading.  p  pAn example plugin is here a hrefhttpsgithub.comAppsecuteappsecuteconnectormultiheroku relnofollowhttpsgithub.comAppsecuteappsecuteconnectormultiherokua see connector.js for the plugin definitionbootstrap file.  p  pThis all works fine locally. Now its time to get it deployed to Heroku. My plan was to write a small script that cloned the framework  specified plugins and built a folder structure that was ready to be deployed.p  pI have written this script here a hrefhttpsgithub.comAppsecuteappsecuteconnectormultideployment relnofollowhttpsgithub.comAppsecuteappsecuteconnectormultideploymentap  pNow, on to my question, is it possible to instruct Heroku to do an npm install in both the root of the application the framework, as well as specific subdirectories each of the pluginsp  pI know node will look inside the nearest nodemodules folder relative to the script that is loading the modules, so if a plugin tries to load a module then node will first look in approotpluginspluginnamenodemodules  which is exactly what I want, I just need Heroku to make sure the modules are there.p  pI was initially planning on letting my build script go to the various directories and run an npm install, but then I remembered Heroku will do its own npm install. p  pMy other option is to write some code that inspects all the dependencies in each plugins package.json file, then do a union on all the dependencies and write them out in to the package.json in to the root of the app. This way when Heroku does its npm install then all dependencies will be installed. This sounds brittle and will probably fail when different plugins specify a different version of the same module.p  pAnd all this finally begs the question, am I just doing this wrong Should I be looking at a different architecturerepo structure etc.p

Negative 88865 p1 I can see very clearly that the number of floating point operations a computer can do in one second is a good way of quantifying its performance. Thats correct, rightp  p2 My teacher keeps asking me to calculate the flop rate for algorithms I program. I do this by calculating how many flops the algorithm does and timing how long it takes to run. In this situation the flop rate always falls way short of the flop rate I expect from the computer Im using. So for algorithms, is a flop rate more an assessment of how long the other stuff takes i.e. overheads, stuff that doesnt involve flopping. That is, when the flop count is low, most of the programs time is spent calling functions etc. and not performing flop, correctp  pI know this is a very broad question but I was hoping for some ideas from those in industry or academia about what they intuitively feel the flop rate of an algorithm actually is.p

Negative 88865 pSince the latest Java update, two of my applets are displaying a warning popup to our users even though both of the codejarcode files we are using are signed.

Is there a higher level of signing I need to dop  pEdit This is occurring as of the latest Java update. See the quote below taken from a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkjavajavasetechjavacodesigning1915323.htmlthis pagea.p  blockquote   pAuthors and vendors of applications deployed using either Java applets or Java Web Start technology  applications distributed to end users at runtime via the web browser or network  should sign their code using a trusted certificate for the best user experience. Specifically, all Java code executed within the clients browser will prompt the user. The type of dialog messages presented depends upon risk factors like, code signed or unsigned, code requesting elevate privileges, JRE is above or below the security baseline, etc. Low risk scenarios present a very minimal dialog and include a checkbox to not display similar dialogs by the same vendor in the future. Higher risk scenarios, such as running unsigned jars, will require more user interaction given the increased risk.p blockquote

Negative 88865 pI have been working on a problem for a few hours and I feel like Im running in circles.p  pI am writing a script that will check the a table from and old database to a new one and it wants too see if there are differences in the tables. I have this part done but want to make the output easier to read. I ideally want an output to happen when there are records in the table, signifying there are differences. So if there are differences in tables 1, 4 , and 8 the output will say table 1, table 4, table 8.

Negative 88865 pOn my form, I have a DataGridView with some DataGridViewComboBoxColumns, and some ComboBoxes. The DataGridView is bound to a BindingSource, and each of the ComboBoxes SelectedItem property are bound to corresponding columns in the DataGridView. The pairs of  DataGridViewComboBoxColumns and ComboBoxes have the same DataSource for Items.p  pThe expected behaviour is that when I change rows in the grid, the ComboBoxes should reflect the value of the corresponding column and newly selected row. What happens is that the ComboBoxes change according to the previously selected row i.e. one step behind, causing the newly selected rows DataGridViewComboBoxColumns to be a clone of the last ones. p  pI have the same functionality working on other such pairs, the difference being that their DataSource is bound to a database, and the SelectedValue property is used instead.p

Negative 88865 pIm working on a project for a client. Its an iPad pdf reader. The client wants a collection view, but instead of scrolling vertically, he wants it to use a page control.  Its pretty hard to explain, but what I basically want is all the PDFs on the device in a grid, like on the iBooks app. When that grid overflows, I want to use a page control to display the extra elements on a second page like in the weather app.p  pMy thoughts on this were  Create a page control with one page.   On that page, create a UICollectionView.  If the number of elements is greater than 9 add a page to the page control and add another UICollectionView, until there are enough pages to display all elements.p  pHowever, this seems horribly inefficient, so my question is if theres a better way to do this.p

Negative 88865 pIm now investigating a memory leak in a legacy BB7 app, originally developed for OS 4.5 by devs that are no longer in the company. The hole is so big the device degrades with time and puts the device in a sluggish state in a few hours of use. It gets slower because the dreaded black clock appears in screen with an increasing frequency for simple operations. Ive confirmed with the debugger that the black clock appears when the Garbage Collector fires in, and no other heavy processing is taking place during these intervals. Apparently these automatic GC operations do not aleviate the memory shortage.p  pIve inspected the process app memory using the BlackBerry Objects View in BB plugin for eclipse. Ive not seen an abnormal number of instances of any kind inside this process. Interestingly, a great number of instances of a class from the model appear to live in the root process RAM pid0 despite being created by this app process. And they appear to be leaked due to iterations over the persistent vector that holds them for example there are only 100 instances in persistent store, but after a few iterations over the persistent vector, there are 2000 instances in the root process RAM. Clearly the 1900 extra instances are clones of the ones already in persistence. With the debugger on, I can see that the instances keep piling in RAM and are not collected by the brief automatic GC that I can see in the console, but they are removed when I manually force the GC from the debugger which takes considerably longer to run.p  pThe main suspect is a DAO class that is kept in the codeRuntimeStorecode as a singleton instance must be called from alternate entry points too. It holds a reference to a codeBigVectorcode that is saved in the codePersistentStorecode, and contains instances of the model class above mentioned. This is a shortened versionp  precode    public class LeakyDAO           private long persistentStoreId         private long runtimeStoreId         private PersistentObject persistentObject         private BigVector bigVector          private LeakyDAOlong idp, long idr              persistentStoreId  idp             runtimeStoreId  idr             persistentObject  PersistentStore.getPersistentObjectpersistentStoreId             Object o  persistentObject.getContents                    ifo instanceof BigVector                 bigVector  BigVector o              else                  bigVector  new BigVector                 persistentObject.setContentsbigVector                                       public static synchronized LeakyDAO getInstancelong idPersist, long idRuntime              RuntimeStore rs  RuntimeStore.getRuntimeStore             LeakyDAO dao  LeakyDAO rs.getidRuntime             if dao  null                  dao  new LeakyDAOidPersist, idRuntime                 try                      rs.putidRuntime, dao                  catch IllegalArgumentException e                      Already exists                                           return dao                   public synchronized Object getint index              return ObjectGroup.expandGroupbigVector.elementAtindex                    public synchronized void insertAtint index, Persistable p                     ObjectGroup.createGroupIgnoreTooBigp             if index gt bigVector.size                  bigVector.addElementp              else                  bigVector.insertElementAtp, index                          persistentObject.setContentsbigVector             persistentObject.commit                  codepre  pIs there anything horribly wrong about this class Im overlooking At this point I cant yet confirm these instances are actually the cause of the problem because the app behaves quite diferently when plugged to the debugger. But could it be possible that, due to a bug in the OS or known behaviour some instances are being leaked after calling repeatedly codegetcode or codeinsertAtcodep  hr  pUPDATEbr The problems with automatic garbage collection and some OutOfMemoryErrors are only observed when the debugger is on. When it is not in debug mode, the automatic GC does work as expected, so I think theres a problem with the debugger. Ive also had a few resets when in the objects view.p

It moves the sliderbutton and the dialog away and I dont see anything.p  pI used the following codep  precodeifsliderbutton.cssmarginright  400px      sliderDialog.animatemarginright 400     sliderbutton.animatemarginright 400  else     sliderDialog.animatemarginright 400     sliderbutton.animatemarginright 400  codepre  pI thought, it as simple as finding if the previously selected dialog is different than current than just call the same code that hides the dialog when user clicks on the same node again. ie. p  precodesliderDialog.animatemarginright 400 sliderbutton.animatemarginright 400 codepre  pBut, it behaves weird.

Negative 88865 pIn my codeASP.Net MVCcode project, I have used codewindow.printcode to allow user printing the current page. However, when I tested it on codeWindows XPcode and codeIE 8code combination, I found that the actual print is showing all radio buttons reset to original default selection.p  pe.g. If there is a group of 3 radio buttons say Monthly, Quarterly and Yearly with Monthly selected by default, then even if I select Yearly before printing the page, the actual printout shows Monthly as selected. But on a web page this selection remains as Yearly.p  pI also tested it using codeIE 9code with mode set as IE 8 where it is not reproduced. What could be the reason of this internal resetting of radio buttons on printout Is this related to browser compatibilityp  pHere is my HTML for one such group of buttons in my pagep  precodeltdivgt      ltinput typeradio idfreqmonth namerepayments checkedchecked valueMonthly gt      ltlabel forfreqmonthgtMonthlyltlabelgt       ltinput typeradio idfreqfortnight namerepayments valueFortnightly gt                  ltlabel forfreqfortnightgtFortnightlyltlabelgt       ltinput typeradio idfreqweek namerepayments valueWeekly gt      ltlabel forfreqweekgtWeeklyltlabelgt ltdivgt codepre

Negative 88865 pI have a VS2010 solution tried mimicking my main issue which has 2 project and each project has one windows form each. strongMainformstrong is in project1 which has reference to project 2 where strongChildFormstrong is defined.p  pI have a button on MainForm whose button click event creates a strongChildFormstrong and shows. While ChildForm is shown, i can invoke any menu commands each menu command is implemented to show a message box which are defined on strongMainFormstrong without any issues.p  pBUT, on other hand, I kept all the code as is and override OnPaint method of ChildForm with this.Invalidate as shown belowp  precodeprotected override void OnPaintPaintEventArgs e              this.Invalidate         base.OnPainte      codepre  pI ran executable and it opened up my MainForm and clicked on button to open up my ChildForm, then clicked on one of the Menu command to raise a message box, then I found that both MainForm and ChildForms are frozen and are hanged without any response.p  pCan anyone put some light on what went wrong with overriding OnPaint method which executes this.Invalidate line everytime and suggest how can I resolve this issue.p  pRegards, Kumarp

Negative 88865 pIs it too much to render 900 triangles in papervision   I know the CPU model also affects, Im using a core2duo 1.7GhZ. But rendering 900 triangles, as 5 cylinders seems too much, and drops the performance when rotating them for examples each frame... The FPS at normal is 30FPS, but it drops when rotating or spinning the cylinders to 14FPS. Im really surprised about that performance, as Quake or Doom they were purely software rendering engines, and they had much more polygons than my application and they had a better performance of course.p

The animations are really simplep  precode[UIView animateWithDurationanimationDuration delayanimationDelay optionsUIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut animations     self.frame  nextFrame     ...  completionBOOL finished      ... ] codepre  pTo fix the jerky animation, I set the codealphacode before the animationp  precodeself.alpha  0.99 codepre  pSome interesting points p  ol liSetting the codealphacode inside of the animation works as wellli liSetting the codealphacode back to code1.0code after the animation and then doing the reverse animation with a 1.0 alpha does not give a smooth reverse animation.li ol  h2Opacity fixh2  pI have previously used the opacity fix to make animations smooth when scaling and panning multiple images. For example, I had two large images panning and scaling at different speeds with one on top of the other. When a previously unrendered part of the lower image the image on the bottom became visible, the animation would become jerky panning as well as scaling. My thought for why codealphacode helps in this case is, if the top image has a bit of transparency, the bottom image must always be rendered, which means it can be cached before the animation takes place. This thought is backed by doing the reverse animation and not seeing the jerky animation. I guess I would be interested to know if anyone has different thoughts on this as well.p  pHaving said the above, I dont know how this would have an affect when there is just one image as in the situation I am describing in my question. Particularly when after getting the jerky animation, the reverse animation is still jerky. Another point of difference between the two situations is that it is only scaling that causes the problem in the current issue, while in the double image issue it was panning strongas well asstrong scaling.p  hr  pI hope the above is clear  any insights appreciated.p

Negative 88865 pI have a small program that implements three sorting algorithms and runs a timeanalysis using the C time library and calling codeclockcode of the execution time for each. The program reads in 9999, 19999, and 29999 integers before sorting the arrays. Upon completion, the median of the newly sorted data is found as a testament to the proper sorting of the data. p  pThe problem was that on my personal Windows 7 machine I could not find the median of data sorted via the quicksort algorithm despite having a properly sorted set. However, when ran on the Linux machine all works fine embutem the timing runs awry from what is expected.p  pThe quicksort algorithm is codenlogncode average case. So, we would expect the time of execution to increase with larger data sets which is does on my personal machine. However, when ran on the linux machine I get a 0 execution time for the smallest set of data and equivalent time for the following two.p  pI could understand the 0 resultant of the calculations associated with the time taken for execution due to truncation of integer arithmetic, but my personal machine runs much quicker on every other algorithm. The lagging noted for this particular instance has driven me to inquire about the differences. p  pIf you think that the reason behind the discrepancy might be do to the implementation of how I went about readingsorting then comment as such. However, I am more interested in the differences between how the system time is handled between the two systems and various other things that may be the culprit. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQFGsp.jpg altenter image description herep  pAnd also, sometimes when the program was run on the linux machine the output execution time would actually be something like code10 0 10code, so naturally it has me interested. p

Negative 88865 pI have a table cell X which contains some tablesdivs inside it. I am trying to add a functionality to it which adds an arrow on the side of the cell when I hover over it. The problem is that it is resizing the cell when I hover over it and then adding my required arrow.  For the arrow I am using jQuery to create a div which contains a table with rows for an overlay a stroke and the arrow icon. I am appending that div to the my original cell using jQuery.  I am setting a property with jQuery that when I hover over the original cell, that div should show. I used the jQuery method .show to achieve that. This is adding a displayblock in the css and causing the cell to increase in size vertically. I have tried positionabsolute but it does not work since the original table which contains cell X can have many rows and each row will have a cell X in them and all cells will need similar arrows on the end when hovered over. p  pThe jQuery code that I have used isp  precode    this.hover  document.createElementdiv     this.hover.propid, hover     this.hover.addClasspersonrowhover     var html  ltdiv classpersonrowhoverstrokegtltdivgt     html  lttable classpersonrowhovertablegt     html  lttrgt     html  lttd classpersonrowhovertablegt     html  ltdiv classarrowrightgreygtltdivgt     html  lttdgt     html  lttrgt     html  lttablegt     this.hover.appendhtml     this.stroke  this.hover.children[0]     this.stroke.hide     this.arrow  this.hover.children[1].rows[0].cells[0].children     var arrow  this.arrow     cell.appendthis.hover     this.hover.hide     var hover  this       row.mouseoverfunction          hover.displayArrow                       Displays the hover arrow.     param none           this.displayArrow  function         this.hover.show     codepre  pThe CSS used for this code isp  precode.personrowhover verticalalignmiddle textaligncenter positionrelative    right300px top55px width27px height20px cursorpointer .personrowhoveroverlay backgroundcolorBCBDC0 .personrowhoveroverlayclickedbackgroundcolorCFD1D7 .personrowhoverstroke positionabsolute left2px width1px height100 border    left1px solid white .personrowhovertable positionabsolute verticalalignmiddle border0px    height100 width100 zindex5 codepre  pTHE HTML FOR THE CELL IS a hrefhttppastebin.comVwE4x25s relnofollowhttppastebin.comVwE4x25sap  pTHE IMAGE ON HOW IT LOOKS ISp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comycRbJ.png altThe Cell Xp  pI have color coded it, The div that I append is in color black.

If I used the original values the RelativeLayout would take up all the screen. Could anyone explain to me why that is I also tried googling the issue and noticed people would suggest to set layoutheight to 0dip which I tried but it also didnt work as expected.p  pSecondly, I tried adding the already mentioned ImageView to the bottom RelativeLayout. This, however, basically displays only the ImageView and not the buttons  or one of the buttons is on top of the image hiding it. Why is that Dont I specifically set the buttons to be placed below it img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6X8H1.png altenter image description herep  pWhat should the code look like in order for it to be doing what I expect itp  pFurther explanationp  pBelow are images that should help indicate what exactly I want to achieve. The green bits are the ScrollViews  I added them because Android devices tend to have diverse screen sizes. Their purpose is to present the content properly independently of the screen size, i.e. if the screen is small, the user will be able to scroll that part to read the entire text and view the image. The red bit on the left Intro shows the ImageView that is supposed to always be at the bottom of the screen itll always be there, visible, and its the green bit above it that will be movable. If you take a look at the red bit on the right Instructions, theres a Next button thats covering the image with the lorrytruck that was visible in the Intro screenshot. Now thats wrong  there should be 2 buttons BELOW the image, as seen on the last screenshot the 2 blue rectangles.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com14bQF.png altenter image description hereimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comY1I0V.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKWIVY.png altenter image description herep

Negative 88865 pIn the process of a responsive redesign of a website. For the mobile smartphone view, Im looking to duplicate the menu that appears in the latest Google Plus iOS app. It consists essentially of a bar w 3 icons at the top. If you tab the left icon, the left menu slides out. If you tap the middle icon, a full screen menu drops down to let you choose various options. If you tap the right icon, the right menu slides out. Moreover, you can pull the left and right menus out from the side w a slide motion on the screen.p  pHeres the normal look of the app which shows the menu bar at the top some details are blurred out.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDBv1H.png altenter image description herep  pHeres the left menu pulled out.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZQsEm.png altenter image description herep  pHeres the middle full screen menu drop down.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhsG7O.png altenter image description herep  pHeres the right menu pulled out from the right.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLc4V4.png altenter image description herep  pWhats the best way to duplicate this type of menu design This will be a responsive design so obviously when viewing on desktop, it will have a different look and behavior.p
Negative 88865 pIm trying to make a 6 color cube 1 color per face that rotates around any axle. The rotation is not an issue but what I figured out is that the face that is drawn at last is the one that get rendered.p  pFor example The front face is red and the back one is green. When the cube starts to rotate, as I called glDrawArrays that creates the red face before the glDrawArrays that creates the green face, whenever the faces get one above the other due the rotation I always see the green face, when I actually should see red, green, red, green etc.p  pHow can I solve this issue I tried to find information in the last days but didnt find the solution.p  pThe code is below.p  precodepublic class MainActivity extends Activity   GLSurfaceView myGLSurfaceView  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      myGLSurfaceView  new GLSurfaceViewthis           myGLSurfaceView.setEGLContextClientVersion2     myGLSurfaceView.setRenderernew RendererClassthis      setContentViewmyGLSurfaceView      runnable.run     Test 2  static float variable2  0  Handler myHandler  new Handler  Runnable runnable  new Runnable       Override     public void run           myHandler.postDelayedrunnable, 20         variable2  1           codepre  pandp  precodepublic class RendererClass implements Renderer   int shaderProgram  int variableToSayWhereTheVertexShaderShouldFindInformation int variableToSayWhereTheFragmentShaderShouldFindInformation int variableToSayWhereTheMatrixShouldFindInformation  int BYTESPERFLOAT  4 FloatBuffer vertexData  float[] aResult  new float[16]  public RendererClassContext context      float[] myVertices                 Front face              0.0f,  0.0f,  1.0f,              0.5f, 0.5f,  1.0f,               0.5f, 0.5f,  1.0f,               0.5f,  0.5f,  1.0f,              0.5f,  0.5f,  1.0f,              0.5f, 0.5f,  1.0f,               Back face              0.0f,  0.0f, 2.0f,              0.5f, 0.5f, 2.0f,               0.5f, 0.5f, 2.0f,               0.5f,  0.5f, 2.0f,              0.5f,  0.5f, 2.0f,              0.5f, 0.5f, 2.0f           ByteBuffer intermediateBuffer  ByteBuffer.allocateDirectmyVertices.lengthBYTESPERFLOAT     intermediateBuffer.orderByteOrder.nativeOrder      vertexData  intermediateBuffer.asFloatBuffer     vertexData.putmyVertices    Override public void onSurfaceCreatedGL10 arg0, EGLConfig config       GLES20.glClearColor0.0f, 0.5f, 1.0f, 1.0f       String vertexShaderCode    attribute vec4 myVertexPositionInsideOpenGL                                uniform mat4 aResult                                 void main                                     glPosition  aResultmyVertexPositionInsideOpenGL                                                                    String fragmentShaderCode  precision mediump float                                 uniform vec4 myColorsInsideOpenGL                                  void main                                     glFragColor  myColorsInsideOpenGL                                      int vertexShaderID  GLES20.glCreateShaderGLES20.GLVERTEXSHADER     int fragmentShaderID  GLES20.glCreateShaderGLES20.GLFRAGMENTSHADER      GLES20.glShaderSourcevertexShaderID, vertexShaderCode     GLES20.glShaderSourcefragmentShaderID, fragmentShaderCode      GLES20.glCompileShadervertexShaderID     GLES20.glCompileShaderfragmentShaderID      shaderProgram  GLES20.glCreateProgram      GLES20.glAttachShadershaderProgram, vertexShaderID     GLES20.glAttachShadershaderProgram, fragmentShaderID      GLES20.glLinkProgramshaderProgram         GLES20.glUseProgramshaderProgram       variableToSayWhereTheVertexShaderShouldFindInformation  GLES20.glGetAttribLocationshaderProgram, myVertexPositionInsideOpenGL     variableToSayWhereTheFragmentShaderShouldFindInformation  GLES20.glGetUniformLocationshaderProgram, myColorsInsideOpenGL     variableToSayWhereTheMatrixShouldFindInformation  GLES20.glGetUniformLocationshaderProgram, aResult      GLES20.glEnableVertexAttribArrayvariableToSayWhereTheVertexShaderShouldFindInformation      vertexData.position0     GLES20.glVertexAttribPointervariableToSayWhereTheVertexShaderShouldFindInformation, 3, GLFLOAT, false, 0, vertexData    Override public void onSurfaceChangedGL10 arg0, int width, int height       Matrix.orthoMaResult, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4     Matrix.rotateMaResult, 0, MainActivity.variable2, 1, 0, 0    GL10 a  Override public void onDrawFrameGL10 glUnused       onSurfaceChangeda, 1, 1      GLES20.glClearGLES20.GLCOLORBUFFERBIT           GLES20.glUniformMatrix4fvvariableToSayWhereTheMatrixShouldFindInformation, 1, false, aResult, 0      glUniform4fvariableToSayWhereTheFragmentShaderShouldFindInformation, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f     glDrawArraysGLTRIANGLEFAN, 0, 6      glUniform4fvariableToSayWhereTheFragmentShaderShouldFindInformation, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f     glDrawArraysGLTRIANGLEFAN, 6, 6      codepre

Negative 88865 pI have a service class that is being used in an ASP.Net MVC 5 web application and in a console application also. Lets call it MyService. When a MyService object is being instantiated by Ninject to be passed to a controller in a web context, I would like a URL to be resolved using something like thisp  precodeurl  Request.Url.GetLeftPartUriPartial.Authority  Url.RouteUrlDefaultApi, new  httproute  , controller  Emailer  codepre  pWhen MyService is being instantiated by my console app using Ninject also, but in a nonweb context, I would like it to take the url from AppSettings like thisp  precodeurl  ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[EmailerUrl] codepre  pIs this feasible I think it might be using WithConstructorArgument with the proper arguments in NinjectWebCommon.RegisterServicesIKernel kernel when creating the binding, but I dont know how exactly.p  pMy guess is that the MyService constructor would have to know about the controller class in which it is being injected and be able to call methods from that controller. If no controller class is known, then it would use the app settings.p  pOf course, I could also set the url parameter within each controller constructor being passed a MyService object, and elsewhere in the console app, but I would prefer not to worry about setting this attribute every time a MyService object is instantiated.p

Negative 88865 pIm just approaching Android Services, but i have many doubts. Here there are some questions. Before starting, notice i have read those pages a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidecomponentsservices.htmlAndroid Services officiala a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidecomponentsboundservices.htmlBounded Services officiala plus sone Inner classes theory in my language. Please be patient, im still a bit confused.p  p1 First of all, a Services differentiates itself from an AsyncTask mainly because it continues to run also if the app is paused i.e. the user is watching another app AsyncTask is stopped in that cases. Is it ok or am i wrong 2 A Service runs in the same thread of the activity that started it through startService. To not affect the Activitys performances, i have to create a separate thread for that Service, for example implementing the Runnable interface. Another method is making a service that extends IntentService, which automatically provides a new thread for the service a new thread is created on any onHandleIntent call.p  pNow, lets look at my concrete problem. I need to create a Service that will be used by many Activities his task will be to connect to the server DB every 60 seconds and check for news. If a news is found, notify theres a new news if we are on MainActivity or show the new newss title if we are in the news reader. How should i code it I have made a MainActivity that instantiate a NewsService and immediately calls startService. On the other side, i have the NewsService extends IntentService, that creates a new thread when onHandleIntent is called and looks for new news. Is it a bad idea to use a IntentService I realized it will be very ugly to start the service calling startService indefinitely. At the start of this exercize i tought it was a good solution because it automatically creates a new thread and makes Service implementation simple. But now i have some doubts i cant know if theres a news How can MainActivity know it And how to get the titlep  pThis should be done with a normal extends Thread class, that makes an infinite cicle in its run method, checking for news every 60 seconds and, if theres a new one, reads the title from remote DB AND update activities buttonsviews. Then if the App will be closed by user, the Service will be closed too. But the problem is that if i istantiate such class its work will be stopped when the MainActivity is paused or stopped, and other Activities the NewsReader in this case cannot get any update because the new thread isnt getting news at the moment. So i need a Service.p  pI hope its clear. How should i implement a solution in the right way Please highlight everything wrong in my text, i really need to learn Dp

Negative 88865 pin a legacy project I find a strange solution for logging. All classes in the servicelayer does have method signature to getting a log.

When I select a row, it will be stored in the userdefault, because when I continue and go back it should stay selected. This works fine, but when I deselect the row, it should be removed from the UserDefaults. How can I do thatp  pI store the selected rows in this wayp  precode [selectedRow insertObject[NSNumber numberWithIntindexPath.row] atIndexarrayIndex]  [userDefaults setObjectselectedRow forKeysightselectedRow] codepre  pThe arrayIndex variable increments everytime when I select a row.

Negative 88865 pI have added some logic for authentication in my angular app and the initial the call to the service wrapping the webapi is executed in the app.run function, like this  p  precodemyApp.runfunction rootScope, location, myService   myService.getCurrentUser.thenfunction promise      reroute to either access denied or the start page when access is verified.     register listener to watch route changes rootScope.onrouteChangeStart, function event, next, current       check access    codepre  pAfter this all my unit tests broke, since I dont know how to inject the mocked version of myService before creating the app module. Ive factored out the service and the mocked service in a seperate module so I can create it before creating the actual app. Like thisp  precode   angular.mock.moduleServiceModule      angular.mock.moduleEArkivApp, function provide, myMockedService          provide.valuemyService, myMockedService      codepre  pThis is not working however, it complains that myMockedService which is part of the ServiceModule is an unkown provider.

Negative 88865 pIm in trouble with a C homework. Programs goal is to get some numbers from a text file about some buildings and by using those numbers calculating the outline of the city as corner points written in a text file, in first text file numbers are written by three tabseberated part, first number is start coordinate, second number is height of the building and third number is width of the building. For instance 24 7 6 means that corners of the building are 24,0, 24,7, 30,7, 30,0.

At first I thought it might be because there was a fill of some sort and they were simply hiding on top of each other, but I set the codefillopacitycode to 0 and that didnt help either.p  pHere is a small sample of the GeoJSON file.p  precode     type FeatureCollection,     features [                      type Feature,             geometry                  type Polygon,                 coordinates [                     [                         [                             122.349453,                             47.717771                         ],                         [                             122.34948,                             47.719585                         ],                         [                             122.349504,                             47.721403                         ],                         [                             122.350214,                             47.721404                         ],                         ...

Negative 88865 peveryone. I am a beginner in network programming. Currently, I want to do an experiment which sends a file2M bytes from Android phone to Ubuntu server. How can I send it at the highest speed I have tried something like using Bufferedreader in Java, reading each byte out of the file and sending that single byte to server through socket outputstream write function. This way seems to cost too much time. I notice that if in the same network condition, I send same file using some Immediate Messenger tools,like Skypeit is much quicker than I did. Does anybody know the API or implementation protocol beneath those Immediate Messenger softwarep  pI probably need to call other efficient APIs other than socket I am also trying to read the whole file into a byte array and then call socket write function to send the huge byte array to server for a just single time.Although when I receive it at server side to found that there are a lot of padding zeros distributed in my original data, the whole transfer seems to cost less time than the single byte transfer method. Anybody has any advice on thisThanks a lotp

Anybody knows what may be the reason for that p  pSomebody mentioned to check sessionid. There interesting things are happening also.

However, the time has come to adapt it to 3.5 screens as well. p  pI tried using codeautolayoutcode and setting constraints in the storyboard, but this didnt work out too well.

This way one view fills up the screen at a time, and the user can scroll to the next view which locks into position. The UIScrollViews size should be the size of the screen, however, the contentsize height should be the height of the three views put together. p  pHow can I achieve this Id prefer using a solution with storyboards, as Im used to laying out the app there. p  pAny help would be appreciatedp  pThanks in advancep  pstrongImagesstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIEO6k.png altLayout img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoqyP2.png altStoryboardp

The threads need to communicate with each other regularly.  p  pI had originally gone about doing this in a horrible way that everyone here would yell at me for.  I saved instances of the thread in each thread and called methods of the class from the other threads if a thread needed that functionality.

When using the debug perspective, I step through the main thread but all I get is the function p  precodeboolean hasMessagesHandler h, int what, Object object  ...  codepre  pfrom the MessageQueue.  The other threads are looping in their run function which doesnt do anything exciting.  None of my logs are printing.

What this entire page does, when I select a number in my list it hides the extra lines I dont need.p  pIn part three, where I added codevar x  periodcode, if I type codedocument.writeperiodcode it gives me the value I want. I just cant get that value anywhere else but that specific location. Basically, I need the codereportthis.valuecode value in my codedocument.writecode in part 2.p  pWhat I think is happening is codereportthis.valuecode doesnt report until a number is selected in my list so the HTML is written before I can use it. Not sure though.p  pI would really appreciate it if someone can help me with this. Thanks. p  pAlso, Is there a better way to select a number in a list that I can use the variable anywhere.

Negative 88865 pThe root issue is that we have an ASP.Net application with a deep folder structure that we run within the Cassini web server and install on customer machines using a ClickOnce deployment. However, ClickOnce imposes limits on file path lengths which is starting to cause our deployment to fail. There are also a bunch of other issues with ClickOnce e.g. handling of binaries in the webapps bin folder which we have solved via creative means i.e. hacky, as such we think a nice way to side step these ClickOnce issues is to deploy the ASP.NET app as a single zip archive. To Do that Cassini and ASP.NET would need to be able to the ZIP archive as a virtual file system.p  pOne method might be to mount the zip archive in the file system e.g. mapped to a new drive letter The concern there is that some customer environments will likely prevent the application from mounting a new drive.p  pIdeally then were looking for some means of representing a zip as a file system that we can point Cassini and ASP.NET to, but that isnt being done by the OS.p  p Update p  pPossible optionsp  ul liUnzip to a temp folder and point to that folder.li liMSDN article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa479502.aspx relnofollowVirtualizing Access to Content Serving Your Web Site from a ZIP Fileali ul

Negative 88865 pI currently have two nodes in use, one of which is a boat polygon and the other a straight vertical rectangle. The boat needs to be a polygon so that it can be hit via projectiles, however this causes me problems when it collides with the vertical rectangle due to the many sides its coming into contact with. Hence a piece of code I want ran only once is instead ran multiple times.p  pIs there anyway to make the collision detection only function for the first contact so that it doesnt repeatedly call p  pIm aware of setting the categoryBitMask to 0 however doing so renders the boat unable to be hit by anything else something I dont want. Additionally I considered using a boolean variable to only run the code once whilst the boat is passing through, however as previously mentioned, due to the different sides, the code think its passed through when in fact its just hitting another side of the boat.p  pI dont have much code to show here other than setting physics bodies so I dont think its necessary, but inside didBeginContact Im using a categoryBitMask comparison to check for collisions.p  pI may have not explained this very well, in which case I apologize, my English is not the best p  pIf anyone can help, itd be much appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 88865 pGot a question re submitting forms using ajax. I am trying to submit a contact form using jqueryajax. I got some code online and would like to tailor it to my needs. It seems that the url parameter for the ajax function is not working properly. When I enter the full url for the php code, ajax throws and error, but when I enter a fake url, the ajax code executes without, obviously, sending any information. So, let me show the form I have and the ajax code. I also have a php file, where the actual processing is done. The php file right now does nothing other than return true. Please, take a look at the ajax code and see if you find anything obvious. Thx a lot.p  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt    lt Contacts gt   ltdiv idcontactsgt     ltdiv classrowgt        lt Alignment gt       ltdiv classcolsmoffset3 colsm6gt            ltpgtampnbspltpgt           ltpgtThank you for contacting ltemgtMake it to the Finish Lineltemgt.

I wish to extract a large number of rows and columnsthe indices of which I know in advance, though it will in fact be all rows and columns that are not allzeroto get a new square matrix approx 10,000 x 10,000.p  pThe fastest way I have found to do this isp  precodegt timeit A[np.ixindices, indices] 1 loops, best of 3 6.19 s per loop codepre  pHowever, this is much slower than the time it takes to do matrix multiplicationp  precodegt timeit np.multiplyA, A 1 loops, best of 3 982 ms per loop codepre  pThis seems strange, since both the rowcolumn extraction and matrix multiplication need to allocate a new array which will be even larger for the result of the matrix multiplication than for the extraction, but matrix multiplication also needs to perform additional computation.p  pThus, the question is there a more efficient way to perform the extraction, in particular, that is at least as fast as matrix multiplicationp

Negative 88865 pstrongThe Setupstrongp  pFor a C crossplatform project, I have several readonly lookup tables in SQLite. The one Im concerned with at the moment profiling indicates it takes 72 of the algorithms complete time is rather simple. Given a table with four columns, all of them 64bit integers, find the unique entry in column four given the first three. In other wordsp  precodeSELECT  FROM tablename WHERE A1 AND B2 AND C3 codepre  pThe actual lookups are being done in chunks, where A and B are fixed and C is retrieved from a vector. Ive also got a covering index think thats what its called my index is on A,B,C, and D, even though I only use A, B, and C to do the lookups. Or p  precodeCREATE INDEX coveredindex ON tablenameA, B, C, D codepre  pMy code calls every combination of A and B chunking. The subcode takes a vector that has a class with C in it then I do a calculation for every entry in the vector based on its D, which is looked up based on the passed in A, B and the vector entrys C. In other wordsp  precodeclass Foo     int64t someC    ...   ...   This will be called once for every combination of A, B void Barconst stdvectorltclass Foogt ampfooVector, int64t fixedA, int64t fixedB      forint i  0 i lt fooVector.size i              int64t d  GetDfixedA, fixedB, fooVector[i].someC         do a calculation based on D         Reuse the prepared select statement SELECT  FROM tablename WHERE A1 AND B2 AND C3 int64t GetDint64t a, int64t b, int64t c      reset     binda, 1     bindb, 2     bindc, 3     ifstep  SQLITEROW              return getInt64FromColumn4           Throw an error if the select fails ...  codepre  pThis calling method is combinatorial  ON IIRC, so even a tiny improvement can make a huge difference. The data sets are expected to get somewhat large for tiny data sets what Ive got right now is sufficient. The code needs to work for both Linux amp Windows, and its expected to be ported to Android where memory is at a premium.p  pIm using a covering index where A and B are first, so I dont expect data localization to be a problem. Compression  codeVACUUMcode  if Im reading the docs right, wont do anything for me since my tables have no deleted entries. I downloaded the latest SQLite last night, and that doesnt seem to make a difference. Im also using a cutoff to not bother doing the read and calculation outside of certain boundaries which gives a 5600 improvement by itself. I also tried reading all of the D values for a given A, B as inp  precodeSELECT  FROM tablename WHERE A1 AND B2 codepre  pand storing the results in a map codestdmapltint64t, int64tgtcode for C, D a sort of primitive cache  but this approach actually significantly emworsenedem performance  the combination of map inserts and steps doubled or tripled the amount of time required.p  pSo far I emhaventem used codeANALYZEcode or defined the database as read only in the DB open. Im willing to try that, but unsure as to what to expect as far as performance goes. My colleague suggested further chunking the reads, but Im not sure how to accomplish that at this point.p  pThe time for the coderesetcode, codebindcode, and codegetInt64FromColumn4code methods is trivial  they are simple wrappers on the SQLite C API and take negligible amounts of time. p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pIs there anything Im missing here to improve read performance I only need to worry about read performance the databases themselves will be generated elsewhere and are not expected to change. More precisely, when they do change, the DB will be generated elsewhere and installed via file copy.p

Negative 88865 pWere considering replacing some or many classic SOAP XML WCF calls by JSON WCF or other calls, because of the lower overhead and ease of use directly in Javascript. For now, weve just added an additional Json endpoint to our web service and added WebInvoke attributes to some operations and tested them. Everything works fine, using C .Net clients or Javascript clients. So far so good.p  pHowever, it seems like deserializing big JSON strings to objects in C .Net is much slower than deserializing SOAP XML. Both are using DataContract and DataMember attributes exact same DTO. My question is is this expected Is there anything we can do to optimize this performance Or should we consider JSON only for smaller requests where we DO notice performance improvements.p  pFor now weve chosen JSON.net for this test and even though it doesnt show in this test case, its supposed to be faster than the .Net JSON serialization. Somehow the ServiceStack deserialization does not work at all no error, returns null for the IList.p  pFor the test we do a service call to collect a list of rooms.

Negative 88865 pIm a beginner in Symfony2 and total new comer to Sonata. So far I managed to do few simple things with Sonata lists, edits etc and now trying to extend some standard functionality.p  pAt the moment Im a bit lost on creating a list view for a child of the main entity. Example. Letd say I want to add revisions for the main entity class. So I have two classes  CustomEntity and CustomEntityyRevision. Each CustomEntityRevision is related to Entity by ID. I have CustomEntityAdmin class defined and this is were the standard list view is configured. That lists all entities in the system. Then added a custom action that is supposed to open new route admintestbundlecustomentityIDrevisions and list all revisions related to the parent CustomEntity.p  pHow would I configure a list view for revisions action p  pMy first assumption was to define list view in the revisionsAction in the CustomEntity controller and use em to simply run a query and get collection of revisions related to CustomEntity ID. But would this be doable thru configuring list similar to how its done thru Admin classp

Negative 88865 pGood morning Gurus,p  pIve been searching for this for over a week. Ive tried a few solutions but none of them seems to be working for me. I have this old web site created not by me, by someone else using VS2003 with .NET 1.1 and now I need to upgrade to .NET 2.0 no newer versions allowed. I created a new virtual directory in my local IIS environment, changes de App Pool to 2.0, put the solution there and opened it with VS2005. This solution contains 5 the main project and 4 more in charge of DB connections and other tasks... kind of a N tiers project projects inside. After VS2005 performs the conversion there are 2 of those projects that are returning the following errorp  blockquote   pThe project file must be opened in the Visual Studio IDE and converted   to the latest version before it can be built by MSBuildp blockquote  pI have triedp  ol liRunning MSbuild [projname] from the command promptli liComparing CSPROJ files to see any differencesli liUnloading and loading the project againli liUsing VS2010 to do the conversion gave me about 200 errorsli ol  pI just cannot figure out what is the difference. I compared the CSPROJ with the other 2 project that seems to pass the conversion and they seem the same.p  pIf it is relevant the application was done using C CSPROJ  CS stands for CSharp...p  pPlease share a little light for me with this. I was just want to be pointed to the right track to fix this because honestly I do not know what else to do.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 88865 pIm transitioning some of my current CSS to SASS, and truly enjoying it however, I am running into an issue regarding use of variables.  Im trying to refactor the components out of the main CSS into their own components.  I am using Bootstraps SASS port as a guide for this.  p  pI am trying to set up themes, so Im overriding the variables prior to importing the components however, if I do this, the components do not inherit the new values.

However, if I do not refactor the buttons component and keep in the main SCSS, it does get overridden.  I am clearly missing something.p  pThanks, Steven M.p  pEdit  Thank you,Cimmanon, I have focused the question now.p

Negative 88865 pA a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma27168696596781recent questiona drew my attention to the way that a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg21docspapers2013n3652.html relnofollowcodeconstexprcode has changed in C14a.

Negative 88865 pIm beginning a project where I would like to slice sections from a single video and redraw those sections onto different objects on the screen.  I know I can do this by using drawImage to redraw the sections of the video onto a canvas element.  In doing research, it appears that it would be possible to do the same thing with an animated texture in WebGL.  Does anyone know if there would be any performance gains by using a WebGL animated texture to do this rather than drawImage p
Negative 88865 pI have an external C program that I need to calculate codencode times for different input types. I want to do this in parallel. Because Im using python to calculate the different input parameters for each simulation and for the postprocessing of the data Im doing that now with the codemultiprocessingcode package. p  pIm creating a cue of processes manually and then loop over this cue and run the processes. However, the codeProcesscode object calls the external program and then moves on. This results in more than p  pI first defined two helperfunctions.

It just started all 100 simulations one after another, not waiting for the external C routine to finish. This approach does I dont know why the codeProcess.isalivecode returns true if the external c is still running, but maybe the solution can be found here. So I need a way to prevent codesim.runSolvercode from returning while the underlying process is not yet finished. p

Negative 88865 pI am trying to add an antbased Android build into a greater gruntbased build system. However, when ant is invoking codejavaccode, its redirecting codejavaccodes stderr to stdout when adding the code[javac]code prefix to the console output. Unfortunately, this means that grunt is discarding the useful error output unless I run it in verbose mode  which Id rather not do.p  pHowever, redirecting codeantcodes stdout to stderr causes a different problem, in that the grunt build interprets emanyem stderr as an error to abort on.p  pWhat I would like for ant to do is to keep codejavaccodes stderr output on stderr so that I see why my build failed, and stdout on stdout. I dont see anything in Androids codebuild.xmlcode that would affect this, however, nor has ants documentation been useful.p  pAnd, of course, simply porting the ant codebuild.xmlcode logic to just be part of the grunt build is a rather large undertaking that Id rather not do at this time.p  pSo, is there some option to codeantcode or Androids codebuild.xmlcode that Im missing that is behind the stderr redirection, or is there some other approach to actually getting my error output to display as an errorp

The user will get lots of notice of this.li liThere is no reference to purchasing Multi User in the app and at no point in the app do we link to an external place for you to purchase it. It is all done via email.li ul  pLooking at the rulesp  blockquote   p7.1 Apps that unlock or enable additional features or functionality with mechanisms other than the App Store will be rejected, except in cases where the application hosts plugins or extensionsp      p7.2 Apps utilizing a system other than the In App Purchase API IAP to purchase content, functionality, or services in an App will be rejectedp blockquote  pDo you think our plans obey the rules I know its ok to offer subscriptions outside of the app store, even at a different price, but a different type of subscription thats not even listed in the appp  pVery interested in your view.p

Negative 88865 pTo use uisearchdisplaycontroller to specify a search on specific array fields, I found that the syntax caters only to keyvalue dictionary data. Now, when I need to sort an array, I see again that the methods cater to key references, not mere array indexing. Ive built complex data with keyless arrays, not dictionaries. Do I understand correctly that I should default to using dictionaries everywhere Is there any situation to use plain arraysp  pI see now the KeyValue Coding Guide document 1812 of 3894... should get to it any minute now.p

However, I still dont know why the second method converges so much more easily in my real world scenario than the first. All the test cases have very simple functions codefcode whereas the real world codefcode has several hundred lines of code which is why I dont want to post it. So maybe the complexity of codefcode is important. If you have any additional insight into this, let me knowp

Negative 88865 pI am rewriting an application for printing shipping labels that we have been using for many years, because over those many years, many programmers have added bits and pieces to it, and it has become harder and harder to maintain.p  pWhile considering design choices, I came across catching the applications StartUp event in ApplicationEvents.vb, which I thought would be a good choice for this application because the main form is only displayed if there are more than 10 labels to print at a time displays a progress bar if so, but mostly it does one label at a time and as such the progress bar isnt desired.p  pNow, whether this is a good choice Im not sure, but while playing around with it I have found a need to exit the application from this event if certain criteria arent met invalid command line args, network directory not found in expected location, and a few other criteria. I have been unsuccessful in figuring out how to exit from the application if something like the above were to occur. The only thing close I have found is setting the codeStartupEventArgs.Cancelcode to codeTruecode, but the documentation states that this only stops the main form from loading and if set to true should point code on a different processing path.p  pIs there a proper way to exit the application in the StartUp event Ive tried using codeMy.Application.Shutdowncode which doesnt exist, and codeRaiseEvent ShutDowncode which gives the error Derived classes cannot raise base class events.p  pLinked here is the main doc I have been using for research and the related links on the linked page a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryt4zch4d2VS.80.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryt4zch4d2VS.80.aspxap

Negative 88865 pI was looking at the AltBeacon library, and am planning on using it. But before doing that, I have few questions in general more theoretical in nature. If someone can help me understand, it would be great.p  pa Is there a way to make sure that the AltBeacon advertisement is UNIQUE. In a sense that, no one else can by mistake not be using the same UUID, major and minor Ids in their beacon. Because if that happens, our application run a risk of identifying another companys beacon and malfunction and also viceversa.p  pb As far as I am aware, any device with BLE enabled can scan and get the codes of any beacon in surrounding. This exposes beacons UUID, Major ID, Minor ID, RSSI etc which poses security risks to the application owners like say, someone elses app working on my beacons hijacking of sorts, modifying the entire Beacon advertisement codes, etc.p  pSo, I wish to know is there any solution workarounds to these available right now in AltBeacon spec and library itself Or are they in queue I am not sure, whether this is something that can be done at the library level itself, or Android level or may be Bluetooth LE specification needs to incorporate these. I know Apple and some other companies have rolled out their security features like restricting scanning to your own beacons, rotating Beacon IDs etc. Is there something of this sort there or planned on AltBeacon end as wellp

Negative 88865 pI recently got this error when Previewing an Item from Sitecore, and I thought the fix for this was to rebuild the Master Index, however the problem still lies here.p  precodeCould not find file HIDDENSITEdataindexessystemsegmentsk281. codepre  pMy other thought is now, that there might be some corrupted files in the system folder, and that needs to be emptied out and have the site rebuild again. However, my concerns here are if Im gonna lose any site data WHAT SO EVER, if I delete everything in the system folder and try to rebuild the indexes of Master, Core and Web. The most important part of this process is that content must NOT be changed or deleted in any way.p

Negative 88865 pI am building a web application which plays a single stream of audio when the user clicks a button. At least, thats the goal.  I am using audio.js. It works fine on desktop browsers, if I use a click event or if I use the touch event thats the code below when emulating an iPhone. However, as I saw with many other posts, I ran into problems when trying to actually run it on a mobile browser. Upon clicking the button in the mobile browser, its as if it is not detecting the ended event listener. The audio does not play and it gets stuck in the document.body.className  talking state see code in the function playAudio below. It never moves back into neutral state. Im rather new to this so I apologize if Ive missed something obvious but Ive tried many of the suggestions on other posts and I just cannot figure out what obvious thing it is that I am missing.p  precodelt Page LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue CodeBehindquinn.aspx.cs InheritsQuinnSDS.quinn validateRequestfalse gt  ltDOCTYPE htmlgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt lthead runatservergt     ltmeta nameapplemobilewebappcapable contentyesgt     ltmeta nameviewport contentwidth  devicewidthgt     lttitlegtlttitlegt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssrobotui.cssgt  ltheadgt ltbody class neutral gt     ltform idform1 runatservergt         ltdiv ideyesgtltdivgt         ltdiv idmouthgtltdivgt         ltbutton idtestButton classaction ontouchstartgtTestingltbuttongt         ltdiv idoverlaygtltdivgt       ltformgt      ltscript srcjsaudio.jsgtltscriptgt    ltscriptgt         document.addEventListenertouchend, function e              playAudio         , false         function playAudio             var music  new Audiofilestransformed.wav             music.addEventListenerended, function                  document.body.className  neutral                         document.body.className  talking            music.play              ltscriptgt ltbodygt   lthtmlgt codepre  pOnce I solve why its not playing on a button click, I ultimately need to somehow trigger the audio to download and play automatically on a timed event. On a normal browser, I simply had a timer which triggered a check to the server. If the check was true, the server would refresh the page and the audio would download and play on the page load. Given the limitations on iOS Im not sure how Im going do this on a mobile browser  I was thinking that perhaps I could use Websockets and have the server push the audio when its available. After the first user interaction, I believe you can then play audio whenhow you want If anyone has any suggestions on this particular problem as well, all advice is welcomep

The implication is that a caller to codegetcode can be optimised as if it were using a constant in place of codegetcode only when the integer constant is static.p  pI have more complex situations where codestaticcode is not appropriate.  Derived classes initialise codexcode to different values through the constructor but to each of those classes codexcode is a constant and those class methods could be optimised, as with the preceeding codestaticcode case, if only codegetcode evaluated to a true constant.p  pIn fact, my commonest case is with the initialisation of references in the base classp  precodeclass Foo  intamp x public Foointamp init  xinit  inline int get  return x   class Bar  public Foo  int m public Bar  Foom  inline int getget  return get  int fn1Baramp b  return b.getget  codepre  pHere, if codegetcode evaluated directly to codeBarmcode within codegetgetcode I would avoid a level of pointer indirection.  This will not be possible if codexcode is static.p  pIts not clear to me why codestaticcode is necessary to allow this optimisation.p

Something like thisp  precode    customer.factoryservice, function       var auth         auth.currentUser  null       auth.setCurrentUser  functiondata       auth.currentUser  data            return auth       codepre  pThis worked perfectly for me until I hit the strongrefreshstrong button of the browser, all information stored in Javascript variable are lost. p  pTo solve this problem, do I have to use cookieStore or something similar I have seen few people mentioning uiroute, I cant quite get my head around it. Is uiroute relevant to this discussion Also I would like to use the same solution to save authentication token for the logged in user. p  pWhat is your general opinion around this issue Thank you so much in advance.p

Negative 88865 pI am very new to Typo3 and trying to create a onepage website with Typo3 and with this tree structure p  pPage 1 the onepager p  psection1  section 1 of the onepagerp  psection2  section 2 of the onepagerp  petc..p  pPage 2 normal pagep  ppage 3 normal pagep  pI tried first with the fluidtypo3 extension site kickstarter and following this tutorial a hrefhttpsworksonmymachine.orgblogonepagedesignwithfluidtypo3 relnofollowhttpsworksonmymachine.orgblogonepagedesignwithfluidtypo3a and with some help on stackoverflow, I actually managed to make a onepager. But I cant figure out how to adapt it, and make it so, that each section of the onepager has its own template, and several columns to render, according to the pages backend layout. I guess, I could have all the sections on the one page template and have them rendered, referencing which columns should be rendered. But this is assuming no one will add more pages or sections to the onepager in the typo3 backend. It would be nicer, if the addition of section is automatic. I probably missed something or didnt see something very obviousp  pWell after that, I looked up Fluid Templating, and learned how to make normal websites with fluid. Then with my apprentice skills and online tutorials, I tried to make the one page through Typoscript. While I did manage to grab the contents of each section or subpage and place them into one page, the same problem arose I do not know how to hook up each section to the corresponding template. p  pAny tip Tutorial that I could look up Or in which direction I should start my approach p  pAny kind of help is very welcome p

Negative 88865 pCurrently I am investigating a migration to RxJava and decided that  a manager of mineaccountManager would be an interesting place to start.

End updatep  pI have a project in Visual Studio 2015. I can build and run it successfully on my local machine. It uses Newtonsoft.Json JSON.net which it obtains from Nuget. When I check in, and my continuous integration build runs on the build server, it throws an exception that it cannot locate the JSON.net assembliesp  precodeThe type or namespace name Newtonsoft could not be found are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference  CWindowsMicrosoft.NETFramework64v4.0.30319Microsoft.Common.targets 1605 Could not resolve this reference.

If this reference is required by your code, you may get compilation errors. codepre  pI have looked all over to see what is causing the Nuget package to fail. Is it because I am using Visual Studio 2015 Is Nuget jacked upp  pHas anyone experienced this issuep
