Positive 2512 pI am currently trying to create an Android app, for my ALevel Computing Practical Project, which stores a users calendartimetable within a MySQL database and can be accessed by logging into the app. I want to be able to make it so that you can access the calendar from any device as long as you are logged in so I was just wondering what the best way to do this would be as the ways in which I have thought of so far will end up using large amounts of space over time and I wish to prevent this.p  pCurrently I am thinking about creating a table which stores all of the users calendars by their email address, I will then have a field which contains an array of all of the events. I know that this is very inefficient and was wondering if anyone could give me any ideas into how I could do this I would be extremely grateful.p  pI am also willing to change the method of doing this as I am not stuck with using MySQLp
Positive 2512 pCant figure this one out maybe someone can help. We have a user in the office that wants to filter her calendar events, that when she views the calendar of her boss she will only sees updates made in the meeting by the event owner and her bosses updates should not be shown.p  pTried to filter this using outlook rules and Conditional Formatting but was not able to find a solution to the task. Can anyone suggest best approach for this p

Positive 2512 pI have a WatchKit Application that grabs the users calendar events and displays them in a list. The app runs pretty fast when there arent a lot of events 1015 events, but when multiple events and multiple calendars are involved 30 events, the scrolling becomes very laggy and the list keeps constantly refreshing.p  pObviously the watch wasnt designed to handle a lot of data at once, so the only options I considered are having a Loading... label or animation to display while the data is being retrieved, or I could run the data retrieval in the background on the iOS app, and then send the data to the watch kit app when its done, because the iOS app can retrieve the data a lot faster.p  pIm leaning toward the second option, the only problem is how do I implement this. Should I use app groupsp

Negative 2512 pIm looking for the most basic description of how to draw text within a JPanel. I know there are a billion tutorials out there but none of them are clicking with me and I have some specific questions which may help others who are confused. As a setup a testing app I have a single class which has a JLabel, a JTextField, a JButton, and a JPanel. The application reads in ints from an external file and should display their average in the panel when the JButton is pressed. I have all the underlying programing sorted out that is, the button responds and prints the average to the command line but I just cannot seem to sort out how to print the average to the panel. I guess my biggest question is how to incorporate the paint or paintComponet method in along with the rest of the code. Should it be its own class Should the JPanel be its own class It seems like thats what most of the tutorials are telling me, Im just not sure what the first step is exactly.

Negative 2512 pIm creating a RESTful API which needs to access the database.  Im using Restish, Oracle, and SQLAlchemy.

Negative 2512 pIm creating a set of search panes that allow users to tweak their results set after submitting a query.

So, if a lot of rows in our results were created in 2009, well be able to click 2009 and see only rows created in that year.p  pWhat in your opinion is the most efficient way of applying these filters My working solution was to discard entries from the results that didnt match the extra arguments, likep  precodewhilerow  mysqlfetchassocquery      foreachGET as key gt val          ifval  row[key]              continue 2                    Output...  codepre  pThis method should hopefully only query the database once in effect, as adding filters doesnt change the query  MySQL can cache and reuse one data set. On the downside it makes pagination a bit of a headache.p  pThe obvious alternative would be to build any additional criteria into the initial query, something likep  precodesql  SELECT  FROM tbl MATCH title, description AGAINST searchterm foreachGET as key gt var      sql .  AND .key.  .var  codepre  pAre there good reasons to do this instead Or are there better options altogether Maybe a temporary table Any thoughts much appreciatedp

It is      used to make sure each word is only displayed once.     vector ltboolgt checkedWord words.size, false      forint i  0 i lt words.size i          if checkedWord[i]             outFile ltlt                forint j  i j lt words.size j                 ifequivalentWordswords[i], words[j], outFile                      outFile ltlt words[j] ltlt                       checkedWord[j]  true                                           outFile ltlt n                       codepre  pIn my python code below, rather than having a second vector, I have a list words of lists of a string, a sorted list of the chars in the former string because strings are immutable, and a bool that tells if the word has been checked yet. However, I cant figure out how to change a value as you iterate through a list.p  precode    for word, sword, checked in words     if not checked         for word1, sword1, checked1 in words             if sword1  sword                 checked1  True  this doesnt work                 print word1,         print  codepre  pAny help on doing this or thinking more Pythony is appreciated.p
Negative 2512 pBecause I rush in development a lot of whip cracking here and declare my objects at the top of the function and instantiate inside my trycatch block, I get a lot of the good old object not set to an instance of an object errors while doing TDD, and later if I do miss a branch that object was used in doing VB now, would prefer C or just in every day coding,  object not set to an instance of an object is a bit vague. Sure the stack trace sends me to the line the error occured at, but it would be nice if I could modify my logging to either name the object or its type because sometimes I have multiple objects on the same line. Its not the end of the world, but in the end it would save me a few minutes each day. Any ideas on how I can pass the info on which object wasnt set Thanksp

Negative 2512 pI have what should be a relatively simple task thats frankly got me stumped. Ive researched it until my brain is fried, and now Im punting, and asking you guys for help. p  pHeres the scenariop  ul liI have an ASPX page Q2.aspx that is decorated with the codeWebServicecode, codeWebServiceBindingcode, and codeScriptServicecode attributes.  li liThat page contains a method, codeGetAllContactscode, that is decorated with the codeWebMethodcode attribute and returns a string containing JSON data. For what its worth, the page itself contains no other controls or functionality.li liI have an HTML page that contains JavaScript which uses the codeXmlHttpRequestcode object to invoke the codeGetAllContactscode WebMethod on the ASPX page and transform the JSON data into an HTML table. li liI have verified that my codeWeb.Configcode file contains the appropriate protocol handlers for codeHttpGetcode and codeHttpPutcode in the codeWebServicescode section under codeSystem.Web.webServicescode.li liI have verified that my codeWeb.Configcode file contains the codeScriptModulecode entry under the codeSystem.webServer.modulescode section, and that it matches the appropriate documentation.li ul  pHowever, when I view the HTML page in a browser, the following occurp  ul liThe web request goes through, but the results are for the unprocessed HTML from the ASPX page.li liThe codeGetAllContactscode method is never invoked, as evidenced by setting a breakpoint in its code.li liThe code to invoke the Web service, however, is invoked, and the JavaScript callback function that is invoked upon request completion is properly invoked. li ul  pIt appears that the JavaScript code is largely set up correctly, but for some reason that is completely escaping me at this point, the HTML page will simply not execute the codeWebMethodcode on the ASPX page, and simply returns the page as though it were a plain HTML codeGETcode request. Clearly, an HTML document cant be evaluated by JavaScripts codeevalcode function, which brings me to my problem. Also note that the JSON data appears nowhere in the HTML thats returned.p  pI am, frankly, baffled. Ive looked at dozens of Microsoft articles, StackOverflow posts, CodeProject articles, and who knows what else. My code emlooksem like its okay. But I know better.

Negative 2512 pHi I am currently trying to building a reader app for the iphone, a bit like NYTimes iphone app or Time magazine or USA today iphone app. Basically Ill be parsing a feed containing articles, saving the data locally in a database and displaying stuff and all that.p  pNow I am just starting off with Iphone app development, I would just like to know what is the best way to manage Images in these sort of apps. Id like to save the images for each article locally. Which is the preferred method for doing so, saving it into a database or saving it to the file system. There are a lot of images and managing them would be easier if i store it in a blob field in the database, but that would affect performance dramatically I guess. Saving it into the filesystem, in the application documents directory would give me better performance but I am wondering how would I manage a large amount of file Saving it, keeping track of an Image of a particular article, deleting files etcp
Negative 2512 pDo you think having TRANSACTION around every sql statements in stored procedures is a good practice Just about to optimise this legacy application in my company, one thing I found is that every stored procedures has BEGIN TRANSACTION. Even a simple select and Update statement has one. I thought it would be nice to have BEGIN TRANSACTION if one is performing a multiple actions i.e. multiple inserts or Updates or Delete but not just one action insert or update or delete. I may be wrong thats why I need someone else to advice me. THanks for your time guys.p

My question is this, if the gurus in this forum can help me find a reasonable solution. The approach suggested in JxCapture does not seem to be overly complex. Any hints A visual basic script or some C code that does this would be a good starting point.p  pI was of the belief that when the window is hidden, if I send a keypress event or a mouse press event to it, it would force it to redraw itself and hence allow itself to be captured even by codejava.awt.Robotcode. That was an illusion and it doesnt work.p  pOn the other hand, the message in the JxCapture thread is from the year 2006 could it be that Sun has included such a feature since then and Im just not aware of itp

Negative 2512 pI am new to openGL and I am reading the redbook. Now, as an exercise I want to manually draw a sphere. For that I am dividing the sphere into slices and stacks, and thus I get multiple rectangles, but near the poles of the sphere I get triangles. hope this was clear what I am doing. Now I know that if you draw a polygon with GLPOLYGON and it happens to intersect itself, the behavior is undefined.

Negative 2512 pI have been working on an ASP.NET MVC 2 app similar to SQL MDS. The app which we call as ADMIN app is for implementors to setup non transactional customer data to bring them on board. p  pThe app was however built for targetting a SQL DB on a single environment UATLIVEQA etc. In a nutshell the app is deployed together with DB.p  pThe new requirement is  app should target multiple DBs. In other words a customer data keyed in should be stagedmigrated to UAT amp subsequently to LIVE environment. This will ensure customer data does not have to be keyed in multiple times. This new requirement has caught me offguard.p  pI cannot go with single site targetting multiple DBs coz the environments are seggregated and no cross env network access is allowed. Which is fair. p  pAnother approach I was thinking was to export the entitties objectgraph as a package since I am using LINQ2SQL to be imported into the next environment using serializedeserialize. However I am afraid I might run into issues with IDs and referential integrity. Has anyone tried thisp  pAs I use DIIoC so the architecture is loosely coupled.  What other solutions could I try without much recourse to development efforts Should I go with a Winform approach and mandate implementors to have network access to all the SQL serversp  pAny thoughts will be very much appreciated...

Negative 2512 pI am having problems finding the width of a string of text in a UITextField object. I know there are various methods documented to ostensibly do this, but they simply do not work.  There is one and only one method that produces a correct value, but requires the use of the textField property of an mx.controls.Text object.  If that textField is used, then getCharBoundaries works correctly, and you can just add up the returned widths from a series of calls to it to get the width of a string of text.  p  pHowever, if you just call getCharBoundaries on a standalone TextField or UITextField i.e. one that is not a property of MXText then getCharBoundaries returns some entirely different value that is substantially less than if called on the textField property of an MxText object. It is in fact about 25 smaller than the correct value, but that is not even consistent, because change the font size and the discrepancy seems to vary nonlinearly.  So what getCharBoundaries is actually returning in the case of a standalone UITextField, I have no idea. p  pBut actually, call any other method for determining text width of a TextField other than getCharBoundaries within an MXText object , and youll get the same erroneous value  TextField.getUITextFormat.measureHTMLText....width or measureText, and TextField.getLineMetrics....width all return this same erroneous value.  And you might say, Well theyre probably just returning the width from left most pixel in the text to righmost pixel, except as I said to begin with, in one instance getCharBoundaries is actually returning the total cell width of the text, which is what I want, and then when called from a standalone Textfield some completely different value.p  pBut my problem first appeared when I tried to change an MXText object within which I could call getCharBoundaries successfully to a UITextField.  So now neither getCharBoundaries or anything else works correctly for determining text width.  Note Im not actually displaying the UITextfield, but rather am using it for text processing purposes behind the scenes, as it is significantly faster than MXText. I set UITextField.htmlText to a value, then make a series of calls to getTextFormat, setTextFormat, and replaceText.  And it all works as before with the MxText object, except much faster.  Only problem is there is now apparently no way to determine text width for a string of text, even though Adobe documents all these methods that are supposed to do that.p  pAnd so my question is,  I get on google, and there is very little commentary on this, and no work around at all that I have seen documented anywhere.  I did see one thread on actionscript.org from a couple of years ago, where someone else also said that all these width methods simply do not work.  There was confirmation of this by someone, but no resolution provided.  Note this poster noted that the error seemed to escalate with increasing font sizes and was not as noticeable at small font sizes, which I suppose may explain why it doesnt seemed to have been noticed.p  pBut I downloaded Flex 4 here a while ago, and the problem is still there.  So just wondering if I am truly the only person who is cognizant of this, or has encountered it, or possibly someone point out what Im missing.  I guess the Flex Bug tracking system would be an option for me, but that would probably be a Black Hole.  p  pSo anyway, just wondering if anyones encountered this or found a work around.p

Negative 2512 pI am working on code for Scrolling Game Development Kit.  An old release 2.0 of this program was based on DirectX and was using Direct3D Sprite objects to draw all the graphics.  It used the Transform property of the sprite object to specify how the texture rectangle would be transformed as it was being output to the display.  The current release 2.1 was a conversion to OpenGL and is using GL TexCoord2 and GL Vertex2 calls to send coordinates of the source and output rectangles for drawing sprites.  Now someone says that their video card worked great with DirectX, but their OpenGL drivers do not support GLARB necessary to use NPOTS textures pretty basic.  So Im trying to go back to DirectX without reverting everything back to 2.0.  Unfortunately it seems its much easier to get 4 points given a matrix than it is to get a matrix given 4 points.  I have done away with all the matrix info in version 2.1 so I only have the 4 corner points left when calling the function that draws images on the display.

Negative 2512 pSuppose that I have a complete, undirected graph G with a distance associated with each edge.  The meaning of edge u, v having length l is points u and v cant be any closer to each other than l.  My goal is to lay the nodes of this graph out in a plane so that none of these distance constraints are violated and such that the convex hull of the points has the least total area.  As an example, suppose that I have a bunch of electrical components I want to put onto a chip, each of which generates some amount of electrical interference.  If I put the components too close together, theyll start interfering with one another, rendering the whole system useless.  Given the minimum distances each point should be from each other point, whats the most spaceefficient way of putting the components on a chipp  pI have no idea how to even start thinking about this.  I also dont know how the problem might generalize to the higherdimensional case packing points into a hyperplane.  Does anyone know of a good way of tackling this problemp

Negative 2512 pI have a custom clipping plane that changes orientation in an app Im writing. Id like to be able to get the equation to that clipping plane at certain times.

Any ideas on how to debug this error or on correct usage of this function I have the plane equation that is used to create the clipping plane for each frame, but several transformations are applied to the scene before the clipping is actually applied, which causes the equation of the clip plane to change drastically. p

Negative 2512 pIm planning some experiments in symbolic execution of C code, using an offtheshelf SMT solver, and wondering which solver to use looking at e.g. the SMT contest entrants, and taking only the opensource systems, narrows it down to Beaver, Boolector, CVC3, OpenSMT, Sateen, Sonolar, STP, Verit which is still a long list.p  pTrying to narrow it down a little further, I notice that some of the systems advertise the ability to handle bit vector arithmetic, whereas others only advertise the ability to handle general integer arithmetic. In principle, the former is correct for C, where variables are machine words, not unbounded integers. How much difference does it make in practice What happens if you try to use a general integer system for this kind of job Does one of the following scenarios applyp  ol lipA bit vector system is slightly more efficient, but you can use either, no problem.pli lipYou can use a general integer system with a bit of tweaking.pli lipA general integer system is fine for signed int because the result of overflow is undefined but will give the wrong answer for unsigned.pli lipA general integer system just isnt correct for machine word arithmetic, and I can reduce my short list to only those systems that provide bit vector arithmetic.pli lipSomething else...pli ol  pIve tried to ask as specific a question as possible, but if anyone can suggest any other criteria for narrowing down the list, that would be greatp

Negative 2512 pAs a bit of background  Im using JBoss 5.1, for web applications. The applications are vertically deployed so each feature ends up in a separate WAR file. It has a jar file for dao and business logic. This is fine so far however I need to deploy another app which doesnt have much logic in itself  its basically a view like say dashboard. The dashboard needs to aggregate data from different data providersusually they are other appsfeatures. Right now the dashboard knows way too much about other features. So everytime a new feature is added this dashboard gets redeployed as well with relevant code additions.p  pIt would be great if there is a common interface for this dashboard that few other features implement and whenever a new featureWAR is deployed the dashboard can dynamically get data from the new provider as well. Is this possible If not what is the closest I can get to without manipulating classloaders for the apps It would be good to know if first of all this is possible inside jboss.p  pPlease let me know if you need more info.p

Negative 2512 pIn some views of my Django app, two instances of the same form are rendered, one is included via a context processor, and the other is included by the view. The only difference between the two forms are the styling and position, they have the same fields and submit to the same view.p  pThen I notices that the IDs of the elements are the same, and some functionality, like the label click that focus the corresponding field, behaves wrong, like focusing the same field on the other form. Then I added a form prefix to the first form and of course the labels worked again.p  pBut the prefix is also applied to the fields names besides the IDs, and therefore, the view that get the submitted data didnt work, since the form instance was initialized without the prefix. Also, the query string looks even weirder p  pIm looking for a solution that keeps the original fields names, not prefixed, and still use prefixed HTML IDs, so the view keeps working unchanged. Or any other way of rendering two forms with isolated ids but the same field names.p

Negative 2512 pIm dealing with an old Motif application that needs to load and display a long list of entries around 1500. It creates and manages an instance of xmFormWidgetClass via XtVaCreateManagedWidget and then it stuffs it with a bunch of linear hierarchies xmFrameWidgetClassxmFormWidgetClassxmFormWidgetClassxmPushButtonWidgetClass. Each PushButton contains a multiline label. When this this thing is being populated, it takes a lot of CPU, which it spends doing some geometry calculations inside of XMotif libraries. The pace at which new buttons are added, degrades very quickly. It looks like there is an ON algorithm being used inside of XtVaCreateManagedWidget.p  pThe things get much much better if I do XtUnrealizeWidget on the original instance of the xmFormWidgetClass. Entries are being added at almost constant speed but then I cannot find a way to display the whole thing that I built. XtRealizeWidget for the original instance of the xmFormWidgetClass does not render it in the window.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Is there a way to populate the hierarchy and then calculate the geometry and render it to the screen at oncep  pRedesigning the application is an option but it is a last resort type on an option.p  pAny advice that keeps me within Motif libraries will be highly appreciatedp  pRegards, Sergeyp

Negative 2512 pI am writing a custom web browser using Visual Basic .NET and would like to attach event handlers to certain html elements in certain frames on a loaded web page.p  pSpecifically, Im trying to select a Frame in the loaded document using a constant String array of names, and attach an event handler to all or some elements in that frame when clicked.p  pTo do this, in the WebBrowserDocumentCompleted method I use the following codep  precodeDim Frames As HtmlWindowCollection  CurrentBrowser.Document.Window.Frames      For Each Frame As HtmlWindow In Frames         For Each FrameName As String In MYFRAMENAMES              If Frame.Name.EqualsFrameName Then                 For Each Element As HtmlElement In Frame.Document.All                     Element.AttachEventHandleronclick, AddressOf CurrentBrowserLinkClicked                 Next             End If         Next     Next codepre  pHowever, I usually get an UnauthorizedAccessException from Frame.Name.Equals. p  pIs there a different better way to get an html frame or iframe from either its name or id How do I suppress the UnauthorizedAccessExceptions Try...Catch blocks dont seem to work.p
Negative 2512 pIve posted about this before but have been struggling to come up with a solution.p  pBasically I have a HTML5jQuery app within my iPad app. Every time I load an image into the UIWebView HTML App the overall allocations in the profiler increases by about 2MB each time. This sounds about right because the image is approx 2MBs. I am using the data notation in the  tag to load a Base64 image.p  pi.e. p  pWhen I load a certain number of images page turns the app will crash.p  pThe app is an ebook viewer, so when I turn to a new not previously loaded in current session the allocations increase. But, if I turn back to a previiously loaded page the allocations dont increase and the page loads quicker than a new one. Every page turn sends a request to the database so im beginning to think the leak isnt in the iOS and that it could be in the HTML5 app.p  pAny ideas on this I guess there could just as easily be a leak in the HTML app as there could be in iOS. How do I go about debugging thisp  pAny ideas greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 2512 pIve just setup my server to allow php to be parsed within .html extension. This all works fine but, are there any reasons why I should not do this There is lots of documentation about how to set it up but, none of them go into any detail as to whether its a goodbad thing or makes absolutely no difference. p  pI could just create php pages but Ill be using such a small amount of php code header, menu, footer include that I dont really see the point. Ive heard that parsing html pages as php can be a little slower, if so, how much slower, and is it significant enough of a problem to be concerned about.p  pThanks, Jonnyp

Negative 2512 pI am doing some research into platform independent code and found mention of the dlfcn API. It was the first time I came across mention of it and did further research into it. Now hopefully my lack of experienceunderstanding of platform independent code as well as compilinglinking isnt going to show in this post but to me the dlfcn API just lets us do the same dynamic linking programmatically that the ld utility does. If I have misconceptions please correct me as I would like to know. Regarding what I think I know about the ld utility and the dlfcn API I have some questions.p  pstrongWhat are the advantages of using either the ld utility vs. dlfcn API to dynamically linkstrongp  pMy first thought was that the dlfcn API seems like a waste of my time since I need to request pointers to the functions vs. having ld examine a symbol table for undefined symbols and then linking them. Similarly ld does everything for me while I have to do everything by hand with the dlfcn API i.e. openload the library, get a function pointer, close the library, etc.. But on second glance I thought that there may be some advantages. One being that we can load a library out of memory after we are done using it.p  pIn this way memory could be saved if we knew we didnt need to utilize a library the whole time. I am unsure if there is any memorylibrary management for libraries dynamically linked by ld Similarly I am unsure of what scenariosenvironments would we be interested in using the dlfcn API to save said memory as it seems this wouldnt be a problem in modern day systems. I presume one would be the usage of the library on a system with very very very limited resources maybe some embedded system.p  pWhat other advantages or disadvantages may there bep  pstrongWhat coding pattern is used for platform independent code in regards to dynamic linkingstrongp  pIf I was making platform independent code that depended on system calls I could see myself achieving platform independent code by coding in one of three stylesp  ol liLogical branching directly in my libraries code via macros.

So any help on what to put inside this event to sharpen up the zoomed in view would be great. Thanks in advance.p

I am right, thinking that the send method of the Receiver interface class is always called if a Note is played on the Transmitter that the Receiver is connected to, aint I  If only that wouldnt work I could figure it out, but there are also some membervariables of the receiver that should save the number of keys that were hit, but these membervariables are always null. So my main problem here is, that the send method is never called. I hope i made clear what my main problem is.p  pEdit2 If you are into this whole midi programming in javathing and you dont see any major mistakes, then please tell me. I just found out that I cant get any Midisignals in Steinbergs Cubase either. Perhaps this time, the problem wasnt in front of the screen.p

Negative 2512 pIm trying to allow for large uploads when running Unicorn on Heroku with Rails but Ive realised that any large uploads might take longer than the timeout period for a Unicorn worker. This will mean Ive seen this happen that the Unicorn master process will kill the worker uploading the large file and the request will timeout with a 503 error.p  pWithout removing or massively increasing the timeout for my server is there any way to allow the uploading worker to hang while the upload completes Or, am I completely misunderstanding and its most likely something else that is causing my uploads to timeoutp
Negative 2512 pI have an ASP.NET website on a WinServer2k8 machine, which is protetced through Forms Authentication. At the moment, if one person logs in on Machine A, all login attempts on Machine B will fail A amp B are using the same internet connection to access the server. The login request doesnt return any errors, rather it simply redirects back to a login screen as though the authentication never happened. I would like to know how to configure this site either through IIS7 or a web.config file so that it will allow any number of simultaneous user sessions. All of the settings for the website are set to the IIS7 defaults. Ive tried changing sessionstate modes, the Maximum sessions property, and the Forms Authentication settings in IIS7.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pP.S.  I have also tested machines that are using a different IP Address for their internet connection and I am still unable to start a simultaneous session from that end as well.p  pP.P.S  If I attempt to start a session from a web browser on the server machine itself, it will work every time, regardless of who is logged in. Thoughtsp  pEDIT  Im using Windows session credentials for authentication  the method used by the webpage backend is LogonUser, which is imported from advapi32.dllp

Negative 2512 pIm trying to set up authentication on a local host and need a url, but third parties dont recognize localhost3000.

Negative 2512 pI have changed the way my facebook page tab app asks for permissions.p  pI was using the javascript approach with FB Dialog and now I am using the redirect approach in which the user is redirected to a FB page where the permissions are asked and then is redirected back to the facebook page tab.p  blockquote   pThe reason of the change is that I believe this approach will present   less bugs and issues than using the javascript dialogs.p blockquote  pWhen using the redirect approach, I need to specify the URL that the user will be redirected after providing permissions. I would like that this url was the url of the facebook page tab with the app installed.p  pWhen building the url of redirect, I know the current strongpageidstrong and my strongappidstrong. With these info, I need to build the facebook page tab url, which should look like thisp  pa hrefhttpswww.facebook.compagesPAGESLUG relnofollowhttpswww.facebook.compagesPAGESLUGaAPPIDskappAPPIDp  pThe problem is that I dont know what is the PAGESLUG. The tests I have run with the url above using the PAGESLUG as anything end up redirecting to the correct URL. However, knowing that Facebook is a very unstable platform, I would like to know it there is any better approach to building this redirect url.p  pstrongEDITstrong the above approach has a problem. The redirect loses the SSL protocol and uses the HTTP link when the facebook user doesnt use SSL by default.p

Negative 2512 pThe building process of the current application Im working on. Currently to build the application a configuration file is assembled based on the environment to be used, a combination of environment type and country, from multiple properties files.p  pTo explain it a bit better, theres a folder hierarchy like thisp  precodeDEFAULT     UK     Malaysia     India PROD     UK     Malaysia     India DEV     UK     Malaysia     India codepre  pWhere in each folder there are properties files, that are merged and overwritten based on the combination selected. So Prod file would overwrite Default file and ProdUK would overwrite DefaultUK, because there are properties specific to each domain and to each countryp  pI think is a quite common scenario for applications, specially websites, where most of the code is common but localized configuration changes some functionalities e.g. payment methods, but I still couldnt find any best practice or building tips for improvingsimplifying the process.

What is not working fine is, when the cancel button gets pressed a NetworkOnMainThreadException is being raised. I am new to Android programming but I am suspecting it has something to do with the ProgressDialog which is in the constructor. Since it is not in the doInBackground part.p  pTried to fix it with implementing the OnDismissListener and doing the abortion onDismiss but still no luck. I am getting the error when mRequest.abort is called.

With enough time, this produces the action with the lowest free energy, and thus the highest reward for the given state.p  pstrongOverview of the large action taskstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQya76.png altenter image description herep  pstrongOverview of the authors guidelines for implementationstrongp  blockquote   pA restricted Boltzmann machine with 13 hidden variables was trained on an instantiation of   the large action task with an 12bit state space and a 40bit action space.

Negative 2512 pI have a bunch of PDFs that Im using as vector art in an app Im writing. Im using the CG Context command CGContextDrawPDFPage to draw the PDFs, and its working great so far. A problem Ive run into is that I would like to be able to modify the color of the vector art at runtime. All of the PDFs currently draw as solid black, as they were designed.p  pIs it possible to draw a PDF but somehow change what color it gets drawn with Maybe modify the color palette so that black maps to something else, or actually change the PDF itself at runtime I realize that PDFs contain color information already in the file, so maybe it would be possible to tell Quartz to ignore those colors and use something elsep  pMore info The PDFs Im drawing are various icons  shapes that the program needs to draw. They are some black shape, with a transparent background. I need to be able to draw that PDF but using a different color, or do as Bill Wilson mentioned and overlay a different color using Blend Modes. I tried kCGBlendModeLighten but the problem is that if I fill a rect around the pdf, the outside transparent areas become red, so there is just a red box instead of a red shape.p  pSo I need a way to map black to color X but leave transparent as is.p  pHere is an example of a PDF that I need to draw in different colors a hrefhttpdavidevansgames.comresFON179.pdf relnofollowhttpdavidevansgames.comresFON179.pdfap

Negative 2512 pI have a distributed system design problem. The problem brief isp  blockquote   pWe have many clients to a service. The service needs to be   faulttolerant and so it will have many replicas. When a client can no   longer access the service it will switch to a replica and inform all   the other clients will switch to the same replica. It is not   acceptable to loadbalance across the replicas as the replicas data   values are not exactly the same but all the clients must return the   same data values at all times.p blockquote  pMy current design is to have the client, on failing to reach the service, ask for a new service leader. When a new service leader is established it will then notify all the clients to use it.p  pAs with many distributed coordination designs I need a distributed group manager. I am considering the use of JGroups andor Apache Zookeeper in a solution.p  pIs there an existing recipe or recipes that I should be looking at to solve this problem p

Negative 2512 pId like to write an interpreter and tracing JIT for a programming language Im designing. I already have many years of experience programming in C, but Ive been wondering if perhaps newer alternatives might be better. One of the things I found most frustrating, back in my C days, was having to use header files to deal with the clunky onepass compiler model. The problem is that not all languages are equally suited for this purpose. For my tracing JIT, I need to be able to write executable code into memory and have the interpreter call to that code. I will also need the generated code to be able to call back into host functions.p  pI started looking at Go and saw that the language had pointers but no pointer arithmetic. This immediately struck me as a huge issue. I may well want to write my own allocator and garbage collector. I will need to closely control the way my language objects are laid out in memory and be able to get the address of specific fields and write to them. Unless theres ways to deal with this, it kind of seems like Go fails to be lowlevel enough for my purposes.p  pThe D language seems promising. It has pointer arithmetic and a clear outline of the ABI needed to call in and out of D. Ive heard lots of good things about it. It also has garbage collection which is nice for compiler writing, but I still have a few things Im not sure aboutp  ol lipDoes D have standard libs that will allow me to mark chunks of memory as executablepli lipIf I allocate a big chunk of memory that I want to manage myself, with my own GC, and have a bunch of pointers going into there, will this pose problems with Ds garbage collectorpli lipHow well does D interoperate with C code, in your experience Is loading C dynamic libraries and calling into them fairly easypli ol  pFinally, theres the whole support aspect. For those who have used D on linux here, how good is the toolchain Any issues Has anyone written a JIT compiler in D, and if so, how was the experiencep

Negative 2512 h1The Backgroundh1  pIm in the process of updating an AIR app that was built with Flex 4.5 and AIR 2.6 to Flex 4.6 and AIR 3.3. Im doing this to take advantage of the native JSON class and to get ready for AIR 3.4 and Actionscript Workers, both things I plan to make use of. Im also using PureMVC 2.0.4.p  pThe actual updating process went fine. I downloaded the Flex 4.6 SDK and overlaid the AIR 3.3 SDK on top of it. So far so good. I was using the JSON class in a hrefhttpsgithub.commikechambersas3corelib relnofollowas3coreliba so I had to make some changes, removing references to that from my app. Aside from that smooth sailing.

Negative 2512 pI need to apply a custom validator to billing address fields.  The view displays several address fields, including a Country dropdown list with U.S. and Canada options, and a BillingPostalCode textbox.  Originally I applied a regular expression to the message contract that allowed either U.S. or Canada zip codes, like sop  precode[MessageBodyMember] [DisplayName  Billing Postal Code] [Required] [StringLength10, MinimumLength  5] [RegularExpressiond5d4[ABCEGHJKLMNPRSTVXY]1d1[AZ]1 d1[AZ]1d1, ErrorMessage  Zip code is invalid.]  US or Canada public string BillingPostalCode     get  return billingPostalCode     set  billingPostalCode  value   codepre  pThe above will allow either U.S. or Canada zip codes.  But, the business owner wants the form to allow a U.S. or Canadian zip code only when United States or Canada is respectively selected in the BillingCountry dropdown list.  In his test case, he selected Canada and entered a U.S. zip code. That scenario should be disallowed.p  pMy initial stab at doing this was to put this in the view, though Im not happy with creating 2 textbox fields.  I should only need 1 field.p  precodeltdiv stylefloat left width 35gt    Zip Codeltbr gt    ltspan idspanBillingZipUSgt       Html.TextBoxForm gt m.BillingPostalCode, new  class  customerinput, id  BillingPostalCode     ltspangt    ltspan idspanBillingZipCanadagt       Html.TextBoxForm gt m.BillingPostalCode, new  class  customerinput, id  BillingPostalCodeCanada     ltspangt    Html.ValidationMessageForm gt m.BillingPostalCode    ltbr gt ltdivgt codepre  pMy thought process being that Ill use jQuery to show or hide the appropriate span when the Country dropdown list is toggled.  That piece is easy.p  pBut Im stuck with the problem that both text boxes have that single validator applied to them, which maps to the MessageBodyMember pasted above.  I know how to write the validation code in jQuery, but would prefer to also have the validation applied to the server side as well.p  pIm fairly new to MVC, having come from web forms.  The old school web forms custom validation was simple to implement.  Examples Ive found online for custom validation in MVC are pretty complex.  At first, this seemed to be a very basic request.  The code needs to evaluate one variable the selected Country and apply the appropriate regular expression for that country to the BillingPostalCode field.p  pHow do I meet this requirement in a straightforward fashion with MVC3  Thanks.p

Negative 2512 pIve posted a similar question previously but got no responses so Ive tried to make it much more specific Ive been able to do this after a LOAD of testing.

In it I have a Test controller containing the following two methodsp  precodepublic ActionResult Test2      return View   public ActionResult Test2Get      System.Threading.Thread.Sleep270000     var x  Author  x     return Jsonx,JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet  codepre  pThe Test2 view is as followsp  precode     ViewBag.Title  Test2   lth2gtTest2lth2gt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction           .ajax             url httpwww.lpweb.netTestTest2Get,             type GET,             success function result  alertsuccess                ltscriptgt codepre  pAs you can see the Test2 View simply executes a callback on load to a method that sleeps for 4.5 minutes then returns some JSON.p  pWhen run locally in VS through the Azure emulator this works fine on all browsers. If I construct a nonAzure version and deploy to a hosted server then this works fine in all browsers. By works I mean the alert with the success message is displayed.p  pHOWEVER, when deployed to Windows Azure this only works if I use Chrome. Otherwise the alert never appears. p  pThere are other tidbits e.g. if the sleep duration is set to 4 minutes or less all browsers work, even when the app is deployed to Azure. But I really dont know what relevance that has.p  pI was hoping someone had an idea where I could look. If anyone wants to try this themselves you can just go to a hrefhttpwww.lpweb.net relnofollowhttpwww.lpweb.neta, click the Test2 action link and wait 4.5 minutes.

Negative 2512 pIm using Eclipse version 4.2, I have the GWT plugin installed, and created a new Web Application Project and enabled GAE and GWT. Im getting an error stating Java compiler level does not match the version of the installed Java project facet. I have the compiler level set to 1.6. My version of eclipse does not seem to have an option to change the facet version in the UI i.e. select project properties, no option on left for facets..., so after some searching I found that the org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.xml file could be edited under my project.settings folder, so I went in and changed version to 1.6 Rebuilt the project, closed and reopened eclipse a billion times, and tried changing every setting and searching for every instance of 1.7 in the project I could to ensure Java 1.6 is being used for everything, yet I still get an error stating the compiler level and installed Java project facet do not match. I have searched and searched, and most posts tend to recommend going to project, properties and selecting project facets on the left. This DOES NOT APPEAR, and I have changed the file in .settings to indicate 1.6 ive closed and reopened several times to confirm this has saved, and rebuilt the project to ensure it knows this has been changed.

For non colliding particle effects, I am thinking about using something like SPARK, since I think thatd give me the best of both worlds. p  pThe issue I am thinking about, is that each block is 16x16, so on a 1600x900 scene, there are about 5 thousand tiles. p  pSo I need to tell the physics engine that these tiles are collidable. Of course, there are void tiles that are considered to be non collidable. p  pDoes anyone have ideas on this Language is C, I doubt thats relevant though. p  pEDIT i think im going to have to cave in and use grid based water. I suppose, in retrospect particle based just makes everything more difficult but for what gainp

I have finished constructing an app of mine for the iPhone platform, and now Im working on the Android version of that app. In Xcode, when the orientation of a UIViewController is switched to landscape, the emulator automatically flips to that orientation when it gets to that part of the app. Not so in Eclipse for Android.

Negative 2512 pIs there a syntax to allow generic type parameters on function literals I know I could wrap it in a method such asp  precodedef createLongStringFunction[T] T gt Boolean     obj T gt obj.toString.length gt 7  codepre  pbut then I end up needing to invoke the method for every type T and getting a new function. I looked through the language reference, and while I see that the function literal syntax is translated by the compiler to an instance of a emFunctionnem object that itself has generic input types, it looks like the compiler magic realizes those parameters at the time of creation. I havent found any syntax that allows me to, in effect, leave one or more of the type parameters of emFunctionnem unbound.

Use the live link above for better visual understanding.p  pstrongBackstorystrong I am have developed an offcanvas mobile menu for my website which uses nothing but CSS with the exception of some jquery class switching.  The navigation is being dynamically generated using PHP.  Initially when I created this nav I had two separate Navigation instances that generated two sets of HTML for the same nav.  One generated using codeltnavgtcode, and one using codeltdiv idnavgtcode.p  pThe codeltnavgtcode set of HTML was styled for the fullwidth desktop version of the navigation.  The codeltdiv idnavgtcode set of HTML was styled for the mobile version of the site using media queries.  Using media queries I simply hid the mobile version at the desktop size, and then in mobile media query hid the desktop version and set nav to codedisplay blockcodep  pThis worked flawlessly with no graphical problems or issues.p  pstrongThe current storystrongp  pNow, I have consolidated the two separate navigations into a more resilient PHP structure.  That said, it is much easier and more efficient to use one set of HTML and style it differently for mobile etc.p  pI duplicated the site and painstakingly changed the mobile classes to the relative codenav gt ul gt li gt ulcode selectors. no longer using ID of nav since I have one set of HTML I have to make desktop and mobile work for one set of HTML.p  pFor some reason now when loading the site on any mobile device even a desktop browser shrunk to mobile size, when you load a page, you can see the navigation links load on page then disappear, hence the flash.p  pI have tried setting the entire nav to codedisplay nonecode at the top of my styles for media query then codedisplay blockcode at the bottom of the media query styles thinking I could hide the nav until it styled it and moved it off canvas then after that point set it to block so as to make it reappear even tho it would be offscreen.  But to no avail... This does not work.p  pstrongI am looking for a fix for this flash and I dont particularly care how its done as long as it is not reverting back to my previous structure using two separate sets of HTML.strongp  pNote that the CSS below does reference the ID nav.  This is accurate, I did not remove the ID, I just did not use it to style the bulk of the nav.  The nav HTML structure is standard for a sub menu nav.

Negative 2512 pI am trying to extract from a series of strings which represents depth likep  precodefoobarx foobarbazx foobarbazx foobarlolx codepre  pWhere codexcode is a number I dont care about. Ive got as far as splitting on the codecode and looping through, at which point in PHP Id do something like check where in the loop I am using codefor i0 etccode and then use that to determine my depth to build an output array likep  precodeoutput[foo][bar]  1 output[foo][bar][baz]  2 output[foo][bar][lol]  1 codepre  pThe trouble is the depth is dynamic and might be either just 34 deep which I could just account for with lots of checks on the value of codeicode and handling them separately or say 10 or more deep in which case some kind of recursive function is probably best.p  pIve come across the issue that to have a string as an array index I need to use a dictionary, but you have to specify the types in the dictionary, meaning you need to know the depth in advanced correct me if Im wrong when instantiating a dictionary object.p  pI guess an attack might be something like calling a recursive function such that each time its called you pass codeicode to indicate the depth, then the function calls itself decrementing codeicode each time until it has built the portion of the tree from that input string but its what storage structures I use for that in C that I am not sure about.p  pThe final output will be a CSV that I can open as a spreadsheet to look likep  precodeFoo        0 Bar     1    Baz  2    Lol  1 codepre  pPerhaps one direction for a solution is to use a pure C Array and simply store the title e.g. codefoocode in there, keeping information out of array indicies, which is probably best practice anyway.

The value for this key is a QJsonArray of QJsonObjects that contain a number of keyvalue pairs that contain my data.p  pIf I wanted to retrieve the QJsonObject with id clk I am currently using code like thisp  precode imagine mdata is my parent QJsonObject QJsonArray clocks  mdata[CLOCKS].toArray foreach const QJsonValue amp value, clocks      QJsonObject obj  value.toObject     if obj[ID].toString  clk          return obj       codepre  pThis works fine and the library has been great so far. However, I have started running into issues recently when I want to obtain a QJsonObject strongreferencestrong for modification instead of a copy.p  pSo my question is, given the sample data provided how do I obtain a QJsonObject reference in order to modify the keyvalue pairs in the desired clock data object. The problem manifests itself, IMO due to the fact that you can obtain QJsonValueRefs, which are references to the value entries... but to actually access the data inside this if the value is another arrayobject you must convert using the toArray, toObject functions etc. This functions only return copies and not references creating a barrier to iterating down the object hierarchy with references.p  pThe only way I have come up with so far to get around this is to create a copy of the entire CLOCKS QJsonArray, find the object I want then delete it and reinsert it with the changed data... and finally assign the entire array back to the CLOCKS key in the parent object. This seems cumbersome enough to me to me that I feel like I am doing something wrong and there must be a better way.p  pTo support this here is what my code looks like so far... just to change the VALUE for one of the clock QJsonObjectsp  precode  QJsonArray resets  mdata.valueTAGRESETS.toArray     get a copy of the QJsonObject   QJsonObject obj   foreach const QJsonValue amp value, resets      QJsonObject o  value.toObject     if o.valueTAGID.toString  id        obj  o       break             modify the object   obj[TAGVALUE]  NEW VALUE     erase the old instance of the object   for auto it  resets.begin it  resets.end it      QJsonObject obj  it.toObject     if obj.valueTAGID.toString  id        resets.eraseit         assign the array copy which has the object deleted       mdata[TAGRESETS]  resets       break                add the modified QJsonObject   resets.appendobj     replace the original array with the array containing our modified object   mdata[TAGRESETS]  resets codepre  pI know this could be shortened a little bit but it still seems like there must be a better way to change a single value in a QJson object hierarchy without going to all this effortp

Negative 2512 pWhile working with refqualified function overloads, Im getting different results from emGCC 4.8.1em and emClang 2.9 and trunkem. Consider the following codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltutilitygt  struct foo      intamp bar amp              stdcout ltlt nonconst lvalue ltlt stdendl         return bar           intampamp bar ampamp                stdcout ltlt nonconst rvalue ltlt stdendl          return stdmovebar           int constamp bar const amp              stdcout ltlt const lvalue ltlt stdendl         return bar          int constampamp bar const ampamp              stdcout ltlt const rvalue ltlt stdendl         return stdmovebar           int bar   int mainint argc, char argv      foo.bar  codepre  pemClangem compiles it and outputs codeconst rvaluecode, while emGCCem thinks this is an ambiguous call with the two constqualified functions both being best viable candidates. If I provide all 4 overloads, then both compilers output codenonconst rvaluecode.p  pI would like to know which compiler emif anyem is doing the right thing, and what are the relevant standard pieces in play.p  pemstrongNotestrongem The reason this actually matters is that the real code declares both constqualified functions as codeconstexprcode. Of course, there is no output to codestdcoutcode and codestaticcastcode is used instead of codestdmovecode, so that they are valid codeconstexprcode definitions. And since in emC11em codeconstexprcode still implies codeconstcode, the overload commented out in the sample code cannot be provided as it would redefine the constqualified rvalue overload.p

Negative 2512 pI have a shared resource with high initialisation cost and thus I want to access it across the system its used for some instrumentation basically, so has to be light weight.

I then use functions of this module across the system to operate on the resource. br  Now I am wondering whether or how often I will have to reinitialise the resource br  I know objects are garbage collected in CPython on or better around zero reference count, but is storing in an module counted as a reference, even if the module is not being executed at the momentp  pExample with code here we have the module, where connect is slow.

Negative 2512 pLong time lurker, first time questioner here  p  pI have been looking into our companys next software system architecture. We have been using CSLA.net, to some extent, as our business object framework and are thinking of building our new architecture around it. CSLA.net has support for the platforms mentioned in the title and we are looking for mvvm framework that would work well with it. p  pAt the moment we only support windows environments but are also looking to support at least Android and iOS also mono in general is under consideration. We are looking to share as much of the code as possible between the platforms and MvvmCross seems like really nice piece of mvvm  framework, especially in that context. I have watched few n1 videos and what I have seen so far has been very impressive. I also like the Stuarts style of introducing the framework and concepts around it. p  pHas anyone tried to build a cross platform application that uses both of these frameworks CSLA.net and MvvmCross If yes, what have been your experiences like Also if Stuart could comment on the issue of how to merg the viewmodels of the two frameworks. I remember Rocky Rockford Lhotka recommending, as a general tip when working with mvvm frameworks, to inherit CSLA.net viewmodelbasenot viewmodel and implement also mvvm frameworks requirements into that class. You can find source of the viewmodelbase from a hrefhttpsgithub.comMarimerLLCcslablobmasterSourceCsla.XamlViewModelBase.cs relnofollowhttpsgithub.comMarimerLLCcslablobmasterSourceCsla.XamlViewModelBase.csa. p  pAny input would be much appreciated.p  pRegards,p  pHarrip  pps.

We do want to get all braches to the companyrepository, which is already happening but I do want to be able to limit what goes to public to github, so not all branches will go public.p  pThe problem is that now everything goes to github, probably due to the mirror option.

Negative 2512 pLets say that you have a navigation view controller hierarchy like thisp  precodeA gt B gt C codepre  pThe user spends most of their time in codeBcode, hopping over to codeCcode only when its their turn to supply input.p  pIf their turn comes up while the app is backgrounded, they get a local notification. Tapping on that local notification emshouldem take them straight to codeCcode.p  pIn my current implementation, when the user taps on the local notification, the codeAppDelegatecode receives it via codeapplicationdidReceiveLocalNotificationcode. It then finds codeBcode and instructs it to segue to codeCcode.p  pIf the app has been unloaded, however, this wont work. When the user eventually acts upon the local notification, the app receives it through codeapplicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode, meaning that it has to start all the way back at codeAcode.p  pSince this problem generalizes to one about deep linking to a particular state of an app, my question isp  pstrongWhats your best strategy for deep linking to codeA gt B gt Ccode in response to a local notification having been acted upon, given that the current state of the app could be anythingstrongp

Negative 2512 pI have an app in C WPF with an existing code.rdlccode file added to a codeReportViewercode. The report already has datasets. Here is a printscreen a hrefhttps8.postimg.org3nahbg285report.jpg relnofollowlinka. Now, I have a codeDataGridcode thats bound to an codeObservableCollectioncode. How can I pass data from the collection to the fields of the dataset The parts of the items of the codeObservableCollectioncode have the same type as the fields of the datasets but have different names. So I want the user to be able to select a single row from the codeDataGridcode and the records of this row parts of an item of the codeObservableCollectioncode to fill the appropriate fields of the dataset thus showing a populated report in my codeReportViewercode. And whenever the user selects a different row, the data in the report should change accordingly. I hope Ive been clear. Ive read about codeIEnumerablecode and codeListltTgtcode set as datasource but I dont get that. I just want to overwrite the fields of my dataset as if they were parts of a structure or a class and then present them in the formatted report. Can this be done in a similar, simple way Because I dont know why I would want to take my item from the codeObservableCollectioncode and make a codeListltgtcode out of it. But in case I chose this option should the items of the codeListltgtcode have the same name and type as the fields in the datasetp  pThank you for your answer in advancep
Negative 2512 pIm adding a Navigation Drawer to this app that I am developing and I have scoured the internet forums, stackoverflow, android developer documentation, and still have not found a great answer for this. p  pI know that it is possible to do this without using either of these things. What I am wondering is how. The NsMenuAdapter model uses a title, and then there are these functions p  precodegetActionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue getActionBar.setHomeButtonEnabledtrue codepre  pWhich are clearly looking for an action bar. I tried a couple of models that didnt work, the big one I just got done trying is located here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16874826howtoaddiconsadjacenttotitlesforandroidnavigationdrawerHow to Add icons adjacent to titles for Android Navigation Drawera which is related to the link I have below, the project is from gitHub here a hrefhttpsgithub.comgabrielemariottiandroiddevtreemasterNavigationDrawer relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgabrielemariottiandroiddevtreemasterNavigationDrawera. Now the key thing is, I am using a custom layout i.e. Relative Layouts mixed in with Linear Layouts and Im really lost on what my next step should be in order to get this to work. p  pSidenote When I only have the ListView in my mainactivity.xml the implementation for the Navigation Drawer it does properly slide out like it is suppose to. But I cannot for the life of me figure out how to populate it with data. I basically need 3 headers with that will have clickable navigation elements in them, with icons next to the elements. p  pI turned to this model for most of my insight on how to do this via Relative Layouts a hrefhttpgmariotti.blogspot.com201305creatingnavigationdrawer.html relnofollowhttpgmariotti.blogspot.com201305creatingnavigationdrawer.htmla But they use actiontitle bars which is what is really throwing me for a loop. p

Negative 2512 pIve come across a very strange feature of the ListView. Hopefully someone can help me out here.p  pWhen you create a ListView on your Window, it comes with a default spacing between the border and the content. I guess its a padding of 2 left and right if you look at the Snoop information. The ListBoxChrome part of the ListView is in my case 363px wide. The ScrollViewer inside it is 359px. Theres nothing set on both these controls. Even a new project with a simple ListView has this issue.p  pOne workaround is to give the header cells a padding of 2, but for some reason the headers wont fill until the right and leaves me with a wider gap at the right.p  pSomeone here to help me outp  pSome screenshotsp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comAKbDfwQ.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comAKbDfwQ.pngap  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.compQtqMJ4.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.compQtqMJ4.pngap

Negative 2512 pIm implementing kind of a rich text editor based on HTML5 contenteditable features and now stuck on the following obstacle.

And if the actually changed text is moved, the focus and cursor should be moved too.p  pHow this could be possibly achieved The only idea I have now that partially solves the issue at least rendering is to render the complete piece of text in a separate hidden area and then use linked fields dimensions to detect pieces of text to be shown in each area.p  pThe solution is built on top of Backbone  Marionette  Lodash  jQuery.p

Negative 2512 pI have a database which has over 50 items in it which need to be checked and possibly edited. I have a web page which pulls the data from the database using php and displays it as values in a webform.

For example, in a textarea, the value of the textarea will display the current content of the database item. The user can then edit the content.

Negative 2512 pIm coding iOS 6.1 and learning how to use Core Data.p  pThe documentation for fetchedObjects saysp  pThe results array reflects the inmemory state of managed objects in the controllers    managed object context, not their state in the persistent store. The returned array does not, however, update as managed objects are inserted, modified, or deleted.p  pThat last sentence bears on what Im seeing. p  pI.e., I fetch the data from an entity, I do a count of the fetched objects fetchedObjects.count and I get what I expect.  p  pThen I create a new object and I save it and then I do the fetchedObjects.count again and get the same result as last time  not bumped up by one as Id expected.p  pSo, my problem was how to get the fetchedObjects to update after Id saved my context.p  pI read about using the NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13391934coredatansfetchedresultscontrollerfetchedobjectswillthismethodreflecrq1herea and tried out some of what was suggested which was that I use a delegate.p  pI assigned myself as the delegate.p  precode frc.delegate  self codepre  pI added the delegate like sop  precodeinterface DB  NSObject ltNSFetchedResultsControllerDelegategt codepre  pAnd I implemented the delegate call back like sop  precode void controllerDidChangeContent NSFetchedResultsController  controller                codepre  pAnd it all worked.   But I dont understand why.p  pIf I remove the three bits of delegate code, above, my code fails when I create a new object, save my context and then do the fetchedObjects.count.  It fails by the count coming up one short.p  pIf I add back the NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate and the frc.delegate  self bits and leave out the call back routine, it still fails.p  pOnly if I also add the callback routine back in which does nothing functional, by the way, does my code succeed.p  pThis makes me a bit paranoid  as in wondering why it works if the callback does nothing and if this will work 99 of the time and then fail once in a blue moonp  pSo, I created a boolean and I set it in the callback routine so my code will not perform the  postsave count until its seen the boolean flip.  But, Im thinking this might be redundant  and maybe even silly.p  precodeoldCount  frc.fetchedObjects.count ltcreate a new object heregt frcDelegateCalled  FALSE    [self saveDB]    [frc.managedObjectContext processPendingChanges]    while  frcDelegateCalled  FALSE     newCount  frc.fetchedObjects.count codepre  pandp  precode void controllerDidChangeContent NSFetchedResultsController  controller        frcDelegateCalled  TRUE     codepre  pSo, the processPendingChanges call apparently hurries the update along and my boolean makes sure that the callback has been called indicating that the fetchedObjects has been updated before I recount.p  pIm a bit confused as to why the code works simply because a callback is present.

Then additionally, further down in index3, there is another php..p  precodeltdiv styleposition absolute left 30px top 533px width 100px height 26pxgt ltdiv stylewidth 100px  height  26pxgt ltphp include usernameget.php gt ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pusernameget.php refuses to display, UNLESS I get rid of opwire, as if xara only wants to handle 1 php inclusion.  p  pSo, to fix the warnings, Ive been given 3 options in the previous questionp  precode1. Have separate files. You would have a file like pagestart.php that does includes and sessionstart that you include at the very top of index3.php, and a file like displaytable.php that displays your table that you include where the table goes.  2. Turn the table into a function. You would wrap the table output inside a function, include getopwire.php at the very top of index3.php, then call the function down where you want the table.  3. Use output buffering. Output buffering catches the stuff printed out so that you can use it later. It would go like this codepre  pI have experimented with all three of these for a day now especially option 3, but Im just to new to php to put it together. Id also like to logically understand why the second php include fails and to know what my actual best option is. Help would be very much appreciatedp  pEdit Errorsp  precode[08Oct2013 113609] PHP Warning  sessionstart [lta hreffunction.sessionstartgtfunction.sessionstartltagt] Cannot send session cache limiter  headers already sent output started at home2mysitepublichtmlmysubsiteindex3.php7 in home2mysitepublichtmlmysubsitefunctions.php on line 12  [08Oct2013 113609] PHP Warning  sessionregenerateid [lta hreffunction.sessionregenerateidgtfunction.sessionregenerateidltagt] Cannot regenerate session id  headers already sent in home2mysitepublichtmlmysubsitefunctions.php on line 13 codepre

Negative 2512 pIm developping a Rails4 application with heroku hosting, and i encounter a bit of a problem I have a helper method to randomly pick an image by its path in codeassetsimagespathtoimagecode and this helper method is called in my HAML file. It works perfectly in my local environment. The images urls are stored in the DB. The problem is that Heroku changes the image names from codelogo.jpgcode to codelogoa6d14b20c77aa6466e616313edcd3d34.jpgcode which makes my helper method useless. Any idea on how i could solve this problem Is it a matter of precompiling the assets  Thanks a lot B.p

Once it arrives at element 6 however and elements 5 and 6 in the internal array, its printing the recurstion message.p  pI handle array recursion by adding an element with a very specific key to each array being logged.  If that key is later found in an array, it means that the array has already been converted to a string and it should be skipped.p  pI did some testing using normal printr.  When I add the key, it immediately shows up in a printr of the array makes sense.  I then iterate over each array element however and recursively call printr on it.  When the array comes to itself element 5, printr shows that the marker element doesnt exist.p  pIt seems on the one hand like a value vs reference thing  like Im forgetting to add an amp somewhere.  But the key does show up when element 6 comes around, as well as in both 5 and 6 of the recursive processing of the array.p  pMy other thought was that something internal to the array needed to be reset before a reference would recognize the existence of the marker key.  I tried reset to no avail.  Does anyone have any insight as to why this is acting this wayp  pThanks  Natep  pSourcep  precode   Alternative to printr that makes use of ANSIColor.

Negative 2512 pSince this is complicated Ill give an example of what Im trying to attemptp  pIn the first table, strongUser Datastrong, I have stronguserstrongs and their saved game files strongsavefilestrongs.  Each user can be associated with multiple saved game files. The second table is strongScoresstrong of all the saved game files on the server.  It has a row for each strongsavefilestrong, and also a strongtimestampstrong of when the game was saved, the strongscorestrong at that point, and the strongtitlestrong of the game.p  pNow say I want to reset to a zero score all users most recent files for each game title.  This means I need to codeUPDATE Scores SET score0 WHERE userx AND titley AND timestamp  SELECT maxtimestamp FROM Scores where userx and titleycode.p  pHowever, Im unsure of how to do this with stronguserstrong not being directly in the strongScoresstrong table.  Since the strongUser Datastrong and strongScoresstrong tables are joined by a unique strongsavefilestrong, though, I know there should be a way to do this.  Also, if anybody could recommend to me the best way to handle this iteration so that the statement executes for ALL stronguserstrong, strongtitlestrong pairs, that would be helpfulp  pLogistics  using SQL and Python via mysqldb.p  pThanksp

Negative 2512 pIve inherited an application which sends emails using Apache Camel and ActiveMQ, integrated with Velocity email templates.  The ProducerTemplate.sendBodyAndHeaders method is called to send a message body and headers to a Queue endpoint.  The Camel context XML file defines a route that first sends the message to a Velocity template file, then sends the result thereof to a previouslydefined mail server and off goes the email.p  pAs I acquaint myself with the application, it seems that things are set up not very differently from these examplesp  pa hrefhttpcamel.apache.orgvelocity.html relnofollowhttpcamel.apache.orgvelocity.htmla a hrefhttpcamel.apache.orgtutorialexamplereportincidentpart2.html relnofollowhttpcamel.apache.orgtutorialexamplereportincidentpart2.htmlap  pThe problem is that these examples and the current uses in my application all have the template accessing only simple string values.  The body passed to ProducerTemplate.sendBodyAndHeaders is a string whose value is accessed in the template as body.  The headers passed to ProducerTemplate.sendBodyAndHeaders are in the form of a Map of string keys to string values, with those values accessed in the template as headers.keyName1, headers.keyName2, etc.  p  pAll well and good, but now I would like to have my header keys map not to strings, but to emlistsem of strings.  Preferably, it would actually be a list of POJOs, though I could get by if it were a list of strings.  So, in other words, the exact number of strings sent to the template with a given header key could vary from one invocation to the next, and the template would iterate over the list to construct the email as is appropriate for however many came in the list.p  pI see in the VTL documentation how to write a template that could process a list in that way  if I could get such a list passed to the template.  But how do I get it there  I tried just putting a Java ArrayList into the Map, rather than a String, but that doesnt seem to work.  When I try to access headers.list it just gives me the literal string headers.list.  So whats the correct way to do thisp

Negative 2512 pI am trying to program a cough button in a communications program that does not always have focus. I have the code working to mute and unmute the mic MMDevApi and it works perfect. I set up a global hot key and this works perfect to set the mute. Now the problem. How do I tell when the Hotkey is released  I tried a timer as shown in the code but it has an odd behavior. I Hold down my hotkey and the mic mutes immediately then after the interval of the timer it unmutes for a what appears to be half the interval of the timer and then it mutes and stays muted. Without the timer it mutes and stays muted perfectly. I really dont want  or think it would be any good  to have to hit a second key to unmute the mic. p  precodehere is my register hot key code   CoughKeyWnd  AllocateHwndCoughKeyWndProc CoughKey  GlobalAddAtomCoughKey   if CoughKey ltgt 0 then     RegisterHotKeyCoughKeyWnd, CoughKey, MODCONTROL, VKOEM3  the procedure procedure TForm1.CoughKeyWndProcvar Message TMessage begin  if Message.Msg  WMHOTKEY then   begin  to prevent recalling mute      if CoughOn  FALSE then  begin    CoughOn  True    CoughOff.SetMute1,GUIDNULL  end   Timer1.Enabled  FALSE   Timer1.Enabled  True end    else     begin       Message.Result  DefWindowProcCoughKeyWnd, Message.Msg, Message.WParam, Message.LParam     end  and finally the ontimer   procedure TForm1.JvTimer1TimerSender TObject begin   CoughOff.SetMute0,GUIDNULL   Timer1.Enabled  False   CoughOn  False  end codepre

Negative 2512 pI am trying to get several line charts in one container and allow drill down in each of the line graphs. But I am not even able to plot the different line graphs at level 0. The data of the second line graph replaces the first one instead of plotting two graphs.

Negative 2512 pIm still relatively new to Objective C and easily confused by the various types.  I am using code from the SquareCam sample project, incorporated into a larger project. It works fine, but now I want to save the videoDataOutputQueue, which is of type dispatchqueuet so that I can use it elsewhere in the project.  It has to pass through some C code before finally ending up back in Objective C code.  Therefore I am trying to add it to a structure that I already have, as a void  void videoDataOutputQueuep  pHowever, I have not found the right way to assign it without getting a EXCBADACCESS runtime error.  Since dispatchqueuet is a C object, cant I just use its addressp  precode   declared in the interface for squarecamviewcontroller    interface SquareCamViewController  UIViewController ltUIGestureRecognizerDelegate, AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate,UIActionSheetDelegategt     AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer previewLayer    AVCaptureVideoDataOutput dataOutput    AVCaptureVideoDataOutput videoDataOutput    dispatchqueuet videoDataOutputQueue    ltother stuffgt  codepre  plater in the codep  precode voidsetupAVCapture     ltother stuff from the sample codegt     MYSTRUCT  myStruct  MYSTRUCTstruct   make a pointer to the structure     myStructgtvideoDataOutputQueue  void videoDataOutputQueue  ltltlt bad access here at runtime   ltother stuffgt  codepre  pClearly this is not the right way and I dont understand what I am doing.

Negative 2512 pIve just started learning erlang and Tail recursion is killing me slowly I cant get my head around it. Im trying to make a program that doubles every other number in a list and Im trying to do this with tail recursion.p  pHeres my code so far p  precode    stripAndDoubleOdds[HT] gt stripAndDoubleOdds[HT],1,[HT].      stripAndDoubleOddsF, , [] gt F      stripAndDoubleOdds,Index,[H1T1] gt      F  []  2listsnthIndex, [H1T1],    stripAndDoubleOddsF, Index 2, T1. codepre  pWhen I give it a list of numbers I get no output at all but if I give it a single number it can double it without a problem.p  pIndex is meant to keep the position of the current element and its incremented by 2 so that I get every other integer and double it. My current solution involves extracting the head, doubling it, adding it to a list then passing the tail through the process over and over again until I get an empty list and at this point Im supposed to get my list, F back. e.g. if I enter [1,2,3,4,5] I just want it to give me a list with [2,6,,10].p

All that appears is the Please press any key to continue...p  pIm starting to think that my configuration of VSE is corrupted, that maybe I need to uninstall, reboot, and reinstall it all, but Im hoping thats not the case.

My specs are pretty normal, XPS 15z runofthemill laptop running Windows 7, handled VSE perfectly fine for several months until now.p  pSince VSE started to act up I have been operating through the command line, although Im really starting to miss an IDE for C, it just isnt the same.  If VSE doesnt start looking up, Ill just have to get a plugin for Eclipse or actually put in the time to learn how to use Emacs maybe this is a sign haha.p  pIm sorry for the rant.  Has anyone experienced problems like this  The problem isnt that my program is running too quickly at least I dont think, since prompting for user input doesnt work, nor does the dreaded codesystempausecode.p  pAny help will be greatly, greatly appreciated.

Something like thisp  precode      String input  JOptionPane.showInputDialogHow many Employees are we            entering into the system       int numEmployees  Integer.parseIntinput      for int count  1 count lt numEmployees count           Employee employeecount  new Employee      codepre  pI know this code doesnt work but I hope it makes clear that what I am trying to do is each iteration of the loop create a new object employee1, employee2....employeeN and then have some code that will allow the user to enter the needed data.I already have all the necessary accessor and mutator methods. The object would remain in memory after the loop is finished running. Any ideas Thanks everyonep

Negative 2512 pI have GA on every page on one domain actually not me, but my company, whose programmer needs auditing. Just the default code Classic version, ga.js, no special accommodations whatsoever that Ive seen or know of. Bare minimal if any configuration past registering the service with the main site... p  pAll the pages are either aspx or static HTML. Its common practice for this guy to embed pages on the site within other pages on the site in iframes, where both the parent toplevel amp child embedded pages contain the GA script.p  pI dont really know much at all about GA, have never worked with it, but I do suspect that might result in extra hits being counted by GA or something, that that may be messing with the metrics. But then Ive read stuff about GA using firstparty cookies so by default pages loaded in iframes wont be trackedcounted... I could really use some clarification on this, please.p  pThen our programmer frames pages from the main site in pages on other sites that we own, that are on different domains. So then theres this crossdomain business, with no segregation of sources, because they really dont care much. So what should be the outcome of that The external sites pages dont have the GA code.p  pHowever, were rebuilding one of those other sites  actually I am, for the most part  and the programmer told me to just copy and paste the same exact GA script used on the main site into that one. So, its a different domain. That wouldnt work asis, would it Wouldnt there have to be some sort of special configuration, setting of the domain, somethingp  pId really appreciate if someone could tell me more about the scenarios described above. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 2512 pI read up on behaviours and thought it might suit my simple requirements but i dont know how to get started in terms of creating a custom behaviour.p  pScenario  I have a emmasterem table called strongCompaniesstrong. This table has a hasMany relationship to emdetail tablesem strongBusinessDescriptionsstrong and strongAddressesstrong. Of course, these detail tables are linked to the Companies table by a strongforeign keystrong.p  pDespite the hasMany relationship, strongonly one record in these detail tables can be valid on any particular day.strong Hence in the emdetail tablesem for BusinessDescriptions and Addresses, I have fields strongStartdatestrong and strongEnddatestrong which tell you what time period the records are valid for.p  pExample use Company X will have a new address from 01.01.2015. Hence when inserting the new address, its old address record which is valid from Startdate 01.01.2014 to Enddate 31.12.9999, needs to have its Enddate changed to 31.12.2014, to make way for the new record that starts from 01.01.2015.p  pAll this autodelimitationadjustment of startend dates of existing records, I wish to put into a behaviour, however tutorials on getting a custom behavior up and running are hard to find.p  pCan anyone point out to me how to start, or maybe show me skeletal structure of creating a behaviour for thisp

Negative 2512 pI recently set up a Mavericks Server with Xcode Continuous Integration. I created a bot and the bot itself works well running tests and archiving from a remote git server by polling.p  pMy problem is that when I use the web view to view logs the page does not refresh automatically. As an example if I open the server while a integration test is running or if I start integration tests manually from the web view the information just show the spinning wheel like it keeps running, and I have to refresh the page manually to get updated information.p  pThe same happens when I use the Big Screen mode that cycles through the bots showing various information. The views never refresh. I thought that was the whole point with Big Screen to have a screen that always show updated information.p  pI have tried with several different browsers on different machines, and restarted the Xcode service on the server and restarted the server itself with no change. I also tried creating a test project that uses a git repository stored locally on the OS X Server.p  pHas anyone had similar issues Does this work at all Ive tried googling but cant find anything.p

Then it continues where it left off at the bottom.p  pThird, after every codeUpdateStatuscode call after the first irregular one, a number is added, e.g. 90 or 8f or 120 or 14b or 23a. At first I thought it was hex numbers, but then I found the 3 digit ones, and theres a 4 digit one, too  maybe some kind of checksum...p  pExamplep  precode6d ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     UpdateStatusReading client 801 of 1189..., , 0015,  ltscriptgt codepre  pAnd fourth, the server header is also displayed in plain text...p  pSo to be clear The output that is actually on screen starts like thisp  precode8f ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     UpdateStatusReading transaction 9601 of 16263..., , 0003,  ltscriptgt HTTP1.1 200 OK Date Tue, 25 Mar 2014 181642 GMT Server Apache2.2.17 LinuxSUSE XPoweredBy PHP5.3.5 Expires Thu, 19 Nov 1981 085200 GMT CacheControl nostore, nocache, mustrevalidate, postcheck0, precheck0 Pragma nocache KeepAlive timeout15, max72 Connection KeepAlive TransferEncoding chunked ContentType texthtml  5deb lthtmlgtltheadgtlttitlegtLine Processinglttitlegt codepre  pThen we have normal output of the rest of the header and then all the normal JavaScript lines until we reach output codeReading transaction 9501 of 12264code. Then the next line is missing i.e. moved to the top of the page, and then it continues with code9701code and starts adding the numbers at the beginning or end of the code.p  pSo not only does it render all HTML code plus the http headers as text and adds numbers, it also added that line at the top of the output as opposed to in between which is probably the biggest mystery to me since I am sending every bit of information to the screen immediately using codeechocode.p  pMy script completes successfully, sends the HTML closing tags and stuff with one last number code0code added, done.p  pThis happens on Firefox on Windows XP  I dont have more information on this yet, but I do know that this version of Firefox has a menu which by default is now turned off and does NOT have any of the new menu buttons the orange Firefox button or the three line button, so maybe its just an outdated version of Firefox. However, on the same browser, most of the time the script works just fine. Its just under very mysterious circumstances that this issue occurs.p  pThe web server is either at the client location or somewhere nearby and connected through a VPN connection  I dont have that information at this time. But still, most of the time, the script works fine, and I havent figured out yet when it does this.p  pFrankly, I dont even know where to start here...p  pI am guessing it could be a virus or a malicious Firefox extension, and Ill pass this on to the client to check into, but what else could this bep  pIf it was a PHP error, I wouldnt expect it to send a 23 digit code on screen...p  pThoughtsp

If I remove that line and run the codeforcode loop that follows, none of the codecardPanelcode methods work anymore. If I invoke coderemoveAllcode after the for loop nothing happens, and if I try adding, nothing happens, at least not visually.

Negative 2512 pIm starting my adventure with NodeJS. Ive choose express web framework with mongoose database.

This one is magic, I have completly no idea why this is happening Those records above v and id, are not being save anywhere show collections, and find on each of those results in null. But when I run  p  precodeUser.findfunctionerr, users    if err     res.senderr   res.jsonusers codepre  pI get few records previous tries of passing this form with its v and id. p  pConnection looks like thisp  precodevar mongoose  requiremongoose  mongoose.connectmongodblocalhost1test codepre  pThanks for any tips, explanation to that.

However, as soon as I opened source code of the example script, I found out that there are no explanatory comments at all.p  pI started googling and found a a hrefhttpwww.html5rocks.comentutorialswebaudiointro relnofollowlong and interesting article about AudioContexta  that doesnt to be aware of the recording at all it only mentions remixinf sounds and a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPIAudioContext relnofollowMDN articlea, that contains all the information  succesfully hiding the one Im after.p  pIm also aware of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq14418530607407existing frameworksa that deal with the thing somehow, maybe. But if I wanted to have a sound recorder Id download one  but Im really curious how the thing works.p  pNow not only that Im not familiar with the coding part of the thing, Im also curious how the whole thing will work  do I get intensity in specific time Much like in any osciloscope Or can I already get spectral analysis for the samplep  pSo, just to avoid any mistakes Please, could anyone explain the simplest and most straightforward way to get the input data using abovementioned API and eventually provide a code with explanatory commentsp

Negative 2512 pI have been struggling with this problem now for over a week, and would really appreciate some help. I am developing my first Java game using a gui, and I currently have about 20 classes involved. The game is a simple gridbased representation of Star Trek, with JLabel icons that move around the galaxy grid. The problem is that usually after about 7 to 10 moves, one of two things will happen one, the grid of sectors in my current quadrant will disappear, leaving only a single sector in the top left corner or two, the Enterprise icon will disappear.p  pI have no experience dealing with threads, but after some reading I thought this was probably a result of the Event Dispatch Thread not being properly synchronized with the program logic. I read up on the proper way to update a GUI, and surrounded all my statements that had any effect on the GUI I think with invokeLater and invokeAndWait blocks.p  pHowever, this did not solve the problem. So, today I rewrote everything into the smallest compilable unit I could it isnt that small, but I cant figure out how to make it smaller while still keeping my basic game structure to see if that would change anything. It didnt. The GUI still gets corrupted after 7 to 10 moves.p  pI am at my wits end here. I would be truly grateful for some help.p  pHere is my code. It compiles and runs as is.p  precodeimport java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.Font import java.awt.Toolkit import java.awt.event.WindowAdapter

Negative 2512 pWe are creating a complex formsbased application for entering business data on an Android tablet. The minimum available space will be round 400x500dp, but could easily be larger. A typical 7 tablet is around 600x960dp. We expect to have at least 15 fields on a form, but could be 20 or more.p  pThe design consists mainly of textual labels and fields, with some buttons and the odd image. It places a high priority on vertical alignment of elements and meaningful grouping of fields.p  pThe problem is what kind of Layout to choose. In summaryp  ul liRelativeLayout allows precise location of View elements, at the cost of being tied to a specific size of screen, because the elements are placed at the dp level.li liGridLayout might improve on this by allowing elements to be placed at the grid cell level, and those cells could be resized from one screen size to another.li liTableLayout corresponds to a similar concept in HTML, which is used successfully for web forms, but depends to produce rather fluid results.li ul  pWe rejected simply LinearLayouts because of insufficient control over positioning and vertical alignment, and the need for complex nested layouts.p  pI could post some XML code, but I doubt it would help. Currently we have RelativeLayout and lots of widgets at fixed offsets, and thats all it would show.

Negative 2512 pWere doing some server maintenance for a client of ours. One of the tasks was to change all server passwords user account  mysql accounts.

Negative 2512 pI found a really good walk through of how to pass string values back from a ViewController to a calling ViewController and got it working perfectly.  The example is really very good.p  pa hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvYVikeoR3gYg relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvYVikeoR3gYgap  pThat said, the technique for passing back content seems relatively straight forward now that I have seen it, even if its not that intuitive.p  pThe example code however only includes two controllers.  When I replicated the code using a much more detailed Storyboard, the code simply doesnt work.  In my test app, I even embedded the calling Controller inside a NavigationController to see whether this would have an affect, but it still continued to work fine.p  pIn my application, the ViewController is embedded within a NavigationController that is called via a SWRevealController segue class.  I dont know if this is important or relevant but I am mentioning it.p  pI then call a CollectionViewController to choose an icon that should be passed back to the calling ViewController.p  pWhen I select the icon, I correctly identify the icon and popp  precode voidcollectionViewUICollectionView collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      selectedIcon  [placeIcons objectAtIndexindexPath.row]     NSLogIn IconCollectionViewControlled  selected , selectedIcon      NSString itemToPassBack  12345       Just testing any old string here...   [self.delegate passBackIconselectedIcon]  commenting out while testing      [self.delegate passBackIconitemToPassBack]     [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimatedYES]  codepre  pI get a correct trace suggesting that the right icon is selected.  I would then expect that the text 12345 would be passed back to the calling Controller.p  pIn my calling Controller, I have the followingp  precode voidpassBackIconNSString iconName      NSLogIcon to use is , iconName  codepre  pBut this just isnt being called at all or at least Im not seeing the NSLog being shown.  Its just being ignored.p  pThe delegate is being correctly declared as far as I can tell.p  pAm I missing somethingp

Negative 2512 pOkay, I have one codeMS Accesscode database and Im being told that I need to create a second database to hold old information from the original. We will say strongDb1strong is the original and strongDB2strong is the second this is not splitting the database either, its already split. p  pI have been given parameters to query the tables by in strongDB1strong and then put that information queried into strongDB2strong and then go back into the tables in strongDB1strong and delete the fields that were just put in strongDB2strong, so to help keep the strongDB1strong clean and quick.  This part I have and works properly, just a basis for anyone reading. p  pstrongProblemstrong p  pWhen I go back into push the information to DB2 a second time or more, just FYI I have everything coded to a button to handle the queries and pushing of the data to the DB2, because the data has been deleted from the tables already the queries return blank tables or tables with different data, and when I push the data again those tables just over ride the table I had already pushed to DB2, basically just deleting the original. I need the information to combine, not delete one another. The information is from the same table so there should not be any issues with fields.p  pI am using the DoCmd.transferdatabase method...I knowhave been told that there is a linking function with in this command but that wont be applicable for this, they dont want anymore links just the data pushed to a second database.p  pMy thought is to to sift through the table in the DB2, find the first null row, and then insert the newly queried data from DB1 starting at that row, but I cannot find a way to have DB1 and DB2 connection open at the same time so that when I search for the null row in DB2 I can tell the information to insert from DB1 into that row and fill in from there.p  pI have no idea if this is actually possible.p  pI have been trying to use  codeDim rs as DAO.recorder, Dim db as DAO.database, Dim rs2 as DAO.recordset, Dim db2 as DAO.databasecode to set the connection to codeDB1CurrentDbcode and then the codeDB2code set to the path way of the DB2, but I dont think two can be opened at the same time. If they can I am clearly doing something wrong because it is not working.p  pAny ideas would be great. Nothing I have tried is working.p

Negative 2512 pThe two plots below convey roughly the same information. p  ul lipThe one on the left is a histogram where the Y axis represents frequencies i.e. how often we see values within the range associated with each bin. pli lipThe one on the right is a density KDE estimation.

Negative 2512 pI am building a meteor application that creates pdf files from a web page using phantomjs.p  pPhantomJS is called with nodes codechildprocess.execcode function within a fiber using codeMeteor.wrapAsynccode. When I am using any url like google.com, it is working fine and the pdf is created.p  pThe problem is, I want to capture a site served by the same meteor application at invoicePDF. But during the execution of phantomjs the site apparently does not load, thus, it cannot load inside phantomjs, which makes finishing the call to phantomjs impossible.p

Negative 2512 pIm completely tired of using the NetBeans IDE 8.x currently using 8.0.1 for months  it just looks like a hell seriously. When some external changes are made to the project especially a Java EE web application  containing hundredth of Java classes in different packages or an attempt is made to emClean and Buildem to project especially to the enterprise module, emBackground Scanning of Projectsem is initiated which unusually propagates compiletime errors in almost all classes in which classes from the JPA generated a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavaee7tutorialpersistencecriteria002.htm relnofollowstatic metamodela are used in the EJB module as can be seen in the following a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comuilLZ.png relnofollowsnap shota.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuilLZ.png altenter image description herep  pSurprisingly, these erroneous classes, if opened in the IDE, no compiletime errors indicated by a red curly line are shown anymore by the IDE  I cannot say the reason because I myself do not know.p  pSometimes, if the IDE is restarted, it initiates emBackground Scanning of Projectsem that may remove these errors in most cases it does not, if the IDE it restarted again and again for at least 10 timesp  pWhen and why this happens is quite uncertain but there one certain thing  it happens because of emthe JPA generated static metamodelem. The IDE apparently becomes unaware of the classes that end with an underscore the classes of the metamodel. This is merely a wastage of time  it takes hours or days to build an application  I had to create all of these classes all over again from scratch one by one several times.p  hr  pThis did not happen prior to the version 8.x. Both 8.0 and 8.0.1 have the same issue Im not even quite sure about whether it is an issue or not. While using NetBeans 8.0, I incorrectly assumed that the later release would not impose this behaviour.p  hr  pTo reproduce this problem,p  ul liThe application must have a JPA generated static metamodel.li liThe application should not must be using a emClass Libraryem that holds interfaces for remote EJBs.li ul  pIn very small applications, this may or may not happen I myself cannot confirm about the cause of this problem quite well and cannot say anything about this.p  hr  pDoes someone encounter this kind of problems while using NetBeans IDE especially 8.x  this makes almost impossible to develop an application using this IDE  it is merely a frustration Does the IDE have some settings that I might be missing Might I be deploying the application in a wrong wayp  pI can say only one thing  The emBackground Scanning of Projectem is performed incorrectly by the IDE or it is just a hell.p  pThe way I deploy the application Java EE containing some remote EJBs including many local EJBs which are held by a emClass Libraryemp  ul liClean and Build the Class Libraryli liClean and Build the Enterprise application the EJB module denoted by a triangle by the IDE this step is the culpritli liClean and build the Class Library again after completion of the above two stepsli liDeploy the applicationli ul  pThese steps are performed at the very first time the application is built or some major changes are made to the application. Otherwise, only the last two steps are sufficient to deploy the application to the server and I do it usually.p  pWith this problem, it is almost impossible to proceed. Is there any at least temporary solutionworkaround to thisp  psubOne additional thing. This not only happens in Java EE applications but I have another project that uses Spring in which this problem often happens.subp  hr  pstrongEDIT strongp  pSometimes again uncertain when this may happen, major options including emClean and Buildem of the submenu of a Class Library are disabled preventing us from doing emClean and Buildem as indicated by the following a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.como4ILx.png relnofollowsnap shota right click on the Class Library to open the submenu.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.como4ILx.png altenter image description herep  pWhich is enabled, when the IDE is restarted for random number of times 1 time, 2 times, 5 times, 10 times or even more.

Negative 2512 pI am trying to do a photo editing extension like paint with simple functions such as drawing or placing a text view.

The first one is that the image I am drawing on to may be bigger than the screen size and sized to fit screen with AspectFit or similar.

I wrote a ifelse statement connected to the pressing of the OK button that needs to be pressed in order to declare values to the buttons. p  pI did this with the following piece of code.p  precodeprivate void btnValidateClickobject sender, EventArgs e              if btnDrank1.Text  Drank1                      btnDrank1.Text  txtNaam.Text  n  txtInhoud.Text  cl             drank[0].Naam  txtNaam.Text             drank[0].Inhoud  txtInhoud.Text             drank[0].Prijs  Convert.ToDoubletxtPrijs.Text                  else                       if btnDrank2.Text  Drank2                              btnDrank2.Text  txtNaam.Text  n  txtInhoud.Text  cl                 drank[1].Naam  txtNaam.Text                 drank[1].Inhoud  txtInhoud.Text                 drank[1].Prijs  Convert.ToDoubletxtPrijs.Text                          else                              if btnDrank3.Text  Drank3                                      btnDrank3.Text  txtNaam.Text  n  txtInhoud.Text  cl                     drank[2].Naam  txtNaam.Text                     drank[2].Inhoud  txtInhoud.Text                     drank[2].Prijs  Convert.ToDoubletxtPrijs.Text                                  else                                      if btnDrank4.Text  Drank4                                              btnDrank4.Text  txtNaam.Text  n  txtInhoud.Text  cl                         drank[3].Naam  txtNaam.Text                         drank[3].Inhoud  txtInhoud.Text                         drank[3].Prijs  Convert.ToDoubletxtPrijs.Text                                          else                                              if btnDrank5.Text  Drank5                                                      btnDrank5.Text  txtNaam.Text  n  txtInhoud.Text  cl                             drank[4].Naam  txtNaam.Text                             drank[4].Inhoud  txtInhoud.Text                             drank[4].Prijs  Convert.ToDoubletxtPrijs.Text                                                   else                                                      if btnDrank6.Text  Drank6                                                              btnDrank6.Text  txtNaam.Text  n  txtInhoud.Text  cl                                 drank[5].Naam  txtNaam.Text                                 drank[5].Inhoud  txtInhoud.Text                                 drank[5].Prijs  Convert.ToDoubletxtPrijs.Text                                                          else                                                              MessageBox.Show6 dranken is genoeg, My Application,                                 MessageBoxButtons.OKCancel, MessageBoxIcon.Asterisk                              codepre  pI was wondering if there is a way to reduce the amount of code and still get the same result.

Negative 2512 pI want to be able to load in a list of sites and verify that all CSS and JS has been minified. I would prefer to use PHP to do this, but Im at a bit of a loss. p  pIve written a basic script that uses simpleHtmlDom to get the links for all the script tags in the DOM, but after that Im not exactly sure how to verify its been minified other then regex for n. p  pIve also entertained the thought that simpleHtmlDom is not catching all of the scripts such as those loaded in on other scripts and not exactly in the DOM, for this I was going to use CURL, but Im not exactly sure how to proceed. p  pAny suggestions p

Negative 2512 pSo I am looking at these respective classes and subclasses...p  precodepublic class Control     public Control     public ControlString name, String type, ContainerControl owner         do stuff here         public class ContainerControl extends Control     public ContainerControl  super      public ContainerControlString name, String type, ContainerControl owner              supername, type, owner         controls  new Controls exists somewhere else         public class SSTab extends ContainerControl     public SSTab super      public SSTabString name, String value, ContainerControl owner              supername, value, owner       codepre  pI am confused about the purpose behind the method declarations with no parameters which use super .  From the research I have done, I would be inclined to believe that they were necessary for either overloading the methods with properties from respective parent classes, or overriding. However, as they are calling super which to my understanding would find the parameterless method in the super class which once again does the same thing, I dont see what could actually be getting changed. p  pAs a result of being part of a huge project with massive amounts of subclasses I cant just remove the first method declarations from each class and run to see what happens to identify whether there is a purpose, and I cant seem to find a reference to explain what these initial method declarations which use super are actually doing.p  pAny help or links would be incredibly appreciatedp  hr  pFollow up question p  pWhy cant SSTab just be initialized with parameters with CControl which can be initialized with parameters with Control I dont see how the parameterless constructor variables are necessary to initialize the kinds of objects, when there are constructor variables with parameters which call super anyways. p
Negative 2512 pI have an Ant script that I use to compile a project, and recently Ive been trying to implement Maven to said project to deal with libraries references. I managed to do aokay and create a pom.xml script that copies the libraries into the lib folder and then invokes the build.xml of Ant to build the whole project.p  pBut then I tried to make ant invoke a function from the main class of the project by making it extend the Task class and implementing the execute method, but for some reason the build.xml script says that said function doesnt exist. It finds the class, alright, but not the function. Whats weirder is the fact that I tried it in a previous version that doesnt have Maven implemented, and it works perfectly fine.p  pThis is the bit in the ant build.xml that sets the path and defines the taskp  precodeltpath idclassesgt     ltpathelement pathbasedirbin gt     ltfileset dirlib.dir includes.jargt ltpathgt lttaskdef namegetVersionTask      classnameus.inswitch.jreport.JReport  classpathrefclassesgt ltgetVersionTaskgt codepre  pAnd this is, in short, the class in question with the unnecesary things removedp  precodeimport org.apache.tools.ant.BuildException import org.apache.tools.ant.Task  public class JReport extends Task       public void execute throws BuildException          getProject.setPropertyversion, version         Date date         datenew Date         DateFormat formatDateFormat.getDateInstance         getProject.setPropertydate,format.formatdate       codepre  pIn both project cases, the files are the same through and through.p  pI think that, somehow, one being a Maven project and the other not being one is affecting something.

What I want, is that when I return to the codeRadioCabinetActivitycode, I would like that codeRadioSitecode had updated values inside. I hope that Ive explained well the situation.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pThank you Sufian. To recap I have the main activity that is codeRadioCabinetActivitycode that has a codeRadioSitecode object. p  pcodeRadioSitecode object has several subobjects. So I pass the codeRadioSiteSubsectioncode subobject list of codeRadioSitecode to the codeCabinetAdaptercode to show it in codeListviewcode. Inside codeCabinetAdaptercode I have an codeOnClickListenercode in which I pass the single  codeRadioSiteSubsectioncode object to the next activity codeRadioCabinetDefectActivitycode. In this activity, I have another adapter codeCabinetDefectAdaptercode where I pass a subobject list of codeRadioSiteSubsectioncode, named codeRadioSiteDefectcode. In this last adapter, I have an  codeOnCheckedChangeListenercode for checkboxes and when its called, I update the corresponding field on codeRadioSiteDefectcode object. The desired final situation is to have the original codeRadioSitecode object modified when I return back to codeRadioCabinetActivitycode. p  pI know that is a little twisted p

Negative 2512 pThe scenario is simple UI call RESTful API to get an object tree, then UI change some data and call RESTful API to update it.p  pBut for security or performance reason..., my RESTful API can NOT bring the whole object tree to the UI.p  pWe have two choose for this purpose  creating an individual Java Bean for RESTful API or extend existing business Java Bean plus JsonIgnore.p  pThe second looks smarter because we reuse business class. p  pBut Now we have a trouble I need to merge the object from UI with the object from DB, otherwise I will lose some data.p  pBut how do I know which piece of data will come from UI I know I can hard code to copy fields one by one. But this way is dangerous.p  pI am asking for generic way to avoid hard code to copy fields.p  pI tried org.apache.commons.beanutils.BeanUtils, but it cant meet the requirement because it always overwrite target fields.p  pSo I am thinking this waybr If the field in UI bean is not Null, then overwrite the value of the same name field in destination bean. but how do I handle if the field is some kind of primitive type like int which have default value 0  I dont know if the field really carry an UI value 0 or just not comes back from UI.p  pI tried to convert primitive type to object type, but it still have troubles on boolean type, many java tools dont support  Boolean isValid like BeanUtils. And this kind converting is dangerous on existing code.p  pI tried those codep  precodeJacksonAnnotationIntrospector ai  new JacksonAnnotationIntrospector AnnotatedClass ac  AnnotatedClass.constructMyClassDTO.class, ai, null     String[] ignoredList  ai.findPropertiesToIgnoreac            forString one ignoredList         System.out.printlnone      codepre  pbut ignoredList  is always null.

Negative 2512 pI think theres a potential way for users to get Apple inapp purchases for free, by sharing legitimate Apple receipts. Id like to find a way to prevent this for my app. Check my logic  heres the architecturep  p1 There is a game app that stores users purchases in an online database. For example, an items database tracks which Characters have a Magic Sword.p  p2 When a user purchases a Magic Sword IAP on an iOS client device using the regular Apple methods, Apple generates a receipt and sends it to the client.p  p3 The client app then sends the receipt securely to a backend verification server for validation and to update the database.p  p4 The server verifies the receipt with Apple, and on success updates the database, setting the clients Characters possessions to include a Magic Sword.p  pAll pretty standard.p  pWhat is stopping Evil Person A from logging in, and legitimately buying the Magic Sword, intercepting Apples receipt, and handing it to his friend Evil Person Bp  pEvil Person B logs in with some hacked client which still makes secure calls to the backend server, or a program that makes secure calls as if it were the client, makes the web request to verify the emsameem Apple receipt, and receives the Magic Sword.p  pEvil Person C does the same, etc. etc.p  pIn each case Apple will tell the verification server that the receipt is valid it is the problem is the receipt doesnt belong to the user who is calling the server.p  pI cant think of a way to confirm that the receipt and the person asking for verification of the receipt belong to each other.p  pAndroid IAPs get around this problem by allowing a user payload to be specified at purchase time, and that value becomes part of the receipt. That can be used to link a receipt to a user.p  pThe closest almostfix I could come up with is maintaining a list of the uniqueIDs of each receipt that has been verified, and disallowing any attempt to verify a receipt on this list. But then we run into problems with Restore Purchases, Plus, I havent seen anything from Apple recommending receipt tracking as a best practice.p  pAm I way off base here Is there a better way to architect the connections between the client app doing the purchasing, the backend server, Apple and the database Or is this legitp  pedited for typop
Negative 2512 pId like to know what is the best way to secure SSL keys and certificates for web applications. I am using the rolesprofiles pattern. Here is the scenariop  ul liI have a web application. There is a Puppet module that sets up the application. This module also sets up the SSL keys and certs required for it to run. These files are committed in the same repo which is insecure under appfiles directory and are then places at the right locations using codefilecode type.li liThere is a profile manifest that puts the stack together for this application  install and setup apache, install and setup memcached, install php and setup the application using the above module.li ul  pNow the SSL keys and certs are checked in the same repo and thats probably not the best way to do it. I am considering using hieraeyaml module and then put the encrypted version of these certs and keys in a hiera file.p  pI was just wondering if thats the way most of the people do this Or are there better ways of handling thisp
Negative 2512 pstrongGoalstrong I am trying to make a Neo4j instance of the DBLP database on the basis of the publicly available DBLP XML file available a hrefhttpdblp.unitrier.dexml relnofollowherea. I have modeled the database as a bipartite graph where the authors are in one set and the publications in the other set. To obtain all coauthors of John Doe one has to make the following Cypher queryp  pMATCH aAuthor[WROTE]publicationlt[WROTE]bAuthor WHERE a.name  John Doe RETURN DISTINCT bp  pstrongProblem 1strong There seems to be a problem partly related to special characters, such as , , , etc. When I, in my browser at the address a hrefhttplocalhost7474browser relnofollowhttplocalhost7474browsera, enter the query MATCH aAuthor[WROTE]plt[WROTE]bAuthor WHERE a.name  Jan Arne Telle RETURN DISTINCT b, I should get 58 unique results coauthors, but I get 79 results. For instance, coauthor Danil Paulusma is split into three results Dani, , l Paulusma. But in fact, I also get coauthor David Keldsen as three results David Keldsen, David, and Keldsen.

Ive set a break point in the codeonReceivecode method and it is never hit. Ive also added logging and nothing shows in the logcat. So Im 100 sure the receiver is not being called. Ive also tried increasing the sleep time in the thread, because codesetInexactRepeatingcode fires very inexactly, but I can wait for ages and it is still not called.p  pIve also tried registering it in the test projects manifest instead of programmatically and the results are the same.p  pWhy is the receiver not being calledp  hr  pUPDATEbr strongI can confirm the codeAlarmManagercode is not the issuestrong. Alarms are correctly registered according to adb dumpsys alarm.p  pIm now trying to get the receiver to run by calling codesendBroadcastcode, but Im in a dead end. The receiver just wont get called. I tried the main app context, the test case context, even codeActivityInstrumentationTestCase2code. Tried also adding WakeLocks and nothing. Theres just no way of getting it called. I think this might be caused by some flags in the intent or intent filter android seems to be really picky with flags.p

Negative 2512 pI am trying to upgrade my Windows phone 8 app to Windows phone 8.1 silver light app. The problem is that in Windows Phone 8 clicking on the App List icon of the toast notification navigated you to the Application Main Page and clicking on the toast notification navigated you to a different page based on the navigation URI. This is not happening in 8.1 silver light as clicking on the app list icon navigates you to the navigation Uri of the first toast message instead of launching the main application page. Is there any way to have the older behavior in 8.1 silver light or is there any way to map the app list icon in the toast message to a URI.  Thanks p
Negative 2512 pI have a raw binary dump of assembler which is split into blocks code, data, ignored, images etc. I also have a walker that increments its position via a virtual  operator. If its in a data block, that moves up to 32 bytes, code the number of bytes in an instruction, ignored moves the size of the block etc. When it reaches the end of the block, it needs to transform into a walker for type of the next block while keeping the data, data pointer, block lookup etc.p  pThere are ways to do this using switch statements, an array of objects pointing to the same base etc but I was wondering if theres a better way To somehow transform a derived object into a different object with the same physical base classp

Negative 2512 pIve build an application that uses Tesseract V3.03 rc1 to identify some specific text strings. These are, unfortunately, printed on a custom font that requires that I build my own traineddata file.

Negative 2512 pIs it possible to create a unique URL to link to information that is called and displayed from a databasep  p[I am struggling to articulate this question, so any suggestions for revising it are welcome.]p  pSpecifics I have a page that includes an embedded map and related information about each location stored in a separate database.  Users can navigate through the locations by clicking the markers on the map or by using navigation buttons in the sidebar.  Either case zooms in on the marker and displays information about the location in the sidebar. All this works fine, but because the information is simply placed in divs, the pages URL is always the same regardless of what is being displayed. p  pI would like to be able to create and share links to the individual locations, which would open with the point selected in the map and the information displayed in the sidebar.p  pI use a javascript function to call the information from the database. Here is a simplified version of that codep  precodelta href onClickcallMarkermarkerNumgtClick Meltagt   function callMarkermarkerNum          var sql  new data.SQL user me          var sqlquery  SELECT  FROM mapname WHERE markerid    markerNum         sql.executesqlquery         .donefunctiondata              console.logdata.rows[0]              var title  data.rows[0].title               Displays the ID of the object in the external information box             document.getElementByIdtitle.innerHTML data.rows[0].title  codepre  pSince each location is tagged with a unique ID number markerid in the database, it seems like this could be appended to the end of the current URL to create a unique URL associated with each point. Or maybe the ID number markerid could somehow be assigned to a div ID as a variable within the page.  I am not sure how to do either or if either would work.p  pAny ideas or direction would be appreciated. I have been searching a lot of different approaches, but have not found anything that seems to address this problem.p

Negative 2512 pEvery example Ive seen for Encog neural nets has involved XOR or something very simple. I have around 10,000 sentences and each word in the sentence has some type of tag. The input layer needs to take 2 inputs, the previous word and the current word. If there is no previous word, then the 1st input is not activated at all. I need to go through each sentence like this. Each word is contingent on the previous word, so I cant just have an array that looks similar to the XOR example. Furthermore, I dont really want to load all the words from 10,000 sentences into an array, Id rather scan one sentence at a time and once I reach EOF, start back at the beginning. p  pHow should I go about doing this Im not super comfortable with Encog because all the examples Ive seen have either been XOR or extremely complicated.p  pThere are 2 inputs... Each input consists of 30 neurons. The chance of the word being a certain tag is used as inputs. So, most of the neurons get 0, the others get probability inputs like .5, .3, and .2. When I say arent activated I just mean that all the neurons are set to 0. The output layer represents all the possible tags, so, its 30. Whatever one of the output neurons has the highest number is the tag that is chosen.p  pIm not sure how to go through all 10,000 sentences and lookup each word in each sentence for the inputs and activate that input in the demos of Encog that Ive seen. p  pIt seems that the networks are trained with a single array holding all training data, and that is looped through until the network is trained. I would like to train the network with many different arrays an array per sentence and then look through them all again.p  pThis format is clearly not going to work for what Im doingp  precode    do      train.iteration     System.out.println     Epoch   epoch   Error  train.getError     epoch      whiletrain.getError gt 0.01 codepre

Negative 2512 pI have an application that is using the JPlayer Circle Player to play short audios for transcription purposes.  Each of these audios originates as a .vox file that has been converted to .wav by SoX.  When the Play button is pressed, the audio plays but the green circle does not display.  Once the clip has played, pressing play again does show the green circle advancing.p  pI assume that this is because either the original vox format or the wav format does not contain any length data so that player doesnt know this until it tries to play it.  Once it learns the length, the circle can display.p  pHow might this be overcome  Can the circle player somehow preload the audio to determine its length before playing  Is there something different I could be doing in the SoX conversion  Would converting to something other than WAV work better  JPlayer counsels against using WAV but doesnt say why, and it plays well enough except for this.  p  pOr is there something else Im doing wrongp  pstrongUPDATE 1strong after reading the original .vox file and the converted .wav file with soxi, it appears that duration data exists in both places, thus no reason the player cannot know this in advance.  So conversion would seem to be off the hook as the culprit.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong I added some JPlayer event handlers for the loadedmetadata and play events which shows pretty clearly the problem described above.p  precodejqueryjplayer.bind.jPlayer.event.loadedmetadata , functionevent   Add a listener log the duration on load     console.logloadedmetadata this audio has a duration of   event.jPlayer.status.duration   seconds.       jqueryjplayer.bind.jPlayer.event.play , functionevent   Add a listener log the duration on play     console.logplay this audio has a duration of   event.jPlayer.status.duration   seconds.      codepre  pThis produced the following output in the logsp  precodeloadedmetadata this audio has a duration of 0 seconds. play this audio has a duration of 0 seconds. play this audio has a duration of 10.72 seconds. codepre  pindicating that the duration isnt known until the first playthrough.p  pstrongUPDATE 3 retracting UPDATE 1strong Although soxi is somehow able to extract duration data from the file, that doesnt necessarily mean that the HTML5 browser is able to do so.  A different algorithm may be in place there.  The conversion is back on the hook.  I cant see how it could be anything else.p  pI thought it might be because the Circle Player lives inside a modal dialog, but is instantiated when the page that invokes the modal dialog is loaded and only upon showing the modal dialog was the media loaded.  I changed that to a cleaner design where the Circle Player is instantiated every time the modal dialog is shown and the media loaded at that time and destroyed when the modal goes away, but the problem remains.p  pstrongSAMPLE FILEstrongp  pa hrefhttpsmega.co.nz1lsjya7Qi5G8fnhbZL4hvDGe8rifT1TZU1HJvpw7T7k5RvXpb9I relnofollowDownload sample filea for testing.

And Excel when encounters a file with extension CSV it assumes it is single byte order and opens it that way.

Negative 2512 pIm working on a web application Angular  Rails that server assets through CloudFront CDN. The application is served though nginx thats correctly set up to set AccessControlAllowOrigin header. CloudFront is set up to forward the header.p  pProblem is that the header is missing on the first response for an Angular template, but its correctly present on subsequent responses if I refresh the page.p  pFor example, if I clear all history and cache in Chrome and visit the page, the response for a template file will not have AccessControlAllowOrigin header. If I refresh the page, the response for the template will have the header.p  pI noticed that if I clear all history and cache, but not cookies, it continues to work correctly.p  pIt behaves similar on Firefox. If I clear all history and cache it doesnt work on the first response, but it works correctly on subsequent responses. After clearing all history and cache but without cookies, it continues to work correctly, unlike on Chrome.p  pAlso, if I open development tools and disable cache in Firefox, the header is missing on every response.p  pDo you know what the problem might be or where should I look nextp  pThanks.p

Negative 2512 pduring the tests of my iOSApp I discovered an interesting phenomenon. The app displays mainly videocontent, embedded in a UIScrollview. The content is loaded entirely when the app starts.

But when I transfer the Application on my iPhone, the amount of the memory used is extremely low. p  pSo here is my Question Why does the Simulator throw a MemoryException, while on the actual device none of these problems occur and the app works properly p  pThank you for answeringp

Negative 2512 pI have a dynamic layout window app, that by changing the value in a combo box, a value in a text box should change as well. The text box is part of a grid, that is defined in codeltwindow.resourcesgtcode and was added to the visual tree at strongrun timestrongp  precode grpEditFrame.Content  this.Resources[grdARP] as Grid  the text box is inside this grid codepre  pso this is what I did p  precodegrpEditFrame.Content as Grid.

By debugging I cant see they exist, but codeFindNamecode just doesnt work p  pSo looking up in Google I saw that the problem is that controls that are created at run time, their name are not been registered automatically, so the programmer must do it himself. But then I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2214737findnamereturningnullanswertabactivetabtopthisa.p  pSo if a control was created by XAML, like what I did defined them in codeltwindows.resourcesgtcode  so what is the problemp  pFurther more, if Im not wrong, controls that are in codeltwindows.resourcesgtcode are being created at compile timep  pEither why, I think that the names must have been registed, so why cant find themp  pbrbrp  pThis is my codeltwindows.resourcesgtcode definition for the grid abovep  precode ltGrid xKeygrdARP HorizontalAlignmentRight Width572gt         ltLabel ContentDestination MAC HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin74,18,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltLabel ContentSource MAC HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin199,18,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltLabel ContentEthernet Type HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin319,18,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin74,41,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width120 MaxLength12gt         ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin199,41,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width120 MaxLength12gt         ltTextBox NametxtEthernetType HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin324,41,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width100 MaxLength4gt         ltLabel Content0x0000 HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin21,41,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltTextBox NametxtHardwareType HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin429,41,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width110 MaxLength2gt         ltLabel ContentHardeware type HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin429,18,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop RenderTransformOrigin0.359,0.5gt         ltLabel ContentProtocol type HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin69,72,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltLabel Content0x0010 HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin21,98,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltTextBox NametxtProtocolType HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin74,98,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width76 MaxLength4gt         ltLabel ContentHardware size HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin150,72,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltTextBox NametxtHardwareSize HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin155,98,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width78 MaxLength2gt         ltLabel ContentProtocol size HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin234,72,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltTextBox NametxtProtocolSize  HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin238,98,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width73 MaxLength2gt         ltLabel ContentOpcode HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin311,72,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltTextBox NametxtOpcode HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin316,98,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width50 MaxLength4gt         ltLabel ContentSender MAC HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin366,72,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin371,98,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width93 MaxLength12gt         ltLabel ContentSender IP Height26 VerticalAlignmentTop Margin459,72,44,0gt         ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin464,98,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width75 MaxLength8gt         ltLabel Content0x0020 HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin21,157,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltLabel ContentTarget MAC HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin74,134,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin74,160,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width102 MaxLength12gt         ltLabel ContentTarget IP HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin181,134,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin181,160,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width120 MaxLength8gt         ltLabel ContentRAW optional HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin306,134,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop gt         ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height23 Margin306,160,0,0 TextWrappingWrap Text VerticalAlignmentTop Width233 MaxLength12 ToolTipAny data put here has no effectgt         ltLabel Content0x0030 HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin21,216,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTopgt         ltTextBox HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin74,216,0,10 TextWrappingWrap Text Width465gt         ltLabel ContentRAW  optional HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin74,190,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop  ToolTipAny data put here has no effectgt     ltGridgt codepre  pAnd this is my C code behind functionp  precode        private void cmdArpHardwareTypesSelectionChangedobject sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e              set the hardware type in txtHardwareType text box         grpEditFrame.Content as Grid.

The below is not working as the column still wraps to the minimum width it can go.p  precodeltaspGridView IDGridview1 runatserver AllowSortingTrue AutoGenerateColumnsFalse Width100         ForeColor333333gt         ltAlternatingRowStyle BackColorWhite gt         ltcolumnsgt             ltaspboundfield DataFieldColumn1 HeaderTextColumn1 htmlencodefalse HeaderStyleWidth100px ItemStyleWidth100pxgtltaspboundfieldgt             ltaspboundfield DataFieldColumn2 HeaderTextColumn1 HeaderStyleWidth100px ItemStyleWidth100pxgtltaspboundfieldgt             ltaspboundfield DataFieldColumn2 HeaderTextColumn2 HeaderStyleWidth100px ItemStyleWidth100pxgtltaspboundfieldgt             ltaspboundfield DataFieldColumn3 HeaderTextColumn3 HeaderStyleWidth100px ItemStyleWidth100pxgtltaspboundfieldgt             ltaspboundfield DataFieldColumn4 HeaderTextColumn4 HeaderStyleWidth100px ItemStyleWidth100pxgtltaspboundfieldgt             ltaspboundfield DataFieldColumn5 HeaderTextColumn5 HeaderStyleWidth100px ItemStyleWidth100pxgtltaspboundfieldgt          ltcolumnsgt         ltEditRowStyle BackColor2461BF gt         ltFooterStyle BackColor507CD1 FontBoldFalse ForeColorBlackgt         ltHeaderStyle BackColor507CD1 FontBoldFalse ForeColorBlackgt         ltPagerStyle BackColor2461BF ForeColorWhite HorizontalAlignCenter gt         ltRowStyle BackColorEFF3FB gt         ltSelectedRowStyle BackColorD1DDF1 FontBoldFalse ForeColor333333 gt         ltSortedAscendingCellStyle BackColorF5F7FB gt         ltSortedAscendingHeaderStyle BackColor6D95E1 gt         ltSortedDescendingCellStyle BackColorE9EBEF gt         ltSortedDescendingHeaderStyle BackColor4870BE gt     ltaspGridViewgt codepre
Negative 2512 pI just started learning programming and i know my questions are silly, but i have spent too much time looking around without success. So here is what i was trying to do.p  pA program that will be comparing strings all in lower case alphabets, a line can have more than 1 word and words are separated by a space. Each line is used for comparision, then words in next line are compared separately. Here is the example of user inputp  pstrongchina paris moscow antarcticastrongp  pstrongland water airstrongp  pstrongaluminium ironstrongp  pthose three lines above will be used to compare words in those lines and output a result, line 1 will be comparing word china paris moscow antarctica, line two will compare word land water air, and same goes for line 3..... Program terminates when result is output and BTW user may enter more than 3 lines, no limit Apologies for not knowing much.p
Negative 2512 pSo I have a table called persons in a database test1 p  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[persons]     [ID] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,     [LastName] [varchar]50 NULL,     [FirstName] [varchar]50 NULL,     [Job] [varchar]50 NULL,     [Extension] [char]10 NULL,     [EMail] [varchar]50 NULL,     [Dept] [int] NULL,     [MobileNumber] [char]10 NULL,     [District] [int] NULL,     [Status] [varchar]50 NULL,     [InOutStatus] [varchar]5 NULL,     [InOutDescr] [varchar]50 NULL,     [InOutDirections] [varchar]255 NULL,     [InOutReturn] [varchar]50 NULL,     [login] [varchar]50 NULL,     [StatusExpiry] [datetime] NULL  ON [PRIMARY] codepre  pAnd a table called Users in a database test2p  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Users]     [UserID] [int] NOT NULL,     [Firstname] [nvarchar]50 NULL,     [Lastname] [nvarchar]50 NULL,     [Username] [nvarchar]50 NULL,     [Status] [nvarchar]50 NULL  ON [PRIMARY] codepre  pWhat Im trying to do is create a Trigger where if the FirstName, LastName, login, andor Status column in the persons table is updated, then the same value is updated in its identical column in the Users table.

Negative 2512 pHi there so i went on the Jquery api documentation website for this function and still dont understand how it works.  Did some extended research and still dont understand it.p  pSo im gonna give an example and just would like somebody to walk through what Im doing wrong and what is the right thing to do.p  pFor Example Lets say i would like to animate a pink squarep  precodeltbodygt  ltdiv idsquaregt  ltdivgt  ltbodygt ltstylegt square  width 100px height 100px background pink border 1px solid aqua   .square  width 100px height 100px background pink border 1px solid aqua    ltstylegt   ltscriptgt square.clickfunction this.animatewidth 500px, height 500px    which makes this pink square animate to  500px X 500px and then once its rechecked i put the toggle class to have it toggle        class back to .square which is the original position, But it seems not to    be working.   square.clickfunction square.toggleClass.square     ltscriptgt codepre
Negative 2512 pI am building an API using Laravel which will be used by both my Mobile and Web Applications. I am confused regarding authentication.p  pBasically the web application will be used by users both in logged in state and visitor state.p  pHow would authentication work in that case If the API uses usernamepassword to authenticate a user what about visitorsp  pAlso, how do I make sure its the webapp and mobile app thats making a request to the API How do I ensure that someone doesnt programatically doesnt access the API and its only my apps that can request access to datap
Negative 2512 pIt is well known or should be that binding the result of a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppalgorithmmin relnofollowcodestdmincodea to a codeconstcode reference is a very bad idea, whenever one of the arguments of codestdmincode is a rvalue, since codeconstcode reference binding is not propagated through function return. So the following codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltalgorithmgt  int main      int n  42     const intamp r  stdminn  1, n  1  r is dangling after this line     stdcout ltlt r  codepre  pshould produce undefined behaviour since codercode is dangling.
