Positive 965 pIm developing a wordpress plugin, and the plugin makes use of a composer package. For reference the plugin Im developing is herep  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comtunapandawph5pxapi relnofollowhttpsgithub.comtunapandawph5pxapiap  pIm at the stage where it works locally, and I would like to publish it to the wordpress plugin repository.p  pIn order to use the plugin, I need to run codecomposer installcode inside the plugin directory to have the composer package installed. My question is, how does this plays together with the plugin repository and what the best practice to get this to work Because obviously, if I would just publish the plugin to the repository and if someone would install it from there it would not work, since then the composer package which is a dependency would not be installed.p  pI see two different ways to deal with thisp  ul lipPut my codevendorcode directory under source control and check it in to the repository. This doesnt feel like an ideal solution since I would lose much of the point of using a package manager such as composer in the first place.pli lipAvoid using composer all together, and instead just take the code for the package I need and put that under source control.pli ul  pSo my question is, what is the best practice for this Anyone who could point me to a reference wordpress plugin that uses external dependenciesp

Is there no way to tell eclipse where to store downloaded plugins Or some other way to download plugins to some specific folder outside eclipse Any suggestions are appreciated.p
Positive 965 pWe currently have an application that is a plugin host, thus having the Pipeline folder in its application directory. All of the plugins that are managed through this host are plugins relating to a windows service that is running, and that windows service is basically for managing one county for the purpose of this example. p  pWhat we want to achieve is to be able to install multiple instances of this windows service and to manage each of these through the host application. Our original thought was to have several Pipeline folders, one for each county which manages its instance of the windows service but I dont see how we are going to do this since it seems like the Pipeline folder naming convention is set in stone and there is no way to dynamically point your application to a specific Pipeline folder.p  pAny thoughtsp
Positive 965 pSo I was just playing with the idea of user plugins. I wrote a simple class that prints out a String. Then I wrote an interface which requires a single method for editing that String. Now, Id like to have the user be able to insert a Jar file into a folder packaged with the program and my program reads it in, and uses it as a class which implements the interface which I created. So basically I am looking for a way of reading in a jar files contents, and using its class as one of my programs classes. Apologies in advanced for any incorrect terminology, I am very new to this. If this is the wrong way to approaching the problem let me know, Im open to a better way.

Positive 965 pI am writing a plugin for a 3rd party app which I only have the .EXE and dot net .DLL for. p  pThe way I code the plugin is by creating a Visual Studio C library project, add the .EXE and .DLL files from the 3rd party app as references, then extend the emIPluginem class defined in the .DLL.p  pAfter I build my project I take my plugins .DLL and copy it to the 3rd party applications Plugins directory then start the application. From that point on I really dont know what happens at that point. I guess the application dynamically loads my DLL by scanning the emPluginsem folder then loads it all that stuff I know nothing about.p  pAt that point the application is running as a .EXE. p  pIs there a way I can use Visual Studio to attach to the .EXE process and then debug my DLL code thats running from withing that processp  pI know my code is in there somewhere but since its not an .EXE I dont see how I could attach to it. Thank you,p  pJanp

Negative 965 pI am trying order the files on a common fileshare of my department, containing thousands of documents of various filetypes. My idea was to sort them by contentrelated keywords.

Copernic does not seem to provide any info at all.p  pI am very grateful for any idea on how to access these generated keywords. Thank you in advancep

Going withp  precodestring utf16  System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetStringbytes codepre  pmakes better use of the emstringem, but it wont work for data that contains invalid Unicode characters say mismatched surrogate pairs.  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms172827.aspx relnofollowThis MSDN articlea shows this exact poor technique.p  pLets look at a simple examplep  precodebyte[] bytes  new byte[]  0x41, 0x00, 0x31, 0x00 string utf16  System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetStringbytes byte[] utf16bytes  System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetBytesutf16 codepre  pIn this case embytesem and emutf16bytesem are the same, because the orginal embytesem were a UTF16 string.  Doing this same procedure with base64 encoding gives 16member embase64bytesem array.p  pNow, repeat the procedure with invalid UTF16 datap  precodebyte[] bytes  new byte[]  0x41, 0x00, 0x00, 0xD8 codepre  pYoull find that emutf16bytesem do not match the original data.p  pIve written code that uses UFFFD as an escape before invalid Unicode characters it works, but Id like to know if there is a more standard technique than something I just cooked up on my own.  Not to mention, I dont like emcatcheming the emDecoderFallbackExceptionem as the way of detecting invalid characters.p  pI guess you could call this a base BMP or base UTF16 encoding using all the characters in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane.

Negative 965 pI have this problem to work onp  pThe sum higher order procedure can be generalised even further to capture the idea of combining terms with a fixed operator. The mathematical product operator is a specific example of this idea, with multiplication replacing the addition of the summation operator. The procedure accumulate, started below, is intended to capture this idea. The combiner parameter represents the operator that is used to reduce the terms, and the base parameter represents the value that is returned when there are no terms left to be combined. For example, if we have already implemented the accumulate procedure, then we could define the sum procedure asp  pdefine sum accumulate  0p  pComplete the definition of accumulate so that it behaves according to this description.p  precode          define accumulate              lambda combiner base                 lambda term start next stop                    if gt start stop                         ...                         ... codepre  pI inserted as the last two linesp  precode   base    combiner base accumulate combiner start stop start next stop codepre  pbut, I have no idea if this is correct nor how to actually use the sum procedure to call accumulate and hence sum up numbers.p

Negative 965 pI have a setup my own git repository with gitosis on dedicated debian server. The server is visible via port 22 from outside the port 22 is forwarded from my router to my git server. On the local network the git repository works perfectly. The problem happens once I try to do git clone.. from remote server. So once I do git clone.. from remote I am getting git clone hung after cloning around 2030 of the repository small around 2MB and I think this is the random percentage. I can do scp to and from the git server without any problems. Also as I mentioned the git clone, push, etc works perfectly within my internal network. Any idea how to debug this problem thanksp

Negative 965 pIve been playing around lately with Entity Framework, WCF RIA Services, and Silverlight 4.  Im impressed by how rapidly you can develop an application with these tools, and you get a lot for free, such as the Silverlight UI automatically knowing about certain validations that are included as DataAnnotations on the EF model.  However, it seems like in a large application it would be undesirable to have a dependency on EF pushed all the way through the entire application including the business logic and UI.p  pI know that you can use POCO  IPOCO with Entity Framework, and that is certainly an option for me.  However, if you go that route, you lose some of the automagic stuff such as Silverlight being able to show model validations without any extra work.p  pHow are people dealing with this  Do you give up some of the power and put interfaces in between the different layers in order to decouple the other layers from EF  Or do you give up on decoupling in order to allow for more rapid development  Is there some way to have my cake and eat it too that Im not seeingp

Negative 965 pI have an application which has several unrelated tables in its db. Ill explain by using an autoupdating version of the SO homepage as an example, so lets say I have the tables strongusersstrong, strongcommentsstrong and strongquestionsstrong.p  pThe homepage client side needs to periodically poll the server, and get a log of all the new events that have happened. I.e., Id like to display somehow the new questions, comments and users that have been added to SO since the last poll.p  pOn way would be to simply keep a variable on the client side containing the last index of each of my tables, send it to the server, and have the server send me the new users, comments and questions.p  pstrongThe problem is,strong what happens when I add a new type of information, say, votes. Now I have to store another variable on the clientside, and the server has to poll another table. And so on, for every new type of information I keep.p  pIm looking for a solution that helps me avoid this.p  pAnother problem  say Id like to see all the events that have happened since last time, but sorted according to when they took place.p  pOne direction I had is to have a single events table, which contains the info about when each event happened. I can then poll only this table, and get a list of all the new events that have happened. The problem is that each event is pretty different a new comment has different columns than a new upvote, etc. So Im not sure how to implement this, or if this is even a good idea.p  pDoes anybody have any ideas how I can solve this This seems like something that would come up a lot, but I dont really have much experience with databases, unfortunately.p  pThanksp

Negative 965 pThe problem is in the question. Ive done a thorough investigation for solutions in regards to this and I know there are topics to this and Ive followed them too and nothing has worked. That being said Ill list out exactly everything Ive done so far. I am running PHP 5.2.14 with Zend Debugging on the latest Eclipse version on my Windows XP computer. I have a 1 GB of RAM.

From there I accepted the certs from this line on the welcome pagep  blockquote   pFor OpenSSL support please use the test certificate with https 127.0.0.1 or https localhost.p blockquote  pOn that same section I checked codephpinfocode. Under Environment, codeSERVER[HTTPS]code is codeoncode. Under Apache Environment, codeHTTPScode is codeOncode. Under PHP Variables, codeSERVER[HTTPS]code is codeOncode. Under Phar, codeOpenSSL supportcode is codedisabledcode install extopenssl. I dont know how to enable the Phar one.p  pNow regarding the files themselves in Cxampp, I went to the PHP folder. Under both production and development php.ini files better safe than sorry, I have codeallowurlfopenOncode, codeallowurlincludeOncode, and I removed the semicolon, so that codeextensionphpopenssl.dllcode is no longer commented out. I even confirmed that the .dll is in the ext folder of the PHP folder. Both libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll are in the PHP and Apache folders.

Negative 965 pemapologies for the somewhat lengthy introemp  pDuring development of an application which prefaults an entire large file 400MB into the buffer cache for speeding up the actual run later, I tested whether reading 4MB at a time still had any noticeable benefits over reading only 1MB chunks at a time. Surprisingly, the smaller requests actually turned out to be faster. This seemed counterintuitive, so I ran a more extensive test.p  pThe buffer cache was purged before running the tests just for laughs, I did one run with the file in the buffers, too. The buffer cache delivers upwards of 2GBs regardless of request size, though with a surprising  30 random variance.br All reads used overlapped ReadFile with the same target buffer the handle was opened with codeFILEFLAGOVERLAPPEDcode and emwithoutem codeFILEFLAGNOBUFFERINGcode. The harddisk used is somewhat elderly but fully functional, NTFS has a cluster size of 8kB. The disk was defragmented after an initial run 6 fragments vs. unfragmented, zero difference. For better figures, I used a larger file too, below numbers are for reading 1GB.p  pThe results were really surprisingp  precode4MB x 256     5ms per request,    completion 25.8s  40 MBs 1MB x 1024    11.7ms per request, completion 23.3s  43 MBs 32kB x 32768  12.6ms per request, completion 15.5s  66 MBs 16kB x 65536  12.8ms per request, completion 13.5s  75 MBs codepre  pSo, this suggests that submitting emten thousands of requests two clusters in lengthem is actually better than submitting a few hundred large, contiguous reads. The submit time time before ReadFile returns does go up substantially as the number of requests goes up, but asynchronous completion time nearly halves.br Kernel CPU time is around 56 in every case on a quadcore, so one should really say 2030 while the asynchronous reads are completing, which is a surprising amount of CPU  apparently the OS does some nonneglegible amount of busy waiting, too. 30 CPU for 25 seconds at 2.6 GHz, thats quite a few cycles for doing nothing.p  pAny idea how this can be explained Maybe someone here has a deeper insight of the inner workings of Windows overlapped IO Or, is there something substantially wrong with the idea that you can use ReadFile for reading a megabyte of datap  pI can see how an IO scheduler would be able to optimize multiple requests by minimizing seeks, especially when requests are random access which they arent. I can also see how a harddisk would be able to perform a similar optimization given a few requests in the NCQ.br However, were talking about ridiculous numbers of ridiculously small requests  which nevertheless outperform what appears to be sensible by a factor of 2.p  pstrongSidenotestrong The clear winner is memory mapping. Im almost inclined to add unsurprisingly because I am a big fan of memory mapping, but in this case, it actually emdoes surpriseem me, as the requests are even smaller and the OS should be even less able to predict and schedule the IO. I didnt test memory mapping at first because it seemed counterintuitive that it might be able to compete even remotely. So much for your intuition, heh.p  pMappingunmapping a view repeatedly at different offsets takes practically zero time. Using a 16MB view and faulting every page with a simple for loop reading a single byte per page completes in 9.2 secs  111 MBs. CPU usage is under 3 one core at all times. Same computer, same disk, same everything.p  pIt also appears that Windows loads 8 pages into the buffer cache at a time, although only one page is actually created. Faulting every 8th page runs at the same speed and loads the same amount of data from disk, but shows lower physical memory and system cache metrics and only 18 of the page faults. Subsequent reads prove that the pages are nevertheless definitively in the buffer cache no delay, no disk activity.p  pPossibly very, very distantly related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5257019memorymappedfileisfasteronhugesequentialreadwhyMemoryMapped File is Faster on Huge Sequential Readap  pTo make it a bit more illustrativebr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQg8v5.png altenter image description herep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pUsing codeFILEFLAGSEQUENTIALSCANcode seems to somewhat balance reads of 128k, improving performance by 100. On the other hand, it emseverelyem impacts reads of 512k and 256k you have to wonder why and has no real effect on anything else. The MBs graph of the smaller blocks sizes arguably seems a little more even, but there is no difference in runtime.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1YJLb.png altenter image description herep  pI may have found an explanation for smaller block sizes performing better, too. As you know, asynchronous requests may run synchronously if the OS can serve the request immediately, i.e. from the buffers and for a variety of versionspecific technical limitations.p  pWhen accounting for emactualem asynchronous vs. immediate asyncronous reads, one notices that upwards of 256k, Windows runs every asynchronous request asynchronously. The smaller the blocksize, the more requests are being served immediately, emeven when they are not available immediatelyem i.e. ReadFile simply runs synchronously. I cannot make out a clear pattern such as the first 100 requests or more than 1000 requests, but there seems to be an inverse correlation between request size and synchronicity. At a blocksize of 8k, every asynchronous request is served synchronously.br Buffered synchronous transfers are, for some reason, twice as fast as asynchronous transfers no idea why, hence the smaller the request sizes, the faster the overall transfer, because more transfers are done synchronously.p  pFor memory mapped prefaulting, FILEFLAGSEQUENTIALSCAN causes a slightly different shape of the performance graph there is a notch which is moved a bit backwards, but the total time taken is exactly identical again, this is surprising, but I cant help it.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pUnbuffered IO makes the performance graphs for the 1M, 4M, and 512k request testcases somewhat higher and more spiky with maximums in the 90s of GBs, but with harsh minumums too, the overall runtime for 1GB is within  0.5s of the buffered run the requests with smaller buffer sizes complete significantly faster, however, that is because with more than 2558 inflight requests, ERRORWORKINGSETQUOTA is returned. Measured CPU usage is zero in all unbuffered cases, which is unsurprising, since any IO that happens runs via DMA.p  pAnother very interesting observation with codeFILEFLAGNOBUFFERINGcode is that it significantly changes API behaviour. codeCancelIOcode does not work any more, at least not in a sense of emcancelling IOem. With unbuffered inflight requests, codeCancelIOcode will simply block until all requests have finished. A lawyer would probably argue that the function cannot be held liable for neglecting its duty, because there are no more inflight requests left when it returns, so in some way it has done what was asked  but my understanding of cancel is somewhat different.br With embufferedem, overlapped IO, codeCancelIOcode will simply cut the rope, all inflight operations terminate immediately, as one would expect.p  pYet another funny thing is that the process is emunkillableem until all requests have finished or failed. This kind of makes sense if the OS is doing DMA into that address space, but its a stunning feature nevertheless.p

Negative 965 pI am working on a rudimentary handcoded lexical scanner and wish to support UTF8 input its not 1970 anymore. Input characters are read from codestdincode or a file one at a time and pushed into a buffer until whitespace is seen, etc. I thought about writing my own wrapper for codefgetccode that would instead return codechar[]code of bytes that make up the UTF8 character and work with the result as a string... itd be easy enough, but would become a slipperyslope. Id rather not waste time reinventing the wheel and instead use an existing, tested library like a hrefhttpicuproject.org relnofollowICUa. And so now I have a nonUTF8 supporting code that works with codefgetccode, codeisspacecode, codestrcmpcode, etc. which I am trying to update to use ICU. This is my first foray with ICU and have been reading through the documentation and trying to find usage examples with Google code search, but there are still some points of confusion Im hoping someone will be able to clarify.p  pThe codeufgetccode function returns codeUCharcode, and codeufgetcxcode returns codeUChar32code... the documentation recommends using codeufgetcxcode to read codepoints, so thats what Im starting with. Im keeping the same approach as above, but Im pushing codeUChar32codes into a buffer instead of codecharcodes. p  ul lipWhat is the proper way to compare a character against a known value Originally I was able to do codeif c  code to check if the plussign was fetched from the input. GCC doesnt complain when codeccode is a codeUChar32code which is then a comparison between codeUChar32code and codecharcode but is this really properpli lipI was able to use codestrcmpcode to compare the buffered characters with a known value, for example codeif strcmpbuf, else  0code. There is codeustrcmpcode provided by ICU and I think I may need to use the codeUSTRINGDECLcode and codeUSTRINGINITcode macros to specify the known literal, but I am not certain. The documentation shows they result in codeUChar[]code, though I assume I need codeUChar32[]code... and Im uncertain how to use them correctly anyway. Any guidance here would be welcomed.pli lipAfter reading in a series of numeric characters I have been converting them with codestrtolcode so I can work with them. Is there a similar function made available by ICU since I am converting codeUChar32[]code nowpli ul

Negative 965 pI have a fairly involved download process I want to perform in a background thread.  There are some natural dependencies between steps in this process.  For example, I need to complete the downloads of both Table A and Table B before setting the relationships between them Im using Core Data.p  pI thought first of putting each dependent step in its own NSOperation, then creating a dependency between the two operations i.e. download the two tables in one operation, then set the relationship between them in the next, dependent operation.  However, each NSOperation requires its own NSManagedContext, so this is no good.  I dont want to save the background context until both tables have been downloaded and their relationships set.p  pIve therefore concluded this should all occur inside one NSOperation, and that I should use notifications or some other mechanism to call the dependent method when all the conditions for running it have been met.p  pIm an IOS noob, however, so before I venture down this path, I wouldnt mind advice on whether Ive reached the right conclusion.p  pThanks in advance, Waynep

Negative 965 pstrongSee Updates in the end strongp  pThe current codebase has 1.4k line of purely procedural code which sends sms has business logic, db connectivity, and everything in one gigantic codeifcode conditional nested with countless more codeifcodes, no functions, full of literals, a genuine DailyWTF candidate. And I have decided to bite the bullet and rewrite the whole damn thing from scratch.br The thing is, this will be my first OOP experience. I read as much as I can about OOD and good practices and decided to start with something simple. I want to implement sendreceive of Messages primarily textSMS, but MMS, email are to be incorporated in future.

I feel that the codeifcodes shouldnt be there, right Perhaps they are necessary for codesetContentcode but what about codesendMessagecode  So I thought I will separate the sending part into its own codeclass SendMessage implements SendMessageInterfacecode. which will have its own variables for codeserver, protocolcode and methods for sending emailtext etc. But while writing that class, I realized those codeifcodes are creeping again as codeifmsggtgetType  textcode conditionals. To add to that, I am creating a new class which separates the emactionem part of my emobjectem which is confusing to me e.g. codeclass doorcode should be responsible for implementing codeclosecode and codeopencode methods.  p  pNow either I accept that the codeifcodes will always be there which feels like defeating the whole purpose of polymorphism or I emmust be doing something wrongem.br From a users perspective, I am imagining something like   p  precodemsg  new Message msggtsetTypeemail or text or mms etc. msggtsetContentcontent e.g. contentarraysubjectgtfoo,bodygtbar msggtsendMessage if the last line is not possible, then perhaps sender  new SendMessagemsg sendergtsend codepre  pwhat am I missing here is it impossible to achieve codemsggtsendMessagecode Willshould I need different emMessageem classes codeMessageEmailcode,codeMessageTextcode etc.  Should I separate codeSendMessagecode and perhaps have codemsggtsendMessagecode call it  p  pand this is when I havent even thought about emreceiving Messageem  God help me   hr  Update 15th Aug 2011  After thinking about all the aspects of current code base I have identified following parts which I will need to implement.p  precodea.

I just need to write a wrapper codepublic function sendcode around codeprivate function sendPDU,SMcode methods.  p  pWhile I was thinking about integrating GatewaySMPP I realized that I will be openingclosing sockets for SMPP connection for each Message send operation. This is fine for exercisetesting, but in practice I think I may need to change my logic so that emexisting connection is used.em strongQuestion is howstrong Here is current logic in orderp  precodeclass GatewaySMPP      private socket,port,host etc.     public function constructhost,port,user,passwd          thisgtsocket  FALSE         thisgthost  host initialize other private variables          public function init          ifthisgtsocket  FALSE return FALSE socket already in use         thisgtsocket  fsockopenthisgthost, thisgtport ...         prepare bind statement for initiating SMPP connection and fwrite to socket         thisgtsendPDUBIND, data          public function sendreceiver, sender, message, ...          use private functions which do actual socket operations         thisgtsendSMreceiver, sender, message, ...          public function end          ifthisgtsocket  FALSE return socket already closed         thisgtsendPDUUNBIND,  omitting response check         result  fclosethisgtsocket omitting response check      codepre  pQ. The problem I am facing is, each object of GatewaySMPP will have its own socket, so I thought about making GatewaySMPP singleton emshuddersem or using some globalstate variable to keep track of sockets for reuse. A better idea that comes to my mind is if the consumer of these classes uses following logic. 1. Create and use single codeobjGatewaySMPPcode for all codeobjectMessage[]code 2. codeobjGatewaySMPPgtinitcode 3. codeforeachobjMessage[] as msg msggtsendcode 4. codeobjGatewaySMPPgtendcode. That still leaves the problem of concurrent calls by different users of the class Suggestionscomments please.p
Negative 965 pI have some nonreserved keywords Im matching with rules likep  precodekFOO  self.input.LT1.text.lower  foo ID codepre  pWhere the codeIDcode token is a standard alphanumeric string.

Negative 965 pI often use R to analyze data, and really enjoy Notepad along with NppToR. Especially, NppToR enables to run a part of code without much hassle. I just highlight a snippet of R code to run and press F8. Then the code magically runs in R console.p  pNow, I am required to use python to analyze data. I know that ipython is great to work interactively, but it is always very annoying to copy a snippet of python code and manually paste that into ipython console. Also, indentation is often mixed and thus the entire lines are failed to run. Note that I want to run selected lines of codes, not the entire file.p  pSo I am looking for a programpluginmacro similar to NppToR, but working with pythonipython console. I have searched the web, but couldnt find such one. Some plugins are nice, but not exactly what I want. For example, Python Script enables extending Notepad itself, but not outside. Various other Run extensions enables the entire file to be run in python.p

Negative 965 pWhat would be the best way to create unit tests for testing the parameters I send to my WCF servicep  pI have a project where I have a repository class that speaks to my WCF service.

In the example above it would be kind of pointless since I only send the customerId just as it is passed in, but in my real code there are more parameters and some more logic in the repository class.p  pstrikeThe problem is that the generated service client class MyWCFServiceClient doesnt have an interface and so I cant mock it in my tests or am I wrong about that.strikep  pstrongEdit I was wrong about this. There is an interface See my answer below.strongp  pOne solution would be to have a class that wraps the service client and that only resends the parameters and returns the resultp  precodepublic class ClientProxy  IClientProxy      public MyWCFServiceCustomer GetCustomerint customerId              var client  new MyWCFServiceClient         return client.GetCustomercustomerId       public interface IClientProxy      MyWCFServiceCustomer GetCustomerint customerId  codepre  pThat way I could give that class an interface and thus mock it.

Negative 965 pI wonder if it is possible to swap the top two locations on the .net IL stack without using nonstack storage. It is the sort of thing that stack machines can often do, but there does not appear to be an obvious instruction for that in IL.p  pThe reason is that I need to calculate something a bit like f x  f y. The x and y are the top two locations on the stack, and f has an IL implementation. This is trivial to do with intermediate storage but that is probably both slower and less convenient than if there was a swap.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 965 pIm attempting to implement a text clustering algorithm. The algorithm clusters similar lines of raw text by replacing them with regexes, and aggregates the number of patterns matching each regex so as to provide a neat summary of the input text instead of showing repetitive patterns from the input text. In this attempt I ran into the need to find if one regex covers another.p  pAssume we are concerned emonlyem about regular expressions with  and  wild cards i.e.  meaning zero or more occurences of an alphabet, and  meaning 1 or more occurences of an alphabet. Also assume the character set to be ASCII.p  pFor examplep  precode1. AB covers AB       This is straightforward. 2. ABC covers ABC       Because ABC can generate ABC, ABCC, ABCCC etc. 3. ABC covers ABC       Because ABC can generate ABBC, AABBC, AABBCC etc. which covers       all strings generated by ABC. 4. AMBC covers AMMBCMBC       Similar to case [3] above. codepre  pBasically Im looking for an efficient implementation of the following method which tells if strA may contain a regex covers for strB may contain a regex. Note that there should also be a way to escape the regex characters  and  in the input strings strA and strB.p  pMethod signature in Cp  precodebool isParentRegexconst stringamp strA, const stringamp strB codepre  pMy thinking is that a recursive approach is required for the implementation and it may be a bit complicated.

Negative 965 pI have a table with a field loginStatus. Now everytime a user logs in, the value is set to 1 and after clicking on logout the value is set to 0. Now when a user tries to log in, the value of that field is checked, If it is 0 then the user can log in, if it is 1 then the user cannot login. Now if by any mean the browser is closed, the user cannot login with that userID. Because the value of that field is still 1he hasnt clicked the logout button so it is not changed. My application is running fine unless the user closes the browser. p  pI know this issue can be solved differently but I have been asked to do it this way. Now the problem is I am not that much pro in Java EE so multiple help with explanations are exactly what I am looking for.p  pAlso I have a possible solution which is like  creating a database trigger to change the loginStatus value to 0 which will be triggered after, say 15 mins, as the user logs in. Now I also dont know how to create that kind of trigger that will trigger after specific time.p

Negative 965 pI have created a shutdown.py script that shuts down my computer when executed. I have also created a rule in Microsoft Outlook that executes my Python script when I receive an email that has BLAHBLAHBLAH in the subject. I have tested it out and it works flawlessly however, my question for you all is is it possible to pass the emails subject line into the Python script before executing it Basically, I want to have a keyword in the subject line that will execute a certain script but also be able to pass parameters into the emails subject line that the Python script will then use. For example if I sent shutdown30 my python script would be able to parse the string shutdown30 and use the 30 as a parameter to shutdown the computer in 30 minutes. p  pThanks in advance for any advicecommentssuggestionsanswers p

Negative 965 pSublime Text 2 comes with many builtin completionstemplates for common idioms. In C, these include for loops with fields, etc  if I wrote codeveccode and pressed tab, it would expand to codestdvectorltfieldgt vcode where field is a writeable field.

Negative 965 pI am new to WPF and the MVVM design pattern this month, and more than a little out of practice in general.  To learn, Ive been playing around with textboxes, rectangles, and ways to display them in a window.  I began with Ashley Davis excellent Simple Drag Selection in WPF tutorial, which walks through creating a view model for a collection of rectangles, binding a listbox to said collection, and styling the listbox with a canvas, creating a data template for the rectangles, as well as basic rubber band selection logic.p  pI have since built on this tutorial to improve the drag selection so that it behaves much more like selection does in windows explorer, and to allow resizing the rectangles from the corners or edges.p  pAll was well until I changed the MainWindow.xaml in an effort to include a column on the side for various buttons and controls, thus moving the editor surface grid from inside a 1x1 grid on the main window to a column of a 1x2 grid, moving the data template to the grids resources since it will be the only element in the window that needs it. As soon as I did this, subroutines that I wrote which interact with the listbox started misbehavingrubber band selection no longer works.  Theres no visual indication that listbox items are being selected they were highlighted previously, and interrogating listBox.SelectedItems.Count after a dragselection mouseUp event returns a zero.p  pAfter some experimentation, reading many questions on this site and sections of my WPF Unleashed book, and going over the msdn databinding overview, as of this morning I still cannot find my mistakes.  I believe it is a data binding mistake or incorrect data context.p  pSome details about the view models involved p  pDataFieldViewModel p  p...implements INotifyPropertyChanged and exposes properties for its in this case a rectangle and a textbox X,Y position, width, height, visibility, and selection status a way to track it across several rubber band selection operationsp  pPageViewModelp  p...implements INotifyPropertyChanged, and has among other things an ObservableCollection of type DataFieldViewModel, called DataFields, and exposes it as a ReadOnly Property.p  pHeres a look at MainWindow.xaml.vb and one of the broken subsp  precodeNamespace EditorUI     The main window of the editor.

Negative 965 pAs stated in the description.  I would like to not even be prompted to resolve merge conflicts when they were automatically resolved.p  pMy Scenario is that I add a line containing a fixed text string to a text file on one branch, do some other commits on that same branch, then on another branch cherrypick the change which adds the fixed text, then do a merge with the other branch.p  pIm doing this as a test because in my daytoday i often get conflicts but when i use my merge tool it says there are no conflicts so i just close it and commit manually.p  pThe issue is that im prompted for extra steps when in reality git already merged in the changes correctly. I even checked the file manually to make sure it wasnt my merge tool doing the resolution and indeed the conflict is already resolved int the file.p  pI tried using the commit parameter to git merge but it has no effect.p  pIt seems like git fails in automatically merging the changes according to the message but in reality it actually merged the files correctly.p  pIs there a way to just auto merge these kinds of conflicts and continue without manual interventionp  pIm using git version 1.7.10.msysgit.1p

Negative 965 pI have been struggling with this kind of problem for a while now, and cannot seem to find any information or sample code to transfer some data between PHP and JavaScript.  I saw many ways to do it, but not safely. What I mean exactly is , when you transfer some variable data between the systems, it is directly shown on the viewsource window of your page, when it is loaded. What need exactly is a way to transfer the data, but silently and safely , so that it wont show up on the userside when the page is loaded. p  pSo in brief, is there a way to do this, and possible how p  pI have already tried, transferring the data with a XML file, JSON also, straight forward with echo  , or just  after the  abbreviation in php. But every way I have used so far, is displayed in the source code of the page when loaded .p

Negative 965 pIm developing a system that will build a huge ngram model for an AI project.br My pipeline is the followingbr emResource inputem  emFetch dataem  emParsersem  emTrainerembr The resource input basically URLs that have to be parsed is not constant, meaning I can introduce a bulk of thousands of resources at a time, later on another bulk of dozens and so on.p  pMy idea is to implement each step of the pipeline as a Celery task and deploy it on the cloud for instance, using Herokus worker dynos. But Im new to Celery and Im having doubts about how to queue these tasks to get my workers working at 100 and mantaining the systems integrity at the same time.br The straight forward approach is to start queueing tasks as soon as the previous one is finished, so for example if I get a resource input of 1000 items, Id schedule 1000 fetch data tasks and each one of them would queue a parse task when finished and so on. But this will lead to a huge queue because more resources will come in before these tasks are finished, and I know it will take months to build the model if it ever completes.p  pSo Im not sure if Celery can handle all of that without falling into memory issues Heroku have its limits or any other problems I cant imagine now. Or maybe I should use a more complicated technique like scheduling chunks of tasks every X minutes, storing partial results in the database, etc. which might avoid some of these problems but I wont get the 100 of my workers time.p  pAny thoughtsbr Thanksp  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe answer to my question is actually in the comments of the accepted answerp

Negative 965 pI would like to create a list or map of references in C which automatically deletes its elements upon their destruction. Here is a structure demonstrating the idea.p  precodeclass Foo  class Bar      Foo foo   void mainvoid      stdvectorltFoogt foos               Bar bar         foos.pushbackbar.foo           foos[0] should be the same reference as bar.foo            bar is now destructed      foos.size should be 0  codepre  pThere are two things wrong with my code. When codepushbackcode is called with a stdvector, it creates a copy of the Foo object. This would be unacceptable since the elements of codefooscode should reflect any changes done upon codebar.foocode. Secondly, even if the codefooscode vector could store references, the Foo object would not be removed from the list after leaving the scope where codebarcode was created. Ideally, I would like the Foo reference to be removed from codefooscode upon its destruction.p  pBefore I implement my own solution, Id love to know of any third party libraries Boost, possibly which offer this, or any proper techniques or strategies I should be using for this.

Negative 965 pI have used Style Cop for making sure people follow set code standards before but then configured it to our needs. For a few days now I have used Style Cop with its default setting to try it out and Im a bit puzzled by some things. For instance, if I declare a variable I really like to state what type it is.p  precode int foo codepre  porp  precode Bar foo  new Bar codepre  pStyle Cop wants you to use the codevarcode keyword a lot. I understand that you, the compiler and the IDE can figure out the type by the instantiation.p  precode  var foo  1  Makes foo and int   var foo  new Bar  Makes foo a Bar codepre  pWhen declaration and instantiation is done in one step its fairly visible whats going on. p  pThere are a few more things that Im not quite comfortable with that Style Cop seems to like so I basically just wanna know how common is the coding style enforced by the standard Style Cop configuration, and where does it originate fromp  pstrongNote This usage below of codevarcode is not valid as stated by hvd. Made me feel a bit better of codevarcode straight away . I leave it in since it was in the original question thoughstrong   p  pBut if you have some obscure thing likep  precode  var foo       ... bunch of code ...       foo  getLatestData codepre  pIts not obvious what codefoocode becomes. But looking at the declaration of codefoocode you wont get any smarter. Instead you have to look at the declaration of the codegetLatestDatacode function.p  pI feel that the codevarcode approach clouds everything a bit. There is no strict control like you get if you declare that codefoocode is a codeintcode. Then you know that codefoocode is emalwaysem an codeintcode. It doesnt depend what it gets its data from. Something like this could very well give you two different types of foo.p  precodevar foo  ...  ifstatus  0    foo  getLatestData  else    foo  getOtherData  codepre  pTheres nothing enforcing that the two functions have to return the same type and codefoocode can thus become different things. When you code everything yourself and its contained like this its probably easy to keep track of. But if its an API or plugin library it would be a nightmare if external 3rd party developers cold dictate the type of codefoocode since you could not be sure what to do with it in that case.p

But what about imported bindings from an external library Is it possible to override these bindings by the standard p  pOn page 2627 of the report, it says p  blockquote   pThe top level of a program may also include import declarations.   In a library declaration, it is an error to import   the same identifier more than once with different bindings,   or to redefine or mutate an imported binding with define,   definesyntax or set. However, a REPL should permit   these actions.p blockquote  pDoes it mean that redefining is only an error when it does happen in libraries for imported bindingsp  pI understand that it prohibits optimisations by compilers if the compiler does not know whether, say emem still means the builtin addition or is any other userspecified error. But from this perspective, it does not make sense to restrict forbidding to rebind on the library level, when it would also make sense at least for imported bindings in programs.p  pP.S. As this is all about the environment of a scheme program am I right in saying that environments are not first class citizens because one cannot get hold of the current environment Which, in turn, allows a compiled program to forget about the chosen names of the bindings.p

Negative 965 pDepending on the number of available pictures, i use an imageview or Gallery. When there is only one picture available, it uses the imageview and that works like a charm.

The picture is at the top of my screen in full width.p  pWhen there are multiple pictures i use a gallery, with pagerindicators. On smaller screens this works fine.

Negative 965 pAn application Im writing needs to send a message to another application to make the cursor visible.  The vast majority of my experience in programming is in C, and Ive managed to write a DLL Injector that allows me to inject managed code using CreateRemoteThread.  Inside the DLL Im injecting is a PInvoked call to ShowCursor.  This seems to have no effect however, and using a StreamWriter to check the value of what ShowCursor returns shows that while the function is successful and the display counter increments, at some other point the counter returns to 0. Which should be displaying the cursor anyway, now that I think about it.  p  pWhat important piece of information am I missing  Do Windows Forms have some functionality that prevents me from changing the cursor like this  Is ShowCursor tied to the thread its running in, so it reverts upon completion  Or is it something completely differentp

Negative 965 pWe are running mongodb v2.0.6 as a service on Windows.

As the collections in our mongodb have grown, we are starting to see failures in our services while trying to connect to mongodb on startup.  It appears that mongodb is reporting to the windows SCM that it has started, yet it doesnt appear to be ready to accept client connections at that point.  Has anybody else seen this condition  We currently have several hacks in place to get around this, but Im trying to find out if this is a bug in mongodb, i.e., is it still asynchronously initializing when it tells the SCM that it has startedp

Negative 965 pI think this is a very common problem, but I cannot find a suitable solution for me. As you all know, WP supports a dark and a light theme. The user can change the theme and there are ways to override his decision and to display everything in the color theme youve selected. However, Im just trying to react to this two theme types and I want to display icons in the correct color. p  pIf you use the Application Bar, you can select from many built in icons, which will be automatically inverted from light to dark and vice versa.p  pWhy isnt there any support for normal images For example I want to display a telephone icon. Ive picked one from the built in icons and copied it from the Microsoft SDK folder to the Image folder of my project. If the user uses the dark theme, everything will be fine because the white telephone icon will be visible on the black background. But if he switches to the light theme, the icon will be invisible because it is white on white.p  pIm fully aware of the style resources for textboxes or background colors, which use the phones accent or theme color. But why is it, that there is no support for simple icons which I added as Image to my XAML pagep  pOf course I could detect in the constructor of the page if the user is in dark or light mode. I would then load either a black or white version of the telephone icon. But this check will be done everytime I visit the page and slows everything down. Its also annoying to manually add the check for the theme each time Im adding a theme aware image.p  pIs there any solution, which will work with XAML only Or is at least easy to maintain And why cant I use the built in images from the SDK right from the beginning They are already available in dark and light versions and are already used in the application bar.p
Negative 965 pI have tried to implement the following algorithm using codeParallel.Foreachcode. I thought it would be trivial to make parallel, since it has no synchronization issues. It is basically a MonteCarlo tree search, where I explore every child in a parallel. The MonteCarlo stuff is not really important, all you have to know is that I have a method which works a some tree, and which I call with codeParallel.Foreachcode on the root children. Here is the snippet where the parallel call is being made.p  precode    public void ExpandParallelint time, FuncltTGame, TGamegt gameFactory              int start  Environment.TickCount           Creating all of roots children         while root.AvailablePlays.Count gt 0             Expandroot, gameInstance           Create the children games         var games  root.Children.Selectc gt                      var g  gameFactorygameInstance             c.Play.Applyg.Board             return g          .ToArray           Create a task to expand each child         Parallel.ForEachroot.Children, tree, state, i gt                      var game  games[i]               Make sure we dont waste time             while Environment.TickCount  start lt time ampamp tree.Completed                 Expandtree, game                    Update reset the root data         root.Wins  root.Children.Sumc gt c.Wins         root.Plays  root.Children.Sumc gt c.Plays         root.TotalPayoff  root.Children.Sumc gt c.TotalPayoff      codepre  pThe codeFuncltTGame, TGamegtcode delegate is a cloning factory, so that each child has its own clone of the game state. I can explain the internals of the codeExpandcode method if required, but I can assure that it only accesses the state of the current subtree and game instances and there are no codestaticcode members in any of those types. I thought it may be that codeEnvironment.TickCountcode is making the contention, but I ran an experiment just calling codeEnvironmentTickCountcode inside a codeParallel.Foreachcode loop, and got nearly 100  processor usage. p  pI only get 45 to 50 use on a Core i5.p
Negative 965 pI was wonderingp  ul liHas anybody already thought about implementing the webdriverinterface for an embedded Javafx 2.0 Webkit Browser or for the new QT5  Webkit.li liHas anybody some pointers on some GithubBitbucketGoogleCode projects heading in this directionli ul  pWhy This would add another crossplatform browser and hopefully could be headless with a new webkit rendering engine. Right now I am using SafariDriver on MacOSX or ChromeDriver. This kinda works, but chromedriver often bites me, when Chrome does its autoupdate and breaks the chromedriver.p  pThe project, which comes closest for a headless Webkit implementation including taking screenshots is, I think, phantomjs QT4.8 webkit  ghostdriver webdriver addon for phantomjs as a javascript implementation. Right now phantomjs has its quirks with fonts and hyphenation shy rendering.p  pTesting the QT5 browser examples, the fontshy rendering seems to have been fixed. Now I could either wait for phantomjs to catch up with qt5.p  pThe other idea would be to have Java 7 installed, which includes Javafx 2.0 and implement a WebView which can be controlled by the webdriverprotcol as well. Newer JavaFx 2.0 version contain the possibility to take screenshots of JavaFX scenes, which would be helpful.p  pReferences p  ul lia hrefhttpariya.ofilabs.com201203theevolutionofphantomjsbuildworkflow.html relnofollowhttpariya.ofilabs.com201203theevolutionofphantomjsbuildworkflow.htmla PhantomjsQT integrationli lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12769169howtofixworkaroundqtwebkitsincorrectfontfallbackbehaviorHow to fixwork around QtWebKit39s incorrect font fallback behaviora qt4.x font renderingli ul  pMerry Christmas,p  pJanp

According to the taskmanager the program is not unresponsive and you can still move the window around without a problem.p  pI tried to look in the installation folder of the service to see if there is some action going on but the explorer freezes if you open it. I also tried to see if the service would be already registered in the services but computer management also freezes if you open services. There are no errors being produced in the errorlog. The CPU and RAM usage is absolutely normal.p  pHas anyone an idea what happend or how me making changes to the service itself broke my installer on XP Thank you very much for your Help.p  pEDIT 172013p  pI only added a codeThread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture  new System.Globalization.CultureInfodeDEcode to main method of the service and to all Threads started by this service. Thats all I changed.p  pIt does not make a difference if you do a clean install or an upgrede.p  pI found out that after you kill the service and forcefully because pressing shutdown causes the whole OS to freeze restart the computer the Installer exits with an error telling me that I dont have sufficient privileges to install system services. I am in the administrator group. And the installer shouldnt use my account for installation anyway. After this the installer cancels its actions by removeing the files it has added. If you restart the computer once again and try to install the service it gets stuck as described at exactly the same step that produces the error at the first try [I noticed that throu running the installer with logging enabled as recommended by Daniel]p  pI furthermore found out that the installer does not remove the service from services as it cancels its actions after the error but removes the registry entries for the service. Ok the service is gone. The refresh yust didnt work as I expected.p  pApparently the problem isnt a result of my changes at all because the version of the installer and service that worked previously now produce the exact same bahaviourp

Negative 965 pLets say you are using a library that returns error codes. Youd like to write a wrapper for the library, and youd like to handle errors with exceptions in the code.p  pIf the library is still in development by someone else, and if the error codes may change there can be new ones, there can be deprecated ones, or some error codes may change meaning slightly, what would your solution be to handle thisp  pThis is the situation that Im in right now. In my case, the library is written in C, and were using C. The coder of the library says the error codes may change, and I have to find a way to work with it.p  pOur initial solution is top  ol liCreate an XML file that has the error codes in different categories terminal ones, input errors, and so on.li liWrapper fetches these error codes on start.li liThrows the appropriate exception by checking the category of the error code.li ol  pSo lets say a method returns error code 100, then the wrapper checks the category of the error code. If it is a emterminal errorem it throws a emterminal error exceptionem, if it is a emuser input errorem it throws a emuser input error exceptionem.p  pThis should work, but I feel like this is not the optimal solution. Id like to know how good written enterprise software handle change of error codes.p  pWhat would you suggest doingp  pstrongEditstrong I have already questioned the fact that error codes will be changing and the coder of the library says the code is in development. Its an algorithm, so even the way the algorithm works changes as its original research hes writing his PhD on that. So he says there may be different errors, or some may be irrelevant in the future.p

Negative 965 pI am building an app which will monitor the battery state, wifi connection and location data at regular intervals and will write the results in a file and later send them off to a server. On installing the app monitoring should be disabled  but the user enabling it should survive a reboot. After a lot of reading I have realized that I have basically 2 options p  ul liSubclass codeServicecode and fire it off from my activity. Set it on foreground, STICKY and what not and hope that it is not killed by android  and take care if android recreates it actually there should be 3 services so syncing between them could be messy. Start a thread in the service no need for Executors I guess and have it codeThread.sleepREGULARINTERVALcode. Wake up, collect the data write them to a file. Broadcast the collected info and display it on my activity if it happens to be running which will have registered a Broadcast Receiver. Rinse and repeat codewhiletruecode. Have  a way to interrupt thisli liHave my activity register a PendingIntent with AlarmManager  which will run every REGULARINTERVAL. I havent looked into the technical details of this approach so much  but I hope I will be able to make this PendingIntent create and run an IntentService this seems the way to go  having the Thread machinery for free as well as shutting down on its own. Some skeleton code for this approach would be welcome.li ul  pI think I have to register a boot receiver in both cases to check the Shared Preferences have already done this and in case 1 start the services while in case 2 register a Receiver for the alarm event and set the alarm manager up  that is the part I need some skeleton code.p  pSo  before I start building this  which would be the preferred approach p  pIn recap  the app should monitor some phone properties and write them to a file till the user chooses to shut it off.p

Negative 965 pI run an application can run as console app or windows service that frequently makes updated data available either through tdf data blocks, callbacks, or other means such as publishing to RedisDB channels. I will chose only one means out of the three mentioned depending on which framework to go with in the end.p  pI like those updates reflected in a Wpf frontend gui application that runs on the same machine as the core application that outputs said data. At the same time I want to be able to run the same wpf application on a client machine that receives said data on a client machine that may not even reside in the same network but connect through tcp, browser, or other means over the Internet. p  pWhat is the most optimal framework that accomplishes that and please keep in mind that I want to implement the mvvm pattern within the wpf application. The data that the wpf application will need are chart data point updates, grid updates, and other status messages. The wpf application should also be able to submit data back to the core application through human interaction through controls within the wpf application. p  pAny recommendations which layers and frameworks would most optimally solve my problem I want to stick to a wpf application, not silver light and not asp.net. I could consider running the wpf app within a browser but it has to run within google chrome not only ms ie.even the wpf frontend on the same machine as the core app can run within a browser if that is the optimal solution though I would prefer an installed windows wpf application. p  pAny recommendations and guidancep  pThanksp

Negative 965 pIm currently creating a website as part of a high school internship for a professor as a university.p  pSince he is constantly uploading new assignments, I am wondering if there is a way that I can codephpcode or codeJavaScriptcode to automatically add files inside the webpage.p  pTo go into description of my concept, there is a set file structure for the professors website. The website correlates with that file structure but every time he adds a file he has to go into the code and link it. p  pI know this would be easy with codeDreamweavercode, but I want to make the process speedy for him. I want to have it so that he adds a file to the structure and the website automatically adds the name of the file within the webpage and makes a link to download it. I know nothing about codePHPcode but I am familiar with codeJavaScriptcode, just not with integrating it into codeHTMLcode.p
Negative 965 pI have a quick question to ask.p  pIve setup a wordpress site with custom theme that has the functionality to set posts PrivatePublic where as you can guess all post marked as private can only be seen by users who are logged in, and public everyone can see.p  pHow I accomplished this was using a custom field access and each post can set this custom field to private or public in the edit post screen. Then to display these posts I run a custom loop query with a isuserloggedin conditional statement. It that statement is true I include all posts with the access fields set to both privatepublic and if the statement fails ie the user is not logged in only include posts with access set to public. I have used similar loop queries for all single page loops etc.p  pNow while this works a treat I have concerns over how secure this approach is. Thats were your help comes in. How secure do you think this is Would it be easy to trick the loop into displaying private post to a user thats not logged in Can you reccommed a better more secure way of handling privatepublic posts that can be set by a select number of users on the backendp  pideas much appreciated.p  pRob. p

Negative 965 pI want to create restart function in Android Service class, that uses MediaPlayer. It will restart MediaPlayer and try to connect again to the same URL, if some errors happen, especially IO Exception.p  pWhats the optimal way to try several retries of connection There is a possibility of making a delay between the calls. It can be done in the restart function using Thread.sleep, but maybe this isnt good, because of hanging the service. During the restart the user may want to call another station URL, so the restart must be cancelled in this way.p  pHere is the example of potential function...p  precodepublic void restart      try              this.playlistERROR               for int u1 ult5 u                      if onfalse                              Thread.sleep15000  maybe bad                 mplayer.reset                   String currenturl2currenturl                 currenturl                 playSonggetApplicationContext,currenturl2  starting play                 playlistRESTARTING...String.valueOfu              we must block retries somehow when we catch playing again                                   catch Exception e              playlistRESTART ERROR         Log.eTAG2,ae.toString       codepre  pIts possible not to do a cycle FOR in restart, and trigger new restart in the exception...

Negative 965 pIm a math teacher with some novice Java skills. About six years ago I made some applets so my students could practice word problems. As time went on, more and more of my students have had problems using the applets because of browser incompatibility I think. So this summer Ive been working to convert the applets into a Dart app. The entire project is two codetextareacodes and about eight codebuttoncodes that either display a problem or its solution.p  pSo far Ive got it working just fine in Dart Editor. It compiled to JavaScript without an error or warning and runs well in JavaScript, also through Dart Editor.p  pI copied the files to my website using FileZilla, but when I access the app on the server via a browser I tried Safari and Internet Explorer the app looks correct but none of the buttons work. That is, nothing happens when they are clicked. Im not sure that I have copied all of the correct filesfolders.  I copied everything to the server that is within the codewebcode directory. There are two HTML files, one in codeoutcode and one in codewebcode. Which HTML file should it launch from And should I just rename that file to codeindex.htmlcodep  pIve got about 40 hours on the Dart phase of the project but am about out of time to devote to this particular problem. Ive put in a few hours searching for help and related examples online, but I think my questions are so basic that there is no information available. p  pAgain, Im not a web developer or programmer. Think 50 year old math teacher.p

Negative 965 pI would like to know how to implement an animation where the user can slide one view over another using his finger. To simplify things I will post some pictures to explain what I mean.p  pAt first we have a view which has a settings icon that pink thingie in the upper left corner. The view can can be manipulated by any means necessary  including swiping. See picture 1. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Swvu.png altpicture 1p  pWhen the user presses the settings button the view slides away and reveals settings view underneath. To do this I just use code[UIView beginAnimationsnil contextnil]code adjust the main view codeframecode and commit animations. The situation looks like this settings are purple, main view is still the same colourp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compJQC1.png altpicture2p  pNow when the user decides he want the main screen back he will have to grab it and slide it back into its place. HOW Now I have been using codeUITapGestureRecognizercode which would trigger a reverse animation so that the view slid back in its original place. That was messy and the user was still able to manipulate that small section of the view visible.p  pI want the view to follow the users finger and slide and scale its way back in its place. The main view should not be manipulatable while moving. To understand what I mean you can check the Yahoo Weather app which has a similar thing going on  except that my view would also shrink a bit vertically. The third picture shows things in motionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhQiqw.png altpicture3p  pPlease provide links or code that can help me accomplish this.br Cheers, Jan.p

Negative 965 pIm trying to figure out how to resize UITextView and everything actually without losing constraints. Basically, Im trying to layout a page where most components can have variable sizes like description. I tried doing it with a simple use case where I have a UITextView and a UIButton underneath. I want to make sure that the position of the button is relative to the bottom of the UITextView.p  precode voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated      [super viewDidAppearanimated]     CGRect frame  self.textView.frame     int height  self.textView.contentSize.height     frame.size.height  height     self.textView.frame  frame  codepre  pWhat I ended up with is UITextView overlapping with UIButton. After doing a bit of research, it seems that if I replace the frame, all constraints are gone also. I tried copying the constraints over, but of course the pointer is still pointing at the old frame so that didnt help at all.p  pIs there a good way to solve a very dynamically laid out page Im trying to at least use interface builder rather than code everything.p  h2EDITEDh2  pI tried updating the constraint as suggested, but that didnt actually resize the UITextView. Did I do it incorrectly When I get the constant again, its updated, but the height isnt changed visually. I did simplify my code by adding an IBOutlet for the constraint. Still no luck however.p  precodeint height  self.textView.contentSize.height self.textViewHeightConstraint.constant  height codepre  h2EDITED 2h2  pI figured it out now. I had an extra constraint for the bottom and that was stopping me from actually resizing the UITextView.p

Negative 965 pI have a parallel code that uses MPI. The proper way to use this code is to compile from source on a PCCluster and then run asp  precodempiexec n X .application options codepre  pUnfortunately some people using this code are nix challenged who find building from source a little daunting dont ask why. These users only use the code on their own desktopslaptops.p  pFor such users I simply compile a static binary on an old enough OS with an old enough glibc that it runs on most PCs running Linux. The user can then run the code as followsp  precode.application options codepre  pSo now my question is that how can I ship mpiexecmpirun along with my static binary so that a user can do something likep  precode.mpiexec n 2 .application options codepre  pThis way they can also take advantage of multiple cores on their desktops. Until now I have been telling them to do the right thing i.e., install MPI and compile my code from source.p  pBy doing some testing I have found that if I compile hydra and ship codempiexec.hydracode along with  codehydrapmiproxycode then I can run the code as followsp  precode.mpiexec.hydra n 2 .application options codepre  pBut I am not sure if this is the right approach Will this cause any issues I am thinking of doing the same thing for a Windoze binary running in Cygwin.p  pThe other option is a VBox image with everything prebuilt but then downloading a large file becomes an issue.p

Negative 965 pIm new to this website, and to the programming world. So, please be patient with me p  pI read about the rule of three, and I understood how the Copy Constructor and the Assignment operator work. So I understood that, the default ones, provided by C, provide a shallowcopy or memberwise of the objects.p  pMy question is ... if the class has a member pointer which points to dynamic allocated memory, the default Assignment Operator, will only copy the address held in the pointer from the original object to the pointer of the object is being assigned to. But wont this create a memory leak For example, the followind codep  precodeclass GCharacter Game Character                      private                 stdstring name                 int capacity   the capacity of our tool array                 int used       the nr of elements that weve actually used in that tool array                 stdstring toolHolder string pointer that will be able to reference our ToolArray              public                 static const int DEFAULTCAPACITY  5             Constructor                  GCharacterstdstring n  John, int cap  DEFAULTCAPACITY                  namen, capacitycap, used0, toolHoldernew string[cap]                                                 int main              GCharacter gc1BoB, 5                GCharacter gc2Terry, 5                gc2  gc1               GCharacter gc3  gc1                return 0      codepre  pSo, in this code, when gc1 is created, gc1.toolHolder holds the address of some dynamic allocated memory of 5 strings. Lets say, address 125. After this, gc2 is created and dynamic allocates memory for 5 strings, and lets say gc2.toolHolder holds the address 135.p  pThe next line of code, calls the default assignment operator, and provides a shallowcopy from every member of gc1 to gc2. This means that now the pointer gc2.toolHolder also holds the address 125, and we no longer can access the memory at address 135. So the default assignment operator, in situations like these, creates memory leaks ... or I understood something wrongp  pAlso, another question, in the case of the default Copy Constructor, because it is called only on objects that dont already exist, it means that gc3.toolHolder wont get the chance to allocate new memory, lets say, at address 145 It will just receive the address stored in gc1.toolHolderp  pTo try to be more specific... what Im asking is if its the same case as above, except we just have both pointers gc3.toolHolder and gc1.toolHolder, reference the same address 125, without gc3.toolHolder dynamic allocating new memory of 5 strings.p  pLong story short, when we instantiate a class that has a pointer member variable which points to dynamic allocated memory, will the default assignment operator cause a memory leak and the default copy constructor share pointers to the same allocated memoryp  pThank you for your timep

Negative 965 pIm working with atmosphere trying to get the simple base implementation using atmosphere 2.0.3 tomcat 7.0.42 running locally in my eclipse environment also connecting from external machine to see traffic with wireshark.  The problem I am experiencing is no matter what transport I use, websocket, sse, polling, longpolling, the broadcast response never seems to get to the client and the response.OnMessage handler is never invoked.  I receive no exceptions during runtime, and I have tried with firefoxchromeand IE.  I have also used wireshark and I see a packet after the post of a chat message that contains my message response  HTTP  Continuation or nonHTTP traffic and in the packet data I can see the outgoing message to the client, so it appears the server side is working correctly.  The initial connection to server is established and the js onOpen handler is invoked as expected.p  pThe work I am doing is based largely on the atmosphere sample chat application.  If anyone has any suggestions, I would appreciate it.  Might also be worth mentioning, that I added in the actual chat handler, js, and html page from the atmosphere sample and it also does not behave and the onMessage js handler is not invoked in that either, so Im thinking it is a configuration issue. p  pweb.xmlp  precodeltservletgt     ltdescriptiongtAtmosphereServletltdescriptiongt     ltservletnamegtAtmosphereServletltservletnamegt     ltservletclassgtorg.atmosphere.cpr.AtmosphereServletltservletclassgt    ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegto.a.useWebSocketltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegttrueltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltinitparamgt       ltparamnamegtorg.atmosphere.useNativeltparamnamegt       ltparamvaluegttrueltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltloadonstartupgt0ltloadonstartupgt     ltasyncsupportedgttrueltasyncsupportedgt ltservletgt ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtAtmosphereServletltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngtchatlturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtAtmosphereServletltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngtchatSamplelturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt codepre  pPOM.xmlp  precodeltdependencygt   ltgroupIdgtjavax.activationltgroupIdgt   ltartifactIdgtactivationltartifactIdgt   ltversiongt1.1.1ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt     ltgroupIdgtorg.atmosphereltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtatmospherecompattomcatltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt1.0.15ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt     ltgroupIdgtorg.atmosphereltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtatmospherecompattomcat7ltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt1.0.15ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt     ltgroupIdgtorg.atmosphereltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtatmosphereruntimeltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt2.0.3ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt     ltgroupIdgtorg.codehaus.jacksonltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtjacksoncoreaslltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt1.9.3ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt     ltgroupIdgtorg.codehaus.jacksonltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtjacksonmapperaslltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt1.9.3ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt     ltgroupIdgtjavax.servletltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtservletapiltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt2.5ltversiongt ltdependencygt codepre  pServer side codep  precodeAtmosphereHandlerServicepathchat, broadcasterCache  UUIDBroadcasterCache.class, interceptors   AtmosphereResourceLifecycleInterceptor.class,                  BroadcastOnPostAtmosphereInterceptor.class,                  HeartbeatInterceptor.class                 public class ChatController extends OnMessageltStringgt       private final ObjectMapper mapper  new ObjectMapper      Override     public void onMessageAtmosphereResponse response, String message throws IOException          response.writemapper.writeValueAsStringmapper.readValuemessage, Data.class       codepre  pClient side Javascript has been tried with pollinglongpollingssewebsockets and all successfully connect initially and call the OnOpen handler after initial connectionp  precodevar transport  longpolling  var request   urlChat2chat,     contentType  applicationjson,     logLevel  debug,     transport  transport,     trackMessageLength  true,     reconnectInterval  5000,     fallbackTransport polling   request.onOpen  functionresponse      console.logOnOpen Atmosphere connected using   response.transport      transport  response.transport   request.onReopen  functionresponse      console.logOnReopen connection reopened    request.onTransportFailure  functionerrorMsg, request      atmosphere.util.infoerrorMsg     if window.EventSource          request.fallbackTransport  polling          console.logOnTransportFailure Atmosphere Chat.

How can I not have it fail completely if there is already that intanceid, messageid combo in the tablep  precodeINSERT INTO linkinstancemessage instanceid, messageid select ins.instanceid as instanceid, mess.messageid as messageid from instance as ins, license as lic, message as mess where ins.licenseid  lic.licenseid and lic.licensekey  ltINSERT GUID HEREgt and mess.messageid  select MAXmessageid from message codepre  pFor example, lets say the insert statement above would insert 5 rows if no rows already existed in the table.

Negative 965 pSorry if this is a dumb question but I cant find any definitive answers.  I setup a VPC with a private subnet and a public subnet.  THe private subnet has a NATd instance to route for internet traffic.  The public subnet is configured to go out of the IGW.  p  pI created a Bastion host to login into SSHbr I created Test instance on private subnet and connect from Bastion Host.  Because of the route to the NAT instance and port 80443 is allowed and ICMP, i can ping and access files on the internet.br I create instance on public subnet without EIP.  Since it has a route to the IGW, shouldnt I have internet access  I created a test security group to allow all traffic from all sources and i still cant ping or get http links.p

Negative 965 pIm working on a site with lots of third party js that I dont have much say in what gets loaded. Im trying to troubleshoot a particular issue and would like to remove all click and mouseup events. Currently for whatever reason when you click anywhere in the page in the margins and blank areas, the element inspector timeline registers 3 clicks and 1 mouseup event. The mouseup and 2 clicks are being caught by jquery, with the remaining click being caught by some other 3rd party js. In the console, if I put in codejQueryhtml .unbindcode this gets rid of one of the click events. Putting codejQueryhtml .offcode in the console, doesnt appear to get rid of any of the click or mouseup events. Im just trying various nuke options for the sake of troubleshooting. Thanksp

Negative 965 pIm starting out with SignalR and I have a situation where Im going to have a SignalR site that will be broadcasting messages to clients, but I also need an admin interface that will actually trigger those messages. The admin page will call server side methods that will, in turn, call client side Javascript methods for regular users. So Im thinking I can either set up two separate hubs one for admin, one for everybody else or I can have methods in a single hub that can only be called by the admin that will check authorization. p  pBut in addition to the authorization, Id like to have SignalR not include admin methods or an admin hub in the generated Javascript proxy classes so that Im not advertising their existence again  this is NOT the only security, I will be checking authorization. Is there an attribute or property I can set on individual hubs or on methods within a hub that will suppress them from being included in the proxy but still have them callable from Javascript I know you can set codeEnableJavaScriptProxiescode to codefalsecode in your codeHubConfigurationcode, but that seems to be global and Id like to keep the proxy for the stuff I do want the regular client to be using. p

The thing that annoys me is that before the invocation of the connections destructor, the callback we set to codeasyncreadcode will be invoked.p  pSo, my question is, is there any way to cancel the pending reading task, that is, destruct the connection without the callback function invokedp  pIf the generic description above is not clear, the detail work flow is as belowcode is attached at the bottomp  ol licodecleanupcode is called when a request finishedli listart the timer and another reading task in codecleanupcodeli liif time is out, codeHandleTimeoutcode is called, and it calls codestopcodeli liin codestopcode, do the clean work, and after it, the connection instance will be destructed.li ol  pbut, after step 4, the codecallbackcode function will be called, which is registered in codeAsyncReadcode, so, is there any way to cancel the invocation of codecallbackcodep  pcodep  precodeclass Connection  public boostenablesharedfromthisltConnectiongt,                    private boostnoncopyable  public     typedef Connection thistype      void cleanup          timer.expiresfromnowboostposixtimesecondskDefaultTimeout         timer.asyncwaitboostbindampthistypeHandleTimeout,                                       sharedfromthis,                                       boostasioplaceholderserror         AsyncRead           void AsyncRead          boostasioasyncreadsocket, in, boostasiotransferatleast1,                                 boostbindampthistypecallback,                                             sharedfromthis,                                             boostasioplaceholderserror           void callbackconst boostsystemerrorcodeamp e           ...           void HandleTimeoutconst boostsystemerrorcodeamp e          ife  boostasioerroroperationaborted             LDEBUG ltlt The timeout timer is cancelled.         else ife             LERROR ltlt Error occurred with the timer, message  ltlt e.message         else iftimer.expiresat                    lt boostasiodeadlinetimertraitstypenow              LDEBUG ltlt Connection timed out, close it.             stop                    virtual void stop          connected  false         socketgtclose          connectionmanager.stopsharedfromthis       private      ...     boostasiodeadlinetimer timer  codepre

Negative 965 pI tried to post a different topic for this but people didnt really seem to understand what I was trying to do, so, now Ive closed that one and opened this one to give more detail and rephrase the question as a whole.p  pOk.p  pSo basically, I have an application which draws an Ellipse. Now, I have a certain number of points that can be random in which I have to rotate an image and draw at.p  pUsing Maths I know that to get a point on an Ellipse based by using an angle I use the following equationp  precodefinal int radiusW  width  2 final int radiusH  height  2 final int angle  120  int pointX  int radiusW  radiusW  Math.cosMath.toRadiansangle int pointY  int radiusH  radiusH  Math.sinMath.toRadiansangle codepre  pAnd that works fine, I can locate an absolute point around the perimeter of the Ellipse.p  pHowever, now Im trying to draw an image on this point so that the image is rotated facing the center of ellipse and is centered on the point.p  pSo, to get the image rotated to the center of the point I do the followingp  precodefinal AffineTransform at  new AffineTransform at.rotateMath.toRadiansangle  90, image.getWidth  2, image.getHeight  2 final AffineTransformOp ato  new AffineTransformOpat, AffineTransformOp.TYPEBILINEAR codepre  pAnd then I get my new rotated BufferedImage usingp  precodeBufferedImage rotated  ato.filterimage, null codepre  pHowever, I cant seem to be able to get the central point of the image anymore.p  pIf the angle was 0 so that the Image was the original direction then I would simply dop  precodegraphics.drawImagerotated, pointX  rotated.getWidth  2, pointY  rotated.getHeight  2, this codepre  pHowever Im not sure how to find the central point and draw it based upon that on a rotated image.p  pI know it involves using cos and sin to multiply the original pointX and pointY by the rotation matrix but everytime I try and work out a solution it always draws completely wrong.p  pAny help would be very much appreciated as Ive spent the best part of a day trying to resolve this.p  pThank you.p
Negative 965 pI have a very small Django app, mostly just for learning purposes. I am using the inbuilt User model provided by Django. To learn the functionality, Ive created pages which allow me to create and edit users without having to go to the admin panel.p  pThe register page allows me to very easily check for things like password and email validity, as when I POST to a View, I simply use codeuserform.isvalidcode to check the fields are correct username is less than 30 characters, password less than 128, other conditions....p  pFor my edit page, I wanted to make the content more responsive so I have made use of AJAX requests via JQuery, allowing me to perform actions without reloading the page. This works great, but it does leave me with the problem of checking validity, as I am not sending the form, I am just using Javascript to pick out the queries and send them in an AJAX request as suchp  precode.getdmsedituserchangeuser, inputNameSend  inputname.val, usernameToSend  usernameID.val, emailToSend  emailID.val,passwordToSend  passwordID.val, disabledToSend  checkedVal, functiondata             ifdata  success                 errorDisplay.show             else                 savedDisplay.show                 userform.hide               codepre  pAnd this is how the associated View handles itp  precodeloginrequired def usereditchangeuserrequest      Like before, get the requests context.     context  RequestContextrequest      inputname  request.GET[inputNameSend]     newUsername  request.GET[usernameToSend]     newEmail  request.GET[emailToSend]     newPassword  request.GET[passwordToSend]     ifrequest.GET[disabledToSend]  true         disabledBool  False     else         disabledBool  True     try         userobj  User.objects.getusernameinputname         printretUser         userobj.username  newUsername         userobj.email  newEmail         userobj.isactive  disabledBool         userobj.setpasswordnewPassword         userobj.save         printstrdisabledBool         return HttpResponsesuccess     except Exception, e         return HttpResponsestre codepre  pThis all works assuming input is valid, but is there something like codeUser.checkValidPasswordnewPasswordcode to manually check validityp

If a user doesnt have Charter, he probably isnt attached to it and will be fine with MathJaxs default font. What I want to be sure of is that a user who has Charter gets MathJax as Charter, but that users with poor Charters if they exist arent punished.p

Negative 965 pI have a Windows Server 2012 instance on Amazon EC2. p  pAlthough I have been able to connect to the server with RDP yes I HAVE connected the connection was temperamental. Meaning, I would be working away when the screen would freeze and stop responding, then after a few minutes, it would give the Reconnecting attempt 1 of 20... screen and come right back  at least for a little while. p  pOther times, it would not connect at all. It would allow me provide my credentials and would display a message about Estimating connection quality... and then a few minutes later it would give me a message saying that a licensing error occurred... p  pThe thing is, if licensing was an issue, how could I have connected before And after rebooting my VM, how is it that I could connect again even if the connection dropped randomly. p  pI then tried from another computer a Windows 7 laptop and could connect, but with the same timeout problem after being in the middle of working on the server. p  pTo further cloud things, I was able to connect with no issues from my Windows 7 VM on my old  Mac. No timeouts, connection is fine etc. The three computers are right next to each other old 2011 MacBook Pro with Win7 VM, new 2013 MacBook Pro with Win8.1, and Dell Laptop runnning Win7, wirelessly connected to the same router on the same network, with the same external IP. p  pEven stranger, a simple website I setup on the server has trouble loading.

Negative 965 pI just had a read of Matt Golder et al. blog post, a hrefhttpsfiles.nyu.edumrg217publicinteraction.html relnofollowhttpsfiles.nyu.edumrg217publicinteraction.htmla p  pFrom this I got a couple of questions that I hope you guys could give some input on regarding marginal effect plots MEp  ol lipCorrect degrees of freedom The first is about choosing the correct degrees of freedom for any interaction model marginal plots. It is not very clear from the reading I have done thus far which tvalue one should work with when calculating standard errors for the marginal plots. But I guess one needs to choose according to the sample size one is working with. I have seen a lot of Rcode that simply assumes a normal distribution for all calculations disregarding sample size. So if one has a sample size of 60, one should then also chose from a tdistribution of 60p  pMoreover, should one then also correct for the number of independent variables one includes in the regression If I have 7, then the correct degrees of freedom is 60753pli lipUnequal variance when we are calculating marginal effect plots, we are assuming equal variance over the range or groups of zvalues in a y  b0 b1xb2z b3xz so first of all, what motivates us to assume equal variance, and secondly do you have recommendation of how we would calculate the standard error for an unequal variance marginal plot I have not seen this in the literature much, let alone for ME calculations.pli lipMultilevel modeling with samelevel interaction If one has a multilevel model containing an interaction term, would one calculate MEplots in the same way as for single level models I guess the answer is yes, but I want to be sure.pli lipMultilevel modeling and crosslevel interaction This is a trickier one, but given my questions about degrees of freedom and ME calculation, I would like to know how it applies for multilevel models with crosslevel interaction one calculates ME in the same way, but how does one choose correct degrees of freedom because the population varies according to level, e.g. individuals nested in countriespli ol

Also, I have never found an ideal method, so I am interested if there is one.p  pIt is particularly relevant in a program where there are a number of steps such as running tests. During normal standalone operation, if any of these steps raise an exception an error should be logged and execution should move onto the next step. However, when running in the debugger the debugger should break at the point where the exception was raised. This will speed up the debugging process as you dont need to consult stack traces and the state of the local variables will be preserved.p  pThe rest of this question describes things that I have already tried so that they are not repeated in the answers... p  h2Approaches that have already been consideredh2  h3Conditional catch in VB DLLh3  pI know that this is not supported in C, but it is supported in VB.NET. So, I can get the desired behaviour by implementing the following in a VB.NET library dont worry about the code too much, it basically wraps a method in a codetry...catchcode and calls an error handler if there is an exception and the debugger is not attachedp  precodePublic Module DebuggerNoCatch     Public Function RunOf T, U, V, W, Xfunc As FuncOf T, U, V, W, X, Boolean, arg1 As T, arg2 As U, arg3 As V, arg4 As W, context As X, errorHandler As ActionOf System.Exception, X As Boolean         Dim result As Boolean  False         Try             result  funcarg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, context         Catch ex As Exception When Not Debugger.IsAttached             errorHandlerex, context             result  False         End Try         Return result     End Function End Module codepre  pNote that there need to be different overloads for codeRuncode depending on the number of arguments in this case mine just happens to use 4 args. Also, there is a codeContextcode parameter for the cases where some state needs to be maintained between the method being called and the error handler.p  pThen my code looks something like this p  precodestatic bool DoSomething int a, int b, int c, int d, RunContext context       Now the debugger break at this point  hooray     throw new Exception Something went wrong      return true   static void HandleException Exception exception, RunContext context       Only see this when not attached in the debugger     Console.WriteLine exception.Message  Do some processing on the exception                               class RunContext  context information  not used in this example  static public void DoSomeStep      DebuggerNoCatch.Runltint, int, int, int, RunContextgt DoSomething, 1, 1, 1, 1, new RunContext, HandleException   codepre  pThe drawbacks of this approach are p  ul liThe added complexity of another VB.NET DLL in the project. li liNot as intuitive as a simple codetry...catchcode  other people coming to the code for the first time would need to dig around to understand exactly what is going on. li ul  h3Rethrowh3  pThe code note the codethrowcodep  pExample p  precode    static public void DoSomeStep              try                      DoSomething                  catch Exception exception                       Console.WriteLine exception.Message  Do some processing on the exception             If the debugger is attached throw, otherwise just continue to the next step             if System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached  true                               This is where the debugger breaks execution and shows the exception                 throw                                        codepre  pThe problem with this is that while codethrowcode preserves the stack trace, the debugger breaks at the line where the throw occurs rather than the original throw. It makes complete sense that it happens in this way, but it is not what I want to happen. It means that I need to look inside the exception for the stacktrace and then find the correct line of code. Also, the state of the local variables where the exception occurred is lost.  p  h3Wrapper methodh3  pBasically, just wrap the codetry...catchcode in a separate methodp  precode    static void DoSomething              This is where I would like the debugger to break execution and show the exception         throw new Exception Something went wrong           static void DoSomethingContinueOnError              try                      DoSomething                  catch Exception exception                       Console.WriteLine exception.Message  Do some processing on the exception                   static public void DoSomeStep              if System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached  false                       DoSomethingContinueOnError                  else                      DoSomething                                                   codepre  pBut, there are a number of problems with this p  ul liMore code. li liThings quickly become unwieldy for more complicated cases, such as when there are more parameters or there are variables local to the codetry...catchcode that are set by need to be passed into DoSomething by reference of if there are substeps.li ul  h3Conditional compilation symbolsh3  pThis is probably my least favourite option. In this case a conditional compilation symbol such as DEBUGGING is used note DEBUG will not work because I may be running DEBUG without the compiler attached p  precode   if DEBUGGING                    try    endif                      DoSomething             if DEBUGGING                    catch Exception exception                       Console.WriteLine exception.Message  Do some processing on the exception             endif                codepre  pThe problems are p  ul liThis is all a bit of a headache to manage and I would invariably not have it set when I needed it. Specifically, the symbol and the fact that the debugger is attached are not related in any way other than by me manually setting the symbol definition.li licodeDEBUGGINGcode clutters the code and makes the codetry...catchcode less readable. li ul  h3Otherh3  ul liVisual Studio setting. I have also investigated the different Visual Studio exception break settings, but I want to turn the behaviour on for specific parts of the code, not for specific exceptions. Also, this should work across installations.   li liAssembly IL. I have considered inline IL as an option to generate the conditional exception, but this requires postbuild steps with 3rd party tools. li liI dont think that global application exception handlers will do it because the exception needs to be caught and logged lower down up in the application stack.li ul  h2Update  DebuggerStepThrough and Rethrowh2  pSteven Liekens comment indicates what seems to be a good solution  the codeDebuggerStepThroughAttributecode. When this attribute is set on a method containing a rethrow, the debugger breaks at the original point of the exception, not where it is rethrown as shown belowp  precodestatic bool DoSomething       This is where the debugger now breaks execution      throw new Exception Something went wrong       return true   [DebuggerStepThrough] static public void DoSomeStep      try                              DoSomething          catch Exception exception               Console.WriteLine exception.Message          if Debugger.IsAttached  true                       the debugger no longer breaks here             throw                static void Main string[] args                 for int i  0 i lt 10 i               DoSomeStep       codepre  pThe only drawback is if you do actually want to step into the code marked as codeDebuggerStepThroughcode or if there is an exception in this code. Though, this is a minor drawback because you can generally keep this code minimal. p  pNote the use of codeDebugger.IsAttachedcode because I think its impact here is minimal and the likelihood of strange heisenbugs are minimal, but beware of using it as pointed out by Guillaume in the comments and use another option such as config setting when appropriate. p  pI will go with this unless a better way or someone raises concerns about it.p

Negative 965 pIm fairly unfamiliar with complex queries in Entity Framework 6, so I had a question associated to pagination.p  pThe scenario is as follows I have a project that I have described the data model in my own form and using T4 templates, it generates the appropriate Entity, High Fidelity Change Tracking companion entity, a complex dynamic search query entity which is used to ask questions about the associated model eg. entity.SearchNameCriterium  t entity.SearchNameType  StringSearchType.StartsWith, with a UI built around this it would enable a user a powerful search tool.p  pInto this, I have a part where pagination is used to drop down a list of constituent elements img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeS1Bw.png altWPF Styled Application When I insert something using the Insert Button, if this overflows into the next page at x number of items each time, defined in a constant  I will later move this to a setting  I use the following codep  precodethis.context.SaveChanges int offset  searchCurItemLstCriteriaSkip  1 var queryBase  this.queryCurItemLstFormContainer int idFind  newDataContext.Identifier while queryBase.Any      queryBase  queryCurItemLstFormContainer.Skipoffset  searchCriteriaCount.TakesearchCriteriaCount     if queryBase.Anyk gt k.Identifier  idFind              this.searchCurItemLstCriteriaSkip  offset  searchCriteriaCount         break       codepre  pThe rationale is the item will always be entered at a point within the DB on the current page or after the current page, so you can in theory start at the current page and move forward.p  pI just want to know if theres a better way to do this, or if this methodology works...  In case anyone wonders the combobox is used to select current item because a list would just waste space, you only ever need one item at a time, and search functionality works just as well in the ComboBoxs dropdown.  The UI elements associated to this are generated XAML through the text templates.  p  pI just want to be sure I understand the kind of impact the query on moving to the newest page could have on very large databases.p  pWhat are the performance considerations of doing a query.Selectkk.Identifier.Count  itemsPerPage  Would that be quicker in this instancep  pInsight more than welcome.p

Negative 965 pRecently I have created a form with clientside validation and serverside validation. The clientside validation is being done by the HTML 5 validation email, password, required, pattern, etc..p  pThough, for the client side validation I want to USE the HTML 5 validation but disable the standard markup of the error message, for example the bubble of google chrome with the yellow exclamation mark. Instead I want to use my own CSS error markup so I can style the clientside error message the same as the serverside error message. p  pThe question is if there is a way to achieve this No validation for the form removes the error message but sadly also removes the validation...

Negative 965 pIn my HTML app, I have a slidesbased help system.  Essentially, there are a number of slides with some overlayed buttons on them  plus the prevnext buttons.  I have all slides as sprites in one large image. I set this image as the background of the help div and then use codebackgroundpositioncode to navigate between slides.  This works perfectly well p  pThis works perfectly fine on the desktop and android tablet, however on ipad changing the background position doesnt work.  It looks like the background image is not being redrawn correctly at the new position  causing the screen to be completely messed up.  Below is the image of what it looks like after navigating back and forth between slides for a while.p  pIf another div is shown over this div and then hidden, then everything is redrawn correctly, however if the only thing changing is the position of the background image, then the screen is not being redrawn. Is there anything that can be done  Is there a workaround availablep  pstrongEDITstrong On further investigation, apparently, only the part of the background over which any other content is positioned gets redrawn.  If there is no content over parts of the background, then those parts are not redrawn.

Negative 965 pBecause the constructor of java.io.File takes a java.lang.String as argument, there is seemingly no possibility to tell it which filename encoding to expect when accessing the filesystem layer. So when you generally use UTF8 as filename encoding and there is some filename containing an umlaut encoded as ISO88591, you are basically strongstrong. Is this correctp  pUpdate because noone seemingly gets it, try it yourself when creating a new file, the environment variable LCALL on Linux determines the encoding of the filename. emIt does not matter what you do inside your source codeemp  pIf you want to give a correct answer, demonstrate that you can create a file using regular Java means with proper ISO88591 encoding while your JVM assumes LCALLenUS.UTF8. The filename should contain a character like , , or .p  pBTW if you put filenames with encoding not appropriate to LCALL into mavens resource path, it will just skip it....p  pUpdate II.p  pFix this a hrefhttpsgithub.comjjYBdx4ILfilenameenc relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjjYBdx4ILfilenameencap  pie. make the f.exists statement become true.p  pUpdate III.p  pThe solution is to use java.nio., in my case you had to replace File.listFiles with Files.newDirectoryStream. I have updated the example at github. BTW maven seems to still use the old java.io API.... mvn clean fails.p

After I ran it, it jumped to 730 megs. After I have shrunk it with 3 space ended up with 435 megs. Why cant I recover all the space I have deleted Saturday I deleted about 175 megs total and a small fraction was given back.p  pThe largest Table size is 220 megs If you add up the column data total its under 50 megs. It seems that the largest tables are the ones I keep running the scrip above. Running database shrink does not release any more space.p  pLast year the database was 700 megs, my host backedup the DB and restored it on another server using a different name. Once restored, it showed 500 megs of free space. Ran a DB shrink and got it all back. p  pI hope I entered enough data, any help will be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 965 pSay you have a Div codeidtoolbarcode, and inside that toolbar you have a Div codeidButtonHoldercode that contains 2 buttons. If you float the codeButtonHoldercode to the right and dont set an explicit width on it, is that kosherp  pIve read on stack overflow that you should always set a width on a floated element. The buttons text might change, from save to apply, and I dont want to have to adjust codeButtonHoldercodes width every time.p  pI thought about setting codeButtonHoldercodes width to codeautocode, but the browser does that by default so it seems unnecessary to set its width to auto.

Negative 965 pIn my app, I want to have an index page which will display two lists of objects, where both lists contain the same type of object i.e, same Model. p  pIn traditional function based views this is easy I define two variables, assign them to querysets, and pass them into the context to my template where I can easily access them by name. p  pIm still new to CBVs and it seems there is a lot of magic, a lot of things that are handled automatically. I understand how I can override the queryset for a ListView which defaults to all objects for the given Model, but what I dont get is how to supply multiple querysets, so that my ListView can actually display two lists. p  pMy only thought so far is to override self.objectlist to be a tuple of two querysets, but that seems like it would make my template code less clear and Im not even certain it would work. p

So, for example, if I chose Deutsch then when it gets to that page, it should say Deutsch in the dropdown menu.p  pAny ideas how to tweak this code to achieve that..p  precodeltul classqtranslanguagechooser idmqtranslate2choosergtltli classlangdegtlta hrefhttplocalhosttshirtslangde hreflangde titleDeutschgtltspangtDeutschltspangtltagtltligtltli classlangen activegtlta hrefhttplocalhosttshirts hreflangen titleEnglishgtltspangtEnglishltspangtltagtltligtltli classlangfrgtlta hrefhttplocalhosttshirtslangfr hreflangfr titleFranaisgtltspangtFranaisltspangtltagtltligtltli classlangesgtlta hrefhttplocalhosttshirtslanges hreflanges titleEspaolgtltspangtEspaolltspangtltagtltligtltulgtltdiv classqtranswidgetendgtltdivgtltscript typetextjavascriptgt  lt[CDATA[ var lc  document.getElementByIdmqtranslate2chooser var s  document.createElementselect s.id  qtransselectmqtranslate2chooser lc.parentNode.insertBefores,lc         var sb  document.getElementByIdqtransselectmqtranslate2chooser         var o  document.createElementoption         var l  document.createTextNodeDeutsch          o.value  httplocalhosttshirtslangde         o.appendChildl         sb.appendChildo          var sb  document.getElementByIdqtransselectmqtranslate2chooser         var o  document.createElementoption         var l  document.createTextNodeEnglish         o.selected  selected         o.value  httplocalhosttshirts         o.appendChildl         sb.appendChildo          var sb  document.getElementByIdqtransselectmqtranslate2chooser         var o  document.createElementoption         var l  document.createTextNodeFranais          o.value  httplocalhosttshirtslangfr         o.appendChildl         sb.appendChildo          var sb  document.getElementByIdqtransselectmqtranslate2chooser         var o  document.createElementoption         var l  document.createTextNodeEspaol          o.value  httplocalhosttshirtslanges         o.appendChildl         sb.appendChildo         s.onchange  function  document.location.href  this.value lc.style.displaynone  ]]gt ltscriptgt codepre  pEDIT Changes after Joes comment below.

Negative 965 pIm trying to write the code for a dynamically sized tabled in Ruby on Rails using Prawn gem. Essentially, this table checks if certain info is to be displayed, and if so, will change its rowscells accordingly. There is also static rowscells such as headers in this table which will be hardcoded. The dynamic data will be checked if it exists via a for each loop but I dont know where to code that foreach loop. My code with the strongwrongstrong syntaxp  precode    tabledata  [[PrawnTableCellText.new pdf, [0,0], content gt Title, align            gt center, inlineformat gt true, size gt 12],                   object.objectProperties.each do f                     [PrawnTableCellText.new pdf, [0,0], content gt f.getSpecificProperty, align gt center, inlineformat gt true, size gt 12]                     end                 ] codepre  pObviously, ruby does not allow the foreach loop placed within the tabledata because that is just syntactically wrong I just wrote it there to give you an understanding of what I am trying to achieve.  My question is how can I work around this Where should I check if those properties exist and how would I create and append the corresponding cells that depend upon the existence of the propertiesp

Negative 965 pBasically I am trying to create a promise queue in angular that works kind of like codeq.allcode does, except that it allows me to push more promises onto the array strongafterstrong codeq.allcode has been executed for example.p  pTo try and explain better, imagine giving a function a single promise for which you want to execute some code for codethencode. However while you are waiting for this first promise to resolve, you give a second promise to the function. Now I dont want codethencode being called until both have completed similar to codeq.allcode. If the first promise completes before the second is provided, the codethencode function would be called twice. This should work for an arbitrary number of promises.p  pEssentially you end up with a promise queue, that executes codethencode once for every time the queue has been emptied i.e. all currently provided promises have been resolved. Im sure I could figure out a nice way to do this, just seeing if anyone in SO town has already implemented something, or there is an easy option I am missing.p

Which kv store can provide best random read performance It need to reduce disk access to only 1 time per query and all of the data index will be stored in memory.p  pRedis is fast but its too expensive to store 1 TB data in memory. LevelDB reads disk several times per query. The closest one I found is fatcache but its not persistent. Its an SSDbacked memcached.p  pAny suggestionsp
Negative 965 pI liked the deprecation approach of jquery 1.9. first, they deprecates methods and then removed them in next version. For, backward compatibility, they provide migration plugin.p  pSimilar approach could be apply in java as well by removing deprecated methods and providing migration jar for backward compatibility.p  pThis way, use of deprecated methods in new projects will be minimized and developers dont need to check whether method in the api is deprecated or not.p  pBut, java dont follow it. So, is there any flaw in the approachp

Negative 965 pI have been looking at options to ship logs from Windows, I have already got logstash set up, and I currently ship logs from Linux CentOS servers to my ELK stack using the logstashforwarder and ssl encryption.p  pFor compliance reasons encryption is pretty much essential in this environment.p  pI was hoping to use logstashforwarder in Windows as well, but after compiling with Go I ran in to issues shipping Event Logs, and I found some people saying that it wasnt possible because of file locking issues, which the logstashforwarder people appear to be working on, but I cant really wait.p  pAnyway, eventually I found out that nxlog seems to be able to ship logs in an encrypted format using ssl, Ive found a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25294127usingssltoshipfromnxlogtologstashfewa a hrefhttpwww.ragingcomputer.com201402logstashelasticsearchkibanaforwindowseventlogs relnofollowpostsa a hrefhttpwww.ragingcomputer.com201402logstashelasticsearchkibanaforwindowseventlogs relnofollowabouta a hrefhttpeverythingshouldbevirtual.comhighlyavailableelkelasticsearchlogstashkibanasetup relnofollowsimilara a hrefhttpsysxfit.comblog20130718loggingwithlogstashpart3 relnofollowtopicsa and while Ive learned quite a bit about how to ship the logs across and how to set up nxlog, I am still at a loss with how to set up logstash to accept the logs so I can process them.p  pIve asked in the nxlog and logstash irc channels, and got some confirmation in nxlog that it is possible, no further information on how it should be configured.p  pAnyway, I have taken the crt file created for use with my logstashforwarder I will create a new one if needed when I am happy that this will work and renamed it with a pem extension, which I believe should work as it is readable in ASCII format.

Then it simply flips the flag to true for the item that fired the event. I know this isnt the best way but my lack luster knowledge of knockout is forcing me down this path..even though this method doesnt work atm. Can anyone shed light on what i am doing wrong or how to properly wire this upp  pThe html for the tablep  precode                lttable classaccountGroups information idtblAccountGroupsgt                 lttrgt                     lttd width125px stylefontweight boldgtStandardAccountNolttdgt                     lttd width125px stylefontweight bold textalign centergtPrimarylttdgt                     lttd stylefontweight boldgtEffective Datelttdgt                     lttd stylefontweight boldgtEnd Datelttdgt                     lttd stylefontweight boldgtRemovelttdgt                 lttrgt                 lt ko foreach NewAccountGroupDetailsgt                 lttr idModel.NewAccountGroupDetails[0].AccountGroupName classacctgrprowgt                     lttdgt                         ltdivgt                             ltinput stylewidth 100 databindvalue StandardAccountNo, attr name NewAccountGroupDetails[  index  ].StandardAccountNo gt                         ltdivgt                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         ltdiv styletextaligncentergt                             ltinput stylewidth100 typeradio databindvalue IsPrimary, attr name NewAccountGroupDetails[  index  ].IsPrimary, click parent.markIsPrimary gt                         ltdivgt                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         ltdivgt                             ltinput stylewidth125px classdatepicker databindvalue EffectiveDate, attr name NewAccountGroupDetails[  index  ].EffectiveDate readonlyreadonly gt                         ltdivgt                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         ltdivgt                             ltinput stylewidth125px classdatepicker databindvalue EndDate, attr name NewAccountGroupDetails[  index  ].EndDate readonlyreadonly gt                         ltdivgt                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         ltdiv styletextaligncentergt                             ltinput typecheckbox databindchecked markedForDeletion, attr name NewAccountGroupDetails[  index  ].MarkedForDeletion gt                         ltdivgt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt                 lt ko gt             lttablegt codepre  pThe JS below powers the pagep  precodeVIEW MODEL FOR KNOCKOUT var Detail  function       this.StandardAccountNo  ko.observable     this.IsPrimary  ko.observablefalse     this.EffectiveDate  ko.observableformattedDatenew Date     this.EndDate  ko.observableformattedDatenew Date     this.markedForDeletion  ko.observablefalse   var ViewModel  function       var rawList  Html.Rawnew System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer.SerializeModel.NewAccountGroupDetails     this.NewAccountGroupDetails  ko.observableArrayconvertJSONToKoObservableObject.parseJSONrawList     this.NewAccountGroupDetails.pushnew Detail      this.deleteMarkedItems  function           this.NewAccountGroupDetails.removefunction item              return item.markedForDeletion                    this.markIsPrimary  function           for i  0 this.NewAccountGroupDetails.length gt 0 i              this.NewAccountGroupDetails[i].IsPrimaryfalse                  return item.IsPrimarytrue           this.addNew  function           this.NewAccountGroupDetails.pushnew Detail          .datepicker.eachfunction i, obj              obj.datepicker changeYear true, changeMonth true                  ko.applyBindingsnew ViewModel  function convertJSONToKoObservableObjectjson      var ret  []     .eachjson, function i, obj          var newOBJ           for prop in obj              newOBJ[prop]  ko.observableobj[prop]                  ret.pushnewOBJ           return ret  codepre  pOnce i have the page working the way i want it to, ill look into syntax improvements such as ko mapping library for the array.p

Negative 965 pI have been making some test processes which execute queries on a netezza database. I was just wondering if there is a way to get back any output such as rows updated, or how to catch any error messages.

Negative 965 pI have a problem with Internet Explorer and Firefox Chrome is able to handle it well. I have a html index file, that displays a datatablejquery plugin via onclickajaxrequest to a php file, that interacts with the db and gets the data. I then added some sort of messageboardfeatures One column in the table features an icon you can click on. Clicking on it opens a little form field, where you can write something about the specific entryrow. Clicking on a second icon will display all comments made to that specific tableentry. Inserting and displaying to and from the db works great  however i have a problem with the display of the form in IEFFp  pThe table is quite long and features a lot of entries. When im in the middle of the table, click on the formwritingicon and the form opens up, IE and FF will just jump to a different location in the table. Same happens, if i close the form again via clicking on the reset or submit button. It just jumps to wherever in the table and its very inconvenient to use it this way, because you have to seek out the entry again.

Negative 965 pI just got to the bottom of a very weird issue.  I noticed when I access certain pages on my website, then looked at my server, it was like I clicked on the page twice, or three times.  I could not figure out why the page was somehow getting submitted twice, until I looked at my logs.  The ip address of the duplicates were coming from 66. not my server.  Knowing that any 66. ip address is google, somehow they were watching what I clicked on, then accessing the same url themselves maybe to add to their index.p  pI was using Chrome, and do use Google Analytics on the page, so not sure which one is spying on me, but it really sucks as it doubles the load on the server, and corrupts the data.  Interesting thing is I put a nofollownoindex in the page header, because it is a temporary page, but doesnt seem to help.p  pI switched the GET to a PUT, and the issue goes away.  I know I probably should be using PUT for the page anyway, but sometimes GET is required for doing funky things with the referer header.p  pI have other similar unique GET pages, but Google doesnt seem to spy on those ones, so not sure what was special in this page.  It also only started occurring recently...p  pHas anyone else seen anything like this, or know anything more on itp  phttpaccess logp  precode174.114.6.xx   [17Dec2014122503 0800] GET chatproxy2915218875835493111ampinputhiampsubmitSendampspeakonampemoteNONEampactionampdebugLevelINFO HTTP1.1 200 18612 174.114.6.xx   [17Dec2014122503 0800] GET scriptssdk.js HTTP1.1 304  174.114.6.xx   [17Dec2014122503 0800] GET speechcmurmshsmmhithere.wav HTTP1.1 206 26604 66.249.89.90   [17Dec2014122504 0800] GET chatproxy2915218875835493111ampinputhiampsubmitSendampspeakonampemoteNONEampactionampdebugLevelINFO HTTP1.1 200 18834 66.249.89.92   [17Dec2014122505 0800] GET chatproxy2915218875835493111ampinputhiampsubmitSendampspeakonampemoteNONEampactionampdebugLevelINFO HTTP1.1 200 19084 codepre

If I dont do this, then the RESTAdapter will request from codelocalhostapicode.p  pI have a problem when I navigate to codelocalhostmyappcode and follow a linkto to a model. It ends up looking like codelocalhostmyappmodelcode which under the hood breaks the api callit ends up calling codelocalhostapicode again Im assuming because it truncates everything after the last slash and before the hash. I dont have any problems if I navigate to codelocalhostmyappcode and take the same actionsthe url becomes codelocalhostmyappmodelcode which results in the RESTAdapter call going to codemyappapimodelcode.p  pIs this a problem with how Im configuring the RESTAdapter or that Im not forcing a trailing slash when going to the app root Id like to find out how to solve this problem requiring as little adhoc configuration as possible for example explicitly defining myapp as the namespace is not optimalit could differ from environment to environment and requires custom build steps. Is there a way to always ensure that  routes to myapp or that when a hash is appended it will put  in the url if it doesnt already end in it Or is this something that is going to have to be configured on the serverp

Negative 965 pOkay I have a class project that I need some help with. Im creating an app where it allows the user to create a profile and create events once theyve registered. Its going to be done using HTML5CSS and Javascript. For my database Im using Sqlite. Im new to this programming so this may be a simple question but, how do I import the Sqlite database that Ive created into my javascript code I would like to end up being able to submit the whole form when the user clicks the Submit button. I just cant figure out how to import the database to be able to call the information stored in it... Again I understand this may be a simple question, but unfortunately for me Ive had 1 programming class so far and it definitely did not help me with importingusingmanipulating database...p

Negative 965 pIm experiencing some problems and cant find their reason. I am currently using the most recent version of GHCi portable  but to face the truth It is my first time using Haskell, so as usual the problem is probably the user and not so much the system...p  pProblems that arise includep  ul liI am not completely sure I got the difference between codelet x  0code and codex lt 0code right. I understand that codeletcode is to be used with pure functions, codeltcode with side effects IO Someone please explain that to me once again.li liI have mismatchings between types, namely codeStringcode and codeString,[Char]code and sometimes others.... The compiler tells me that codeStringcode was expected, although I clearly defined the function as codeString,Stringcode. Whats going on Did I somewhere make a mistake with the pattern matchingli liThe recursion does not work as expected i.e. doesnt work at all apparently. If someone could help me with that, I would be very grateful.li ul  hr  pHeres what I want to dobr I am trying to write a little program that implements a finite state machine accepting a word. That means it takes a set of states, one of which is the start state, a list of accepting states, and a number of transition rules. The alphabets which represent the possible input and states are somewhat implicit. I dont want to go into too much detail about FSMs here.  p  pHowever, this is how I figured a way to define such a FSM could look  p  precodeabc start [b,c] [ start,   [a,a,                         ,reject], a,       [           b,b,  c,c,  ,reject], b,       [           b,b,              ,reject], c,       [                       c,c,  ,reject], reject,  [                                   ,reject] ] codepre  pIn the first line, we have short description of what the FSM is supposed to accept in form of a regex in this case. It is only used to display it once.br The second line defines the start state, the third line a list of accepting states.br All following lines together are the transition rules. In this example, if we are in state start and read an input a, the next state is a, if we read anything else, it is reject. emI am aware that I have not yet implemented the  meaning an else and the program will crash if an input is read for which no transition is defined.emp  pSo here comes the programp  precodemodule FSM where  import System.IO  main  IO  main  do     putStr Enter file name      fileName lt getLine     description, startState, acceptingStates, stateTransitions lt readDef fileName     putStrLn FSM description   description     putStr Enter FSM input      input lt getLine     let input  reverse input     putStrLn      let finalState, oldStates  changeState input startState stateTransitions     putStrLn oldStates  finalState     checkAcception finalState acceptingStates  reads the specified .fsm file and returns   the description of the FSM first line,   the start state second line,   the list of accepting states third line,   and the list of tuples containing all states and transitions remaining lines readDef  String gt IO String, String, [String], [String, [Char,String]] readDef fileName  do     contents lt readFile fileName  .fsm     let lineList  lines contents     let description  read head lineList     let startState  read lineList  1     let acceptingStates  read lineList  2     let stateTransitions  read filter t concat drop 3 lineList     return description, startState, acceptingStates, stateTransitions  recursive function that takes the input, start state, and state transitions and computes the new state by a call to itself with the old state and a part of the input changeState  String gt String gt [String, [Char,String]] gt String, String  changeState startState []   startState,   changeState startState xxs stateTransitions  do     let currentState, oldStates  changeState xs startState stateTransitions     let newState  findKey x findKey currentState stateTransitions     let oldStates  oldStates  currentState     [x]  gt      return newState, oldStates  helper function to find a key in a list of tuples and return the corresponding value because we are not using the map notation in the .fsm file findKey  Eq k gt k gt [k,v] gt v findKey key xs  snd . head . filter k,v gt key  k  xs  checks for a given state whether or not it is in the list of accepting states checkAcception  String gt [String] gt IO  checkAcception finalState acceptingStates  do     let accept  any finalState acceptingStates     if accept         then putStrLn Input accepted         else putStrLn Input rejected codepre  pThe idea is to have the user choose a file from which the definition is loaded codereadDefcode, works like a charm. He is then prompted to enter some input the FSM works on.br The recursive codechangeStatecode then does the actual work doesnt work as well....br Finally, the sequence of states and transitions is displayed and it is checked whether the final state is an accepting state codecheckAcceptancecode.p  hr  pNow, dont try to optimize what I have written. I know, the way the definition is modeled can be improved and many of the lines I wrote can be written far shorter using some high order Haskell foo.

Negative 965 pI am trying to develop to build an application that will act as rtspserver and play rtspstream at the same time. There is an open source app a hrefhttpsgithub.commconfsipdroid relnofollowsipdroida which act as rtspserver and you can play that stream on http or using rtsp player like VLC. So i am modifying that app that it can also play the stream and act as the rtspserver at the same time. p  pBut the challenge i am facing right now is that my rtspplayer is not so great there is 5 sec delay in stream playing. I am using a hrefhttpswww.vitamio.orgen relnofollowVitamioa player. p  pSo my question is how can i improve the performance of rtsp player. Is there is any other better player which has less the 1 sec of delay in the stream player. p
Negative 965 pI need to digitally signamptimestamp a PE file EFI, actually on Linux. I found 3 tools for signing PE files codepesigncode, codeosslsigncodecode and codesigncodecode mono, but it seems none quite fits my needs. The problem is, the key is on a hardware token and cannot be exported. Therefore I have to create a certificate database, add token driver entry there and work via this DB. Only codepesigncode allows this, but it does not support timestamping. codeosslsigncodecode and codesigncodecode support timestamping, but they cannot use the database.p  pThe Windows codesignttool.execode can perform signing and timestamping as separate steps. So I thought, I might use codepesigncode to sign the file and then only timestamp it with another tool. But as I discovered, codeosslsigncodecode and codesigncodecode do not support separate timestamping in codeosslsigncodecode project its listed in the codeTODOcode file, but no signs of it in repository yet.p  pAre there some tools I missed Are there nottoolowlevel libraries which would allow me to write such program myself Preferrably, CCPerlPython. I tried to get the timestamping code from codeosslsigncodecode, but failed to detach it easily from the prior steps removing existing signature and adding a new one.p  pP.S. I also tried to run codesigntool.execode under wine, but 1 failed to get it working, and 2 Im not sure its legally permitted Im not good at analyzing EULAs.p

Negative 965 pIm new to MVVM and Im working on a WP8 app and Id like to be able to set the visibility of buttons and a textblock based on when one of those buttons were tapped. Heres my View to try and explain my problem a bit better a hrefhttpi.imgur.comJvrxBkh.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comJvrxBkh.pnga   cant post an image on this reputation .p  pWhen the user taps the Going to sleep button, Id like the counter textblock and the Im awake button to be visible with the Going to sleep button to be collapsed. Itll then work the other way once the Im awake button is pressed, etc. If I wasnt using MVVM Id just set the Visibility value inside the button event, but Im stuck on how to do this when using the MVVM pattern.p  pIve looked around and come across a solution using a converter such as using a BooleanToVisibilityConverter class and a bool property and then setting the visibility by binding to the bool value from the ViewModel and setting the converter value for the visibility to the StaticResource BooleanToVisibilityConverter. But it just doesnt work for me the way I want. Then my counter textblock has a bind already from the ViewModel so would I need some kind of multibinding for this textblockp  pHopefully Ive explained myself OK.

Once the image has loaded, it checks if the natural dimensions are greater than that of the viewport, if so it attempts to resize  this is where the script is failing.p  precode            check viewport             var viewportWidth  getWidth             var viewportHeight  getHeight              get the media             if data[2]  photo                  var tweetImage  document.getElementByIdtweetImage                 when it loads check the size against the browser size                 tweetImage.onload  function                       console.logimage height   tweetImage.naturalHeight                     console.logviewport height   viewportHeight                      does it matter if its landscape                     if viewportWidth  tweetImage.naturalWidth lt 1                          tweetImage.width  Math.floortweetImage.naturalWidth  viewportWidth  tweetImage.naturalWidth  1.2                         console.logw                      else if Math.floorviewportHeight  tweetImage.naturalHeight lt 1                          console.logh                         console.logviewportHeight  tweetImage.naturalHeight                         console.logchanged result   Math.floortweetImage.naturalHeight  Math.absviewportHeight  tweetImage.naturalHeight                         tweetImage.height  Math.floortweetImage.naturalHeight  Math.absviewportHeight  tweetImage.naturalHeight1.2                       else                          tweetImage.height  Math.floorviewportHeight  2                                           tweetImage.align  center                     tweetImage.paddingBottom  10px                                   tweetImage.height  Math.floorviewportHeight  2                 tweetImage.src  data[3]               codepre

Negative 965 pI know this is a pretty big and vague question, but if someone good give me a push in the right direction that would be great. Im trying to build a UI in the vein of Spotifys web player play.spotify.com, and have been struggling trying to get anything workable using angularuirouter and ngAnimate. The main part of the interface Im looking to replicate is the cascading panels sliding in from the left that is, how would I implement that using uiviews, when there are potentially infinite views transitioning in from the right, and I cant simply replace one view with another the previous view stays on the left side of the screen. Its tough to articulate, so this may not make any sense unless you actually use their web player, but if you have hadhave a play with it then you might understand.p  pBut yeah, any conceptual overview or hints on how I would implement this with angularuirouter or perhaps another module I dont know about would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 965 pSo here is my dilemma, Im currently storing all my records into a giant flat table that has movies, episodes, series, games etc. 70 of the records are episodes that I do NOT want indexed by the default fulltext catalog as they make up over 2 million of the records and 90 of the time people are searching for moviesseries, so I want to move these records into a separate table so they can have their own separate fulltext catalog and a few additional columns that do not apply to moviesseries season, episode  etc. as well.p  pMy issue is with stored procedure I use to checkTable if an ID already exists before I go and download data or update data for that ID.p  pI wanted to create a view of all the IDs across both tables so I could lookup in a single place if that ID exists, however when I try to union the tables it will not allow me to create an index on the view.p  precodeID          Type           ID          Type 1           movie          2           episode 3           movie          4           episode 5           movie          6           episode codepre  pThe IDs are unique and will never have duplicates in either table.p  pI feel that since this view will have over 2 million records an indexed might be important being it is called over 250500 a second so optimization is a huge factor.p  pIs there a better approach than using UNION ALL to get IDs 1,2,3,4,5,6 into a single viewp

The strange thing is that the data is received successfully. p  pIf I change the updateData top  precodeif objQueue  null      objQueue  new LinkedListltCustomObjectgt  codepre  pEach time a new queue is created and in the draw method still prints out size  0 and doesnt draw the rectangles.p  pBasically I have a listener where I get data multiple timessecond and I want to draw some simple rectangles at the position that is sent via the listener.

Negative 965 pI made a commit containing ten files recently.  One of the files shouldnt have been committed it has my local test changes that wont work for anyone else.p  pId like to check out that file from a previous commit, then recommit it as the original, then reapply my changes locally.  p  pcodegit revertcode sounds good, but it appears to be for entire commits, rather than one file in a commit.  Is there a good way to go about this while keeping the git chatterlogs to a minimum Amend the previous commit perhapsp  pNone of this has been pushed yet, if that helps.p
Negative 965 pI have a tomcat running, on which I have two residing codewebappscode, codewebapp1code and codewebapp1.1code. I am looking for a way to redirect requests for codewebapp1code to codewebapp1.1code. On top of it, I want to be able to redirect calls for codewebapp1code to codewebapp1.2code on an update of codewebapp1.1code easily.p  pCurrently I have to copy codewebapp1.1code as codewebapp1code and on update codewebapp1.2code as codewebapp1code to have it called directly. But with this technique the version information of the webapp is lost.p  pWhat I am actually looking for is a way to have just webapps codewebapp1.1code and codewebapp1.2code and not even codewebapp1code. There should be a redirect directly made by tomcat.p  pIs there a way to handle this I found several methods on the net which does not seem to work for me because I need to be flexible on update of the webapp and I dont want the redirect be made by the codewebapp1code itself like with a codeContainerRequestFiltercode and code302 responsecode if possible but rather by some other way which looks at a configuration file on the server for the redirect path.p  pAny ideas how to approach thisp  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 965 pGiven an array of codeintcodes I want to quantize each value so that the sum of quantized values is 100. Each quantized value should also be an integer. This works when the whole array is quantized, but when a subset of quantized values is added up it doesnt remain quantized with respect to the rest of the values.p  pFor example, the values 44, 40, 7, 2, 0, 0 are quantized to 47, 43, 8, 2, 0, 0 the sum of which is 100. If you take the last 4 quantized values the sum is 53 which is consistent with the first value i.e. 47  53  100.p  pBut with the values 78, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0, the sum of the last 4 quantized values 8, 8, 1, 0, 0 is 17. The first quantized value is 84 which when added to 17 does not equal 100. Clearly the reason for this is due to the rounding. Is there a way to adjust the rounding so that subsets are still consistentp  pHere is the Ruby codep  precodeclass Quantize   def initializearray     array  array.map  a a.toi    end    def values     array.map  a quantizea    end    def subtotali, j     array[i..j].map  a quantizea .reduce   end    private    def quantizeval     val  100.0  total.round0   end    def total     array.reduce   end end codepre  pAnd the failing testsp  precoderequire quantize  describe Quantize do   context first example do     letsubject  describedclass.new[44, 40, 7, 2, 0, 0]       context values do       it quantizes array to add up to 100 do         expectsubject.values.to eq[47, 43, 8, 2, 0, 0]       end     end      context subtotal do       it adds a subset of array do         expectsubject.subtotal1, 5.to eq53       end     end   end    context second example do     letsubject  describedclass.new[78, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0]       context values do       it quantizes array to add up to 100 do         expectsubject.values.to eq[84, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0]       end     end      context subtotal do       it adds a subset of array do         expectsubject.subtotal1, 5.to eq16       end     end   end end codepre

This is very simple to achieve if I wanted to search codecars.namecode. p  pId like to search codecolourscode with MATCH and AGAINST, if possible. The reason for this is so that the result of MATCH on colours can be added to the result of MATCH on names etc.p  pSo, for example, if I searched for blue I would like to see any cars that are Sky Blue or Navy Blue.p  pIdeally I would like to use text search and be able to get some kind of relevancy score, as opposed to using WHEREIN, so that when searching for blue, Sky Blue and Navy Blue coloured cars are returned, but so would a car named bluebird even though it may not necessarily have a relationship with blue in codecolourscodep  pIve tried GROUPCONCAT on a subquery, which gives me a string with all the colours in, however I cant use that as an argument in MATCH bizarrely, the error I get tells me that I have an invalid argument in AGAINST, even though Im just putting a string literal in as per the docsp  pI hope this makes sense.p

Negative 965 pBasically I positioned a bunch of buttons relative to an imageview. When I launch the app, the buttons seem to be slightly off, but not by much. However, when I test it on diferent devices, the buttons seem to be displaced into different positions relative to the imageview. So my question is how can you fix button positions relative to an imageview across multiple android devices. Ive been working on this problem for a while and I just cant seem to figure it out. If Anyone could post an example or provide some help it would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 965 pstrongContextstrong Alright, so as part of a project Ive been tasked with creating a tab  NavigatorContent which contains a File Tree that supports dragdrop reorganisation and importing. Copypasting. Essentially asking for the full functionality of a Windows folder, inside a desktop application.p  pI started, logically, with a FileSystemTree from the old MX components, and gave it the directory it needs to reference upon CreationComplete. To support native dragdrop, I added a container below it with prompts to dragdrop content. This successfully copies content into the directory referenced by the FileSystemTree, and refreshes it, displaying the new content. Gold.p  pstrongMy problem starts herestrong Ive enabled dragdrop on the Tree, and sure enough you can dragdrop items around the FileTree and reorganise them into the folderswhatever you want to do. But, because the Tree is only a reference to the directory, and not a direct link, nothing actually happens to the directory when all is said and done.p  pI attempted some lengthy, convoluted effort to catch dragdrop events and use the index of the dropped object to call emmoveToem  functions as files are moved, and refreshing the Tree at each. This emalmostem works, but it has enough issues that its moot. I can share this code if needed, but Im fairly certain its the wrong direction.p  pstrongTLDR Questionstrong Is there any previously establishedeasy way to capture the structure of a FileSystemTree and then use that structure to update an actual directory structurep

Negative 965 pI am an IT professional looking for a solution for our company. Right now we have several locations between which we have several hundred users traveling between.

Negative 965 pAll my routes have a typical codeonBeforeActioncode that requires a login and then forwards the user on to their requested route. It looks like thisp  precodeifMeteor.user      ifMeteor.loggingIn         this.renderthis.loadingTemplate     else         this.renderloginPage             else      this.next codepre  pThe problem is when my login page tries to log in a user using codeMeteor.loginWithPasswordemail, passwordcode and the login fails. Upon failing, I reveal error messages on my login page. However the codeMeteor.loginWithPasswordemail, passwordcode actually triggers the codeonBeforeActioncode to run again.  The codeonBeforeActioncode reruns and recalls codethis.renderloginPagecode and rerenders the codeloginPagecode and destroys my error message and shows a clean login page again without the error messages  thus confusing the user.p  pI actually tried to solve this by setting a codeSessioncode variable when the codeloginPagecode renders, but if I change the codeonBeforeActioncode top  precodeifMeteor.user      ifMeteor.loggingIn         this.renderthis.loadingTemplate     else          ifSession.getonLoginPage  true            this.renderloginPage                  else      this.next codepre  pThen the template goes strongblankstrong after codeMeteor.loginWithPasswordemail, passwordcode gets called and fails.  If the login is valid, theres no problem as the user gets forwarded on to their requested route, but on failure it does this.p  pSomething with Meteor and the codeMeteor.loginWithPasswordemail, passwordcode method is destroying the template and triggering the codeonBeforeActioncode again. I am calling it in the codeclickcode event of the signin button on the client, but that should be fine.p  pI know my codeloginPagecode route works and so does the error handling because if I go directly to the codeloginPagecode route which has no codeonBeforeActioncode, only a default codeactioncode everything works fine including the error handling.p  pUsing Meteor 1.1.0.3 and Iron Router 1.0.9p

Negative 965 pThe wireless router of my internet provider sometimes acts up a bit and restarting the device usually works.

Negative 965 pI am really new to all the AJAX stuff and now I wanted to convert a small homepage I created with CakePHP to an full AJAX page.p  pThe functions I use are mainlyp  ul liView Dashboard with a List of Booksli liView a Bookli liCreate a Bookli liEdit a Bookli liDelete a Bookli ul  pEach function uses its own view and should be shown in a modal. It is important that modals can overlap. In the beginning I added the JavaScript I needed to each view. So AJAX was loading the HTML view new AJAX and displayed it in an modal. I was able to click on View Book and then Edit Book, so two modals would overlap.p  pThis was working fine, but Chrome threw a few warnings because it didnt like reloading AJAX.p  pSo I decided to put all the AJAX logic into the Dashboard View and created an event handler for every possible button that could be clicked. Because my modals might overlap and I dont know which ones would overlap I created an empty div for every modal that could occur.p  pCurrently it is working fine, but what if I add way more functionality  Would I need in my Dashboard View an empty div for every modal that could show up and do I have to load ALL the AJAX functionality when the page is loadedp  pWhere should I put all the logic Do I load all at once, even though I might just use a tiny part of the logic How would I handle many overlapping modals with different contentp  pI hope you got some advice for me, because I think my solution will make it a big mess as soon as the project grows.p  pThanks a lotp  pCheersp

Negative 965 pI am combining two different classes from two different git projects to create an RTSP streamer for an iOS live streaming application.p  pemedit Agree with the 1 this question is probably a shot in the dark. But, to answer the question if I am asked why I am not using entirely the DFURTSPPlayer library Because I would rather use the YUV display with opengl of the second project, hackcam, rather than decode the video frames into a UIImages like DFURTS does. Hackcam does not have audioemp  pemAlso please comment if you down vote, at least help me find an answer by telling me what I need to refine to be clear or point out if this question is inappropriateemp  pstrongMy current issue is that the audio playback has about a 1 second latency, and is out of sync with the video which is close to real time.strongp  pI know that the audio is in sync because Ive tested the RTSP streams in VLC. Something is wrong with my implementation.
