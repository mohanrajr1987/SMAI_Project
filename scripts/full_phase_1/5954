Positive 5954 pSo, Im looking for some help, most with understanding the process of codesigning and encryption because Im still shaky on both topics.p  pemWhat I think I understandemp  ul liFirst thing needed is a KEY, which is generated using some encryption algorithm RSASHA1etcli liWith this key we create a certificate signing request or CSR something to do with X509 which holds all of our information that will be on the certificate Name, Location, Email, Domainli liBoth the KEY and the CSR get sent to the Root CA who then issues a certificate  in the form of a .pem or .p12 file using the CSR and key for generation. li liSomething about intermediate CAs and more certificatesli lipThis cert can then be used in addition to the intermediate CAs to emsignem a file so that it basically has your name on it and recipients can be assured its the what you intended them to receive.p  pemVersusem pli liSame process with obtaining a certificateli liThe public key inside of the certificate is used to encrypt the contents of the file using aes and as a result the certificate must be installed on the destination before installing the encrypted file. this seems secure but not what people would want, secret code that people cant read or decode but still has functionli liI guess it makes sense that you cant make the file entirely encrypted because it needs to be decoded to be executed on the target. Am I off on thisli ul  pQUESTION When I sign code using a certificate, does the payload also get encrypted How is this different than SSL security for a website, ensuring the security and privacy of a connection It seems like they all use the same technology to accomplish many different tasks.p

Positive 5954 pI want to have my own login system and it works, except right now I am using ws for websockets instead of wss. So a couple of days Ago I started adapting my website to use ssl so that websocket connection used for login would be secure. I however discovered the nightmare of certificates and the annoyance of browsers rejecting them, confusing long winded nonsense to get it set up on my vps and the like.p  pI do not wish to use ssl, I wondered if there are any more backdoor ways to go about securing my website which avoid having to pay money to greedy corporations yearly. I like things that are reliable and dont cost me a fortune. The ironic thing is, if I used my site with no ssl there would be no problem with notifications saying the page is not trusted and all that crap. Yet it would be even less secure with no ssl. How can I encrypt data going from a javascript client to server in a way which prevents people capturing packets on a local network, but without ssl This is what I wish to do and avoid the ssl nightmare completely. p  pOne other thing. I read that google will start ranking sights in its searches based on if they use ssl. Is this just another greedy corporate way to get people to pay for this certificate nonsensep

Positive 5954 pI am trying to configure a security domain for my JBoss EAP 6 application in which the primary means of authentication will be a Smart Card, but in the absence of the card will accept LDAP authentication.

However, the applications web.xml needs to specify a loginconfig with an authmethod. In the case of Certificate, this is CLIENTCERT, and with LDAP its BASIC. Has anyone found a way to allow both of these modules to be chained together successfully My standalone security domain looks like thisp  precode    ltsecuritydomain nameMySecurityDomain cachetypedefaultgt ltauthenticationgt     ltloginmodule codeCertificate flagrequiredgt         ltmoduleoption namepasswordstacking valueuseFirstPassgt         ltmoduleoption namesecurityDomain valueMySecurityDomaingt         ltmoduleoption nameverifier valueorg.jboss.security.auth.certs.AnyCertVerifiergt     ltloginmodulegt     ltloginmodule codeLdapExtended flagrequiredgt         ltmoduleoption namepasswordstacking valueuseFirstPassgt         ltmoduleoption namejava.naming.factory.initial valuecom.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactorygt         ltmoduleoption namejava.naming.security.authentication valuesimplegt         ltmoduleoption namejava.naming.provider.url valueldapmy.fully.qualified.domain389gt         ltmoduleoption namebindDN valueFULLYusernamegt         ltmoduleoption namebindCredential valuemypasswordgt         ltmoduleoption namebaseCtxDN valueCNUsers,DCfully,DCqualified,DCdomaingt         ltmoduleoption namebaseFilter valuesAMAccountName0gt         ltmoduleoption namerolesCtxDN valueCNUsers,DCfully,DCqualified,DCdomaingt         ltmoduleoption nameroleFilter valuemember1gt         ltmoduleoption nameroleAttributeIsDN valuetruegt         ltmoduleoption nameroleAttributeID valuememberOfgt         ltmoduleoption nameroleNameAttributeID valuenamegt         ltmoduleoption nameallowEmptyPasswords valuefalsegt     ltloginmodulegt     ltloginmodule codeorg.picketlink.identity.federation.bindings.jboss.auth.RegExUserNameLoginModule flagoptionalgt         ltmoduleoption nameregex valueCN.,gt     ltloginmodulegt     ltloginmodule codeDatabase flagrequiredgt         ltmoduleoption namepasswordstacking valueuseFirstPassgt         ltmoduleoption namedsJndiName valuejavajbossdatasourcesmyDSgt         ltmoduleoption namerolesQuery valueselect role, Roles from Principal where namegt     ltloginmodulegt ltauthenticationgt ltjsse truststorepasswordmykeypass truststoreurljboss.server.config.dirtruststore.jks clientauthtruegt ltauditgt     ltprovidermodule codeLogAuditProvidergt ltauditgt codepre  pp

Positive 5954 pI want to clarify a confusion I have related to Android app certificates used during installation. p  pIn the web, certificates are used to map a public key with domain  identity organization. The hash of the details is signed by CA, then verified by the browser.p  pAn Android app ships with a public key. Based on my understanding, the developer could use his own private key, sign the hash of the app, then ship app with his public key. This information is used by installer.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipEven if some CA was used, app would still be shipped with CAs public key  does it matter who owns the signing public key  it could be anyone, as installer will just use it.pli lipIs integrity checking the only thing android app certificate is used for  App has a no public key like a website, so certificate is not being used to associate some public key with the app. Is there any other purpose for the certificate pli ol

My requirements are that the file be copied to a different directory first.p  pSo, can I be notified of the drop operation so that I can only copy the file if operation succeeds Id rather wait till I know it needs to be copied before actually performing the copy.p  pAlso, is it possible to know what program the drop operation is occurring in Ideally Id like to alter the filepath based on who or what its being dropped.p  pThe solution to this can be in any .NET language or CC with COM.p
Negative 5954 pI will choose Java as an example, most people know it, though every other OO language was working as well.p  pJava, like many other languages, has interface inheritance and implementation inheritance. E.g. a Java class can inherit from another one and every method that has an implementation there assuming the parent is not abstract is inherited, too. That means the interface is inherited and the implementation for this method as well. I can overwrite it, but I dont have to. If I dont overwrite it, I have inherited the implementation.p  pHowever, my class can also inherit not in Java terms just an interface, without implementation. Actually interfaces are really named that way in Java, they provide interface inheritance, but without inheriting any implementation, since all methods of an interface have no implementation.p  pNow there was this a hrefhttpwww.javaworld.comjavaworldjw082003jw0801toolbox.htmlarticle, saying its better to inherit interfaces than implementationsa, you may like to read it at least the first half of the first page, its pretty interesting. It avoids issues like the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFragilebaseclassfragile base class problema. So far this makes all a lot of sense and many other things said in the article make a lot of sense to me.p  pWhat bugs me about this, is that implementation inheritance means strongcode reusestrong, one of the most important properties of OO languages. Now if Java had no classes like James Gosling, the godfather of Java has wished according to this article, it solves all problems of implementation inheritance, but how would you make code reuse possible thenp  pE.g. if I have a class Car and Car has a method move, which makes the Car move. Now I can subclass Car for different type of cars, that are all cars, but are all specialized versions of Car. Some may move in a different way, these need to overwrite move anyway, but most would simply keep the inherited move, as they move alike just like the abstract parent Car. Now assume for a second that there are only interfaces in Java, only interfaces may inherit from each other, a class may implement interfaces, but all classes are always final, so no class can inherit from any other class.p  pHow would you avoid that when you have an Interface Car and hundred Car classes, that you need to implement an identical move method for each of them What concepts for code reuse other than implementation inheritance exist in the the OO worldp  pSome languages have Mixins. Are Mixins the answer to my question I read about them, but I cannot really imagine how Mixins would work in a Java world and if they can really solve the problem here.p  pAnother idea was that there is a class that only implements the Car interface, lets call it AbstractCar, and implements the move method. Now other cars implement the Car interface as well, internally they create an instance of AbstractCar and they implement their own move method by calling move on their internal abstract Car. But wouldnt this be wasting resources for nothing a method calling just another method  okay, JIT could inline the code, but still and using extra memory for keeping internal objects, you wouldnt even need with implementation inheritance after all every object needs more memory than just the sum of the encapsulated data Also isnt it awkward for a programmer to write dummy methods likep  precodepublic void move      abstractCarObject.move  codepre  pp  pAnyone can imagine a better idea how to avoid implementation inheritance and still be able to reuse code in an easy fashionp

Negative 5954 pIm working on a sortable listview with datapaging. Ive got the listview and paging working fine, but Im struggling with with the sorting. The sorting in itself is fine I can sort by a particular column ASC or DESC, however Im having problems when it comes to dynamic sorting where the user can pick a column and, at times, reverse the sort direction.p  pMy main problem is that currently the generation of sorted and paged data is triggered both in the FormLoad event handler and in the ListviewSorting event handler. Ideally, Id want the population of the listview to be handled in one way for form reloading and when selecting a new page of data, and in another way when the user clicks on the column header ie when resorting. Unfortunately, when the sorting event is fired, the code in FormLoad is executed and then later the code in ListViewSorting is executed. p  pInitially it was merely an inefficiency that I was prepared to let slide, but now some of the FormLoad code is fouling what Im doing in the Sorting event handler.p  pSo my question is... how do I seperate the handling of these events into two groups how can I run one set of code when the page loads for the first time and when data is paged from when Im trying to sort the datap  precodeProtected Sub PageLoadByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.Load  Initilize the Sort Column and Direction Dim LastColumn As String  IfSessionSortColumn Is Nothing, LastWriteTime, SessionSortColumn Dim SortDirection As SqlClient.SortOrder Dim SortDirections As DictionaryOf String, SqlClient.SortOrder  SessionSortDirections  If SortDirections Is Nothing OrElse Not SortDirections.ContainsKeyLastColumn Then SortDirection  SqlClient.SortOrder.Descending Else SortDirection  SortDirectionsLastColumn End If  Call GenerateSortedArrayLastColumn, SortDirection  End Sub  Private Sub PagePreRenderByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.PreRender  bind array to ListView Me.lvwMSGs.DataBind  End Sub  Private Sub lvwMSGsItemCommandByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Web.UI.WebControls.ListViewCommandEventArgs Handles lvwMSGs.ItemCommand  Dim file As FileInfo  New FileInfoe.CommandArgument.ToString if the file exists on the server  If e.CommandName  Stream Then If file.Exists Thenset appropriate headers Response.Clear Response.AddHeaderContentDisposition, attachment filename amp file.Name Response.AddHeaderContentLength, file.Length.ToString Response.ContentType  applicationoctetstream Response.WriteFilefile.FullName Response.End Else if file does not exist Response.WriteThis file does not exist.

Negative 5954 pI have a codeCGPathcode in some coordinate system that Id like to draw. Doing so involves scaling the old coordinate system onto the Contexts one.

E.g. a scale of 10 in xdirection, but of 1 in ydirection would lead to vertical lines being 10 times as thick as horizontal ones.

The problem is I cant seem to get newlines to appear between log messages. The logfile stored on the server is correct, but only the first newline shows up in the email.br The mail is in Plain Text format so I tried using n and System.Environment.Newline and neither work.

Negative 5954 pMy application throws InvalidCastException in the QA environment, something I cannot reproduce in development.p  pI wish to obtain the minidump at the exception moment. I know about adplus, but I am not sure how to use it so that it creates the minidump when InvalidCastException is thrown. Apparently, it does not distinguish one .NET exception from another. May be I am wrong and there is a way. Or, there is another tool to do it. Preferably free one.p  pAnyway, can anyone advice how to handle this issuep  pThanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  ol liThe build is a Debug build in both QA and dev. However, QA runs complex scenarios made possible in the lab, which devs cannot reproduce. Hence I need an ability to make dump when running in QA.li liI can modify the code and create minidump from code. However, I wish for a more flexible solution, the one not requiring to modify the code every time an issue like this occurs.li ol  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pActually, I have stolen the minidump generation code from John robbins SuperAssert.Net Again, this is code for generating minidump from certain concrete point, whereas I need a more flexible approach in the style of adplus. John Robbins approach is create a cdb script and then invoke the cdb debugger with that script to make it attach to the process and create the dump. It does not utilize the MiniDumpWriteDump API.p
Negative 5954 pIm having a problem with my SSRS 2008 configuration at the moment.  This is how we are currently set up.p  p1 server hosting SQL Server and SSRS, no integration with sharepoint etc.  Users access the SSRS web application, and then from there they access the Report Builder 1.0 too, which they can use to create and run reports based off a reporting model. p  pThis is all done using Windows Authentication  so they login with their domain account to the web application, and then again when loading the Report Builder.  Each domain user is configured to be able to login to SQL Server rather than using a generic SSRS account, and all of the above works fine.  p  pThe way this is setup means that you can always tell which individual user is logged in and running reports  either to the website or when running reports through report builder.  This is a requirement of this application as all users will see slightly different versions of the data models this is controlled by the underlying views, based off the domain account running the query.  So Tom may get 100 rows back from his query but Harry will only get 50, etc.p  pThe Datasource is setup to use integrated security Which passes through this domain account to SQL Server.p  pMy problem comes when a user creates a report in report builder, and then saves it to the server.  When they login to the web application and run the report there  it works fine, but when they try to setup an email subscription, they get this messagep  pSubscriptions cannot be created because the credentials used to run the report are not stored, or if a linked report, the link is no longer validp  pA bit of research leads me to think that this is down to the integrated security settings, as for some reason SSRS is ignoring the currently logged on user account or cannot use that to setup the subscription.  p  pEverything works if I set the datasource to use a specific account  but then that breaks the data filtering based on user account obviously, as it would now be just using one account for everyone.p  pAny ideas for how I can approach this  Is there a configuration setting that I can play with to try and get this working using integrated security  Any helpcomments are appreciatedp

Negative 5954 pI am trying to verify something for myself about operator and function precedence in Haskell. For instance, the following code p  precodelist  map foo  xs codepre  pcan be rewritten as p  precodelist  map foo  xs codepre  pand will eventually bep  precodelist  map foo xs codepre  pMy question used to be, why the first formulation would not be rewritten as p  precodelist  map foo  xs codepre  psince function precedence is always higher than operator precedence, but I think that I have found the answer operators are simply not allowed to be arguments of functions except of course, if you surround them with parentheses. Is this right If so, I find it odd, that there is no mention of this mechanicrule in RWH or Learn you a Haskell, or any of the other places that I have searched. So if you know a place, where the rule is stated, please link to it.p  p edit Thank you for your quick answers. I think my confusion came from thinking that an operator literal would somehow evaluate to something, that could get consumed by a function as an argument. It helped me to remember, that an infix operator can be mechanically translated to a prefix functions. Doing this to the first formulation yields p  precode map foo xs codepre  pwhere there is no doubt that  is the consuming function, and since the two formulations are equivalent, then the  literal in the first formulation cannot be consumed by map. p

Negative 5954 pSo essentially this project builds a portal of testing results from various test types.  The fetching and display of results is fine however, the resulting tables are not being displayed in the correct order.  The order theyre displayed in is random, but its clearly specified the order in which the RPC calls are dispatched and I even implemented an indexing system in my panel to further assist.p  pBasically, the application consists of three horizontal panels contained within a verticalpanel.  p  pfurther explanation  new, mid, and old refer to three versions of the software product being tested.

Negative 5954 pI am trying to recreate a codeTypeLoadExceptioncode for demonstration purposes, so I have a ridiculously goofy library setup that looks like thisp  precodeTestProject gt TheLibrary [1.0]             gt ProxyForV2 gt TheLibrary [2.0] codepre  pcodeTheLibrarycode version 1 has these relevant interfacesp  precodepublic interface IConsistentThing      int ConsistentProperty  get set    public interface IShrinkingThing      int RemovedProperty  get set   codepre  pWhile version 2 of codeTheLibrarycodes interfaces look likep  precodepublic interface IConsistentThing      int ConsistentProperty  get set    public interface IShrinkingThing   codepre  pcodeProxyForV2code has this class which implements the version 2.0 codeIShrinkingThingcodep  precodepublic class ShrinkingThingImpl  IShrinkingThing      public int ConsistentProperty  get set   codepre  pSo, in codeTestProjectcode, I am expecting to cause a codeTypeLoadExceptioncode if someone tries to assign a codeProxyForV2.ShrinkingThingImplcode, since the first version of the interface has a property that is not implemented by the second version.  To prove this, I have a unit test which looks likep  precode[TestMethod] public void ShrinkingThingBreaks      try              IShrinkingThing thing  new ProxyForV2.ShrinkingThingImpl          Assert.FailThis should have caused a TypeLoadException          catch TypeLoadException                valid       codepre  pHeres my problem this unit test fails.  But not due to the my codeAssert.Failcode, as I would expect it to.  The test output looks like thisp  blockquote   pTest method TestProject.LoadTester.ShrinkingThingBreaks threw exception  System.TypeLoadException Method getRemovedProperty in type ProxyForV2.ShrinkingThingImpl from assembly ProxyForV2, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull does not have an implementation..p blockquote  pSo a codeTypeLoadExceptioncode is being thrown and although the only place it could empossiblyem be thrown is in a codetrycode block with a codecatch TypeLoadExceptioncode, the exception refuses to be caught.  Beyond that, even if I use a catchall, the unit test fails with the same error as beforep  precode[TestMethod] public void ShrinkingThingBreaks      try              IShrinkingThing thing  new ProxyForV2.ShrinkingThingImpl          Assert.FailThis should have caused a TypeLoadException          catch                valid       codepre  pWhat is going on  Obviously, this is a completely contrived scenario, but I would still like to know what is going on so that this error can be avoided at run time or at least dealt with if it happens yes, Im aware the ultimate solution is to make sure all your library versions are the same.p  pThe worst part is that emanyem access to the class at all, such as codetypeofProxyForV2.ConsistentThingImplcode or codeProxyForV2.ConsistentThingImpl.SomeStaticFunctioncode causes this uncatchable codeTypeLoadExceptioncode, so it is clear that the problem originates when .NET tries to load the class at all, not from any assignment.p  pMy only idea for mitigating this issue is to try to load the type in a different application domain so that it does not interfere and then do some crazy reflection stuff to see if the interface is compatible with the implementation, but that seems like complete and total overkill.p  pIn summary Why does it seem impossible to catch this problem in the normal way and how can I resolve issues like this at runtimep

Negative 5954 pI am dealing with large amounts of scientific data that are stored in tab separated code.tsvcode files. The typical operations to be performed are reading several large files, filtering out only certain columnsrows, joining with other sources of data, adding calculated values and writing the result as another .tsv.p  pThe plain text is used for its robustness, longevity and selfdocumenting character. Storing the data in another format is not an option, it has to stay open and easy to process. There is a lot of data tens of TBs, and it is not affordable to load a copy into a relational database we would have to buy twice as much storage space.p  pSince I am mostly doing selects and joins, I realized I basically need a database engine with .tsv based backing store. I do not care about transactions, since my data is all writeoncereadmany. I need to process the data inplace, without a major conversion step and data cloning.p  pAs there is a lot of data to be queried this way, I need to process it efficiently, utilizing caching and a grid of computers.p  pDoes anyone know of a system that would provide databaselike capabilities, while using plain tabseparated files as backend It seems to me like a very generic problem, that virtually all scientists get to deal with in one way or the other.p

Is there a way to parse blobs and use them during a query  I also suspect there will be issues with biglittleendian binary encoding with blobs. x  [primkey, blob]p  pSecond idea is to represent them as a string.  This makes it easier to read, but probably less compact. x  [primkey, 100, 1.2, 101.1, 234.3, ... ]p  pA third is to normalize and represent these floats in a separate table, with reference to the primary key.  This seems awkward, slower at gathering these floats for a particular x, and space wasteful as each float pair must be associated with the referencing primary key values.  But this will allow me to make queries using the float pairs.p  pxfloatpairs  [primkeyref, 100, 1.2 primkeyref, 101.1, 234.3 ...]p  pA fourth is to create a table to contain the pair of floats per item x probably the worst idea rightp  pAny suggestions  Thank you in advance.p

Negative 5954 pim creating a dll which needs to connect to a database file using SQLite. Unfortunately, since my dll is used as an Excel AddIn, I dont really have a chance to figure out the path of where my dll is Application references the Excel installation folder, all the Reflection.Assembly stuff is linked to either the WindowsGAC folder or something else. So long story short, I cant just put my SQLite file into my .dllfolder because it wont be found there when just using the connection string with a relative path, e.g. Data Sourcemyfile.SQLite, and I cant figure out the full path to my original dll either due to the dll being used as an Excel AddIn.p  pMy idea was to add the SQLite file to my projects resources, but I dont know how I could connect to a project resource with a regular SQLite connection string..is that even possible If its not, any other ideas how I could solve thatp  pThanksp

Negative 5954 pI am implementing a simple round robin solution for load balancing. The idea is a request would come in with a integer value and based on that value if it is within Range I will choose the correct process to forward the request. p  pstrongCreation of Mapstrongbr On startup, load balancer talks to every process and gets the supported range. Now this range can overlap another processs Range or be a subset. p  pFor example, consider the followingp  ul liProcess A supports 15   li liProcess B supports 13li liProcess C supports 39li ul  pThe initial solution I had was to create a simple codeHashMapltInteger, ListltProcessgtgtcode.

So if have to update a parameter for Process C, I have to loop through every entry of the Map, for each entry I have to loop through value list and check whether that process exists in the list. If yes, update the list then update the map. And this is a ConcurrentMap, which means while I am looping through I will lock access to map while update happens. p  pI have tried different solutions to make the update more efficient like using a class codeRangeint min, int maxcode that implements codeComparableltRangegtcode and then have codeNavigableMapltRange, Processgtcode. But this does not cover every scenario overlap, subset of Range to round robin correctly without gaps.p  pAvoiding the loop for update will be nice. Any suggestions for better solutionp

Upond release this documentation will be frozen and provide additional insight into the technique, in addition to what was provided in the event.li liGenerate the basis for subtitles.li liIn addition to above documentation, each such page will also contain discussions between the reviewers concerning the technique. These discussions will be visible on the page, below the video and the documentation, unlike Wikipedia where the discussions appear on different tabs.li liWhen documenting the techniques, the instructors will be able to create and use a collection of terms  names for the techniques. These names will be collected into a central ontology, together with their translation, and will later be used to index the content.li liHebrew support of the content is mandatoryli liThe site will have the ability to contain translated versions of the content where the user can choose the language she will use.

Negative 5954 pSo the company I work for has quite an unorganized approach when it comes to our site.  All of our scripts are procedural with cfincludes thrown within.  Ive been wanting to organize this into an internal API that the other web developers would use to do whatever because making a change has me going thru and locating EVERY other instance that change needs to be updated.p  pI finally have a live example and showed the boss.  It follows what I assumed is the normal method from my googling.  Service layer  Gateway amp DAO  Beans, with some factories to help object creation.  It works well and does exactly what I had wanted it to accomplish.  Hes impressed with it and agrees that we need to spruce up our code and better organize it but doesnt see the advantage of using this method of object oriented API calls to a large list of cfincludes to accomplish the same thing.  In essence, from the way he explained the cfincludes, it would work the same way as a method call.p  pHes asked for the advantages of my approach vs this cfinclude and for the life of me I cant really find any obvious advantages other than grouping similar data all within one object.  Is there anything else or rather perhaps it would be advantageous to go with the cfinclude approachp

I think other parts of the code are selfexplanatory but Ill be happy to elaborate if necessary.  Math.SinMath.PI1.224... instead of 0 as it should. However Math.SinMath.PI40.707... as expected. Furthermore, this is only when pi is generated as Math.PI. If entered in manually as 3.14159, Math.Sin2.65... If entered in as 3.1415926 I get Math.Sin5.35... Can anyone point out whyp  pstrongMath.Log Problemstrongp  pThis part works almost perfectly. The only error occurs when the function is applied successively.

Negative 5954 pI have a manager that mange the worker. And worker doing many work requests. p  pA Manager is a program that monitor all the workers, and communicated with the workers via TCP port. I created many thread to different workers, for example, a data collect workers, a separate thread for that to execute, is responsible for data collection. Only manager can communicate among with workers, and manager can check the workers status. All the work request must though the manager to assign the work request to the workers. p  pThe Worker is a instance that running the while true loop, which open a TCP port that allow the manager to assign the work request to them. And each work request is assigned, a new thread will to assign to handle the work tasks. When the work request is done, the result will send back to the manager. p  pAll the data communicate within the manager and the worker via a TCP Socket. All these are using java to implement. And the data will be a binary data. p  pBut my question is , will it be too many thread or too complex in this architecture For examplep  pUser  assign a work task  Manager Holding many threads, associated with workers assign a work task to the workers  Each work tasks may involve more than one worker, and more complex, which may be sync or async work tasks if this is a sync work task involve two workers, two new threads will be opened, and execute. p  pAs you can see, only one user request may involve 3 threads. If there are many users, the threading number will be increased a lot. Or any suggestions to make it simpler Thanks. p

Negative 5954 pI implemented my own frame decoder to parse the bytes received through a UDP socket using NioDatagramChannelFactory and ConnectionlessBootstrap according to our protocol. Just to follow what is happening in the server while receiving messages, I added trace logs in each callback method of the decoder.p  pIt appears that for almost every message the server receives, we can see that the event channelInterestChanged is received twice in the method channelInterestChanged. The value of the event is first 0 OPNONE then 1 OPREAD. p  pI read the documentation about this, but I am still not sure to understand why I receive such events. I first through it was because the receive buffer or the selector queue was full, but the server receives this event the same number of times it receives the messageReceived event before the decode method is called and all the messagesframes are properly decoded as expected. When messages are missing, I do no see any event at all. In this case it is probably because the receive buffer of the datagram socket is full. But even if I increase this receive buffer, I continue to see these events and to miss messages.p  pSo, I am wondering why for each message received, the server also receives two channelInterestChanged, one with the OPNONE value and one with the OPREAD value. Please, takes note also that in the channel pipeline, after my frame decoder, there is an ExecutionHandler and another businessspecific handler which sends a JMS message to an ActiveMQ instance.p  pAny idea or explanation for mep  pThank you.p
Negative 5954 pI am considering enabling Memcache support for my largescale REST service. However I have some questions regarding best approaches for these keyvalue stores.p  pThe setupp  ul liA database wrapper which has functions for select, update and etc.li liA REST framework which contains all the API functions getUser, createUser and etc.li ul  pIn my head, the ideal approach would be to integrate the Memcache in the database wrapper so, for example, every SQL query would get md5hashed and saved in the cache this is btw what most online resources suggests. However, there is obviously a problem with this approach if a search query has been cached, and one of the users from the search result has been updated after the cached result, this wont reflect in the next request because it is now in the cache.p  pAs I see it I have several ways of handeling thisp  ul liImplement the Memcache in the REST framework for each function getUser, createUser etc and thereby explicit handle the updating of the cache etc. if users gets updated. This could end up in redundant code.li liLet the cached values expire very quickly and live with the fact that some requests shows old cached values.li liDo a more advanced implementation of the Memcache in the database wrapper so that I can identify which partse.g. users to update in e.g. a search request.li ul  pCould you guide me to which of the following, or a complete another approach, to take Thanks in advance. p

Negative 5954 pI am creating an installer using the Adobe AIR captive runtime feature.

Negative 5954 pI am writing a software filter object and trying to implement a light bloom effect.  Im using a simple, two pass convolution approach which works fine except that the effect radius is tiny and I cant seem to control the radius.  Ive played with larger box filters and adjusted the weights of the various pixels, but none of that seems to have any effect.  The effect seems to have a maximum size which is not very big and then all changes to the parameters just serve to make it smaller.p  pId like to be able to create a light bloom with an arbitrary radius.  After a LOT of experimentation and searching online, Im starting to wonder if this just cant be done.  Ive been thinking about alternate approachesplasmas, gradients, and various seeding schemesbut Id like to hound this path into the ground first.  Does anyone out there know how to create an arbitrarily sized light bloom in softwarep  pThe javascript is as follows this operates on an HTML5 canvas I can add comments to the code if neededp  precode the kernel functions are called via Array.map on this.backBuffer.data, a canvas surface color array this.kernelFirstPass  functionval, index, array      ifindexltpitch  indexgtarray.lengthpitch  indexpitchlt4  indexpitchgtpitch5  index43         return     var c  1,         l1  1,         l2  1,         l3  1,         r1  1,         r2  1,         r3  1     var avg               cthis.frontBuffer.data[index]         l1this.frontBuffer.data[index4]         l2this.frontBuffer.data[index8]         l3this.frontBuffer.data[index12]         l1this.frontBuffer.data[index4]         l2this.frontBuffer.data[index8]         l3this.frontBuffer.data[index12]     cl1l2l3l1l2l3     this.frontBuffer.data[index]  avg     array[index]  avg  this.kernelSecondPass  functionval, index, array      ifindexltpitch  indexgtarray.lengthpitch  indexpitchlt4  indexpitchgtpitch4  index43         return     var c  1,         l1  1,         l2  1,         l3  1,         r1  1,         r2  1,         r3  1     var avg               carray[index]         l1array[indexpitch]         l2array[indexpitch2]         l3array[indexpitch3]         l1array[indexpitch]         l2array[indexpitch2]         l3array[indexpitch3]     cl1l2l3l1l2l3     array[index]  avg  codepre  hr  pPerhaps an important point that I missed in my original question was to explain that Im not trying to simulate any real or particular phenomenon and it probably doesnt help that I call it a light bloom.  It could be that, when dealing with real light phenomenon, in order to have a penumbra with arbitrary radius you need a source ie. completely saturated area with arbitrary radius.  If that were in fact the way a real light bloom behaved, then Jims and tskuzzys explanations would seem like reasonable approaches to simulating that.  Regardless, thats not what Im trying to accomplish.  I want to control the radius of the gradient portion of the bloom independently from the sizeintensityetc. of the source.  Id like to be able to set a single, white max value pixel in the center of the screen and have the bloom grow out as far as I want it, to the edges of the screen or beyond if I feel like it.p

Ive tried this using this coffeescript codep  precodeonStartDrag  e, ui  gt     ui.helper.css         left e.clientX         top e.clientY      console.log e  codepre  pBut it doesnt work and my guess is that this is happening because the values I put in are directly overwritten by the draggable plugin because of mouse movement..p  pAny ideasp

Negative 5954 pWe are running Cascading with a Sink Tap being configured to store in Amazon S3 and were facing some FileAlreadyExistsException see [1]. This was only from time to time 1 time on around 100 and was not reproducable.p  pDigging into the Cascading codem, we discovered the Hfs.deleteResource is called among others by the BaseFlow.deleteSinksIfNotUpdate. Btw, we were quite intrigued with the silent NPE with comment hack to get around npe thrown when fs reaches root directory.p  pFrom there, we extended the Hfs tap with our own Tap to add more action in the deleteResource method see [2] with a retry mechanism calling directly the getFileSystemconf.delete.p  pThe retry mechanism seemed to bring improvement, but we are still sometimes facing failures see example in [3] it sounds like HDFS returns isDeletedtrue, but asking directly after if the folder exists, we receive existstrue, which should not happen.

Negative 5954 pIm working on a chat client and I have this problem What I want to do is divide the JTextPane in 3 colums so that in the first one it puts out the name of the user, in the second the message and the date in the third. I tried to do this by creating 3 separate JTextPane, then synchronized their scrollbars and everything seemed to be working perfectly until I saw how it reacted to the insertion of emotiocons. When the message had multiple lines of code, the JTextPanes for name and date printed new lines but the emoticons have different height and the name and date JTextPanes cant keep up with them. For a single line I solved it by inserting a blank image of dimensions 1px, height of the emoticon, but that works only for one of the lines. Lets get back to my question. Im not willing to continue brainstorming on how to fix the problem in the case where I have multiple JTextPanes because Im sure even more problems are going to go out like that.

Negative 5954 pIm not a developer but an internet marketer  so forgive me for what is Im sure a very basic question.  In my career, its useful when looking at website marketing to better understand what tools are used, such as Google Analytics for example.  Most of the time this is quite simple  just view source and youll see in the source code the javascript snippet.p  pI use the ghostery plugin to make this a bit easier, but what I dont understand about http requests is how ghostery reports a technology as being used, such as the ad server DoubleClick for example, but I cant see any code in the source code that references Doubleclick. This happens a lot but its most often with ad server technologies.p  pWhen I look using Chrome Dev Tools, I do in fact see that the call was made by viewing the Source tab.  p  pMy question is this and its really a general question where Im trying to better understand how calls are made back and forth between the browser and all the various servers and servicesp  pHow, in Chrome Tools do I find what code made the call to load the resource, such as DoubleClick. I cant find anything in the source code, which tells me I dont fully understand how interactions are working.   I think from search StackOverflow that is is a xmlhttp call but Im not sure about that, maybe its cookies  I just dont know how this is working.   At the end of the day, I dont like not understanding how this all works, so Im hoping someone can point me in the write direction.p  pThanks. p

Negative 5954 pIm looking to add search capability into an existing entirely static website.  Likely, the new search functionality itself would need to be dynamic, as the search index would need to be updated periodically as people make changes to the static content, and the search results will need to be dynamically produced when a user interacts with it.  Id hope to add this functionality using Python, as thats my preferred language, though am open to ideas.  p  pThe Google Web Search API wont work in this case because the content being indexed is on a private network.  Django haystack wont work for this case, as that requires that the content be stored in Django models.  A tool called mnoGoSearch might be an option, as I think it can spider a website like Google does, but Im not sure how active that project is anymore the project site seems a bit dated.  p  pIm curious about using tools like Solr, ElasticSearch, or Whoosh, though I believe that those tools are only the indexing engine and dont handle the parsing of search content.   Does anyone have any recommendations as to how one may index static html content for retrieving as a set of search results  Thanks for reading and for any feedback you have. p

Data records in database should be persisted for 90 days and even more in some cases not only 2 weeks as I thought earlier. So the total amount of records would be no more than 120 960 00014 days. This is safe estimation. In reality it might be 10 times less 10 reqsecond, 12 960 000 of records.p  pI need to do some analysis on the data, likep  ol liDo something when a new record comes and its value 2 is trueli liDo something when sensor Xs value 2 is true for longer than some declared time 50 minutes, 1 hour or more other timesli liDo something when sensor Xs total true time for value 2 in 24 hours is more than some declared timeli liDo something when sensor Xs value 3 is true for longer than some declared time and no other sensor of type XYZ was active in this period ...li ol  pThe declared time above is greater than or equal to 1 second.p  pThe whole server part is developed in Django and djangorestframework to gather data.p  pThe questions is how to do such data analysis efficiently, assuming that there should be real time or close to real time 1 second monitoring of data and of time periods to trigger desired actions.p  pMy thoughtsp  ol lipRun a process that would query database every second for records that meet criteria and call specific actions it probably would take more than 1 secondpli lipRun some separate processes eventlet one for each analysis type and then query the database every 1 second and fire specific actions.pli lipRun one process per each sensor that continuously reports to its subscribers Im true on value 2 for longer than x seconds etc. Process is reset after new data for that sensor arrives. Some publishsubscribe solution like zeromq might be used herepli lipUse some otherfaster solutionp  ul liMongodb  the problem might be that mongodbs files are not compacted after data is removed 2 weeks. li liHadoop  isnt it too big and too complex for this class of problemsli liPandas and some HDF5 storage  the problem might be whether its capable of doing the analysis Ive described above and probably also with writes into files. But.. might work with mongo too.li ulli ol  pHintsp  pUpdate.p  pCurrently the solution that seems to be simple and effective to me isp  ol liafter data arrives on sensor A run all tests andli listore test results in some tests table or redis in a way that says ul litoday at 115 pm run action sensor open longer thanli litoday at 130 pm run action sensor open longer than in 24h period ...li ulli licontinuously scan the above tests table and when its today 115 pm then run desired action, etc.li liwhen a new signal arrives for sensor A then run all tests again, and also reset data in tests table.li ol  pThis would require me to fire tests each time the request arrives for a specific sensor, but on the other side Ill have to scan only tests table, every 1 second.p  pUpdate 2p  pIve discovered PyTables a hrefhttpwww.pytables.orgmoinPyTables relnofollowhttpwww.pytables.orgmoinPyTablesa, looks its quite well suited for my use case as a data storage.p

The problem is that if I know the value of codetimeInSecondscode is 55, it would still create a new codetimeInSecondscode.p  pI tried my best with my English since I am French, please dont answer if the question was already asked by a beginner iOS developer and just redirect me. I couldnt find an answer though, thanksp  pEDIT Here is the custom getterp  precode floattimeInSeconds  if timeInSeconds      timeInSeconds  0   return timeInSeconds  codepre  pSECOND EDITp  pThe stupid beginner mistake that I made was that addTime and subtractTime are actually implementing a protocol and they set the property which lives in another class which is why I could not access it That other class that needs the protocol was creating a new instance of the class where addTime and subtractTime is written.p  pWhat needs to be done is to set the controller as the delegate for the protocol.

So now I have points 1 and 3 solved kind of.  I still need a way to address bullet point 2, although the work around is easy if I remember to do it.  I am more worried about the people who get the code after me remembering to do it.  p  pI am also looking for a way to not use the eclipse launcher at all.  I know it can be done with adding various profiles and configs.  I just need to find the right configs to do that.  By this, I mean a profile that will run the gwt code in dev mode or superdev mode and also a profile that will run the debugger with the gwt code in dev mode.p  hr  pstrongOn Edit 3strong  I solved bullet point 2.  It was as simple as turning off ProjectBuild Automatically.  Im not sure what that was on in the first place.p  pThat is all 3 bullet points solved.  At this point I probably should create an answer for the question and mark it solved for those that are interested in this and didnt read down this far.

Negative 5954 pIm currently building a web app using Django, and Ive implemented what might be termed a signature field. Essentially, it uses the jQuery UI plugin at a hrefhttpkeithwood.namesignature.html relnofollowhttpkeithwood.namesignature.htmla to implement a signature capture field, which when the form is submitted, is sent via AJAX POST to the server as a base 64 encoded string, then converted to an image on the server.p  pNow, Ive refactored the clientside aspect of it into a reusable widget called a SignatureInput, and Ive also implemented the serverside aspect of it in an individual view. However, Id really like to make it the field generic so that I can use it with the existing generic views, and thats where Im struggling  it may just be a woodforthetrees moment, but I cant find anything in the Django documentation that covers situations like this.p  pThe SignatureField itself extends ImageField, and in the admin interface I want to stick with the existing image upload dialogue, so I dont want to override it at model level. Instead, when its submitted on the front end only, I want it to be pulled from request.POST, processed and added to request.FILES.p  pI defined the following widget for it in widgets.pyp  precodeclass SignatureInputClearableFileInput def renderself, name, value, attrsNone     try         id  self.attrs[id]     except KeyError         id  None     if id          idhtml   ids  id     else         idhtml         Value is set  show existing image and field to change it     if value         html        ltdiv classsignatureContainergt     ltbr gtltimg classexistingSignature altSignature titleSignature srcmediasgtltimggt     ltdiv datarolecollapsiblegt         lth4gtNew signaturelth4gt         ltbr gtltdiv classsignaturesgtltdivgtltbr gtltbr gt         lta datarolebutton classsignatureCleargtClear signatureltagt     ltdivgt            value, idhtml     else         html       ltdiv classsignatureContainergt     ltbr gtltdiv classsignaturesgtltdivgtltbr gtltbr gt     lta datarolebutton classsignatureCleargtClear signatureltagt     ltdivgt           idhtml     return html codepre  pThe SignatureInput field is used for all the frontend forms that require a signature field, and are submitted as base 64 encoded strings using jQuery AJAX.p  pHeres how Ive implemented the serverside code for processing the images in my existing viewsp  precode Create your views here. import cStringIO as StringIO from xhtml2pdf import pisa from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect from django.template.loader import gettemplate from django.template.context import Context from django.shortcuts import render, rendertoresponse from myapp.models import  from myapp.forms import JobForm from django.core.files.uploadedfile import InMemoryUploadedFile from django.conf import settings import base64 import uuid import sys    def decodeImageimage      Remove encoding data     image  image.replacedataimagepngbase64,,         Decode image     image  base64.b64decodeimage       Return it     return image   def addJobrequest      If request is a GET request, just render it     if request.method  GET         return rendertoresponsemyappjobform.html, form JobForm     elif request.method  POST          If request is a POST request, process it          Get the signatures         if request.POST.getusignature             signature  StringIO.StringIOdecodeImagerequest.POST[usignature]               Construct the File objects             signatureOutput  InMemoryUploadedFilesignature,                     fieldnamesignature,                     namesettings.MEDIAROOT  strintuuid.uuid1[10]  .png,                     contenttypeimagepng,                     sizesys.getsizeofsignature,                     charsetNone             request.FILES[usignature]  signatureOutput           Validate the data         jobform  JobFormrequest.POST, request.FILES          if jobform.isvalid              Save the form as a new instance of Job             jobform.save               Show the success page             return HttpResponseRedirectformsjobsaddsuccess         else              Return an error             return renderrequest, myappjobform.html,                  form jobform,              codepre  pHow might I go about carrying out the processing currently done in the addJob view function earlier in the submission process, so that I can use the signature fields with a generic view Basically I need to be able to process the string into an image and move it from request.POST to request.FILES before it hits the view.

Negative 5954 pIn our project we are trying to figure our what the best process to connect to the server will be  especially when taking care of offlineonline scenarios etc.p  pRight now, for us, it seems that all three options to connect to the WL server are similar. Whatever option we use, we can call our Adapter Procedures perfectly and we receive Notification Messages that are set in the console. We are not sure about Direct Update  this is not working properly yet.p  pAre there any important differences between these three ways of connecting to the WL server, or is basically the same connection procedure being executed in all three casesp  pHow about WL.Client.init before connecting  could we call that again in addition to the standard window load EventListener in our code before we connect using a WL.Client.connect manually  or is init supposed to be called only oncep  pTied to that is also offline and reconnecting. As far as I have read in the tutorials, the WL Client framework is managing the connection state. Does that mean that when the WL client is connected to the server through any of these three ways and loses its WLAN3G4G connection or its access to the WL server due to internet connection blocker or so it reconnects automatically regularly tries to reconnect until successful when a connection to the WL server is available againp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI was thinking about Events or Threads that provide more lowlevel information not WORKLIGHTISCONNECTED  basically events that would be triggered when the device losesgets WIFI3G4G connection andor internet connection.

Negative 5954 pHello tried using restkit with coredata. I think that it is great but I think that there is too much magic going on.p  pI have an issue, a user downloads a file and I set the entity downloaded property to YES. I restart the app and the app connects to the server which and reskit nulls my changes because the server doesnt have this parameter. Is there any way to prevent restkit from overriding my local entitiesp  pThanks.p

Negative 5954 pI have a class, which I use as a basis for my unit tests. In this class I initialize the whole environment for my tests, setting up database mappings, enter a number of database records across multiple tables, etc. That class has a method with a BeforeClass annotation which does the initialization. Next thing, I extend that class with specific classes in which I have Test methods.p  pstrongMy question is, since the before class is exactly the same for all these test classes, how can I ensure that they are run only once for all the tests.strong  One simple solution is that I could keep all the tests in one class. However, the number of tests is huge, also they are categorised based on functional heads. So they are located in different classes. However since they need the exact same setup, they inherit the BeforeClass. As a result the whole setup is done at least once per test class, taking much more time in total than I would prefer. p  pI could, though, put them all in various subpackages under one package, hence if there is a way, how I can run set up once for all the tests within that package, it would be great.p

In my action, I return json data which include filename and the uploaded time.p  preturn Jsonnew  error  false, uploadedFilename  filename, uploadedTime  DateTimeOffset.Now p  pQuestion Unfortunately, what the action returns is to print the json data on the page. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhjgj6.png altenter image description herep  pCould anyone help me with  1. How can my view capture the json data and update my dropdown list instead of showing them on the page 2. Should I use ajax jquery ajax or ajax.beginform to handle thisp  pThanks very much Regardsp
Negative 5954 pTheres probably a real simple explanation for this, but Im struggling really hard to find it. Im trying to implement a crop picture feature and Im getting an undesired border on the right and bottom sides of the picture, as seen here a hrefhttpimgur.comXjtk39K relnofollowhttpimgur.comXjtk39Ka. I think Ive narrowed it down to something having to do with the first image translation that happens when I crop the picture. Heres the applicable code the doubling of the cropped image size in codesubmitPhotoUploadcode is due to some unknown halving of the picture height in my code.

Negative 5954 pI have built a simple graphical engine with .obj mesh loader using OpenGL. Now I want to add some textures to my meshes. I intend to use .dds files to store them. I chose SOIL library for loading, due to its simplicity. p  pSo far, Ive only used dynamic dll linking for my externalsSFML, Glew, OpenGL32. SOIL, on the other hand, is a static lib. Ive seen static libs built within project solution, which apparently adds em to .exe and eliminates the need to add dlls. I also read that theres another way to link static lib by adding reference in the Linker Im using VC 2012 as my DevEnv. However, after hours of searching I failed to find a suitable tutorial on how to accomplish this.p  pI renamed src directory in SOIL distribution to include just to be consistent and added it to Additional Include Directories, added the path to the lib directory to the Linker where libSOIL.a file was stored and added libSOIL.a to Additional Dependencies. It gave me lnk2019 err with SOILloadOGLtexture. I renamed libSOIL.a to SOIL.lib adjusting it in  the linker as well  same err persisted. I proceeded to compile provided VS projects and built SOIL.lib in VS9 and VS8 project folders. Linking either was a failure.p  pIn my final moment of desperation, I used extern C, thinking SOIL is a C lib. That was totally stupid   I went on to read that people use g to link their static libs, which I have no idea how to use.p  pCould someone, please, provide a simple stepbystep algorithm on how to link a static lib like SOIL to a VS2012 c project. If you have time, a video on the subject would be absolutely awesome Thanks heaps for any helpp  pP.S. If one of my attempts seems reasonably correct to you, can lnk2019 err pop up due to me compiling in x64 p

Negative 5954 pI wrote a method to permute an array I realize Ruby comes with a permutation function, but I wanted to practice algorithms.

Negative 5954 pMy PHP code allows users to execute arbitrary SQL code in a readonly user. It also needs access to a write capable user. My code executes commands in the write capable user and then using a separate connection queries the db using the readonly user.

As far as I am aware this is the best way to do it but my college is concerned the is somehow MySQL bad practice and want to close the write capable users connection and reopen it later presumably because it doubles the number of concurrent connections to the MySQL.

Negative 5954 pIve got a bit of a problem with printing a html document. Apparently the browsers dont know how wide the paper is, and they make wild and inaccurate guessesp  pThe document is responsive, showing different layouts at different widths, and I hoped that when printing, they would take the styles for about 700 or 800 pixels, but they dont. Not all of them.p  pTried to change the media queries from sizes in codepxcode to physical units codeptcode or codecmcode but that did not help.p  pI also ensured that the browsers were all set to use the same paper size, orientation, and margins, and that they didnt have any scale to fit page flags set.p  pHere is a fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netMrListerLc5kEshow relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netMrListerLc5kEshowabr If you resize the window a bit, you will see that it shows how wide it is. Then when you hit Print Preview, thats when it goes wrong IE says the width of an A4 is 18..19cm, Mozilla says 20..21cm and Chrome says 14..15cm. Opera is the worst of all it doesnt look at the paper at all, it just takes the size of the window on the screen.br And like I said, there is no difference whether you use physical units or pixels or codeemcode.p  pSo am I doing something wrong Am I overlooking something Is there something I can do, short of forcing a fixed paper size like A4 down peoples throatsp  pEdit after some more testing, I found that IE takes the printer margins into account, while Mozilla does not. So if you set all the margins to zero, IE and Mozilla both report 20..21cm for the width. The others are still very uncooperative though.p

Negative 5954 pI am using a OCR algorithm tesseract based which has difficulties with recognizing certain characters. I have partially solved that by creating my own postprocessing hashtable which includes pairs of characters. For example, since the text is just numbers, I have figured out that if there is codeQcode character inside the text, it should be code9code instead.p  pHowever I have a more serious problem with code6code and code8code characters since both of them are recognized as codeBcode. Now since I know what I am looking for when I am translating the image to text and the strings are fairly short 68 digits, I thought to create strings with all possible combinations of code6code and code8code and compare each one of them to the one I am looking for.p  pSo for example, I have the following string recognized by the OCRp  precodeL0B7B0B5 codepre  pSo each codeBcode here can be code6code or code8code.p  pNow I want to generate a list like the belowp  precodeL0878085 L0878065 L0876085 L0876065 . . codepre  pSo its kind of binary table with 3 digits and in this case there are 8 options. But the amount of codeBcode characters in string can be other than 3 it can be any number. p  pI have tried to use Python codeitertoolscode module with something like thatp  precodelistitertools.product[86]  3 codepre  pWhich will provide the following resultp  precode[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6] codepre  pwhich I assume I can then later use to swap codeBcode characters. However, for some reason I cant make codeitertoolscode work in my environment. I assume it has something to do the fact I am using strongJythonstrong and not pure strongPythonstrong. p  pI will be happy to hear any other ideas as how to complete this task.

Negative 5954 pI have a codeListenercode class to listen on a particular HTTP port. I made codeListenercode singleton since there will always be a single listener object listening on a particular port.  For this I made strongdefault codeListenercodestrong contructor codeprivatecode. Made codeListenercode instance inside codeListenercode class codestaticcode and have codestatic Listenercode constructor initialize singleton codeListenercode object. Also have codestatic Listener getListenercode which returns singleton codeListenercode instance.p  pI am receiving a SOAP on this port which my listener callback method is processing.p  pNow I want date time of last notification pushed to my UI.p  pSo what I thought is somehow while initializing codeListenercode I will pass a delegate, a reference to which will be stored inside codeListenercode and then every time I receive a notification, inside listener callback I will call that delegate and pass it current time codenew DateTimecode, which will do necessary task of printing message with time. I also thought of making delegate parameter optional so that if delegate is codenullcode it will not be called at all on notification. However since I made constructor private, I am not able to figure it out how I can pass delegate to it.p  pTo summarize and generalize the whole question How to pass a parameter to be stored as a instance member to singleton classp  pShould I pass delegate to codegetListenercode and inside it check everytime if delegate is null and if not, set it But then if I am accessing this singleton object too many times by calling codeListener.getListenercode, everytime it will unnecessarily check the delegate is codenullcode. In fact thats why I moved initializing codeListenercode to static constructor just to avoid checking if codeListenercode is initialized everytime codegetListenercode is called.p  pWhat should I do to pass parameter to singleton class Or this checks in codegetListenercode inevitable p  pstrongNotestrong I dont know but this question may boil down to how can we pass parameters to static constructor since we need to initialize things first time the class is used and we have to initialize it with delegateother programmatic construct thus we cannot load initialization parameters from some config file inside static constructor.p

Negative 5954 pThis question is academic in nature and typically if I had these issues in the real world Id probably do things differently. However I was curious about whether the speed at which python objects are created could be improved. p  precodeusrbinenv python import time   boring class class boring     def initself, a, b, c         self.a  a         self.b  b         self.c  c  def timefuncf     def ftimerargs, kwargs         start  time.time         result  fargs, kwargs         end  time.time         print f.name, took, end  start, time         return result     return ftimer  timefunc def standardboring     for x in range10000000         b  boring1,2,3     delb  if name  main     standardboring codepre  pOn my machine this takes about 4 seconds. So curious what Python is doing I dug deeper using strace.p  pWhat I see is many tens of thousands of calls to brk e.g.  p  precodebrk0xe35000                            0xe35000 brk0xe34000                            0xe34000 brk0xe33000                            0xe33000 brk0xe32000                            0xe32000 brk0xe31000                            0xe31000 codepre  pMan describes brk as p  blockquote   pbrk and sbrk change  the  location  of  the  program  break,  which          defines  the end of the processs data segment i.e., the program break          is the first location after the end of the uninitialized data segment.          Increasing the program break has the effect of allocating memory to the          process decreasing the break deallocates memory.p blockquote  pEach call to this presumably some number of cycles, as such the very fact there are loads of calls to this makes me think this is what takes the time.p  pSo is there a way to tell python Yo, Im going to be using lots of memory so allocate loads up front. Can I do anything like that I know why you wouldnt want to, like I said this is academic.p  pIve experimented with slots, hypothesizing that if I use less memory then this should improve my speed by the very nature of reducing the reoccurring memory allocation requests. I found the results from this quite lumpy.p  pAny ideas p

Negative 5954 pHappy Friday ThinkTank I need some assistance with a Batch .BAT script. Specifically I need help with some IF statement syntaxp  pI have a script that is renaming files. There are two files, one ending in four digits and the other ending in five digits. The files will be renamed with variables I have already preset earlier within my script.p  pSo here is a scenario We have two files in a directory located atp  pcUsersusernameDesktoptestdirp  h1There are two files within testdirh1  pstrongfile1.12345strongp  pstrongfile2.1234strongp  pA four digit ending is one variable type VAR1, whereas a file ending in five digits is another variable type VAR2.p  pI need an if statement top  pa read all the filess with the chosen directory without using a wildcard if possible. b determine based on the number of digits after the . which variable to use. c once making that determination rename the file with the appropriate variables.p  pThe final renaming convention is as so yyyymmddtype.123412345p  pSo basically it would use the datestamp variable I already created, the type variable I already created to be injected by the if statement, and append with the original ending digits of the file.p  pI know this seems like a lot, but I am more so a bash script guy. I have all the elements in place, I just need the if statement and what feels like a for loop of some kind to tie it all together.p  pAny help would be greatp  pThank youp
Negative 5954 pIn Apples Document Based App Development Guide, it emphasizes that our app should let users choose either to save all their files to iCloud or save all on local device. Is there reason for this Can we actually allow users to pick some files to be saved on iCloud and some to be saved locally, like the TextEdit app on mac OS X Will App Store disapprove iOS apps configured in this way if it is programmatically possiblep  pThanksp

Negative 5954 pI am taking over and revamping an old app at work. The buttons are connected to Expression Engine but it looks to me that the image that servers as the background for these bottoms are coded. I want to change this image so I found the following code and made the following change. The Image that the app had used for a back ground image on the buttons was called navbar.png. I arrived at that conclusion because I went through looking at the images in the file I got off the git repository till I saw one that looked right and then I did a search in the apps code, found it, and replaced it with the new one. The new one has been imported into the apps resources folder where all its media is stored. I see no mention on any .png files in the function that draws the view. and there are no other instances of navbar.png in any other file in the project I even removed it from the resources folder and went through all the other files in the resources folder looking for others that look like the one the app keeps using as the background image.

For example, on one page the user can choose between menu options with mouse clicks by toggling between codedisplaynonecode divs each div is set to codedisplaynonecode...except codediv1code which by default has visibility set to visible when the user goes to this page using the following function codetogglelayercode is called upon each mouse click of other page elementsp  precodefunction togglelayer      var divs  [div1, div2, div3, div4, div5, div6, div7, div8, div9,         div10, div11]     for var i  0 i lt divs.length i  1          document.getElementByIddivs[i].style.display  none          document.getElementByIdlayer.style.display      ltdiv iddiv1 stylevisibilityvisiblegtMore HTML hereltdivgt ltdiv iddiv2 styledisplaynonegtMore HTML hereltdivgt 9 more displaynone divs...success codepre  pHowever, when the div styling is changed to codeclassDNcode codeclassDNcode replaces codestyledisplaynonecode, the div behaves as if the codeDNcode class is not even there at all. I recently encountered a similar problem with some ajaxloaded content on the site.p  precodeltdiv iddiv2 classDNgtMore HTML hereltdivgt Fail...div does not appear upon mouseclick of menu buttons codepre  pI thought the external css file should set the styling for all the DOM elements. As a sidenote, I checked to make sure there were no conflicting css styling elements in my external file... There are no conflicts I can see e.g., if one of my other divs had a codevisibilityvisiblecode style in the external CSS file, etc.. Just out of curiosity, any thoughts on what could be going wrong here by setting the codeclassDNcode instead of inline codestyledisplaynonecodep

It uses JPype to create a Java virtual machine and convert between python and Java. Most of the code is about getting the Stanford Dependencies, but its easy to add API to call any method on the parser.  JPype is included you can set compile it by running rake setup in 3rdPartyjpype.  The Stanford Parser can be downloaded and installed by running rake download rake setup in 3rdPartystanfordparser. Otherwise set the environment variable STANFORDPARSERHOME to the location of the installed directory.  It loads the grammar file from the unzipped version, because the load is a few seconds faster.

Negative 5954 pI have a rather strange scenario. I am using autofac on a project that has both MVC4 pages and Web API endpoint. Autofac is managing the scope of my model object which in turn manages the scope of the database context and I have it configured for codeInstancePerHttpRequestcode and codeInstancePerApiRequestcode so that only one database context is created per request. This is so that any database objects that I use are all attached to the same request the context is an EF6 context.p  pHere is my strange scenario The application supports a proxying capability where one user can become another for the duration of the page request. In order to make sure that even codeAuthorizeAttributecodes pay attention to this, I am catching the request at the codePostAuthenticateRequestcode event and performing the codeIPrincipalcode switch and also setting up the user which my database context uses. The problem comes with a permission check I need to ask my database if a user is allowed to proxy as the user they would like to proxy as. The code is more or less as followsp  precodeprotected void ApplicationPostAuthenticateRequest      if User.Identity.IsAuthenticated             return nothing to do here if we are not authenticated      var cookie  Request.Cookies.GetControllers.ProxyController.ProxyCookie      The uhoh occurs at this line...read the rest of the question     var model  DependencyResolver.Current.GetServiceltModel.MyModelgt      we load the user initially     this sets up the user for the rest of the request since our model object should be shared for everything     var user  model.Users.Whereu gt u.username  User.Identity.Name.FirstOrDefault     model.User.Current  model.User.Actual  user      if cookie  null              we ask the database if this user can proxy as the cookied username         var proxyAs  model.Users.Whereu gt u.username  cookie.Value.FirstOrDefault         if user  null ampamp proxyAs  null                      if user.CanProxyAsproxyAs                              this user is allowed to proxy as the specified user                 string[] roles                 if proxyAs  null                                      get their roles to replace ours                     roles  proxyAs.groups.SelectManyg gt g.roles.Selectr gt r.name.ToArray                                  else                                      no roles according to the database                     roles  new string[0]                                   set the model user stuff                 model.User.Actual  user                 model.User.Current  proxyAs                  save the original user IPrincipal                 HttpContext.Current.Items[Controllers.ProxyController.ProxyUser]  User                  we need to set the thread current principal as well to keep it in sync                  MVC3 stuff controllers appears to use HttpContext.Current.User                  MVC4 stuff web api appears to use Thread.CurrentPrincipal                 Thread.CurrentPrincipal  HttpContext.Current.User  new GenericPrincipalnew GenericIdentitycookie.Value, roles                             codepre  pThe problem is at the part where I use the codeDependencyResolvercode to resolve the model object. p  pThis is not a problem at all for MVC requests...they use the codeDependencyResolvercode later to create the controllers. The codeAutofacDependencyResolvercode is a codeAutofacDependencyResolvercode as set up per the autofac MVC documentation.p  pFor Web API requests, however this is a problem. Since I used the codeAutofacDependencyResolvercode to resolve the model object in this method, an instance of the model has been instantiated for the codeInstancePerHttpRequestcode lifetime. However, the WebAPI is going to use codeGlobalConfiguration.Configuration.DependencyResolvercode which is set up as an codeAutofacWebApiDependencyResolvercode per the autofac Web API documentation. What ends up happening is that the model object used by a WebAPI call has not had its codemodel.Usercode property set up since the MVC codeDependencyResolvercode gave us back a different model.p  pI could always set both objects, but then we have context issues. I never know which resolver to use Should I use the MVC codeDependencyResolvercode or the Web API dependency resolverp  pFurther complicating matters is the fact that the web api dependency resolver can only operate in the context of an codeHttpRequestMessagecode i.e. inside an Action method. This object is not available during codePostAuthenticateRequestcode.p  pstrongMy questionsstrongp  pCan I somehow tell autofac that it needs to use the same objects when resolving for both codeInstancePerApiRequestcode and codeInstancePerHttpRequestcodep  pIf that is not possible, is there some way I canp  ul liFigure out if the request is an API request or MVC request andli liGet the codeHttpRequestMessagecode during codePostAuthenticateRequestcode if it is an API request and use that for dependency resolutionli ul  pI may also need to seriously rethink the way I am doing this since this seems at first glance to not be possible per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13549518autofacreturnsdifferentinstanceinaspnetmvcwebapithisa answer.p  pEDIT I believe I may be able to use a codeSystem.Net.Http.DelegatingHandlercode to intercept the WebAPI request which eliminates the need to obtain the codeHttpRequestMessagecode during codePostAuthenticateRequestcode. However, that still leaves the question of determining if the request is a web api request or not.p

Normally there are no issues but there are a few reports where each customer gets their own copy and errors are being reported by Outlook when the number of customers is over 100.p  pWe did track down the problem to Outlook not being able to create more than 100 temporary copies of the same attachment name, due to the autonumbering it uses.

Negative 5954 pI have a character that runs around the screen, and an image of a tree.  I have collidewidget working so that when the character runs into the tree, it returns True.  The problem is that I am trying to stop the character from running over the tree, the tree should be blocking the characters movement.  What I have tried to do was stop the characters movement to the left, when running into the tree from the left.  When I do this it works and I can then use the up, down or, right key to run away from the tree.  However, if I use this code for all directions, it prevents me from being able to walk away from the tree in any direction once the collidewidgettree is True.  I understand the problem, but I am not sure the solution.  Is there a better way to do this  Here is part of the code.

Negative 5954 pI need a servlet filter that will capture all input, then mangle that input, inserting a special token in every form.  Imagine that the filter is tied to all requests E.g. codeurlpatterncode.  I have the code for capture of content, but it doesnt seem like the codeRequestWrappercode is robust enough to capture all input.  Some input returns zero bytes and then I cant stream that content back to the user.  For example, we are still using Struts 1.3.10 and any Struts code does not capture properly, we get zero byte content.  I believe it is because of how Struts handles forwards.  If there is a forward involved in the request, I wonder if the capture code below will work.  Here is all the code, do you have an approach that will capture any type of content that is meant for streaming to the user.p  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltfiltergt    ltfilternamegtFilterltfilternamegt    ltfilterclassgtmybrokenCaptureHtml.TokenFilterltfilterclassgt ltfiltergt  ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtFilterltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt  ltfiltermappinggt codepre  hr  precodepackage mybrokenCaptureHtml  import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream import java.io.IOException import java.io.PrintWriter  import javax.servlet.Filter import javax.servlet.FilterChain import javax.servlet.FilterConfig import javax.servlet.ServletException import javax.servlet.ServletOutputStream import javax.servlet.ServletRequest import javax.servlet.ServletResponse import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponseWrapper  public class TokenFilter implements Filter          Override     public void destroy            public void doFilterServletRequest servletRequest, ServletResponse servletResponse, FilterChain chain throws IOException, ServletException          HttpServletRequest request  HttpServletRequest servletRequest                        HttpServletResponse response  HttpServletResponse servletResponse         try                                                                                                     final MyResponseWrapper responseWrapper  new MyResponseWrapperHttpServletResponse response             chain.doFilterrequest, responseWrapper                                      HERE DEPENDING ON THE SERVLET OR APPLICATION CODE STRUTS, WICKET, the response returns an empty string               Especiall struts, is there something in their forwards that would cause an error             final byte [] bytes  responseWrapper.toByteArray                       For some applications that hit this filter                      ZERO BYTE DATA is returned, this is bad, but SOME                      CODE, the data is captured.             final String origHtml  new Stringbytes              final String newHtml  origHtml.replaceAlliltsformsgt, ltinput typehidden namezval valuefromSiteZ123gtltformgt                       response.getOutputStream.writenewHtml.getBytes           catchfinal Exception e                          e.printStackTrace                  return           Override     public void initFilterConfig filterConfig throws ServletException                    static class MyResponseWrapper extends HttpServletResponseWrapper              private final MyPrintWriter pw  new MyPrintWriter                        public byte [] toByteArray                          return pw.toByteArray                          public MyResponseWrapperHttpServletResponse response              superresponse                          Override         public PrintWriter getWriter              return pw.getWriter                  Override         public ServletOutputStream getOutputStream              return pw.getStream                         private static class MyPrintWriter              private ByteArrayOutputStream baos  new ByteArrayOutputStream             private PrintWriter pw  new PrintWriterbaos             private ServletOutputStream sos  new MyServletStreambaos             public PrintWriter getWriter                  return pw                          public ServletOutputStream getStream                  return sos                          byte[] toByteArray                  return baos.toByteArray                                   private static class MyServletStream extends ServletOutputStream              ByteArrayOutputStream baos             MyServletStreamfinal ByteArrayOutputStream baos                  this.baos  baos                          Override             public void writefinal int param throws IOException                  baos.writeparam                              codepre  pThis is what an example Struts app may look like, for some applications not Struts, we may capture the content.

Negative 5954 pOkay, so Ive gotten the infinite scroll plugin for Wordpress to work almost perfectly. The exception is that when the plugin tries to load a page that doesnt have any more posts e.g. mysitepage4 it appends the posts from the initial page instead of returning a 404 page and thus kill infinite scroll. This results in the plugin never stopping loading posts.p  pI found the codepaged404fixcode in the php file and changed it like thisp  precodefunction paged404fix     global wpquery      I Have no idea why this worked, but it did, but for some reason it removed     the strict doctype from the html and made the plugin act weird.   echo countwpquerygtposts    if  is404  ispaged  0  count wpquerygtposts         return       wpquerygtset404   statusheader 404    nocacheheaders  codepre  pThe page that contains my posts is the Posts page pointing to a custom page.p  pI dont know if this is of any use but if I go to mysitepage4 in the address bar I get redirected to mysite but if i go to mysitepagerandomstring I get a 404.p  pIm suspecting that codepaged404fixcode is fetching posts from the start page because mysitepage4 redirects to the start page. p  pAnyone had a similar problem with this pluginp

Negative 5954 pI am trying to build a C widget to run alongside a C service architecture.  I am leveraging an existing C interface service that publishessubscribes data and I am hooking it up to the C visualizations callbacks.  p  pSo Ive got a solution with a C project and the C data interface project.  The C interface project is compiling with clr, MDd, and EHa, but it depends on a lot of libs that are compiled with EHsc and MTd.  The linker doesnt like it when those flags dont match.  p  pIf I change the data interface to use MTd and EHsc like its dependencies, it tells me that is inconsistent with clr.  I assume I have to get the C data interface to compile with clr so it can talk to the C visualization, right  But I dont own the C projects dependency libraries, so I cant change how they are compiled.  p  pSo my question is, can you get a C application to talk to a C DLL when that DLL has dependencies that were compiled with the MTd and EHsc options  p

Negative 5954 pI recently got setup with Eclipse for Android development, and I was wondering if there was any sort of incremental autocompletion that could be enabled. Currently, if I were to start typing the letter a in an xml layout file, I can see a list of suggestions including everything that uses the codeandroidcode namespace. If I wanted to narrow it down to something like codeandroidlayoutmarginEndcode, I would have to type out codeandroidlayoutmcode just to have the list shorten enough to see the codeandroidlayoutmarginEndcode option. p  pIs there any way I can configure Eclipse to behave like a Unix terminal, so that autocompletion when there is more than one possible suggestion will only complete up to the point of divergence For example, the letter a would autocomplete to codeandroidcode. codeandroidlayocode would autocomplete to codeandroidlayoutcode. codeandroidlayoutmcode would autocomplete to codeandroidlayoutmargincode. It would save a heck of a lot of typing p

With certain bones it moves correctly for the middle section of the animation. But honestly nothing good. Can someone explain whats going on here How do I get the position of the bone in the palm Im really in the dark here. I only learnt what a matrix was 2 months ago, and animation with bones only this week.p

Negative 5954 pIve got a program that will dynamically access different methods and each method will have different amounts of parameters. I need to find a way to permute through thousands of different arrangements of these parameters, and Im not sure how to loop through these permutations dynamically.p  pFor instance, for a function that has two parameters, I can iterate through the permutations like thisp  precodepublic static void mainString[] args      ListltObject[]gt params  new ArrayList     params.addnew Integer[]1,2,3     params.addnew Boolean[]false,true      runCalculationfunction1,params   public void runCalculationString functionName, ListltObjectgt parameters      forObject i  parameters.get0         forObject j  parameters.get1             Do reflection function call with i,j as parameters                codepre  pBut if I were to have the next function I want to run use 3 parameters, this will no longer iterate through all the permutations. How can I use a dynamic amount of for loops to correctly process a list of arrays containing parameter values I think recursion is the only way to implement something like this but Im still struggling to think up a correct solution to this that will correctly allow for a dynamic amount of parameters for each function, and then different types for these parameters.p

At that time in the video, he begins incorporating his Shader class I copied everything exactly how he did it, by the way. Anyways, when I call the compileShader method, which looks like this,p  precodepublic void compileShader      glLinkProgramprogram      ifglGetProgramiprogram, GLLINKSTATUS  GLFALSE              System.err.printlnglGetShaderInfoLogprogram, 1024         System.exit1           glValidateProgramprogram      ifglGetProgramiprogram, GLVALIDATESTATUS  GLFALSE              System.err.printlnglGetShaderInfoLogprogram, 1024         System.exit1        codepre  pMy program crashes because the glGetProgramiprogram, GLLINKSTATUS ALWAYS equals GLFALSE GLFALSE  0. Same for the glGetProgramiprogram, GLVALIDATESTATUS, it returns GLFALSE. By the way, I used glGetProgrami instead of glGetProgram because the latter is a deprecated method. Also, System.err.printlnglGetShaderInfoLogprogram, 1024 doesnt print ANYTHING.p  pAfter a thorough online search of the main problem, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma86126373584262thisa was the only thread I could find that resembled my problem, it actually seems like the exact same problem. His solution is to change the 3D settings of his intel graphics card, but when I try to follow his steps, I dont have the same options he has for configuring 3D settings.

Negative 5954 pI am working on a project where I am using Solr for data retrieval. To my knowledge, Solr uses Lucene internally. And Lucene creates an Inverted Index. And this index is stored in several files in file system as mentioned in the documentation  a hrefhttplucene.apache.orgcore303fileformats.htmlInverted20Indexing relnofollowhttplucene.apache.orgcore303fileformats.htmlInverted20Indexingap  pI am curious to know how this works while searching. Does the inverted index will be loaded and kept in memory so that it doesnt need to go to file system. If not, is there a way I can keep this in memory so that my search can be much faster.p

Cropping the areas outside isnt an issue.p  pThe boundary in the image is afflicted both by noise bottomleft for example and some areas of discontinuity. That means I cant simply select the shape based on one known pixel.p  pThe problem left to me is pretty simple  I only really need to fill the gaps in the boundary and smooth it out, so that I am left with something smooth and continuous that I can extract afterwards.

Negative 5954 pI have a CardLayout composed of numerous different JPanels which I show at will. This GUI is linked to a backend, and the purpose of the GUI is to allow the user to manipulate the data which is stored in the backend.p  pThe problem is, when the user changes some data in the backend, my JLabels are not reflecting the change in that data. I understand that this is because the JLabels are initialized once, and when I update the variables that they are initialized to, I must call setText again in order for them to experience the change.p  pExample Here is how my JLabel is initializedp  precodeCurrentBAName  new javax.swing.JLabel CurrentBAName.setTextGUI.currentBankAccount.getAccountName codepre  pThe problem is, when I change the value of codeGUI.currentBankAccount.getAccountNamecode, the text on my JLabel does not update. I have JLabels like this all over the place, and it would be a pain to have to go through and manually call setText on all of them each time a user makes any kind of change. Is there any way that I can have the JLabel automatically update itself when the value of that variable changesp  pPerhaps I could implement some sort of Observer pattern How would I do this with JLabelsbr Or maybe I could use a focusGained Event so that every time I switch to a panel, the focusGained event fires so that I can update things. I am not sure how to do this though, and I am not sure how focus works with CardLayout.  Maybe just a method that gets called every time I show a panel with codelayout.show..code.

Negative 5954 pTo effectively find n nearest neighbors of a point in ddimensional space, I selected the dimension with greatest scatter i.e. in this coordinate differences between points are largest. The whole range from minimal to maximal value in this dimension was split into k bins. Each bin contains points which coordinates in this dimensions are within the range of that bin. It was ensured that there are at least 2n points in each bin. The algorithm for finding n nearest neighbors of point x is followingp  ol liIdentify bin kx,in which point x liesits projection to be precise.li liCompute distances between x and all the points in bin kx.li liSort computed distances in ascending order.li liSelect first n distances. Points to which these distances were measured are returned as n nearest neighbors of x.li ol  pThis algorithm is not working for all cases. When algorithm can fail to compute nearest neighbors Can anyone propose modification of the algorithm to ensure proper operation for all casesp

In this code the method where you can work with the uncompressed data is codepublic int writebyte[] datacode from codeISequentialOutStream code where codebyte[] datacode is the uncompressed data.

You can navigate to the child report, once you click a field which has a drill through action from the summary report. p  pI dont have a problem passing the parameter values from the parent to the child report.

Negative 5954 pI currently have a private key meant to be used for signing documents which is currently stored in a keystore. Despite the server being dedicated for this task ie no one has access to it other than the signing service running over https I am unwilling to keep the password for the keystore in plain text. I recognize that this could be a potential risk if anyone ever had access to the server.p  pWhat I am thinking could be appropriate would be keeping the password for the Keystore encrypted in the server with the users password. So, whenever the user wanted to make use of the private key it would be necessary to provide his password. Password changes would not be a problem since the encrypted password could be decrypted with the old one and encrypted with the new one.p  pFor an attacker to gain access to the PK it would be necessary to guess someones password and have access to the server to decrypt the password to access the KeyStore. Strong password policies could be enforced to avoid weak passwords and not all users would be given the possibility to sign documents.p  pI was reading the a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenbook.openssl.php relnofollowOpenSSL PHP pagea when I found this comment with a score of code8codep  blockquote   pAfter generating a key pair with OpenSSL, the public key can be stored   in plain text format. I then encrypted the private key itself using   regular mcrypt with the humanmemorizable key of my choice and   converted it to ACSII using base64encode. Then to get the private key   back, I just decrypted it with mcrypt. This way I could store the   encrypted private key on the server without worrying about having   things stored unencrypted.p      pOf course, this will only be as good as your humanmemorizable key is   and can potentially reduce the security of your script if you choose   something simple or dont use salts.p blockquote  pSo, is this such a bad idea or could this be used in productionp

Negative 5954 pon parse I have strongUsersstrong and strongEventsstrong. Events has a strongdatestrong attribute that tells when will the event begin. p  pUsers can attend to a scheduled event. What I want to do is that if user has some event next day the app should notify him at 7pm on a day before the event happens. If user dont have any event scheduled for next day then he shouldnt be notifyied. p  pWhat is the most efficient way to do this with parse What I think itll work is to create a function on parse Cloud that runs once a day and fetch all the events that are scheduled for the next day and send them scheduled push. The only problem I see is that querying Events is probably limit to 1000 in case there will be more than 1000 events scheduled for one day and if scheduled push from Cloud code takes into account time localization. Whatll be your approach to do that. p  pAlso I need to tell, that all the events have an array of users that will attend the Event so sending a push to them isnt hard to do it and this code is already done and it works. p

Negative 5954 pIm using this code to change the cursor when I click an item in my inventory. The image codestyle.cursorurlmyurlvariablehere,autocodep  pWhich works fine. The issue is, depending on how large the image is, it repositions your cursor dynamically.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHV9FL.png altp  pSee the position of V Thats where your cursor goes when clicking the image and changing the cursor dynamically to an image. Is it possible with javascript to add a padding, or move the cursors position closer to the image upon clickation The V should be closer to the image, or item being clicked. It seems like the browser renders the cursor based on the image dimensions Then ads some type of padding  margin when changing the cursor. Is it possible to disable thatp

Negative 5954 pAs I understand things, ZooKeeper will persist tuples emitted by bolts so if a bolt crashes or a computer with the bolt crashes, or the entire cluster crashes, the tuple emitted by the bolt will not be lost.

If a spout emits a tuple i.e., the codeemitcode function within a spout is executed, and the computer the spout is running on crashes shortly thereafter, will that tuple be resurrected by ZooKeeper Or do we need Kafka in order to guarantee thisp  pP.S. I understand that the tuple emitted by the spout must be assigned a unique ID in the call to codeemitcode.p  pP.P.S.

Negative 5954 pThere seems to be many different ways to navigate between views in a XAML based application e.g. going from your login screen in your app to your main view after login.p  pThe official Microsoft guides all prefer doing this in the code behind using Frame.Navigate see a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappsdn263172.aspx relnofollow1a.p  pThis is not what you want to do if your application is built using MVVM. The well known pattern for MVVM is to use XAML datatemplates and set the content of your main main control to the right view model. See for example a hrefhttpsrachel53461.wordpress.com20111218navigationwithmvvm2 relnofollow2a or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19654295wpfmvvmnavigateviews3a.p  pThis is perfect and is working fine, except for the fact that the views are recreated during navigation. So, for example, if I have a contact list view with the corresponding view model and I navigate to a new view when a contact is selected for example to start communicating with the given contact via IM, when I want to come back to the contact list view this view will be recreated because the framework notices that a new view model is set as the content and then based on the data templates it instantiates the corresponding view. p  pThis means that...p  ol lipUnless absolutely everything is stored in the view model e.g. the previous scroll position of the contact list, the selected contact, etc this new view wont show the exact same state the user left it the previous time.pli lipEven if the view model contains the full presentation state which I dont think it should, the view will be rerendered which causes at a minimum a small flicker which is simply not acceptable from the user experience point of view. pli ol  pSo my question is, whats the official best practice for doing a simple task such as navigating from view A to view B in a XAML app using the ModelViewViewModel pattern p  pI understand that there are frameworks out there that might help, but I would like to understand the low level details how should I do this myself or if there is anything which I am missing as it seems strange that doing such a simple thing is so complicated to achieve.p  pI dont know if it matters, but I am specifically working with C XAML WinRT apps for Windows 8.1Windows mobile 8.1 hopefully 10 very soon. p

Negative 5954 pThis is the situationbr We have a series of users who share some documents.

Each document would have a Users array and then a filter in the design document would take care of the replication to the clients. Unfortunately document deletions and document changes that wont pass the filter e.g. a user is removed from the array are not present in the changes feed so cannot be replicated accordingly on the clientsbr 2 database per user. This is not possible, because users need to see each others work on the documents they share thembr 3 database per group of users. Pretty much the same problem as the first solution, but worse. In factbr  groups of user can change and no longer be present how do reflect that clientsidebr  a document can shift to a new group it will have to be redownloaded from scratch. This greatly increases the download sizebr  the same document can be in more than one group see example abovebr  each client would have to know in which group she is everytime she logs in and replicate multiple databases.

Negative 5954 pAfter reading Stephen Clearys a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedn802603.aspx relnofollowarticlea on async and asp.net,  it is quite clear that using Async in web application is a big win on scalability primarily due to nonblocking threads that are free to serve up more requests. p  pAlthough I am a little confused as to how does the Task object returned by the async operation remain in scope in an Aysnc WebServer implementation lets say iis or selfhosted WebApi and not get collected.p  pfor example,p  pIf we have the following method in a low level Webserver implementation,p  precode some method that handles HttpListeners BeginContextAsync callback,  public void SomeHttpListenerCallbackHttpListenerContext context        Immediately set up the next begin context                   then handle the request      forgive me if this is incorrect but this is my understanding of how an async request would be handled      please feel free to point out the flaws     var task   messageHanlder1.SendAsynccontext.Request, null      task.ContinueWitht gt SendResponset    public class MessageHandler1  DelegatingHandler      protected async override TaskltHttpResponseMessagegt SendAsync         HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken              Debug.WriteLineProcess request          Call the inner handler.         var response  await base.SendAsyncrequest, cancellationToken         Debug.WriteLineProcess response         return response       codepre  pcodeSendResponsecode being some method that sends the response to clients socket.p  pAs you might have noticed, task object drops out of scope in codeSomeHttpListenerCallbackcode, since no other thread theoretically has any reference to the task object, wouldnt it be marked for collection in next GC cyclep  pI have read Jeffrey Ritchers explanation Clr via C of how compiler converts an aysnc method into a method with a state machine, however I fail to understand what happens to the task object if no thread waits on it. p  pAnd if a thread waits on it, wouldnt we have 1 blocked thread per request Any help to point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 5954 pA long time ago I remember opening an executable file .exe in a text editor, and saving it back to the hard drive. The executable, needless to say, didnt open.p  pMy understanding is that a file is a series of bytes. In the case of a text file, these bytes encode letters. In the case of an executable file, these bytes encode instructions.p  pBoth text files and executable files are simply a series of bytes, and my understanding is that those bytes are only given meaning by how you interpret them. The character a could be a letter in the word apple, or one byte in a legitimate program coding for some low level operation. Likewise, all the instructions of the program can be interpreted as gibberish characters in the context of being a text document.p  pSo my question then is why, since I havent changed anything in the file before saving it, it would no longer work as a program. Shouldnt the series of bytes be the exact samep  pWhat specifically changes about this file when I use a text editor which causes it to no longer execute even though the filename and contents are the samep

Negative 5954 pI am not as familiar with web services and Im having a hard time finding information about a question regarding the way clients interact with a RESTful web service.p  pIve implemented a REST web interface to interact with clients using Java and the Jersey JAXRS library, however I need to limit the number of connected clients to 6. If I have 6 clients connected and a 7th tries to connect, I need to know if one of the other 6 has disconnected at some point so I can give the new client a connection. Is there a simple way to tell on the server side if a client is still connected Do clients maintain connection in a REST web service after they complete a request to the server Normally the clients Im dealing with make HTTP POST and GET requests to the server at least one a second. p  pThe only thing I can think of would be to ping each connected client and wait for a response in the event of another client trying to connect. If one ping times out then I could replace that client with the new one. But Im not really sure how that would impact server performance. If anyone has any input on a way too accomplish this, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanksp

Negative 5954 pI have a couple of small but often used tables in my database.  Entries from these tables are often added as navigation properties to new entries in other tables.  It seemed that caching their keys System.Data.Entity.Core.EntityKey was a good idea to prevent having to read them from the DB every time to assign them to the navigation properties.p  pOver the last couple of days way too long, I have gotten closer to a solution.  I have learned that the newly created entity must be in the DbContext prior to setting its entity key.  I accomplish that by dbContext.emDbSetNameem.Addemnewly created entityem.p  pI then get the EntityRefernce for the relation in question and set the EntityKey accordingly.p  pThe problem is that this operation only works if the entity represented by the EntityKey is currently in the DbContext.  If the entity is not read into the DbContext, setting of EntityKey succeeds IE. no exception but does not result in the navigation property being updated from null and the eventual result is a data validation error when the save is done.p  pThis scenerio seems to be totally unreasonable because it totally undoes the effect of the caching of the keys because I still have to ensure that the entity is loaded.  While I can and have easily done so with a Find operation based on the key from the EntityKey, I cannot help but believe that I have missed something in this process.p  pI am using .Net 4.6 with EF 6.1.3p

The second Activity then sends a Broadcast to the first Activity to make sure it finishes it never finished if I just called finish before starting my 2nd Activity.p  pThe reason I have to pass the Intent to the 2nd Activity is that the user needs to log in first and I initially had a multiActivity architecture with a separate login Activity.p  pEdit  As Sebastian pointed out the Broadcasts are unnecessary but that was not the problem. It turns out that the second Activity was started directly without passing through the first one again. To work around this I am now setting a boolean as a SharedPreference in my first Activity and reset it after the image has been handled. Only if this flag is true Ill do the image handling.p

Negative 5954 pSo for the past few days Ive been messing around with javascript and html. On html 5 video tags. I wanna create a solid videoplayer without jquery. I have had a look at different tutorials regards custom controls like volume, play and pause and fullscreen. I wanna dive in a little more but not having much look on finding a good source, regarding some more advance controls. Things like hovering on the timeline and getting an image of what is shown at the time. Pretty much like the way youtube and other video players work. Adding more tuff stuff like time information, scrub bar, key moments, microscrubbing and subtitles.p  pCan anyone point me in a direction where I could find anything like what ive listedp  pThank you Dp

Negative 5954 pCan anyone tell me if there is a way to change the default file size of photos when they are taken on an Ipad v 8.4, without having to get 3rd party software. I have a website that people upload images too, using an Ipad. The current default file size of the photos taken on the Ipad are just over 1mb per photo. The users of the service are only allocated a small amount of file space on the server, and I am concerned with photos this large they will go over their allocation. Any help would be appreciatedp
