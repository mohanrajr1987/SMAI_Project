Positive 2548 pI am trying to receive a UDP packet using Boost asio. My code is based off of a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1560dochtmlboostasioexamplecpp03timeoutsblockingudpclient.cpp relnofollowthis blocking UDP client example from the asio documentationa.p  pI am trying to receive a BOOTPlike UDP packet from a C6655 TI DSP, which are being transmitted in 3 second intervals. I have Wireshark watching the same interface my program is listening on, and it can see the packets arriving see below for the exact packet data, exported from Wireshark.

Positive 2548 pI am developing a logic core to perform data transfer between a FPGA and a PC over ethernet, using a LAN8710 PHY on my FPGA board.p  pIve achieved to transfer some UDP data packets from the FPGA to the PC. Its a simple core that complies with the PHY transfer requirements. It builds the UDP package and transfer it to the PC.p  pTo check the reception on the PC, I am using Wireshark and as said above, I receive the packets correctly. Ive checked the reception with a simple UDP receiver written by myself.p  pBut, Ive noticed that I only receive these packets when Wireshark is running on the PC. I mean, if Wireshark is ON, my application receives the packets too, and the counter of received packets of the following picture increases. This picture is not mine, just one from the internetp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comwsChT.gif relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comwsChT.gifap  pIf I close Wireshark, the PC stops receiving packets and the counter of received packets stops. My application stops receiving too.p  ol lipAlthough novice on networking topics, I suspect that this issue is related to PCside. Seems like Wireshark is openingclosing the ethernet communication channel, or something like that. Does anyone knows about this issuepli lipTo build a functional core to transfer data between a PC and the FPGA, Ive developed a core to transfer and receive UDP packets. Next step will be ARP implementation to let the PC identify my FPGA board, as I understand. What protocols are necessary to perform fullduplex data transfer between this 2 devicespli ol  pThank you very much in advance,p  pmigue.p

Positive 2548 pI read a little about PAWS Protection Against Wrapping Sequence. Its very interesting. I didnt know such complicated things are implemented to guarantee the reliability of TCP. Without PAWS, in the case of high data rate, a delayed old packet can be received and regarded as the new packet by mistake.p  pI didnt think much about this before. But now I started to wonder how long a packet can stay in network Especially UDP packet if the type of packet matters. A packet can be delayed, temporarily stay in the network before its delivered. But it can only stay for a short period of time, rightp  pIn other words, how much time does it take to wait for a UDP packet before concluding that it wont comep  pIf there is an answer, then how is it determined How to estimate it for writing programs related to timeout of packet.p  hr  pA simplified example A server received 2 UDP packets. Each contains an integer to indicate the order. It got No.1 and No.3. It knows No.2 is either delayed or lost. After a period of time, No.2 still doesnt come then it concludes the packet is lost. The packet doesnt exist anymore. So it wont cause any trouble for new packets in the future, similar to the problem PAWS aims to solve. But how long should the the server wait before concluding No.2 doesnt exist anymorep
Positive 2548 pLets say i have this context im Listening on 85.222.45.11156.p  pA client, with source Src IP92.35.21.6 Src Port6320 send a packet to Dst IP 85.222.45.1 Dst Port1156p  pThe server answers to client address Dst IP92.35.21.6 Dst Port6320 but from another address, lets say Src IP 101.344.53.12 Src Port 1156p  pIs that possiblep  pI think that may be possible, only if the application is able to understand what packet belongs to a determined session based on content of UDP packet. So in this case, the only way to connect sessions is based on Port recognition and UDP packet.p  pWhat do you thinkp  pEDIT This happens because of a load balancing configuration. So i was just wondering.p

Positive 2548 pWhat disadvantages or advantages are there to setting different values for a send and receive buffer on opposite sides of a connection It seems to make the most sense and the norm to keep these values the same. But if one side say the sender side has the resources to double their buffer size, what implications could this havep  pI guess a related question is, what disadvantages are there to setting a largerthanrequired buffer size From what Ive read, it sounds like you could potentially overflow the receive buffer if your send buffer is larger. Additionally, it seems like there may not be a need to increase buffer sizes as long as your applications are keeping up with the load and can handle maxsize messages. It doesnt necessarily mean you could handle more data throughput because you are still limited by the opposite endpoint. Is this correctp  pThe specific kernel settings in question are as followsp  precodenet.core.wmemmax net.core.rmemmax codepre

Positive 2548 pIm doing some UDP bandwidth tests using iperf a hrefhttpsiperf.fr relnofollowhttpsiperf.fra over IPv6. I have very bad results when using a Linux UDP client with the following command linep  precodeiperf u V c fe805910d4fffe315b10usb0 b 100m codepre  pInvestigating the issue with Wireshark I have seen there is some fragmentation while the client is sending data. To be more precise, I see UDP client outgoing packets with size 1510 bytes and 92 bytes, alternating. For example, the UDP packets that I see have the following pattern in size 1510, 92, 1510, 92, 1510, 92,...,1510, 92,...p  pReading iperf2 documentation I read the following for option l p  pThe length of buffers to read or write. iPerf works by writing an array of len bytes a number of times. Default is 8 KB for TCP, 1470 bytes for UDP. Note for UDP, this is the datagram size and needs to be lowered when using IPv6 addressing to 1450 or less to avoid fragmentation. See also the n and t options.p  pI have tried to do the same bandwidth test by replacing the Linux iperf UDP client command line with the followingp  precodeiperf u V c fe805910d4fffe315b10usb0 b 100m l1450 codepre  pand I see good results. Looking at the Wireshark capture I see no fragmentation anymore.p  pDoing the same test over IPv4 I dont need to change the default UDP datagram size I dont need to use l option to get good results.p  pSo my conclusion is that fragmentation over IPv6 is responsible for poor bandwidth performances.p  pAnyway, Im wondering what really happens when setting UDP datagram size to 1450 over IPv6.  Why do I have fragmentation over IPv6 and not over IPv4 with default value for UDP datagram size  Moreover, why do I have no fragmentation when reducing the UDP datagram size to 1450p  pThank you.p
Positive 2548 pI have an RFID receiver that constantly sends UDP packets to port 5757.

Positive 2548 pIm currently developing a simple onlinemultiplayer game via .NET sockets in C.p  pMore precisely Im trying to create the network communication structure around this game  not so much the game itself. For now I have a working HTTPServer which handles basic requests, like create a new game instance party, join an existing party etc.p  pThis is working fine, but I dont really know how to handle communication inside a game instance. From my understanding there should be both, reliable communication and unreliable communication. Like sending a kick player, pause game, get player list request reliable and sending inputs, receiving snapshots unreliable.p  pDoes this mean it would make sense to have two seperate sockets udp and tcp running on different ports, so I actually have two servers to communicate with per game instance Or is there a way to achieve both, guaranteed delivery and unreliable delivery via one single udp socketp  pNote emIm not really aiming for ordered packet arriving, so reliable for me mainly means making sure the packet actually reaches its destinationemp  pNote2 emI dont really want to bother the http server with this gameinstance specific reliable stuff, in my opinion it would be nicer if the game instances could handle this by themselvesemp  pI saw a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32083698usingtcpandudpforjavagameThis question herea being similar, but the accepted answer does not really help me.

In fact, UDP is used for receiving the job message from another server, while TCP receives messages from multiple RFID receivers.p  pSo Ive googled for days to see what approach I can use, and I found the followingsp  pa hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms738620vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms738620vvs.85.aspxa a hrefhttpwww.masterraghu.comsubjectsnpintroductionunixnetworkprogrammingv1.3ch08lev1sec15.html relnofollowhttpwww.masterraghu.comsubjectsnpintroductionunixnetworkprogrammingv1.3ch08lev1sec15.htmlap  pHowever, I still cannot come up with the clear flow that how I can start the server application without selecting either TCP or UDP by the command line arguement i.e. I just want to start the winsock server program with creating both TCP and UDP sockets and then wait for connections. p  pSo, according to the above two links, how can I do for the purpose I stated above i.e. how can I initialize the TCP and UDP sockets when I start the program and then go into the while loop for waiting the connections Thanksp  pEdited 20150918 412pm HKTp  pIve tried to combine the examples in two links provided above, but it is work for TCP while not in UDP. What is the problem for UDP according to the following server and client codes Thanksp  pserver.cppp  precodedefine WIN32LEANANDMEAN define WINSOCKDEPRECATEDNOWARNINGS define CRTSECURENOWARNINGS

Positive 2548 pI have a question, is it possible to sendto information from one process which is initialized on UDP to another process initialized on TCP  this is all in the same .c I have one process which receive information on UDP and this one has to send this information locally to the TCP one and I dont know how to connect  I know you cant connect with udp, I mean just send the datagram them. Can anyone help mep  pThank you.p

Positive 2548 pI was looking for an answer on my question on google and also here, but a didnt find a proper answer.p  pSo here is the context I have a software running on some server without firewall in one subnet. There is another software running on some PC in a different subnet. Both subnets are connected to a gateway server. All computers are running CentOS or RHEL. On the gateway server, there is a firewall, preventing multicast traffic from leaving the one subnet and allow clients from outside to connect to computers inside this subnet. Therefore xinetd is used. The computer from outside needs to send a packet to a specific port, the computer on the inside answers to another specific port depending on the sender. So there is no need for the gateway to keep track of senderreceiver relations. It just needs to forward UDP on specific ports to specific computers from one subnet to another.  p  pSo I added one service in etcservices for one directionp  precodeudpgateway    6000udp codepre  pAnd created the according configuration file in etcxinetd.dgateway likep  precodeservice udpgateway    disable                  no   sockettype              dgram   protocol                 udp   wait                     no   user                     root   redirect                 192.168.1.1 6000  Server inside the 192.168.1.0 subnet  codepre  pNow the problem is, that the server doesnt open an UDPport to listen on netstat nulp says. When I change the protocol to TCP and the sockettype to stream, it works. But I need this for UDP.p  pIs it possible that this is not possible for UDP Or is netstat just not showing the ports Or is my xinetdconfiguration missing somethingp  pThanks in advance, every hint is appreciated. p  pBennyp

Positive 2548 pI have captured SNMP trapsinforms from my network a mix of V1 and V2c and I wish to write a camel pipeline to replay them in order to test my trap processing engine. In order to do this, I must resend the traps with the source IP of the original sender since that is part of the criteria for identification and correct processing of a trap. p  pI thought I would send the resulting UDP datagrams using Netty although Im open to writing a standalone component or using Mina or any other approach, but the use of the Camel SNMP component does not immediately seem appropriate.

I have looked through the netty component source in camel and was not able to see how I might use it unmodified to use a raw socket. p  pDoes anyone out there have an example of using netty with raw sockets that they could share, bonus points if it includes some reference to camel or better still if it calls out a way I can do this with something more highlevel than a raw socket ie a regular UDP datagram with some kind of modifier to set the source IP.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 2548 pPerhaps I am demonstrating my ignorance of some oftused feautre of C or the .NET framework, but I would like to know if there is a nativelysupported way to create a type alias like codeEmailAddresscode which aliases codestringcode but such that I can extend it with my own methods like codebool Validatecodep  pI know of the codeusing x  Some.Typecode aliases but these are not global nor do they provide type safety, i.e. one could swap out an ordinary codestringcode for the using alias in the current file. I would like my codeEmailAddresscode to be its own type, independent and not interchangeable with the codestringcode type that it shadows.p  pMy current solution is to generate codepublic sealed partial EmailAddress  IEquatableltEmailAddressgt, IXmlSerializablecode classes with a T4 template generating the boilerplate implicit string conversion operators and other such things. This is fine with me for now and gives me a lot of flexibility but at the back of my mind it seems silly that I have to generate such copious amounts of boilerplate code to do something as simple as creating a strong type alias.p  pMaybe this is not possible other than with code generation, but I am curious if others have attempted something similar with their designs and what your experiences have been. If nothing else, perhaps this could serve as a good usecase for such an alias feature in a hypothetical future version of C. Thanksp  pEDIT The real value that I want out of this is to be able to get type safety with primitive types that represent different typesformats for data. For instance, an codeEmailAddresscode and a codeSocialSecurityNumbercode and a codePhoneNumbercode, all of which use codestringcode as their underlying type but which are not interchangeable types in and of themselves. I think this gets you much more readable and selfdocumenting code, not to mention added benefits of more method overload possibilities that are less ambiguous.p

Negative 2548 pIm working on a DelphiWIN32 application that uses an SQL Server database as backend, using ADO to access the data. There are many users who use this application, but one user is using a special setup they have multiple database schemas and every schema contains the complete datamodel for the application. Every schema also has a database user which defaults to the specific schema. They also have a separate login account for every database user, allowing them to control which schema to use simply by using a different login account in the connection string. They use this setup to have a single, centralized database which supports multiple offices. Normally, every office would have its own database but here, every office has their own schema.p  pI like this solution that theyre using. I havent thought about this before simply because the application is normally used by single offices. Only this customer had a need to have a centralized database. The application works just fine, even though its unaware of these schemas, simply because the login account will default to the correct schema.p  pBut now theyve asked if its possible to change the code in a way that the user can select the schema to which they want to connect. Thus, a user needs to be able to switch between schemas in the application. And I dont want to rewrite the code to support these schemas simply because I need to keep the SQL code database neutral. So Im looking for a way to switch a user to another schema without much impact on the code itself.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 2548 pI have checked out now a local working copy of a codebase that lives in an svn repo.  Its a big Java project that I use Eclipse to develop in.  Eclipse of course builds everything on the fly, in its own way with all the binaries ending up in b[project root]binb.  Thats perfectly fine with me, for development, but when the build runs on the build server, it looks quite a lot different maven build, binaries end up in a different directory structure, etc.p  pSometimes I need to recreate the build server environment on my local development system to debug the build or what have you, so I usually end up downloading an entirely new working copy into a new workspace and running the build from there prevents cluttering my development workspace with all the build artifacts and dirtying up the working copy.  Of course sometimes Im interested in running the full build on code that I dont want to check in yet, so I will manually copy over the development workspace onto the build workspace.  Besides taking a lot of extra time copying a lot of files that I dont actually need just overlaying the new over the old, this also screws up my svn metadata, meaning that I cant check in changes from that build workspace working copy, and I often end up having to redownload the code to get it back into a known state.p  pSo Im thinking I make my svn working copy a local git repo, then check out the indevelopment code from the svn working copygit master, into the local build workspace.  Then I can build, revert my changes, have all the advantages of a version controlled working copy in the build workspace.  Then if I need to make changes to the build, push those back into the git master which is also a svn working copy, then check them into the main svn repo.p  precode main svn repo lt            svn working copy      lt                             svn dev workspace             nonsvnversioned                               git master                   build workspace                                          git working copy                                                              codepre  pJust switching everything to git would obviously be better, but, big company, too many people using svn, too costly to change everything, etc.  Were stuck with svn as the main repo for now.p  pBTW, I know there is a maven plugin for Eclipse and everything, Im mainly interested to know if there is a way to maintain a workspace that is both a git working copy and an svn working copy.  Actually any distributed version control system would probably work hg possibly.

I use control input [Distance, Vector], and I have an array of 76 laser ranges [Distance,Theta] as my measurement input.p  pI am having trouble knowing how to decide on the covariance to use in my Gaussian function. Because my measurements are uncertain The laser is about 1cm accurate at lt 1meter, but can be up to 5cm accurate at ranges higher I do not know how to create the function to estimate the probability of this.

This should work no I would appreciate some help from people understanding Kalman Filters, because I think I may be missing something.p

Negative 2548 pIm working with an application that uses JBPM 3.1 and MySQL.  The core problem is that there are processes instances with variables that contain an older version of an external, nonJBPM codeSerializablecode class.  When the main application is upgraded, these processes instances cause an exception to be thrown by JBPM since the SUID of a specific class instance has changed in the main application.p  pI believe I have a method for fixing the deserialization process using the technique described in the followingp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions795470howtodeserializeanobjectpersitedinadbnowwhentheobecthasdifferentseHow to deserialize an object persited in a db now when the obect has different serialVersionUIDap  pHowever, my problem is figuring out where in MySQL JBPM stores process instance variables, so I can write a program that can interate over all the variables for all instances, an reserialize the variables so the offending class will have the new SUID, so JBPM can operate against the processes.p  pMy initial looking at the JBPM tables, it appears that the JBPMBYTEARRAY andor JBPMBYTEBLOCK may be the tables to operate against.  However, Im unsure how to proceed.  Im guessing each process variable is stored in a wrapping container class.  Is that class codeorg.jbpm.context.exe.VariableInstancecode  Or is it something elsep  pI figure if I have the proper jar files in the class path, and I know what the main class instance is that JBPM uses to store process variables in MySQL, I can deserialize the class which will fix the SUID problem with the embedded problem class instance, and reserialize the class back.  Since JBPM documentation does mention stuff about converters, Im unsure if I have to replicate the conversion process JPBM does when deserializing, or if standard java deserialization is enough.p

So, what I need to do is to erase all the rectangles between frames, so the number of them stays the same and they look like they are moving. I tried doing this by just drawing the background again, by calling code[myNsBox display]code before calling codeexecuteFramecode, but that made it seem as though no rectangles were being drawn. Calling it after did the same thing, so did switching in codesetNeedsDisplaycode instead of display. I cannot figure this one out, any help would be appreciated.p  pBy the way, an additional thing is that when I try to run my code for executing the frames, without trying to erase the rectangles in between, all that happens is that 100 more rectangles are drawn. Even if I have requested that 1000 be drawn, or 10,000. Then though, if I leave the window and come back to it immediately, time is not a factor here, the page updates and the rectangles are there. I attempted to overcome that by with         code[box setNeedsDisplayInRectarray[i]]code which worked in a strange way, causing it to update every frame, but erasing portions of the rectangles. Any help in this would also be appreciated.p

I can get the X,Y coordinates of the webview where the click occurred, but I cant figure out how to get the current zoom level. Also, Im not sure what math will be required to translate the X,Y,scale to actual pixel coordinates.p  pIs the webview the right view for me to usep  pEDIT Using the link suggested below, I got the zoom functionality working. I still cant figure out how to place a drawable marker on top of the TouchImageView, much less get the coordinates that were actually touched on the image.p

Negative 2548 pWeve had problems recently where developers commit code to SVN that doesnt pass unit tests, fails to compile on all platforms, or even fails to compile on their own platform. While this is all picked up by our CI server Cruise Control, and weve instituted processes to try to stop it from happening, wed really like to be able to stop the rogue commits from happening in the first place.p  pBased on a few other questions around here, it seems to be a Bad Idea to force this as a precommit hook on the server side mostly due to the length of time required to build  run the tests. I did some Googling and found this all devs use TortoiseSVNp  pa hrefhttpcfbill.blogspot.com201003precommitforceunittestswithout.htmlhttpcfbill.blogspot.com201003precommitforceunittestswithout.htmlap  pWhich would solve at least two of the problems it wouldnt build on Unix, but it doesnt reject the commit if it fails. So my questionsp  ul liIs there a way to make a precommit hook in TortoiseSVN cause the commit to failli liIs there a better way to do what Im trying to do in generalli ul  pI appreciate any and all feedback.p

Negative 2548 pWith Jersey, I am currently using the Gson library to convert my pojo to json back and forth. However, Ive discovered Jackson to be a lot faster so we are switching to this. p  pI already have a Gson custom Provider and Reader, and will now create a modified version for Jackson. p  pBut during development, it would be good if I could swap them but is this possible Since I mark the json provider with produces and consumes I dont think Jersey could resolve which one to use if there were two providers, each with the above annotations for the same type, in this case APPLICATIONJSON.p  pIs it possible to specify multiple Json providers, and then swap them in some config file web.xml p  pI know if I created a Json Wrapper object I could code to an interface and using spring to swap implementations easily jackson imp vs gson imp but this would mean i wouldnt be doing it the Jax RS way.

Negative 2548 pI am working on a project that involves sending some very small encrypted messages over a high performance socket connection using UDP.  I have read in other posts that the bare minimum number of bytes that AES should encrypt with a 128 bit key is the block size, which is 16 bytes.p  pBut, the real question is  is that enough to provide good protection  I am thinking about using a scheme that would add some random data to the message and get a random number between 1 and 12 which would be used to place the 4 bytes of real data within the block.  The zero byte in the block would be the random number which is the starting position in the block of the 4 bytes.  After building the block, it would be encrypted with AES using a 128 bit key.  The data does not have any value after the client disconnects, and connections should not last more than 24  48 hours at the most.  Will something like this work, or should I send more data to make it harder for a potential adversary to breakp  pI also will be encrypting other data that does need to be protected after the user disconnects like credit card numbers, bank account info, password hash, etc.  I am planning on using AES with 256 bit keys for that.  So, same question for this case  what is the minimum number of bytes that should be encrypted to provide good protection for 256 bit keys  Will 16 bytes suffice, or would 32 be betterp  pI am planning on using bouncy castles fast AES engine for the small messages.

What I want for the latter view controller is to add items coming from a text field then save it in an array through a button click.

Negative 2548 pI have a scenario where I want to put four identical Gridviews on the same page.  They will be on different tabs in an Ajax TabControl.  They show the same source data, but there are four corresponding groups of source data in a common underlying table.  So I want to show Group 1 on Tab 1, Group 2 on Tab 2, etc.  These Gridviews contain complicated controls, so I would prefer to use the same data source for all of them to avoid unnecessary repetition.  The Insert and Update commands are completely identical.  p  pSo in theory I could build the Select command in such a way that I could filter the data based on the GridView that is binding to the SQLDataSource.  The problem is that if I use the same SQLDataSource for all the Gridviews, I cannot find a way to have each GridView tell the SQLDataSource which one is calling it.  I am thinking maybe this is not possible, because the SQLDataSource binds first before it knows what is binding to it, but Im not sure.  Can anyone think of a way to do thisp

Negative 2548 pI have built a UITableViewController for my app which interacts with my core data model. Its primary purpose is to be pushed onto the navigation controller and display a list of entities and allow me to edit  select and drill down into info them etc...p  pHowever, elsewhere in my app, I now want to modally display a simple picker to select one of these entities. I think the best way to implement this is building a protocol to handle the picker that can send messages back to my delegate about whether the user cancelled or selected an entity etc...p  pAs so much of the coding will be the same, my question is this is it possibleor in any way advisable to enable the UITableViewController as a protocolp  pi.e. when displayed normally, it behaves as it does currently a standard subclass of UIViewController but then is also able to be presented modally by a delegate and pass messages to a delegatep  pKeen to her thoughts on best practicep

I am coming from a CC embedded firmware background and this newfangled way of doing things is going to take some getting used to. It seems that there is no such thing as a main loop in Android, that everything is eventdriven... I also understand that by default all code you write operates on the GUI thread, and I should probably make a new thread to execute the equivalent of a main loop...p  pSo far what I have is an implementation of the AsyncTask class whos doInBackground method contains an infinite loop my main loop, I create an instance of this class and run it immediately when my app starts. The problem I am having is in the interaction between this thread and the user interface... when something occurs in my main loop thread and I want to update the GUI understand that I must call publishProgress, which is executed on the GUI thread. There are a few problems with this, primarily that many things I have tried to do in this onProgressUpdate method do not work, or do not occur in a predictable amount of time.p  pMy question, is there a better way to accomplish what I am trying to do In general, what do most people do when they have code that they want to run periodically andor continuously while their application is running, code that must interact with the user interface in a timely manner by timely I mean with zero delay.p  pThank you.p  precodepublic class MainLoopThread extends AsyncTaskltVoid, Void, Voidgt      Override     protected Void doInBackgroundVoid... arg0              whiletrue                      Do stuff              Update GUI             publishProgress                       protected void onProgressUpdateVoid...voids              Update GUI       codepre

Negative 2548 pIm searching a javascript library that offers secure encryption. The client has to generate a key and all data uploaded to the server is encrypted, all data downloaded is decrypted. I need an authenticated encryption scheme, just CTR or CBC isnt enough.p  pI heard about sjcl, but it seems that sjcl only can encrypt the whole data at once. I didnt find a way to encrypt the data blockwise. Because the uploaded files can be very large, this approach isnt feasible. I need something like the java crypto interface with two methods update and final.p  pI found the nodeJS crypto library that seems to do what I need, but I dont know how to use it on browser side.p  pI found google cryptojs, but this library doesnt seem to offer authenticated encryption but only the standard modes.p  pIs there a way to encrypt data blockwise with sjcl To use the nodeJS crypto library on browser side To use authenticated encryption with cryptojs Or is there another secure javascript library that offers what I needp

For example if I press a key when there is only half a second left, the value code0.5code would be taken from codetv1code and copied to another variable. Then the program would only wait for half a second for input, instead of the full second. This didnt work, however, because codetv1code only ever equals code1code or code0code.p

The requirements for the software is that no plain text strings existNo encryption needed, just mangling and Im attmping to figure out the path of least resistance for this requirement. Obfuscation and mangling of class names is covered through relatively easy to acquire tools but the string mangling seems to be a harder hurdle to jump. p  pI am comfortable with post processing of the software if that is the standard answer. Are their tools already written to do this or do I need to hack up my own scripts to munge stringsp  pAlso I understand that mangling of the strings at rest is not really true security.

Negative 2548 pI have a web application running using Struts2 framework. The requirement is p  pa. Users perform various transactions.  b. Each transaction needs to be printed.  c. Each transaction has a jrxml attached to it configured using a property file.  d. Once the user completes the transaction, print should happen seamlessly. p  pPrinting can be done in two ways.  1. If a Network printer is configured for that particular user and the transaction, the print will be fired in that particular network printer.  2. If a Local Printer attached to the desktop is configured for the user, the print should be fired in his local printer. p  pI have achieved the first part network printing using Java Print Services. But need a solution around the local printing requirements.  For local printing, once the user completes the txn, the report should be printed to his local printer, without any user intervention.  User may have more than one printer installed to his local machine, based on the txn type routing will happen to the appropriate local printer. I have looked for options using JavaScript but not getting a clear solution, dont want any popup or iframe to be used.p  pAny help or suggestions would be of great help.p

Negative 2548 pIn order to overcome the apparent 4 minute idle connection timeout on the Azure load balancer, it seems necessary to send some data down the pipe to the client every now and again to keep the connection from being regarded as idle.p  pOur controller is set up as an AsyncController, and it fires several different asynchronous methods on other objects, all of which are set up to use IO Completion Ports.

Negative 2548 pI think Im missing something very simple. I have a byte array holding deflated data written into it using a Deflaterp  precodedeflateoutData, 0, BLOCKSIZE, SYNCFLUSH codepre  pThe reason I didnt just use GZIPOutputStream was because there were 4 threads variable that each were given a block of data and each thread compressed its own block before storing that compressed data into a global byte array. If I used GZIPOutputStream it messes up the format because each little block has a header and trailer and is its own gzip data I only want to compress it.p  pSo in the end, Ive got this byteArray, outData, thats holding all of my compressed data but Im not really sure how to wrap it. GZIPOutputStream writes from an buffer with uncompressed data, but this array is all set. Its already compressed and Im just hitting a wall trying to figure out how to get it into a form. p  pEDIT Ok, bad wording on my part. Im writing it to output, not a file, so that it could be redirected if needed. A really simple example is that p  precodecat file.txt  java Jzip  gzip d  cmp file.txt codepre  pshould return 0. The problem right now is if I write this byte array as is to output, its just raw compressed data. I think gzip needs all this extra information. p  pIf theres an alternative method, that would be fine to. The whole reason its like this is because I needed to use multiple threads. Otherwise I would just call GZIPOutputStream.p  pDOUBLE EDIT Since the comments provide a lot of good insight, another method is that I just have a bunch of uncompressed blocks of data that were originally one long stream. If gzip can read concatenated streams, if I took those blocks and kept them in order and gave each one to a thread that calls GZIPOutputStream on its own block, then took the results and concatenated them. In essence, each block now has header, the compressed info, and trailer. Would gzip recognize that if I concatenated themp  pExample p  precodecat file.txt Hello world How are you Im ready to set fire to this assignment.  java Testcase lt file.txt gt file.txt.gz codepre  pSo I accept it from input. Inside the program, the stream is split up into Hello world How are you Im ready to set fire to this assignment theyre not strings, its just an array of bytes this is just illustrationp  pSo Ive got these three blocks of bytes, all uncompressed. I give each of these blocks to a thread, which usesp  precodepublic static class DGZIPOutputStream extends GZIPOutputStream      public DGZIPOutputStreamOutputStream out, boolean flush throws IOException              superout, flush          public void setDictionarybyte[] b              def.setDictionaryb          public void updateCRCbyte[] input              crc.updateinput                              codepre  pAs you can see, the only thing here is that Ive set the flush to SYNCFLUSH so I can get the alignment right and have the ability to set the dictionary. If each thread were to use DGZIPOutputStream which Ive tested and it works for one long continuous input, and I concatenated those three blocks now compressed each with a header and trailer, would gzip d file.txt.gz workp  pIf thats too weird, ignore the dictionary completely. It doesnt really matter. I just added it in while I was at it.p

Negative 2548 pI have a realworld problem which Ill try to abstract into an illustrative example.p  pSo imagine I have data objects in a tree, where parent objects can access children, and children can access parentsp  precode Interfaces interface IParentltTChildgt  ListltTChildgt Children  interface IChildltTParentgt  TParent Parent    Classes class Top  IParentltMiddlegt  class Middle  IParentltBottomgt, IChildltTopgt  class Bottom  IChildltMiddlegt    Usage var top  new Top var middles  top.Children  ListltMiddlegt foreach var middle in middles      var bottoms  middle.Children  ListltBottomgt     foreach var bottom in bottoms          var middle  bottom.Parent  Access the parent         var top  middle.Parent  Access the grandparent       codepre  pAll three data objects have properties that are persisted in two data stores e.g. a database and a web service, and they need to reflect and synchronise with the stores. Some objects only request from the web service, some only write to it.p  pstrongData Mapperstrongp  pMy favourite pattern for data access is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd569757.aspxid0400052 relnofollowData Mappera, because it completely separates the data objects themselves from the communication with the data storep  precodeclass TopMapper      public Top FetchByIdint id          var top  new TopDataStore.TopDataByIdid         top.Children  MiddleMapper.FetchForTopTop         return Top        class MiddleMapper      public Middle FetchByIdint id           var middle  new MiddleDataStore.MiddleDataByIdid          middle.Parent  TopMapper.FetchForMiddlemiddle          middle.Children  BottomMapper.FetchForMiddlebottom          return middle       codepre  pThis way I can have one mapper per data store, and build the object from the mapper I want, and then save it back using the mapper I want.p  pThere is a circular reference here, but I guess thats not a problem because most languages can just store memory references to the objects, so there wont actually be infinite data.p  pThe problem with this is that every time I want to construct a new codeTopcode, codeMiddlecode or codeBottomcode, it needs to build the entire object tree within that objects codeParentcode or codeChildrencode property, with all the data store requests and memory usage that that entails. And in real life my tree is much bigger than the one represented here, so thats a problem.p  pstrongRequests in the objectstrongp  pIn this the objects request their codeParentcodes and codeChildrencode themselvesp  precodeclass Middle      private ListltBottomgt children  null  cache     public ListltBottomgt Children          get              children  children  BottomMapper.FetchForMiddlethis             return children                  set              BottomMapper.UpdateForMiddlethis, value             children  value                codepre  pI think this is an example of the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd569757.aspxid0400058 relnofollowrepository patterna. Is that correctp  pThis solution seems neat  the data only gets requested from the data store when you need it, and thereafter its stored in the object if you want to request it again, avoiding a further request.p  pHowever, I have two different data sources. Theres a database, but theres also a web service, and I need to be able to create an object from the web service and save it back to the database and then request it again from the database and update the web service.p  pThis also makes me uneasy because the data objects themselves are no longer ignorant of the data source. Weve introduced a new dependency, not to mention a circular dependency, making it harder to test. And the objects now mask their communication with the database.p  pstrongOther solutionsstrongp  pAre there any other solutions which could take care of the multiple stores problem but also mean that I dont need to build  request all the data every timep

Negative 2548 pI have an application that distributes work to multiple threads. Sometimes one thread takes too much CPU load and all other threads suffer of that. What can I do to manage threads in such way that if one thread is going up with using CPU then just pause it, or slice it down to   make all threads load to be more or less even.p  pstrongUpdatedstrong My tasks are independent. Not sure if is possible to add performance counters for each thread and measure load. If thread goes out of limits than pause it until later time.p  pstrongUpdatedstrong Problem with using TPL load balancing is that my threads are STA. Kind of solution is to create home brewed load balancing following well known algorithms like roundrobin load balancing. p

Negative 2548 pIn my application, I want any insert to the database to be executed as soon as a request comes for writing some data.p  pI am using InnoDB engine.p  pSince insertion requires an exclusive lock, it is possible that while current read query has a shared lock, some other reads might come which again have a shared lock and the write operation might have to wait for a long time.p  pI want that when there is a write operation in queue, no read operation gets a shared lock. As soon as the reads which were initiated before the current write request are completed, the write operation should be executed. After that all other read operations should take place.p  pHow can this be implementedp  h2Edith2  pSince I am using InnoDB tables and I am not implementing table lock, there should not be a conflict between select and insert.

Negative 2548 pI was wanting to lock down specific tags in an codeSVNcode repository as soon as they are sent to testing. It seems the codesvn lockcode command only works on individual files, so this is insufficient as even recursively locking files in the dir would leave the dir roots open for file commits.

Negative 2548 pI have three web services exposing their APIs.p  pInternally they are running on different ports but on the same server.

Unfortunatly I have no experience with OAuth2 so Id like to know if theres a way to use one access token for all three webservices without requiring a different auth for each service.p  pWhat I want to make is to allow a consumer to be able to get the authorization once and then access all services under api.domain.com thats just a reverse proxy forwarding request to our internal services.p  pThen Id need to create a simple interface to perform certain operations on those services.

Negative 2548 pI was asked this as a brain teaser in one of my classes but was unable to figure it out Wasnt a homework question, just a teaser one of the TAs gave us to think about.p  pYou are given a rod with a list of n points to cut at, for example [1,5,11], and the total length of the rod, for example 20. You are also told that the expense of cutting a rod is equivalent to that of the length of the rod. We want to find the minimum cost of cutting the rod at all the given cuts and the sequence of those cuts that would lead to the optimal cost. p  pFor example, to cut a rod of length 20 at position 5, it would cost you 20 and you would end up with 2 logs, one with length 5 and one with length 15.p  pOr in another example, if you cut a rod of length 25 at positions 5 and then at position 10, it would cost you 25 to cut it at position 5, leaving you with a length 5 rod and a length 20 rod, and then cost you another 20 to cut it at position 10, giving you the total cost of cutting at the two positions at 45. However if you cut the rod at position 10 and then position 5, it would cost you 25  10  35. p  pIn the end, we want to codereturn the minimum cost of cutting the rod at all the given cuts and the sequence of those cuts that would lead to the optimal cost.codep  pI attempted to come up with a recursive solution for this problem, but kept coming up emptyhanded. Thoughts Any help is appreciated. Thanks  p

The wordpresssite has now been moved into a folder, but I would like to setup a redirect from all the previous URLs to the new URLs for SEO reasons. p  pSo far I found a temporary solution that is far from perfect.

L means this is the Last rule   RewriteRule . 1.php [L] codepre  pAnd then Ive created the different files called the same as the previously URLs with the .phpextension, which then is removed due to my .htaccessfile. In the top of each file, I have inserted a p  precode  ltphp headerLocation THENEWURL gt codepre  pIt works, but its ugly as Betty    Recently, I encountered an error due to this temporary, stupid fix to my problem.

Negative 2548 pI would like a rectangular DIV to have a dropshadow around it on all four sides.p  pNow I might be able to get something like I want by using a container div and have one drop shadow with positive and one with negative values I havent seen what I could push. And because this is being done in boilerplate code, I could have a series of nested DIVs with different border colors, the old preCSS way. Some way I might be able to make four dropshadows for four DIVs. See, for instance, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions253868cssshadowson3sidesCSS shadows on 3 sidesa.p  pHowever, all the solutions I have seen, or seen evidence of in searching, smell like duct tape. Are drop shadows strongly enough designed for 2 sides that 4 sides cannot be gracefully implemented without duct tapep  pIll use duct tape if I have to, but Id rather find out if theres a good way to do it before choosing among brands of duct tape.p

Negative 2548 pI am pretty newbie in the NLP area and apologize that my question may be silly or incorrect. I look forward for any assistance that can give me the motion vector to the right direction.p  pNowadays I am working on my thesis and there is an important part of it  natural language query parser. Previously I had some experience with search engine algorithms. But now I want my system to understand some types of queries, and be able to convert it, roughly speaking, into database query language to perform structured search. For example for the query my friends who live in Russia the system simply should look in the table people and select who have country  Russia.p  pI am clearly understand that the structured search is not as simple NLPproblem as, for example, spam filtering, but there are plenty of such systems born nowadays Siri, Google Now, Facebook Graph Search. They are able to understand the query and not just give the ranked result list like classic search engines do but proper presentation for the ruested type of information. I was interested in how they work inside, but could not find enough information.p  pI would appreciate for any information, any references and books that could help me in my researching of these systems and progress in my thesis. Preferably those can be applied in practice, not Ministry of Defence closed developments p  pEnglish is not my native language, sorry for mistakes, I hope you understand my issues.p

Negative 2548 pWere developing a tracking system that makes 3 ajax calls in row within the WordPress environment using the WordPress AJAX API and on the 3rd call it refreshes the page. p  pIm noticing that sometimes on of my data entry attempts is failing on the back end and I am assuming possibly incorrectly that this is happening because our final Ajax call completes before the prior one gets the 200 OK clear, and breaks the connection, which means the data never gets stored. p  pNow I am under the impression that as soon as an jQuery.ajaxtype POST call is issued I could immediately close the page and still my server side that I posted to would receive, and process the data, regardless of what happens the the parrent connection.p  pBut my data testing is showing some data is not getting entered consistently.

Negative 2548 pIm constructing a plot using bargraph.CI from sciplot. The xaxis represents a categorical variable, so the values of this variable are the names for the different positions on the xaxis. Unfortunately these names are long, so at default settings, some of them just disappear. I solved this problem by splitting them into multiple lines by injecting n where needed. This basically worked, but because the names are now multiline, they look too close to the xaxis. I need to move them farther away. Howp  pI know I can do this with mgp, but that affects the yaxis too.p  pI know I can set axisnamesFALSE in my call to barplot.CI, then use axis to create a separate xaxis. In fact, Im already doing that, but only to make the xaxis extend farther than it would by default see my code below. Then I could give the xaxis its own mgp parameter that would not affect the yaxis. But as far as I can tell, axis is well set up for ordinal or continuous variables and doesnt seem to work great for categorical variables.

However how this PHP file would look like I mean , i can write a php script that accepts an emidem as input ,makes the right SQL queries to look for the events and create a json file with them. But how do i return it to my htmljquery page thoughp  pOr should the GET request target only XMLJSON files The way i see what i described till now is that my jquery makes a POST request to my server with the id and the server makes a POST request to my web page with the events. Is not exactly a GET ...p

Negative 2548 pProbably, many thousands of new GUIDs are generated every second worldwide. Some of them might be in use only for a second and then sink into oblivion forever. Others could be more lucky and last for a longer time but are confined to a single database or computer system, and are not of a general interest. p  pAnd only a small portion of GUIDs are elite, born to have a worldwide fame and possibly live forever. Sometimes they are called emwellknownem GUIDs. Of course, this notion is imprecise and somewhat subjective. Sometimes, knowledge of a certain wellknow GUID can give you power or open doors to access certain APIs. p  pOne example is a socalled God Mode GUID in Windows a hrefhttpgoogle.comsearchqED7BA4708E54465E825C99712043E01CED7BA4708E54465E825C99712043E01Ca.p  pAnother one is a hrefhttpgoogle.comsearchqDF8395B5A4BA450bA77CA9A47762C520DF8395B5A4BA450bA77CA9A47762C520a that is only mentioned on couple of paged on the Web, but is very useful if you want to invoke some CLR debugging or profiling APIs from a managed code.p  pSome of them like a hrefhttpgoogle.comsearchq53D29EF7377C4D14864BEB3A8576935953D29EF7377C4D14864BEB3A85769359a are identifiers of system devices that could be useful when searching for missing drivers.p  pI am curious to know if there is a published list, or some communitysupported database including some hopefully, most wellknown GUIDs with their description, kind e.g. COM CLSID, system device ID, ..., publisher, obsoletedeprecated status, and other pertinent information p  pPersonally, I have a list of a hundred or so GUIDs that proved to be quite useful on several occasions.

Negative 2548 pI am facing an issue in an iOS application that uses a UIWebView to render HTML5 code that is part of the application bundle.  p  pThis HTML5 code makes ajax requests to our backend which may potentially have sensitive data in them.  This is all done over HTTPS and our application never stores the sensitive data.  However, when doing security testing for the application, we found that http post requests where being stored in a local SQL Lite database cache.db as of iOS 5. p  pIt was easy to manage that, by setting the NSURLCache global object to have zero disk storage, and deleting the file when appropriate.  p  pNow however, it looks like in iOS 6.1 Apple has changed the implementation again, and the data is being stored in cache.dbwal.  I have limited knowledge of SQL Lite, but I think this is a file created when SQL Lite is initialized with certain options.  p  pAny suggestions as to a fix  p

Negative 2548 pI have a list of images that is being populated by an ObservableCollection. This is done by binding the ItemsSource of the ListBox to the Collection in the code behind. Everything is working properly, although the list of images that results does not look pretty. Currently the images are being wrapped in a horizontal WrapPanel, which is the functionality I would like to keep. The problem though is that depending on whether the image was taken from CameraCaptureTask is landscape or portrait mode, it is either very wide or tall when presented in the view. I would like to be able to resize these images while keeping the aspect ratio in tact. Perhaps setting a limit on either the width or height being no more than 128. How exactly would I do this in the following code Also, would the image know to keep the aspect ratio For instance, would a portrait image know to have a max height of 128 while maintaining a width of something less than 128 to keep the aspect ratiop  pMainPage.xamlp  precodeltListBox xNameRecent ItemsSourceBinding Margin8                      SelectionChangedrecentSelectionChanged toolkitTiltEffect.IsTiltEnabledTrue                      ItemContainerStyleStaticResource MyStylegt                 ltListBox.ItemsPanelgt                     ltItemsPanelTemplategt                         lttoolkitWrapPanel OrientationHorizontal gt                     ltItemsPanelTemplategt                 ltListBox.ItemsPanelgt             ltListBoxgt codepre

Negative 2548 pSo, as a sort of exercise for myself, Im writing a little async script loader utility think require.js, head.js, yepnope.js, and have run across a little bit of a conundrum. First, the basic syntax is like thisp  precodeusingModelsSomeModel, function    callback when all dependencies loaded  codepre  pNow, I want to know, when this call is made, what file Im in. I could do it with an ajax call, so that I can mark a flag after the content loads, but before I eval it to mark that all using calls are going to be for a specific file, then unset the flag immediately after the eval I know eval is evil, but in this case its javascript in the first place, not json, so its not AS evil. Im pretty sure this would get what I need, however I would prefer to do this with a script tag for a few reasons p  ol liIts semantically more correctli liEasier to find scripts for debugging unique file names are much easier to look through than anonymous script blocks and debugger statementsli liCrossdomain requests. I know I could try to use XDomainRequest, but most servers arent going to be set up for that, and I want the ability to reference external scripts on CDNs. li ol  pI tried something that almost got me what I needed. I keep a list of every time using is called. When one of the scripts loads, I take any of those using references and incorporate them into the correct object for the file that just loaded, and clear the global list. This actually seems to work alright in Firefox and Chrome, but fails in IE because the load events seem to go off at weird times a jQuery reference swallowed a reference to another type and ended up showing it as a dependency. I thought I could latch on to the interactive readystate, but it doesnt appear to ever happen. p  pSo now I come asking if anybody here has any thoughts on this. If yall want, I can post the code, but its still very messy and probably hard to read.p  pEdit Additional usagesp  precodealiasing and multiple dependencies using.aliasajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.10.2jquery.min.js, jQuery  using[jQuery, ModelsSomeModel], function    should run after both jQuery and SomeModel have been loaded and run   css and conditionals using some nonexistant variables here using.css src IEFix, conditionally browser  MSIE ampamp version lt 9  should include the IEFix.css file if the browser is IE8 or below codepre  pand to expound more on my response below, consider this to be file A and consider the jquery alias from before to be there stillp  precodeusing[jQuery, B], function    console.logThis should be last after both jQuery and B have loaded   console.logtypeof  codepre  pThen this would be Bp  precodeusingC, function    console.logThis should be second  codepre  pAnd finally, Cp  precodeconsole.logThis should be first codepre  pThe output should bep  precodeThis should be first This should be second This should be last after both jQuery and B have loaded [Object Object] codepre

Negative 2548 pI have some images that I create using data from a MySQL database. The data in the database are a title and a description.

I reckon there is a way of just flipping one image horizontally, in stead of using two images. As is, I can move Packman around. Now I need to add the bit that makes Packman face leftright depending on the direction the mouse is traveling in. My handbook gives me an example to rotate the image through 180deg with keypresses, which work, but then packman is just upside down, with his eye at the bottom.p  pIs there another way of flipping packman depending on mouse direction I only need horizontal flip, i.e. left and rightp

Negative 2548 pI work on a small team developing a product that deals with a lot of expensive data. Because of the cost associated with this data, it is not possible to fully test code locally.

Likewise, we have a branch that matches production were using master, and a branch that matches staging called staging.p  pIve done a good bit of searching on the topic of git workflows, but they all seem to assume that the team churns away on some development branch maybe directly, or maybe using feature branches that are merged in. And when everything in that branch is good to go, its merged into the production branch maybe through a release branch first and the process repeats.

We cannot wait for everything in the staging branch to be completely done, tested, and working before we release stuff to production.p  pSo whats the best way to handle this So far, Ive experimented withp  ol liFeature branches based on the staging branch that can be merged into staging and then cherrypicked to master when ready.li liFeature branches that are merged into staging for testing, and merged into master when ready.

I login to the application, everything is perfect with feeds. Now if I close my browser without logging out and navigate to my site again. It redirects me to the homepage because of a cookie.

This obvious wont work since I am going to have lots of strongly typed views floating around, and this loginlogout markup needs to be on every page. What design solution would work for the requirements I have Include the LoginModel.cs in emeveryem ViewModel I create Not sure I would like to go that route. Another option I saw was having a BaseViewModel that have the LoginModel in it, which helps keep the DRY principle, but I feel may violate KISS. Any ideasp

Negative 2548 pI have a csv file that is 3,642,197 lines long and i need it to be sorted from earliest date to latest date.  p  pI wrote a program that searches the database, and writes every line that contains the API number the user specifies to a file that will be used for graphing later.  Its very important that it has the earliest dates occur first in the file, so Im running into this problem  Whoever put this giant file together used 3 different files from excel and combined it into one csv, so the dates arent sorted.  p  pIf i can format the database so that all the earliest dates would be found first, i figure that would be the easiest way to solve the problem.p  pI am somewhat new to python and Im trying to wrap my head around how i can sort this file by date.  I tried to do it in excel and libreoffice calc, but it exceeds the maximum row allowance.p  pHere is an example of the text in the filep  p01311986,25003050040000,SHA,Shannon,121,,0,0,1324,31,False,P,p  pI have records from 2013 to 1986, and have to have them sorted, but have not been able to understand how this is done.  From what i have searched i cannot find anything that I can understand.p  pMuch thanks and appreciation in advance  p  pEDIT  the easiest way is with Linuxunix.  A simple sort command does exactly what Im talking about.  p  pEx. Sort t g r k3 k1 k2 infile.csv   outfile.csvp  pt sets the delimiter, g sort by numerical value, r reads the file in starting at the last line. k3 is the year field, k1 is the month field, and k2 is the day field.  It will sort by year, then by month, then by day.  If you need to sort a giant csv file chronologically, and it wont fit into excel, this is by far the easiest solution I have found.p  pNote  if your data is comma separated and the field after your date field is a number, you will need to change the first comma delimiter to a  so it doesnt include the trailing data in the sort.p  pEx.  02251987,204928169562,62563959401,16375840 lt this will need to be changed to 02251987204928169562,62563959401,16375840 so your data is sorted correctly.p

Negative 2548 pIm using Flashdevelop to write this in AS3p  pIm making a Pikmininspired 2D platformer, so naturally, I have very large amounts of Sprites on screen at once.

What youre seeing The grey ball is a stack of 22 sprites. The blue background is a sprite. The shepherdlooking guy is a sprite. The left is a total of 23 sprites, and right at the shepherd is a total of 24. As you can see, the blue in that overlap which is the bottom layer isnt drawing, despite the alpha of all the pixels above it being zero.p  pIs this just a thing with Flash that I have to put up with, or am I doing something wrongp  pEdit a hrefhttppastebin.comkM3m0Ts0 relnofollowHeres my codea Sorry I dont have enough rep to post it as multiple links. Knock yourself out.p  pSecond Edit I nixed all of my code, and just added a lot of plain Sprites, and the problem still happened at exactly 23 Sprites. My suspicions are confirmed in thinking that Flash cant handle that many overlapping Sprites. Im going to play around with it and try to find a workaround.p
Negative 2548 pIn our company we are using a camera that has a RGB connection and we use a USB digitizer to connect it to the computer. What are various means to detect that the camera is disconnectedp  pCurrently we know that if the USB device digitizer is disconnected, we get a device disconnected notification hooking onto windows events. The problem is when we remove the RGB connection, we are finding it to detect the disconnection means. So we are doing some frame analysis like if all the pixels have the same RGB value, that means its a black image and that means something wrong.p  pSince camera is a integral solution medical device, detecting camera disconnect is related to patient safety. Is there a better way to find.p  pWould really appreciate your input.p

Negative 2548 pI want to extend an existing PHP tool which provides automatic CRUD forms for a Database. I want to introduce the possibility to add completely custom php pages sort of feature extensions. I want to keep the solution as easy as possible, I was thinking about implementing the feature in the following wayp  ul lithe userdeveloper adds a new page from an admin menu, specifying the PHP source file name e.g. myfileli lithe system automatically adds a menu item link for this new pageli lithe system, when a custom php page link is clicked, just loads the file something like requires .customfiles.myfile..phpli ul  pWhat security issues can you see in this approach The first issue to handle is the fact that the userdeveloper could use variable names which are used by the system itself, and this can of course lead to problems. In order to handle this aspect, I was thinking about forcing the userdeveloper to use specific variable names once you have chosen a prefix, e.g. customvars, the user can just modify variables starting with that prefix, e.g. customvarsa, customvarstest, POST[customvarstest2] and so on. In this way I will be sure to avoid conflict.p  pIs there any way to avoid the modification of variables whose names dont start with the specified stringp  pI know the solution is a bit hacky and not very elegant but I need an implementation very quickly.p

Negative 2548 pIm trying to make a basic Paintesque app for a class, and part of what Im trying to implement is the ability to draw a circle that scales in size as the user moves their finger to pick the center, and drags it outward to the desired radius. The problem is, no matter what I try it just ends up repeatedly stamping a small circle where ever the user moves their finger. The idea is the app will get the coordinates for the center tX, tY on the press down, draw a circle with a radius r every time the user moves, then finalize it when they lift their finger.p  pEdit the commented out sections are parts where I was testing different things.p  pCode for my onMotionEvent custom classp  precodeOverride public boolean onTouchEventMotionEvent event      detect user touch          float tX  event.getX     float tY  event.getY     float rX  0     float rY  0      switch event.getAction      case MotionEvent.ACTIONDOWN         drawPath.moveTotX, tY         break     case MotionEvent.ACTIONMOVE         ifshapes             rX  int event.getX             rY  int event.getY              r   float Math.sqrtMath.powtX  rX, 2  Math.powtY  rY, 2              drawCanvas.drawCircletX, tY, r, drawPaint              invalidate         else             drawPath.lineTotX, tY                   break     case MotionEvent.ACTIONUP         rX  event.getX         rY  event.getY          r   float Math.sqrtMath.powtX  rX, 2  Math.powtY  rY, 2          ifshapes             ifshapesel  0                 drawCanvas.drawCircletX, tY, r, drawPaint                 drawPath.reset             else ifshapesel  1                           else                       else             drawCanvas.drawPathdrawPath, drawPaint             drawPath.reset                   break     default         return false           invalidate     return true  codepre

Negative 2548 pIm currently working on a C project that requires me to send variables from on file to another through a socket connection on the same machine  through localhost. Therefore, in order to send variables from file A to file B, I put such variables in a buffer defined as a char 1D array and send the whole buffer with the different variables contained in it. To do so, I use sprintfbuffer, fn fn, variable1, variable2 to put the variables from File A. For File B to read the buffer, and associate the variables in the buffer to variables of its own, I do sscanfbuffer, fn fn, ampvariable1, ampvariable2 where variable1 and variable2 would have been defined in File B.p  pHowever, Im wondering if its possible to put variables in the buffer in File A through different instances in the program. If so, everytime a new variable is put in the buffer, will File B be able to access the variables in the same order theyre put in file A For example, if variable1 and variabe2 are put in the buffer in point A, and then varibale 3 is put in the buffer in point B, will File B be able to access those variables in that orderp  pFinally, if a variable of the same name is put in the buffer in two different locations, will the second time overwrite the first I.e, if variable1 is put in the buffer in point x and then again in point y, will the second time the variable is put in point y overwrite the time it was put in point xp  pIm not sure if my question was clear enough but I hope it was and I appreciate any help  p

Negative 2548 pIs it possible to use Grails to provide Controllers and Views, Neo4j as the database and self written domain classes that wrap the database access and CRUD operations without the neo4j pluginp  pThe data I have 106 Nodes, 107 Relationships are very well suited to be modeled by a graph DB. The Nodes and the relationships both need to have labels and properties so they can be accessed through traversal methods that only go via certain paths in the graph. I want to use grails for the web interface because I just starting learning programming a few weeks ago and it appears to be a pretty good point to begin.p  pFrom what I understand until know is that with the Grails Neo4jplugin, it is not possible to set relationships with properties and labels. It seems very appealing and easy to write the classes that relate to the data using the plain Neo4jJavaAPI.p  pAdditionally, if my database is already structured in a way that directly relates to Objects, what is the benefit of using ORM or objectgraphmapping in this casep

Negative 2548 pIm new to TypeScript and trying to use it with AngularJS. Heres a situation thats bothering me because I cant get an error from the compiler.p  pIn Angular AFAIK, a resource provider has a codegetcode method that returns an instance of codeTcode, codeTcode being a type parameter. This method has many other overloads, and can accept codeparamscode or codedatacode parameters, and possibly a success and an error handler with signatures like thisp  precodeinterface IResourceSuccessCallbackFunctionltTgt      value T, responseHeaders Arrayltstringgt void   interface IResourceErrorCallbackFunction      httpResponse string void  codepre  pI took inspiration from the stronga hrefhttpsgithub.comborisyankovDefinitelyTypedblobmasterangularjsangularresource.d.ts relnofollowcorresponding declaration file at DefinitelyTypedastrong to come up with these overloads for the codegetcode functionp  precodeinterface IResourceClassltTgt      get T     getdataOrParams any T     getdataOrParams any, success IResourceSuccessCallbackFunctionltTgt T     getsuccess IResourceSuccessCallbackFunctionltTgt, error IResourceErrorCallbackFunction T     getparams any, data any, success IResourceSuccessCallbackFunctionltTgt, error IResourceErrorCallbackFunction T  codepre  pMy problem is that those definitions allow me to write stuff like thisp  precodevar resourceService IResourceClassltnumbergt  null var res1  resourceService.get id 1000 , function      console.logfail  var res2  resourceService.getfunctionp Phone      console.logp , function      console.logfail  codepre  pObviously, here, for coderes1code, the programmer made a mistake by passing an error handler as second argument, forgetting about the success handler and for coderes2code, the supposed success handler is accepting the wrong type codePhonecode instead of codenumbercode.p  pNow, I know why those two calls compile and are valid the last overloaded version is always a match, because it allows two codeanycode params and two optional params, which are here absent. So Im looking for a way to define the overloaded variants that would catch those errors. For instance, replace codeanycode with a type that would say not a function, or though some other trick.p  pIs this possiblep
Negative 2548 pI am trying to find an efficient way using polymorphism to copy specific attributes between two derived classes externally. I have a set of data classes that derive from a base class codeDataClassAcode. I want to operate on these data classes in a separate filter class that takes codeDataClassAcode references as input and output parameters. The filter will perform the necessary operations common to codeDataClassAcode, but I also want to propagate classspecific attributes from my input to output class. Considerp  precodeclass DataClassA  public     virtual void copyAttributes DataClassAamp copyFrom    class DataClassB  public DataClassA  public     virtual void copyAttributes DataClassAamp copyFrom    class DataFilter      void run DataClassAamp input, DataClassBamp output               do some calculations here            ...         then copy over attributes         output.copyAttributes input        codepre  pMy problem is obviously that the codecopyAttributescode depends on needing to know the types of both the input and output derived classes which need not necessarily be the same. However, the filter will only handle references to the base class codeDataClassAcode. My reflex is to simply institute a codedynamiccastcode, though I risk getting my hand slapped and other possible negative consequences. If I did this, I would simply create a codecopyAttributescode method for each derived class that called the codecopyAttributescode of the parent class, and then use codedynamiccastcode to see if the codecopyFromcode object is of the same typep  precodevoid DataClassBcopyAttributes DataClassAamp copyFrom       copy attributes from parent class       DataClassAcopyAttributes copyFrom       test if the class being copied from is of type DataClassB     DataClassB copyPtr  dynamiccastltDataClassBgtampcopyFrom     if copyPtr  NULL               copy DataClassBspecific attributes from copyFrom to this         ...       codepre  pThe most similar post I could find on the problem was here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2440285virtualfunctionsandpolymorphismVirtual functions and polymorphisma. My primary questions are 1 is my proposed use of dynamiccast inappropriate and 2 if so, how might I implement this codecopyAttributescode another way There were references to using a visitor design pattern though Im not sure how that would look. p  pThis is kind of a simpler version of what the Visualization Toolkit VTK does in the sense that Im using classes of filters that operate on a number of different data classes. Interestingly, they handle RTTI by including macros that include the string name of classes and parent classes that can be compared directly for correct downcasting of datatypes.p

Negative 2548 pI am currently trying to implement a function to sort a XML file by the attribute of one of its nodes.p  pThe way to go seemed to be using XSLT to transform the XML file and by researching a bit I managed to put together a working XSLT file validated in some onlinevalidator, output was as would be expected.p  pAfter I got the results I wanted, I started implementing JavaScript functions to do this automatically every time it is required. Ultimately a chart amCharts will be created using the data from the XML file. To generate that chart properly, the data has to be sorted though.p  pRight now everything seems to work syntaxwise, however, the XSLTProcessor andor XMLSerializer seem to have problems parsingcombining both the XML and XLST file.p  pStrangely enough Firefox also throws an error strongComponent returned failure code 0x80600001 [nsIXSLTProcessor.importStylesheet]strongp  pChrome doesnt seem to have this problem. p  pBut this is not the main issue. The result generated contains a rudimental HTML page saying that there was an error, but giving no exact error descriptionlocationexplanation whatsoever.p  pI expected to see the sorted XML file here, just as in the online XMLXSLT validator, which had the same inputs XMLXSLT content wise.p  pDoes anyone have an idea regarding the source of this issue Would greatly appreciate any hints andor solutions to this.p  pbest regards,p  pdaZzap  pstrongEditstrongp  pAfter researching the Extra content at the end of the document error on the generated page more indepth and having overlooked it when I posted the OP, it seems that the error is triggered when there are more than one root elements in the XML file, which would obviously be wrong.p  pHowever, the source XML files do not have multiple root nodes and are all perfectly valid.p  pThis leads me to believe that the XSLT reorderingsorting of the source file is not done as expected, although it looked good in the XSLT validator. I guess somehow it produces multiple root nodes instead of just reordering the item nodes within the root nodep  pUnfortunately I am no expert regarding XSLT so it would be awesome, if someone with a more detailed knowledge could especially look at the XSLT code.p  pstrongEdit2strongp  pI think I might have solved the problem by changing the XSLT query slightly.

Negative 2548 pI have a working system that has a cshtml page where you can add new items. These items are related to a tree of items, and if I dont set a specific item to add on, it would add directly to the root. It is kinda hard to explain, but the main thing is that whenever I add an item directly to the rootnot being specific, it works fine. However, whenever I click on a specific item and add a new item to be its child, the proccess works fine and the item is added, but after that the whole page doesnt work. At all. All the fields, buttons, anything. The only way to solve is to refresh the page.p  pThe page is made in cshtml with jquery.p  pI wanted to know if any of you have ever been in to a situation like this and if you did, howd you manage to solve the problem.p  pThanksp

Negative 2548 pIm developing a hardware abstraction library for an embedded product using GCC C. Within the library there is a variable that should be readonly to the application that links the library, but can be modified from within the compilation unit that defines it.p  pIs there a standard, acceptable way to declare the integer in the library header file that will allow the application to read the value in the variable, but tell the compiler to generate an error if any attempt is made to generate code that writes back to it For example, if I were to declare a emfunctionem asp  precodeextern void fooint const bar codepre  p... then the caller is permitted to pass a local variablep  precodeint bar  0 foobar codepre  p... but if the function declaration attempts to write to codebarcodep  precodevoid fooint const bar      bar  99  codepre  p... then the compiler duely reports an error assignment of readonly location bar.p  pThe syntax of placing the codeconstcode before the name does not appear to apply to variables in the same way that it does to function parameters, and the two lines below seem to be effectively equivalentp  precodeextern const int x extern int const y codepre  p... because defining y as codeint ycode results in an error conflicting type qualifiers for y, as I would expect to have seen had x been defined as codeint xcode.p  pI know that I can get around the problem by declaring and defining an accessor function that returns the value which can only be used as an rvalue.p  pIve read a number of related questions here, but none that Ive found provide a definitive answer for C as opposed to C or Cp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8051969caccessinganonconstthroughconstdeclarationC  Accessing a nonconst through const declarationap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2190919mixingexternandconstMixing extern and constap  pPlease can someone point in me the direction of an example of how I might achieve it, or confirm my suspicion that it is not syntactically achievablep

Negative 2548 pI know how to solve this problem in an usual way, not using dynamic programming.  If you could be kind enough to explain to me the solutiongive me a general idea pseudocode. Thanks a bunch.p  pThe input consists of a sequence R  hR0, . . . ,Rni of nonnegative integers, and an integer k. The number Ri represents the number of users requesting some particular piece of information at time i say from a www server.p  pIf the server broadcasts this information at some time t, the the requests of all the users who requested the information strictly before time t are satisfied. The server can broadcast this information at most k times. The goal is to pick the k times to broadcast in order to minimize the total time over all requests that requestsusers have to wait in order to have their requests satisfied.p  pAs an example, assume that the input was R  3, 4, 0, 5, 2, 7 so n  6 and k  3. Then one possible solution there is no claim that this is the optimal solution would be to broadcast at times 2, 4, and 7 note that it is obvious that in every optimal schedule that there is a broadcast at time n  1 if Rn 6 0. The 3 requests at time 1 would then have to wait 1 time unit. The 4 requests at time 2 would then have to wait 2 time units. The 5 requests at time 4 would then have to wait 3 time units. The 2 requests at time 5 would then have to wait 2 time units. The 7 requests at time 6 would then have to wait 1 time units. Thus the total waiting time for this solution would be 3  1  4  2  5  3  2  2  7  1. .p  pIO description. Input n and k, separated by one space on the first line, then R on second line. Output the sequence of the k times.p
Negative 2548 pI have built a c library that does lots of low level read only IO, i.e. fsetpos, fread etc. This library is used by all implemenations of our app, i.e. iOS, android etc. We want to build a version of our app for Firefox OS, and found that you cant use native code in your apps there. I decided to use emscripten to work around this, and managed to interact with the library just fine, except that it couldnt find any files in firefox os. It expects to be handed a path to a directory with files in it.p  pIs this even possible I need to be able to access the files directly from c, and they are too large to hold in memory. I will always use just a small part of each file, and need to be able to jump around in the files fast. I havent found any documentation for firefox apis that will work for me. The emscripten documentation suggests that NODEFS is the only way to do it, by mounting a data directory in NODEFS, but it doesnt look like it will work on firefox os. Another option would be to preload the data with the emscripten build, but the files are too large for that.p  pHope someone can help.p

Negative 2548 pI am using Hibernate 4.2, JPA 2.0 amp Postgres 9.2 p  pThe code gets stuck at codePersistence.createEntityManagerFactoryperistenceunitnamecodep  pOn further investigation I found that Hibernate makes a call to codegetTypeInfocode method of codejava.sql.DatabaseMetaDatacode class.

Negative 2548 pI am trying to implement a genetic algorithm for my Masters Thesis relating to satellite constellation design.  I want to obtain paretofronts for multiple objective functions.  I am writing my own algorithm based on a NonDominated Rank based Sorting Genetic Algorithm by Ashish Ghosh and Mrinal Kanti Das  a hrefhttpwww.isical.ac.inashMrinalfi08.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.isical.ac.inashMrinalfi08.pdfa  which is based on the NSGAII.  This algorithm uses elitism by combining the parent and child populations into a single set of individuals, size 2N, and then selecting the N best individuals to become the new child population, where N is the size of the initial population.  The fitness is based on nondominated fronts, the ranking within each front, and the spacing between individuals in that front. p  pThe algorithm I wrote works fine until nearly every individual in the combined parentchild population is in the first nondominated front they are all nondominated.  When this occurs, the only thing that distinguishes fitness between every individual is the spacing between individuals.  Therefore, I could have an individual that performs very well and should be passed on to the next generation, but it does not get selected for because it may be close to another individual.  If I take a plot of every solution over the entire GA run, there are some solutions in the first nondominated front at the end of the GA that are dominated by previous individuals that did not get passed on to the next generation.  This could be a problem with my code, but after thinking about the way the algorithm works, I am wondering if it is a problem with the algorithm.  p  pThanks for your helpp  pHere is my Pseudo Codep  ol lipInitialize random population of size N.pli lipCompute the fitness, f, of each individual for each objective function.pli lipClassify each individual into nondominated fronts nondominated solutions go into first front, then discard solutions in first front and the next set of nondominated solutions go into second front, until entire population is sorted into sets of nondominated fronts.pli lipAssign ranks to each solution, where the rank of solution i is the number of solutions that dominate solution i.pli lipCalculate the minimum distance between solution i and the next closest solution in the same front as solution i, for all i.pli lipCompute the new fitness value, F, based on front, rank, and minimum distancep  pThe average fitness value Favg is assigned to the first front where Favgi  N for all solutions i in front 1 and N  number of individuals in populationp  pThe average fitness for each individual in current front is then adjusted based on rank where, Fadji  Favgi  gi for all solutions i in current front, and where gi is the number of solutions in the same front as solution I having rank less than or equal to that of solution ip  pThe density factor is then considered where Fi  Fadji  1Min, where Min is the minimum distance between solution I and the next closest solution in the same front as solution i, and Fi is the final fitness value of solution ip  pIf Fj is the minimum fitness of solution j and Fj lt 0 then add 0  Fj to the fitness of all solutions to make them positivep  pThe Favg value is assigned for the next front, Favgii  Favgi  e, where e is some small value thereby ensuring the fitness values of front f is less than that of any solution of front f1pli lipNext perform the genetic operations tournament based selection, crossover, and mutation to obtain a child population of size N.pli lipCompute the fitness, f, of each individual in the child population for each objective function.pli lipCombine the parent population and child population into a single set of size 2N.pli lipNext repeat steps 36 to classify and compute the fitness F of the combined parentchild population.pli lipPerform elitism by sorting the fitness values, F, of the combined population.

Negative 2548 pI am using the bundled JMS implementation on Wildfly 8.1 HornetQ to OCR a large number of documents.p  pI want to have a pool of 3 MDBs consuming the messages of a Queue with the documents to be OCRed. Each MDB starts a process with the a hrefhttpcommons.apache.orgpropercommonsexec relnofollowApache commonsexeca and blocks until that process exits. p  pIn my test I have 50 JMS messages each represents a document to be OCRed which are loaded on the Queue at the beginning of the test. When the processing starts, at any given time I can see that there are 3 CPU intensive OCR processes, one started and blocked upon by each MDB. At some point, after 20 minutes or so, one of the OCR processes dissappears, and only 2 remain alive at any given time. When there are 10 JMS messages or so remaining, another OCR process stops, and there is only 1 at any given time.p  pIn the end, all 50 documents have been OCRed, and no exception is being thrown by any of the OCR processes or my application. p  pI find this behaviour strange because I would expect that there would be 3 OCR processes alive at any point in time consuming JMS messages except at the end of course. This behaviour could be explained if the JMS messages are assigned to the MDB instances upon entry in the Queue, and not real time. For instance, if each MDB was assigned around 17 messages. Depending on the document sizes, some MDB instances could finish earlier and stay idle without consuming any other messages, when the other MDB instances could still have messages to consume.p  pIs this what is happening If yes, is there a way to change this so that the assignment of messages to MDB instances happens whenever an MDB instance finishes processing a messagep  precodeMessageDrivenactivationConfig           ActivationConfigPropertypropertyName  destinationLookup, propertyValue  queuecsrOcrQueue,         ActivationConfigPropertypropertyName  minSession, propertyValue  3,         ActivationConfigPropertypropertyName  maxSession, propertyValue  3  TransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.NOTSUPPORTED public class OcrMessageListener implements MessageListener  codepre

Negative 2548 pI have 2 different strings codeXXcode and codeXXEcode.

You can create a table and you can select the collation for the table.

I have a text file with some strings in it UTF8. I want to display the values on screen sorted  where the collation is again, relatively important and I want to let the user search for values. The collation used for search will be an option. p

After doing some research on this, I found that this can happen if you supply arbitrary initial centroids, but in this case the initial centroids are taken from the datapoints themselves, so this doesnt really make sense. Ive tried reassigning these centroids to random datapoints, but that causes the code to not converge or at least after letting it run all night, the code never converged. Basically they get reassigned, but that causes other centroids to get marginalized, and repeat. Im not really sure whats wrong with my code, but I ran this same dataset through Rs kmeans function for k100 for 1000 iterations and it managed to converge. Does anyone know what Im messing up here Thank you.p

Negative 2548 pI am developing an asp.net application which needs to search a record from around 5 million recordsof around 4GB data. Client is looking for higher performance and decided to memory cache. But I m facing issue while  uploading data into memory cache from asp.net. I tried changing application pool settings and made virtual memory as 0, private memory as 0.. Nothing worked out. It is uploading fine till around 1.5GB and throwing  out of memory exceptions. There is no issue when I  pushed data using console application by unchecking  32 bit in  build settings in application properties.  My Issue with asp.net.  I am using .net frame work 4.0 with 4 core server , the memory available in the server is around 49GB.   I also tried with enabling  32 bit run on 64 mode in application pool. But nothing changed.  Could   please suggest me if there is any solution.p

Negative 2548 pSo I have to make a program where I calculate the sum of some elements in an array and then find the number of digits of the sum e.g. if the sum of several elements is 175, I have to print the value of the sum 175 and the number of digits of 175 3. p  pTo determine the number of digits I use the following while loopp  precodewhile sum gt 0      sum  10     digits  codepre  pAs you might have noticed, at the end of the loop the sum is 0. So I thought of creating an alias of sump  precodeintamp rSum  sum codepre  pSo I simply substituted sum with rSum in the array, in order to find the numbers of digits, and printed sum in the end of the program. Anyways, the value of sum after the loop is 0, in other words equal to rSum. So I guess, when you create an alias to a certain variable, modifying the alias, modifies the variable itself, which is a problem in my case. p  pMy question is, can I create the program with aliases or using references, pointers etc., or is the only way by creating a copy of the sum variable codeint rSum  sumcodep

Im asked to do it for associativities of 2,4,8, and 16, but Im just focusing on 2 ways at the moment. p  pThe prefetch is supposed to bring in the next memory line into the cache with every cache access. For example, if current access is to index 213, then you also bring the data to index 214, replacing that indexs previous content. The cache hits and misses will not be updated on the prefetches and the cache replacement policy is least recently used.p  pMy implementation of prefetch gives me 996580 cache hits, as opposed to the correct answer of 996682.

Negative 2548 pAs you know, windows messages are either queued or non queued, based on how they are dispatched.

The following is a chronology of events leading up to the proxy solicitation related to the 2013 Annual Meeting     On November 30, 2012, a telephone conference was held among Sardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Holdings Inc. and Biglari Capital Sandra B. Cochran, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and James W. Bradford, Chairman of the Board of the Company. Ms. Cochran and Mr. Bradford conveyed to Mr. Biglari the Companys interest in exploring a buyback of all of the Shares owned by Biglari and its affiliates.Mr. Biglari subsequently replied that Biglari was not interested in a share repurchase not offered to all other Cracker Barrel shareholders.     On February 13, 2013, during a telephone conference among Mr. Biglari, Ms. Cochran and Mr. Bradford, the Cracker Barrel representatives reiterated the Companys willingness to explore a repurchase of all of the Shares owned by Biglari and its affiliates.Mr. Biglari restated his position on this matter and urged the Company instead either to tender for 20 of the outstanding Shares or to issue a onetime special dividend to all shareholders.Later that same day, Biglari received a written offer from the Company, authorized by the Board, for the buyback of all of the 4,737,794 Shares then owned by Biglari and its affiliates at market price subject to any adjustments that may be required by applicable Tennessee law.     On February 14, 2013, Mr. Biglari sent a letter to the Cracker Barrel Board stating that he was not interested in a share repurchase that is not offered to all other Cracker Barrel shareholders.The letter continued that, since Cracker Barrel has the capability of purchasing Biglaris nearly 20 stake, then worth over 300 million, Mr. Biglari had two recommendations to the Board 1 tender for 20 of the Companys outstanding Shares or 2 issue a onetime special dividend of 300 million. Mr. Biglari contended that shareholders deserve a rational capital allocation strategy, one that benefits everyone proportionally.Mr. Biglari stated that it was his desire to see management succeed because of his investment in the Company. Mr. Biglari concluded that he and Dr. Cooley remained ready to offer their services to work with the Board productively and to discuss ways to augment shareholder value.     On March 6, 2013, Mr. Biglari and Philip L. Cooley, Vice Chairman of the Board of Biglari Holdings Inc., held a telephone conference with Mr. Bradford and Ms. Cochran in which Mr. Biglari proposed that Cracker Barrel pay a onetime special dividend of 15.00 per Share to all shareholders of the Company. Mr. Biglari provided the rationale for the Boards adjusting the capital structure to return a substantial amount of cash to Cracker Barrels shareholders.     On March 25, 2013, Mr. Biglari received a voice message from Mr. Bradford in which Mr. Bradford specified he would place before the Board Mr. Biglaris 15.00 per Share special dividend proposal.     On May 16, 2013, Messrs. Biglari and Cooley held a telephone conference with Mr. Bradford and Ms. Cochran.Mr. Biglari inquired about the status of the Boards review of the proposed special dividend. Mr. Bradford replied that the Board had not met to discuss the matter. Mr. Biglari urged the Company to reach a swift resolution of this matter for the benefit of all shareholders. Mr. Biglari asserted that in the absence of a decision on the special dividend, he would use all means to advance the concept of a special dividendp

Negative 2548 pMy typical workflow is to create a new branch, and occasionally merge in changes from master. Lets say I add a total of 100 lines of code to my branch. Lets say there are 1,000 lines of code changed on master. When I go to create a new pull request, I end up seeing 1,100 lines of code. It seems that GitHub is incorrectly diffing master from my branch.p  pWhen I do the pull request, I select the base branch as master, and the comparison branch as my branch. Shouldnt GitHub make the comparison such that the pull request only shows 100 lines of codep  pIn other words, why is GitHub showing masters LoC additionssubtractions with my branchs additionssubtractions In the past, Ive created clean branches when Im done to fix this. That involves diffing the branch from master, creating a patchfile, creating a new branch from master which becomes the clean one, and then applying that patch to the clean branch. Once Ive done that, the diff cleanly shows only my code additionssubtractions. This happens on both iOS and Rails repos, where Im using XCode and Sublime 3 respectively.p

In what kind of way would this be possible p  pId like to use something like Rivest Cipher, or is there anything better I could use and in which wayp  pPS. Im not a crypto expert so sorry if this is a noob question. I just want somebody to clear things out from me because I cant find anything specific to what I want. Maybe Im just not searching good enough.p  pPPS. I dont know how to start off. I cant try it out since I dont know how I would do it.p

The second call depends on data from the first one, so it is important that the first one finishes executing before the second one starts. However, in the following code snippet, the second function always starts before the first one finishes, therefore it never gets the data.

Negative 2548 pSo I written some code that runs on page load, the objective of the code is to grab all items from a specific drop down menu, store those items in an array and then one by one add those items from the array back into the drop down menu in a customized order.p  pHere is my problem, on this specific page there are 7 drop down menus, on page load it is doing exactly what it should be doing, it is customizing the order perfectly. Based on the selection the user makes, it filter another drop down. The problem is that I am grabbing the drop down object based on a codehasoptioncontainscode, this is the problem because the drop down menu being filtered is using the keyword I am grabbing to grab that object. p  pFor examplep  pMy drop down menu contains p  pNew Yorkp  pAlabamap  pTexasp  pstrongUser chooses New Yorkstrongp  pThe drop down being filtered would then be filtered top  pNew York  Shoppingp  pNew York  Nightlifep  pNew York  Sportsp  pThe problem is since I am using the codehasoptioncontainscode and using codeNew Yorkcode, on submit both drop downs are being refiltered and causing an issue...p  pHere is my codep  precode        var select  selecthasoptioncontainsNew York         var options  select.findoption          assigning drop down list items to new variable         var OptionObj1  select optioncontainsNone         var OptionObj2  select optioncontainsNew York         var OptionObj3  select optioncontainsTexas         var OptionObj4  select optioncontainsAlabama         var OptionObj5  select optioncontainsColorado          clearing drop down list         select.empty          adding new items from array into drop down list         select.appendOptionObj1 [0]         select.appendOptionObj2 [0]         select.appendOptionObj3 [0]         select.appendOptionObj4 [0]         select.appendOptionObj5 [0]   codepre  pI said alot in the here and some might not make sense, so please let me know if anything needs to be clarified.p  pI believe the problem is codevar select  selecthasoptioncontainsNew Yorkcode...

Negative 2548 pThanks in advance for looking. p  pstrongThe goalstrongp  pIn short Update django user object and custom user profile object only if there is a change from a single view.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pFor starters, this is my first time trying to do anything like this, so it may be something really simple and I am just overlooking it. p  pIt seems to be failing on validation steps and I am getting an HTTP 400 error saying username must be unique, even when I am not sending a change that would be changing the current users username. Now I could probably use the view that is built into djangorestauth to update just the user portion, then create just a custom view that only updates the profile. But that seems hacky and silly, but if it is the way to go then I will do it.p  pstrongThings I have triedstrongp  ul liTried both puts and patches.

Negative 2548 pI wrote an console application that extracts data from my access table then using sql bulk copy to an temp sql table then from the temp table loads it into main sql table. the application works as expected but it extracts 26624 rows from access table and when it does a WriteToServer on Bulk copy it only copies 24880 rows and hence when inserted into the main sql table only 24880 rows get inserted. about 1744 rows are missing but i do get an exception p  blockquote   pSqlDateTime overflow.

Negative 2548 pAlthough I already read similar comments here, in this forum, I havent found an approach that may be suitable for teamwork in a seamless way.p  pIf you know what I mean, you already may found tricky working with git and the codeproject.pbxprojcode file in Xcode, even when you are working in a different file.p  pSay,p  ul liA developer created Foo folder, adding foo.swift to the project.li liB developer created Bar folder, adding bar.swift to the project.li ul  pDifferent paths... but you know, conflict And as you may also noticed, leaving codeproject.pbxprojcode out is not an option.p  pSo my question is How do you handle this in a professional manner, Git flow ready and easiest way.p  pThank you all very much.p  pPS Im using currently Bitbucket and SourceTree if matters.p  pPS2 Id like to avoid command line and manually file editing if possible.p

Negative 2548 pAm trying to implement cloudkit sync with local core data stack, I had a few doubts as follows p  ol lipI needed a table to have unique field other then the CKRecordID field. So how can i achieve this   The manual process of checking before inserting in cloudkit is too cumbersome. pli lipPrevent deletion of a parent record if a child record exist in cloud kit.  Explanation Say i have two devices both are synced with cloud with a single child for a parent record, now Device 1 inserts a child record for that parent and syncs with cloud kit and device 2 deletes that particular parent, now when device 2 syncs with cloud it automatically deletes the parent and the new inserted child with it. What i want to achieve is if a new child exist on a parent in cloud then the parent record must not get deleted instead when device 2 syncs, it gets the parent along with new child record. pli ol  pNote Using Private database with custom zone.p  pAny suggestions are most welcome. Thanks in advancep

Use conditional statements instead. If a control can be done with ifelse statement clearly, dont use exceptions because it reduces readability and performance  e.g. null control, divide by zero control.p  pSo is better to use ifelse statment Or how do you do Or is better only working with trycatch statmentp  pAnd later when I have more ifelse code statments one in other .. is better to use basic error bool and error string for all over the code When happend just turning this bool to true state and write message to error string And later by showing result check if any error happendp  pIf you dont understand the question please ask, or write how do you handle with errors in code for userp  pAny general guide will be welcome p

Is there a way to do this  Should the models just be designed differentlyp  hr  pAt the suggestion of rofls, these are the real model names, and the intended usagep  precodeclass Authorizationmodels.Model     active  models.BooleanField     userroot  models.IntegerField     name  models.TextFieldmaxlength64  class Valuemodels.Model     entryid  models.AutoFieldprimarykeyTrue     active  models.BooleanField     id  models.IntegerField     parent  models.IntegerField     name  models.TextFieldmaxlength64     value  models.TextFieldmaxlength2048 codepre  pThe intent is to for the Values table to store values in a hierarchical manner.  The hierarchy is maintained using parent  id.  So, for examplep  precode name                value                       gt folder1             gt value         some value codepre  pwould look like this in the Values tablep  precode entryid  active  id  parent  name     value         0    True   1       1                   1    True   2       1  folder1           2    True   3       2   value1  some value codepre  pNote here that id is different from entryid, and that it allows for history.  For example, changing the value of codeid3code, is a matter of making active False for codeentryid2code, and entering a new value with codeactiveTrue, id3, parent2code.  DBdesign wise, its pretty rudimentary stuff.p  pWhere it gets Django complicated especially for someone like me who is just getting started trying to wrap his head around the ORM, is that since User roles are a kind of value, I figured they belonged in the bit of the application that stores values.  So, codeAuthorization.userrootcode points to an id which is parent to all of the relevant settings.p  pSorry for the wall of text.  Heres the actual problem Im trying to solve Given a user authorization name, how do I know which users have it  If this were SQL, the query would look like thisp  precode SELECT a.name, v.value  FROM Authorization a   JOIN Value v ON a.userroot  v.parent and v.active  1  WHERE v.name  some name and v.active  1 codepre

Negative 2548 pI want to construct a query with a multiplication like thisp  precodeSELECT  Jobs.id AS Jobsid,  UNIXTIMESTAMPNOW  UNIXTIMESTAMPJobs.datelastdone  Jobs.share AS priority  FROM jobs Jobs  ORDER BY priority DESC codepre  pVirtual fields dont seem to work in this situation, because it is impossible to use ORDER BY with virtual fields. p  pAny help much appreciatedp  pI found one possible solution, but it is bit hacky. In a custom finder model of my JobsTable I wrote thisp  precodepublic function findWithPriorityQuery query, array options      querygtselect[         id,          priority gt querygtfuncgtround[UNIXTIMESTAMPNOW  UNIXTIMESTAMPJobs.datelastdone   Jobs.share gt literal],     ]     gtorder[priority gt DESC]     return query  codepre  pI just put my multiplication in a roundfunction, which lets me execute literal statements. However the roundfunction in and of itself is just superfluous for my purposes, so I think there got to be a better solutionp
