Positive 299 pI have been given a list of websites that need to be checked for any flash content. This could be flash video, flash ads, sIFR, FLV, FLA. Ive been tasked with identifying whether flash content is being used on each site, and if so where. The list is a mixture of live and local sites.p  pI could do this manually, by going through every page on each site, but Im sure there is a much more effective, timesaving and thorough way of doing this.p  pMy first thought was to use a spider like Screaming Frog SEO spider, although Ive not used it before. It has been mentioned this could flag areas of a site that are using flash by simply entering the site URL and crawling it. However I believe this would only work for sites that are live and not local ones.p  pThe second thought would be to do a find search on terms like .swf and flash in the local code repositories and note any files that refer to those terms. This would work locally but not live.p  pI think the eventual solution may be to use a combination of different techniques to ensure ive identified all the flash content.p  pMy question is how would you guys go about doing this All effective suggestions are welcome.p  pThanksp

I am working in some other tabs also simultaneously while executing  the test case,because of which I am  finding an issue, since sikuli needs mouse cursor interaction for clicking on the image it does not click on the image whereas it remains on the same page. Can anyone suggest me if there is a way through which images can be clicked without mouse interaction, so that test case does not failp

BlackEnemy, which is their image, is a class inside a swc library, made and compiled by Flash Pro 6. its just a small ball.  the registration point of it starts in the middle if it matters.p  pProblem is, they start rather smoothly, then you can see them lagging a bit, sort of dancing while keep moving, then a second after you see them running smoothly again, and the problem repeats itself. p  pI tried placing faster timers instead of ENTERFRAME event, but I can still see some lagging. I also tried setting the configuration of FlashDevelop to release mode instead of debug and it didnt help too. If I could share the entire code somewhere so youd see the swf I will, but for now on I hope this code alone helps... Thank you for your time.p

Positive 299 pIm using dropbox to distribute large swf files with corresponding html files that load the swfs. All the large swf files access a small Key swf in the same folder as the html file. That all works fine. But when the large swf files also try to access a remote text file on my server I get a security sandbox violation. After reading about this, I see that this is by design for security reasons. p  pBut there has to be a way around this without having the user authorize the domain containing the txt file. The reason I say this is because the swf files are running right from the browser on the persons computer. I then thought about a cross domain policy. Not sure what it would look like since its a local computer thats asking. I hope this makes sense. I was hoping I could put the cross domain policy or some other file on the users computer right along with the other files, but I dont think thats what theyre for.p  pThis is an update to the question above as my problems relate to crossdomain policys.  Im showing a small snippet of code that is causing this error shown in Debug mode in the Flash IDE. The code eventually gets the txt file loaded, but is delayed due to the warning I believe and Im wondering if this can be fixed The delay is causing an issue.p  pAttempting to launch and connect to Player using URL CUsersJeffreyDropboxPhotosABCbopAnimationSalestestingGettingVariablesFromExternalSWFsimplestForm3.swf [SWF] CUsersJeffreyDropboxPhotosABCbopAnimationSalestestingGettingVariablesFromExternalSWFsimplestForm3.swf  21834 bytes after decompression Warning Domain www.postureviewer.com does not specify a metapolicy.

Negative 299 pWhen reading data in chunks of say, 1024, how do I continue to read from a socket that receives a message bigger than 1024 bytes until there is no data left Should I just use BeginReceive to read a packets length prefix only, and then once that is retrieved, use Receive in the async thread to read the rest of the packet Or is there another wayp  h2edith2  pI thought Jon Skeets link had the solution, but there is a bit of a speedbump with that code. The code I used isp  precodepublic class StateObject      public Socket workSocket  null     public const int BUFFERSIZE  1024     public byte[] buffer  new byte[BUFFERSIZE]     public StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder   public static void ReadCallbackIAsyncResult ar      StateObject so  StateObject ar.AsyncState     Socket s  so.workSocket      int read  s.EndReceivear      if read gt 0           so.sb.AppendEncoding.ASCII.GetStringso.buffer, 0, read      if read  StateObject.BUFFERSIZE          s.BeginReceiveso.buffer, 0, StateObject.BUFFERSIZE, 0,      new AyncCallbackAsyncSendReceive.ReadCallback, so     return                if so.sb.Length gt 0          All of the data has been read, so displays it to the console     string strContent     strContent  so.sb.ToString     Console.WriteLineString.FormatRead 0 byte from socket       data  1 , strContent.Length, strContent          s.Close  codepre  pNow this corrected works fine most of the time, but it fails when emthe packets size is a multiple of the bufferem. The reason for this is if the buffer gets filled on a read it is assumed there is more data but the same problem happens as before. A 2 byte buffer, for exmaple, gets filled twice on a 4 byte packet, and assumes there is more data. It then blocks because there is nothing left to read. strongThe problem is that the receive function doesnt know when the end of the packet is.strongp  phr p  pThis got me thinking to two possible solutions I could either have an endofpacket delimiter or I could read the packet header to find the length and then receive exactly that amount as I originally suggested.p  pTheres problems with each of these, though. I dont like the idea of using a delimiter, as a user could somehow work that into a packet in an input string from the app and screw it up. It also just seems kinda sloppy to me.p  pThe length header sounds ok, but Im planning on using protocol buffers  I dont know the format of the data. Is there a length header How many bytes is it Would this be something I implement myself Etc..p  pWhat should I dop

Multilingual filesp  pMost of my potential users have very little understanding of encoding the best I can hope for is it has something to do with characters and are very unlikely to be able to choose the right encoding in a list, so I would like to let them cycle through different encodings until the right one is found just by clicking on a button. p  pDisplay problems Click here to try a different encoding Well thats the concept anywayp  pWhat would be the best way to implement something like thatp  phr p  pEdit Looks like I didnt express myself clearly enough. By cycling through the encoding, I dont mean how to loop through encodings p  pWhat I meant was how to let the user try different encodings in sequence without reloading the file p  pThe idea is more like this Lets say the file is loaded with the wrong encoding. Some strange characters are displayed. The user would click a button Next encoding or previous encoding, and the string would be converted in a different encoding. The user just need to keep clicking until the right encoding is found. whatever encoding looks good for the user will do fine. As long as the user can click next, he has a reasonable chance of solving his problem.p  pWhat I have found so far involves converting the string to bytes using the current encoding, then converting the bytes to the next encoding, converting those bytes into chars, then converting the char into a string... Doable, but I wonder if there isnt an easier way to do that. p  pFor instance, if there was a method that would read a string and return it using a different encoding, something like renderstring, encoding.p  phr p  pThanks a lot for the answersp

The forms will be generated using JS based on what is in the cookies.  For example, a cookie may store things like a list of values that will be used in a select box on the form.  When the forms are submitted they will write to cookies.  The forms could be used to submit data that will likely change how the form is generated next time it is loaded...  for example, I may have a form that will allow me to enter options that will be included in another forms select box.p  pThe server portion will read these cookies, update the database and then update the cookies so that the forms are appropriately generated next time.p  pDoes this sound nuts  Would I be better off looking in to something like Google Gears  Any tips, advice or ideas would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanks in advance op

Negative 299 pSo I just finished watching this talk on the Python Global Interpreter Lock GIL a hrefhttpblip.tvfile2232410httpblip.tvfile2232410a.p  pThe gist of it is that the GIL is a pretty good design for single core systems Python essentially leaves the thread handlingscheduling up to the operating system. But that this can seriously backfire on multicore systems and you end up with IO intensive threads being heavily blocked by CPU intensive threads, the expense of context switching, the ctrlC problem[] and so on.p  pSo since the GIL limits us to basically executing a Python program on one CPU my thought is why not accept this and simply use taskset on Linux to set the affinity of the program to a certain corecpu on the system especially in a situation with multiple Python apps running on a multicore systemp  pSo ultimately my question is this has anyone tried using taskset on Linux with Python applications especially when running multiple applications on a Linux system so that multiple cores can be used with one or two Python applications bound to a specific core and if so what were the results is it worth doing Does it make things worse for certain workloads I plan to do this and test it out basically see if the program takes more or less time to run but would love to hear from others as to your experiences.p  pAddition David Beazley the guy giving the talk in the linked video pointed out that some CC extensions manually release the GIL lock and if these extensions are optimized for multicore i.e. scientific or numeric data analysisetc. then rather than getting the benefits of multicore for number crunching the extension would be effectively crippled in that it is limited to a single core thus potentially slowing your program down significantly. On the other hand if you arent using extensions such as thisp  pThe reason I am not using the multiprocessing module is that in this case part of the program is heavily network IO bound HTTP requests so having a pool of worker threads is a GREAT way to squeeze performance out of a box since a thread fires off an HTTP request and then since its waiting on IO gives up the GIL and another thread can do its thing, so that part of the program can easily run 100 threads without hurting the CPU much and let me actually use the network bandwidth that is available. As for stackless Pythonetc Im not overly interested in rewriting the program or replacing my Python stack availability would also be a concern. p  p[] Only the main thread can receive signals so if you send a ctrlC the Python interpreter basically tries to get the main thread to run so it can handle the signal, but since it doesnt directly control which thread is run this is left to the operating system it basically tells the OS to keep switching threads until it eventually hits the main thread which if you are unlucky may take a while. p

All larger web shops use category depending filters and I am still looking for the best way to implement the persistence part for this type of functionality.

At leased there will be no complex join and the properties and their values will be received as text anyway.p  pMaybe the filtering mechanism can be done client side ass well.p

Negative 299 pI am working on a library which needs to make use of the common service locator httpcommonservicelocator.codeplex.com to provide generic IOC support in order that we dont conflict with any consumers.  Obviously I dont want to reference the IOC frameworks directly in my project but Im unsure as to how to annotate the parts such that they can be found by the various frameworks.  For instance MEF usually works by finding classes with the Export annotation and LinFu by finding classes with the Implements annotation.  Both these annotations are defined within their respective projects requiring that I reference them both.p  pHow can I get away from adding all these classes and annotating all my classes multiple times  It certainly doesnt adapt well to new IOC frameworks as a rebuild would be required for each new frameworks annotations.  p

Negative 299 pIn my iPhone application XCode 3.2.4, iOS3.1.3, if I run the application in RELEASE mode, all is fine, but in DEBUG mode, the application crashes with an EXCBADACCESS exception. The application does some complex calculations. All the main code is contained in several C static libraries and the UIApplication only creates an object from one of these libraries and calls a method of this object.p  pIf I put into a secondary thread the code which calls the complex calculations, I still have the same behavior EXCBADACCESS exception in DEBUG mode and no problem in RELEASE mode.p  pThen Ive looked around the thread stack size. By default, iOS set a thread stack size with 512 Kbytes for secondary threads and 1024 Kbytes for the main thread. Ive looked the minimal required value for the thread stack size to run correctly my application. Ive found the following result 40 Kbytes for the RELEASE version. 1168 Kbytes for the DEBUG version.p  pThe value 1168 Kbytes in DEBUG version explains why in the main thread, the application will crash defaut stack size for the main thread is 1024 Kbytes.p  pI really dont understand why the required thread stack size is so different between the RELEASE and DEBUG version of my application 40 KB vs 1168 Kb .

Negative 299 pThis is inspired by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4580329stringhandlingpracticesincthis questiona and the comments on one particular answer in that I learnt that codestrncpycode is not a very safe string handling function in C and that it pads zeros, until it reaches codencode, something I was unaware of.p  pSpecifically, to quote a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers379897rR..ap  blockquote   pstrncpy does not nullterminate, and   does nullpad the whole remainder of   the destination buffer, which is a   huge waste of time. You can work   around the former by adding your own   null padding, but not the latter. It   was never intended for use as a safe   string handling function, but for   working with fixedsize fields in Unix   directory tables and database files.   snprintfdest, n, s, src is the   only correct safe strcpy in standard   C, but its likely to be a lot slower.   By the way, truncation in itself can   be a major bug and in some cases might   lead to privilege elevation or DoS, so   throwing safe string functions that   truncate their output at a problem is   not a way to make it safe or   secure. Instead, you should ensure   that the destination buffer is the   right size and simply use strcpy or   better yet, memcpy if you already know   the source string length.p blockquote  pAnd from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers15168jonathanlefflerJonathan Lefflerap  blockquote   pNote that strncat is even more   confusing in its interface than   strncpy  what exactly is that   length argument, again It isnt what   youd expect based on what you supply   strncpy etc  so it is more error   prone even than strncpy. For copying   strings around, Im increasingly of   the opinion that there is a strong   argument that you only need memmove   because you always know all the sizes   ahead of time and make sure theres   enough space ahead of time. Use   memmove in preference to any of   strcpy, strcat, strncpy,   strncat, memcpy.p blockquote  pSo, Im clearly a little rusty on the C standard library.

Negative 299 pIm having a bizarre issue where it seems as if Rails is skipping the run of my particular Action. I have two environments that I am running this in. One development works fine and runs the action. The other staging is not running the action.p  pThe error is that Rails cant find a template in the views directories for my given action, which is only supposed to respond with JSON no template. Ive done logging in the action and it just simply isnt being run. Rails immediately fails saying that the view doesnt exist.p  pJust to cover my bases, Ive verified that the code is indeed the same, that my routes file is exactly the same, and that my rails version 3.0.1 is exactly the same between the two envs. Any help would be excellent here.p

Negative 299 pI want to integrate SVN into Eclipse and came across the Subclipse project. Got this working and was able to load an already checkedout project from disk.p  pHowever, the problem is that this is an outofsource project, meaning that the source files are not in a subdirectory of the directory containing the Eclipse project file. This results in a copy of the source files in the DebugRelease folders where the object files are stored.p  pThe directory tree is then as followsp  precodeProjectroot   trunk         src              .svn         svn version control metadata              source files .cpp.hpp   trunkbuild          src               Eclipse project files               binary files codepre  pWhere I only an [Source directory] directory that showed the real source files the path Projectroottrunk, and a src directory without source files, the latter now shows the copies of the source files.

Negative 299 pIm developing an android application that utilizes Spring RestTemplate to connect to SpringMVC based web service. In REST ideology, there shouldnt be any sessions since REST is stateless. On the other hand I want my WebService to require Android application to login and authenticate before any other REST methods are called.

If the user is authenticated then I will set the session attribute user name so that I have context for further REST method calls.

Negative 299 pIm looking to parse UTF8 characters from the standard output stream of another application in my C project. Using the default approach, characters outside of the ANSI spectrum are corrupted when read from the process standard output stream.p  pNow according to Microsoft, what I need to do is set the StandardOutputEncodingp  blockquote   pIf the value of the StandardOutputEncoding property is Nothing, the process uses the default standard output encoding for the standard output. The StandardOutputEncoding property must be set before the process is started. Setting this property does not guarantee that the process will use the specified encoding. The application should be tested to determine which encodings the process supports.p blockquote  pHowever, try as I might to set StandardOutputEncoding to UTF8CP65001 the output as read, when dumped to a binary file, shows the same castration of foreign language characters. They are always read as  aka 0x3F instead of what theyre supposed to be.p  pI know the assumption at this point would be that the application whose output Im parsing is simply not sending UTF8 output, but this is definitely not the case as when I attempt to dump the output of the application to a file from the commandline after forcing the codepage of the commandprompt to 65001, everything looks fine.p  precodechcp 65001 ampamp slave.exe gt file.txt codepre  pBy this, I know for a fact that the application slave.txt is capable of spitting out UTF8encoded standard output, but try as I might, Im unable to get StandardOutputEncoding to do the same in my C application.p  pEach and every time I end up dealing with encoding in .NET, I wish I were back in the C world were everything required more work but was so much more transparent. Im contemplating writing a C application to read the output of slave.txt into a UTF8encoded text file ready for C parsing, but Im holding off on that approach for now.p

Negative 299 pI have this problem where a system contains nodes windows services that push messages to be processed and others that pull messages and process them. p  pThis has been designed in a way that the push nodes balance the load between queues by maintaining a roundrobin list of queues and rotating queues after each send. Therefore message 1 will go to queue 1, message 2 to queue 2 etc. This part has been working great so far.p  pOn the message pull end we designed it such that the messages are retrieved in a similar way  first from queue 1, then from queue 2 etc. In theory, each pull node sits on a different machine and in practice, so far, it only listened on a single queue. But a recent requirement made us have a pull node in a machine that listens to more than one queue One that typically is extremely busy and filled with millions of messages and one that generally only contains a handful of messages.p  pThe problem we are facing is that the way we architected originally the pull nodes goes from queue to queue until a message is found. If it times out say after a sec then it moves on to the next queue.p  pThis doesnt work anymore cause Q1 filled with millions of messages will be delayed approximately a second per message since after each pull from Q1 we will ask Q2 for a message and if it doesnt contain any we will wait for a second.p  pSo it goes like thisp  pQ1 contains 10 messages and Q2 contains nonep  ul liPull node asks for a message from Q1li liQ1 returns message immediatelyli liPull node asks for a message from Q1li li Waiting for a second  Q2 is empty and request times outli liPull node asks for a message from Q1li liQ1 returns message immediatelyli liPull node asks for a message from Q1li li Waiting for a second  Q2 is empty and request times outli ul  petc.p  pSo this is clearly wrong.p  pI guess I am looking for the best architectural solution here. Message processing does not need to be as realtime as possible but needs to be robust and no message should ever be lostp  pI would like to hear your views on this problem.p  pThank in advance Yannisp

Negative 299 pPretty soon now, were gonna need to develop a GUI for creating configurations more like scripts, to be honest for our EAI solution at work. Think of a typical workflow editor. The visualization of the actual flows will most likely be a completely custom job, either in Swing, SWT or JavaFX 2. What I have trouble with choosing is whether to do everything else by ourselves or using a rich client platform.p  pIn particular, Ive noticed that JavaFX 2 is getting a lot of attention and seems to be really pushed by Oracle as the next big thing in the Java GUI landscape. The demonstrations look interesting and perhaps this newer API is more closely focused on productivity as opposed to the tons of boilerplate code that Swing tends to impose. Using a newer technology that gets a lot of support seems like a safe bet for future maintenance.p  pUsing an RCP would have definite benefits for this project. Whether we go for Eclipse or NetBeans as the platform, having existing pluginsmodules for viewing the underlying XML config, version control etc. would offer powerful functionality with minimal work. I also like the idea of having project types of our software next to Java projects in the same GUI. Even simple stuff like window management and customly arranging panels is much better handled by RCPs that what we could whip up.p  pSo the question now is, what technology or combination thereof is viable My options, as far as I can see, are thusp  ul liEclipse. Im not too eager for using SWT, though, since Im more familiar with Swing. NetBeans is also my primary IDE and Im most familiar with it. It always felt more intuitive too.li liNetBeans. Thisd allow development of custom components in Swing. A lower learning curve for me.li liNetBeans  JavaFX 2. This idea appeals to me... Use NetBeans for the RCP goodness and using JavaFX 2 for custom components. JavaFX 2 apparently integrates with Swing, but how well can this be done within NetBeansli liSwing or JavaFX 2. Do all the GUI work ourselves or use some existing frameworks to get most of what an RCP offers. This seems like a lot of work but also offers superb control. Im a bit loathe to try this in Swing. How well would JavaFX 2 suit itself to thisli ul  pBasically my only GUI experience is in Swing on small apps. This is the first time Ill be going for something that would warrant a RCP. But JavaFX 2 seems the way forward and I dont want to miss the boat on that one. If Swing might be on the way out, Id prefer hopping onboard the newer technology.p  pIf there are people who can share their experiences, have tried something like NetBeans  JavaFX 2 or are closer to the forefront of JavaFX and can recommenddiscourage its use for this sort of thing Id be most interested.p  pI realize its a somewhat open question, but I cant really think of a more appropriate place. Im not looking for a whats the best RCP  is JavaFX better than Swing debate. Im looking for valid points foragainst their use in this context.p

Negative 299 h1What is considered the Rails Way for Ajax Formsh1  pUntil today I thought the way I use Rails forms  jQuery UJS was the right way to do it, but the upgrade to jQuery 1.7 broked the way I did it so far.p  h2How to do thish2  pI want to use Ajax with my forms. The ajax response should either render the form again e.g. when errors occur or redirect to a success page. It should maybe do more, like showing modals, but I want to keep this example simple.p  h31. Using EJS and formid.html... h3  pThat is what I did until to date. My ajax response was an ejs template which returned javascript code to render the form again with errors or depending if it was an error redirected the user to success page p  precodelt unless successsubmit gt formwrapper.htmllt escapejavacsript render partial gt form  gt  lt else gt document.location  successthankyou lt endif gt codepre  pNow imagine the form contains an error message div likep  precodeltdiv classerrormessagegtBlaBlaltdivgt codepre  pTo add a nice effect I had a general jQuery.live event bound on ajax complete which highlighted errors.p  precodeform.liveajaxcomplete, function      do stuff like highlighting all error messages in that form   codepre  pThat doesnt work with jQuery1.7  jqueryujs anymore probably by good reasons. So I guess the way I did it was not right.p  h32. Using above way but repeat myselfh3  pInstead of binding the ajaxcomplete event I could do the error highlighting stuff in the EJS likep  precodeformwrapper.htmllt escapejavascript render partial gt form  gt formwrapper form .errormessage.fadeIn codepre  pBut that would mean I would have to repeat the second line in almost each EJS which renders forms. And of course I want to keep it DRY. p  h33. Ajax response renders pure html, ajaxcomplete event handles display h3  pA complete different solution would be that the ajax response simply would render pure html and my custom ajaxcomplete handler would take care of displaying the form. The handler would look likep  precodeform.liveajaxsuccess, functionev, data, status, xhr    this.htmldata    and e.g. highlight stuff   this.children.errormessage.fadeIn  codepre  pThat would work. But now what should I do if my server decides not to render the form again e.g. after successful signup but instead redirect to another url or showing a modal form. The server could respond with something like thatp  precodeltscriptgt    document.location  success.blabla ltscriptgt codepre  pBut is that a good solution p  h34. Custom JSON protocol h3  pProbably a good solution would be to use version 3 but instead of simply replacing the current form with the returned html we could create some custom json protocol. That way we could even let the server respond with stuff likep  ol lifirst show modal  like Signup Successli liredirect to login pageli ol  pThe ajaxsuccess handler could check if the response is pure html, in that case it would replace the current form with the html code. But if the response is a JSON array it would handle that, e.g. server responds with p  precode html lt render partial gt something gt,    showmodal  lt render partial gt modaltemplate gt,   redirectaftermodal loginpage  codepre  pThe ajaxsuccess handler would have handle it like p  precodeform.liveajaxsuccess, functionev, data, status, xhr      try parsing json    if data.json[showmodal   show modal code....      if data.json[redirect]  document.locationdata.json[redirect]...  codepre  h2How are you doing this stuff h2  pObviously there are many ways how you handle ajax forms. But how are you doing it, and what is considered best practice with Rails p

Negative 299 pSo, recently I have been trying to build a user interface form builder that is almost entirely drag and drop. Kind of like Dreamweaver or visual studios I suppose. You guys can see it for yourselves a hrefhttpcaidenhome.comjQueryFormBuilderbuilder.html relnofollowHEREa I am trying to get a rightclick menu thing going, however upon getting a hrefhttpabeautifulsite.netblog200809jquerycontextmenuplugin relnofollowthisa working, I realized that it really conflicted with both the draggable and resizable methods. I dont have to right click at all, however when I go to resize or drag, it wont let me stop it. My cursor gets stuck either resizing or dragging, and requires vigorous clicking and shaking to free it. So, Im assuming that I need a different plugin. Does anybody know of a stress free simple rightclick menu that is hopefully compatible with jquery ui Ive tried google but most of them are simply a different version of the one Ive already been using.p  pMy second question is much more vague. As I previously mentioned, Im trying to make a form builder. Im wondering what the best way to go about this is as I feel sort of lost. My biggest problems right now are figuring out how Im going to parse everything into code and export it. Does anybody know of anyone else who has attempted this or something similar Is there any sort of guidep  pI know the second questions has potential to be rather annoying, so feel free to only focus on the first one. Any help is appreciated, and I thank everybody who helps me.p  pstrongEDITstrong Just realized that you guys may not know how to use the builder. So far, all you can do is drag panels out onto the building space, and then drag tables within the panels. You can resize the building space, and panels vertically, and you can resize tables both vertically and horizontally. You can move panels and tables within their parent elements. Right click a panel or table for the contextmenu.p  pstrongEDITstrong So I think I found a context menu that will suffice, a hrefhttptahirhassan.blogspot.com201011jquerycontextmenu.html relnofollowherea it is. So, I guess that only leaves giving me advice on how to go about constructing this form builder.p

Negative 299 pIm trying to parse a simple key  value query language. Ive actually accomplished it with a huge monstrosity parser that I then make a second pass through to clean up the parse tree. What Id like to do is make a clean parse from the bottom up, which includes things like using sets for the key,val pairs so redundant pairs are eliminated etc. While I got it working before, I dont feel like I fully understood why pyparsing was acting the way it was, so I did a lot of work arounds etc, sort of fighting against the grain.p  pCurrently, here is the beginning of my simplified parserp  precodefrom pyparsing import      boolact  lambda t boolt[0] intact   lambda t intt[0]  def keyvalactinstring, loc, tokens     return set[tokens.k, tokens.v]  def keyinactinstring, loc, tokens     return set[tokens.k, settokens.vs]  string         Wordalphas  , alphanums        quotedString.setParseAction removeQuotes       boolean         CaselessLiteraltrue      CaselessLiteralfalse      integer  Wordnums.setParseAction intact  value         boolean.setParseActionboolact      integer      string      keyval  stringk  Suppress  valuev           .setParseActionkeyvalact keyin       stringk  SuppressCaselessLiteralin      nestedExpr,, content  delimitedListvaluevs     .setParseActionkeyinact  grammar  keyin  stringEnd  keyval  stringEnd codepre  pCurrently, the grammar nonterminal is just a stub, I will eventually add nestable conjunctions and disjunctions to the keys so that searches like this can be parsedp  precodea  1, b  2 , c in 1,2,3  d  4,  e  5  e  2, f  3, f  4 codepre  pFor now though, I am having trouble understanding how pyparsing calls my setParseAction functions.

Negative 299 pI have a facebook timeline page tab app thats running inside an IFRAME on a fan page.p  pOn the main page of the app, we show 10 jobs and users can click through to the detail page of one single book.p  pWe want to add a LIKE button on those detail pages, so that users on facebook can like and share that job in their stream.p  pThe app is totally dynamic so different customers can install the app on their fan page and list their own jobs. ex. cocacola installs it on his cocacola page and lists jobs within the company. then microsoft installs it as well and does the samep  pThe problem concerns ogmetatags and redirection of the liked detail page link, right inside the right facebook company page and relative right detail page showing the job.p  pI can get these two things done and working but not at the same timep  pA. Facebook gets correctly the ogmetatags in the head section, with image, title, description when I use the following implementation of the like button without datahref extra attributep  precode    ltdiv classfblike                datasendfalse               datalayoutbuttoncount               datashowfacesfalse               dataactionlike               datafontarialgt     ltdivgt codepre  pThe problem is that not specifying the datahref attribute and the ogurl meta is totally ignored this is gonna create a link to the current page  intended current page inside an iframe  so the result will be that when you click the shared job on facebook you will be redirected NOT inside the facebook app right page right detail page, but to the detail page on the server that hostes the app.p  pB. If I instead specify the datahref attributep  precode   ltdiv classfblike                datahreflt httpwww.facebook.compagespagesession[fbpageid]vappXXXXXXXampappdatajobdetails.jobid gt               datasendfalse               datalayoutbuttoncount               datashowfacesfalse               dataactionlike               datafontarialgt     ltdivgt codepre  pDoing this I can get the right link posted on facebook so then using ampappdata attribute I can get the perfect redirection working. BUT on the downside, the ogmetatags are totally ignored and instead facebook picks the page tab metatags top iframe that hostes the pagetab app and so I get posted on facebook a crap link that tells about a page on facebook with the page app picture. And the even bigger downside is that when you like a job on the app, all the jobs appear to be liked as well basically the iFrame app becomes the liked page... instead of being the job detail page picked as liked pagep  pIs out there any genius that knows how to sort this out I need to get the A an B working at the same time to get the requested resultp  pPlease help p

When the strongcron.phpstrong script is called by the servers crontab schedule it dispatches an event that this class catches and does its work.  Among other things it pulls in the config and attempts to schedule the upcoming cron jobs.  Inside codepublic function tryScheduletimecode it calls codematchCronExpressioncode, passing it the piece of the cron expression in question along with the value of the current time corresponding with that piece of the cron expression.  For example, it compares the first part of the strongcronexprstrong the emminutesem part to the minutes of the current timestamp.  At the end of the codematchCronExpressioncode function it returns a boolean value like sop  precodereturn numgtfrom ampamp numltto ampamp nummod0 codepre  pIn my case, my strongcronexprstrong is code0 16   code.  Since I dont have any ranges or code5code type stuff for my emminutesem portion, it is comparing the exact value I set against the exact value of the current timestamp.  This means it will ONLY return true if it happened to run the cron script at the exact minute that this job should be scheduled.p  pAgain, I am not a cron expert but this doesnt seem right to me.

Negative 299 pAlright, so judging by the title if you practice Ruby, you should know what Ocra is. If you dont, heres a brief explanationpOcra is a command added to the command prompt in order to convert ruby programs to executable. So .rb to .exe.p In order for one to convert a ruby program to executable, they would type in the command prompt p  precodecd ltlocationOfFilegt ocra rubyProgram.rb codepre  pand then ocra would run the program and when thats done, it runs some scripts which completes the program. Then afterwards the executable version of the program would be in the same directory as the original ruby version and the same name. p So recently I noticed that my antiviruses are removing the program from my computer telling me its a bloodhound. Its getting really annoying and Im getting tired of having to use ocra over and over again just to remake a program. p I have two antiviruses McAffee and Symnatec so that means double the security. What can I change so that my antiviruses ignore the programp

Negative 299 pIm using codepthreadmutextrylockcode to lock the mutex on a struct so that it can only be accessedmodified by a single thread at a given time.

Im assuming this because it prints Trying to lock for both threads at the same time, but does not print whether or not the mutex was locked. I was originally having this problem with codepthreadmutexlockcode so tried the nonblocking version for this reason, but it still seems to block.p  pThis doesnt always happen but when it does its always the strongfirst twostrong calls to the routine.

Things like accessing files, committing, and uploading the files.p  pI wrote a syntax highlighted text editor for iOS, and now that Apple seems to be blocking any new apps that use dropbox, Im thinking its about time to make it work with svngit, but since I use git more than svn it might be worth checking out these first.p  pSo yeah, any libraries available for accessing gitsvn repositories convenientlyp

Negative 299 pI have a need to use a different implementation class for an interface when Im testing an Android Activity than when it runs in production.  Im familiar with using mock objects, but the problem is that an Activity on Android is instantiated by the OS and not by me, so by the time I get a reference to the Activity, it has already been instantiated and already has used the implementation class.  In my case, the class Im talking about is a Login class.  For my automated tests, I want to be able to control the login result.  Here is my examplep  precodeclass MainActivity extends Activity       public void onCreateBundle savedState          super.onCreatesavedState         setContentViewR.layout.main         LoginMgr aLoginMgr  new LoginMgrImpl         if aLoginMgr.authenticated              do something          else              do something else                  public interface LoginMgr      public boolean authenticated  codepre  pElsewhere in a library I have an implementation classp  precodepublic class LoginMgrImpl implements LoginMgr      authenticate  codepre  pDuring an automated test, I want to be able to replace the production LoginMgrImpl with a test version that will return the boolean I need for my test.  This is where I need help as I cannot see how I can get the MainActivity to use a different LoginMgrImpl.  Im using Eclipse if that matters.  The ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2 test class creates the MainActivity for me when I call getActivity.  It calls the no arg constructor, so I dont have a chance to change LoginMgrImpl there.  Eclipse controls the build, so I dont see a way to have MainActivity built with a different implementation library.  p  pCan any of you more experienced folks point me in a direction to successfully automate my test  I cant be the only one trying to mock some test classes used by Activity objects, but Ive spent hours trying to find a solution in the forums with no success.  HELPp  p Based on feedback from everyone, I tried various solutions and found two that I can live with.p  pSOLUTION 1  One is explained in the marked answer and involves setting up a separate Project in Eclipse that has symbolic links to the original src, res, assets folders as well as to the AndroidManifest.xml.  I can then modify the project properties for the linked version of the project to reference a different library implementation that supports my test.  This works, but feels kludgy.p  pp  pSOLUTION 2 Define an Application subclass for my project which keeps a singleton instance of the implementation of LoginMgr.  The MainActivity will then retrieve the LoginMgr from the Application instance.  During testing I can use ActivityUnitTestCase to inject a mock Application that references a mock LoginMgr.  Here are the code snippetsp  pMain Application be sure AndroidManifest.xml includes  p  precodeclass MainApplication extends Application       private static LoginMgr sLoginMgr  new LoginMgrImpl      public LoginMgr getLoginMgr          return sLoginMgr        codepre  pMainActivity has to be modified asp  precodeclass MainActivity extends Activity       public void onCreateBundle savedState          super.onCreatesavedState         setContentViewR.layout.main           2 lines added         MainApplication aApplication  MainApplicationgetApplication         LoginMgr aLoginMgr  aApplication.getLoginMgr          if aLoginMgr.authenticated              do something          else              do something else                codepre  pThe unit test must be something like thisp  precodepublic class MainActivityTest extends ActivityUnitTestCaseltMainActivitygt     public MainActivityTest      superMainActivity.class       public void testUseAlternateLoginMgr      MainApplication aMockApplication  new MainApplication            Override       public LoginMgr getLoginMgr          return new LoginMgr            public boolean authenticated                            return true                                      setApplicationaMockApplication      Intent aDependencyIntent  new Intentandroid.intent.action.MAIN     Activity aMainActivity  startActivityaDependencyIntent, null, null      verify results     codepre  pI would probably use a mock framework instead of a hand coded mock, but this is just an illustration.  p  pI think solution 2 is the better way to go.

Negative 299 pI have a number of jQuery addons used by my Rails app. Almost all pages use the jQuery.cookies extension to determine whether a specific element should be shown or hidden.p  pThis addin was originally its own file under assetsjavascripts, and loaded using the following manifestp  precode require jquery  require jqueryujs  require jqueryui  requireself  requiredirectory . there is a subdirectory im ignoring, but jquery.cookies isnt in it codepre  pOn Internet Explorer, jquery.cookies.js was being evaluated on every page that required it except for two, where the codecookiescode object was not being added to the codejQuerycode.

Negative 299 pDoes an immutable object in python mean that its value cannot be changed after its conception If that is the case what will happen when we try to change its value. p  pLet me try to explain my doubt with an example.p  pFor instance I initialized a String object codeScode with value codeHello Worldcode.p  precodeS  Hello World codepre  pThen I typed in the line, p  precodeS  Hello Human codepre  pSo when I ask the interpreter, it tells me the value of S is codeHello Humancode. Clearly now S has a new value.p  pHow did the value change Did python destroy the old string object and created a new one with the new value or did it just changed the value of the old object. Does this has anything to do with the fact that the string object is immutable If so, then how do mutable objects behavep

But what disappoints me is that the performance is not good enough.p  ul lipIt uses HTTP as the way to stream video, which result in lots of wasted bandwidth. My test results for a 1280x720 video is more than 1MBs, and for 640x480 video is about 300KBs.pli lipIt does not stream audio at the same time.pli ul  pI found out that the Mjpgstreamer project is developing a module for RTSP streaming, but its far from completion. So I want to know if there are open source projects that meet my requirementsbandwidth efficient, and stream audio at the same time but not necessarily solved with one software only.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 299 pIm using CakePHP 1.2.4 and I have two search filters in a search form that interact this way  a dropdownlist is populated with countries and another ddl is populated with the states of the country selected in the first ddl.p  pThis is done with ajaxp  pI need to call the ajax function when the page is refreshed when theyre used in a search form else the states ddl is not populated again.p  pThese dropdownlists are also used in other types of views. For example, on an editaddress.ctp page, the selected values when opening the page would be the ones saved in the database.p  pHowever, on the editaddress.ctp page I need not to update the values on refresh or onload, because I dont want the states to be updated unless the user change the country manually.p  precode    .ajaxSelect.eachfunction     this.changefunction         updateSelectthis          call function on load only for filters in a search form     ifthis.closest.frmSearch.length gt 0         if.ajaxSelect optionselected.text               this.changeupdateSelectthis.change                codepre  pIt works fine with this function but then in editaddress.ctp, if the user change the country without saving it and refreshes the page, the states are reseted to match the default country BUT the country selected remains the one selected before refreshing so the states dont match anymore with the country.p  pHeres an example of the countries filterp  precodeltselect idAddressCountryId classajaxSelect linkedAddressRegionId methodgetRegion namedata[Address][countryid]gt codepre  pAnd the states filterp  precodeltselect idAddressRegionId namedata[Address][regionid]gt codepre  pvardumpPOST is empty when refreshing so I cannot access selected values this way in the address controller.p  pThe other thing I can think of is, in the ajax function above, to check if the selected state in the view matches the country selected, by calling a method from the model.

Negative 299 pSo I understand that, in Android, a smart phone can be configured in emulation mode to emulate a given NFC tag. What Im curious about is whether there is a way to identify an NFC reader through some sort of unique id during the NFC handshake.p  pFor example, lets say I use a few NFCcompatible tags on a daily basis...say a fuel rewards card, my security badge for work, and my major brand credit card. Is it possible to automatically emulate the correct tag based on the reader detected by the phone, so that when I tap at the fuel pump my fuel perks tag is emulated, when I tap the sensor at work my badge is emulated, and when I tap at whatever retail store my credit card is emulatedp

Negative 299 pIm new to iOS programming and Im spending way too much time on something that is supposed to be relatively easy to implement. Surely this is a beginners question, but I just cant seem to find an answer.p  pIm currently developing an iOS VoIP app. At this stage the system will switch to a CallingViewController whenever a call is set up. Whenever the call is disconnected the view should disappear pop. p  pMy hierarchyp  ul liWindowbr ul linavigationController  UINavigationController window.rootViewController ul liAppController  UIViewController navigationController.rootView ul liTabBarController  UITabBarController ul liDialerViewController  UIViewControllerli ulli liLoginViewController  UIViewControllerli liCallingViewController  UIViewControllerli ulli ulli ulli ul  pI imagined AppController to be the class which loads and hides views based on states and events being triggered by all the VoIP related coding. p  pFor instance in the AppController I use code [self.navigationController pushViewControllertabBarController animatedYES] code. Pushing a controller does not seem to cause any problems, everything functions as expected. p  pPushing tabBarController causes DialerView to get focus it is for now the only view in te tab, later it will for instance contain Dialer, Settings, Contacts, Call History. The user enters a number and presses VoIP Call. Via callbacks voiplibraryOnCallStateChange  eventually AppController.OnCallStateChange the system can determine the state of Call callId has changed to SET UP and will push in AppController code [self.navigationController pushViewControllerCallingViewController animatedYES] code. p  pThrough the same callback function the system will also determine that the call had ended. Yet, using popViewController or any variant, it does not  work. The ViewController stays on top. I started logging using NSLog and it appears the CallingView loads, willappear, didappear and willdisappear. DidDisappear will not get called however. The system also did determine the call was terminated, checked via NSLog again. So whatever code I use to get rid of the CallingViewController will get executed it seems, however the View does not change. p

Negative 299 pMy app is based on a navigation controller that contains a a custom view controller which embed two view controllers. The first one is an UICollectionViewController for which I have designed the cell via IB. Cell contains an imageview and a label. On the execution the app shows correctly all the cells with their images and related labels, but only some of them trigger the DidSelect event when you touch them. I have tried to change the cell position on the screen changing the interspace setting within IB, and in this way some of the cells that before were insensitive now are sensitive and vice versa. I have also checked that both image and label are user interactive.p  pAny suggestions Many thanksp

Negative 299 pI used Criterion library to write benchmarks for my Haskell functions. Now I am implementing the same algorithm in C to compare performance with Haskell. The question is how can I do it reliably Criterion does a lot of fancy stuff like accounting for clock call overhead and doing statistical analysis of the results. I guess that if I just measure time needed by my C function it will not be comparable with the results returned by Criterion. In his a hrefhttpwww.serpentine.comblog20090929criterionanewbenchmarkinglibraryforhaskelloriginal post about Criteriona Bryan OSullivan writes It should even be easy to use criterion to benchmark C code and command line programs. The question is how Takayuki Muranushi a hrefhttpen.pk.paraisolang.orgHackagewhatisthefastestdftinhaskellmaincompares C implementation of DFTa with Haskell by spawning threads and calling the executable but I fear that this adds a lot of additional overhead create new thread, run the application, output to stdio and then reading from it which makes the results incomparable. I also considered using FFI, but again I fear that additional overhead would make such comparison unfair.p  pIf there is no way of using Criterion to reliably benchmark C, then what approaches to C benchmarking would you recommend Ive read some questions here on SO and it seems that there are many different functions that allow to measure system time, but they either provide time in milliseconds or have large call overhead.p

There are examples that use the old NPR proxy code that opens a local web server in the Android App, downloads content remotely, and outputs requested data to any listening sockets, however that code is more than 2 years old and its still used as the standard for accomplishing this task even though a lot of people report that there are stuttering issues, etc.p  pIve looked into the MediaPlayer class and wanted to extend it to allow this behaviour however a lot of the implementation is accomplished through native code, and from what Ive read, different device manufacturers implement the native audio functionality differently and if so, I dont want to touch it  .p  pSo, strongwhat is the best method to store AND concurrently stream incoming audio data MP3 or OGG from a remote serverstrong, without discarding the data Preferably with versions of Android 2.2 and above, but input on any available API would be appreciated.p

Ive tried simply adding...p  precodeltmarshal refnotificationProto gt codepre  p...after the recipientList has been determined but it doesnt do it I assume because Camel has already dispatched the messages by then.p  pAn alternative could be to do the unmarshalling from within the bean as then the data on the exchange will presumably remain unaltered.

Negative 299 pI am trying to write a libgdx livewallpaper OpenGL ES 2.0 which will display a unique background image non splittable into sprites. p  pI want to target tablets, so I need to somehow be able to display at least strong1280x800strong background image on top of which a lot more action will also happen, so I need it to render as fast as possible.p  pNow I have only basic knowledge both about libgdx and about opengl es, so I do not know what is the best way to approach this.p  pBy googling I found some optionsp  ul lisplit texture into smaller textures. It seems like GLMAXTEXTURESIZE on most devices is at least em1024x1024em, but I do not want to hit max, so maybe I can use em512x512em, but wouldnt that mean drawing a lot of tiles, rebinding many textures on every frame  low performanceli lilibgdx has a hrefhttpcode.google.complibgdxwikiGraphicsTileMapsGraphicsTileMapsa which seems to be the tool to automate drawing tiles. But it also has support for many features mapping info to tiles that I do not need, maybe it would be better to use splitting by handli ul  pAgain, the main point here is performance for me  because drawing background is expected to be the most basic thing, more animation will be on top of itp  pAnd with tablet screen growing in size I expect soon Ill need to be able to comfortably render even bigger image sizes p  pAny advice is greatly appreciated p

Imagine 10 people use it for 10 minutes, with autorefresh set for 10 seconds.. it will amount to 10x6x10  600 API calls And that is only for 10 people for 10 minutes, and what if they are online for 1 monthp  pSo having a callback which notifies only if there is a strongNEWstrong review will greatly of help here.p  pIs there actually a way doing this that Ive missed, or other workarounds Thanksp

Negative 299 pI have a frontend running on an IIS web server on port 80. It is written in HTML5 using the angular.js framework.p  pI have a RESTful backend running on a GlassFish application server on port 8084. It is written using the Jersey JAXRS implementation.p  pThe backend uses a Neo4J database which is created in the constructor of a Singleton class. So when there doesnt exist an instance of said class, the database is created. If the instance does exist, it uses the same GraphDatabaseService which was stored as an attribute. I do this to prevent Lock Store errors. If the class wasnt a singleton, it would every time try to create a new GraphDatabaseService to the same databasepath, and you can only have one at a time.p  pThe needs for my application have changed however. A login will be required, and every user will get his own database. The username will be used in the databasepath and has to be passed on to the what now still is a singleton class. p  pHow can I change my setup, so that every user gets his own database, and that every RESTcall that user makes, is performed on that database. Users should be able to simultaneously use the web application.p

Negative 299 pIm running into real trouble trying to complete a practical that requires using strategy and composite pattern. I am trying to create a collection of vehicles which can have different behavior depending on the surface they are on. However, these vehicles can have more than one behaviour on a surface  for example, they could have snow drive and rain drive at the same time, if the weather conditions are set to snow and rain.p  pI have a class called AbstractVehicle, which has two concrete subclasses, Car and Boat.p  pI then have an interface called IBehaviour. Implementing this interface is two abstract classes called LandBehaviour and WaterBehaviour which are the top tier of the composite pattern. Each of these have a collection of subclasses. Focussing solely on LandBehaviour, its subclasses are SnowBehaviour, StandardBehaviour and a few others including LandAssembly.p  pThe idea was that I would put the code for the uppertier of composite in LandBehaviour. Then, each of the concrete subclasses would have empty implementations of the add, remove and list parts of composite, with the LandAssembly class containing the code needed to actually combine various behaviours together.p  pThis is intended to produce the result that, for example, a car could have both StandardBehaviour and SnowBehaviour at the same time.p  pRather than posting large amounts of code and there is a lot of it, I was hoping for some feedback on the basic structure I am trying to implement. I am getting a few errors right now such as null pointer exceptions and rather than spent a long time trying to fix them, I wanted to get an idea on whether the layout of the project was right to begin with.p  pstrongEdit Adding code  which generates a null pointer exceptionstrongp  pThis is my AbstractVehicle classp  precodepublic AbstractVehicle IBehaviour behaviourIn      behaviour  behaviourIn   public void setBehaviourIBehaviour ib      behaviour  ib   public IBehaviour getBehaviour      return behaviour   public void move      behaviour.ensureCorrectBehaviour  codepre  pThe car subclassp  precodepublic Car       supernew StandardBehaviour  codepre  pThe IBehaviour interfacep  precodepublic interface IBehaviour      public void ensureCorrectBehaviour  codepre  pThe LandBehaviour abstract classp  precodepublic void ensureCorrectBehaviour    public ILandBehaviour     private ILandBehaviour landBehaviour  public ILandBehaviour ILandBehaviour landBehaviour      this.landBehaviour  landBehaviour   public ILandBehaviour getBehaviour      return landBehaviour   public abstract void addBehaviourILandBehaviour behaviour public abstract void removeBehaviourILandBehaviour behaviour public abstract ILandBehaviour[] getBehaviours codepre  pAn example of a concrete behaviour subclass RacingBehaviourp  precodepublic RacingBehaviourILandBehaviour landBehaviour      superlandBehaviour   public RacingBehaviour   Override public void ensureCorrectBehaviour      System.out.printlnVehicle is racing.   public void addBehaviourILandBehaviour behaviour  public void removeBehaviourILandBehaviour behaviour  public ILandBehaviour[] getBehaviours      return null  codepre  pAnd finally the LandAssembly classp  precodepublic class LandAssembly extends ILandBehaviour   private ListltILandBehaviourgt behaviours  public LandAssemblyILandBehaviour landBehaviour      superlandBehaviour     behaviours  new ArrayListltILandBehaviourgt   public LandAssembly   public void addBehaviourILandBehaviour behaviour      behaviours.addbehaviour   public void removeBehaviourILandBehaviour behaviour      behaviours.removebehaviour   public ILandBehaviour[] getBehaviours      return behaviours.toArraynew ILandBehaviour[behaviours.size]      codepre  pI am using this runnerp  precode    AbstractVehicle aCar  new Car120     aCar.move      ILandBehaviour snow  new SnowBehaviour     ILandBehaviour racing  new RacingBehaviour     ILandBehaviour as  new LandAssembly     as.addBehavioursnow     as.addBehaviourracing codepre  pBefore I implemented the composite, everything was fine. I was able to use the client to create a new car, call its move method, then change its behaviour, call move again and see the difference.

Negative 299 pI would like to know the best way to tell if a Shape object intersects another shape. Currently I have collision detection in my game sorted out as long as it involves a Shape intersecting a Rectangle or vice versa. The problem Im having is that the intersects method in the Shape class can only take a Rectangle or a Point as a parameter, not another Shape. Is there an efficient way to test if two Shape objects are overlapping in any way  One way I tried was using a for loop to generate an area of points to test if they were in the shape, and then building an array of Point objects to send to the other shape to test, but this significantly dropped my framerate because of all of the unnecessary comparisons.p  pI looked and looked for something similar on here but didnt find anything really.

Negative 299 pI have a list of lists of Integer that Im using to build chains based on an input file. The input specifies pairs e.g. 3, 1 indicates that 1 replaces 3 in the application, and there are overlaps in the pairs e.g. 3, 1 and 1, 4 would mean that 1 replaces 3 and 4 replaces 1, so ultimately, 4 replaces 3.p  pIn order to reduce all of the pairs into their final chains, I have a list containing lists of all the pairs, and then I find which entries in the list overlap and append to the chains as needed, removing the pair that has been appended to another.

Negative 299 pIve been working on a generic 2d tile style game. Currently In my main thread I have a loop that just goes as fast as it possibly can and calls the repaint method of a JPanel that is in another class which handles the game stuff. It looks like thisp  precodepublic class Main      public static void mainString[] args          Island test  new Island         whiletrue              test.getCanvas.requestFocus             test.getCanvas.repaint                codepre  pgetCanvas just returns the JPanel.p  pCurrently this has done what Ive wanted, now that Ive started adding movement for a player and obviously I dont want to move him across the screen as fast as I possibly can. So I have an input map and action map in my Island class and that detects the key presses and releases and tells my player class which keys are being held. I then move my player about inside the player class with a swing timer that calls every 10ms. So I guess this is like my game tick, my game will make frames as fast as it possibly can and then the game does all its logic stuff 100 times a second, I will be adding more to the gamelogic of course, not just movement.p  pAfter doing some research it would appear a swing timer isnt the best way of doing this as it is designed for doing small tasks and for swing tasks. So I guess my question is, is it sensible to make my frames the way I am in my main method, and what would be a good way of getting my game to tick reliably every 10ms or whatever Ive had a few ideas, like maybe I should make a new thread that handles the game logic and use the System.getnanotime or whatever its called to measure the time taken to do a tick and then do a wee thread.sleep for however long it is until we reach 10ms and then repeat.p  pI am happy to post more code if you want , and thanks in advance.p

Negative 299 pI need to redo a custom connection pool of objects.  The connection pool essentially is a codeConcurrentLinkedQueuecode of objects, each of which performs actions against a thirdparty server Cognos.  Each object in the pool contains a token codeStringcode which is used to send requests to the thirdparty server.  The thirdparty server will expire a token after 60 minutes of inactivity.  I need to keep the token from expiring because creating a connection from scratch with the thirdparty server can take several seconds.  I found a way to keep the tokens from expiring, but I dont know how to incorporate this into an opensource connection pool solution like C3PO or BoneCP.  Or whether this keep alive logic should be performed outside of the pool, or within each object itself.p  pDoes it make sense to have a timer within each connection object that will do the logic that keeps the token active say every 10 minutesp

Negative 299 pFirstly, I am sorry if this is quite a vague question, it is quite difficult to explain and quite bizarre and it also does not seem like a particularly specific problem. but I will do my best to explain herep  pI have a C .net application which forks a new thread to do most of its work  with the primary thread just handling a GUI front end.p  precodesyncThread  new Threadnew ThreadStartsyncClass.sync codepre  pThe sync thread loops continuously...p  precodepublic void sync               while true                     do stuff codepre  pAnd at the end, has a sleep to stop it hogging CPU all of the time...p  precodeSystem.Threading.Thread.Sleepsyncinterval codepre  pTo fill in some background, what it does in do stuff is connect to Sage using Sages API, and connect to a SOAP service and basically pull data from Sage and push to the SOAP. This works fine HOWEVER...p  pWhat appears to be happening is that at random intervals the thread just stops executing  as though it has just gone away. I have logged to screen and to a file to try and find a particular cause for this but it stops at different parts of its process almost every time.p  pI have tried catching errors and logging these to screen and to file as well as logging code execution progress to file  but when this happens  it simply does not throw an error or if it does, I am not able to catch it. So I am completely stuck. p  pTo add to the bizarreness  this does not seem to happen on every system it is installed on but does happen on more than just the odd one.p  pWithout any caught errors to fix, and no set area of code to investigate for the problem because as I say  it is not consistent I am completely stumped as to how to proceed. p  pSo  are there any general threading issues that anyone is aware of that could cause this behaviour Is there a better way for me to go about the threading in the first place, or can anyone offer any further advice on how to find and trap the error so that I can fix itp  pPlease help p

If no row in the second table exists, I wont turn on this indicator.li liTo search for all rows in firsttable which have at least one row in secondtable, or which dont have rows in the second table.li ol  pAnother option I just foundp  precodeselect a.index, b.index  from firsttable a  left join select distinctindex as index from secondtable b on a.index  b.index codepre  pThis way I will get null for b.index if it doesn exist display can finally be adapted, Im concerned on query performance here. p  pThe final objective of this question is to find a proper design approach for this kind of case. It happens often, a real application culd be a POS system to show all clients and have one icon in the list as an indicator wether the client has open orders. p

Negative 299 pIm creating a validator that will be able to handle complex conditions by allowing the dev to use a conditional statement in the conditions rules.p  pTake this example with a set of rulesp  precode... elementname      required conditional,      conditions            requirements  4 lt 5,          requirements  something  somethingelse         ... codepre  pwhat the PHP will then do is loop through those coderequirementscode and evaluate them as code to return a boolean which will determine if the element is required or not.p  pThe problem with using the codeevalcode function is quite obvious. So Im asking, given that condition statements are what will only be allowed, is there a safer way of doing this thanp  precoderesult  evalelementnamegtrequirements[0] codepre  pThank you guys.p  p UPDATE p  pThank you Mike and everyone for the ideas, I wish I could mark you all as the answer because to be quite honest, I ended up using a little bit of everyones idea. More of Mikes so he gets it.p  pSo, this is probably something that is going to be looked at in the future because its quite an attractive method of conditionally validating a field. My goal is to create an intuitive way of going about this. I liked the idea of simply slapping in a conditional statement right in the json config file. Of course, this would involve some serious security risks or a super complex parsing engine, so I ended requiring the dev to learn our method of conditional language, but as you will see, I kept it quite similar to the original one. I think its important to have simple APIs otherwise youll deter development on your platform. Check it outp  precodeelementname      required conditional,      conditions            lt  [4, 5],            [elementid, otherelement],  will grab the values of those elements and compare          exp  [[something, , somethingelse], OR, [otherelement, , 0]]         codepre

Negative 299 pIm doing the quick XAgent style view export to excel. But first I need to get a the UNID of the documents that match the criteria that I selected on my XPage. I have a button that will get the number of document found.

Theres also no scoped variable in this page. Only 2 datetime picker, a combobox, and the button itself. Any explanation for this Im confirmed the code is correct because it work in XPiNC.p  pThe total number of documents that I got is supposed to be 18. If I append .toJavaDate to from, to, and vefrom, then I get 10 documents which is wrong. Ive checked the underlying value of StartDate and EndDate for each document and each value is of TimeDate like 08122013 120000 PM ZE8. I assume that converting and any date value in my code to NotesDateTime will ensure that all have the same type and can be compared to but for this one Im totally dont know what I did wrong. p

Negative 299 pI have a situation in which I would like a method to  work within a transaction, but only if a transaction has not already been started. Heres a contrived example to distill what Im talking aboutp  precodeclass ConductBusinessLogic   def initializeparams     params  params   end    def process     ActiveRecordBase.transaction do       ModelA.createmultipleparams[modela]       ModelB.createmultipleparams[modela]     end   end end  class ModelA lt ActiveRecordBase   def self.createmultipleparams      Id like the below to be more like ensuretransaction     ActiveRecordBase.transaction do       params.each  p createp      end   end end  class ModelB lt ActiveRecordBase   def self.createmultipleparams      Again, a transaction here is only necessary if one has not already been started     ActiveRecordBase.transaction do       params.each  p createp      end   end end codepre  pBasically, I dont want these to act as nested transactions. I want the code.createmultiplecode methods to only start transactions if they are not already called within a transaction, such as through codeConductBusinessLogicprocesscode. If the model methods are called by themselves, they should start their own transaction, but if they are already being called inside a transaction, as through codeConductBusinessLogicprocesscode, they should not nest a subtransaction.p  pI dont know of a way in which Rails provides this out of the box. If I run the above code asis and a rollback is triggered by one of the model methods, the whole transaction will still go through because the subtransaction swallows the codeActiveRecordRollbackcode exception. If I use the coderequiresnewcode option on the subtransactions, savepoints will be used to simulate nested transactions, and only that subtransaction will actually be rolled back. The behavior I would like would be something to the effect of codeActiveRecordBase.ensuretransactioncode, such that a new transaction is started only if there isnt already an outer transaction, so that any subtransaction can trigger a rollback on the entire outer transaction. This would allow these methods to be transactional on their own, but defer to a parent transaction if there is one.p  pIs there a builtin way to achieve this behavior, and if not, is there a gem or patch that will workp

Negative 299 pI am working on a Java7 project, and we need a timestamp in International Atomic Time.

There seems to be old SourceForge amp GitHub pages for ThreeTen, as well as an OpenJDK page.p  pIve found the Java 7 backport, but after downloading this from Maven it doesnt include the TAIInstant class, which is what I actually need the TIAInstant class is listed on the ThreeTen SourceForge JavaDoc, under javax.time.TAIInstant.p  pFor completeness, this is the excerpt from my pom.xmlp  precodeltdependencygt   ltgroupIdgtorg.threetenltgroupIdgt   ltartifactIdgtthreetenbpltartifactIdgt   ltversiongt0.8.1ltversiongt ltdependencygt codepre  pShould I be using something else, and where should I be getting it fromp  pNote Sorry Im not able to provide links to all the pages Im referring to, StackOverflow wont let me have  2 links per post without higher rep.p  pstrong[EDIT]strong The reason for wanting TAI is that I need a timestamp which is monotonically increasing, which I believe TAI fulfils even during both positive amp negative leap seconds, since it strikedoesnt care about leap secondsstrike counts all seconds equally, including leap seconds.p  pHaving read about POSIX  Unix time from various sources its still not clear to me exactly what happens in Unix Time over a leap second. I know the Unix Time is ambiguous in terms of referring to a UTC Time, but Im not clear on what happens in Unix Time in the instant a leap second occurs Does Unix Time pause or go backwards for example And perhaps more importantly, even if it shouldnt according to the Unix Time spec, do Unix implementations actually obey the spec regarding leap seconds...p  pFinally, Am I correct in saying that System.currentTimeMillis will get the equivalent of POSIX Time albeit in milliseconds rather than secondsp  pNote, I need an object which is portable across JVMs and machines ruling out System.nanoTime or similar.p  pstrong[CONCLUSION]strongp  pstrongTAIstrongbr  TAI is a system of measuring time where every second is counted and all seconds are equal  ie. every second consists of the same period of time, and all seconds including leap seconds are counted in the total. This means the number of seconds in TAI counted from some arbitrary start point, the Unix Epoch for example is a monotonically increasing integer.p  pstrongPOSIX Timestrongbr  POSIX Time is a standard NOT an implementation for measuring time. It defines every day as having exactly 86400 seconds. Therefore, POSIX time does not count leap seconds since occasionally a minute may have 61 seconds, leading to days with 86400 seconds, and theoretically a minute could have 59 seconds, leading to days with lt86400 seconds. This means that seconds in POSIX have variable length, and shortly before  during  after leap seconds, a POSIX clock may skip seconds or repeat them. Specifically, the POSIX spec as referenced by Meno Hochschild in his answer states, The relationship between the actual time of day and the current value for seconds since the Epoch is unspecified.p  pstrongUTCstrongbr  UTC is a time standard which is related to the way the Earth moves around the Sun, aiming to maintain the relationship between the position of the Sun and the time of day within a threshold. Ie in a UTC0 region of the Earth, the Sun is always at its highest at midday UTC time. Leap Seconds positive or negative are necessary because the speed of the Earths rotation is not fixed, and it does not vary in a predictable way meaning we cannot predict when leap seconds will be necessary  or whether they will be positive leap seconds or negative leap secondsp  pstrongRepresenting Timesstrongbr  It seems to me that both TAI and POSIX are representations of counts of seconds ie. something easy for a computer to actually store, whereas UTC is a human interpretation of time ie. YearMonthDay HourMinuteSecond.millisecond that is not usually stored internally by a computer.p  pstrongTranslating Timesstrongbr  Given the above, there are a number of issues translating from POSIX without any leap seconds counted to TAI with leap seconds countedp  ol liIt requires maintaining a table  count of leap seconds to translate any POSIX Time to a TAI Timeli liEven if point 1 is addressed, the POSIX Spec as above makes no guarantee about what will happen emduringem a leap second, so at such times we have no way of accurately representing an unambiguous timeli liIf a number of systems must communicate, passing timestamps between them, we must guarantee that the table  count of leap seconds is kept consistentli ol  pOn the other hand, it is easy to convert from POSIX to the UTC human interpretation. It doesnt require knowledge of leap seconds, since it just assumes every day has the same number of seconds albeit some of these seconds have different lengths of time in reality. In practice, you would just use the inverse of the formula in the POSIX Spec to obtain various the UTC components of time again, see the POSIX spec referenced by Meno Hochschild.p

Negative 299 pfirst, Id like to state that Im new  to android development and to gradle as well. not to java. I had a project supporting 2.3.6 and Im now in the process of migrating it to 4.4 using the support library. Im using Gradle as well, and so far, its working great.p  pIm now using the navigation drawer to navigate between the apps fragments, which used to be activities. One of the fragments in the drawer holds a listview and a detail view for an item in the list. The drawer fragment switches its view when the user clicks an item in the list and shows its details.p  pWhile its pretty clear to me why its not recommended for 2 fragments to communicate directly, I still need the list fragment to tell its details fragment counterpart about the selected item. The guides specifically say that the activity should implement the callbacks and on the callback methods it should communicate the data between the fragments. However, in my case, the parent is also a fragment.  My question is should the parent fragment maintain the callbacks  It seems like the proper solution, since my fragment is only implemented this way to use the navigation drawer swap, and logically, it behaves like an activity, but this would go against the guides saying fragments should not communicate directly.p  pThe question is if implementing the callbacks in the containing fragment is a viable approach or i should change this part of the app to an activityp  pThanks, and sorry for the wall of text.p

Negative 299 pSay I have a suite of types of the form codeBooleanAttributecode, codeContinuousAttributecode, codeFiveStarAttributecode, etc. Each of these is conceptually bound to a value type e.g. codeboolcode, codedoublecode, codeintcode for the examples above. Each also inherits from a common base class codeAttributeBasecode.p  pSay I have another generic class called codeAttributeUpgradeltAttrgtcode that contains as a member an instance of codeAttrcode, where codeAttrcode inherits from codeAttributeBasecode. I would also like it to contain two instances old and new of the value type conceptually bound to codeAttrcode.p  pWith C templates, this would be trivial. In each type in the Attribute suite I would define a typedef for ValueType, and declare my members as p  precodetemplate lttypename Attrgt class AttributeUpgrade      Attr attribute      typename AttrValueType old      typename AttrValueType new ... codepre  pSo far the equivalent solution in C, or anything near it, has alluded me. Any solutions would be appreciated, even if they involve tearing apart some of the structure in the example. As it stands, I am headed towards dropping typesafety and just typing old and new as objects. Thank youp

Negative 299 pIm trying to have 2 table views on the same view. They both are within the same codeUIViewControllercode which implementes the codeUITableViewDelegatecode and codeDatasourcecode. one of the tableviews is static and the other is dynamic. The dynamic table view is loading just fine using the methods from its datasource, but the static one is showing up blank.

Negative 299 pI am creating a page that displays 4 sponsors ads on each page load from 15 different sponsors.  The ads should be weighted in how often they appear based on the value of the sponsorship.  Ive pulled off similar in php, but cant seem to get it in ASPp  pThis is how Im going about it 1. create an array of sponsors, with one column representing the value of the sponsorship 2. sum the value of the sponsorships in the array 3. use the total to create a weight percentage for each sponsor in the array, and add this percentage as an additional column in the array 4. create a new array that duplicates sponsor values based on their weightp  pIn ASP I ended up creating a 3 dimensional array that duplicates my initial Sponsors array of data based on its weight.

Negative 299 pFollowing up on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22072974howtostructurerxjscodeHow to structure rxjs codea, concerning how to structure a widget with subwidget when using rx, how would you structure rx code where the subwidgets are datadrivenp  pAs a toy problem, suppose you have an external source e.g. web service streaming a list of stocks to watch, with value, high, low, etc. So you have an Observable stream like time goes downp  precode[id csco, value 12, high 20, low 10]  [id csco, value 12, high 20, low 8,   id aapl, value 29, high 30, low 20] codepre  pYou need to build a widget for each stock symbol. So the pattern in the previous question has to be modified. Theres not one child, and a child is createddestroyed based on the input stream, e.g. we create a child for csco on the 1st event. On the 2nd event the csco child gets an update low 8 and we create a child for aapl.p  pYou could move the subwidget creation to the subscribep  precodefunction widgetstate    state  state.share   var children     state.subscribefunction s      findNewchildren, s.forEachfunction stock         children[stock]  subwidgetstate.selectfindById.bindnull, stock           ... delete old ones similarly     codepre  pThis introduces an ordering problem the child doesnt get the event that cause it to be created. You can work around this by doing something like codestate.repeat1code, or codestate.startsWiths.select...code, but it looks a bit odd.p  pSuppose the children are also returning streams. E.g. maybe the user manipulates the children to model different positions, so we want to get some computation back from the children and display an overall total, or other metric, in widget.p  pDo you create a Subject in widget and push on it the streams from the children Likep  precode   var positions  new Rx.Subject    positions.mergeAll.subscribedisplayTotal    ...       .. subscribefunctions         child  subwidget...        children[stock]  child.disposable         positions.onNextchild.position codepre  pThis all seems pretty clunky. Is there a better way to organize it I tried modeling it as a stream of streams, one per child, and merging the outputs. This worked poorly. It was hard to keep track of the inner subscriptions, or have multiple streams output from the children.p
Negative 299 pI have a table with the following structurep  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[casewaveformdata]      [caseid]                INT             NOT NULL,     [channelindex]          INT             NOT NULL,     [secondsbetweenpoints] REAL            NOT NULL,     [lasttimestamp]        DATETIME        NOT NULL,     [valuearray]            VARBINARY MAX NULL  codepre  pThis table will contain millions of records. I want to read in data by caseid and channelindex from one database then group 5 minutes worth of them together by decompressing the valuearray data and linking them together, compress that stream then add the combined chunk to another database.p  pThe code I have works fine on up about 100k records. After that I get random errors such as out of memory in system.data, CRC does not match on compresseduncompressd data, invalid character in compressed data. It will happen randomly if I go larger than 100k.p  pI was using linq to loop through the records but then switched to the SqlDataReader directly. To import the records I use the SqlBulkCopy but I have found I get the error even with that part commented out. It appears that if I write out each combined record to a file as an insert the code will complete but if I start collecting the combined records into a list that I pass over to the SqlBulkCopy for the insert I will get the ranom errors. Most of the time it is an out of memory error on the reader.Read or the foreach var record in records line when using linq. The memory on the process itself is around 80MB for working set, private and commit.p  pAny ideas on what I am doing wrong IS there a better way to accomplish this If I use the file I write out it will be up to 300MB, Can I load a file that sizep  pHere is the whole function.

Negative 299 pHow to improve codefeedback cycle on Android.p  pAs a developer doing web development, the change feedback is extremely quick. I simply make a change to my code, refresh my browser and voila I can see whether my change worked. Add to this the ability to make changes in the browser.p  pIn Android however, even if Ive made an extremely trivial change and I have to run the application again. That ends up requiring the entire compilation process, installing the app again on the usb deviceemulator and starting the app again  which is prohibitively slow and makes for unproductive development.p  pTraditional desktop apps required the compilation etc., but at least the process happened on the same machine and did not require the entire process of installing the app on the mobile deviceemulator etc.p  pI was wondering if there are any better development practices to work around this. I understand that some amount of the pain could be relieved through unit testing, but even the tests runs on the device. It just seems like an extremely slow process.p

Negative 299 pstrongBasic Questionstrong  Given an interface ICopiesFromOf In TModel where there is no type constraint on the generic argument, can that interface be implemented more than once on the same concrete type using a different type argument without a compiler warningp  pstrongBackground Infostrong My handle on covariance and contravariance has been increasing in recent years thanks to Mr. Eric Lippert, Google, and many hours of testing  experimenting.  In a project I am working on, I have a need to separate different layers of the architecture and not expose base model  entity types to a higher layer presentation.  To accomplish this, I have been creating composite classes MVC Models that contain aspects of potentially multiple different base layer model types.  I have a separate layer that will build these composite types from the base types service layer.  One important requirement is that the base types not be passed up via a reference, so properties must be duplicated in order to create a deepcopy of the base model class.p  pTo remove some of the lengthy and ugly code from the service layer, I created an interface that defines a common contract for composite types that allows for the property values to be copied in the composite object.  When I want to implement this interface multiple times however, the VB compiler generates a warning.  The program runs just fine, but I want to understanding the specifics of why this is happening.  Particularly, if this is a fragile or poor design decision, I want to know now before I get too deep.p  pEnvironment Detailsp  ul listrongLanguagestrong VB.Netli listrong.NETstrong 4.0li listrongIDEstrong VS2010 SP1li listrongUsagestrong Website MVC2li ul  pIn attempting to figure this out, I have done some reasearch on SO and the internet but nothing really addresses my question specifically.

Negative 299 pIs there a library that I can use to unzip a password protected file Site makes me put a password on the file when downloading it There are a ton of libraries to unzip normal files, but none that I can find that will do it with a password. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14829782generateapasswordprotectedzipfileinnodejsHerea I found some helpful starters. But I would rather not resort to using codechildprocesscode and using built in unix unzipping functionality, but that may be my last resort. I would even be up to preforming my own manipulation on the encrypted code, but Im unable to even find out how to determine the encryption type it seems to just be very standard, since i can do it in the terminal. p  pAgain I would rather not do this, but Im afraid it is my only option so I have tried the followingp  precodevar fs  requirefs , unzip  requireunzip , spawn  requirechildprocess.spawn , expand  functionfilepath, cb       var self  this      , unzipStream  fs.createReadStreamfilepath.pipeunzip.Parse      , xmlData         unzipStream.onentry, function entry              var filename  entry.path             first zip contains files and one password protected zipfile.              Here I can just do pipeunzip.Parse again, but then i just get a giant encoded string that I dont know how to handle, so i tried other things bellow.            iffilename.match.zip                  entry.ondata, function data                       var funzip  spawnfunzip,P,ThisIsATestPsswd,                      var newFile  funzip.stdin.writedata               more closing code... codepre  pThen I sort of lost what to do.

I cant figure out what to do next to get this new unzipped file into either a working file, or a readable string. p  pI am super new to codeNodecode and all the asynclisteners being fired by other processes is a little confusing still, so Im sorry if any of this makes no sense.

Negative 299 pTo make a highly scalable and highly available website I am considering authenticating user using no database calls. Here is how I imagine it could be done.

Can you review this procedure and let me know if you find any hole, issues or advice.p  ol liWhen a user registers with an email  password combination, create codehashemail amp passwordcode. For example the hash could be code5541c7b5a06c39b267a5efae6628e003code.li licreate a url on the server codehttpnodbauth.com5541c7b5a06c39b267a5efae6628e003code which returns xml content.li liThe javascript client includes a crypto library such as a hrefhttpscode.google.compcryptojs relnofollowhttpscode.google.compcryptojsa.li liThe javascript client prompts for email  password, calculates the hash and http get the codehttpnodbauth.com5541c7b5a06c39b267a5efae6628e003code url. Only the user is able to calculate this hash, because only the user knowns the password  email combination required to do so. So this url should only be known by the user. These urls are not published.li liThe contain of the url is an xml file containing private user information. The xml file is always encrypted using aes256 and decrypted by the javascript client.li ol  pPROSp  pNo databases are required to authenticate the user.p  pThe xml file can be pushed using cloudfront to users worldwide, resulting very fast responses.p  pThe xml file can be duplicated accross many servers, making the system very scalable.p  pThe system does not need downtime.p  pCONSp  pWhen the user saves a change to his private information name, email or password, a new file has to be created and distributed on the cloudfront network which might take a few seconds.

Negative 299 pC does not support virtual template methods. The reason is that this would alter the codevtablecode whenever a new instantiation of such a method is made it has to be added to the codevtablecode.p  pJava in contrast does allow virtual generic methods. Here, it is also clear how this can be implemented Java generics are erased at runtime, so a generic method is a usual method at runtime, so no alterations of the codevtablecode necessary.p  pBut now to C. C does have reified generics. With reified generics and especially when using value types as type parameters, there have to be different versions of a generic method. But then we have the same problem as C has We would need to alter the vtable whenever a new instantiation of a generic method was made.p  pI am not too deep into the inner workings of C, so my intuition could simply be totally wrong.

Negative 299 pI have this method in my project. This is what it is supposed to do br It accepts a string which is the name of a file in a folder, AV, in the Assets folder of my project. It opens this file and performs some operations on it not all of the required operations are in the code, yet.p  precode    public async static TaskltBookgt ParseFilestring bookN              string bookName  bookN.Replace ,           StorageFile bookFile  await StorageFile.GetFileFromApplicationUriAsyncnew UrimsappxAssetsAV  bookName  .txt         string content  await FileIO.ReadTextAsyncbookFile          string chapterStr  CHAPTER          int numOfChapters  Utilities.NumOfTimesStringOccurscontent, chapterStr          Book book  new BookbookName, numOfChapters         book.Chapters  new ListltChaptergtnumOfChapters          return book      codepre  pThe problem is this linep  precode    string content  await FileIO.ReadTextAsyncbookFile codepre  pI know this because I set a breakpoint at the first line of the method. After stepping into the code, that particular line broke and opened the code.g.cscode file and was highlighting a line that apparently implied the compiler could not trace it. The line had to do with codediagnostics.debuggercode or something like that.p  pThe next step I tried was to put in a codetrycode and display the error in a codeMessageDialogcode. The error from this wasp  precode    Object reference was not found codepre  por something similar.   p  pI am thinking it could be that the linep  precode    StorageFile bookFile  await StorageFile.GetFileFromApplicationUriAsyncnew UrimsappxAssetsAV  bookName  .txt codepre  pis causing this since it has codeawaitcode so maybe the operation was not complete before the next line could be executed. But I dont expect it to be slow since the files in the folder are just 5  6 kB each on average.p  pI dont know whats wrong as this is my first time of using the codeStoragecode namespace classes as Im new to Windows Store programming.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAfter going through this a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumswindowsappsenUS34fa33d236fc477485eed617f03a99fcreadtextfilefromfileopenpickervbforumwinappswithcsharp relnofollowMSDN Foruma, I changed the code to thisp  precode    StorageFile bookFile  await StorageFile.GetFileFromApplicationUriAsyncnew UrimsappxAssetsAV  bookName  .txt     Windows.Storage.Streams.IRandomAccessStream ras  await bookFile.OpenReadAsync     Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReader reader  new Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReaderras.GetInputStreamAt0     int numOfBytes  intras.Size     Byte[] bytes  new Byte[numOfBytes  1]     await reader.LoadAsyncuintnumOfBytes     reader.ReadBytesbytes     string content  Convert.ToBase64Stringbytes codepre  pThis code should have actually worked because when I stepped through it during breakpoint, there was no error. But for some reason I cant fathom, the app doesnt react. When I set a breakpoint and I step into the code, it works I mean it doesnt break it does not give me the expected output but when there is none, it freezes.p  pI initially thought it was the size of the file 201 kB that was taking too long so I changed it to another with a much lesser size 3 kb but it was the same. Now Im thinking it has to do with codeasynccode and codeawaitcode. I wish there was a way to do this without using them.p  pEDITbr Im not posting this an answer because I realized the it solved the issue but the question did not contain enough info to get an answer.p  pThe solution was that I didnt use codeawaitcode on the method that was calling this method. I would have deleted it but I thought maybe it could be help someone. Thanks to everyone that attempted to solve it.p

Negative 299 pstrongWhy is it that a codencode only creates an actual new line inside a codecontenteditablecode with codewhitespace precode, if there is something following the codencodestrongp  pstronga hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettQ4hL2 relnofollowFiddleastrongp  pVarious examples in the fiddle. The first codecontenteditablecode has a text node inside with a single codencode character. My expectation would be that this creates two lines inside the codedivcode, since the codencode character should begin a new line, even if there is nothing on that new line. This is more so confirmed by the fact that a container with nothing at all inside looks exactly the same as a container with a single new line.p  pThe next two boxes also both have a single codencode, but both are followed by either text or codercode, so a new line is created. The example with codenrcode is the only one which produces logical behavior for me, as there is no text in the box, but there is still one extra line created by the codencode.p  pOverall, it looks to me as if the usage of codencode always produces one less new line than I would expect. When inspecting the element with Chromes inspector, you can see that the closing codeltdivgtcode is pushed to the next line  so why is there no new line in the codecontenteditablecodep  pstrongBackground information, if relevantstrongp  pI am building a codecontenteditablecode input field similar to Twitters tweet publish input which highlights characters that go over the limit.p  pOne of the issues to tackle is line break behavior and in order to make it crossbrowser compatible including IE8, I have decided that the most appropriate solution in my case is to codepreventDefaultcode event on pressing the codeRETURNcode key, and manually add an codencode instead of letting the browser add a random HTML tag. In order for these codencodes to be visible, my codecontenteditablecode div is styled with codewhitespace precode. p  pThis technique also requires manually moving the caret one position forward, which is where my issue with codencode not showing up as a visible character comes from. I can add a codercode after the codencode to ensure a visible line break appears, but this messes up my character count.p

Negative 299 pI have a quite large Java object that represents a graph, with vertices and edges, in memory. Each vertex has an codeArrayListcode of other vertices that it is connected to and has a codeHashMapcode data structure as well for other purposes. The graph can have a few thousand vertices, and many more edges.p  pWhen trying to serialize the graph using Javas builtin serialization codeimplements Serializablecode, etc., I always run into a codeStackOverflowErrorcode. Setting other attributes of the graph to codetransientcode does not help, and nor does setting the stack size to be larger i.e. codeXss1gcode or codeXss512mcode.p  pI would not think that I need to make a custom codewriteObjectcode method since codeArrayListcode and codeHashMapcode already have their own implementations, which are called upon serialization.p  pMy question is is there a way to serialize a large Java object already in memory without getting a codeStackOverflowErrorcodep  pstrongEditstrong Here is the stack tracep  precodeException in thread main java.lang.StackOverflowError

Negative 299 pIm using WebMatrix with jQuery Mobile to develop a simple mobile web page that involves some database operations.

Negative 299 pI hit a compatibility issues with Oracle Weblogic and an SSL certificate which uses wildcard DNS names in in the Subject Alternate Names SAN extension.

Negative 299 pIm trying to extract step data from HealthKit.p  pI want to create a summary of step data grouped by hour. Currently, I can extract all of the samples of data between a date range provided by codeNSPredicatecode with codeHKSampleQuerycode.

Negative 299 pIm working on a project where I am using an Arduino Uno to transmit audio via bluetooth to an Android device and then play it on the device.

Negative 299 pA simple as that where can I find the API documentation for the String type in Swift Does something like that exist at all It really should for such a fundamental type. But not even Google returns anything useful.p  pYou can get the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationSwiftConceptualSwiftProgrammingLanguageStringsAndCharacters.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40014097CH7 relnofollowStrings and Charactersa page, which is however a general overview about String handling. Or you can read the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationGeneralReferenceSwiftStandardLibraryReferenceindex.html relnofollowStringa page which is terrible. Theres only a handful stuff mentioned some init, very few functions and some operators.p  pLooking in the source code for String theres a lot more, but only with marginal description and complex structure as the actual APIs are split over a dozen extensions.p  pTo make it clear Im looking for the Swift String equivalence of the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceFoundationClassesNSStringClassindex.html relnofollowNSString Class Referencea.p

Negative 299 pCurrently I am developing a c low pass filter in real time using directsound API. The problem that Ive encountered is that various implementations of low pass filters seem not to work with my echo implementation. At the begining of the filtering I have an array of bytes read that is read from the capturing buffer. The values of this array are between 0 and 255.p  pWhen I subject the array to lowpass filtering algorithm I obtain values that fall between 0 and 1 and as an effect the play array is silent zeros only. I attach the relevant code.p  pI imagine that that this approach is wrong and probably the input data should look different as the low pass algorithm seems to kill it completely. Any ideas Thanks in advance.p  pstrongUpdated relevant code after KillaKems commentsstrongp  precodebuffer format var format  new WaveFormat                      SamplesPerSecond  44100,

Negative 299 pIn a bigger project I am experiencing a strange behavior at least for my understanding with static field initialization.

In the real project, I am doing exactly this although foo and bar. are in different classes, but bar. is NOT invoked before I actually use the value of foo. At least this happens in one case out of five  which are all created in the same way as shown above. The other four work fine. Are there any circumstances which would cause Java behaving like thisp  pI already looked at these discussions, but they do not seem to capture my problemp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8704423whenstaticvariablesareinitializedinjavawhen static variables are initialized in Javaabr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2547713whystaticfieldsarenotinitializedintimeWhy static fields are not initialized in timeabr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11631216javastaticfieldinitializationJava Static Field Initializationap  pI realize that, when swapping the positions of foo and collection, the method invokation cannot work because collection would not be initialized or rather, initialized to null when foo gets initialized. To be honest, I am not sure in which order static fields are initialized when located in different classes, so this might be a source of problems. But this would result in a p  precodeException in thread main java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError codepre  pand not in just not invoking bar..p  pIf required, I can provide more details about the real project, but so far I dont know what else might be of interest.

Negative 299 pIs it possible to have an unidirectional manytomany mapping in hibernate, so that duplicates of the child does not get saved Im using XML mapping and not the annotations, because thats what I happened to start with.p  pI have only found this one as a potential solution, but Id like to know if hibernate can be configured without coding a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25994043hibernatecascademanytomanycreatesduplicatesinchildreferenceHibernate cascade many to many creates duplicates in child referenceap  pIn my case I unmarshall XML with jaxb to get java objects, and I dont need bidirectional mapping.p  pI have a class ArticleItem, that has a Set of Category, and the Category class has no reference back to Article. What Id like to do is save the article object, and only insert categories into the Category table if they do no yet exist. The way categories are linked to Articles are by a linking table.p  pThe reason I want to get it to work without coding is that I wanted to learn something new hibernate. Perhaps I have the wrong perception of Hibernate, I thought it can figure out what it need to do if I configure it right. So far Ive spent almost one day learning hibernate and it does not feel very productive considering I could just have designed the db tables myself and done the code for insertingupdating correctly in an hour.p  pHere is an example that is similar to mine, where they save 2 students, both having the same courses. Still, the courses are saved only once in the course table a hrefhttpwww.dzone.comtutorialsjavahibernatehibernateexamplehibernatemappingmanytomanyusingannotations1.html relnofollowhttpwww.dzone.comtutorialsjavahibernatehibernateexamplehibernatemappingmanytomanyusingannotations1.htmlap  pHeres one more example, but it is bidirectional and I cant make the inverse mapping in the same way since the Category does not have a reference back to Article a hrefhttpviralpatel.netblogshibernatemanytomanyxmlmappingexample relnofollowhttpviralpatel.netblogshibernatemanytomanyxmlmappingexamplea Viral Patel has really good tutorials by the wayp  precodeArticle has properties String Title SetltCategorygt categories  Category has property String category codepre  pIn the ItemArticle mapping I have this so farp  precodeltset namecategories cascadesaveupdate tableItemCategorygt     ltkey columnitemIDgt    ltmanytomany columncategoryID classCategorygt ltsetgt    codepre  pIt almost works as I want it to, only it does save same categories multiple times in the Category table and that seems unnecessary.p  pI mostly want to use Hibernate for just avoiding designing the tables and easily dump my RSS objects into a structured format like a nosql database.p  pstrongUpdatestrong The duplicates comes from when other Items Articles are added that have the same categories that already exist in the Category table. E.g. the first Item has the categories Economy and Politics the second article has Economyp  pWhen the second article Item is saved Id like hibernate to add an entry in the joining table to the existing Economy row and not create a new one.p  pI already tried making the category unique but then I get sql errors from hibernate that the index already contains the key.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong I changed the Item class to have a set of strings instead of categories. The mapping now looks likep  precodeltset namecategories tableCategorygt     ltkey columnitemIDgt     ltelement columncategory typestringgt ltsetgt   codepre  pThis removes the joining table I desired for avoiding data duplication. Now categories or tags appear in the category table as many times they have occurred in all Items articles.p  pThe whole idea was to reduce the data in the database when storing 1000s of items. The same categories or tags are mostly used, so if a joining table could be used in such way that the Category table would only contain unique categories, then a lot of redundancy could be removed.p  pstrongUpdate 3strong  My problem seems similar to this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2857490usingsaveorupdateinhibernatecreatesnewrecordsinsteadofupdatingexistiUsing saveOrUpdate in Hibernate creates new records instead of updating existing onesap  pstrongUpdate 4strong I switched back to having a set of categories in the Item class, to test if it works by having Category.category as key.

Negative 299 pIve been searching all over for this and Im surprised I havent found it yet.p  pIm using Windows 7. Ive got TortoiseSVN 1.8 with command line tools available but if there is a solution using another client that will work, Im open to other options.p  pIm trying to reset the cached auths for a specific repository on an svn client.p  pIve have a group of projects 15 that get built all together.  We have setup batch files using the svn command line client to checkout and build the projects which work great on the individual developers machine since the svn client caches their credentials.p  pHowever, we are setting up a central build machine for releases instead of having one person responsible for release builds and we would like for anyone to be able to login and run a build using their own credentials.p  pThe problem we have is that if we leave the svn client using its default settings, then anyone logging into the machine will use the previous persons credentials.  If we switch the svn client to not cache credentials, then the build process its all scripted remember has to prompt for every project which results in the user typing their password 15 times just to do a build.p  pWe are part of a large company and our svn server houses a lot of different repos for other teams and some developers use multiple repos so I cannot simply clear the cache directory after the build because that would wipe out all cached repos instead of just ours as far as I can tell, svn only caches by server, not by repo.p  pIs there any solution I can implement that will prompt for svn credentials on the first project that gets pulled from svn in the batch file, uses those credentials for all projects in the script but then clears the cached credentials for only those projects or the whole repo when the script finishesp  pIve tried several different method to try and reset the credentials for a specific project but I am not having any luck.  Even if my script has to go reset them individually, that would be ok.p  pSomeone on another so thread suggested using svn switch on the project and providing a different user via username when done but that doesnt seem to work on windows they were using OSX.

Hope Im clear enough.p  pIm 12 years old, learning coding myself and jQuery amp JS is pretty confusing to me, so I try to keep it as simple as possible.p  pSituation I am using a simple JS function that takes an URL from local FTP server, checks whether the URL has any parameters example.phpabc..., inserts included1 behind the URL to prevent it to be opened unless called by this function and puts the files contents into an empty DIV using .load and also uses .load to display a loading page.p  pProblem is, it works perfectly, but every two minutes or so, it gets stuck on my loading screen and I have to either run the function again or reload the whole thing. I have no idea whats wrong.p  pFunctionp  precodevar loadPage  functionurl     contentLoad.loadloading.php  ifurl.indexOfgt0     contentLoad.loadurl  ampincluded1  else      contentLoad.loadurl  included1  window.history.replaceStateObject, Title, url  codepre  pThen, when I want to have an codeltagtcode that opens the page explore.php, for example, I usep  pcodeltligtlta href onclickloadPageexplore.phpgtExploreltagtltligtcode.p  pAnyone see what I can be doing wrong Im pretty sure its something dead simple Im missing.p  pThank you a lotp
Negative 299 pIs there any official documentation for the SignalR protocol If I wanted to develop my own client, where would look for reference material I know there are .NET, JS and Java clients available, but I need a PHP one. And I need it to run serverside, not just in a browser in a PHPgenerated page.p  pI tried the a hrefhttpsgithub.comSignalRSignalRwikiProtocol relnofollowGitHub wikia, the a hrefhttpwww.asp.netsignalroverviewapireference relnofollowASP.NET sitea, and MSDN, to no avail.p  pI could use the JS client in a Node process and have it proxy things for my PHP app, but that seems silly. Id rather invest in a proper client implementation.p

Negative 299 pI am trying to show a ViewController directly from its sibling window, the tree looks kinds like this CalibrationVClt MainVC  Settings VC. The MainVC presents the other two modally, and over current context. Now what I want to do is click a button in SettingsVC, that would open the CalibrationVC for a specific device. I have managed to do so using unwind segues and a delegate from the SettingsVC, and it looks like thisp  precode voidshowViewForDeviceCalibration      [self performSegueWithIdentifiershowCalibrationViewFromSettings sendernil]   void prepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue senderidsender      if [segue.identifier isEqualToStringshowCalibrationViewFromSettings]              [delegate calibrateDevicedeviceToConfigure]       codepre  pThe delegate implementationp  precodevoidcalibrateDeviceDevice device      dispatchblockt autoinitService               deviceToCalibrateFromSettings  device         [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval0.2]         dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,              [self performSegueWithIdentifiershowCalibrationViewForDeviceFromSettings sendernil]                     dispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueQOSCLASSUTILITY, 0, autoinitService  codepre  pAnd the prepare for segue methodp  precode voidprepareForSegue UIStoryboardSegue segue senderid sender     if [segue.identifier isEqualToStringshowCalibrationViewForDeviceFromSettings]              CalibrationViewController destinationController  CalibrationViewControllersegue.destinationViewController         NSArray devicesToCalibrate  [NSArray arrayWithObjectdeviceToCalibrateFromSettings]         [destinationController setDevicesToCalibrate devicesToCalibrate]  codepre  pThis works well, but is there a better way to do that I am really concerned about the delegate implementation because it uses a separate thread only to wait for a moment and then use the main thread again. I had to do this because without it the CalibrationVC would not appear saying that the MainVC is already presenting. So to sum thing up, is there a better, more optimalproper way to do thisp

Negative 299 pI would like to filter a long list of master data Stammdaten in 6 columns in arbitrary order, until the most relevant row can be identified.

It would be more userfriendly if he could select the relevant row from the remaining list of rows by ticking a checkbox, and could transfer the selected row to the historydatabase on click.

Negative 299 pI have a pair RDD with millions of keyvalue pairs, where every value is a list which may contain a single element or billions of elements.

The key is not touched, and the operation compares every element in the list to the rest of the list, which takes a huge amount of time but unfortunately it has to be done. This means that the WHOLE list needs to be in the same node at the same time. The resulting RDD will contain a sublist depending on a value calculated in the codeflatMapcode.p  pI cannot use broadcast variables in this case scenario, as no common data will be used between the different keyvalue pairs.

Negative 299 pDoes the segment registers hold the physical address that is used as a base address or because the segments can start only on a paragraph boundary, the segment register only hold the ordinal number of the that paragraph boundary and then when multiplied by 10H the final physical base address is formed and then the offset is added.

Negative 299 pIm currently experimenting with setting up a site on WAMP server to hold some personal information. Because my ISP blocks port 80, Ive had to change apaches default port from 80 to 25565 I believe that Ive also left port 80 operable just in case, though. All of this has gone well, as I am completely able to access my server by typing in localhost or localhost25565 into google chrome.p  pHowever, when using my external IP address, I get a variety of errors, namely connection timed out. In general my queries are made in the format xxx.xx.xx.x25565 or xxx.xx.xx.x, substituting my own external IP. The port is completely forwarded Ive checked a hrefhttpcanyouseeme.org relnofollowhttpcanyouseeme.orga several times and as I mentioned, the site is working correctly from the localhost.p  pI am running the latest version of wordpress on the site and using the wordpress homepage as my index.php replacing the WAMP default. I am also attaching segments of httpdvhosts.conf and httpd.conf which I modified from WAMP defaults in case those are a part of my issue. Thanks in advance.p  pUpdate I was able to discover that this is actually still a problem with port 80. Apparently the server was still trying to send the final data over port 80 even though it was responding to the initial request on port 25565.

Negative 299 pIm doing a project on web scraping using ArrayLists. When I scrape the info, it comes back as codeitem [0]  pencilcode, codeitem [1]  1.50code.  I would like these items to be together, or if possible it would be even better if the prices and item each had their own id, but each was somehow linked together so that I could reference each one separately.  Also, sometimes when scraping I get codeitem [2]  papercode, codeitem [3]  5.00code, codeitem [4]  wide bound college ruledcode, where codeitem [4]code represents an optional description that was included with the item that would need to be included in the ArrayList or in a separate ArrayList linked by ids as before. Any ideas are appreciated. p

Negative 299 pIm trying to recreate a single player version of a dice game called Dudo. The most relevant information is that six players have six hidden dice, and the point of the game is to guess how many of a certain kind of die are on the table in total e.g. If there are ten 4s, or twelve 5s etc.p  pTo make some AI, Im using binomial distributions where the computer guesses the probability of there being a certain number of a certain kind of die, based on how many of that kind of die it already has in its hand. I saved this equation in the variable chancep  precodechance  13  i  playerdicetype[turn][activetype]  23  totalcount  i  playercount[turn]  playerdicetype[turn][activetype] codepre  pcodeicode is the number of that kind of die e.g. six 5s, or seven 5s, or eight 5s etc.. I have a list of how many of each kind of die a player has codeplayerdicetypecode and I can select a specific die for a specific player by subsetting codeturncode and codeactivetypecode. The 13 has to do with the rules of the game normally itd be 16 for dice, but that doesnt have to do with my issue anyway.p  pWhen I call chance, it ONLY gives me the value for if codeplayerdicetype[turn][activetype]  0code, and codei  6code, so the probability that 6 of that die are on the table when the computer has 0 of it.p  pI can call codeicode and codeplayerdicetype[turn][activetype]code and see that they do NOT equal 6 or 0. The thing is though, if I copy and paste the equation, it works perfectly fine. It only defaults to 6 and 0 when I call chance.p  pIve also tried making a codechancefunicode function that returns the original equation, and then said codechance  chancefunicode. I can change i in the environment to whatever I want and codechancefunicode will react accordingly, but once again, the variable codechancecode does not.p  pIve included scoping as a tag just because I think it might somehow be related but I cant think of how. Ive also tried change the variable name from codechancecode to a bunch of other things and still no luck.p

Negative 299 pI have a corpus of text strongwith each linestrong in the csv file stronguniquely specifying a topicstrong I am interested in.  If I were to run an topic model on this corpus using an LDA or Gibbs method from either the topicmodels package or lda, as expected I would get multiple topics per document a line of text in my CSV which I have apriori defined to be my unique topic of interest.  I get that this is a result of the topic models algorithm and the bag of words assumption.p  pWhat I am curious about however is thisp  p1 Is there a prefabd package in R that is designed for the user to specify the topics using the empirical word distribution That is, I dont want the topics to be estimated I want to tell R what the topics are.  I suppose I could run a topic model with the correct number of Topics, use that structure of the object and then overwrite its contents.  I was just hoping there was an easier or more obvious way that Im just not seeing at this point.p  pThoughtsp  pedit added   I just thought about the alpha and beta parameters having control over the topicterm distributions within the LDA modeling algorithm.  What settings might I be able to use that would force the model to only find 1 topic per document  Or is there a setting which would allow for that to occurp  pIf these seem like silly questions I understand  Im quite new to this particular field and I am finding it fascinating.p

Negative 299 pI am working on a solution that has a set up like this We have assembly A which performs some functions, and assembly B which is purely domain models that are used by assembly A and other assemblies.

Negative 299 pBackground I was asked to create a middle man web service for a program written in Visual Fox ProVFP as VFP is not able to communicate over HTTPS, only HTTP. This VFP program must communicate with a different web service, so my web service must just edit the XML file to be HTTPS compliant.p  pI have never worked with web services before this, but have written a few basic web services to learn about them. I now need to understand what I have to do to the regular XML file to make it compliant with HTTPS and not just HTTP.

Negative 299 pIm asking this question because the answer I received in this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31728420howdoiinitializetwoinstancesofnsobjectinthesameviewcontrollerswiftHow Do I Initialize Two Instances of NSObject in the same ViewController  Swiftap  pbrought me in this direction. Whether I subclass as NSObject or UIViewController, I still receive the unrecognized selector when I change my code to whats below.p  pIm still trying to be able to create a left and right SideBar. However, I cannot even get one SideBar to load now. I receive an error [UIViewController Center] unrecognized selector sent to instance xxxxx. p  pThis question is different from the other unrecognized selector instance questions Ive seen because Im not dealing with a button and have no outlets since everything is done programmatically. Hence, I cant specify a subclass that links to a codeUIViewControllercode in the storyboard.p  pI feel like once I solve the selector issue the code will work. As the code is right now, the application compiles fine. The problem is the runtime error that I receive. I can provide information from the debugger if its necessary.p  pFwiw, it seems like the runtime is recognizing that I have a center, left, and right viewcontroller from the error message.p  pI havent included the RightSideBar code because I think if the left SideBar runs the RightSideBar will run when I add the solution. I want to keep the code you have to read through as brief as possible.p  pLast thing to note, Im reaching all of my print statements. I actually print through to the point where it says I should be showing the sideBar.p  pHere is the code for the SideBarp  precodeoptional delegate methods that select when the sidebar opens and closes. objc protocol SideBarDelegate  class   func sideBarDidSelectButtonAtIndex itemIndex Int optional func sideBarWillClose optional func sideBarWillOpen    this class sets up the actual sidebar. class SideBar UIViewController, SidebarTableViewControllerDelegate    width of the bar, tableview setup, and views for the sidebar let barWidthCGFloat  175.0 let sideBarTableViewTopInsetCGFloat  25.0 let sideBarContainerViewUIViewController  UIViewController let sideBarTableViewControllerSidebarTableViewController  SidebarTableViewController var originViewUIViewController  var for dynamic effect and controlling the sidebar var animatorUIDynamicAnimator weak var delegateSideBarDelegate var isSideBarOpenBool  false  initializer for the SideBar class. required initcoder aDecoder NSCoder      super.initcoder aDecoder   override initnibName NibNameOrNilString, bundle nibBundleOrNilNSBundle      super.initnibName nil, bundle nil    convenience init     self.initnibName nil, bundle nil   initializer for the tableView of menu items. initsourceView UIViewController, menuItems ArrayltStringgt, menuImages [UIImage]      self.originView  sourceView     self.sideBarTableViewController.tableData  menuItems     self.sideBarTableViewController.imageData  menuImages      printlnset initialization values     super.initnibName nil, bundle nil      initializing the views and animation for the menu.     setupSideBar     animator  UIDynamicAnimatorreferenceView originView.view      printlnfinished initialization      swipe gesture recognition for opening the menu.     let showGestureRecognizerUISwipeGestureRecognizer  UISwipeGestureRecognizertarget self, action handleSwipe     showGestureRecognizer.direction  UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirection.Right     originView.view.addGestureRecognizershowGestureRecognizer      let hideGestureRecognizerUISwipeGestureRecognizer  UISwipeGestureRecognizertarget self, action handleSwipe     hideGestureRecognizer.direction  UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirection.Left     originView.view.addGestureRecognizerhideGestureRecognizer   override func viewDidLoad       printlnview loaded     this function handles the direction of swipes func handleSwiperecognizer UISwipeGestureRecognizer     if recognizer.direction  UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirection.Left          showSideBarfalse         delegate.sideBarWillClose         printlnclosed the sideBar      else          printlnopened the sideBar         showSideBartrue         delegate.sideBarWillOpen        function for setting up the sidebar. func setupSideBar        printlnsetup sideBar      setting up the frameoutline of the side bar.      sideBarContainerView.view.frame  CGRectMakebarWidth  1, originView.view.frame.origin.y, barWidth, originView.view.frame.size.height      setting up the color of the sidebar.     sideBarContainerView.view.backgroundColor  UIColor.clearColor      disables subviews from being confined to the sidebar.     sideBarContainerView.view.clipsToBounds  false      placing the sidebar in the UIView     originView.view.addSubviewsideBarContainerView.view      adding blur to the menu.     let blurViewUIVisualEffectView  UIVisualEffectVieweffect UIBlurEffectstyle UIBlurEffectStyle.Light     blurView.frame  sideBarContainerView.view.bounds     sideBarContainerView.view.addSubviewblurView       setting up controls for the sidebar     sideBarTableViewController.delegate  self     sideBarTableViewController.tableView.frame  sideBarContainerView.view.bounds     sideBarTableViewController.tableView.clipsToBounds  false      disabling the scroll feature.

The image that I take in is a fairly big image, So, I have specified the codeandroidlargeHeaptruecode in my Manifest file. p  pSpecial Notep  pI am testing this on the Nexus 6 V22, which works fine, But this only happens in the Samsung S5V21. Since the rotation is not identified in the captured Image I have to manually rotate the image, That is what I am trying to do here.But I am out of luck.p

Negative 299 pBasically Im trying to show an animation on certain elements that were affected in a most recent action. After this animation completes it shouldnt play again.

When the element is deselected the original animation plays again, even if the codeanimationiterationcountcode of 1 has been reached.

Negative 299 pIm using a particle emitter in an iPad project not using SpriteKit, the particle emitter is generated inside a UIImageView and since iOS 9 this emitter is making the whole app crash. Actually, the whole iPad is crashing, the image freezes and nothing can make the iPad unfreeze short of restarting the iPad. p  pIf I bring the birthrate down from 19.0f to 6.0f the iPad stops crashing.  The image I am using is a png of 256256 in size, Im not sure if that might play a role in it crashing. p  pEverything was working fine in iOS 8. p  pIm currently on iOS 9.0.1 on an iPad Air 2, using Xcode 7.0.1. p  pAnyone else has experienced this issue Any advice would be appreciated.

Negative 299 pEDIT how is this question different from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22637900java8lambdasvsanonymousclassesJava8 Lambdas vs Anonymous classesa The answers provided in the previous question are regarding of how they work in a higher level. I already understand the syntax benefits. My question here is regarding the facts, that anonymous classes are ultimately obejct isntances, and lambdas strongare not objectsstrong. I want to understand the differences and implications under the hood of this mechanism and how does it work.p  pSo, the first notable difference is naturally in the syntax. The second is that as far as I udnerstand, lambdas may only be implemented as FunctionalInterfaces which requires that the interface we are implementing have only one method, which allows better inference.p  pPremise as I understand a functional interface has a nonobject method a hrefhttpcr.openjdk.java.netbriangoetzlambdalambdatranslation.html relnofollowsource hereap  pMy question is, exactly how do they differ under the hood, by this I mean, if how are they difference in a sense that anonymous classes are instanciated, they ultimately objects, but lambdas.. are not This is what I dont fully understand, are lambdas not really instances of objects What are the real differences of lambdas not being objects in comparison to an anonymous classp
