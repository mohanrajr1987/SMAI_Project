Positive 1249 pIs there a place I can find a PPA for memcached on Ubuntu trusty Usually the maintainers have a PPA but I cannot locate one. If not, Im sure it could be built manually but I was curious if anyone else was able to solve this problem. Thanksp
Positive 1249 pUsing memcached, I understand howwhy using a small maximum size for entries is great for performance.  The default value as of this writing is 1 MB, although it allows for up to 128MB with a warning.p  pMy issue is, we occasionally have entries that are 1.5 MB in size.  What happens if we attempt to load an entry that exceeds our maximum configured size I suspect it simply bypasses the cache and logs a warning but I am not certain.p  pAdditionally, can anyone see any glaring flaws to deliberately setting the maximum size below a known but rare event of encountering an entry greater than that maximum size, in order to get more efficient use of the memcached slabsp

Positive 1249 pIm a Memcached beginner.p  pIn my application is possibile that some memcahed items are created and never deleted.p  pIm trying to figure out if it would be somehow better to always put an expiration time while creating new items.p  pThe official wiki saysp  blockquote   pstrongWhen Are Items Evictedstrongbr   Items are evicted if they have not expired an expiration time of 0 or some time in the future, the slab class is completely out of free chunks, and there are no free pages to assign to a slab class.p      pstrongHow the LRU Decides What to Evictstrongbr   Memory is also reclaimed when its time to store a new item. If there are no free chunks, and no free pages in the appropriate slab class, memcached will look at the end of the LRU for an item to reclaim. It will search the last few items in the tail for one which has already been expired, and is thus free for reuse. If it cannot find an expired item however, it will evict one which has not yet expired. This is then noted in several statistical counters.p      pa hrefhttpscode.google.compmemcachedwikiNewUserInternals relnofollowhttpscode.google.compmemcachedwikiNewUserInternalsap blockquote  pTo me this means that if some items are a abandoned without an expiration time, memcached will automatically reuse them if memory is needed.p  pSo, is there any advange to always set an expiration timep

Positive 1249 pI am refactoring somone elses code. One thing i have noticed is that memcache seems to just cache every request made whenever its made.p  pExample we have a  getUserscity,state,country function, in which it gets all users. Right now we look for a memcache store with the exact params, then we lookup the DB, store to memcache. So if the results were 300 people, we would put that whole dataset into memcache. If any user changes, we dont know which possible memcache stores they are in, so we must dump them all.p  pI was thinking it would be better to have a getUserid which stores to memcache with a longer timer. On update, it updates the memcache for userid.p  pthen instead getUserscity,state,country instead would get ids, and foreach getUserid from memcache. We can still memcache the result of the ids, so commonly looked at queries are stored. p  pIs this theoretically the right direction or is it just better to memcache last requestp

Positive 1249 pQuestion here about caching data from calls to an external ReST API. p  pThere is currently a ReST service set up to generate and retrieve some specific types of reports that the UI must consume. However, this service is not meant for high volume usage, or to be exposed to the public and these reports are fairly static. Possibly only changing every 1020 minutes. The web application resides on a separate server. p  pWhat I would like to do is, using memcached or Redis, is when a request for data comes in from the UI to the web backend, make a call from the web application backend to the report server to get the specified report, transform the data to the appropriate format for the UI to consume, cache it with a timestamp, and return it to the UI so subsequent requests will be available in memory on the web applications backend without having to rerequest from the report server. I would also need to check this timestamp and make a new request if the cached report has been held for longer than the specified time. The data that will be cached is fairly minuscule just some smallish JSON objects with only a handful of values holding the information the UI needs and there is NOT a ton of these objects, I would not be surprised if they could all be easily stored in memory at once so the time stamping is the only invalidation that should be necessary.p  pI have almost 0 experience here when it comes to caching  memcached  Redis. Is there advantages to one or the other Is something like this possible How would I go about implementing this Are there other optionsp  pAppreciate the helpp

Negative 1249 pIn Windows, when you press Alt, and release it again, the menu bar gets activated. However, when you press Alt, then click, then release, the menu bar does not get activated because presumably you wanted to Altclick, not activate the menu bar.p  pI want to support Altmouse wheel changes which would map to horizontal scrolling. This works fine, but if you are ready and release the Alt key, the menu bar activates. Obviously this is not desirable. There must be some kind of action that Windows does internally when you Altclick to cancel the internal ActivateMenuBarWhenAltIsReleased flag. If I know what it is, I can do this myself when I receive a mouse wheel message.p  pSo, does anyone know how the system works that activates the menu bar when you press and release Alt, and how to cancel this Thanksp

Negative 1249 pI used to work in Delphi 6, and got very used to having CodeRushs various helpful IDE additions.  Many are now in the IDE itself, or Ive managed to replace with something else, but the one feature I REGULARLY find myself wishing I had in Delphi 2007 still, is the ability CodeRush had that added little connecting lines between components that were linked to each other lines showing the connections between TDataSets and TDataSources, for instance.  p  pDoes anyone make something that does that in the newer Delphi IDE  p  p  LATER NOTE  Clarification  p  pAndreas is correct in his comments below... I dont think that he meant structural highlighting which works on the source code. He wants connection lines between components in the form designer.p  pHe also says as far as I know there is no such tool for Delphi 2005 or newer.. which is a bummer if true.  ...and if that IS the case, whats the best place to make Delphi IDE feature requestsp
Negative 1249 pMy primary language right now is D, and Im in the process of learning Python because its required for a course Im taking.  While I understand why dynamic languages would be a breath of fresh air for people programming in static languages without type inference or templates IMHO templates are to a large extent compiletime duck typing, Im curious what the benefits are of dynamic languages even when you have those.  p  pThe bottom line is that, if Im going to learn Python, I want to learn it in a way that really changes my thinking about programming, rather than just writing D in Python.  I have not used dynamic languages since I was a fairly novice programmer and unable to appreciate the flexibility they supposedly offer, and want to learn to take full advantage of them now.  What can be done easilyelegantly in a dynamically typed, interpreted language thats awkward or impossible in a static language, strongeven with templates, polymorphism, static type inference, and maybe runtime reflectionstrongp

Negative 1249 pI have an idea of how interrupts are handled by a dual core CPU.  I was wondering about how interrupt handling is implemented on a board with more than one physical processor. p  pIs any of the interrupt responsibility determined by the physical boards configuration  Each processor must be able to handle some types of interrupts, like disk IO.  Unless there is some circuitry to manage and dispatch interrupts to the appropriate processor  My guess is that the scheme must be processor neutral, so that any processor and core can run the interrupt handler.p  pIf a core is waiting on a disk read, will that core be the one to run the interrupt handler when the disk is ready p

Negative 1249 pLets say I have a Size class which has height and width properties in reality the class is a bit more complex than this, but Size makes a good example.p  pI want to display this as width x height in my UI.p  pThe obvious way to do this is to bind to a dimensions property which is dependent on width and height.p  pMy question is where is the best place to add this new propertyp  pI could add it to the Size class itself in the modal, but then if another controller wants to display the string different Im stuck creating yet another property. Im also a bit reluctant to do this because in my case the Size class is in a framework that will be used in a couple different places although likely all from code I have control over.p  pI could add it in a category to the Size class inside the project containing the viewcontroller so it will only be availiable in the places I know it will be used, but in various places Ive seen suggestions that categories tend to be overused, and am forced to wonder if this is one of those cases.p  pIn the case of a single Size instance I could create the property in the controller class containing it, but this becomes more difficult when you have an array of Sizes.p  pI could bind to the entire size object and use a transformer to turn them into strings, but binding to an array of sizes would then cause you to have to transform each element of the array into a new array in the transformer, which seems a bit ugly.p

Negative 1249 pIn my web application framework currently WebForms I have a control that behaves like a classic propertygrid. It is initialized with an object ID database key, then it reads metadata to determine the type of the object and the attributes of the object.

On page submit there is a method of the control ctrl.SaveData that saved the changed attribute values back to the database.p  pThe WebForm control tree and event model supports this approach quite nicely. Now I am asking myself if it is possible to achieve a similar solution for ASP.NET MVC.

Negative 1249 pI am using ADO.Net  C  VSTS 2008  ADO.Net to connect to SQL Server 2008 Enterprise.

Negative 1249 pI have a control extending PropertyGrid which allows users to set the properties of some of my program objects. These objects have an event which is raised when one of their properties changes, and the PropertyGrid subscribes to this event so that it refreshes itself when a property is changed. My problem occurs when large numbers of objects are selected, and the user sets a property on all of the objects at once. The control gets swamped with Refresh requests, which take a long time for example, setting a property on 300 objects takes about 20 seconds with the autorefresh feature turned on, and just a fraction of a second when it is turned off.p  pI would like to prevent the event handler from refreshing the grid while the property grid is in the process of setting a property, but unfortunately I havent been able to find any way to determine when the grid starts and stops setting the property. I was hoping there would be methods or something I could override, such as...p  precodeoverride void OnSetPropertyStart      suppressRefresh  true  override void OnSetPropertyEnd      suppressRefresh  false  codepre  pUnfortunately this doesnt seem to be the case. Is there any other way to determine when the property grid is setting a property, or to otherwise achieve this same effectp

Negative 1249 pWhen a user adds a new item in my system, I want to produce a unique nonincrementing pseudorandom 7digit code for that item.  The number of items created will only number in the thousands lt10,000.p  pBecause it needs to be unique and no two items will have the same information, I could use a hash, but it needs to be a code they can share with other people  hence the 7 digits.p  pMy original thought was just to loop the generation of a random number, check that it wasnt already used, and if it was, rinse and repeat.

I seem to be in the same situation as the original asker I have a plist with a hierarchy of dictionaries that define a configuration screen. These are emnotem mutable and emwillem stay the same throughout the application. Since the original discussion seems to focus on problems arising from mutating the dictionary, I must ask for comfirmation is the order of a dictionary guaranteed the same as they are in the plist, i.e. as it is read with initWithContentsOfFile Can I use allKeys on it in this case to get a correctorder array of keys if the dictionary never changesp

Negative 1249 pI have an MVC application with a single model and several views something like skins.

The most simple approach looks like thisp  precode void switchToADifferentView UIView newView       self is a descendant of UIViewController     self.view  newView  codepre  pThis does not work because the incoming view does not get rotated according to current orientation until the next orientation change, a hrefhttpgithub.comzoulOrientationZoo relnofollowtest casea. Is there a way to force the orientation on a view It looks like the system is trying really hard to keep the interface controls for itself. Or is it as simple as setting the right transform by handp  pI figured Id better not switch the views directly and switch controllers instead. This makes sense, as it makes the initial code simpler. But how do I switch controllers that have no navigation relation between them I guess I could use codepresentModalViewControllercode, but that seems like a hack. Same goes for navigation controller.

I am testing to see if the created IWebProxy is valid for the specified path and file and then downloading the file.p  pThe first piece of code I put above and this code using the WebClient are in separate classes and are called at different times, yet using a message box in the first bit of code still makes the whole thing run fine, which confuses me. Not sure what all is happening here or why message boxes and runningdebugging in Visual Studio makes the program run OK. Suggestionsp

Negative 1249 pThis may have been asked previously, but I search the stack and couldnt find any which really hit upon this.p  pI just finished work on a Cprogram where Ive implemented my own exceptions although derived from stdexception. The practice Ive applied when one exception causes a chain reaction, propagating the error upwards and giving rise to other exceptions, is to concatenate the error message at each appropriate step across the modules read classes. I.e. the old exception itself is dropped and a new exception is created, but with a longer error message.p  pThis may have worked for my small program, but I wasnt very satisfied with my approach in the end. For one, line numbers although not applied at the moment and file names are not retained except for the last exception and really that information is of most interest in the first exception.p  pI figure this could have been handled better by chaining exceptions together i.e. the old exception is provided in the constructor of the new exception. But how would that be implemented Does not exceptions die when they go out of scope from the method, thereby preventing one to use exception pointers And how to copy and store the exception if the exception can be of any derived classp  pThis ultimately lead me to consider whether chaining exceptions in C is such a good idea after all. Perhaps one should just create one exception and then add additional data to that like Ive been doing, but probably in a much better mannerp  pWhat is your response to this Should exceptions caused by another be chained together to retain a sort of exception trace  and how should that be implemented  or should a single exception be used and additional data attached to it  and how should that be donep

Negative 1249 pIve seen many different ways to serialize objects in C that Im not sure which one to use and when.   p  pIn the current situation Im serializing for exposure through WCF so Im guessing the [DataContract] attribute is the way to go. p  pCurrently Im reading in some XML, then exposing the resulting object through WCF. So I am deserializing XML for which I have no access to the original classes therefore Im rebuilding the class and can implement serialization whichever way I want. Then it has to be serializable for the WCF. p  pBut if [DataContract] is good for this case, then why wouldnt I use it all the time instead of ISerializable, or the [Serializable] attributep  pSo a bit of two questions in one, which to use for this problem, and why are there different ways to serialize.p
Negative 1249 pI am doing some large timestamplist iterations Putting them in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3888595listofeventswithalistoftimestampsgroupedbyhourinatabulardisplayitables with daterangesa, and grouping them by ranges.  In order to do that, I found codestrtotimecode a very helpfull function, but I am worried about its strongperformancestrong.p  pFor example, a function that loops over a list of weeks say, week 49 to 05 and has to decide the beginning of the week and the timestamp at the end of that week. A usefull way to do that, would bep  precodeforeach thisgtweeksfirst, amount as startsat    endsat  strtotime1 week, startsat   groups[weekkey]  thisgtslicetimestamps, startsat, endsat   thisgtweeks returns a list of timestamps at which each week starts. thisgtslice is a simple helper that returns only the timestamps within a range, from a list of timestamps.  codepre  pInstead of codestrtotimecode, I could, potentially, find out the amount of seconds between begin and end of the week, 99 of the times that would be code24  60  60  7code. But in these rare cases where there is a DSTswitch, that 24 should either be 23 or 25. Code to sort that out, will probably be a lot slower then codestrtotimecode, notp  pI use the same patterns for ranges of years, months months, being very inconsistent, days and hours. Only with hours would I suspect simply adding code3600code to the timestamp is faster. p  pAny other gotchas Are there ways that do not depend on PHP5.3 that offer better routes for consistent, DST and leapyear safe daterangesp

Negative 1249 pGood morning.  I have an application that queries a REST source.  It needs to run continuously, capturing data which is refreshed every five minutes, without fail.  My solution is Task Scheduler, where the app is set to launch on server boot.  Once launched, it uses a timer to requery periodically.  The TS task is set to repeat every five minutes, with the check box if app is already running, do not start another instance, so if the app crashes it should restart automatically within five minutes.p  pThis works fine, but TS launches the app invisibly.  Id feel warmer and fuzzier inside if I could emseeem the app, just as if Id launched it myself.  Also, if I need to close it e.g., to post a new exe, I have to kill it via Task Manager ouch.  Ive gone over the TS options a dozen times for some kind of launch in foreground option, but none exists.  Can anyone tell me what Im missingp  pNotesp  ul liFrom my web searches, its clear that an app is only allowed to interact with the desktop if its running under the same user account... but it is, Im using my AD account, not SYSTEM or another local account.li liIts acceptable for the app to only be visible to me, though even better would be if other users could also see and interact with it.  I suppose the only way that would work would be if each user had their own monitor app which just reflected results exposed from a single invisible app which actually did the work.li liI get the same behavior if I start the TS task manually or if it launches on boot automatically.li liRun only when the user is logged on wont do, as I need it to resume even if the server restarts in the middle of the night.li liI had been launching the app with a little PS script, so I could send a notification if the app failed to launch at all, but theres no change if I have TS launch it directly.li ul  pI suppose the proper solution would be to write this as a service.  I put some time into that, but I havent done that before and couldnt get it running.  If the consensus is that that would be a better approach, Ill give it another try.p  pAny ideas  Thanksp

Negative 1249 pIm trying to set up a production environment for about 10 related assets. Certain elements, visual and otherwise, are going to be shared between the 10 assets. Im treating each one as its own Pure AS3 project in Flash Builder 4. p  pEach asset has an associated .fla which is outputting a .swc into the libs folder for that asset  the final compilation is going to be done via ant, and the toplevel source is the main .as file in each Flash Builder project.p  pBecause certain elements are shared between multiple assets, Ive created a Flex Library Project in my workspace. This library project has a src folder with a standard structure, as well as a lib folder in which Im sticking, for instance, greensocks TweenLite.p  pIn addition to the source code and thirdparty .swc, the Library project also has an FLA which exports a .swc into the lib folder.p  pHeres the problem Im not able to see library exports from that .swc in my related projects. In theory, every class I export from the library of the Flex Library Projects .fla should be compiled into the library projects .swc. Im finding that this is not the case, and Im not clear why.p  pIm going to continue digging, but I wanted to throw this up here in case anyone else has run into these issues. Anyone know what Im doing wrongp  pEDIT So apparently my greensock .swc isnt being compiled into the final output either. Yesterday it was. Im not sure what has changed. I guess my question, distilled down, is this how can I make sure that .swc files included in the build path for my Flex Library Project have all of their classes included in the final .swc that the FLP generatesp  pEDIT2 Ive discovered a sort of a terrible workaround. Right now Ive created a single class in my src folder and Im declaring anything that I want included from any of my .swcs  so for instance, public var tweenLiteTweenLite, public var logoLogo, etc. I find that if I declare it in one of my source files then Im able to access it in a related project. Importing it alone is not enough  this means that I would have to manually declare every class I want access to. There must be a better way. What am I missingp

I want the user to be able to enter the characters such as amp and , but not enter the invalid sequences such as amp.p  pWhy not just use a regular expression Because when the form is submitted, all the fields are passed to the server...including fields that are not part of the validation group. These fields do not get checked and may trigger the A potentially dangerous Request.Form value, aka the HttpRequestValidationException. And preventing that message is the whole point of this.

Negative 1249 pAt our school district we support about 2,000 Windows 7 PCs. We have created a Windows 7 gadget that sits in the users top right corner and displays the computer name and IP.  This aids us when a user calls so that we can remotely connect to the computer they are on.p  pThe problem is the screen resolution varies quite a bit all over our district.  Some use 1024x768 on 17 monitors and others use much larger resolutions if they have 20 or multiple screens.p  pOn larger screens the gadget actually appears more towards the center.  This is because a GPO adds the gadget to the users desktop and the gadgets ini file contains the X amp Y locations of the gadget.p  pThis is stored in the PrivateSettingGadgetDropLocationX  XXX and PrivateSettingGadgetDropLocationY  YYY settings where XXX and YYY are the number of pixels from the top left corner of the screen.p  pWhat I woudl love to do is have the Gadget itself find the users top right corner of the screen by simply finding the screen dimensions and moving itself.  This way the gadget would always appear in the topright no matter how small or large the users screen was.p  pDoes anyone have an idea on how to do this  I would love it if I could do something like PrivateSettingGadgetDropLocationX  1 or something to indicate 1 pixel from the top right.p  pIs there any way to move the gadget using JavaScript code in the gadget itself  p

Negative 1249 pMy application, when running on Tomcat, is not able to connect to my database when deployed as a .war in the webapps folder, but it can connect when I am running it through Eclipse directly. The code is exactly the same in both cases. In addition, other apps in the webapps folder, which originally could connect to the database, can no longer do so. The jdbc code is correct as I have tested it with offline applications or when running it through eclipse, but  not when I access it on, say, Chrome, using localhost. What has happened to my tomcat serverp  pNote the JDBC driver is the MS Access one.p

Negative 1249 pI have a VoIP app that uses a UILocalNotification to notify the user of an incoming call when the app is in the background. When a notification is presented I would like it to play a sound amp vibrate the phone  more than once and without presenting the same message repeatedly. I was able to do this by using a series of notifications   the first would immediately present the message and play a sound the phone would vibrate as well  following notifications were scheduled 3 seconds apart they do not have an alertBody and alertAction but do have the same soundname as used in the first notification. HERE IS MY PROBLEM.. if a soundName other than the UILocalNotificationDefaultSoundName is specified the phone will only vibrate for the first notification the sound will be played each time though. However, if the default soundName is used, then the phone will vibrate with each notification Is there another way to do thisp

The area in the script looks like this p  precodeuser  FbUser  extraDic    extraDic[userName]  Test  extraDic[userId]  me  extraDic[userInfo]  user  d.startActivityextrasextraDic, componentrunComponent  postActivity  codepre  pFbUser is the object in my java project that implements Parcelable. The bin of the project has been properly added to the sys.path in the Jython Monkeyrunner script.  When I debug the script, it creates the FbUser object correctly, however, when I print out the extras in LogCat, the userInfo extra is missing...  This appears to be because the class JythonUtils will only translate PyString, PyFloat and PyInteger to String, Double and Integer even though the documentation for MonkeyDevice states you can pass emanyem structured data type in the extras dictionary.

Negative 1249 pHeres the problem. I have to support an existing sql function that calculates student activities based on items in several tables.  This function is called constantly It is called for calendar displays, outputing schedules and when students participate in an activity they are checked in to the activity determined by the function. Im using VB.Net, ASP.net also.  AND of course the function has 4 cursors written throughout so performance is pretty bad, I did an sql profiler.  I commented out the function parts for testing purposes and rewrote using  temp tables and while loops.  Now trying to install as a function and test, I get the dreaded error message Cannot access temporary tables from within a function.  Oh and theres more good news this function is 18 printed pages, it is huge. Not my definition of a function. I really cant rewrite the whole thing now so what are my optionsp  pThanks, pmmp

Negative 1249 pWhat I want to achieve is to have an etcinit.d script which more reliably starts Mongodb, even if it went down hard  it should attempt an autorepair in case the system is in a locked state.p  pYes, I could script this myself, but I think somebody out there must have done this already.p  pI noticed that after a server goes down hard, that Mongodb is in a state where it doesnt restart via the etcinit.dmongod script.

In some cases one also needs to change the ownership of the dbfiles to the user who runs mongodb.

Negative 1249 pIm working on a Swing application where the user can dynamically add tabs to a tabbed pane. We are running into the problem where the user adds so many tabs that they dont all fit on one line. I know that there are two options for the tab layout policy and the scrolling policy may ultimately be sufficient, but Im curious if theres a way to replicate the Eclipse Show List button in Swing. That is, if you are using the Eclipse IDE and you open, say, too many Java files at once, the tabbed pane will add a button to the right of the rightmost tab that you click to show a set of hidden tabs, i.e. the tabs that dont fit. Is this possiblep  pThanks,p  pDavidp

I thought it might be something with the cert but I have beat that to death and created a couple different certs one using server name set to localhost etc.... p  pA Google search for this turns up almost nothing. p  pAnyone got a clue what this is, or just tell me where I can maybe look Like I said  I have been through this code many times, I see the authorization policy get created and all that good stuff, I can see the certificate is set, I just dont know where else to look, I really dont have any code to post, there are so many classes you have to implement. If someone has an idea of what maybe I can look at I will be happy to post that particular class  code snippet. p  pThanksp

If I open detail windows directly from the main window, I know how to add an event listener  and it works  but I dont know how to do it, if the detail window is opening from the menubarp  pThanks for helping me.p
Negative 1249 pI am trying to present a view by making it emerge from the centre of the screen while growing to its full size, while also rotating it around the xaxis in a 3D manner. When I create the view I apply a transform to it to make sure it is shrunk and rotated to start off with it is so small it is not actually visible, then I try to use a CATransform3D like thisp  precodeCABasicAnimation anim  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathtransform] CATransform3D transform  CATransform3DRotateview.layer.transform, MPI, 1.0, 0, 0 transform  CATransform3DScaletransform, 1000, 1000, 1000 transform.m34  1.0  10000 [anim setToValue[NSValue valueWithCATransform3Dtransform]] [anim setDuration0.75f] anim.removedOnCompletion  NO anim.delegate  self [view.layer addAnimationanim forKeygrow] codepre  pHowever this animation does not change the actual transform of the layer, so I also do thisp  precode voidanimationDidStopCAAnimation theAnimation finishedBOOLflag      view.layer.transform  CATransform3DIdentity     [view.layer removeAllAnimations]  codepre  pto set the transform once the animation stops. However this sometimes results in a noticeable flicker at the end of the animation. I believe this is because the animation puts the original transform back at the end of the animation phase and this happens momentarily before the animationDidStop routine gets called. Is there a better way to do thisp  pEdit Incorporating it into a UIView animation works as this way you can set the transform directlyp  precodeview.layer.transform  CATransform3DScaleCATransform3DIdentity, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001 view.layer.transform  CATransform3DRotateview.layer.transform, MPI, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0  [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextNULL] [UIView setAnimationDuration0.75] [UIView setAnimationCurveUIViewAnimationCurveEaseOut] CATransform3D transform  CATransform3DRotateview.layer.transform, MPI, 1.0, 0, 0 transform  CATransform3DScalerotationTransform, 1000, 1000, 1000 transform.m34  1.0  500 view.layer.transform  transform [UIView commitAnimations] codepre  pHowever, I would still like an answer to my original query, as to how to achieve the same successully using a CAAnimation, as that provides more flexibility for animations generally.p  pEdit2 It seems the answer to my original question how to fix the problem with the CAAnimation was actually very straightforward. To keep the end state and remove the flicker, I just needed to add the following linep  precodeanim.fillMode  kCAFillModeForwards codepre

Negative 1249 pI have just been asked to fix our address DB in work as it is very slow, i dont normaly go near it as another guy looks after it but he has left now so its down to me.p  pproblem is the DB contains 5 tables and a lot of information is replicated in each table there should be 27 million rows however there are 30 million rows so there are over 3 million rows repeated, and the way our old IT guy had it setup was when there was a query it would search all 5 tables an he used a php script to weed out the duplicate rows so information was only shown once. and this is slowing our server down considerably, so I wrote a php script to take each row an compare it against the 30 million others and if there was a duplicate to delete it, however 2 mins after i started it the server crashed so i tried a few other scripts using php however every time i try to run a complex mysql query the server crashes.p  pIs there an easy way that wont crash the server to merge all the tables an delete all the duplicated entriesp  pCopy of the DBp  precodepost1           10,044,279   MyISAM    latin1german2ci   758.1 MiB    post2            8,328,333   MyISAM    latin1german2ci   624.7 MiB    postcode         9,344,317   MyISAM    latin1german2ci   703.8 MiB    postcodenw      1,157,217   InnoDB    utf8unicodeci      97.6 MiB    postcodetmp     1,749,650   MyISAM    latin1german2ci    50.5 MiB    codepre
Negative 1249 pI would like to understand what might be going on with invoking variablearity methods using Java reflection. Lets say we have a simple methodp  precodevoid doAllTheThingsObject ... things     ...which does something with all the things...  codepre  pAnd we want to invoke it dynamically, so we grab the method through reflectionp  precodeMethod doItAll  Superklass.getDeclaredMethoddoAllTheThings, Object[].class codepre  pAnd pass in an arrayp  precodeObject[] allTheThings  new Object[]  abc, true, 15  doItAll.invokeallTheThings codepre  pNow, this doesnt seem to work quite like my intuition had figured in particular, I seem to be getting various shades of codeIllegalArgumentExceptioncode when I try invoking a method with varargs like this. p  pTheres clearly something Im missing here.

Negative 1249 pI have been trying to find the right designtoolset which can help our business users. They have enormous data in excel files which they push through to various excel formulas and calculations usually and mostly on a row by row basis and vlookups from other sheets. In trying to design a system for them, i want to enable them to define the business rules so that we can stick to designing and implementing the system, which will change state according to the business rules defined  What current stack of technologies would be able to support this p  pSo basically something like this  we dump all their up to 400k and growing data safely assuming that all rules and formulas will be applied on a row by row basis, into a database. We setup a webpage for them to author rules. The java runtime kicks in on the rules defined to apply them on a row by row basis.p  pAny design technologydesign which can nearly match the computation power of excel and ease of defining rules for business analysts  Any pointers to designsetup will be appreciated .p

Negative 1249 pCurrently were trying to move to JSF 2.0 from JSF 1.2 and one of the problem weve faced is that its impossible to rerender part of the page that contains form.

As soon as a rectangle is outside the cameras view, its height is changed and it is moved to the extreme right.p  pSo to change the height, if I change the floats in the FloatBuffer, then I need to do it for just two rectangles in one frame but if I use glScalef Ill have to do it for all 40.p  pIt seems to me that the first method is the more efficient way to go but then I remember reading somewhere that FloatBuffer.put is expensive and also that scaling 100 times a frame isnt much of a big deal.p  pBut since Im a newbie Im all confused about which should be the better thing to do in terms of performance.p

Negative 1249 pLet me start by confessing that I come from an Erlang background and am new to Android and Java programming... to be honest object orientation is giving me a headache.  p  pI am having some trouble with the sticky old chestnut Cannot make a static reference to the nonstatic method. Basically I am writing an app that receives XML from our server and uses it to create a form to be filled in by the user. I have managed to successfully parse the XML and create and display the form. I assign each EditText field its own ID using a very simple algorithm that I can recreate later.p  pI am busy with the submit button, which makes a HTTP post back to our server with the user entered details. My problem comes in when I try to retrieve the values that the user has entered into the form. What I am attempting to do is loop through my IDs, open each EditText instance using  EditText.findViewByIdID and retrieve its text using getText. When i do so however I receive the error Cannot make a static reference to the nonstatic method.p  pNow Ive done some reading and the way I understand it is that this is because I am trying access a a nonstatic method in a static way and in order to make it static I need to call the method of an instance rather than the class in general... the problem is that I am calling it IN ORDER to get that particular instance and I cant figure out what I should be doing differently.p  pI would really appreciate any help, advice or further reading that anyone has for me.p  pCheers, Bevanp  pp.s.

Negative 1249 pfirst, I am aware of the amount of Python memory error questions on SO, but so far, none has matched my use case.p  pI am currently trying to parse a bunch of textfiles 6k files with 30 GB and store each unique word. Yes, I am building a wordlist, no I am not planning on doing evil things with it, it is for the university.p  pI implemented the list of found words as a set created with codewords  set[]code, used with codewords.addwordcode and I am just adding every found word to it, considering that the set mechanics should remove all duplicates.p  pThis means that I need permanent access to the whole set for this to work Or at least I see no alternative, since the whole list has to be checked for duplicates on every insert.p  pRight now, I am running into codeMemoryErrorcode about 25 through, when it uses about 3.4 GB of my RAM. I am on a Linux 32bit, so I know where that limitation comes from, and my PC only has 4 Gigs of RAM, so even 64 bit would not help here.p  pI know that the complexity is probably terrible Probably On on each insert, although I dont know how Python sets are implemented trees, but it is still probably faster and definitly more memory efficient than adding each word to a primitive list and removing duplicates afterwards.p  pIs there any way to get this to run I expect about 610 GB of unique words, so using my current RAM is out of the question, and upgrading my RAM is currently not possible and does not scale too well once I start letting this script loose on larger amounts of files.p  pMy only Idea at the moment is caching on Disk Which will slow the process down even more, or writing temporary sets to disk and merging them afterwards, which will take even more time and the complexity would be horrible indeed.

Negative 1249 pI have found partial answers between the docs, mailing lists, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10300660cythonanddistutilsthis question herea, but I wanted to get a more direct answer addressing my specifics...p  pIm learning cython by trying to wrap small parts, little by little, of a library that I am already using that is currently wrapped in boostpython. I have contributed a tiny bit to this boost wrapper, and am using it as a c reference, while at the same time I am using a hrefhttpsgithub.comzeromqpyzmqtreemasterzmqcore relnofollowZeroMQ Python bindingsa as a cython reference.p  pMy question is about project structure. The current boost version of this lib compiles to a single code.socode, and that is my goal. I quickly found out that you cannot directly compile multiple code.pyxcode modules to a single code.socode. I then started going down the route of defining the codecppclasscodes in codepxdcode files, and their corresponding python exported implementation classes in code.pxicode, and was trying to include them into a single codepyxcode for compilation. While it worked at first, once I wrote a little more I hit problems with conflicting multiple definitions because of the codepxicode includes in different places.p  pI would love to hear a proper organizational approach that addresses the following questions and goalsp  ul liNaming the public classes the same as the codecppclasscode I am doing this now by having the cppclass in a different named codepydcode and using the imported namespace to handle the similar names, ala a hrefhttpdocs.cython.orgsrcuserguidesharingdeclarations.htmlusingcimporttoresolvenamingconflicts relnofollowUsing cimport to resolve naming conflictsali liSingle code.socode as the compiled output a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10300660cythonanddistutilsacceptable approachali liDo I use the codepyxcode multiinclude approach into the main codepyxcode for that alone, or should that main codepyxcode contain anything else beyond just holding the includesli liWhere to centrally define constants that will be exported in pythonli liIs there a preferred folder structure Right now I have everything in a big codesrccode directory beneath my codesetup.pycode. It gets confusing seeing so many codepxi, pxd, pyxcode files.li liAre codepxicode completely unnecessary now If not, do I need to use a cythonstyle ifndef guard to handle the multiple inclusions between different modules li liI know the ZeroMQ python bindings build multiple modules and use the package approach by including them through codeinit.pycode. Is that really the proper approach with cythonli ul  pFor reference, the project I am practicing to rewrap is a hrefhttpsgithub.comjustinfxPyOpenNI relnofollowPyOpenNIa openni. The pattern this boost project takes is to collect the common objects in one place, and then define a 1to1 header definition with the source, and then there is a huge wrapper that collects all of the definitions into the single location. And also the added custom exception handling and utilities.p

The onReceive method, where I should update the textview on a button click, is thisp  precode    Override public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent      remoteViews  new RemoteViewscontext.getPackageName, R.layout.stopwatchwidgetlayout     if intent.getAction.equalsACTIONSTOPWATCHWIDGETSTART          if sStart  0L              sStart  System.currentTimeMillis          else              sStart  System.currentTimeMillis  elapsedTime                  sHandler.removeCallbacksstartStopwatch         sHandler.postDelayedstartStopwatch, REFRESHRATE          ComponentName widget  new ComponentNamecontext, StopwatchWidgetProvider.class     AppWidgetManager.getInstancecontext.updateAppWidgetwidget, remoteViews     super.onReceivecontext, intent  codepre  pThis is the same code I use to update it for the actual app, which works, only this is modified for the app widget.  I know that the time is properly updating   if I display it in the log it updates the time correctly.  I also know that the textview will properly change, if I change it directly in the onReceive method.  Everything seems to be working, but for some  reason it wont update the times when it tries to in the Runnable, so Im really not sure how to fix this.p  pIve also tried it using a service, but that didnt work any better.  The code for it isp  precodepublic class SWStartService extends Service   RemoteViews remoteViews long sStart  0 long elapsedTime private final int REFRESHRATE  100 private Handler sHandler  new Handler private Runnable startStopwatch  new Runnable      Override     public void run          final long start  sStart         elapsedTime  System.currentTimeMillis  start         updateStopwatchelapsedTime         sHandler.postDelayedthis, REFRESHRATE       String sMain, sMillis  private void updateStopwatchlong time      int seconds  int time  1000     int minutes  seconds  60     int hours  minutes  60     long millis  time  1000     seconds  seconds  60      remoteViews.setTextViewTextR.id.tvStopwatchWidget, String.formatd  02d  02d, hours, minutes, seconds     remoteViews.setTextViewTextR.id.tvStopwatchMillisWidget, String.format. 03d, millis     Intent i1  new IntentgetApplicationContext, SWStartService.class     sMain  String.formatd  02d  02d, hours, minutes, seconds     sMillis  String.format. 03d, millis       Log.dTEST TIME, String.formatd  02d  02d . 03d, hours, minutes, seconds, millis   Override public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId      remoteViews  new RemoteViewsgetApplicationContext.getPackageName, R.layout.stopwatchwidgetlayout     if sStart  0L          sStart  System.currentTimeMillis      else          sStart  System.currentTimeMillis  elapsedTime          sHandler.removeCallbacksstartStopwatch     sHandler.postDelayedstartStopwatch, 100     intent.putExtrasMainWidget, sMain     intent.putExtrasMillisWidget, sMillis      sendBroadcastintent     return STARTREDELIVERINTENT   Override public IBinder onBindIntent intent      return null  codepre  pp  pThat service is called in the onReceive method like thisp  precodeIntent intent1  new Intentcontext, SWStartService.class context.startServiceintent1 codepre  pIve tried a few other techniques to start the service, I still cant get the TextView to update though.p  pI know its pretty sloppy, I tried several different techniques to get it working, but none of it worked and I didnt clean up the old techniques.  It didnt work with changing the remoteViews directly, or with changing them in the appwidget class by getting the extras from the intent.  Everything just returns blanknull  the intent extras, or the remoteViews, in or out of the service for some reason. And I realize this might not be very good for the battery or very efficient, but its bothering me that I cant even update the TextView at all.p  pAny suggestionsp  pstrongEditstrong  Someone might want the solution, so herep  precodeGlobal Variables ComponentName widget AppWidgetManager awManager  Set them up in onReceive method     remoteViews  new RemoteViewscontext.getPackageName, R.layout.stopwatchwidgetlayout     widget  new ComponentNamecontext, StopwatchWidgetProvider.class     awManager  AppWidgetManager.getInstancecontext     if intent.getAction.equalsACTIONSTOPWATCHWIDGETSTART          showStopButton         if sStart  0              sStart  System.currentTimeMillis          else              sStart  System.currentTimeMillis  elapsedTime                  sHandler.removeCallbacksstartStopwatch         sHandler.postDelayedstartStopwatch, REFRESHRATE          awManager.updateAppWidgetwidget, remoteViews     super.onReceivecontext, intent  update appwidget in runnable         final long start  sStart         elapsedTime  System.currentTimeMillis  start         updateStopwatchelapsedTime         sHandler.postDelayedthis, REFRESHRATE         awManager.updateAppWidgetwidget, remoteViews codepre

Negative 1249 pI just got pulled into a project where we are converting old VB6 applications to .NET. Within the application they are passing around the ADODB connection object and grabbing the existing connection string from it which could be a primary or secondary connection string depending on the status of the database.p  pThe specific problem I am having is that sometimes when .open is called on the ADODB connection, the object resets its connection string to some sort of ProviderMSDASQL.1. I have found one forum post that just states that the poster believes this to be some sort of bug in ADODB but cant find anything to confirm or any work around. Another thing to note is that the ConnectionString data is not always reset.p  pHas anyone seen this before and have a suggestion as to what is causing ADODB to reset its objects ConnectionString on the .Open callp  pThanksp

Negative 1249 pIve recently finished integrating the latest FB iOS SDK 3.0 into my app iOS 5. Ive stepped through the tutorials, and everything appears to be in place according to the FB provided docs. The issue Im having is that whenever I check to see if I need to authenticate viap  pif[self openSessionWithAllowLoginUINO]      [self openSessionWithAllowLoginUIYES] p  p... often and almost always after [FBSession.activeSession close] openSessionWithAllowLoginUI returns NO, and I have to transition to the authentication dialog to get a valid session. According to my understanding, [FBSession.activeSession close] should not disrupt the ability of the SDK to reuse old tokens and allow me to recreate a session without having to display the login dialog.p  pNote that in my app, I dont require Facebook authentication for the duration of the app lifetime. Therefore, I tend to establish sessions on demand, and tear them down with [FBSession.activeSession close] exactly when Im done, as opposed to only having [FBSession.activeSession close] in applicationWillTerminate.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on what I might be doing wrong or things to tryp  pThanks. p

Negative 1249 pIn my ASP .NET MVC 2  application, there are several controllers, that need the session state.

Negative 1249 pKendo UI V. 2012.2.924p  pSo Im trying to do something pretty messed up with my kendo tree view. The situation is this I have a kendo tree view with on demand loading. I also implemented special placeholder nodes that can be clicked to append additional nodes to each level as a way of batching.p  pThe feature I need to implement is a search. The user can enter a node name and the tree will expand to that node and select it. I have all the logic on the server figured out. The only problem is that with ondemand loading, every time I append a node to a parent, there is a server call to get the contents of that parent. I want to disable this automatic call until my manual appends have been completed. Anyone know if this can be done I have tried from the server, but if I just return null it has an error. If I return an empty list, it wipes out the existing appended nodes.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 1249 pIm currently working on a EF Fluent project yes, I do like writing it like that that is taking a model first approach with TablePerType architecture on EF 4.3.  p  pAs Ive found out over the past couple of months, TablePerType and inheritance just doesnt play nice  a hrefhttpsamscode.comindex.php201001theentityframeworkv1andv4dealbreakertptinheritance relnofollowmore informationa. Im using a single base class with seven derived classes and just returning items across the seven derived classes isnt particular fast.  In terms of execution timings, to retreive a list of five records EF is taking a between 5 to 7 seconds, subsequent executions are around the 2.5 to 4 second mark.  Safe to say this is just unacceptable so Im looking at alternative methods...p  pWhat I can do is hit the database multiple times, i.e. attempt to retreive each type of object individual and collate into a single collection however, the code is unwieldly at best, i.e.p  precodeIListltMyBaseClassgt items  new ListltMyBaseClassgt  dbContext.Database.SqlQueryltMyFirstDerivedClassgtSELECT  FROM MyBaseClass INNER JOIN MyFirstDerivedClass ON....ToList.ForEachx gt items.Addx  ... repeat for each derived class...  return items codepre  pBut it works  The first hit on the database takes 2 seconds and subsequent queries a mere 200 milliseconds.  p  pMy problem is that this is not very elegant, maintainable, etc, etc.  I have been toying with casting the dbContext into an ObjectContext and running with something like this with a stored procedure spGetMyDerivedItems returning all of the derived resultsets ordered in one db hit...p  precodeIListltMyBaseClassgt items  new ListltMyBaseClassgt  ObjectContext oContext  IObjectContextAdapterdbContext.ObjectContext  using var connection  oContext.Connection as EntityConnection      EntityCommand command  connection.CreateCommand     command.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure     command.CommandText  spGetMyDerivedItems     connection.Open      using EntityDataReader reader  command.ExecuteReader              oContext.TranslateltMyFirstDerivedClassgtreader.ToList.ForEach x gt items.Addx         reader.NextResult         ...repeat for each derived type...                  return items codepre  pHowever, this doesnt work with a InvalidOperationException complaining that the CommandText is not valid and that I must provide a ContainerName.  My guessing here is that if I was using an EDMX file, I could set this set item and using the DefaultContainerName doesnt work.  But Im taking a fluent approach and I feel Ive hit a dead end.p  pSo...p  pWhat approaches are available to resolving the performance problems of EF and tablepertype Is it possible to execute a stored procedure through the ObjectContext with Fluent  Model First approach Can I execute a standard SQLClient.SqlDataReader and translate into an ObjectContextp  pThanks in advance...p

Negative 1249 pIm building a page with a Google MAP that has a side bar with dynamically created divs linked to positions of markers in the map.p  pIm using ASP.NET MVC with JQuery and Google Maps API v3.p  pHere is a look of it. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCT6N9.jpg altMyPagep  pThis page is loaded in a splash window and is generated dynamically.p  pIn the background page the user types a state or city in an input field and in my controller action I search for all people that are located in that area and return a JSON. I get the JSON and populate the map with markers and then I make the list of divs in the side bar.p  pId like to add a function to those divs that when they are clicked the map will center at the marker.p  pI came up with an idea for this solution which I could not finish. p  pI added codeclassclickablecode and the attributes Lat and Lng with the values equal to the ones in the markers they are related to, and I tried to get their click event with JQuery and then set the map center with its Lat and Lng like thisp  precode.clickable div.clickfunction     mapcanvas.panTothis.attrlat, this.attrlng      codepre  pI had 2 problems with this approach.   First, I didnt know how to get the map with JQuery. I found 2 ways using like codemapcanvas.gMapcode but it didnt work. Tried a couple more things that Ive found here in Stackoverflow but also didnt work.p  pSecond  The JQuery would not catch the event click from the DIVs.  I tested on Google Chrome console the JQuery code and It worked but then my code would not trigger the click. I tried something like code.clickable div.clickfunction alerttest code on Google Chrome and it worked, but in my script it did not.p  pI also tried to add listeners using codeaddDomListenercode in my code but couldnt get around that either.p  pCould anyone please give me a light what would be a good way to do this without having to recreate the map when a div is clicked.p  pI also dont like the idea of adding Lat and Lng attributes to the divs, I dont know if that would work in any browser or if its good practice. Im just out of solutions to this.p  pHere is the code Im using.

Negative 1249 pI am trying to implement minimax with alphabeta pruning for a checkers game in Java. My minimax algorithm works perfectly. My code runs with the alphabeta code in place. Unfortunately, when I play 1000 games vs the standard minimax algorithm, the alphabeta algorithm always comes out behind by 50 games or so. p  pSince alphabeta pruning should not be reducing the quality of the moves, just the time it takes to achieve them, something has to be wrong. However, I have taken out pen and paper and drawn hypothetical leaf node values and used my algorithm to predict whether it will calculate the correct best move, and there doesnt appear to be any logic errors. I used the tree from this video a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchfeatureplayerdetailpageampvxBXHtz4GbdoAlphaBeta Pruninga to trace my algorithm. It logically should make all of the same choices, and therefore be a functioning implementation. p  pI have also put print statements into the code they have been removed to reduce the clutter, and values are being returned correctly it appears and pruning does happen. Despite my best efforts I have been unable to find where the logic error lies. This is my third different attempt at implementing this and all of them have had the same issue.p  pI cant post the full code here, its much too long, so I have included the methods that are relevant to the error. Im not certain, but I suspect the problem may likely be in the nonrecursive move method, though I cant find a logical error in it so Id just be thrashing around in it more, probably making things worse rather than better without having a rhyme or reason.p  pstrongIs there a trick to recovering multiple integer values from recursive calls in a for loopstrong It works fine with both my minimax and negamax implementations, but alphabeta pruning seems to produce some strange results.p  precodeOverride public GameState moveGameState state       int alpha  INFINITY     int beta  INFINITY     int bestScore  Integer.MAXVALUE     GameTreeNode gameTreeRoot  new GameTreeNodestate     GameState bestMove  null     forGameTreeNode child gameTreeRoot.getChildren              ifbestMove  null                      bestMove  child.getState                  alpha  Math.maxalpha, miniMaxchild, plyDepth  1, alpha, beta         ifalpha gt bestScore                      bestMove  child.getState             bestScore  alpha                   return bestMove   private int miniMaxGameTreeNode currentNode, int depth, int alpha, int beta       ifdepth lt 0  terminalNodecurrentNode.getState               return getHeuristiccurrentNode.getState          ifcurrentNode.getState.getCurrentPlayer.equalsselfColor              forGameTreeNode child currentNode.getChildren                      alpha  Math.maxalpha, miniMaxchild, depth  1, alpha, beta              ifalpha gt beta                              return beta                               return alpha          else              forGameTreeNode child currentNode.getChildren                      beta  Math.minbeta, miniMaxchild, depth  1, alpha, beta              ifalpha gt beta                              return alpha                               return beta       Checks to see if the node is terminal private boolean terminalNodeGameState state  ifstate.getStatus.equalswin  state.getStatus.equalslose  state.getStatus.equalsdraw              return true          else              return false       codepre

Negative 1249 pThe issue I am having is that when I update my object, the ListBox automatically removes and then readds the object to the list, thus calling the index and value changed events. I was able to prevent this by creating a custom ListBox control and when the PropertyChangedEvent was called, I would raise a flag that would prevent those events in the base class from being called. What is happening now is that my entire reference is being replace by a new reference and unless I reselect the item in the ListBox, I have the wrong reference.p  pWhat I basically want to do, is to change the Display Value in my object and then have it update only the text in the list box.

Negative 1249 pIm developing an application which has several buttons with a transparent background. One of these is a custom exit button, rather than using the standard windows border. This exit button has two colors, the other which is shown using the MouseEnter event. The exit button is a cross with a transparent background.p  pThe transparent background works fine, until you hover the button. Then the backcolor somehow appears to change to Control and the transparency is lost. Once you move the cursor away from the button its back to normal. The weird thing here is that the exact same button with the exact same code works on several other windows except this one, which is the main form.p  pI tried removing all Mouseevents and click events and only have a button with a transparent background. Now, even without any MouseEnter event and without any change of the button background image, the transparency is lost once you hover the button. So basically this is a static button with no function at all which still reacts once you hover it by changing the BackColor, whyp  pI have a vague memory of experiencing this issue before but I just cant seem to figure out what I did to solve it.p  pThanks in advance, Fredrikp

I want to ensure that the console application only works if it is launched by my AIR application.  What I was thinking is to have the console application issue a challenge to the AIR app and have the AIR app answer that challenge and send the answer back to the console app. If the answer is correct, the console app continues, otherwise it quits.  Since AIR apps can be decompiled I cant just include the private key to decode the challenge in the app. The user logs into the AIR app so I could use their password plus a random string as the key but I would have to pass it to the console app, which would expose it. I think this is probably a common problem that has an accepted best practice solution but I havent found it yet. p

This has resolved issue of hanging. Now I am just curious to know why would it behave in such manner where if you execute msdeploy.exe from cmd.exe it would hang while running directly msdeploy.exe it would execute successfully. Any insight into same would be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pI have added image which explains behavior using process explorer. If we kill msdeploy.exe from process explorer than for next all deployments to that server will not have the issue of build hanging.

Imports System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations     Imports System.Runtime.Serialization     Imports System.ComponentModelp  precodeltMetadataTypeAttributeGetTypeProductMetadatagt Public Class Product      Private validationResults As New ListOf ValidationResult     Public ReadOnly Property ValidationResults As ListOf ValidationResult         Get         Return validationResults     End Get End Property  Public Function IsValid As Boolean      TypeDescriptor.AddProviderTransparentNew AssociatedMetadataTypeTypeDescriptionProviderGetTypeProduct, GetTypeProductMetadata, GetTypeProduct      Dim result As Boolean  True      Dim context  New ValidationContextMe, Nothing, Nothing      Dim validation  Validator.TryValidateObjectMe, context, validationResults      If Not validation Then         result  False     End If      Return result  End Function  End Class  Friend NotInheritable Class ProductMetadata      ltRequiredErrorMessageProduct Name is Required, AllowEmptyStringsFalsegt     ltMaxLength50, ErrorMessageToo Longgt     Public Property ProductName As Global.System.String      ltRequiredErrorMessageDescription is Requiredgt     ltMinLength20, ErrorMessageDescription must be at least 20 charactersgt     ltMaxLength60, ErrorMessageDescription must not exceed 60 charactersgt     Public Property ShortDescription As Global.System.String      ltRequiredErrorMessageNotes are Requiredgt     ltMinLength20, ErrorMessageNotes must be at least 20 charactersgt     ltMaxLength1000, ErrorMessageNotes must not exceed 1000 charactersgt     Public Property Notes As Global.System.String  End Class codepre  pThe first line in the IsValid method registers the MetaData class only way I could find that actually worked  otherwise no annotations were honored. I then use the System.ComponentModel.Validator.TryValidateObject method to perform the validation.p  pWhen I call the IsValid method on an instance with an empty nullnothing ProductName the validation fails and the ValidationResults collection is populated with the correct error message. So far so good.....p  pHowever, if I call IsValid on an instance with a ProductName which is longer than 50 characters the validation passes despite the MaxLength attributep  pAlso, if I call IsValid on an instance with a valid ProductName not empty and not more than 50 characters but without a ShortDescription the validation passes even though there is a Required annotation on that property.p  pWhat am I doing wrong herep

Negative 1249 pI have been pulled onto a project at work that deals with rebuilding our machine lockout database. The current database was built in Microsoft Access 2003 I believe, and its a bit of a cluster... One of the biggest issues that I see with the current database, is that it is very difficult to navigate. p  pOne idea that I had to remedy this issue was to setup a form that was populated by dynamic buttons. These buttons would then allow users to navigate through the various tables. However, my lack of knowledge with Access 2007 is a bit of a hindrance, and I am not sure how to go about doing such a thing or if its even possible. Through my searching, I came across a couple different articles that indicated that dynamic controls are not possible in Access due to limitations in indexing something along those lines, but I am not sure if this would apply to dynamic button creation.p  pAny links to examples would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1249 pIm making a Windows Store app that gets files from a server and store it locally for quick access. I also want to make it sync the file with Dropbox and push changes to Dropbox if the user make any. I looked into CachedFileUpdater and it seems to work if I use another Windows Store app to edit the file. However I ran into a great trouble trying to monitor changes made by a desktop app. This matters a lot because many files are office documents and Office 2013 is available to Windows RT and I would also like the app to be available to Windows 8.p  pFirst I tried to use CachedFileUpdater on all files but when I open the file using a desktop app, it will be opened in readonly mode and I cant save it in desktop mode. If I dont use it if the user chooses to open it with desktop app, the change will be saved but later my app wont be able to access that file somehow. I guess it is because the owner changes to the desktop app. Now not only I seem to have no way to monitor the file changes, but also cant I access those changes once it is modified by a desktop app.p  pIs there some trick that may help Thank you very muchp

Negative 1249 pI have a project branch that was created off of a master branch about a month ago. Im trying to bring in all of the changes from the master branch into the project branch while still keeping the branches separate. I need an end result of a single commit that is a combination of the two branches that I can then push to our gerrit setup.p  pIve tried fetching the latest versions of both branches and then merging the master branch into the project branch. This resulted with a merge commit that joined the two branches. However, I want a single commit with all the changes that will play nicely with gerrit, so I tried rebasing the branch on top of originproject, but this then wanted me to go and merge the 600 commits in the master branch since the two split. Since this is the case, Im assuming pushing the commit at this point will result with gerrit requiring a crazy rebase as well.p  pI also tried rebasing and squashing the project branch on itself down to one commit above the point where it branched off, and then rebasing that one commit on top of the master branch. At the end it gave me a Refs refheadsproject is at [hash] but expected [different hash] error. This approach also would erase the commit history of my project branch, wouldnt itp  pIs there a better way to approach this Am I correct in my assumption that as long as the master branch doesnt have any of the project stuff in it, the next time I try to combine the two, Ill have the same conflictsp

I really dont want to hold a list of subscribers in the model, which is against the principle of loose coupling in a way. But if I only add a callback function to the codeTestModelcode in the codesubscribecode method, Im not able to access the codethis.stringcode variable in the codeTestViewcode. Because codethiscode points to the TestModel which has called the codetalkcode method. My workaround is the codeselfcode which leads to the need of a subscriberlist in the Model.p  pI also tried to initialize a self variable outside of the codeTestViewcode functions, in the codeTestViewcode function which is called and returned by RequireJS. But this function is only called once, and therefore the variable acts like a static variable in Java and is not unique in every instance of codeTestViewcode.p  pIs there a possibility to get a codeselfcodecodethiscode variable in the codetalkcode functions to access the string without handling it over by the codeTestModelcode like its done nowp

Negative 1249 pHey so I found this sweet jquery snippet by CSStricks Chris Coyier that resets div elements heights that share the same top position on the page are on the same row to the tallest element. p  pstrongThe Problemstrong This solution almost works with fluid width layouts and resets height when top positions changes but it resets it to the original height of the current tallest element in the row when the page first loaded. This is an issue because the height of the tallest element might have changed since this page first loaded because of the use of relative units like ems or because of word wrapping with paragraphs. strongProposed Solutionstrong The solution would be to have the rows elements height being set to the tallest elements current height, not the original height. I have been unsuccessful in accomplishing this.p  pHere is the snippet where li.half is the elements being compared and resized.p  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction   these are ruhroh globals.

Negative 1249 pI am currently setting up a web service powered by apache and running on CENTOS 6.4.

I examined apachesystem logs and nothing suspicious can be found.p  pIt appears that the problem occurs only when httpd is launched by etcrc[06].d startup directives. I tried to change the launch order of http S85httpd by default to any other position without success.p  pTo summarize, my web service is only functional with no external binary crash when httpd is launched at the command line once the server has fully booted upp  pstrong[EDIT] This issue is now resolvedstrongp  pMy fortran binary handles very large arrays and complex functions requiring an unlimited stack size.p  pDespite that the stack size limit was defined on a systemwide basis in etcsecuritylimits.conf, for any reason it appears that the apacheperlfortran binary ensemble was not aware of that causing my binary to crash each time it was called. At the contrary, when I manually restarted apache at the shell prompt, the stacksize limit was correctly passed .bashrc with ulimit S s unlimited.p  pAs a workaround, I used BSDResource module a hrefhttpmetacpan.orgpodBSD3a3aResource relnofollowhttpmetacpan.orgpodBSDResourcea to define stacksize directly in my perl script by using e.g. setrlimitRLIMITSTACK, softlimit, hardlimitp  pThus, this new stack size limit is now directly passed from my perl script to my binary. p

Negative 1249 pI have a program that is a homework assignment.  First we made a flight simulation, where we parsed xml files to load airplanes, cities, and flights.

Negative 1249 pI am very new to asp.net mvc techniques, and have a question about how to render a view. In my project, I need to retrieve an XML fileXML string from database. After getting this XML string, I deserialize xml to an object, say LogMessage, which I have defined already. Once I have got such a LogMessage object, I would like to display its contents to the user via a view. Additionally, I need to process some of the LogMessage properties before showing them to the user. For instance, 1 there is a logTime property in the LogMessage object, which is in utc format and I need to convert it to the local time, 2 there is a logCode property, which is in the format of int number 1,2,3, etc, and I need to convert each number to a meaningful  name, such as eventStart, eventEnd, etc. p  pWhat in my mind now is that I create a stronglytyped view of LogMessage type in asp.net mvc3, so that I can render the view with Razor. Also I put all the necessary functions e.g., for converting utc time to local time, mapping code number to its meaningful name, etc. in the same view file, and call them when rendering the view. p  pBut I am not sure whether I should do it as the aforementioned way or I should create another view model, say LogMessageViewModel as I think actually the LogMessage is my data model or not . Then once I have got the LogMessage object, I can create a LogMessageViewModel and LogMesageViewModel looks quite the same as LogMessage, and initialize the LogMessageViewModel with LogMessage and do all the necessary conversions in my Controller or Model, rather than do them in the View. Then now I have all the correct information in the LogMessageViewModel for the view, and create a stronglytyped view of LogMessageViewModel and simply render a view and show its contents to the user. p  pCould anyone give me some suggestions about these two different approaches or maybe there are some other better ones I hope I have made my question clear and sorry about my English. Thank you in advance p

Negative 1249 pThis is my first question here on Stackoverflow, so if Im doing something wrong, please tell me so I can improve it the next time.p  pSince its been a while since Ive done some programming in Java and even then only some simple stuff, Im still learning a lot about a lot off features and find it helpful to read discussions on this site.p  pI thought I understood the way Generics worked until I faced the following problem. I understand it isnt the nicest design or there are ways to solve it in another way, but lets say it must be done this way.br It is intended as a low layer in the application, so I liked Generics to make a connection with the layer on top.p  pstrongSituationstrongbr A base class codeIdentifieablecode is extended by codeGroupablecode, a class which can be extended by an codeItemcode, codeMutationcode, codeLocationcode, etc.p  pAs groups must be made of these things, I addedp  precodeclass GroupltT extends Groupablegt extends Groupable        public GroupId id              superid         content  new HashMapltT, Integergt           private final HashMapltT, Integergt content              Additional methods for adding, removing etc.  codepre  pI added the Generic here to restrict to be able to restrict a group to items, mutations, etc. A group must be groupable too.p  pAs I want to be able to know which groups I am part of I designed my codeGroupablecode as followsp  precode    class Groupable extends Identifieable               public GroupableId id                      superid             partOf  new ArrayListltGrouplt extends Groupablegtgt                   private ArrayListltGrouplt extends Groupablegtgt partOf          private final ArrayListltGrouplt extends Groupablegtgt containingGroups                        return partOf               codepre  pstrongProblemstrongbr The Generic type of partOf is what pains me. I need to return a list of groups of a type which extends Groupable of course, and indirectly supers the class this object is an instance of. A Mutation cannot be part of a list of Items of course.p  pIve considered using a type parameter in Groupable, but this does not seem correct to me.  That way you instantiate an Item which has its class as a type for its parent, which is possible but not nice. This way it is possible to return and store Groups of its own type but not Groups of supertype.p  pstrongFinallystrongbr I dont know if this is clear, I really dont know how to simplify the problem with preserving all elements.  p  pIf a brilliant problemsolving design exists which keeps in mind all these classes are meant to be extended and used in an as generic  manner possible, many thanks.  p  pIve read about just using raw type, but that doesnt seem right although it is already safe to assume no bad casting would happen. If someone can explain what Java does with this Genericnesting with wildcards and the correct way to solve this specific problem, again many thanks.p  pIm more interested in a correct way, or theoretical explanation than a workaround, dont have errors yet, because I dont know how to implement it.p

Negative 1249 pI am building mobile backend services. I was wondering, Imagine a service like Authentication Service provided App key ad App secret to people who buy a bunch of services  logically called an app .p  pLets assume there are services X , Y , Z , etc., and also a AuthService.p  pAssuming there is no concept of a User in the app,  I figured I can restrict API access of a service by using app key and app secret.p  pBut,p  pSince I cant validate codeappkey , appsecretcode locally because there as as good as codeusername , passwordcode , I have to make an AuthService servicecall to find out if the API call is valid. But this will affect performance as every call to a service X is actually itwoi service calls. p  pMy Question Are Apps validated at all, usually Why use appkey and appsecret, at all Why not have an biapp tokenib coming from the app which is self sufficient and I dont have to make an AuthService call. You could always use Https and avoid man in the middle, and have the app token stored securely by the SDK.p  pI heard about solutions like caching the app infoapptoken in services like X , Y , Z ... and verifying locally. But once you get hold of my app key and secret , you can party irrespective of where i store it, also caching would be redundant in individual services. You will end up storing the authorization information also, in the cache which can potentially change quickly. Cache Invalidation might be a problem. p  pPlease help, Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1249 pIm currently struggling with instantiating one class from multiple but identical assemblies during runtime. Heres my setupp  ul lipIve got a native executable that is able to load multiple DLLs at runtime.

After that an instance of the actual class from the target DLL will be created.pli lipTo be able to unload the target .Net DLL during runtime Ive implemented a pluginlike system based on a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles8832PluginManager relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles8832PluginManagera.br Short summary of it The DynamicLoader has two classes codeLocalLoadercode and codeRemoteLoadercode. An instance of codeLocalLoadercode is created in the root AppDomain which is created when the first CCLI DLL is loaded. This codeLocalLoadercode then creates a new target AppDomain and instantiates the codeRemoteLoadercode into it. This codeRemoteLoadercode will then load the target assembly and instanciates the target class.pli lipSo Ive got 2 AppDomains.

But with EF, I have to do 3 db calls.  This seems like overkill.p  pIs there any way around thisp  pPS  Im using EF 6.  I know I could generate an expression and make it single call..but that would still yield two subselects. p

Negative 1249 pI am working on a set of email templates which lets users add text, images, change font and colours, etc. Now if the user wants to add an image in a specific area of the template, they will first click on that area where they want the image to be added and then add an image from the library in my application. Now lets consider that the acceptable dimensions of the area they clicked on the template is 500  500, and the image selected from the library is 1000  1000, in such a case the application will automatically bring up a cropping tool using which they can resize the image. However, I want to restrict the cropping tool to only be draggable to the minimum height OR width of the desired location in the template, i.e., in this example, they should not be able to drag the cropping tool any further below the height OR width of 500, although they can keep one or both dimensions above 500 as the cropping tool automatically resizes it back to 500  500 for e.g. 800  500, or even 500  1000 is acceptable too as the cropping tool automatically resizes the image to fit in the template. I had a look at the a hrefhttpdeepliquid.comcontentJcropManual.html relnofollowdocumentationa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions346045jqueryjcrophowtosetafixedsizeselectionareathis questiona but couldnt really find a suitable answer to my question. Heres some of my code which validates if an image needs to be croppedp  precodevar SelectedAreaHeight returns the height of the area they clicked on the template var SelectedAreaWidth returns the width similarly  function ImageClickdata  var ReturnImageHeight returns the height of the area they clicked on var ReturnImageWidth returns the width similarly      .ResizeImage.eachfunction              ReturnImageHeight  this.dataheight         ReturnImageWidth  this.datawidth                if ReturnImageHeight gt SelectedAreaHeight  ReturnImageWidth gt SelectedAreaWidth              this checks if the selected images height OR width is greater         than the  desired area in the template to bring up the cropping tool.       codepre  pNow is there a way I could just restrict the cropping tool in a way that it is not cropable below codeSelectedAreaHeightcode OR codeSelectedAreaWidthcode  Also please ignore any problems with the sample code above as I havent pasted all of my code it does a lot more than just this.p

Negative 1249 pWhile thinking about the design of various applications I might like to build some day, in several cases I have had a need to emfan outem a stream of incoming events based on whether or not they match a large selection of full text search queries provided by users.p  pA simple example of this problem is the implementation of a tool like Twitter streaming search given many thousands of new tweets every second, efficiently select only the streaming subscribers whose search query is likely to match an incoming tweet.p  pA statement of the problem would be something like, inverse full text search, where the full text is the query, and the search results are the search queries that would match that text.p  pFor single term queries an implementation is obvious simply tokenize the incoming document, then search a map of termlist of subscribers, but things become more difficult when boolean queries are possible. In fact the problem is more general than full text search, but it is simplest understood in that context. There are many other examples where a large set of boolean terms need combined some way to optimize cost of evaluating them.p  pFor example, imagine 3 search subscriptionsp  ol liGoogle AND Glassli liGoogle AND Analyticsli liGlass AND Google NOT Knol OR Twitterli ol  pOne possibility is to parse the query into a tree, then visit each node, extracting the term, and using the map of term approach, however this would require reevaluating the subscribers query against the incoming document for each term. With enough subscribers, this is going to start getting slow very quickly.p  pInstead I am wondering if there is a well documented approach to rewrite the queries perhaps into a single query, where the result can be evaluated once, and tree nodes are annotated with a list of subscriber queries known to either exactly or almost certainly match any document that that point in the tree.p  pFor example, the above queries might be rewritten so that a map of termquery tree exists, such asp  pcodeGoogle gt Analytics[2]            Glass[1,3] Twitter gt [3] codep  pIs there any existing publicly documented system that does something like this Ideally the solution would allow incrementally adding and removing subscribers, without some expensive step to rewrite the entire structure.p

Negative 1249 pIn order to get more familiar with Swift I put together the start of a class designed to represent the needs and wants of a human game character. Right now it keeps track of a water and food variable. These variables are changed by functions that accept NSStrings or Strings, I have tried both and run that parameter through a switch statement.p  precodeimport Foundation  class human   var foodInt  0 var waterInt  0  func setFoodstrNSString      var genericString  The str filled your Food Hole with       switch str      case chicken         food  10         printlngeneric  10 points.     case bread         food  5         printlngeneric  5 points     case beans         food  10         printlngeneric  10 points     default         if food lt 30              food  2             printlnThat wasnt really food...Heres two pity points           else              printlnStop eating garbage                 func setWaterstrNSString      var genericString  The str filled your Water Hole with       switch str      case water         water  30         printlngeneric  30 points.     case mud water         water  10         printlngeneric  10 points. And youre gross.     case radioactive coolant         water  5         printlnOkay so that technically worked but wasnt a good idea     default         printlnDont put that in your mouth        codepre  pHere is the code for getting input from the consolep  precodevar hu  human  hu.setFoodbread printlnhu.food    this works fine  let keyboard  NSFileHandle.fileHandleWithStandardInput  while keyboard  printlnWhat do you eat or drink  var input  NSStringdata keyboard.availableData, encoding NSUTF8StringEncoding hu.setFoodinput  printlninput check input to confirm it even holds a string  codepre  pThe first codesetFoodcode function with the hardcoded string works fine. The correct case is matched, the variable is updated correctly, the text prints, etc. I have a codeprintlncode statement at the end there so that I can see what the codeinputcode variable actually holds and it does seem to hold some kind of String.p  pThe specific problem is that the switch statement always selects the default case when matching against input from the console. Inputting a valid string like codechickencode into the console will not match the chicken case of the switch statement. p  pIs this an encoding issue Ive tried NSString, String, Ive tried casting codeinputcode to a String, using a codelowercasecode method to see if that cleans things up. Ive looked through the library reference in Xcode for anything that might give me what I want without any luck. I am a beginner at Swift obviously and Ive never written any ObjectiveC. I hope Im not missing something obvious. Thanks.p

Negative 1249 pI would like to add an inapp purchase with downloadable content hosted on Apple servers to my app. This purchase with its content will be updated with every new version of the app. The updated purchase will work only with the latest app version. In this case the owner of the older version will be able to purchase and download the new version content. How can I resolve the issuep  pI see that an array of codeSKDownloadcode is available in codeSKPaymentTransactioncode. Does it mean that all inapp purchase versions will be available for the app In this case it would be enough to download only the version compatible with the app.p  pAnother variant is to link a purchase version to an app version.

Negative 1249 pIm currently developping a client server game and im facing some problem when im sending my  ArrayList via a socket.

So in my player class i got 2 read object, player and enemies. In my server i have 2 write, player and enemies. My main problem is that when the server is sending the ArrayList of players to the 2 connected player it show me that the size of the ArrayList is 2 which is normal, here is the log p  precode[1112] 2 to 15 [1112] 2 to 16 [1112] 2 to 15 [1112] 2 to 16 [1112] 2 to 15 [1112] 2 to 16 codepre  pWe can also see that it send it to 2 different id the connected players. Now this is what i get when i do this p  precodeArrayListltPlayergt p  ArrayListltPlayergt this.objIn.readObject System.out.printlnp.size codepre  pFor the first connected player i have 1 in size and the second one i have 2. That basicly mean the one player is lost in the transaction. If i add another player so it makes 3, the same thing happen, the first player connected will have an ArrayList with a size of 1, the second one a size of 2 and the last one a size of 3. Here is my sendObject code p  precode    ifthis.players.size gt 0          forGestionPlayer gp  this.players              gp.sendPlayerthis.level.players               codepre  pAnd the sendPlayer method  p  precodepublic void sendPlayerArrayListltPlayergt players      try          this.objectOut.writeObjectplayers      catch IOException e          e.printStackTrace       codepre  pDo you guys know if im doing something wrong p  pThanks p  pPS  Im aware that sending Object with socket is not realy good better to send raw data, but i dont want to argue that here.p

Negative 1249 pIm developing a website on .NET 4.0 MVC4 with a strongMySQL databasestrong, and I was getting this Property cannot be set to a null value error. p  pDescriptionp  pI have several tables in a MySQL database, and most of them contain nullable properties most of them strings. Then, in my .NET project, I have my .edmx file, which I created using the wizard, so that file was made automatically, from the database I already had. p  pBut while I was testing, I got this error I already mentioned. So I did a little reaserch and i found out that the problem was thisp  precodepropertyName  StructuralObject.SetValidValuevalue, false  codepre  pThat line, it verifies that the value of the property is not null, even though the Nullable checkbox was checked on the database client HeidiSQL in my case. The temporary solution that i found is that if I change false for true in that line, it works. It looks like thisp  precodepropertyName  StructuralObject.SetValidValuevalue, true codepre  pThe problem is that I have lots of nullable properties in different tables, I need to find a way to make the EntityFramework understand that i want those properties to allow null as a value, without having to search for every field in my Designer and change it manually.p

Negative 1249 pWhen performing calculations on large numbers, how does one properly output the result in the right String format for the end user to see Ive tried the different format specifiers for NSString and compared the results to what the iOS Calculator app shows and some of the results arent the same. Ideally it would match the iOS Calculator results exactly.p  pI know it needs to be displayed in decimal format until the number is sufficiently large, and at that point it needs to be shown in scientific notation. Therefore I thought codegcode was the right specifier. But it doesnt match the builtin calculator for the same calculation.p  pcode[NSString stringWithFormatg, calcResult] where calcResult is a doublecodep  pSome examplesbr 123456.7  1 should display as 123456.7 but it is displayed as 123457 puzzlingbr 123456789  1 should display as 123456789 but its displayed as 1.23457e08br 123456789  123456789 should display as 1.524158e16 but its displayed as 1.52416e16p  pAlso, how does one get the comma or period depending on locale to appear in the result Are there additional specifiers one can use to get the exact format the iOS Calculator showsp

Negative 1249 pI am trying to create a deep copy of a rather complex data structure. It has lots of children and variables that all need to be serializable. Ive done my best to mark all the classes I know need to be serializable and I have worked through countless codejava.io.NotSerializableExceptioncode errors and have been able to find the culprit by searching for imports with the same package paths.p  pNow Im at an error I cannot find the source to.p  precodeException in ObjectCloner  java.io.NotSerializableException sun.awt.SunHintsValue codepre  pI cannot find the class that included codesun.awt.SunHintscode.

Negative 1249 pIm writing some numerical code that uses classes for the elements of the finite element model.

What I need to know is this...p  pIf I add a printer setup menu, which will be used to display a print dialog and allow the user to select a specific printer for a specific option ex one printer for receipts, one printer for reports, etc. and the user can select the same printer for all options, if desired, how can I save the users printer choice and access that laterp  pFor example, I might choose to print a receipt when the user finishes entering a transaction and clicks Save. The printer that the document is sent to should be the printer that is chosen in the printer set up menu. How can I design my application in a way that will allow thisp  pAs always, thank you in advance for any helpful answers.p
Negative 1249 pHere is what Im trying to achieve.p  pIm streaming from a Logitech C920 camera on beaglebone black with gstreamer.

Negative 1249 pI want to begin rewriting step by step a data access layer in an old application. We use the Entity Framework as object relational mapper, so the pure data access is already done. What still needs to be done is providing the next layer I call it that because its not clear right now if the old business layer is going to stay at all this might lead to the question where the methods Im talking about should go, layerwise with the necessary methods to get the data it needs.p  pSince there will be many methods needed, putting them all in one huge interfaceclass didnt seem the right way of doing it to me. I rather think of separating these getting data methods thematically. That is, something like thisp  precodeinterface IBillDataAccess  ..  interface IAttestationDataAccess  ..  interface ICustomerDataAccess  ..  codepre  pand so on.p  p1 Do you think it is useful here to use interfaces at all I think so, even when the implementation of those is not likely going to change Id have to add new methods to both the interface and implementation.p  p2 I would usually accumulate the creation of the concrete implementation of these interfaces inside a provider class, as I have seen in many of our smaller projects before. It usually looks like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26354722whatkindofpatternisthisprovidersimilar old question of minea, but now I have way more interfacesp  precodepublic static class DataAccessProvider    public static ICustomerDataAccess GetCustomerDataAccess        return new CustomerDataAccess       public static IBillDataAccess GetBillDataAccess        return new BillDataAccess       and so on  codepre  pSomething about this design is bothering me, though I cannot put my finger on it. Im sure your opinions will help me out herep  pAnother point intersects with 1 Im not yet sure if I like the codeDataAccesscode classes not being static. But having static classes for this would mean I cant use any interface.p  pI appreciate any input on this as Im really quite insecure about all this, and unfortunately the people Id usually ask are not here for the time being. Feel free to doubt and criticize anything I did in the above p

hrefhttpsgithub.commbestknockoutdeferredupdates relnofollowknockoutdeferredupdatesa plugin, however if I include it, any validation messages are not cleared when the model state is reverted.p  pI

Negative 1249 pI have a model named User where I store the name and the approximate latitudelongitude data where each user lives. Plus, I also hold a list of text locations obtained using reverse geocoding e.g. [Baltimore, Maryland, EEUU].p  pId like to get users from the mobile app, using cursors, sorted by namelocation. Lets say I send Jonh to the server. Then, my idea is to retrieve data from the datastore so that all the users whose name begins with John e.g. John Doe and live closer to me are rendered first.p  pSo far my query doesnt consider the location perspective and is as followsp  pqry  User.queryUser.Name  givenusername.orderUser.Namep  pI think one alternative would consist in using the Python Search API. If Im correct, then I must first generate a search document, structure data using fields, index the document and, finally, use the mentioned API.p  pDo you think this is the way to go I feel like there is simpler way to address this question. For example, using the list of stored text locations could help, but in this case I wouldve to manually sort, because of the query limitations of GAE, and query to the datastore several times to get all the data.p

Negative 1249 pI have a large avro file whose format is similar to a sequencefile. That is, each record within the avro file has two fields 1 a filename and 2 a binary representation of that file.

Negative 1249 pIm building an API that needs to connect to a different database per request. Currently Im using EF. These databases all have the same schema, therefore I can share a DbContext class. I have repositories to abstract persistence, and these are the ones using the DbContext objects.p  pUnity is handling dependency resolution, it is injecting my repositories with DbContext objects, and the repos on the controllers. Basically with zero configuration. I understand that probably I may need to create my own HttpRequestLifeCycle thing as suggested in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5187562mvcefdatacontextsingletoninstanceperwebrequestinunitythis answera to make sure I have the same DbContext object through out the request. p  pNow, I would like to configure a ConnectionString to be used by Unity when creating DbContext objects to pass along to the repositories.p  pThese ConnectionString will come from a repository most likely a different fixed database, based on a parameter on my route.

Negative 1249 pNow I try to write RTOS by my self. I have a question in RTOS concept, we have context switch theory.  From what I know, context switch is to describe that when some task is running and the other task has a higher priority, the higher priority task will run and the current task will be saved its state and continue to start after the higher task finish. To do this concept, I think the higher priority task will run in the interrupt functions since the interrupt functions have higher priority than other instruction, am I right. If i am right, so i do not need to write code to save the current tasks state, since as i know that after interrupt, the program will return to where it is interrupted. If I am wrong, how can I save the current task s state Is it necessary to write assembly code to do that since I see halogen generate an assembly code file to do this for FreeRTOSp

Negative 1249 pI am going to use kafka in a very high traffic environment of more than a billion requests per day. Every request will make a connection to kafka cluster to send message. So there will be so many connections being made continuously every second. This could cause issues like socket timeouts. producer is making all the nonpersistent connections. So in such case there could be socket timeout or port exhaustion issues.p  pMost ecosystem is in php, so I have to use php library for kafka. Now how to effectively use kafka producer to mitigate this connection contentionp  pI thought of a daemon process which can be fed messages and it will then send these messages in batch to kafka cluster. Plus side is that there can be limited number of connections. Down side is that response latency of such service will hamper the application.

Negative 1249 pFirstly, my apologies should this not be the correct forum for this question. I am trying to implement two tcp congestion control algorithms in OMNeTINET for my thesis.p  pThe first one is TCPFIT, for which I have found pseudocode at a hrefhttpwww.tcpengines.comwpcontentuploads201311tcpwhitepaper.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.tcpengines.comwpcontentuploads201311tcpwhitepaper.pdfa. The other one is TCPIllinois, of which I have found a linux implementation at a hrefhttplxr.freeelectrons.comsourcenetipv4tcpillinois.c relnofollowhttplxr.freeelectrons.comsourcenetipv4tcpillinois.ca.p  pI cannot understand how to implement a few variables and methods in both mechanisms, and I would appreciate your help in figuring them out. A bit of help with the variable types would be welcome, as well.p  pIn brief, for TCPFITp  ul liemepochstartem and emupdateepochem I understand that epoch can be synonymous with RTTli liemalphaem valueli liemnem  what is itli liIs the RTTcnt calculation correct  under receivedDataAck li liIs the tcpFitUpdateN function correctli liHave I implemented the pseudocode rightli ul  pFor TCPIllinoisp  ul liemsndcwndcntem  I think this is just a counter of how many packets have been ACKED.li liemsndcwndclampem  Top limit of congestion window, I think I have it right.li liemendseqem  it seems to be needed, but I do not understand the ack parameter in emif afterack, caendseq ...em, which comes from the function emtcpillinoiscongavoidstruct sock sk, u32 ack, u32 acked ...emli liemtpsndnxtem  is it equivalent to OMNeT statesndnxtli liemsumrttem and emmaxrttem  Do I calculate these values rightli ul  pTo my understanding, after reading the paper provided in the linux implementation, TCPIllinois is functioning in the same manner as TCPNewReno except the AIMD part. I bet this means I can keep most of the code of TCPNewReno intact, except the TCPSACK part and AIMD.p  pI would also appreciate any hints on the implementation and, of course, any comments on the correctness of the code. My current and almost complete implementation can be found on github, at a hrefhttpsgithub.comSpyrosMArtelTCPFitIllinois relnofollowhttpsgithub.comSpyrosMArtelTCPFitIllinoisa.p  pShould you need more details or clarifications, feel free to bother me.p  pThank you in advance.p

The repository has around 23000 commits in it, and this has stopped on me maybe 20 times so far.

What Im trying to figure out isp  pIs there a way to automatically ignore the error and move on  This import has been running for 3 days now, and Id like to be able to run it without babysitting it as much. Is there a way to actually resolve the error properly  I think it has something to do with the tag name, but changing the tag in SVN just generates a new commit, and therefore doesnt fix the history.  Im fine if the solution is to permanently delete the tag from the old respoitory, I just need a way to erase it from the history.  p  pIm currently trying a second import with all the branches and none of the tags, and then manually converting the tags I need to reference particular commits, but if theres a way to import these cleanly, then Id rather use it.  p

Negative 1249 pI have a php script file that takes information from a form and places it into a sql database, after the script finishes I force the browser to be redirected to another web page. p  pWhen running this script locally, it works as it should.. taking the information putting it into the database and redirecting to aboutus.html. However on my server, it also does what it is supposed to do by taking the typed in information and inserting it into the database, but instead of the browser being redirected, it brings up a plain white page with the words p  precodeThe page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred. codepre  pNo error number nothing.

Negative 1249 pOk, somewhat similar questions have been asked, but there is no answer that has made any difference in solving my problem. Ive tried Thread.sleep, and also the delayed runnable. Using a Handler, etc. p  pI want to display a sequence of frame animationsAnimationDrawable using the same imageview and changing the background animations as needed. The user inputs a series of 5 animations and can then play them backif my program worked. Once the animations are selected I use a for loop that contains if statements and a switch statement to select that whatever animations were chosen and play them back.p  pAs you might imagine, this doesnt work correctly, as the program whips through the for loop and only the first and last animation actually play. Here is the jist of the codep  precodefori0ilt5i     ifconditions         view.setBackgroundchosenAnimation         AnimationDrawableview.getBackground.start       codepre  pSo as I said, I have tried Thread.sleep, that doesnt do what Im looking for.  I have tried using the Handler class and putting a delay on the runnable. I have tried this p  precodeview.postDelayednew Runnable      Override      public void run          works the same without this line         AnimationDrawableview.getBackground.stop         AnimationDrawableview.getBackground.start      , 1000 codepre  pNone of these things do anything at all except add pauses before it does the exact same thing it did before I added this stuff. I have meticulously debugged the code and everything is working correctly. The animations have all been individually tested.p  pAs I said, similar questions have been asked and answered and nothing offered does what I want, which is for emthe program to wait until one  animation is finished before it runs through the for loop again.emp  pId like to state again that this is a series of frame animations using AnimationDrawable and the same imageview each time.

A possible state 1 3 4 2 for example means that in row 1 queen is in column 1, in row 2 queen is in column 3 and so on. p  pI think I am doing something wrong though because the compiler dont like my loops. The error Im getting is something like Loop keyword expected in...p  pHere is the codep  precodeloop for i in 1 2 3 4    nconc loop for j in 1 2 3 4                nconc loop for k in 1 2 3 4                            nconc loop for l in 1 2 3 4                                         defvar first 0                                      defvar second 0                                      defvar third 0                                      defvar fourth 0                                      setq first abs  1 i                                      setq second abs  2 j                                      setq third abs  3 k                                      setq fourth abs  4 l                                      if and not eq first second not eq first third not eq first fourth not eq second third                                                  not eq second fourth not eq first second not eq third fourth                                            if and or eq i j eq i k eq i l eq j k eq j l or eq k l                                                print i j k l codepre  pPlease help me out with the nested loops and feel free to comment on my code and possibly suggest better ways of solving this problem.

Negative 1249 pIm a C newbie learning how to work with arrays. I wrote a small console app that converts binary numbers to their decimal equivalents however, the sytax Ive used seems to be causing the app to  at some point  use the unicode designation of integers instead of the true value of the integer itself, so 1 becomes 49, and 0 becomes 48.p  pHow can I write the app differently to avoid this Thanksp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks  namespace Sandbox      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      Console.WriteLineKey in binary number and press Enter to calculate decimal equivalent             string inputString  Console.ReadLine              This is supposed to change the user input into character array   possible issue here             char[] digitalState  inputString.ToArray               int exponent  0             int numberBase  2              int digitIndex  inputString.Length  1             int decimalValue  0             int intermediateValue  0              Calculates the decimal value of each binary digit by raising two to the power of the position of the digit.

Negative 1249 pLately, Ive noticed javascript convention has been shifting. Now, wherever I look, I see other developers using javascript are wrapping their functions in parenthesis to make it private or something like that Im not sure, javascript is a secondary language for me. For example...p  precodefunction something       something happens here       codepre  pAs stuff especially additional functions gets nested, this hurts code readability, and is really making javascript ugly and look more and more like the nightmares of programming in LISPhow it got its nickname Lots of Idiotic Single Parentheses. I dont care if I have to type out a full word or even a couple words to get the same effect. Is there a good alternative to encapsulating in parentheses to make a function private and get the other benefits of the parenthetical encapsulationp  pEdit Apparently I misunderstood the point of the outside surrounding parenthesis that Im questioning. Which makes me more confused about their purpose, actually.p

Negative 1249 pI am new to AngularJS. Another developer put together our eCommerce platform using AngularJS as part of the solution. We have AngularJS built modal overlays and I am converting all our AngularJS alert to use the modal.p  pSo far, so good, except the final alert  one that is triggered when the logged in user session times out. We are using a hrefhttpadamalbrecht.com20131212creatingasimplemodaldialogdirectiveinangularjs relnofollowhttpadamalbrecht.com20131212creatingasimplemodaldialogdirectiveinangularjsa to build our modal directive but I cant get this to work without user input  these modals are all triggered by users clicking buttons and inputs but this is not triggered by a user action. Everything Ive tried has resulted in ReferenceError scope is not definedp  pI would like to share the code but it is owned by the company so I cant share it. Just wondering if anyone out there has put together an AngularJS modal that triggers when the user log in session timesout to tell them they need to log back in.p  pThanks.p
