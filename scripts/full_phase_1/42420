Positive 42420 pI have a project that I am working on that uses a NativeActivity, along with the androidnativeappglue files to connect to the Java side.

Positive 42420 pAfter spending hours and hours searching for a solution to my problem and browsing the various forums including this one i finally decided to ask my question, hoping that it has not been fully answered elsewhere.p  pIm trying to build a pretty complex architecture p  ul liI have C sources that i compile in separates static libraries .a li liI use them via JNI in a module Libraryli liI want to use this library in an app project.li ul  pI first successfully did the following tests  I already managed to make a module library without NDK and compile it with the app.  I also managed to use the static libraries and JNI directly in the app butp  pI am failing with the following step   The combination of JNI inside the module and app calling the classes of the module doesnt work.p  pI think the problem is with the include of the aar, because I cant find the explodedaar in the build directory of my app while the aar is in the library buildoutputs directory. Besides, all the previous tests including the use of  JNI were successful.p  pIm not using the experimental model because it is experimental and there are known limitations with static libraries.p  pThe structure of my project is p  precode App      src          main              java                  activity    bar      src          main              java                  class              jni                  include                      .h                  libs                      abis...                          libmod1.a                          libmod2.a                 Android.mk                 Application.mk                 bar.c                 bar.h codepre  pThe app build.gradle looks like this p  precodeapply plugin com.android.application  android      compileSdkVersion 23     buildToolsVersion 23.0.0      defaultConfig          applicationId com.test.foo         minSdkVersion 10         targetSdkVersion 23         versionCode 1         versionName 1.0           buildTypes           release              debuggable          false             jniDebuggable       false             minifyEnabled       false                  unsigned              debuggable          false             jniDebuggable       false             minifyEnabled       false                  debug              debuggable          true             jniDebuggable       true             minifyEnabled       false                     productFlavors          x86              ndk                  abiFilter x86                               mips              ndk                  abiFilter mips                               armv7              ndk                  abiFilter armeabiv7a                               arm              ndk                  abiFilter armeabi                               fat           project.ext.versionCodes  [armeabi1, armeabiv7a2, arm64v8a3, mips5, mips646, x868, x86649]      android.applicationVariants.all  variant gt         variant.outputs.each  output gt             output.versionCodeOverride                      project.ext.versionCodes.getoutput.getFiltercom.android.build.OutputFile.ABI, 0  1000000  defaultConfig.versionCode                 dependencies      compile fileTreedir libs, include [.jar,.aar]     compile project bar   codepre  pThe module build.gradle looks like this p  precodeapply plugin com.android.library  android      compileSdkVersion 23     buildToolsVersion 23.0.0      defaultConfig          minSdkVersion 10         targetSdkVersion 23         versionCode 1         versionName 1.0          ndk              moduleName module                   buildTypes           release              debuggable      false             jniDebuggable   false             minifyEnabled   false                  unsigned              debuggable      false             jniDebuggable   false             minifyEnabled   false                  debug              debuggable      true             jniDebuggable   true             minifyEnabled   false                    productFlavors          x86              ndk                  abiFilter x86                               mips              ndk                  abiFilter mips                               armv7              ndk                  abiFilter armeabiv7a                               arm              ndk                  abiFilter armeabi                               fat          sourceSets.main          jniLibs.srcDir srcmainlibs         jni.srcDirs      []           task ndkBuildtype Exec          commandLine android.ndkDirectory.getAbsolutePathndkbuild, C, filesrcmain.absolutePath           tasks.withTypeJavaCompile          compileTask gt compileTask.dependsOn ndkBuild        dependencies      compile fileTreedir libs, include [.jar]  codepre  pMy Android.mk inside the module jni directory is      LOCALPATH call mydirp  precode Mod1 include CLEARVARS LOCALMODULE             mod1 LOCALSRCFILES          libsTARGETARCHABIlibmod1.a include PREBUILTSTATICLIBRARY   Mod2 include CLEARVARS LOCALMODULE             pxnav LOCALSRCFILES          libsTARGETARCHABIlibmod2.a LOCALSTATICLIBRARIES   pxfd include PREBUILTSTATICLIBRARY   Parser include CLEARVARS LOCALMODULE             module LOCALCINCLUDES         LOCALPATHinclude LOCALLDLIBS             landroid llog LOCALSRCFILES          bar.c LOCALSTATICLIBRARIES   mod1 mod2 include BUILDSHAREDLIBRARY codepre
Positive 42420 pI want to write a simple Hello World GUI not CLI app in C and run it on my Android device. I tried the HelloJNI sample from Android NDK package, but it also uses some Java code and I want to do it in pure C way, without JNI. Is it even possible or do I emhave toem use some Java wrapperp  pIt would be nice to do it the old way  without Eclipse, just a C code file  makefile.p
Positive 42420 pIve written a bunch of android JNI code that I want to make into a library for a customer.  Obviously, I dont want the customer to be able to see my JNI code.  Is there a way I can include just the so file in a library project for themp  pIve tried just using codeSystem.loadLibraryltlibrarygtcode but I get an Unsatisfied Link Error every time.p  pOne thing thats worked, is Ive just compiled my project and deleted all the c files.  Im still able to use the .so file, but if I do a make clean, it deletes my so file and theres no way to recover it without the source.p  pIn short, what I want is to be able to compile an so file on my own, and give it to my customer with some java code that interfaces with it.  I dont care if they see the java wrapper source but I dont want them to be able to see the JNI code.  I also want them to be able to treat this library as they would any other ie make cleans dont wreck it.p  pThanks p

Positive 42420 pWe have a strange problem with our Android app. In Fabric we have a very infrequent crash. It is a standard UnsatisfiedLinkError meaning that in the static initializer of the Java class, the .so library fails to load. This is what we have found out so farp  ul lipThe problem is very rare. It happens in a couple of hundred devices out of hundreds of thousands or of installations.pli lipOnce it happens, it seems like restarting or even reinstallationdoes not solve it.pli lipIt happens across various brands like Sony, Samsung, Huawei.pli lipIt happens across all Android versions from 2.3 to 5.x.pli lipWe managed to catch it once in the office on a Nexus 1 device. When it started to happen, it always failed in the LoadLibrary call even though the same apk worked just fine on other devices.pli lipWhen the problem happened, I removed the armv7a and x86 versions of the lib and only left the armeabi one to rule out the wrong lib was loaded, it still failed. Rerunning the app through Android studio several times adding logs still caused the failure in the same place.pli lipThen all of a sudden, without no obvious change, it started to work in the Nexus 1 and even after dozens of retries, we can not reproduce the problem again. The only thing that happened before it started to work was that I tried to manually install a corrupt apk with adb install which failed and the next time I loaded the app through Android studio, it worked and has worked even since. I am not sure if the failed installation of the corrupt apk somehow cleaned something out or if it was just a coincidence.pli lipThe thing I failed to do was to check that the armeabi .so file was actually present in the lib folder on the device when the failure occurred. I only came to think about this after it had already started to work.pli ul  pSo, to sum up. The apk is perfectly fine but and installs fine from Android studio the Play store on 99,9 of the devices but then under certain conditions which are very rare, the LoadLibrary fails and when it does, there seems to be no obvious fix, not even reinstalling solved it but as I explained, something finally changed and when it started working on the Nexus 1, it has continued to work ever since.p  pThis problem is really tricky since we have no way of reproduce it right now and we know it is affecting at least a small group of our users.p  pAny suggestions on how to narrow this down are welcome.p

Positive 42420 pI am a Java web developer I, essentially, write JSP applications. My most comfortable environment is Linux, but I do Ok on Windows. I know very little about Android app development, and I know nothing about C.p  pI have recently been tasked with writing an Android app. The Android app, itself, isnt that daunting, but here is where it gets complicated. The company has a couple of preexisting widgets written in C that they want me to include into the Android app. Currently they are standalone Windows applications, but I have the source code.p  pWhat I need to know is, can I use the Android NDK to utilize the C code in my Android app Can I use this preexisting C code in my Android app and call the functions like I do classes in java Can I then compile the whole kit and caboodle into a single Android app with all functionalities of my original code, and the preexisting widgetsp  pLike I said, I know nothing about C, so I have no idea where to even get started. I have done some reading on the Android NDK, but since I have no C experience, and strongverystrong little Android experience  just some tutorials on a hrefhttpdeveloper.google.com relnofollowhttpdeveloper.google.coma , I dont even know which files I should import into the project.p  pThanksp

Then I need exactly one instance of Server. strongWould it then be a huge OO crime to use static methods instead of a singletonestrongp  precodeinterface Server      Session findByUserString user   class ServerImpl implements Server      public Session findByUserString user     class Session     public SessionServer server, Socket socket    codepre  pGood point on the codeattach...code method  Ive never even considered subclassing codeSessioncode class, thats probably why I havent thought how risy it might be to call public method in the constructor. But then I actually need some public method to attach session to a different socket, so maybe a pair of methodsp  precodeclass Session      public SessionSocket socket         attachsocketsocket           public void attachSocket socket          attachsocketsocket           private void attachsocketSocket socket           ...       codepre  pIts true that allowing clients of Session to call codeattach...code doesnt seem right. Thats probably one of those serious mehods only the Server should have access to. How do I do it without Cs friendship relationship though Somehow inner classes came to my mind, but I havent given it much thought, so it maybe a completely wrong path.p  pEverytime I receive a new connection I spawn a new thread and create a new Session instance associated with it to handle transmission. That way while the user sends in a login command, Server is ready to accept new connections. Once the users identity is verified, I check if by any chance hes not already logged in has another ongoing session. If he is then I strongdetach the onging session from its socket, close that socket, attach the ongoing session to current socket and close current sessionstrong. Hope this is more clear explanation of what actually happens Maybe the use of a word emsessionem is a bit misfortunate here. What I really have is 4 different objects created for each connection and 3 threads socket handler, message sender, message receiver and a session if its a good solution thats a different question.... I just tried simplyfing the source code to focus on the question.p  pI totally agree it makes no sense to iterate over session list when you can use a map. But Im afraid thats probably one of the smaller issues believe me the code Im working on suffers from. I shouldve mentioned its actually some legacy system that, no surprise, quite recently has been discoved to have some  concurrency and performance issues. My task is to fix it... Not an easy task when you pretty much got only theoretical knowledge on multithreading or when you merely used it to display a progress bar.p  pIf after this, rather lengthy, clarification you have some more insight on the architecture, Id be more than willing to listen.p

Negative 42420 pIm working on an app to provide an easy way for people to track the status of a bill [and various other political information].  I love the idea of OpenCongress, for instance, which surfaces summary information on legislation as it navigates the political process, but Id like it if it had a tagbased search system and some other rich search options, as well as more conveniently accessible voting history and term information.  And while they now have JavaScript widgets which show the current status of bills you select, I think more could be done in this regard.p  pI dont know where they get their data, though, and while they have an API of their own, I dont know whether sticking a wart onto it is the best way of implementing what I envision.

Negative 42420 pI have a number of data sets that have keyvalue pattern  i.e. a string key and a pointer to the data. Right now it is stored in hashtables, each table having array of slots corresponding to hash keys, and on collision forming a linked list under each slot that has collision direct chaining. All implemented in C and should stay in C if it matters.p  pNow, the data is actually 3 slightly different types of data setsp  ol liSome sets can be changed keys added, removed, replaced, etc. at willli liFor some sets data can be added but almost never replacedremoved i.e. it can happen, but in practice it is very rareli liFor some sets the data is added once and then only looked up, it is never changed once the whole set is loaded. li ol  pAll sets of course have to support lookups as fast as possible, and consume minimal amounts of memory though lookup speed is more important than size. p  pSo the question is  is there some better hashtable structureimplementation that would suit the specific cases better I suspect for the first case the chaining is the best, but not sure about two other cases.  p

Negative 42420 pI have big, fat and ugly legacy program. One task I had to accomplish was adding a new class to strongproject Astrong. strongProject Bstrong references strongproject Astrong, but the functionality I need to add depends on a method of a class in strongproject Bstrong. Of course, I cant reference strongproject Bstrong from strongAstrong, because that would create a circular reference. In a similar situation, my approach was to create strongproject Cstrong and move the dependencies from strongAstrong and strongBstrong into it, and have both strongAstrong and strongBstrong reference it. p  pBut, for this particular task it would require moving so much code that it would create a huge mess in the solution.p  pFor now, Im passing the instance of that needed class boxed in an codeobjectcode and using reflection to access the method I need at runtime.p  pIs there any other better way to solve this without moving code to a project Cp

Negative 42420 h3The setuph3  pIn Interface Builder 3.2.5, when you set a key equivalent for a menu item using a character that is typed using a shift key e.g. the question mark, the key equivalent is set to the unshifted character on the same key with the shift modifier as part of the key equiv. For example, trying to set the key equiv. to CommandQuestion Mark sets it as CommandShiftForward Slash. p  pThe various system U.S. and Dvorak layouts, the Unicode Hex Input, British and Canadian English layouts and my custom Dvorak layout all exhibit this behavior.p  h3The questionh3  pHow can an equiv be easily set to a character requiring use of a shift key without including the shift modifier as part of the equiv p  h3The workaroundsh3  pIt could be done by switching to a keyboard layout where you can type the desired character without using shift. It could also be done by editing the nib file containing the menu. However, neither of these has the level of ease I desire. It could be done programmatically, but for the purposes of this question Im only interested in how it could be done in IB.p  phr So far, the Apple docs and web searches have turned up naught.

Negative 42420 pThe way that SQL server seems to be optimising a query is causing it to break.  This is illustrated with the two examples belowp  precodeSELECT distinct ET.ElementName, ET.Shared, CONVERTfloat,ED.Value, ED.SheetSetVersionID, ED.SheetDataID FROM tElementData ED  INNER JOIN tElementTemplate ET  ON ED.ElementTemplateID  ET.ElementTemplateID  AND ET.ElementName like RPODCQRated codepre  pThe above query works fine but is not the query I need to run.p  precodeSELECT distinct ET.ElementName, ET.Shared, CONVERTfloat,ED.Value,    ED.SheetSetVersionID, ED.SheetDataID FROM tElementData ED  INNER JOIN tElementTemplate ET  ON ED.ElementTemplateID  ET.ElementTemplateID  AND ET.ElementName like RPODCQRated AND CONVERTfloat,ED.Value  0.006388 codepre  pThe above query throws an exception saying that it cannot convert an nvarchar value to a float.  tElementData.Value is an nvarchar500 field and some records do have none numeric values but all values where tElementTemplate  RPODCQRated can be converted to a float, as the top query proves.  It seems that SQL server in its wisdom is applying the CONVERTfloat,ED.Value before it tries the join.  I need the second query to work somehow, I can rewrite it but there are limitations on what I can do without rewriting the entire data layer of an existing application.p  pThings i have tried that dont help moving the last criteria into a where clause rather that the join, making the first query into a CTE and applying the where clause to the CTE, creating a scalar function that calls IsNumeric on the data before trying to do a convert.p  pThe only thin i could get to work was to insert all the data in a temporary table then apply a where clause to the temporary table.  Unfortunately to implement this as a solution would involve extensive refactoring of the data layer of an application in order to solve an obscure bug when searching for certain records.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 42420 pI have a data driven unit test that uses a CSV file for its data source.  One of the columns in my file is meant to be treated as a string.  It works fine until I add a line where the value for that column can be interpreted as a date.  When I do this, the tests for the earlier lines start to fail.  It appears that having a date in the column makes it treat all values in the columns as dates.  Values that cant be parsed as a date are then given a DBNull value. Is there anyway to prevent this  Maybe by specifying what type each column in my data source should be treated asp

Negative 42420 pwonder if I could get some advice on the best way to solve this authentication problem.p  pI have a store web application, due to the nature of the store, any user must be authenticated in order to view or use it. Access to the store for all users is through a single login form.p  pThere are 4 levels of user, superuser me, store manager, store worker, and customer.p  pMy problem is what type of authentication to use for each type of user, should it be email based or based on some kind of usernamep  pA store manager will come to our site, and create a new store, and I am happy that they should use an email address and password for authentication. The store manager will then create accounts for store workers and customers. For customers, again, I am happy for them to authenticate with an email address and password. But what should I use for store workers I dont think its appropriate for them to use their personal email address for an account that will be purely professional, what do you think In addition, I can foresee that the manager may create a single worker account, leave it logged in, and all workers will use this one account, so again, an email address would be inappropriate.p  pso these are the solutions I can think of, but all have problemsp  pThe store manager creates store worker accounts that have a username and password. Problem with this is that because all access to the site is through a single login, they could spend ages trying to find a username that has not already been taken.p  pWhen a store worker is created they are assigned a unique login id, e.g 0002014, and together with a password, this can be used to authenticate. Problem with this is that the login id would be hard to remember.p  pI also considered having a username that is somehow combined with the store name which is unique but couldnt think of an elegant way to make it work, it couldnt look like an email address for example.p  pAnyone have a preference on the above or hopefully can suggest a better solution. Thanks for reading.p

Negative 42420 pI have a rails app I am working on that allows users to create a schedule.  In doing so, they should be able to select on which days of the week an event occurs.

Negative 42420 pI am building an app that uses Cocos2d to create a map of content technically a big Tree in the graph theory sense.  Each node is represented by a sprite with its own texture, with the leaf nodes all having a second button pressed texture.  In addition, some of the nodes are PNG animations.  I have one sprite sheet containing the 130 or so node textures, and 3 other sprite sheets for the animations.  All in all those 4 files add up to only about 18.4 MB.p  pIf I run the app and DONT run the cocos2d part i.e. Never launch the framework at all and therefore never load the textures the app runs at around 10 MB.  When I load Cocos2d and those sprite sheets, the memory shoots up past 90 MB.p  pAll my research seems to say I am doing things in the most efficient way possible, but with the memory usage already so high I get a lot of memory related crashes on iPad 1.p  pIs this normal for cocos2d  Since the images themselves arent so large, is it using so much memory because of the number of sprites  Are there ways to bring the memory footprint down  I am at a loss, and very much under the gun...p

Negative 42420 pI have a table where one field is titled secure password.  In this field there is an input button that calls an ajax function that updates a password and then updates the dom element value.p  pOn this same page I have another function which uses javascript to parse through all elements in the table into an array.  The problem is the javascript function is writing was was originally in the secure password field rather than what the ajax function has updated it to.p  pIt seems as though javascript does not pull the current dom value but the dom value when the page was loaded.  Is this the default nature of javascript and if so how can I get around this so I can get the current values for all fields in the table, not just the page load values.p  pThis script is written in PHPJavascript, thanks in advance for the assistance.p

Negative 42420 pI have a question regarding the local variables for my jQuery plugin.

Negative 42420 pI am working on refactoring a large mostly Perl codebase. Rather that put everything into one giant git repository, Id like to group related modules and their tests into separate git repositories, and to have the repositories structured like CPAN distributions.p  pOne problem is that if each repository has a distinct CPAN distribution tree, then it seems awkward to use submodules, since for testing purposes what we really want is to include each submodules lib in the tests.  This is a minor issue, and I am already aware of various easy workarounds use lib... in tests, but I would like to know what other developers do in similar situations, and what are considered best practices.p  pA more important issue is how to deal with branching. If a new branch of the submodule is created, and then the branch is updated, how can I test the code in the superrepositories that depend on it for emthat branchem I may not necessarily want to make changes to the superrepositories, just check that changes to the submodule didnt break anything.p  pOn a similar note, are there utilities that can track dependencies between git repositories, so that I can determine which superrepositories need testing for a branch after changes to a dependencyp

This is unpredictable though  if I set it to codecode for other rowes, it missizes again. Im doing this coding from automation, so I wont be able to predict a problematic row unless I know exactly what the problem may be in advance in order to set it as codecode instead of codeAutocode.li ol  pThis is what it looks like if it is laid out correctly by using 2 abovep  h2CORRECT LAYOUTh2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCI4Ca.png altcorrect layoup  pDoes anyone know what exactly is wrong here with this fake text wrapping of nothing and how to fix  predict itp

Negative 42420 pIm trying to understand how cp command is similar todifferent from a readwrite combination in terms of context switches. In other words, is using cp to copy data from within application equivalent to using readwrite combination. I think readwrite combination does 4 context swiches  user context  kernel context data copied to kernel buffer, then data copied to user space  user context, for reading, and then another set of 2 context switches for write. How many context switches would happen for cp Also would zerocopy or sendfile be better than using cpp  pIm on linux platform and using kernel later than 2.4.p  pThanks.p
Negative 42420 pIm trying to write a python script that starts a subprocess, and writes to the subprocess stdin. Id also like to be able to determine an action to be taken if the subprocess crashes.p  pThe process Im trying to start is a program called nuke which has its own built in version of python which Id like to be able to submit commands to, and then tell it to quit after the commands execute. So far Ive worked out that if start python in the command prompt like and then start nuke as a subprocess then i can type in commands to nuke but id like to be able to put this all in a script so that the master python program can start nuke and then write to its stdin and thus into its built in version of python and tell it to do snazzy things, so i write a script that start nuke like thisp  precodesubprocess.call[CProgram FilesNuke6.3v5Nuke6.3, t, ENukeTesttest.nk] codepre  pThen nothing happens because nuke is waiting for user input, does anyone know how Id now write to the stdinp  pIm doing this because Im running a plugin with nuke that causes it to crash intermittently when rendering multiple frames. So Id like this script to be able to start nuke, tell it to do something and then if it crashes try again. So if there is a way to catch a crash and still be ok then thatd be great.p

Negative 42420 pIm trying to make an NDKbased game work on Android ICS. It worked fine on Honeycomb and Gingerbread.p  pThe game uses some 2D rendering, some 3D rendering, switching between the two at various stages of execution. This is not negotiable due to thirdparty code. Were using codeANativeWindowlockcodecodeANativeWindowunlockAndPostcode for the 2D rendering, and codeeglCreateWindowSurfacecodecodeglcodecodeeglSwapBufferscode for the 3D rendering.p  pOn Honeycomb and Gingerbread this all worked fine. On ICS, codeeglCreateWindowSurfacecode fails with the following messages in the logp  precodeESurfaceTexture 1765 [com.fnordcom.fnord.MyActivity] connect already connected cur2, req1 ElibEGL   5466 EGLNativeWindowType 0x29e9b8 already connected to another API ElibEGL   5466 eglCreateWindowSurface374 error 300b EGLBADNATIVEWINDOW ElibEGL   5466 call to OpenGL ES API with no current context logged once per thread codepre  pLooking at the source code it seems pretty obvious that codeeglCreateWindowSurfacecode is failing because somethings got the native window open for 2D rendering and it wont let me change it to 3D without somehow releasing the surface first. However, the ANativeWindow API doesnt seem to have any obvious way to do this.p  pHas anyone else run into this, and whats the solutionp  pbUpdatedbp  pSo Ive rewritten my 2D rendering code to use OpenGL primitives instead upload backbuffer to a texture, render texture via a pair of triangles, swapbuffers. This works up to a point. emNowem whats happening is that the 2D rendering works fine then I destroy the surface, create a new one in preparation for 3D rendering, and the second call to codeeglCreateWindowSurfacecode fails. This time, withp  precodeESurfaceTexture 1869 [com.fnordcom.fnord.MyActivity] connect already connected cur1, req1 codepre  p...and it throws an EGL error of codeAEGLBADNATIVEWINDOWcode.p  pNote that the new surface is created with iprecisely the same attributesi as the old one. Ive even tried making sure I call codeeglTerminatecode  codeeglInitializecode between the two calls to codeeglCreateWindowSurfacecode.p  pIs it the case that I can use each ANativeWindow precisely once If so, doesnt that fail Khronos EGL conformance tests Is there a way to get NativeActivity to recreate the window, thenp  pbUpdated updatedbp  pTurns out that the last problem was caused by me failing to call codeeglMakeCurrentdisplay, EGLNOSURFACE, EGLNOSURFACE, EGLNOCONTEXTcode before destroying the context and surface. This was causing the destruction to be delayed until the thread unbound the context and surface, which of course it wasnt, so causing the call to codeeglCreateWindowSurfacecode to legitimately fail you cant have two window surfaces on the same native window.p  pThis is a ibiti counterintuitive, because one would assume that calling codeeglTerminatecode would destroy all EGL resources, but allowed for by the spec. Be warnedp

Negative 42420 pI am new to Eclipse and to Android. I successfully completed the Hello Android tutorial. It compiled, downloaded and ran fine on both of the two AVDs I created ... firstavd and secondavd. To do this, I highlight the application, right click, select Run As  Run Configurations...,  Target, both AVDs are shown, I select one or the other, and it works.p  pI then started on the Notepad tutorial. But I cant run it as above because Run Configurations...  Target displays neither of my AVDs it is greyed out and says No AVD available.p  pHowever, If I just select Run As  Android Application, firstavd seems to be automatically  selected, the application loads and runs. or if either firstavd or secondavd is emalreadyem launched, the application will load and run on the launched AVD. So the aplication works finep  pIm probably missing something really simple here, but Ive been horsing around with this all day, checked Google until I cant figure out any more questions to ask, with no results. Both AVDs have Platform 4.0 and APILevel 14. Both Hello Android and Notepadv1 include  in their Manifest. I should be able to select an AVD to run Notepadv1, but cant.p  pAny hints would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 42420 pI have an application which needs to display around 50 images saved in the sd card.Each image file is encrypted and of size 600kb.

I want to load the images in an efficient wayfaster The solution I have in mind is something like that is there in the default android gallery application.

Negative 42420 pI have implemented several custom modules which essentially bridge Drupal with some third party applications we build in house.p  pNow as my knowledge of Drupal grows I am curious to know whether or not it is possible to integrate my modules with Drupal VIEWS for reporting purposes.p  pMy modules connect directly to several MySQL databases on an external server and perform queries and render those results within the context of Drupal.p  pWhat I would like to do, is use VIEWS somehow to SELECT and manipulate the query as a Drupal VIEW to avoid having to repurpose the module queries each time a change is requested. p  pBasically, is it possible to expose the SQL tables in an external app to one which Drupal VIEWS can pick up I have googled and found a few suggestions but no one seems to know for surep  pIt seems drupal expects all content to be of its own internal content type and thus connected to its core node  is this an assumption VIEWS makesp  pI dont want to export my third party data into Drupal nodes, content types, etc simply so VIEWS can effectively read and render the results.p  pSeems to me, this should be possible with a Drupal module bridging the gap somehowp  pCheers, Alexp

I want the person using the PC can access the internet freely for two hours, but after that, any internet request to specific websites should be denied.

Negative 42420 pI have a requirement in my Java application to execute a set of DB statements in an atomic amp isolated fashion.

Negative 42420 pI have this question, i am just throwing it out there. I am implementing a small logging feature for my spring based REST API server for logging all requests coming in. I am expecting 1000s of users to use this API so with a blocking io logger, its going to slow down everything. I have two approaches to solve the problem 1. Have a async logger using an inmemory arrylist. then use the spring scheduler to flush this out to a log file periodically. 2. Use JMS and send the logs to the queue. Let the queue handle the logging asynchronously.p  pHas anyone done this before with spring. Though i am for option 2, are there better ways of doing this Need some expert advice. Thanks everyone p  pMore info  I think synchronous logging will be a bottle neck because this REST API is consumed by a front end RoR app. So one session of the user will definitely result in 100s of API calls occuring very frequently. I am logging the actual request along with the JSON sent in the POSTs. p

Negative 42420 pI am using the repeated field to validate a password in the form.  According to the documentation, the repeated field group is supposed  to, render two identical fields which it is doing and submit only if  the values from both the fields match or it should throw a validation error.

Negative 42420 pIm writting a browserbased game. The client is in jQuery and the server is in PHPMySQL.p  pIts a turnbased game, so most of the clientserver communication is realised by callrespond jQueryPHP. That calls happens any time the user clicked button or any other active element. After call in JQuery, PHP controller creates some classes, connects to the database and returns respond. That communication is quite good for me, do not cause the problems with the number of connections etc. its similar to the standard trafic during using the website.p  pUnfortunatelly, I also need some calls from serverside. The example is the list of active games to join. Client must be notify any time the game list has changed. And the maximum delay for that is no more than 1 second.p  pFor now I make it by sending ping call from client jQuery and server anserws with nothing most the time, or game2 created etc. But that pings will be send every second from each of the players. And for each of them, the server will create classes and connect to the mysql which results with Database connection error.p  pIs there any way to minimalise mysql connections andor ajax calls I use standard www server, dont have root account.p

Negative 42420 pIm working on a little side project where I need to generate PDF documents using TCPDF and sending them to recipients via email. I managed to get the generation and sending working for one recipient and it was straight forward, however Im getting troubles when it comes to generating PDFs for multiple recipients in the one request.p  pThe following code below is where my PDF generation for multiple recipients occurs. This code belongs to the PDFGeneration Class which I created to generate the PDFs and extends the TCPDF class from the TCPDF library.p  precodeprivate function getHTMLContentsobjName  objName is the name of the object where I am getting the data needed to generate PDF.         obstart         address  SERVER[DOCUMENTROOT].SrcSimpleManagerPDFSMPDFpdfForms         fileName  address. objName .

Currently the URLs look like thisp  pa hrefhttptempertemper.netpost.phps20120530freeagent relnofollowhttptempertemper.netpost.phps20120530freeagentap  pId like them to look like thisp  pa hrefhttptempertemper.net20120530freeagent relnofollowhttptempertemper.net20120530freeagentap  pIve tried adding RewriteRule . post.phps1 to my .htaccess file but its not having it.p  pThe full file currently looks like thisp  precodeltifModule modrewrite.cgt  DirectoryIndex index.php index.html  ErrorDocument 404 httptempertemper.neterror.php  RewriteEngine On RewriteCond HTTPHOST www.tempertemper.net RewriteCond REQUESTURI cron.php RewriteRule . httptempertemper.net1 [R301,L]   ltifModulegt codepre  pIve tried adding this after the canonicalisation bit that redirects www. to non www.p  pRewriteRule [azAZ09] post.phps1p  pIt sort of works. I can then link to a hrefhttptempertemper.net20120530freeagent relnofollowhttptempertemper.net20120530freeagenta but the problem is, a hrefhttptempertemper.netpost.phps20120530freeagent relnofollowhttptempertemper.netpost.phps20120530freeagenta still exists. This is more than likely bad for seo as I guess Ill have duplicate content, in the eyes of the search engines. Ive tried putting a [R301] on the end of the new line but it stops the new link working. Also tried putting the ,L in the square brackets and removing it from the canonicalisation command, but no joy L is for last command, isnt it.p  pBasically, Im after all URLs that generate or have generated with post.phps in them to permanently redirect to the ones without post.phps so that any links that come in to those pages already are redirected and any links in the future will direct straight to the newlook URL.p  pHope that makes sensep  pThanks,p  pMartin p

The function should make use of the euclidean distance between both points.p  pSo far seems like the formula should either be the some of the squares of the distance, or to create a point in between the two given points, and use the euclidean distance to that point. below Ive include the two possible function so far.p  precodep is the point to be sorted p1,p2 are the given points  def fp,p1,p2 Midpoint distance    midPoint  midpointp1,p2    return distancep,midPoint  def fp,p1,p2 Sum of squares    return distancep,p1  2  distancep,p2  2  def distancepointA,pointB Psudocode    dx  pointA.x  pointB.x    dy  pointA.y  pointB.y    return sqrtdx  2  dy  2 codepre  pBelow is an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compe6rW.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe two points being considered here are the ones with the line drawn between them.

Negative 42420 pI have been using subversion for a while now and I am considering learning and switching to GIT, since it seems to be the majoritys preference nowadays.p  pNevertheless, one of the biggest advantages of GIT and source of its complexity is the capability of being decentralized, each person having its own repository and merging repositories whenever needed. I am not interested in this feature, and actually I want to keep everything centralized on a single server, both for projects on which I work alone, as well as  projects where multiple people are expected to have the latest sources at all times stored on the same server, with none or a minimal amount of branchesforks.p  pConsidering this, and that currently most of the development is done on Windows with Visual Studio and also some access is needed from Linux using some simple svn commands, is GIT still a good option would it be worth switching what other features does GIT offer that would benefit usp

Negative 42420 pIm looking for heap structures for priority queues that can be implemented using codeObject[]code arrays stronginsteadstrong of codeNodecode objects.p  pBinary heaps of course work well, and so do nary heaps. Javas codejava.util.PriorityQueuecode is a binary heap, using an codeObject[]code array as storage.p  pThere are plenty of other heaps, such as Fibonacci heaps for example, but as far as I can tell, these need to be implemented using nodes. And from my benchmarks I have the impression that the overhead paid by managing all these node objects comes at a cost that may well eat up all benefits gained. I find it very hard to implement a heap that can comete with the simple arraybacked binary heap.p  pSo Im currently looking for advanced heap  priority queue structures that also do not have the overhead of using codeNodecode objects. Because I want it to be fast in reality, not just better in complexity theory... and there is much more happening in reality for example the CPU has L1, L2 and L3 caches etc. that do affect performance.p  pMy question also focuses on strongJavastrong for the very reason that I have little influence on memory management here, and there are no codestructcodes as in C. A lot of heaps that work well when implemented in C become costly in Java because of the memory management overhead and garbage collection costs.p

Negative 42420 pI had no experience with Controller Area NetworksCAN or ValueCAN3 prior to this project, and I used an example from Intrepid for my reading of messages. However I am having issues with efficiency and frequency of the updates for my GUI which displays the analog and digital signals I am reading.p  pMy GUI consists of 16 numeric updown boxes for analog channels and 36 buttons that change to green depending if a digital signal is turned on 1 or off0. While reading in my CAN messages I then update the GUI controls to display the appropriate feedback. However the digital channels respond almost instantly when I press a button on a CAN joystick that is plugged in, whereas the analog signals dont update that fast with the string pots I am using to vary the signal. Sometimes it takes an analog signal 1  2 seconds to respond. p  pCurrently I set the GUI controls, and then I read the values from the GUI controls and send the values out over a socket connection to another application via UDP. I should probably change this to sending the data from the signals I receive directly rather then reading from the GUI controls I am setting, but I dont think that is the issue. p  pI am using SystemTimersTimer objects to update, read messages, and send out data packets. I need a rate of 50hz  100hz, preferably closer to 100hz. Using the socket on the other end I can see that my packets are sent frequently enough, but the data doesnt change smoothly or frequently for the analog channels. If anyone has any thoughts on what I might be doing wrong, or how to process the data in a more efficient way please state it.p  pHere is the segment of code from Intrepid that reads the CAN messagesp  precode Read the messages every timer event 1000 ms         if mbPortOpen  only if the port is open                       call icsneoGetMessages to read out the messages             lResult  icsneoGetMessageshObject,stMessages,amplNumberOfMessages,amplNumberOfErrors             if lResult  0                               a successful read                 mNumberOfErrorsRead  lNumberOfErrors                 mNumberOfMessagesRead  lNumberOfMessages   store the number of messages in the current buffer                       codepre  pMy form requests a msg from my CanReader Object usingp  precodemsg  cangtGetLatestMsg codepre  pand that method grabs the last message received.p  precodepublic icsSpyMessage GetLatestMsg  return ampstMessages[mNumberOfMessagesRead  1]  codepre  pI think this GetLatestMsg seems like a bad way to implement the retrival of the latest message, but Im not entirely sure how much this is affecting my program or how else I could do this because the CanReader is seperate from the Form so Id have to pass an array of messages I think otherwise. I do suspect this might be skipping messages because it only reads the last one grabbed and not the ones leading up to it, which if those were read should make the GUI output appear smoother for transitions.p  pAnother thing to note is that I am reading from 6 different PGNs, the analog signals correspond to 4 of the PGNs and 2 correspond to the digital signals.p  h3UPDATEh3  pAfter playing with my application and using the string pots on different analog channels I am noticing that some channels are updating more then others. And by checking the PGNs being accessed I find that I am accessing some more frequently then others.p  pDoesnt a CAN device broadcast the data at relatively the same rates for the different PGNs and if yes then my GetLatestMsg method must not be reading the different PGNs effectively. It reads a new msg every 5 milliseconds.p  pAdditionally, does anyone know if I should make seperate reading timers to detect the different PGNs seperatelyp  pIf there is additional code I can provide for clarity please let me know.p

Negative 42420 pI started learning Java a few days ago at university Subject is Server programming, and we started writing two codes that would act as a client and a server, so the client sent a string with 3 numeric values to the server, which would have to apply a math formula I dont remember what formula, but that doesnt matter and then return the result to the client, which had to print it in the screen or whatever.p  pHere are my codes.

Negative 42420 pIm writing a serverclient architecture based game in Java.p  pFor design reasons, I would like to use asynchronous calls for passing client actions to the server, and also asynchronous callbacks for passing the results of said actions back to the client. Asynchronous calls allow buffering of client actions. Queued buffering allows simple, basically one threaded processing of client actions.p  pAt the moment, my server and client code is pretty symmetric. They create a registry, then export and bind themselves.p  pAsynchronicity is achieved by buffering the incoming actions or results in a ConcurrentLinkedQueue. Actual processing is done by a thread running at regular intervals.p  pHowever, this current architecture does not work when clients are firewalled or behind a NAT. In this case the server simply can not reach clients to push results to them.p  pFurthermore, in this current architecture the server does not know which client sent a given action, unless a redundant layer of authentication or session handling is introduced. This allows forged actions and cheating.p  hr  pIve been thinking about possible solutions but havent found a proper onep  ul lipClient pull instead of server push. There could be a method on the server that the clients call periodically to fetch their results. However, this approach seems very ugly, it introduces additional delays, bandwidth and timing issues. Does not solve action forgery either. Direct notifications are also very much preferred.pli lipTCP connections by themselves allow bidirectional communication, and can definitely identify clients, so RMI or JRemoting emmightem be hacked to support it, but Im dont know how, and Im not aware of any existing solution.pli lipMessage passing. Im not sure whether message passing frameworks support authentication  sessions or client identification. Id definitely lose remote methods though.pli lipI believe the correct solution would be to find a remote method invocation framework that supports all of the above.pli ul  hr  pSo in a nutshell, Im searching for a way top  ul licall the server asynchronously or pass a message to itli licall the client asynchronously or pass a message to it, even behind firewall or NATli liidentify the client sending the actionli lipreferably be able to call methods, not just pass messagesli likeep the ability to easily test it with JUnit and Mockito multiple clients per machineli ul  pAre there any remote method invocation frameworks with support for these Which is the bestp

After a user selects a service type in needs to generate a name which is located in another table. The problem I have is that the service type is using a service number which is located in both tables. However in one table the creator added leading zeros to the number. For example one table will have 205 and the other table will have 0000205 I need to compare these to get the name value I want. Here is the coding I have so far.

Negative 42420 pIve been searching around SO and have found some related posts, but none that have yet solved my problem.  p  pI have a view setup in my storyboard, with a constraint hooked up through an IBOulet.

Negative 42420 pThanks for lookingp  h1Backgroundh1  pI realize that jQuery templates has been set aside for some other shiny objects, but I am obligated to using the framework on my current project anyway.p  pI am writing a dynamic form builder that accepts JSON and then renders the proper form fields, and am binding to a template for oneoff controls.  For example, a JSON object representing a basic text field would correspond to a template like thisp  precode   lt BEGIN TEXTBOX TEMPLATE gt     ltscript typetexthtml idTemplateTextBoxgt         ltdiv classformFieldgt             ltlabelgt                 LabelText                 ltspan classsmallgtHelpTextltspangt             ltlabelgt             ltinput typetext idFieldId placeholderPlaceholder gt             ltdiv classclear10gtltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltscriptgt     lt END TEXTBOX TEMPLATE gt codepre  pThe FormBuilder class lives in its own JavaScript file and will be used throughout the project.p  h1Questionh1  pSince this class will be used to render form fields throughout the project, and since those fields will always look the same i.e. text input, select list, etc, I would like to just standardize the jQuery templates and keep them all in one place rather than have to paste those templates onto every page that has a form.  I would prefer to initialize these templates somehow in my codeFormBuilder.jscode file with the rest of the form building logic or at the very least have a HTML page somewhere that contains all of the templates and can be referenced by the .js file for use across the site.p  pIs this possible  If so, howp

Negative 42420 pI have a 2 node hadoop 1 is the masterslave and another slave setup and 4 input files each of size 1GB. When i set dfs.replicate to 2, then the entire data is copied over to both the nodes which is understandable. But my question is that, how do i see an improved performance almost twice as better over a single node setup since in the 2 node case, mapreduce will still run over the complete data set on both the systems along with the added overhead of channeling the inputs from 2 mappers to reducers.p  pAlso when i set the replication as 1, the entire data exists only on the master node which is also understandable to avoid ethernet overhead. But even in this case, i see a performance improvement compared to single node setup which i find confusing, since mapreduce runs on local data sets, this scenario should essentially be similar to single node setup with one mapreduce program running on master node on the entire data set p  pCan someone help me understand what i am missing here p  pThanks Pawanp

Negative 42420 pIm in the design phase of development and am considering using multithreading in C to implement some functionality.  Im familiar with the basics of multithreading but wanted to get others take on my idea.  I havent chosen a multithreading library yet leaning towards Boost but my question is probably independent of the library chosen.p  pBasically I would have a class lets call it CommandGenerator that executes in a while loop until terminated and checks a message queue of commands that is populated by another piece of software.  Every time CommandGenerator gets a message off the queue, Id like it to spawn a thread that executes in the background and works with the data just pulled off the queue.  Meanwhile I want CommandGenerator to continue to run and come around the while loop again and pull any new messages and again spawn more threads.  Is this conceptually possible  Can I keep spawning threads and just let them run in the background until they complete while the code continues to loop and check the queue  CommandGenerator will not need to have control over the threads.  They would be able to execute independently once created and are guaranteed to terminate but may take up to a minute to finish executing they wait a certain amount of time specified in the message pulled off the queue before executing.p  pAny input is appreciated.p

Negative 42420 pI know that is possible to use memorymapped files i.e. real files on disk that are transparently mapped to memory. As far as I understand I havent used these yet the mapping takes place immediately, the file is partly read on the first memory access while the OS starts caching the whole file in the background.p  pNow Is it possible to somewhat abuse this concept and memorymap another block of memory Assuming the OS provides such indirection one could create a kind of codecompressedmalloccode that returns a mapping from memory to memory. The memory returned to the caller is simple the memorymapped range that is transparently compressed in memory and also eventually kept in memory. Thus, for large buffers it could be possible that only part of it get decompressed onthefly on access while the remaining blocks are kept compressed.p  pIs that concept technically possible at the moment or  if already realized in software  what are the things to look at p  pUpdate 1 I am more or less looking for something that is technically achievable without modifying the OS kernel itself or which requires a virtualization platform.p  pUpdate 2 I am hoping for something which allows me to implement the compression and related logic in my own userspace code. I would just use the facilities of the operating system to create the memorymapping.p
Negative 42420 pThis seems like it should be a relatively straightforward task but Ive tackled it a few different ways with no luck so far.  p  pI have two tables  People and Addresses.  I have a form with a recordsource that is a query joining these two tables. What I want to do is have the header display strongThe database currently contains [txtPersonCount] people at [txtAddressCount] addresses.strongp  pSince person key and address key are distinct within their respective tables my first thought was simply to set the controlsource of the textboxes to codeCount[tblPeople].[PersonID]code and codeCount[tblAddress].[AddressID]code. p  pOddly, the count of address ID appears in both textboxes with this method. I assume whats happening is rather than counting the IDs from the respective tables, the IDs are being counted from the query behind the forms recordsource for which there are more addresses than people, so it would make sense.p  pI then attempted to basically do the same thing by declaring my SQL queries as a string         p  precodeDim sql As String sql  SELECT COUNTtblPeople.[PersonID] FROM tblPeople  Forms[frmBrowse].[txtPersonCount].ControlSource  sql codepre  pBut that only ends up making the textbox display the text of the query.  Changing the string to be codeSELECT COUNT....code makes no difference.  p  pAny ideas on how to solve thisp

Negative 42420 pFor someone used to imperative programming, its sometimes hard to write efficient code in functional languages without using arraysvectors. However, it seems theres always a smart way of doing it. Sorting, for example, can be done in Onlogn time both in imperative and declarative programming languages, and the absence of swapping operations is not a real problem.p  pConsider a functional programming language that has no arrays or any data structure that can access an arbitrary element in constant time. Take a subset of SML or Haskell without arrays, for example.p  pOf course, every computable problem is solvable by  a program written in such language. But Im wondering if there is any problem that intrinsically cant be solved efficiently outside the imperative world. By efficiently, I mean with at most the same time complexity of the best known imperative algorithm to solve the problem.p  pFor example, can matrix multiplication be computed efficiently using only lists in SML or Haskellp

Negative 42420 pIm trying to set up authentication for a Yii application that Im building. I started from the demo application and made some changes for style, content, and the forgot passwordemail confirmation schemes I want to use. p  pThis works locally. The problem is, when I push to the server, I am unable to log in.

Negative 42420 pI have a uPortal JSR268 Spring MVC portlet, which has a welcome page. All links on the landing page render the next page in maximised mode, and this is true of all internal links.p  pWhat I want to do is render the welcome page if the user is on any other page, and changes the WindowState from maximised. This applies to RenderRequests only, I am not concerned about any other type of request here.p  pUsers can change WindowState via the user interface using the return to dashboard link, by clicking the window buttons on the portal or, if they know what they are doing, by manipulating the URL. p  pI am able to identify requests for the welcome page by examining the request parameters.p  pI have tried  an interceptor, but all I seem to be able to do here is return false, which results in no content being rendered in the portlet. This is not acceptable.  throwing an error from the interceptor. This is a small improvement as I can show a custom error page, but it still does not allow me to render the welcome page.p  pIt would also be acceptable to redirect to the originally requested page with WindowState set back to maximised. Portlets dont seem to support redirecting. p  pIf I was dealing with ActionRequests, I could set a RenderParameter on the ActionResponse from the interceptor which would cause the welcome page to be rendered. However there doesnt seem to be an equivalent for RenderRequests. Am I missing somethingp

The problem appears to have something to do with the frame  bounds of the codeUIImageViewcode. I think theres a method call I need to make so that the cells subview expands to fit the newlyresized cell following the call to codecollectionViewlayoutsizeForItemAtIndexPathcode. The problem now is that codeUIImageView.image.sizecode is a readonly property, so I cant resize it directly.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong On another piece of advice I looked at the frame and bounds of the cells codecontentViewcode and codecellImagecode and found that they werent matching up. Added another method call to make them equal, and even changed codecontentModecode to codeUIViewContentModeScaleAspectFitcode in order to try and get the cell to render the thumbnail properly.

Negative 42420 pI have been looking far and wide to find out how, if its possible, you can fill a particular area in a QML screen with an OpenGL context and do custom OpenGL only in that context. Ive seen plenty of demos where the QML components like buttons, etc lay on top or below a screenwide OpenGL context as is typically required by games, but Id like to be able to situate several distinct OpenGL contexts within QML and have the QML file define how large they are, where they are positioned, etc.p  pNow, since Qt 5 is all OpenGL under the hood, it makes me wonder if using a Canvas element with custom drawing via javascript could result in similar rendering performance as custom OpenGL This would be a meaningful alternative but its not clear to me how the javascript drawing is handled via runtime compared to custom OpenGL drawing.p

Negative 42420 pIm trying to get audio in my app to play through the upper speaker on the iPhone, the one you press to your ear during a phone call.  I know its possible, because Ive played a game from the App Store The Heist by tap tap tap that simulates phone calls and does exactly that.p  pIve done a lot of research online, but Im having a surprisingly hard time finding ANYONE who has even discussed the possibility.  The overwhelming majority of posts seem to be about the handsfree speaker vs pluggedin earphones, like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15128455switchingbetweenheadphonespeakeroniphonerq1thisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5931799redirectingaudiooutputtophonespeakerandmicinputtoheadphonesrq1thisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9963011inios5howtouseaudiosessiontomakesureaudioisplayedthroughspeakerarq1thisa, rather than the upper phone call speaker vs the handsfree speaker.  Part of that problem might be not having a good name for it phone speaker often means the handsfree speaker at the bottom of the device, etc, so its hard to do a really welltargeted search.  Ive looked into Apples codeAudio Session Category Route Overridescode, but those again seem to correct me if Im wrong deal only with the handsfree speaker at the bottom, not the speaker at the top of the phone.p  pI have found ONE post that seems to be about this a hrefhttpiphonedevsdk.comforumiphonesdkdevelopment107557soundplaythroughupperspeaker.html relnofollowlinka.  It even provides a bunch of code, so I thought I was home free, but now I cant seem to get the code to work.  For simplicity I just copied the codeDisableSpeakerPhonecode method which if I understand it correctly should be the one to reroute audio to the upper speaker into my codeviewDidLoadcode to see if it would work, but the first assert line fails, and the audio continues to play out the bottom.  I also imported the AudioToolbox Framework, as suggested in the comment, so that isnt the problem.p  pHere is the main block of code Im working with this is what I copied into my codeviewDidLoadcode to test, although there are a few more methods in the article I linked top  precodevoid DisableSpeakerPhone       UInt32 dataSize  sizeofCFStringRef     CFStringRef currentRoute  NULL     OSStatus result  noErr      AudioSessionGetPropertykAudioSessionPropertyAudioRoute, ampdataSize, ampcurrentRoute       Set the category to use the speakers and microphone.

It still isnt working, though, by which I mean the audio is still coming out of the speaker at the bottom of the phone instead of the receiver at the top.  Apparently the default behavior should be for codeAVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecordcode to send audio out of the receiver on its own, so something is still wrong.p  pMore specifically what Im doing with this code is playing audio through the iPod Music Player initialized right after the AVAudioSession lines above in codeviewDidLoadcode, for what its worthp  precodemusicPlayer  [MPMusicPlayerController iPodMusicPlayer] codepre  pand the media for that iPod Music Player is chosen through an codeMPMediaPickerControllercodep  precode void mediaPicker MPMediaPickerController  mediaPicker didPickMediaItems MPMediaItemCollection  mediaItemCollection      if mediaItemCollection          [musicPlayer setQueueWithItemCollection mediaItemCollection]         [musicPlayer play]           [self dismissViewControllerAnimatedYES completionnil]  codepre  pThis all seems fairly straightforward to me, Ive got no errors or warnings, and I know that the Media Picker and Music Player are working correctly because the correct songs start playing, its just out of the wrong speaker. Could there be a play media using this AudioSession method or something  Or is there a way to check what audio session category is currently active, to confirm that nothing could have switched it back or something  Is there a way to emphatically tell the code to USE the receiver, rather than relying on the default to do so  I feel like Im on the oneyard line, I just need to cross that final bit...p  pstrongEDITstrong I just thought of a theory, wherein its something about the iPod Music Player that doesnt want to play out of the receiver.  My reasoning it is possible to set a song to start playing through the official iPod app and then seamlessly adjust it pause, skip, etc through the app Im developing.  The continuous playback from one app to the next made me think that maybe the iPod Music Player has its own audio route settings, or maybe it doesnt stop to check the settings in the new app  Does anyone who knows what theyre talking about think it could it be something like thatp

Negative 42420 pI am relatively new to Selenium. We are using the Selenium IDE to do some regression testing. I have a menu bar that has different buttons on it that will drop down a menu when you hover over any of the buttons there are 4 buttons on the menu bar. So when i select one of the menu items from the dropdown, it opens a page inside the same window. This page looking at the debug info in Selenium seems to be a frame. This frame open right under the menu bar and the menu bar is still visible. Once the page has loaded completely, I want to go outside the frame and click on a button on the menu bar and click on the next item to verify. This doesnt seem to work, once the page frame has loaded then nothing happens. I have tried using window focus, select frame, mouse over commands but nothing seem to work. i have also used the relative  parent and relative  top commands with the select frame command but cant get it to work.p  pAny tips or suggestions are welcome. If I am not clear on the description I can provide more details. Thanks for the assist.p

The worksheet labeled Data is where all my information is I am looking through and pulling from, and the worksheet labeled Sales houses the value I want to search for as well as where I want the column data pasted once it is found.p  pHere is what I have so far, Ive tried a few different things to try to select columns C to O but nothing has worked yetp  precode    Sub TestCopyData     Macro to copy sales based on site            Dim numentries As Integer     Dim i As Integer     Dim site As String            Define sheet names     Data  Data1     Sales  Sales            Get number of entries and desired scores      numentries  WorksheetsData.UsedRange.Rows.Count            site  WorksheetsSales.RangeB1.Value            Run loop to cycle through all entries rows to copy       For i  1 To numentries          If WorksheetsData.Cellsi  2, 1.Value  site Then                  WorksheetsData.RangeCO amp i  2.Copy                       DestinationWorksheetsSales.RangeA2            End If      Next i      End Sub codepre
Negative 42420 pSo when I open my document, this is what I seep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKG28F.png altenter image description herep  pHere are the first and the first part of the second page the rest of it is empty of my document. Except for the content in the green rectangle which is managed by box layout, they are 100 equal.p  pAfter all visible elements magenta stuff, the first JTextArea bigger than the others doesnt matter regarding to the problem, they both have a Box.Filler added to them, to push all the content to the top of the page.p  pSo when I open the document item 38. should be as high as all others, but for some reason it isnt.p  pI didt call the repaint and validate on both JScrollPane and its viewport that conatins both pages right after opening of a document.p  pAlso, when I add or remove another element anywhere in the document, number 38 comes to its senses and resizes to its proper height. I did call the sam repaints and validates when that happens as I have at the opening of the document.p  pchageShape method called on the filler with same sizes it had does the trick, but it seems to be a dirty solution...p  pBut why doesnt it do that right awayp  pEDIT After some more testing, I have discovered that the filler has been a bad bad boy here. But its hard for me to understand why the one on the first page always updates itself properly even with fewer elements on the page, but the one on second page refuses to, even though there are no differences in how the two pages were coded two instances of the same object and that repaint and validate is called from a container superior to both.p

Negative 42420 pSo the idea is when the user havent installed DirectX EndUser Runtime the program to show message like DirectX Runtime missing Download it from here, instead of the windows loader error eg. d3dx943.dll is missing. So I find a very funky solution of the problem as I used a delay loaded DLLs and an DLL check before any function defined in the module is invoked using LoadLibrary. If the dll is missing the program shows a userdefined dialog box and exits, otherwise it calls FreeLibrary with the HMODULE returned by LoadLibrary and continues executing. This is implemented as a function like followsp  precodebool CheckResourcesAvailability Mainly check for the existence of delay loaded DLLs      HMODULE hMod Resourse handle      ifhMod  LoadLibraryExTd3d9.dll, NULL, LOADLIBRARYASDATAFILEEXCLUSIVE  NULL              DialogBoxhProgramInstance, MAKEINTRESOURCEIDDDXRE, 0, DLGPROCampDxRedistMissingDlg         return false           FreeLibraryhMod      ifhMod  LoadLibraryExTD3DX943.dll, NULL, LOADLIBRARYASDATAFILEEXCLUSIVE  NULL              DialogBoxhProgramInstance, MAKEINTRESOURCEIDDDXRE, 0, DLGPROCampDxRedistMissingDlg         return false           FreeLibraryhMod      return true  codepre  pAs DxRedistMissingDlg and MAKEINTRESOURCEIDDDXRE creates the userdefined error message dialog.p  pAnd In WinMain its called as followsp  precodeint WINAPI WinMainHINSTANCE hInstance,                    HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,                    LPSTR lpCmdLine,                    int nCmdShow      hProgramInstance  hInstance  ifndef DEBUG     SetErrorModeSEMFAILCRITICALERRORS Dont display windows error messages endif      Check for missing delay  loaded dependencies and inform the user     ifCheckResourcesAvailability         return 1     Some other code.........   codepre  pBut I dont think this is the cleanest way to do it. First we arent sure that d3dx9.lib really inherits from D3DX943.dll I know that because I used IDA PRO and also the LoadLibrary function is called twice  one time at the CheckResourcesAvailability function and second when the DLL is delayloaded. Any ideas for a better implementationp

Negative 42420 pI was looking at another q on here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10939082d3javascriptalternatecolorsonclickd3 javascript alternate colors on clicka and was wondering how it would be possible to bring in a transition to the change. p  pIve rewritten the code slightly so that the toggle function changes the location of the circle rather than the colour. p  precodevar SVG  d3.selectbody     .appendsvg     .attrwidth, 300     .attrheight, 300      var togglex  function var currentx  50  return function     currentx  currentx  50  200  50     d3.selectthis.attrcx, currentx      SVG.appendcircle     .stylestroke, gray     .stylefill, white     .attrr, 20     .attrcx, 50     .attrcy, 50     .onclick, togglex codepre  pSo the togglex function moves the circle around when its clicked. Ive tried to put a transition in both before and after the .onclick, toggle but it doesnt work. I can kind of understand why it doesnt, its a function, not a position on the screen.

Negative 42420 pIm making a C framework that is supposed to manage separately built custom modules, which are loaded at runtime as shared libraries. These modules have to communicate with each other using custom data, thus Im using an unorderedmap containing boostany values that each module can use to set and read data.p  pThe program has recently started to give a segfault error on shutdown, after a small change in destruction ordering of objects. After some tracking, I think I found the error even though the unorderedmap that holds all shared data is kept by the framework, each boostany contains values that are created necessarily by code that resides in the shared libraries, since the framework has no idea of what valuestypes each key will contain during compilation.p  pWhat happens is that if I unload all shared libraries before I deallocate the map, boostany generates a segfault when destroyed, since I suppose the pointer which contains its value has been already unloaded from memory. If I instead first delete the map and then deallocate all modules, no error shows up. Thus I am assuming that when a boostany value is created and filled, its contents somehow gets allocated on some memory associated with the shared library, and when the shared library is closed trying to delete boostany crashes everything.p  precodestdunorderedmapltstdstring, boostanygt shareddata stdvectorltModulegt dynamicallyloadedmodules   RUNTIME DURING SOME MODULE EXECUTION shareddata[SomeKey]  myunknowntypeddata   ON PROGRAM EXIT dynamicallyloadedmodules.clear  Calls dlclose shareddata.clear  This crashes   shareddata.clear dynamicallyloadedmodules.clear  This does not crash codepre  pMy questions are the followingp  ul liIs my interpretation of what is happening realistically possible I dont know all that much about how shared libraries are managed by dlfcn.hli liIs deallocating the map and then the modules safe Or should I have a way to make the modules explicitly delete each boostany they created Would I even need to do thatli ul

Negative 42420 pstrongEdit For Clarificationstrongp  pstrongIs there a way to split a classs header across multiple files, such that other classes can include only the parts of that classs implementation its supposed to be allowed to usestrongp  pstrongemBelow is specific details to my desired implementationem NOT A NECESSARY READstrongp  pAnyways, Im creating an entitycomponent system. I would like to structure it as followsp  pThere is an EntityPool object that exists mainly as a memory storemanager for entities and their components. I would like to have a specified degree of access from my Game class for example, the ability to constructdestruct the pool, and the ability to access arrays of components ei the ability to iterate through all renderable components.p  pThere is a base class of EntityFactory that I would like to have a greater degree of access to the entity pool. It would be used by the Game class as followsp  precodeGruntEntityFactory efampEntityPool GruntEntityFactory inherits from EntityFactory  ef.produce codepre  pThe Entity Factory would then use its access to the Entity Pool to create the necessary components and put them in place. p  pThe thing to note here is that Game would have access only to create the EntityPool and read its contents, but would NOT be able to directly alter its contents. Everything that inherits EntityFactory, on the other hand, I would like to give access to manage EntityPools contents.p  pstrongIs there a way I can include a different EntityPool header in each of the files, such that each is only aware of the functions it has access to Is that the best way to do this assuming its possiblestrongp  pAlso I realize this tightly couples the EntityPool and EntityFactories. That is intentional. And also, I would like to not have to list every EntityFactory I make as a friend class in EntityPool. p  pThanksp  pstrongExample code for clarificationstrongp  precodeIn my Game Class include entitypool.h include entityfactorygrunt.h  ...  EntityPool ep Construct an EntityPool GruntEntityFactory gefampep Pass an EntityPool pointer to an EntityFactory gef.produce Call produce on GruntEntityFactory, and have it add appropriate components to the EntityPool  I would like this next line to not be allowed. Game shouldnt be able to  directly manipulate the components other internal EntityPool structure. However, I WOULD like EntityFactories to retain the ability to do so. otherwise, how would EntityFactory.produce work ep.addComponentPhysicsComponent pc1, 2, 3   I WOULD like Game to be able to access certain functions of EntityPool forint i  0 i lt ep.numPhysicsComponents iLike the count of entities     physicsSolver.updateep.physicsComponents[i]And the ability to updaterender components codepre  pOk. So hopefully thats sensible enough of an example to get an idea for what I want. The reason for the title is that my first intuition on how to achieve this would be to have 2 header files.p  precodeEntityPoolGameAccess.h This file would contain prototypes for the functions utilized by Game, but NOT the ones that game is not allowed to see.  class EntityPool      public         int numPhysicsComponents         PhysicsComponent getPhysicsComponentint i  codepre  pandp  precodeEntityPoolFactoryAccess.h This file would contain prototypes for the functions that only ought be used by classes specifically built to manipulate entitypool  class EntityPool      public         void addPhysicsComponentPhysicsComponent pc         int numPhysicsComponents         PhysicsComponent getPhysicsComponentint i  codepre  pObviously these examples are simplified. Hopefully Im still getting the idea across strongI would like a class with certain functions that are accessible to certain classes, and other functions that are accessible to other classes.strongp

Negative 42420 pIm getting a bit confused here. Ive got a navigation drawer with a Fragment in it for my google maps page. The idea is they click a marker, they see a button that takes them to a new activity. p  pWhat I want is for the user to see the maps page again if they exit the app via the home button, and refresh it, when they go back into the app. So is that possiblep  pCalling codeonStopcode in the activity does take me back to the fragment, but the map does not refresh. I call codefinishcode in the codeonStopcode so backstack wise the maps page is the most current. p  pIs there a method Im missing that will let me refresh the map within it I have a method that pulls the markers and what not when the map loads. But of course this just takes be back to where I was. I want to call the coderefreshMapcode method.p  pMaybe a cheaty way. I have a refresh button in the onCreateOptionsMenu so maybe just things like onKeyDown to force a back button, maybe we can force a tap on that button Guess thats only for hardware buttons.p  pHopefully someone can guide me the right direction. The refreshing is important because otherwise the user can click on an expired marker from hours ago and still get the offer.p  pThanks for any help given, really appreciate itp

Negative 42420 pI am working on a Screen Capture to h.264 bitstream solution using the Intel Media SDK. I read the new 2nd Generation Intel processors have a hardware accelerated encoder so i am expecting the encode latency to drop and make it realtime. p  pUsing ffmpeg 32bit version doing a screen capture and x264 i get an end to end latency of 200ms on the Pi. Well the Raspberry pi has a hardware decoder so i am guessing it does the decode in around 80ms. I used a Intel i5 520M and a 1st gen i7 to do the decoding the end to end was 250350ms latency after using the Raspberry pi that went down to 150200.p  pHow do i link the Direct Show Screen Capture filter to the Intel Media SDK input  there is not documentation i can follow, if anyone can shine some light.p

Negative 42420 pI currently have an mfc based dialog box application and a console application both created in visual studio 2010 right now they are separate. I was wondering how I can combine these two solutions so I can read the user input from the dialog box application and use it for the console based application. Once the user clicks ok on the dialog box GUI, the console based app should appear with information dependent on the users input. Any example code would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp
Negative 42420 pIm working on a large Silverlight solution with 75 projects.  Instead of right clicking on the start up project and then selecting Debug  Start New Instance...   Id like to use a keyboard shortcut to run this specific project.  Hitting F5 is a nonstarter, even if I select the option to only build the start up project and its dependencies. Takes too long.p  pAccomplishing this was easy with the macro functionality in VS 2010.  I havent been able to find a good way to replace this capability in VS2102.  Note, I have tried the Visual Commander extension but it doesnt seem to be able to automate this kind of command sequence.p

The above plot seems to choose a couple groups and plot them all black, instead of just the select data points in foo, while in my real data, R just ignores the ifelse statement and doesnt change any data points at all, it just uses the myColours palette.p  pThanksp

Negative 42420 pSo Im confused about Doctrine 2s lifecycle events. I have a subscriber event class that implements prePersit, preUpdate, postUpdate, and postLoad. Basically what Im trying to do is to encrypt an entitys particular value on prePersist and preUpdate when updating a value, and decrypt the value on postLoad.p  pThe decryption is working perfectly. However, Im currently having two problems with these lifecycle events p  ol liwhen preUpdate is triggered, it encrypts the value correctly looking at my debugger but once it gets committed to the database, I can see the that value is in clear text. Whats the deal hereli liI have also implemented the postUpdate event, which I was thinking that it would be triggered after the update is committed to the database, which would give me chance to decrypt the value for viewing on the UI, but following the debugger this is not case. The preUpdate is triggered first when doing an update, then followed by postUpdate, and finally this changes are committed to the database. Which event life cycle should I be using for this caseli ol

Negative 42420 pI have a GridView and the IsItemClickEnabled is set to true. In this case, the ItemClick event is fired, and it calls a delegate with a sender and an ItemClickEventArgs. Im using MVVM Caliburn.Micro, and my view models are all sitting in a portable class library PCL. All command routing, etc., is done by ReactiveUI. The Views data context is set to the view model, as you might expect.p  pThe problem is ItemClickEventArgs is not available in a PCL configuration as far as I can tell.

But once Im there, how the heck do I get the information back into my View Model As far as I know the view knows nothing about the view model.p  pThe only thing I can think of is I need to create some property that contains the PCL object that was clicked on. This method would stuff the item into that property, and through some magic of databinding that would be sent back to the view model. If so, I have no idea how to participate in the databinding process to get that right Ack p  pI dont know if this makes a difference yet, but Im not using universal apps And Im using a nasty hybrid of Caliburn.Micro to hook up my views, and Reactiveui and rx to run all my commands. I dont like making anything easyp

We have set up a simple Chef server to manage configs on all nodes, and have created recipes for app and DB servers.p  pOn the Chef server, we currently have an autoupdate feature that runs every 30 minutes to check all nodes and make sure theyre in synch with their respective recipes. The way our inhouse chef a sys admin set everything up, theres a part of a recipe that does an existential check on Tomcats codewebappscode directory to determine whether an update should be performed or not. In other words, if Tomcats webapps directory has a WAR inside of it already, then when the autoupdate runs every 30 mins, since codewebappscode isnt empty, Chef wont go out to the CI server and pull in the new WAR.p  pTo combat this, our chef cooked up a strongclean slatestrong recipe that will first delete exploded WARs from Tomcats webapps dir. So as long as that recipe executes first, TOMCATHOMEwebapps will be executed before the Tomcat check it then removes itself from the Chef runlist. His reasoning for this removal was that  in production  if we are always deleting Tomcats webapps dir then we will be redeploying prod nodes every 30 minutes.p  pSo on DEV, we do want every CI build to produce a new WAR being deployed to our Tomcat instances devapp0102. In PROD, we want to manually kick off the deployment, which according to how this chef has configured everything, involves manually adding the strongclean slate recipestrong so that the CI server can deploy the new WAR.p  pIm wondering how other peopleteams have used CI and Chef in conjunction in the past, and if they ran into similar issues. My concrete question is stronghow can we accomplish letting CI drive all the DEV deployments, but still make PROD deployments a manual processstrongp

Negative 42420 pIm trying to create a simple game in android. By road I meant games like codeTemple Runcode or codeSubway Surfcode but much simpler and abstract so I could do it only with the OpenGL ES without any other libraries.

I made the square to look more like a rectangle and duplicate it to a 30x5 square road. Ive tried many combinations and the internet to find a solution and yet I have this problemsquestionsp  ol liHow do I set all 30x5 squares to be one next to another Im always getting the squares with some unwanted gapli liI want to set the vieweye point the camera 45 degrees to the middle of the first row, so the player could see the road upon himli liNext, I would want to move along the road. So Ive seen the rotate and how it works. Is there a way to do the same to the viewpoint or do I need to change the squares drawing Zsli liI see that onDrawFrame is calling over and over many times.

I am not sure if it is the expander control or the datagrid itself that is buggy any ideasp  pI should specify the cpu usage goes up only when i try to expand the groups within the datagridGrpahic rendering issue. by default i have them collapsed. also this happens with no extra styling or teplates applied to the datagrid or the columns.p  precode ltDataGrid.GroupStylegt     lt Style for groups at top level. gt     ltGroupStylegt       ltGroupStyle.ContainerStylegt         ltStyle TargetTypexType GroupItemgt           ltSetter PropertyTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt               ltControlTemplategt                 ltExpander IsExpandedfalsegt                   ltExpander.Headergt                     ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt                       ltTextBlock VerticalAlignmentBottom FontSize13 FontWeightBold ForegroundGhostwhite TextBinding Name gt                       ltTextBlock Margin10,0,0,0 VerticalAlignmentBottom FontSize13 FontStyleItalic FontWeightBold ForegroundGreen TextBinding ItemCount gt                     ltStackPanelgt                   ltExpander.Headergt                   ltItemsPresenter gt                 ltExpandergt               ltControlTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt           ltSettergt         ltStylegt       ltGroupStyle.ContainerStylegt     ltGroupStylegt   ltDataGrid.GroupStylegt codepre
Negative 42420 pI am very new to SQL and I am trying to update a stored procedure that has a cursor in it. I had never seen a cursor prior to this one. The cursors select statement has an inner join, but returns only a single column of IDs. The cursor calculates the number of deleted accounts for every ID, on a row by row basis. At the end of the stored procedure, the number of deletion variables are inserted into a tablep  pI was hoping someone that understands more about cursorswhile loops would be able to suggest the best way to convert the code above into an efficient set based approach.p

Negative 42420 pmy first question on StackOverflow, so apologies if not perfect right from the beginning ...p  pMy question is actually twofoldp  ol lipCan I have the LightSwitch ApplicationData service or any other internally defined Data Source define ODATA actions on the service level or entity setentity level If yes, how do I do that I cannot find the route information in the application where I could overrideadd that.pli lipHow would I consume these actions from the client side via the builtin MS JS object model in msls or via screenentity Even, if LightSwitch itself could not createwould not support actions, I would still like to know how to consume them from the client side, as we are exposing external ODATA data sources via LightSwitch to the client and these ODATA source have actions defined. I know I can use jaydata from the client side to consume that and execute actions on an ODATA source, but I would like to know if LightSwitch has builtin support for that.pli ol  pFurther information we are using VSLS 2013. And Silverlight is not an option, we only use the HTML client.p  pThank you very much for your support and hints Regards, Ronaldp

Negative 42420 pI have a CUDA program for calculating FFTs of, lets say, size code50000code. Currently, I copy the whole array to the GPU and execute the cuFFT. Now, I am trying to optimize the programm and the NVIDIA Visual Profiler tells me to hide the memcopy by concurrency with parallel computations. My question isp  pemIs it possible, for example, to copy the first code5000code Elements, then start calculating, then copying the next bunch of data in parallel to calculations etcemp  pSince a DFT is basically a sum over the time values multiplied with a complex exponential function, I think that it should possible to calculate the FFT blockwise. p  pemDoes cufft support this Is it in general a good computational ideaemp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTo be more clear, I do not want to calculate different FFTs parallel on different arrays. Lets say I have a big trace of a sinusoidal signal in the time domain and I want to know which frequencies are in the signal. My Idea is to copy, for example, one third of the signal length to the GPU, then the next third and calculate the FFT with the first third of the already copied input values parallel. Then copy the last third and update the output values until all the time values are processed. So in the end there should be one output array with a peak at the frequency of the sinus.p

Negative 42420 pI know there are lots of options out there, and sorry to ask such a similar question again, but its different enough to warrant it  I think. I have one Java app, lets call it the master, that will do some work, and then it needs to inform other Java apps in other JVMs about it. Today they are on the same machine, but this will not always be the case.p  pId prefer something that has an easy way to addremove listeners i.e., other JVMs, etc...so RMI or Web Services are not suitable as thered be too much manual coding there to look after who is what, etc. p  pId also like the ability to add new Java apps again, in other JVMs obviously to the masters notify list, whatever it may be, without much effort  preferably without needing to rebuild the master app.p  pWhat Id really like is an easy messagingcommunication framework, which requires some simple configuration.p  pIm overwhelmed by the amount of frameworks and options out there...JMS, jgroups, the various MQ frameworks, RMI, Jini, etc, Web Services.p  pIm looking for fast, simple, reliable, and easy Any suggestions I dont need complex or particularly advanced features.p

Negative 42420 pthanks for reading  I am designing an interactive foreign language teaching tool using the D3js force bubble layout. In essence, users can select a language textbook chapter, part of speech, or specific word and the interface will display the words in a series of bubbles each clustered together by their part of speech adjective, noun, verb, etc.. These bubbles are free floating, no links between them.p  pWhen you click a word I have it open up more bubbles with information about that specific word lexeme, meaning in english, frequency, etc., but I want those bubbles to be attached to the original bubble with links. Im having a lot of trouble conceptualizing how to do this dynamically source  target, even though it should be pretty straightforward.p  pFirst I draw the bubbles based on user input, some of which

Negative 42420 pI am attempting to find out what is causing a runtime exception setParameters failed with my camera. So I ran my program in the eclipse debugger which normally works perfectly and stepped into the OSs or more specifically the Camera class setParameters method. Unfortunately it appears as if the correspondence between the code that is shown in the debug view is out of sync with the code being executed. For example at one point the cursor appears at the start of a multi line comment and then when I repeatedly clicked the step over button, the cursor advanced several times than jumped back four or five lines and started advancing again as if it was executing a small loop. But this was all going on within the bounds of a comment On further inspection, I did see a for loop not too far above the cursor that perhaps was being executed. p  pIs this a glitch that could possibly be correctedp  pstrongEDITstrong If I could modify the Camera class source code so I could add in some log messages, then that would be an alternative debugging route, but can that be donep

Negative 42420 pI am a java developer. My hard time i have to improve performance in production box when  150 concurrent users hits our applicationapp is deployed in weblogic server. p  pOur production system is configured with 4 JVM, 2 clustors. i found that each JVM has 12 processorsi am not sure, may be 3 per box, totally 12 processors.p  pPresently we deployed our JEE application in that weblogic which uses default thread pool. Weblogic version is 10.x. I know that, after version 8.1 we cant change the thread size of default threadpoolwork manager. Problem we are getting is our application works perfectly when 20 concurrent users hits our server4 JVMs. i see there are 8 threads created for each JVM and i assume there are  24 threads services the concurrent user requesttotally 4 box, so 24 threads. But we need to support totally 600 request and 150 request per JVMload balancer helps us here. But the problem is instead of handling all the request in the avg time of 300 ms it takes 8000 ms. it hurts us. p  pTo fix this i created a work manager with 75 threads and assigned to my application and i see the performance is imported significantly. Note there are 20 applications are deployed in the same weblogic. if i use 75 threads for my application how it will affect other application p  padvice me on this to handle 150 request without any lag. p

Negative 42420 pSo, as the title states, what Im trying to do is in MS Excel visual basic Im trying to write all in visual basic a SQL query that connects to a database and there are multiple cells that act as parameters. Right now Im focusing on just getting the query to return back the unfiltered results. I found a very basic example located here...p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17618796queryingatableinexcelwithparametersusingvbaAwesome query that a fellow stackoverflow member madeap  pI just straight copied the code he was having problems with and tested it out with my database and a very simple query. This all works fine and dandy.p  pThe issue that Im running into is I have a little more complex SQL query that I need to use and Im not quite sure on how the formatting should be in VB.p  pThe SQL query that I need to run is listed below. The database that Im using isnt very friendly either. When I try putting the entire query into the SQL string it gives me an error that just says SQL syntax error. And when I go to debug it shows the error on the .Refresh line. I realize this query is very large so I trimmed it down and made multiple lines in VB with double quotes marks around each sentence and combined them with amp . See very bottomp  pAnyone have any suggestionsp  pIf anyone wants the full code, let me know but its extremely similar to the link I posted above, just the ODBC connection information is different.p

In Column C I have the userid of the user who used it.p  pI want a table documenting which users used which numbers.p  pTable  So in K I created a column of unique numbers used in Column B. In Row 1 I listed the unique user IDs in column C.p  pI created a list of rowindexes with function Small of the rows belonging to each user. I then used the function Index to get the set of numbers used by the user. I then check for each of the cells in my table if the number in Column K is used by the user in Row 1.p  pThe table should be 860x21, but even for one cell it takes ages.p  pThe raw data is 3981 tuples of Number,ID in columns B,C respectivelyp  pIts been ages since I used excel. I believe the speedup is in the fact that there is no reuse in the calculations done for each cell, which are quite similar.p  pIn java, which i used to be very fluent in. I think this would be two forloops. One over the Ids getting their used numbers. And one over all the used numbers. Filling in truefalse for each number that is present in the users set. However excel recalculates users set everytime.p  pAny idea how to speed this up Or maybe a start on how to do this in vba, never used that before...p  pThanksp  pUPDATE THIS QUESTION IS SOLVED Thanks ALEXp

The problem I have is that I want an index at the top.  Originally it was just one line anchors to the H3s ID in each table.  That worked fine.  However, now I want to include export links along with the link to the onpage table and to get everything aligned I want to drop it into a table, but Im not sure how to do this.  To have each row in the same table requires having multiple codengrepeatcode iterators on what are essentially dummy elements, but I dont know that I can do that and generate valid markup inside of a codelttablegtcode.p  pIdeally, Id be able to do something like...p  precodelttr ngrepeatdist, style, gender, finishers in genders in styles in race.resultsgt   lttdgtlta hrefdiststylegenderresultsgtdist style genderltagtlttrgt   lttdgtlta href classdownloadgtCSVltagtlttdgt lttrgt codepre  pAngularJS requiring that all of its logic be attached to DOM elements means it requires generating unnecessary markup.  I saw one reference to creating a directive, which looked pretty foreign to me.  Im not opposed to learning the ins and outs of AngularJS, but this strikes me as something that ought to be straightforward.  In a templating system like Twig this would be a snap, but I feel like Im going to have to jump through a lot of hoops to accomplish this with AngularJS.p  pIs there a straightforward way to do this that doesnt involve all of the logic being inside of my controller  If the directive approach is the only option, so be it, but I would consider this a huge mark against AngularJS and my interest in pursuing it.p

Negative 42420 pI am learning Spring, and I know that bean will be by default singleton in one application context.But what if we deploy the applications in distributed system What will be the practical way to achieve singleton since every time a request comes in, it may be routed to a different machines with a different application contextp  pI have read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1194129singletoninclusterenvironmentSingleton in Cluster environmenta but the answer is about cache.p  pI guess we can do something like putting the singleton into a central placelike memcached , and every time we need this bean and serialize and deserialize it from IO, Does this work But, in my opinion,  this will be cost a lot in my opinion since some object is very expensive to transfer.p  pThank youp

Negative 42420 pI have a codeManagercode class that encapsulates a rather lowlevel facility e.g. database and serves as a factory for codeWorkercode instances, which p  ul liuse codeManagercodes underlying facility databaseli lireference codeManagercode from each instanceli liare used concurrentlyli lican launch asynchronous tasks which refer to the database in some detached thread.li ul  pThe codeManagercode also has a codeshutdowncode method that closes the database connection.

Thats cool for formatting to avoid having numbers break onto separate lines.  But for emparsingem it would depend on whether French users actually enter that character, or a normal space codeu0020code, or either one depending like maybe pasting from another source.

Negative 42420 pI plan on building a ROV and I am working on my video feed atm. I will be using fiber optics for all communications and I am tinkering with opencv to stream a webcam feed with python. I might choose to use IP cameras but I wanted to learn more about how to capture frames from a webcam in python first. Since I didnt know what I was going to use in the end I bought a cheapastheyget noname USB webcam just to try and get everything working. This camera feed is going to be used for navigation, a seperate video recorder will probably be used for recording video.p  pEnough about that, now to my issue. I am getting only 8 FPS when I am capturing the frames but I suspect that is due to the cheap webcam. The webcam is connected to a pcduino 3 nano which is connected to a arduino for controlling thrusters and reading sensors. I never thought of how to utilize hardware in encoding and decoding images, I dont know enough about that part yet to tell if I can utilize any of the hardware.p  pDo you guys believe its my web cam that is the bottleneck Is it a better idea to use a IP camera or should I be able to get a decent FPS using a webcam connected to a pcduino 3 nano capturing frames with opencv or perhaps some other way I tried capturing frames with Pygame which gave me the same result, I also tried mjpgstreamer.p  pIm programming in Python, this is the test I madep  precodeimport cv2, time FPS  0 cap  cv2.VideoCapture0  last  time.time  for i in range0,100     before  time.time     rval, frame  cap.read     now  time.time     printcap.read took   strnow  before     ifnow  last gt 1         printFPS         last  now         FPS  0     else         FPS  1 cap.release codepre  pAnd the result is in the line ofp  precodecap.read took 0.118262052536 cap.read took 0.118585824966 cap.read took 0.121902942657 cap.read took 0.116680860519 cap.read took 0.119271993637 cap.read took 0.117949008942 cap.read took 0.119143009186 cap.read took 0.122378110886 cap.read took 0.116139888763 8 codepre

My code is as followsp  precodeclass MyHWInterface  IDisposable      MyHWInterface              Dispose           private bool disposed  false      public void Dispose              Disposetrue         GC.SuppressFinalizethis           protected virtual void Disposebool disposing              if disposed                      CloseConnection             disposed  true                    private System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient Port  new System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient      public bool OpenConnection              ...           private bool SendCommandstring command              var strm  Port.GetStream  This throws the exception Cannot access disposed object         var w  new System.IO.StreamWriterstrm, System.Text.Encoding.ASCII         var r  new System.IO.StreamReaderstrm, System.Text.Encoding.ASCII         w.WriteLinecommand         w.Flush         string l  r.ReadLine         return l  OK           internal void CloseConnection              try                      SendCommandpower down now                  catch                           finally                      Port.Close                codepre  pMy problem is When my program ends, and my object of MyHWInterface therefore falls out of scope and then gets garbage collected. The destructor is called which tries to send the last command, which fails because somehow my TcpClient is already disposed.p  pPlease tell me why an object which is clearly not yet out of scope is being disposed. And please help with a method that makes sure my last command always will be send without an explicit call to Dispose.p

Negative 42420 pI am creating an Electronic Book and in every page of it there is a JPEG file. I have 224 pagespictures. Every picture is called from an HTML file. So i have 224 HTML files. p  pBut i am wondering if there is a way to create those HTML files dynamically every time the user clicks on my Electronic Book. But the files must be created before the user visits the page. Also i am thinking that maybe there are Electronic Books with more pagespictures 1000 for example. So in order to have statically so many HTML files it is better to create them dynamically when the user clicks and when the user leaves delete the HTML files.p  pSo i am looking for an HTML constructor.p  pThanks in advance. p
Negative 42420 pI want to create the config file dynamically as in runtime. I have a table named codeSettingscode in a database.

If not, then it should be redirected to the codeinstallercode page. Where the user will enter the necessary details and the config file will be generated accordingly and the same data will be stored in the codeSettingscode table for future use.p  pI dont want to hardcode any values into the config file. So, how can I achieve this task Any ideasp  pI have thought of an idea. What if I check the codeparamslocal.phpcode file for a param called codeinstalledcode with a value codetruecode. If it exists, we say that the application has been installed successfully else we take the user to the codeinstallercode page.p

Negative 42420 pIm trying to develop a query to help mix up results in a search request in MongoDB. An example and very simplified version of my collection looks like this. Each document has a location to query, a ranking on the quality of the listing, and the name of a provider who inserted the listing.p  precode[        location paris,     ranking 998,     provider Alpha   ,        location paris,     ranking 965,     provider Alpha   ,        location paris,     ranking 945,     provider Alpha   ,        location paris,     ranking 933,     provider Alpha   ,        location paris,     ranking 953,     provider Alpha   ,        location paris,     ranking 983,     provider Alpha   ,        location paris,     ranking 700,     provider Beta   ,        location paris,     ranking 745,     provider Beta   ,        location paris,     ranking 670,     provider Omega   ,        location paris,     ranking 885,     provider Omega   ,        location paris,     ranking 500,     provider Omega   ,        location london,     ranking 600,     provider Omega   ,        location london,     ranking 650,     provider Beta    ] codepre  pAs you can see, provider Alpha has the most listings, and the best rankings. So when I search paris and sort by ranking, all the listings from the Alpha provider get put on top, and the Betas and Omegas shoved off to the bottom. p  pWhat Id like to do is limit each provider to 3. So that even though Alphas will still be on top, theyll be limited to 3 allowing for the Betas and Omegas to be higher up. And then the remaining Alphas can be seen on page 2 when .skip is used.p  pIf I was to do this in Python, a synchronous example would look like this. p  precodeusrbinenv python   coding utf8   results  []  providersAvailable  colc.findlocation paris.distinctprovider for provider in providersAvailable     search  colc.findproviderprovider, location paris.limit3     results  results  listsearch  return sortedresults, keylambda k k[ranking]  codepre  pThis is heavy, time consuming, and overall just sucks, espicially with a collection of 2.5 million documents. How could I do this all on Mongos side Thanksp

Negative 42420 pI have a csv file that contains many thousands of timestamped data points. The file includes the following columns Date, Tag, East, North amp DistFromMean.

Negative 42420 pWe are in a situation where we have one general modules repository which is shared between different project repositories. The problem we face is that if you go back to an earlier version of a project, we cannot really know which general modules revision has been used with this project. We could check the date and time stamp and see if they match, but there must be another more elegant way to do this. The general modules repository doesnt change as frequently as the projects itself. My question is how do you deal with this and what are the best practicesp

Negative 42420 pIm looking for a way to create a debug version of my app that I can send to testers in other countries that would otherwise be geogated to normal users. I can normally set up a proxy server for this but it can be time consuming for a simple tester and setting the trueip from within the app as a debugging feature would be the best solution.

Negative 42420 pI implemented a periodic sync adapter into my app with a stub authenticator and content provider following this a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comtrainingsyncadaptersindex.html relnofollowtutoriala. Upon studying my data usage amounts of my app via settings, it seems that the sync adapter uses an overhead of 10 kb of data each sync even after I removed all code from onPerformSync. This is undesirable as that is often larger than the actual amount of data that I want to sync. Does anyone know why this happens and how I can get rid ofminimize it As I said, I dont needuse all the accountautheticatorcontent provider stuff, I just need the sync adapter to wake up my service and execute my own sync code.p  pEDIT Looks like the settings monitor is just inaccurate. I used TrafficStats and the readings now seem correct. However, that is another problem as I dont want users to look at the settings reading and think I am using data that I am not. Any suggestionsp

Negative 42420 pI created a class that would generate a hud item, this hud item can animate the resulting texture which is a gradient created using cicolor that is then saved into a uiimage which is in turn used for an sktexture.

Negative 42420 pLet me be clear, the method I describe below is operational. Im hoping to improve the throughput of the method. It works, and it works quite well. Were looking to scale throughput even more which is why Im looking into this.p  pThe task at hand is to improve the performance of a scoring algorithm which returns the best score for a collection of tasks. I have collection of tasks that I perform the scoring on using an codeExecutorServicecode. Each task checks to see if it now has the best score, and updates the best score in a synchronized fashion if it is the new best. To give some insight into the scale Im working at, Each task takes a fraction of a millisecond to complete, but there are thousands of them, resulting in several hundred milliseconds to find the best one. I execute this scoring algorithm several hundred times a minute. The result is that 30 second out of 60 is spent running this scoring algorithm.p  pWhen my thread pool is 8 threads with 24 virtual cores, the tasks take 0.3 ms each. When I have 20 threads same machine, 24 virtual cores the tasks take 0.6 ms each. I suspect that as I add more threads to my codeExecutorServicecode thread pool that my performance is getting worse because of this synchronization on the best score more threads contending for the lock.p  pI have done quite a bit of searching, but cant seem to find satisfactory actually, I cant seem to find any alternatives. Im thinking about collecting all scores and either storing in sorted order, or sorting after all tasks are completedbut Im unsure if this will be any improvement.p  pDoes anyone have any thoughts of another, more efficient way of collecting the best scorep  pHeres the current methodologyp  precodefinal double[] bestScore   Double.MAXVALUE   for each item in the collection      tasks.addExecutors.callablenew Runnable          public void run              double score  ... do the scoring for the task             if score lt bestScore[0]                  synchronizedbestScore                      if score lt bestScore[0]   check again after we have the lock                         bestScore[0]  score                         ...                          also save off other task identifiers in a similar fashion                                                                    end of loop creating scoring tasks  ListltFutureltObjectgtgt futures  executorService.invokeAlltasks ...timeout params here ...  handle cancelled tasks    now use the best scoring task that was saved off when it was found. codepre

Furthermore, I am using the ResXFileCodeGenerator to generate a class which retrieves the resources in the UICulture.p  pNow my application installs all of its libraries except the UI libraries in the GAC WindowsMicrosoft.NETassemblyGAC32.p  pFor each library a LibraryName and LibraryName.resources is installed. My application can either run with a GUI or from the console. There are two solutions for this. The UI application uses the UI libraries and the other only the libraries containing the logic.p  pWith the UI application everything works well. If I set it to English, it shows everything in English. If I set it to another language, it shows everything in that language.p  pHowever, the console application shows everything in English, no matter which language is set. When debugging, I can see that the UICulture is set correctly and that it is correctly recognized, but somehow the ResourceManager does not retrieve the localized resource.p  pWhen debugging I can also see that the ResourceManager has a field called lookedForSatelliteContractVersion. This is set to false. In the working case it is set to true.p  pWhat can the problem be Something with the references of the Console solution Something with the solution settings of the Console solutionp

Negative 42420 pStraight to the point. In my app, the server response and errors are shown in form of dialogs. For Examplep  precodefor an IOxception protected void handleIOExceptionIOException ioex              int count  connReq.getSilentRetryCount             if count gt 0                  count                 retry              else                  Notification is a special implementation of the                 LWUIT Dialog that disposes after 3 seconds                 Notification.notifyUserData connection failed.

The Progress dialog is the Progress in LWUIT4IO. It is set to dispose on completion. Disposing any of the dialogs also disposes the Progress dialog. However, I want the Progress dialog disposed first. Is there a way I can wait for the Progress dialog to be disposed before showing any other dialogp

Negative 42420 pIm new here and have recently started using AutoIt alongside selenium to perform automation testing on my web application. Im currently stuck with a situation where I want to automate testing on a drag and drop element the user can drag and drop a file from their desktopfolder into the web application. I know in selenium I can simply send the file path into the web element, but in this scenario I want to be able to test the functionality of the drag and drop. p  pIm currently using the AutoItx4java bridge and programming in java. To sum things up, I need help creating a script that opens a folder and drags and drops the item at a given coordinate. These coordinates are determined in selenium so I cant simply use an exe since I would need to enter the coordinates as parameters. I understand how to do this strictly from an AutoIt script, but am having difficulty doing it with an AutoItX object in java. Im also unsure why the following code does not open the folder in the specified directory.p  precodeAutoItX x  new AutoItX String path  CFile.separatorUsers x.runexplorer.exe, path codepre  pWhat am I doing incorrectly or is there a different method for automating this that I should look at Any advice would help and thanks for your time. p

Negative 42420 pI want to have a text to be overlayed on top of a bitmap that inside an EaselJs canvas. p  pIn my code, the image was loaded using PreloadJS first thing. Then the text was added later after that. Both of them start at x  0, y  0 with different widths and heights. Thus in order to display the text, I need to have it on top of the image. p  pI have a method to display either text or image based on the parameter, i.e DisplayObj. So basically, I have to call DisplayObjimg followed by DisplayObjtext. However, this will result in the text is displayed behind the image. If I change my code that instead of doing 2 function calls, I just put the logic of displaying the text after the displaying image, call only 1 time and it worked. However, this is not what I want since sometimes, the text and image are not needed to be overlayed each other, thus this approach seems not quite well.p  pAny suggestions on how to do this with Easel and jQueryp  pBelow is my function written in Typescriptp  precodefunction DisplayContentObjectcxml any JQueryPromiseltanygt  var deferred JQueryDeferredltanygt  .Deferred var promise JQueryPromiseltanygt  deferred.promise  if cxml.attributes.isvisible.value  1      if cxml.attributes.type.value.toLowerCase.indexOftext gt 1          let x number  cxml.attributes.contentpos.value.split,[0]         let y number  cxml.attributes.contentpos.value.split,[1]         let width number  cxml.attributes.contentsize.value.split,[0]         let height number  cxml.attributes.contentsize.value.split,[1]         var text  cxml.attributes.data.value         var textElement  new createjs.Texttext, 16px Times New Roman, 00F         textElement.x  x  10         textElement.y  y  10          textElement.lineWidth  width         textElement.maxWidth  width         textElement.lineHeight  20          stage.addChildtextElement         stage.update         displayContentDeffered.resolve          if cxml.attributes.type.value.toLowerCase.indexOfaudio gt 1          var fe string  cxml.attributes.filename.value.split.[1].toLowerCase         if fe  swf           else if fe  mp3              createjs.Sound.stop             createjs.Sound.addEventListenerfileload, SoundFileLoaded             createjs.Sound.alternateExtensions  [mp3]             createjs.Sound.registerSound id audio, src mediapath  cxml.attributes.filename.value                   displayContentDeffered.resolve          if cxml.attributes.type.value.toLowerCase.indexOfvisual gt 1          var file string  cxml.attributes.filename.value         if file.indexOfswf  1              let x number  cxml.attributes.contentpos.value.split,[0]             let y number  cxml.attributes.contentpos.value.split,[1]             let w number  cxml.attributes.contentsize.value.split,[0]             let h number  cxml.attributes.contentsize.value.split,[1]             var manifest  [                                      src mediapath  file,                     id img, x x, y y, w w, h h                              ]             preload  new createjs.LoadQueuetrue             preload.oncomplete, ImageFileLoaded, this             preload.loadManifestmanifest          else             displayContentDeffered.resolve       else      if cxml.attributes.type.value.toLowerCase.indexOfaudio gt 1          var fe string  cxml.attributes.filename.value.split.[1].toLowerCase         if fe  swf           else if fe  mp3              createjs.Sound.stop             createjs.Sound.addEventListenerfileload, SoundFileLoaded             createjs.Sound.alternateExtensions  [mp3]             createjs.Sound.registerSound id audio, src mediapath  cxml.attributes.filename.value                    displayContentDeffered.resolve      return displayContentPromise  codepre  pThe function takes an XMLObject that contains information it should be display.

Negative 42420 pFrom what Ive read, there appears to be marginal performance benefits using stored procedures vs simply building the commands in C and calling them explicitly in the programs code, at least when it comes to machines that share the server program and db engine and when the procedures are simple. Most people seem to think its a preference issue, and add a few other minor benefits to justify their case.p  pHowever, one I couldnt find any information on, is the benefit of a stored procedure when the database engine is located on a separate physical machine from the main application.p  pIf I am not mistaken, in a server farm, wouldnt a stored procedure offload the processing on some cpu threads from the main server application, and have the primary processing done on the db engine servers cpu instead Or, is this already done on the db engines cpu anyways, when the C libraries build the information for the db engine to processp  pSpecifically, I have a longrunning transaction that I could do multiple calls in a C transaction block, but I suspect that a stored proc will in fact have a huge performance benefit by reducing the network calls to the db engine, as well as guaranteeing the processing is not being done on the main server application.p  pIs this truep
