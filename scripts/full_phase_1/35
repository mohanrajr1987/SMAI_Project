Positive 35 pI would like to create an app that talks to the users computer so Id like to create a server with a REST API. What is the best way to go about doing this I looked into WCF but that seems overkill and most tutorials I see seems its more suitable to a server backend than being installed on a user computer. p  pAre there other more suitable frameworks in C that I can use to create a REST API on all user machines as opposed to using socketsp  pThanksp  pEdit Apologies for the lack of clarity. I would like to develop an app on iOS and Android that talks to the users machine. In order to do this, I need a server on the users machine that will perform the actions that I request from the mobile device. I want to avoid using sockets as a REST API will suffice and makes development easier. I believe WCF can achieve this but might be overkill for a simple app that talks to a users machine. Web API seeems like something that would be the solution but happy to hear if Im taking a wrong approach to this.p
Positive 35 pIve encountered a case where using codewritecode serverside on a remotely closed client doesnt return 0.p  pAccording to man 2 codewritecode p  blockquote   pOn success, the number of bytes written is returned zero indicates   nothing was written.  On error, 1 is returned, and errno is set   appropriately.p blockquote  pFrom my understanding when using codereadcodecodewritecode on a remotely closed socket, the first attempt is supposed to fail thus return code0code, and the next try should trigger a broken pipe.

On the server side, when a user connects to the server, it requires channel and message parameters to complete communication cycle.p  pHere is where I get confused. How is the logic works for my case I can understand the logic of public chat use, but couldnt figure out for notification system.p  pIs it like are all these sending notification info data function supposed to be triggered when inserting it to database with unique channel name maybe UID and preset messages for predefined actions eg. UserX started following youp  pBy that, I am planning to use Bootstrap dropdowns and appending the notification data in that dropdown with javascript.p

Positive 35 phere is a small client GUI program written in c. The idea is first the client will send an id typed in the textboxto serverpressing the check button, the server will check that id and if its valid the server will return a value 0 otherwise 1. Now if the return value is 1, then the client will again take an input in the checkbox and send it to the server for another checkby pressing the check button. This process will go on until the client receives a 0 from the server. But, In my code, when I make an invalid input in the textbox, it hangs as well as the check button. So, I cant repeat the proces of sending a valid id to server.

Positive 35 pdo you recommend the Mono for high performance Unixbased TCP socket server with thousands of concurrent connections p  pWe are investigating the Mono platform for our Unixbased master server TCP socket server which should be able to handle at least 10005000 persistent connections. It must run on Unix platform because our tech infrastucture is already built on this ecosystem and ready to use. Another big benefit is that our game client is build in Unity, so using the same technology for client and server looks very prospective for us. p  pI already found and tried a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles83102CSocketAsyncEventArgsHighPerformanceSocketCod relnofollowhigh performance implementation using SocketAsyncEventArgsa on Ubuntu and the results are pretty cool. It was able to process 4000 messages per second with 1000 opened connections. There is also a hrefhttpsgithub.comkerryjiangSuperSocket relnofollowSocketServer frameworka which looks quiet interesting. p  pHowever, I am little bit sceptical about other possible drawbacksp  ol liNot sure if the Mono implementation of the SocketAsyncEventArgs is fully replacable to .NET implementation on Windows. Is it ready for production in the current state li liNot sure if this is still issue with last versions but I found many hate comments targeting Mono performance. Is Mono comparable to other highlevel languages like JavaC.NET in the question of performance li liYou know it looks like there is not many people which are going this server way with Mono. Also we want to focus primarily on business logic rather then polish and hack core server functionality. So, is it possible to rapidly prototype relatively stable framework around Mono or we will need to solve many hidden secrets and issues li liLooks like the future of Mono is in crossplatform mobile market not servers. we are looking forward to next few years li liThere is also competition which have also its pros and cons e.g. JavaNetty, Node.js and is better in some aspects. li ol

So I have some text files that represent the nodes and inside there is a list of neighbors.br I use localhost as the IP and the port is the number of the node.p  pThe problem is when I receive a message that I sent from a node like 7000, python replaces it with a random number for example 65724. So now my father is 65724 instead of 7000, so I cannot remove 7000 from the list of neighbors.br I cannot complete my algorithm and that is very frustrating. p  pI can send a message with the port number that I want, but its not very elegant.p  pCould someone tell me how to not allow python to randomize the portp  prmunn saved me, the answer I was looking far is the bind before connect method.

Positive 35 pIm using Laravel5 and, I want to create a notification system for my web project. What I want to do is, notifying the user for new notifications such asp  ul lianother user starts following him,li lianother user writes on his wall,li lianother user sends him a message, etc, li ul  pby possibly highlighting an icon on the header with a dropdown menu. The ones such as StackOverflow.p  pI found out the new tutorials on Laracast Realtime Laravel with Socket.io, where a kind of similar thing is achieved by using Node, Redis and Socket.io.p  pIf I choose using socket.io and I have 5000 users online, I assume I will have to make 5000 connections, 5000 broadcastings plus the notifications, so it will make a lot of number of requests. And I need to start for every user on login, on the master blade, is that truep  pIs it a bad way of doing it I also think same thing can be achieved with Ajax requests. Should I tend to avoid using too many continuous ajax requestsp  pI want to ask if Socket.io is a good way of logic for creating such system, or is it a better approach to use Ajax requests in 5 seconds instead Or is there any alternative better way of doing it Pusher can be an alternative, however, I think free is a better alternative in my case.p

Positive 35 pim in a bit confusion out there, i obviously know that P2P peer2peer is used for file sharing. and i have heard that Skype application is using P2P for its communication, i mean like if a host want to do a video chat it goes through P2P protocol in Skype app, i obviously am not sure about that, but i heard of it in YouTube and some website around the web. so my question is that would P2P make a client inside a private network access another network client being private either.  to be precise, i want a host from a private network access a files from another private networks host. like myself access a file from my neighbors network files. am i going to be able to use P2P there hope that do not make any confusion.

Positive 35 pRIO here stands for the Windows 8 Registered IO Networking extensions.

Positive 35 pI have several kernel modules which need to interact with userspace. Hence, each module has a Netlink socket.p  pMy problem is that these sockets interfere with each other.

Or, better yet, I wish I could bind my sockets to other pids.

Port 0 zero is reserved for the kernel and refers to the kernel side socket of each netlink protocol family. Other port numbers usually refer to user space owned sockets, although this is not enforced.p blockquote  pThat last claim seems to be a lie right now.

Positive 35 pI am developing an application using Socket IO that needs to be scaled across multiple servers. This is being achieved through socket.ioredis, which essentially interconnects all of my servers running socket IO and treats Redis as a datastore that all of my serversnodes running Socket IO publish messages from.p  pFor better context, here is a diagram from MSDN that outlines my setupp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commqkp3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commqkp3.png altsocketio setupap  pHeres my issuep  pIf Client A sends a message only intended for Client C to receive, I feel its a waste of bandwidth to publish a message to Client B and D. My idea is that I would, on the serverside, record user ids and their corresponding open socket ids. Then when a client sends a message, I would do do a lookup and find a users socket ids and publish the messages. This seems fine and dandy as well as heavily reliant on a robust system to keep that table of user ids and socket ids up to date, but there are two questions I have about implementing this systemp  p1 Is it more memory efficient to emit messages to only relevant socket ids, rather than to an entire channel across every server I realize that with 4 total clients, this problem is very small, but imagine if I had 2000 concurrent users across 2 servers. If 1 client sends a message intended for 2 clients, I imagine sending a message to 1997 other clients is more taxing than sending to just those 2 socket ids, unless io.sockets.connected[socketid].emit is not efficient. Example belowp  precodesocket.onchat message, functionmsg     io.emitchat message, msg  codepre  pvs.p  precodefor i  0 i lt relevantsockets.length i       io.sockets.connected[relevantsockets[i]].emitchat message, msg  codepre  p2 Since Im using multiple servers, are socket ids guaranteed to be unique Im hoping the redis module is handling this since its entire purpose is to link processes and servers, but I just want to be sure.p  pThanks ahead of time for any help.p

Positive 35 pIm new to Winsock. I am writing an HTTP server and I am aiming to send a large file by reading and sending in chunks. To optimize this process, I attempt to use a nonblocking socket where I read the next chunk from the disk while I send the current one.p  pMy problem now is that I get an FDWRITE message even when it seems the buffer should be full and my function deletes the associated data from memory prematurely. I believe this causes my responses contain less data than they should send stops sending prematurely and the client which is a wellknown one receives about 70 of the data. When I use blocking sockets it works fine, its just longer.p  pI tried using Wget, a simple HTTP client, to get a better idea of whats going on. From what I can see, the datastream thins out when I detect WSAEWOULDBLOCK errors when checking for errors after using send. It looks like during those sends, not all the data gets sent.p  pWhen I set the sleep time to over 2000ms after checking for the FDWRITE message, everything works as it basically comes down to using a blocking socket. I also tried setting times around 100200ms, but those fail as well.

Negative 35 pUser equals untrustworthy. Never trust untrustworthy users input. I get that. However, I am wondering when the best time to sanitize input is. For example, do you blindly store user input and then sanitize it whenever it is accessedused, or do you sanitize the input immediately and then store this cleaned version Maybe there are also some other approaches I havent though of in addition to these. I am leaning more towards the first method, because any data that came from user input must still be approached cautiously, where the cleaned data might still unknowingly or accidentally be dangerous. Either way, what method do people think is best, and for what reasonsp

Negative 35 pemDisclaimer  Im completely clueless about .net and COM.emp  pI have a vendors application that appears to be written in .net and Im trying to wrap it with a web form a cgibin Perl script so I can eventually launch this vendors app from a separate computer.  Im on a Windows Server 2003 R2 SE SP1 system and Im using Apache 2.2 for the web server and ActivePerl 5.10.0.1004 for the cgi script.  My cgi script calls the vendors app that resides on the same machine using the Perl backtick operator.  p  precode... result  Result  . vendorsPathvendorsExecutable arg1 arg2 ... codepre  pRight now Im just running IE web browser locally on the server machine and accessing httplocalhostcgibinmyPerlScript.pl.

This problem is likely security related because the whole thing runs just fine on a Windows XP Pro machine both command line and web invocation.  I actually developed my web script there and got it completely working there before I tried moving it to the Windows Server 2003 machine.  So whats different about the Windows Server 2003 machine that would keep the vendors .net app from being executed successfully by a web cgi script  p  pCan I fix this problem somehow to make it work on my server or will the vendor have to make a change to their .net app and ship out a new version  Im probably the only person in the world who is trying to execute this vendors app from a separate program, so I hate to bother the vendor with the issue if theres a workaround that I can implement myself here on my server machine.  Plus, Im in kind of a hurry and I dont want to wait 4 or 6 months for the vendor to put in a fix and deploy a new version.  p  pThanks for any advise you can give.p

Negative 35 pI recently found an interesting issue. When using SetEnvironmentVariable, I can use Process Explorer to get the newly created environment variable. However when the process itself is 32 bit and the OS as 64 bit, Process Explorer at least v10  the latest v11.33 cannot find the new variables. If the program is native 64 bit then everything works fine, just as well as 32 bit process running on 32 bit OS.p  pThe SetEnvironmentVariable API call should be successful, because the return value is TRUE and calling GetEnvironmentVariable returns correct value. Also if you create a child process, you can find the variable was correctly set in the new process by using Process Explorer.p  pIm not if this is the limitation of SysWOW64 or a bug in Process Explorer. Anyone knowsp  pAnd, is there any way to get the 32 bit environment variables correctly for example, force Process Explorer to run in 32 bit mode, or some other toolsp  pSample source to reproducep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltwindows.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]      printfsetting variable... sn,          SetEnvironmentVariableanewvar, 1.0  OK  FAILED     printfpress anykey to continue...n     getchar      systemargv[0]  uncomment to inspect the child process     return 0  codepre

Negative 35 pFirst, a disclaimer. I know a little about regexs but Im no expert. They seem to be something that I really need twice a year so they just dont stay on top of my brain. p  pThe situation Id like to write a regex to match a certain word, lets call it Ostrich. Easy. Except Ostrich can sometimes appear inside of a curly brace. If its inside of a curly brace its not a match. The trick here is that there can be spaces inside the curly braces. Also the text is typically inside of a paragraph.  p  pThis should match  codeI have an Ostrich.code p  pThis should not match  codeMy Emu went to the Ostrich Race Name.code p  pThis should be a match  codeMy Ostrich went to the Ostrich Race Name.code p  pThis should not be a match  codeMy Emu went to the Race Ostrich Place.

Negative 35 pI have about 100 databases all the same structure, just on different servers with approx a dozen tables each. Most tables are small lets say 100MB or less. There are occasional edgecases where a table may be large lets say 4GB.p  pI need to run a series of ALTER TABLE commands on just about every table in each database. Mainly adding some rows to the structure, but a few changes like change a row from a varchar to tinytext or vice versa. Also adding a few new indexes but indexing new rows, not existing ones, so assuming that isnt a big deal.p  pI am wondering how safe this is to do, and if there are any best practices to this process.p  pFirst, is there any chance I may corrupt or delete data in the tables.

Negative 35 pI am trying to build a domain model that will allow me to manage Contracts.p  pThe Contract class is my aggregate root, and it has a single property right now, which is Reviewers.p  pReviewers, in the context of the Contract, each have a property to its parent Contract, and a First Name, Last Name, and Login.  The reason they have these properties is so I can have the user select which Reviewers they want on a Contract.p  pThe database that Im tying my domain model to already exists, and its a legacy system that Im trying to extend.p  pIt has a Contract Table, and a Reviewer Table.p  pThe thing I havent mentioned up until this point, is that Reviewers are actually Users in the system.  So theres actually a third table involved, which is Users.p  pI have been able to map my Contract Table easily with FNH.p  pIt looks something like thisp  precodepublic class ContractMapping ClassMapltContractgt      public ContractMapping              Idc gt c.Id         HasManyc gt c.AdditionalReviewers       codepre  pBut Im not sure how to model my Reviewers, because they are in fact Users as well.  So my object model looks like thisp  precodepublic class Reviewer User      public virtual Guid Id  get set       public virtual Contract Contract  get set    public class User      public virtual Guid Id  get set       public virtual string Login  get set      public virtual string FirstName  get set      public virtual string LastName  get set           codepre  pIve been able to map my User class properly, and it looks something like thisp  precodepublic class UserMapping ClassMapltUsergt      public UserMapping              Idu gt u.Id         Mapu gt u.Login         Mapu gt u.FirstName         Mapu gt u.LastName       codepre  pand I believe I want to map my Reviewer class like thisp  precodepublic class ReviewerMapping SubclassMapltReviewergt      public ReviewerMapping              TableReviewer          Idr gt r.Id.ColumnReviewerId lt wont compile         Referencesr gt r.Contract.ColumnContractId       codepre  pSo the problem Im having is thisp  pThe relationship between the User table and the Reviewer table is one to many.  Meaning, for a given User there may be many Reviewer records.  Why  Because a User has to be a Reviewer for a specific Contract.  This causes an issue with the mapping, though, because the primary key for my Reviewer and the primary key for my User are completely different values, by necessity.p  pAlso, because of the way Im using Reviewer, when I create a new Reviewer, what Im really trying to do is to associate a User with a Contract.  I am strongnotstrong trying to create an entirely new User in the database.p  pWhat is the correct way for me to map Reviewer, knowing that in my domain model it is a subclass of Userp

Negative 35 pIm trying to reverse engineer an old medical imaging format called Stentor for interoperability. It was designed by a company of the same name who was subsequently bought by Phillips. But Phillips has forgotten how to read Stentor files. I have a windows program which exports JPEG from Stentor files but its closed source. Id like to automate this process in order to tackle hundreds of files in this format.p  pThe program is late1990s Win32 or MFC executeable. It runs next to an ActiveX .ocx file which Ive been able to interop with, but that file doesnt contain the export method. Im looking for suggestions on how to dissemble the binary in order to unearth the algorithm used to convert Stentor to JPEG. I looked through the Stentor files in hex editor and didnt find any evidence of JPEG although hints on finding that would be appreciated too, so I think that the program has a couple of tricks up its sleeve.p  pThanks in advance.p  pKylep

Negative 35 pIm writing a universal iOS app that a text entry component to it. When the view with the UITextView in it is shown, I call [UITextView becomeFirstResponder] so the keyboard pops up. When the user taps donesave, the view controller calls pop on its navigation controller, and the keyboard emshouldem disappear automatically.p  pThis works fine on the iPhoneiPod touch, but on the iPad, the keyboard remains up, with the accessory view, even after the view is popped. Ive tried everything checking leaks with Instruments, static analyzer, explicitly calling [UITextView resignFirstResponder] multiple times, heap shots, and no matter what I cant get the keyboard to disappear once the view controller is popped or figure out why the heck it wouldnt be. This is a huge issue because the previous view controller in the UINavigationController hierarchy doesnt have a text field, and the accessory view remains on top of the keyboard and when the buttons on it are tapped, they send messages to the deallocated view controller, causing a crash.p  pThe only difference I can name between the iPhoneiPad version is that the iPhone version, of course, presents the navigation controller modally over the full screen, while on the iPad the navigation controller is presented in UIModalPresentationFormSheet.p  pI hope this is enough information to allow someone to diagnose the issue. If its not, Ill post a sample project.p

Negative 35 pThere are times when a programmer clearly has made a deliberate choice in their code structure that results in behaviour that is at best unintuitive but not technically a bug in that its broken.  Should this be classified as a bug and fixed p  pFor example, a wellknown open source ecommerce system if you look at my answer history, youll work out which one provides functionality for Quantity Increments where an administrator can specify the multiple of units that must added to the cart e.g. must be 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.  The code is written so that these limits are only enforced when the system is in Manage Stock mode i.e. inventory levels are decremented with each order.  Now, it is an entirely valid situation that a store owner may wish to sell their product in specified increments, but not manage stock levels. The code ignores the configuration silently no feedback to the admin and theres no documentation of the requirement for Manage Stock to be turned on. p  pIs this a bug  Or just poor designdocumentation.  p  pNote, Im sure that some readers will interpret this question as subjective, but I think there is an important different between bugs and poor design. This is particularly relevant in open source projects where bug reporting tends to work in different processes than internal company systems. p
Negative 35 pI am in the process of putting a new site together which will make use of AJAX to pull through page content should the user have javascript enabled.p  pSo, I am in the situation whereby every Action Method requires a check to see if the request was through AJAX or not, which is straightforward. If the request was through AJAX then I can return a partialview, if not then a full view can be returned.p  pWith this pattern though, Ill need to create a View and a PartialView for every page on the site. The only real difference between them is going to the inclusion of the masterpage.p  pAm I missing a trick here is is this doubling up of views the only way to gop  pThanksp  pEDIT  a bit more infop  pLets say I had a page that could get accessed through codesitetestcode. Somewhere in my JS I would add a hash to the url like so codesitetestcode. JS would then watch for any hash changes and load the partial views as needed. If JS was not available though, an entire view would need to be returned. p  pSo for each page I would need the view, which would then include a call to RenderPartial which would load up the partial view which would actually contain the page content. So, for every page there are two files. It just seems there should be a cleaner way of doing this.p

Negative 35 pIve spent days reading and rereading every tutorials Ive found on the subject, and spent hours and even days browsing related questions here at SO, but I still cant get the following to work. Accept my apologies if this is a duplicate chances are that Ive seen and reread many times the duplicate questions but couldnt understand the relevance of the answers to my problem. With that out of the way...p  pIm trying to implement a plugin architecture for my Application. Plugins are compiled and installed as libraries. At run time, the Application then uses dlopen  dlsym to load and link to the plugins functions.br The idea is that plugins libraries will implement a set of functions to return data to the main Application, or manipulate data passed from the Application.  p  pIn order to test this idea, I tried to implement a function inside the plugin that would return the human readable name of the plugin itself as a stdstring.

What Im trying to do with a simple stdstring, I wish to do later with much more complex objects i.e. a plugin function would take an object by reference and change some of its properties.  The tutorials more or less all stop at the point of creating a pointer with dlsym and do not give much examples on how to use this pointer.  p  pSo, how to do all thatp  pAnother pertinent question do I use a common header that Id use both with the Application and with the plugin and where Id define the function calls signature How would I do this and how would that helpp

Negative 35 pPicture this... A program GUI JFrame that is split in 2, EAST and WEST. The first JPanel is just a print preview screen. The EAST side of the JFrame is where the user can create a 1 2 or 3 size image. The user clicks the Add button and the defined image on the right goes to the panel on the left. So if the user clicks Add 3 times with different size images, then the panel uses FlowLayout to organize the added panel images added on the left.p  pWhen you run this code, you can see a sorta idea of what I want. Really what would be nice is to create all this offscreen and call it MainPanel. Then have printPreview extend MainPanel and scale it down for screen view. And have the Printable method paint the MainPanel into the print method which would be a correct size.p  pSo my question... Can you copy or paint a JPanel before it is rendered on the screen  Is there a better way to do what I want, I FlowLayout solves what I want amazingly, so a JPanel seems to be the answer unless there is something I do not know of.p  pOk now that that is pictured.

Negative 35 pI have a Class  API that uses an codeIQueryableltFirstClassgtcode data source however I wish to expose an codeIQueryableltSecondClassgtcode, where codeSecondClasscode is a wrapper class for codeFirstClasscode that exposes nearly identical properties, however for various reasons needs to inherit from an unrelated base class.  For examplep  precode My API void IQueryableltSecondClassgt GetCurrentRecords      return from row in dataSource             Linq query             select new SecondClassrow    User of my API var results  GetCurrentRecords.Whererow gt row.Owner  Mike codepre  pNow I can make the above compile simply by using codeAsQueryablecode however I want to expose a true codeIQueryablecode that efficiently queries the database based on the API users query.p  pI know that this isnt trivial my wrapper IQueryable implementation needs to understand the relationship between the properties of codeSecondClasscode and codeFirstClasscode, and that it has nothing to do with the codeSelectcode function, but it emseemsem like it should be possible.p  pHow do I do thisp  pstrongNotestrong I know that instead my API could just expose codeFirstClasscode along with a helper method to convert codeFirstClasscode to codeSecondClasscode for when the API user is done creating their query, but it feels messy and I dont like the idea of exposing my generated classes in this way.  Also Id like to know how to do the above anyway just from a purely academic standpoint.p

Negative 35 pI am a beginner to programming, and a beginner to ObjectiveC. I learned basic C and decided to start learning ObjectiveC. I am reading Programming in Objective C 2.0 by Steven Kochan.  His section on Protocols is vague. He doesnt thoroughly explain WHY someone would want to use protocols in their programs, nor does he give a concrete example with it implemented in a program. He writes You can use a protocol to define methods that you want other people who subclass your class to implement. He also says that Protocols are good for subclasses to be able to implement certain methods, without having to first define the actual methods. He also says protocols can be used across different classes because they are classless.p  pI know there must be a valid and smart way to implement protocols, but based on what he wrote, I dont see why someone would use protocols instead of just creating a class method outside of the reason that more than one class can adhere to a protocol I know there are some more good reasons though. I was wondering if someone could help me understand how, why and when I would use Protocols in my program in an intelligent way.p

Negative 35 pI am writing a Tetrisbased game, and I am using a GridLayout to display the actual shaft which the Tetris pieces fall down. The GridLayout is filled with little JLabel objects. The shaft is itself a JPanel inside another JPanel, the panel I am using to contain and control the entire game. When the game ends, I want the words GAME OVER to appear on top of the grid, possibly accompanied by a small image. p  pMy shaft is an instance of ShaftPanel, which extends JPanel so that I could override paintComponent and is a nested private class so it has access to private instance variables of the larger JPanel. The private instance variable it needs to access is boolean game, which is true when the game is in session and set to false when the game is over. Here is the code for my ShaftPanel class p  precodepublic class ShaftPanel extends JPanel   public ShaftPanelGridLayout g   superg   public void paintComponentGraphics g   super.paintComponentg    ifgame     return    g.setColorColor.WHITE   g.setFontnew FontCourier New, Font.BOLD, 15   char[] c  G,A,M,E, ,O,V,E,R    g.drawCharsc,0,c.length,45,45  codepre  pp  pI have one method in the larger class calling the repaint method of shaft at the appropriate time. Adding a print statement indicates that the paintComponent method is being called when I want it to, and the setColor, setFont, drawChars methods are all being called at the correct times. However, nothing shows up. I highly suspect that the text is being drawn underneath the grid of JLabels, so that it cant be seen, but I dont know how to fix this problem. The JLabels inside the grid have to stay opaque, because the program relies on them being different colors. Is there a way to tell paintComponent to draw the text on top of anything else in the panel p
Negative 35 pHey all. I have the following codep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netg7Cgghttpjsfiddle.netg7Cggap  pAs you can see, there are 2 simple DIVs that are stacked one above each other. Each of these DIVs are also set to be resizable and draggable. However, notice when you attempt to resize the first element, the second element collapses onto the first. From what I can see, this is because resizable changes the element to a position of absolute. How can I prevent this behavior Is it possible to resize the element while retaining the ability to drag the elementp  pNote also, that if you change the elements to have a position of relative add positionrelative important in the .demo style, it sort of prevents the collapsing, but the element jumps when you begin to resize or drag. Another weird behavior. Thanks for your help.p

Negative 35 pI am currently trying to implement a log for the administration section of my rails application. This will allow an admin to see what actions a user has performed and when. E.g User added a new address, User updated their postcode from X to Y.p  pAs each action could potentially involve many models, not just the user, I have made a log model which has fields for all the other system models ids, a message and a log code.p  precodeclass CreateLogs lt ActiveRecordMigration   def self.up     createtable logs do t       t.integer userid       t.integer markerid       t.integer administratorid       t.integer groupid       t.integer assignmentid       t.integer submissionid       t.integer code       t.text message        t.timestamps     end   end    def self.down     droptable logs   end end codepre  pMy concern is that for example, a user could lets say add an assignment to their account, it gets logged asp  precodeLog.createuserid gt currentuser.id, assignmentid gt theassignment.id, code gt 342, message gt  codepre  pSomewhere the code 342 corresponds to User created a new address, hence no need for messagep  pObviously in a log view, I can pull the relevant user and address info from the log idsdetails but if this user or address were to be deleted, all that information would be unavailable and so looking back through the logs, the entry would be basically useless.p  pThere has to be a better way or something already out there to help log system events like this and cope with potential deletions.p  pAlternatively I could store the entire entry as a text message but wouldnt that be really bad and fill up the database unnecessarilyp  pLet me know if any of that is unclear, just figured logging application actionsevents has to have been done beforep  pThanks,p  pPetep

Negative 35 pOk, so I have a php soap client which calls a method and obtains some information correctly, it can grab simple types like strings or even objects, but when it goes to an array of some type in this case Strings it always comes back as an empty object.  I tried casting it to array and many other things, but every option I use it always returns the same thing.p  pHere is some background informationp  pThis is a web service which I created in java using the help of eclipse.  I also autogenerated a java client to test the web service prior to creating the client in php.  I created multiple test cases which used the auto generated java client the proxy class and successfully returned the correct expected value.  Another words, java had no trouble grabbing this array of strings and showing me each value.  I did this to determine if the problem was serverside or clientside and so far its pointing more towards the clientside.p  pNext, phps soap client has a nice feature where if you set the options to include trace  1 you can call getLastResponse to see what the response xml looks like, so here it isp  precodelt xml version1.0 encodingutf8gt lt soapenvEnvelope xmlnssoapenvhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapenvelope xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstancegt     lt soapenvBodygt         lt getAllCarClassesIdsAsWsCarClassIdsResponse xmlnsXgt             lt getAllCarClassesIdsAsWsCarClassIdsReturngt                 lt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                 lt carClassIdsgt             lt getAllCarClassesIdsAsWsCarClassIdsReturngt         lt getAllCarClassesIdsAsWsCarClassIdsResponsegt     lt soapenvBodygt lt soapenvEnvelopegt codepre  pPlease note that certain values have been replaced with an X for security purposes.

Negative 35 pIve searched around here and elsewhere to for a solution to this problem, but nothing Ive tried has worked.  The googleplex abounds with samples, but many just dont seem to fit my needs or depend heavily on tricks I cant understand.p  pBasically, I am trying to create a dashboard. I gave up on .css when I couldnt get things even. I have 3 rows. The most amount of columns per row is 3, and one row will be 23 and 13, and another row will be 5050 top row is 13, 13 and 13. When I couldnt get .css to have the columns even the third 13 was shifting down, or off center from the rest of the row, I switched to .p  pWhen there was limited content in the tiles in the dashboard I was able to get the columnsrows distributed evenly using widthheight 33.3. If I resized the browser the tiles shrunk to a point where as expected if the window was minimized to much leftright only some of the tiles appeared.  Not great  I was hoping that even if the content disappeared that I could minimize leftright as far as the browser would let me and see 3 equal columns    like that.  But ok, no biggie.p  pWell, I put content in the bottom left tile 3x3 tile grid and of course it expanded.  Now I tried everything bordercollapse, whitespace, overflow hidden, etc. and still cant get it the way I want.p  pI am stumped.  I understand that at a certain point the browser is going to force things to overflow lets say arbitrarily this should happen at 800x600, but I was hoping my display would shrink appropriately tiles get smaller equally and that the scrollbars inside the tiles would show up on the yaxis overflowy so the user could scroll the text.  I even tried 800x600 minmax widthheight, but I couldnt get it to work.p  pAny advice would be appreciated.p  pThis is my html snippetp  precodeltdiv iddashboardgt     lttable cellpadding0

Negative 35 pI tolerated the security restriction that applets cannot perform arbitrary HTTP requests. p  pIt seems, however, that since a year or so ago, it isnt even possible to do an HTTP request to the URL where this applet itself is located. At least if the request is triggered by calling a method of the applet via JavaScript.p  pThis would mean nothing less than that some security guys out there at Oracle decided to let applets not even phone home any longer. Can any readers confirm this policy changep  pa hrefhttpwww.astrotexte.chappletshttpRequestor.html relnofollowOn my pagea I have a test applet which could be instrumented with JavaScript to perform an HTTP request.

Negative 35 pI am seeing an issue Java 6 on SLES11 where a UDP packet is being sent back to the client machine and codetcpdumpcode on the client machine shows it being received, but the packet isnt being seen by Java.p  pThe test works like thisp  pThe client side generates some random data, sticks it in a UDP packet, sends it to the server on a particular port and waits for it to be echoed back with a codeSOTIMEOUTcode of 180000 ms.  When it receives it back it prints out that it has received it and how long since its been sent.p  pThe server side listens for a UDP packet on a that port.  When it receives it, it delays a bit then sends it right back, unchanged.  The delay starts at some initial value 3000 ms then doubles each time it receives a packet until it reaches a maximum 90000 ms after which the delay just stays at the maximum.p  pIt works fine until the delay hits 48000 ms.  The codetcpdumpcode running on the client shows the packet being sent and shows the reply packet arriving 48000 ms later.  However, the Java program never sees that reply packet and after 180000 ms claims the receive timed out.  Even though the client machine got the packet after only 48000 ms as codetcpdumpcode shows.p  pWhat could be happeningp  pBelow is the output of the programs and codetcpdumpcode and after that is the source of the client and server programs.p  pOn the strongclientstrong machine the test program output isp  precoderichova3UDPTest2  java cp .

Negative 35 pI am using a stdmap as data holder for my algorithm but for some reason, I need to control the access of map element in some way. We know that one can access the element of the map by calling operator[key] directly. However, if the key doesnt not exist and whenever you call operator[key] it will create that key with the value initialized as ZERO automatically. But in my algorithm, I will control the access by limiting that one can only modify the element when the exist key and when the value is nonzero. For example, if the map has the following elements 3, 2, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2, 7, one can only modify 3,2 and 2,7. I know that I can add some code with mapfindkey or mapcountkey anywhere before I modify the element, but it is too many so I would like to write my own container as followsp  precodeclass MyContainer  template lttypename Tgt class myiterator public iteratorltforwarditeratortag, Tgt    friend class MyContainer   private     T pointer     myiteratorT pointerpointerpointer     public     Tamp operator return pointer      const myiteratorltTgtamp operator            pointergtcurrentiterator   return this           bool operatorconst myiteratorltTgtamp other const            return pointergtcurrentiterator  other.pointergtcurrentiterator           bool isEndvoid const            return pointergtcurrentiterator  pointergtenditerator            class MyContainer        friend class myiteratorltMyContainergt     public       typedef myiteratorltMyContainergt iterator      private       mapltint, intgt data       mapltint, intgtiterator currentiterator, enditerator      public       MyContainer currentiterator  data.begin         void addDataPairint key, int value data[key]  value        int first return currentiterator.first       int second return currentiterator.second         initialize the currentiterator to the begin of the data map and set the end iterator too       iterator begin                 currentiterator  data.begin         enditerator  data.end         return myiteratorltMyContainergtthis                return the container w currentiterator point to where the key is       MyContainer ampoperator[]int key                currentiterator  data.findkey         return this                only increase the value by one when the key does exist and with initial value nonzero       void operatorvoid                if  currentiterator  data.end ampamp             currentiterator.secondgt0                      currentiterator.second                     codepre  pAs you can see, instead of using mapiterator, I inherit one from stditerator such that, the iterator refer to the MyContainer itself instead of the value type of the map. I can visit all element by p  precodeMyContainer h  h.addDataPair1, 3 h.addDataPair2, 4 h.addDataPair3, 0 h.addDataPair7, 9 h.addDataPair11, 2  for MyContaineriterator ith.begin it.isEnd it    cout ltlt it.first ltlt   ltlt it.second ltlt endl  codepre  pWith this idea, whenever the iterator was looped, it will return a referent the the container so I can add some code like operator[], operator to control the behavior of updating the map element. For example, in this code,           p  precodevoid operatorvoid codepre  pwill ignore any operation on nonexist key or on the element with value initialized as zero. However, there are still some doubts in the code which I am looking for your suggestionsp  p1 if you read the code carefully, you will see that I use currentiterator to store the current mapiterator and use enditerator to store the end iterator for the map. Those iterators will be set when MyContainer.begin was called. The reason I need enditerator is that if instead I set the currentiterator as map.end then, it will change the currentiterator during the loop. For example, the following code wont workp  precodeiterator begin     currentiterator  data.begin   return myiteratorltMyContainergtthis   iterator end     currentiterator  data.end    here we set currentiterator as data.end, but this will change the current iterator of data too   return myiteratorltMyContainergtthis  codepre  pso when you loop the container with the following code, it wont run correctlyp  precodefor MyContaineriterator ith.begin ith.end it    cout ltlt it.first ltlt   ltlt it.second ltlt endl  codepre  pthats why I write a isEnd function in the iterator instead. But this doesnt look elegant, any better idea to get around thisp  p2 for the limited  operation, if we modify the map element from the container as follows, it goes without any problemp  precode assuming the map initially contains 2, 4, 3, 0, 7, 9, 11, 2  h[4]  modify the element with key4, wont do anything, no such key h[3]  modify the element with key3, wont do anything, value0 h[11]  modify the element with key11, then we have 11, 3 h.begin  modify the first element, works, we have 2,5 codepre  pBut if you modify that while iterating all elements, the loop will never end, whys thatp  precodefor MyContaineriterator ith.begin it.isEnd it    it     it works   it[3]  it will cause the loop run and never stop   cout ltlt it.first ltlt   ltlt it.second ltlt endl  codepre  pAny idea p

The issues becomes that the file that is exported is very small, often under 100kb. It seems that the file is sitting in the File Caching system, because after writing the file, I cannot eject the USB drive by code or by the tool in the system tray provided by windows. It says the device is still busy.p  pIs there a way I can force flush the cache, or another method to get around this issue My IsReady method seems to more check that the device is available to be accessed, not necessarily ready to be ejected.p  pThanksp
Negative 35 pCurrently have an ASP.NET Web Application that I plan to convert to Azure.   One Application per customer with one SQL DataBase and Membership Services for authentication and authorization.   Have a role for user admin and a page where the customer can administer their own userIDs and passwords. p  pIn the upgrade to Azure I plan to offer both a web client and a WPF client.  The WPF client will connect to web service over WCF.p  pWhat is an appropriate security modelp  pNot sure if ACS is the right tool.  The application must directly provide userID and password authentication with roles and manage that data.   A customer admin role must be able to reset a password so an external identity provider does not fit.  At the ASP.NET level membership services is doing exactly what I need.   I want to extent that model to a WPF client over WCF.p  pClient is very very chatty.  Have a WPF client version today that connect directly to SQL for a limited number of trusted high volume customers.

Negative 35 pI am porting a static library project composed entirely of C files to iOS and when I try to use the library in an application I get a bunch of undefined symbols.p  pThe problem appears to be name decoration.

The prototype is in a header file that is included by both file2.c and file3.c. Are the strongZ10strong and strongiistrong C name decorations If so, why are these C files being compiled as Cp  pEDITp  pCodos question in regard to the Compile Sources As setting led me to try changing it to C from According to File Type. This forced all files to be compiled as C and resolved the function name mangling problem but I still had 42 undefined symbols which almost all turned out to be variables. I noticed that there were no initializers for these variables so I added an initializer to one of them and when I rebuilt the project that uses the library, I only had 3 undefined symbols. It appears that adding just one initializer to a variable enabled the linker to resolve all references to that modules variables. The 3 remaining undefined symbols appear to be yet another problems.p  pEDIT2p  pOf the 3 remaining errors, 1 was an uninitialized variable from another module and 2 were inlined functions that needed to be declared static.p

Its not that I WANT to this particular tool to show the .pdf files its more a management requirement than any other thing.

Negative 35 pI have a commandLink which has a rendered which is calculated based on values in a RequestScoped bean.  The commandLink uses fajax to call a listener but it appears that the method is never executed. p  pIt turns out if I set renderedtrue or no rendered attribute at all, the listener is executed properly. Is it possible that because the rendered is based on request scoped values which no longer exist at the time of the ajax postback and hence result in a false, that the listener is being skipped Note that the fajax also performs a few execute actions which are performed successfully.p

Negative 35 pI have a .NET 4.5 WCF client app that uses the asyncawait pattern to make volumes of calls. My development machine is dualproc with 8gb RAM production will be 5 CPU with 8gb RAM at Amazon AWS . The remote WCF service called by my code uses out and ref parameters on a web method that I need. My code instances a proxy client each time, writes any results to a public ConcurrentDictionary, and then returns null.p  pI ran Perfmon, watching the thread count on the system, and it goes between 2830. It takes hours for my client to complete the volumes of calls that are made. Yes, hours. The remote service is backed by a big company, they have many servers to receive my WCF calls, so the more calls I can throw at them, the better.p  pI think that things are actually still happening synchronously, even though the method that makes the WCF call is decorated with async because the proxy method cannot have await. Is that true p  pMy code looks like thisp  precode   async private void CallMe          Console.WriteLine DateTime.Now      var workTasks  this.AnotherConcurrentDict.Select oneB gt GetData etcetcetc .CastltTaskgt.ToList     await Task.WhenAll workTasks             private async TaskltWorkingBitsgt GetDataetcetcetc          var commClient  new RemoteClient     var cpResponse  new GetPackage     var responseInfo  commClient.GetData name, password , ref cpResponse.aproperty, filterid , out cpResponse.Identifiers     foreach var onething in cpResponse.Identifiers                add to the ConcurrentDictionary          return null  I already wrote to the ConcurrentDictionary so no need to return anything codepre  presponseInfo is not awaitable beacuse the WCF call has ref and out parameters.p  pI was thinking that way to speed this up is not to put asyncawait in this method, but instead create a wrapper method where I can make things awaitasync, but I am not that is the smartestsafest way to work it. p  pWhat is a smart way to get more outbound calls to the service expand IO completion thread pool, trick calls into running in the background so Task.WhenAll can complete quickerp  pThanks for all ideassamplespointers. I am hitting a bottleneck somewhere.p

Negative 35 pIn my MVC4 app, there are some actions that need to behave differently depending on whether you are logged in FormsAuthentication in my case or not.p  pFor example, I have an AccountController that has a method RenderAccountAndProfile. If logged out, the corresponding partial view displays a log in prompt and button. If a user is logged in, the users profile links appear, alongside a log out button.p  pThe approach Ive taken thus far in projects is to simply have an if statement along the lines...p  precode        if HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated                      ...                  else                      ...          codepre  pHowever, Ive just created what I think is a reasonably elegant alternative to this approach.p  pI have created a new attribute called AnonymousUsersOnly, which is very simplep  precodepublic class AnonymousUsersOnlyAttribute  System.Web.Mvc.ActionMethodSelectorAttribute      public override bool IsValidForRequestSystem.Web.Mvc.ControllerContext controllerContext, System.Reflection.MethodInfo methodInfo              return controllerContext.HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated       codepre  pMy AccountController class is decorated with the Authorize attribute. This then enabled me to have the following codep  precode[Authorize] public class AccountController  Controller      [AllowAnonymous]     [AnonymousUsersOnly]     [ActionNameRenderAccountAndProfile]     public ActionResult RenderAccountAndProfileAnonymous               create a logged out view model         return ContentNOT LOGGED IN  LOG IN HERE           [ActionNameRenderAccountAndProfile]     public ActionResult RenderAccountAndProfileAuthorized               create a logged in view model         return ContentLOGGED IN  LOG OUT       codepre  pI quite like this approach because my action methods conform to the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSingleresponsibilityprinciple relnofollowSingle Responsibility Principlea. Each method now only deals with either a logged in situation or a logged out situation. I dont need any if statements directing the traffic any more.p  pThis ought to make Unit Testing easier too, since each method is now only concerned with one outcome, not two. We can write unit tests to test each outcome separately, calling different methods.p  pClearly, I cant have two methods with the same signature so thats why I have to use the ActionName attribute.p  pI would appreciate your critique here. Do you think this is an elegant solution or not What are the pros and cons to this approach And what security implicationsrisks could there be with thisp

Basically it would update a database and then send a message back to the user. My questions are how do I obtain a SMS Short code number How do I link that with a server What programming language is the most efficient and effective for accomplishing the task I have a little bit of programming experience in HTML, JavaScript, PHP and C and am willing to learn more languages if required.

Negative 35 pI have a CGPath which Im trying to rotate, scale and translate. I also have a resizable UIView which acts as a helper for the user to allow himher apply the transformation, so whenever this views frame changes the new transformation is applied to the selected CGPath. Also, I set the transform anchor point to the topleft corner. It scales and rotates just fine. However, if I set a rotation different than 0 and then scale, the anchor point is not at the topleft corner anymore. It seems like it is changed during the rotation, so lets say we start with 0 rotation and go all the way round to 360, then the anchor point is set back to the topleft corner as I would expect.p  pHeres the code Im using to create the transformp  precodeCGPoint anchorPointInPixels  CGPointMakeself.boundingBox.origin.x, self.boundingBox.origin.y  CGAffineTransform t  CGAffineTransformIdentity t  CGAffineTransformTranslatet, self.translation.x  anchorPointInPixels.x, self.translation.y  anchorPointInPixels.y t  CGAffineTransformRotatet, self.rotation t  CGAffineTransformScalet, self.scale.x, self.scale.y t  CGAffineTransformTranslatet, anchorPointInPixels.x, anchorPointInPixels.y self.transform  t codepre  pLet me explain that piece of code a bit 1. Paths points are in absolute coordinates 2. The bounding box is calculated just once and it is set as the rectangle enclosing all the points within the path. The bounding box is also in absolute coordinates 3. Translation specifies an offset from the bounding boxs origin, so when the path has been created, translation equals to 0 and it remains like that until user moves itp  pSo, how to make it rotate, without affecting the anchor pointp  pThanks for readingp  pMarianop

Negative 35 pI finally got into a problem that I cant find a solution here. Im using a Lua Wrapper Class found in here a hrefhttpluausers.orgwikiCppConvenientLuaWrapperClass relnofollowhttpluausers.orgwikiCppConvenientLuaWrapperClassa. Weve been able to expose a complete API plus more other funcionalities like serial communication and on. p  pThe concept behind this Lua Wrapper is that you expose every method before compiling so when youre running your programm all methods will be added to the Lua Stack and in that way you can execute them. The idea now is to build kind of a Dll in order to complete this process of exposing methods. This way you wont needed to release a version with all exposed methods instead you load them trough multiple dll files.p  pIve tried to create another table and register other methods in that table, but with that, previous exposed methods stop working.p  pThe other way around I can think of, is to create a dll but in C that contains all desirable methods and load it directly to Lua. But I think the other way would be better.p  pHave you been able to do something similar  Am I having some wrong conceptp  pThanksp  pHumm... I really dont want to change our wrapper at this time. I think I could manage to do it, sort of. Instead of adding a new table for the plugin functions, Ive added a new subtable tha will contain the functions names and cClosures to be called from Lua. So at the end we should havep  precodeapplication.functionName application.plugin.functionName codepre  pEven if it work this way it will do fine. Now I wonder how can we reference the luasettable when exposing the functions to be added to application[plugin][pluginFunction] instead of aplication[pluginFunction] This is how the normal functions are exposedp  precodemState is a pointer to a LuaState luapushstring mState, functionName   methodDesc is a pointer to an object that describes the function argumentsreturns  luapushlightuserdata mState, methodDesc   exposeMethodProxy is the method that is responsible for conneting lua ccalls to the cfunctions luapushcclosure mState, exposedMethodProxy, 1   mMethodTableIndex is a member variable that contains the index of the table tha hold all exposed functions luasettable mState, mMethodTableIndex  codepre  pAny ideas on how I could achieve adding the cclosures not to the main tableat mMethodTableIndex as mainTable[functionName] but at maintable[plugin][functionNane].p

In addition, they want to be able to modify the open data, and the changes to open data from the secure site need to be propagated to the open site and conflicts need to be handled accordingly.p  pI am hoping for a databaseonly solution since we have reports tied to stored procedures that will now need to show secure and open data for secure users.p  pWe can assume the data is marked accordingly as secure YN.p  pThe current path were on seems less than desirable.

Negative 35 pIm trying to add an AfterBuild task to my VC2012 project that only gets executed if the output changes. If Im correct, in C when youre adding a postbuildevent, you have the option to specify when to run the postbuildevent.

The only property I found is strongLinkSkippedExecutionstrong but Im not sure its the best option.p  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 35 pI have gone through Quickstart with Google Drive and I have also used Google Play Services. The docs for Google Drive outline the process of how the authorization flow works. The docs also indicate that developers should not use Drive initiated authorization although it appears that the Quickstart sample app does exactly that. I am left with the impression that Google prefers that the developer handle all the details of authorization.p  pYet after trying out sample code that uses Google Play Services but not for Google Drive, I am left with the impression that Google wants developers to use Google Play Services to handle all the authorization. It seems that Google Play Services simplify the authorization process significantly. Although the docs dont say this, I found elsewhere online that GoogleAuthUtil.getToken manages how access and refresh tokens are retrieved, especially after they expire.p  pBasically, the issue I am struggling with to understand is whether the Google Drive docs for the API are out of date and Google wants us to rely upon Google Play Services. There seems to be a lot of complexity in the Google Drive authorization process that Google Play Services has eliminated.

Negative 35 pIve got a .dll library Im writing that interfaces with a proprietary COM assembly.  My goal is to publish my work online once its built, however I need to remove the COM assembly as a project reference to avoid distribution of this proprietary dll.  So what Im trying to be able to do is dynamically load the assembly at runtime, and invoke methods where I need them.  Traditionally Ive used object reflection for unknown types, however this can get slow at times, and involves several ugly instanciations.  In .NET 4.0 is there a way to cleanly get all the methods and toss them into a dynamic classinterface at runtime p  pIm currently getting the object like thisp  precodeType myClassType  Type.GetTypeFromProgIDMyClass.Myclass.1 object classObj  Activator.CreateInstancemyClassType codepre  pI thought Id be able to use Type.GetMethods, however it only returns the generic ones Equals, ToString, GetLifetime..., etc..  I know the class uses an interface, so I tried looking into dynamically loading the interface also.  That led me to Reflection.Emit, and the Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk, which I am failing to understand so far.p  pIf theres a way for me to invoke methods without needing to throw a bunch of BindingFlags every few lines, Id greatly appreciate a nudge in the right directionp  pI do have the GUID for both the Class and the Interface if that helps at all.p

Negative 35 pWhen the kernel is executing a contextswitch, i.e. when it is in that function, is it possible that some other task makes a system call As far as I understand, as the processor state is being swapped, no other code can actually execute until the contextswitch completes.

I have 2 versions of the syscall vector, with one of them containing addresses of modified sys call code. When a process of interest is scheduled in, I will update the syscalltable pointer to point to the new one. and then swap it out when the process of interest is swapped out.p  pIm new to kernel dev, so feedback on my approach is also welcome.  PS I know about ptrace and it doesnt suit my needs. Too many context switches involved in virtualizing syscalls UML style.p

Negative 35 pOkay so I am very new to Django and relatively new to Python as well.

Negative 35 pIm currently working with upgrading and restructuring an OpenGL render engine. The engine is used for visualising large scenes of architectural data buildings with interior, and the amount of objects can become rather large. As is the case with any building, there is a lot of occluded objects within walls, and you naturally only see the objects that are in the same room as you, or the exterior if you are on the outside. This leaves a large number of objects that should be occluded through occlusion culling and frustum culling.p  pAt the same time there is a lot of repetative geometry that can be batched in renderbatches, and also a lot of objects that can be rendered with instanced rendering.p  pThe way I see it, it can be difficult to combine renderbatching and culling in an optimal fashion. If you batch too many objects in the same VBO its difficult to cull the objects on the CPU in order to skip rendering that batch. At the same time if you skip the culling on the cpu, a lot of objects will be processed by the GPU while they are not visible. If you skip batching copletely in order to more easily cull on the CPU, there will be an unwanted high amount of render calls.p  pI have done some research into existing techniques and theories as to how these problems are solved in modern graphics, but I have not been able to find any concrete solution. An idea a colleague and me came up with was restricting batches to objects relatively close to eachother e.g all chairs in a room or within a radius of n meeters. This could be simplified and optimized through use of octtrees.p  pDoes anyone have any pointers to techniques used for scene managment, culling, batching etc in state of the art modern graphics engines p

Negative 35 pI really enjoy using Chromes URL bar because it remembers commonlyvisited sites and often suggests a good completion based on what Ive typed andor visited before. So, for example, I can type codetcode in the URL bar and Chrome will automatically fill it in with codetwitter.comcode, or I can type codemapscode and Chrome will fill in the code.google.comcode. This gives me the convenience of datadriven domain name shortcuts without having to maintain an explicit list.p  pWhat Im wondering, though, is how Chrome determines that an old shortcut should be replaced with a new one. For example, if I visit codetwitter.comcode often, then that becomes the completion when I type codetcode. But if I then start visiting codetwilio.comcode often enough, then, after some time, Chrome will start to fill that in as the default completion for codetcode. What I cant figure out is how or when that transition takes place. It also seems that there are at least two cases involved  one for domain names, and another for path strings, because if I visit a certain full URL often, and then want to get to the root of the same domain, I end up having to type the entire domain name out to get Chrome to ignore the fullURL completion.p  pIf I had to guess, Id imagine that Chrome stores the things that I type in the URL bar in a trie whose values are the number of times that a particular string has been typed andor visited . Then Id imagine it has some sort of exponential decay model for the counts in the trie. But this is just a guess. Does anyone know how this updating process happens p

Both of them are connected to the same network and are able to ping each other. p  precodepublic class ServerActivity extends Activity   private TextView serverStatus private Button Start private Button Mark private Button Stop  DEFAULT IP public static String SERVERIP  10.0.2.15   DESIGNATE A PORT public static final int SERVERPORT  6000  private Handler handler  new Handler  private ServerSocket serverSocket  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain     serverStatus  TextView findViewByIdR.id.serverstatus      Start  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.start     Mark  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.mark     Stop  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.stop       SERVERIP  getLocalIpAddress      Thread fst  new Threadnew ServerThread     fst.start     public class ServerThread implements Runnable       public void run          try              if SERVERIP  null                  handler.postnew Runnable                      Override                     public void run                          serverStatus.setTextListening on IP   SERVERIP   SERVERPORT                                                       serverSocket  new ServerSocketSERVERPORT                 while true                       LISTEN FOR INCOMING CLIENTS                     final Socket client  serverSocket.accept                     handler.postnew Runnable                          Override                         public void run                              serverStatus.setTextConnected.                                                                    try                                  handler.postnew Runnable                                  Override                                 public void run                                       DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO THE FRONT END                                      THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN BE CREATIVE                                       Log.dServerActivity, S Sending command.

Now, I know that Xamarin.iOS is fairly unreliable where breakpoints are concerned but even putting in trace methods yields no joy. I even replaced the CreatePresenter method with a method that throws an exception and the app didnt crash.p  pOther modifications to my application show up when I deploy them, so this isnt some sort of caching problem, although I have cleaned both the sources on my PC and on my Mac as well.

Negative 35 pI have seen various workaround for animating ngview forward and backward when a button is tappedclicked on for Angular 1.2. This involves having a method on your scope that will set a  scope variable to a pageanimation that is used in ngclass to set a class on the element that has ngview directive on it. On a larger app, this doesnt seem very scalable. Part of it I believe would be that youd create a servicefactory to inject into the controller to not duplicate code. But Im really wondering if theres something you can do in the router resolve  functionality where you set some values for animation there and send them to a service that returns a promise that is immediately resolved. This could set the class on the ngview element before the route changes and possibly manage it this way. p  pDoes anyone have a more defined way to handle animating ngview in forward and reverse depending on what route the user is going top

Negative 35 pI have been stuck on this for over a week and I think I am long overdue for asking on here..  I am trying to get my users to upload their video files using the jQuery File Upload Plugin.  We do not want to save the file on our server.  The final result is having the file saved in our Backlot using the Ooyala API.  I have tried various approaches and I am successful in creating the asset in Backlot and getting my upload URLs, but I do not know how to upload the file chunks using the URLs into Backlot.  I have tried FileReader, FormData, etc.  I am pasting the last code I had that created the asset, and gave me the upload URLs, but did not save any chunks into Backlot.  I assume I may be getting stuck in one of my AJAX calls, but I am not very sure.  p  pI keep getting strongUncaught InvalidStateError An attempt was made to use an object that is not, or is no longer, usable.strong p  pHere is my page with the JS for the jQuery File Upload widget by BlueImpp  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltscript srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.9.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcltphp print basepath . pathtotheme gtresjsjQueryFileUploadjsvendorjquery.ui.widget.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcltphp print basepath . pathtotheme gtresjsjQueryFileUploadjsjquery.iframetransport.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcltphp print basepath . pathtotheme gtresjsjQueryFileUploadjsjquery.fileupload.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt         ltinput idfileupload typefile acceptvideogt                 ltscriptgt                             var reader  FileReader                             var blob                             fileupload.fileupload                                 forceIframeTransport true,                                 maxChunkSize 500000,                                 type POST,                                 add function e, data                                      var goUpload  true                                     var ext  [avi,flv,mkv,mov,mp4,mpg,ogm,ogv,rm,wma,wmv]                                     var uploadFile  data.files[0]                                     var fileName  uploadFile.name                                     var fileExtension  fileName.substringfileName.lastIndexOf.  1                                      if .inArray fileExtension, ext   1                                          alertYou must upload a video file only                                         goUpload  false                                                                          if goUpload  true                                            .post..sitesallthemesepiscopalparseUploadJSON.php, json  JSON.stringifydata.files[0], function result                                              var returnJSON  .parseJSONresult                                             data.filechunk  data.files[0].slice0, 500000                                             data.url  returnJSON[0]                                             reader.onloadend  functione                                                  if e.target.readyState  FileReader.DONE   DONE  2                                                     data.url  returnJSON[0]                                                                                                                                              .eachreturnJSON, functioni, item                                                  data.url  returnJSON[0]                                                 blob  data.files[0].slice0, 500000                                                 console.logblob                                                 reader.readAsArrayBufferblob                                                 data.submit                                                                                           data.submit                                                                                                                                                        ,end add                                  submit function e, data                                      console.logdata Seems fine                                     console.log.active                                     .post..sitesallthemesepiscopalcurlTransfer.php, data, function result  fails                                          console.logresult                                                                           return false                                                                                             ltscriptgt  ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre  pThen there is the parseUploadJSON.php code, please keep in mind that my real code has the right Backlot keys.

Negative 35 pI have a really weird error,p  pso Im trying to read a pgm image by loading its pixel values into an array, I was able to correctly read in its version, height, width, and maximum possible pixel value. However, when I start reading the pixel values, I always get 0. I know its not zero because I can read it using imread in matlab, but have to implement it in c, plus I couldnt use the opencv library so..p  pAnd besides, when I read the pgm file in like NotePad, the first few lines are good representing the information about this image ,how ever, the actual pixel values are not readable. Im wondering if I need some sort of parsing to read a pgm image Its version is p5.p  pThanksp

What i am doing is just add different object and then view that objects give option to delete and edit already created entities. When I click on the delete link against any entity in the view page. i just delete it. Issue is with me that after deleting that entity i redirect the user again to the view page so that user can see entity has been deleted. But when i see the view page again view page also show the deleted entity. means entity has not been deleted. If i refresh the page 3,4 times then after that entity didnt show. This is because entity has been deleted at first place but it take some time to complete this process. I want to know why i am facing this behavior of GAE If GAE or JDO is slow in performing CRUD operations. I am sharing my code for deletion of entity and for view all entities.

Negative 35 pI have a really large zip file approx 3GB that I would like to download onto the users device, but I also need to unzip it. p  pThe problem is that in reality I need double this space free on local storage, so that the zip file can first be downloaded and then for it to be unzipped accordingly. This means that for the entire process to be successful the user would need at least 6GB of free space.

Because these computations often take some time, I would like the user to be able to pauseresume or stop the computations at any time.

However, I stupidly forgot to check in what version DateTime came into existence, and it turns out it was introduced in PHP 5.2.p  pI could spend an hour or so rewriting the code to not use DateTime, but Id have difficulty doing so without functions to add time intervals.p  pIs there any strong alternative to DateTime, such as something that is existed before it was introduced in PHP 5.2 Alternatively, is it possible to get the DateTime class from another source and include it in my scriptp

Negative 35 pIve been trouble shooting for the past several hours and have finally found the cause of the problem. I have recently added an upload script to my website. When the script runs it uploads files from website to another serverp  precode echo shellexecperl homeprogramupload.sh codepre  pThat isnt however the problem. That works fine. The problem is that if anyone is using the script then the webpage wouldt load at all.p  pThe cause of the problem is thisp  precode sessionstart   sec  filegetcontentshomeprogramapikey.txt   if SESSION[name]  sec codepre  pThat is the first few lines of code for every single page of website which checks the password entered when the session was created with the actual password. If I remove this from my home page index.php then the site loads fine. So it seems that something to do with session doesnt load until the upload script is finished which I find really bizarre hence why it took so long to isolate the problem.p
Negative 35 pSo were using JSLogger.com with much success on individual pages.  But we have a wizardtype site with about 12 steps in it that all runs on index.asp which is just the CSS and empty container.  It is using jQuery to load each next step progressively as they go through the wizard.  p  pMy question is about JS errors  specifically how we can trap for an log errors occurring within the AJAX pages that are loaded from the server inside the div on index.asp, since index.asp is not actually refreshing ever.  We are using codejQuery.loadcode by the way with a POST to fetch the next page.p  pAt this time JSLogger.com only records the error on index.asp so we truly have no idea which inner step of the wizard the error is generated on.  Furthermore, it [JSLogger] gives a hugely bogus line number since the error is bubbling up so to speak from the ajax content in the div to the main DOM at index.asp.  p  pWhich in all means the JSLogger is not working at all for us shy of letting us know something is wrong but we have no idea where or on which page.p  pIf you have suggestions for alternate JS loggers that work better with AJAX content Im all ears.p  pHere is very loosely how our code is laid out...p  h3index.asph3  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjslogger.comjslogger.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgtwindow.jslogger  new JSLoggerltscriptgt ltscript srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.10.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idcontentgtltdivgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt content.loadajaxcontent.html ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  h3ajaxcontent.htmlh3  precodelthtmlgt ltbodygt I am some content. ltscript typetextjavascriptgt var a  document.getElementByIdfoo     not present in the DOM var b  a.trim.value                   will error ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pBy this layout index.asp contains an empty div which is loaded with jQuery.

Negative 35 pFor the longest time I thought asynchronous was synonymous to running something on a background thread, while synchronous meant on the main thread blocking UI updates and interactions. I understand that not running on the main thread for expensive actions is because it doesnt allow UI actions to occur as the main thread is occupied, but why is synchronous troublesomep  pHowever, its since came to my attention that you can make asynchronous calls on the main thread, and synchronous calls on background threads.p  pI always hear people saying not to use expensive calls synchronously or on the main thread, as it will block the UI for the user. Are these two separate issues I should be making sure I dont do What are the differencesp
Negative 35 pIm developing a UI using PyQt where a single item in my Qcombobox can have two or three words separated by commas. So for eg item 1 can be emText1, Text2, Text3em and item 2 will be emText4, Text5em.p  pWhat I want to do is give multiple background colors to the items separated by the , in the itemText. So, in case of item 1 emText1, Text2, Text3em I would need a color behind emText1em, a different one behind emText2em and a third one behind emText3em. Similarly, item 2 would have 2 background colors.p  pI was thinking of using rtf format, but could not figure out a way to give multiple colors to one item row.p  pThank you for the help.p

I followed the tutorial to get to this point a hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsmvc4gettingstartedwithaspnetmvc4addingamodel relnofollowhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsmvc4gettingstartedwithaspnetmvc4addingamodelap  pI have 3 classes FleetModel, ShipModel and SailorModel. FleetModel has a List Ships, ShipModel in turn has a List Sailors. And just to make things more interesting SailorModel has an array of strings string[] Operations.p  pWhen I create a new FleetModel object, I can see that new tables are created in the Fleet.mdf, with reference IDs, etc. But when I return one such object, only information from the top level  FleetModel is returned.p  pI found out that I could use .Include to include duh the first sublevel like thisp  precodeFleetModel output  db.Fleet.Includex gt x.Ships.FirstOrDefaultx gt x.Id  id codepre  pBut I dont understand the whole construct good enough to include the lower level objectsmodels.

This is a simple   way to invoke barcode scanning and receive the result, without any need to integrate, modify, or learn the   projects source code.ltpgt     lth2gtInitiating a barcode scanlth2gt     ltpgtTo integrate, create an instance of code IntentIntegrator and call link initiateScan and wait   for the result in your app.ltpgt     ltpgtIt does require that the Barcode Scanner or workalike application is installed. The   link initiateScan method will prompt the user to download the application, if needed.ltpgt     ltpgtThere are a few steps to using this integration. First, your link Activity must implement   the method link ActivityonActivityResultint, int, Intent and include a line of code like thisltpgt     ltpregtcode   public void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent      IntentResult scanResult  IntentIntegrator.parseActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, intent     if scanResult  null         handle scan result           else continue with any other code you need in the method     ...      ltpregt     ltpgtThis is where you will handle a scan result.ltpgt     ltpgtSecond, just call this in response to a user action somewhere to begin the scan processltpgt     ltpregtcode   IntentIntegrator integrator  new IntentIntegratoryourActivity   integrator.initiateScan   ltpregt     ltpgtNote that link initiateScan returns an link AlertDialog which is nonnull if the   user was prompted to download the application. This lets the calling app potentially manage the dialog.   In particular, ideally, the app dismisses the dialog if its still active in its link ActivityonPause   method.ltpgt     ltpgtYou can use link setTitleString to customize the title of this download prompt dialog or, use   link setTitleByIDint to set the title by string resource ID. Likewise, the prompt message, and   yesno button labels can be changed.ltpgt     ltpgtFinally, you can use link addExtraString, Object to add more parameters to the Intent used   to invoke the scanner. This can be used to set additional options not directly exposed by this   simplified API.ltpgt     ltpgtBy default, this will only allow applications that are known to respond to this intent correctly   do so. The apps that are allowed to response can be set with link setTargetApplicationsList.   For example, set to link TARGETBARCODESCANNERONLY to only target the Barcode Scanner app itself.ltpgt     lth2gtSharing text via barcodelth2gt     ltpgtTo share text, encoded as a QR Code onscreen, similarly, see link shareTextCharSequence.ltpgt     ltpgtSome code, particularly download integration, was contributed from the Anobiit application.ltpgt     lth2gtEnabling experimental barcode formatslth2gt     ltpgtSome formats are not enabled by default even when scanning with link ALLCODETYPES, such as   PDF417. Use link initiateScanjava.util.Collection with   a collection containing the names of formats to scan for explicitly, like PDF417, to use such   formats.ltpgt     author Sean Owen   author Fred Lin   author Isaac PotocznyJones   author Brad Drehmer   author gcstang   public class IntentIntegrator         public static final int REQUESTCODE  0x0000c0de  Only use bottom 16 bits       private static final String TAG  IntentIntegrator.class.getSimpleName        public static final String DEFAULTTITLE  Install Barcode Scanner       public static final String DEFAULTMESSAGE            This application requires Barcode Scanner.

Why is thatp  pMy theory is that by having a constant only on a header file, the file Constants.h is copypasted into the class files that import it, consequently I end up with two copies of kTestConstant. However, by using an implementation file, that file is compiled and linked with the classes that import Constants.h. Is this more or less correctp

Negative 35 pIm am in the middle of creating my first, substantial .NET MVC application.

For a number of features I need to select data from up to 5 tables and send it back to the view, and I am not quite sure how to go about it since view takes either Models or View Modelsp  pI understand the concept of View Models quite well, but is creating one every time I need to send data from multiple tables the only solution to this And if so could anyone tell me the best practices when doing itp  pThanks in advance for any help p

Negative 35 pIts trivial to make hyperlinks clickable in a codeUITextViewcode. You just set the detect links checkbox on the view in IB, and it detects http links and turns them into hyperlinks. p  pHowever, that still means that what the user sees is the raw link. RTF files and HTML both allow you to set up a userreadable string with a link behind it. p  pIts easy to install attributed text into a text view or a codeUILabelcode or codeUITextFieldcode, for that matter. However, if that attributed text includes a link, the link is not clickable.p  pIs there a way to make userreadable text clickable in a codeUITextViewcode, codeUILabelcode, or codeUITextFieldcodep  pThe markup is different on SO, but here is the general idea.

Negative 35 pThere is a similar question already asked but none provided the right answer so I will go a bit more in depth to make sure we understand. PHP sessions store a serverside session ID that will be compared to that which is saved in the cookie on the client side but CodeIgniter does not seem to store the session ID server side, if so, how does it know the cookie grabbed from the client is valid and has not been tampered withp  pI looked through CodeIgniters functions in the session library and it does not seem to store the session ID anywhere, couldnt I just create my own cookie to resemble CodeIgniters and go through the pages security All answers appreciated good day to everybody.p

Negative 35 pwhat would be the best way to have a website that is hosted on two distinct IIS servers which are loadbalanced using Microsofts NLB to sync the files that could be uploaded from the websites usersp  pExample Site on server A is the one User A is visiting. User A goes to a page that allows him to uplad an image to the web site, which will then be displayed. Now, User B goes to the same site and access the page where images are displayed but hes load balanced to Server B. User B doesnt see the image uploaded by User A because no file has been uploaded to server B. Right now, were using Robocopy but I find this solution not very practical as we need the files to be available very fast without having to rely on a scripted tool that a might fail for lots of reasons, b storage containing twice the files isnt very acceptable since a lot of space will be needed and we do not want to have to buy storage units twice for one file version, it just doesnt make sense.p  pSo, what are your suggestions, community p

Negative 35 pI am programming a Wifi Direct game, but have run into a problem with the WifiP2pDevice Status when one user declines the invitation to join the connection.p  ol liPhone A initiates connection to Phone B li liPhone B status becomes INVITED as displayed on Phone Ali liPhone B decline invitation from Phone Ali liPhone B status is still INVITED as displayed on Phone Ali ol  pShouldnt the status be shifted back to AVAILABLE as displayed on Phone A I have refreshed the list of Available devices, but the status remains unchanged. even if I restart the app, it still shows the status of Phone B as invitedp  pIs this supposed to happen based on the API of WifiDirect or am I missing somethingp  pstrongEdit More Informationstrongp  pIn the BroadcastReciever, when the intent is WifiP2pManager.WIFIP2PPEERSCHANGEDACTION, then the manager requests the peers using a Fragment that implements a PeerListListener, which just prints a list of available devices and information including status of those devices. So when Phone A sends an invitation with manager.connect it changes the status to INVITED. But if Phone B declines, the status remains as INVITED. And those statuses are triggered on a notifyDataSetChanged. It is not so much a question about code, but how wifi direct determines and changes statuses of the devices. But I can provide code if needed.p
Negative 35 pI am trying to make a fixed navigation that lets you scroll between elements on a page and keeps count of where you are on the page. I have seen a couple examples, to which I modified slightly, but havent been able to get any to work properly. My latest attempt works fine with when you toggle between the previousnext buttons to get from section to section, but I want to take into account where the user is on the page. For example, if I click on the next button two times, the count is set to 2, and it takes me to the second section on the page. Then if I click the previous button once, the count is set to 1, and it takes me the first section on the page. Now if I scroll down towards the middle of the page using the browser scrollbar, and hit the next button, the count is set to 3 and it takes me to the second section on page. I want it so that it takes me to the next visible section on the page. I need a way to detect what section the user is currently on and factor that in to my logic so that someone can seamlessly navigate through the page using either their scrollbar or this fixed navigation.

Negative 35 pI have been programming in Scala for a few months now. Im still confused by the many different collections there are.p  pIs there a pagearticle somewhere that shows what each type is best suitable forp  pThe problem with Scala is that it has too many different types, then you have something like Array which maps directly to a Java array, then you have something like Set which is actually a trait but you can use it like a normal class even though my understanding is that a trait is like an interface. The documentation says to implement a concrete set, you need to define the following methods ... but actually I can use it just fine.p  pThe whole thing is really confusing to me. Coming from C.NET, things there were quite clear and I didnt have the odd types like LinkedHashMap and LinkedHashSet.p

Within the toolbar, I have three buttons that are represented with a picture instead of text.p  pThe problem is that I have found that there is a difference in how the buttons are displayed if I create the JButton objects within the constructor, compared to if I did this outside of the constructor but still within the JFrame class.p  pMy code when I create the buttons within the constructor p  precodepublic class Tool extends JFrame      public Tool               JToolbar bar  new JToolBar           JButton button1  new JButtonimg1          JButton button2  new JButtonimg2          JButton button3  new JButtonimg3           bar.addbutton1          bar.addbutton2          bar.addbutton3       codepre  pThen the buttons are added nicely and neatly to the toolbar.p  pHowever, if I do thisp  precodepublic class Tool extends JFrame       JButton button1  new JButtonimg1      JButton button2  new JButtonimg2      JButton button3  new JButtonimg3   public Tool                       JToolbar bar  new JToolBar               bar.addbutton1              bar.addbutton2              bar.addbutton3            codepre  pThen, the buttons are still added to the toolbar. BUT instead of being formatted nicely, they seem to have a border around them similar to if you just copied an image off of google and paste it onto a powerpoint presentation, for example, and you get a square border around the image.p  pWhy is this the case Why does it matter where I create the JButton objectsp  pThank you in advance.p  pEdit complete CORRECT code In the code below, button1 and button2 are created within the constructor, whereas button3 is created outside of the constructor.

Negative 35 pThe Javadoc of the nextLong method of the Random class states that p  blockquote   pBecause class Random uses a seed with only 48 bits, this algorithm will not return all possible long values. a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilRandom.htmlnextLong2829Random javadocap blockquote  pThe implementation isp  precodereturn longnext32 ltlt 32  next32 codepre  pThe way I see it is as follows to create any possible long, we should generate any possible bit pattern of 64 bits with equal likelihood. Assuming the calls to codenextintcode give us 32 random bits, then the concatenation of these bits will be a sequence of 64 random bits and hence we generate each 64 bit pattern with equal likelihood. And therefore all possible long values.p  pI suppose that the person who wrote the javadoc knows better and that my reasoning is flaw somehow. Can anyone explain where my reasoning is incorrect and what kind of longs will be returned then p

Negative 35 pIve have been tasked with extending the general ledger posting for product receipt in an DAX 2012.p  pIn 2012 it seems to me that Microsoft har started a transition away from using the traditional LedgerVoucher, LedgerVoucherObject and LedgerVoucherTransObject way of doing postings to General Ledger, to using the Source Document Framework.p  pIn my case I am to extend the general ledger posting so that extra postings are made, when doing a product receipt. Now when doing a product receipt update, two voucher are actually created. One accounting for the physical receipt of products, and one for accrual of liabilities on product receipt this is set up on the Item Model Group  field group Ledger integration  field Accrue liability on product receipt.p  pIve managed to extend the posting of one of the vouchers by modifying the class InventMovement and the method updateLedgerPhysical which uses the LedgerVoucherTransObjectnewTransactionsAmountDefault way of doing things.p  pThis I found by using the debugger and placing a breakpoint in the above mentioned method, and then back tracing in the call stack where to the correct method.p  pBut for the other voucher accrual of liabilities I am at a loss where to look for the actual general ledger posting, as it seems to me that addTrans method of the ledgerVOucherTransObject is never called for this voucher p  pI have tried debugging at the AOS with CIL and without CILexecution, and I suspect that the source document framework posts to general ledger using some other means than the LedgerVoucher classes.p  pHas anyone got any experience with the source document framework and especially how to add general ledger postings using this frame work and in my case, where I have to look to find the right place for my modicfication.p

Negative 35 pI have recently begun writing a lot of asyncawait code in C using ASP.NET and DynamoDB. I had already selected and setup a hrefhttpwww.ninject.org relnofollowNinjecta as my IoC container.  From what I can find in the Ninject docs and searching online, Ninject has no specific support for async.  That makes sense since it was written before asyncawait was added to C.  However, a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combpfxteamarchive2012041210293335.aspx relnofollowan article on MSDNa about emBest Practices in Asynchronous Programmingem recommends an Async all the way approach.  Is there an IoC container for .NET that supports an async resolve and registering async factories  i.e. if it were supported in Ninject, something like codekernel.GetAsyncltIMyServicegtcode which returns codeTaskltIMyServicegtcode and a register method like codekernel.BindltIMyServicegt.ToMethodctx gt factory.CreateAsynccode where the codeCreateAsynccode method returnes a codeTaskltMyServicegtcode,p  h3ExampleWhy this is neededh3  pI actually had a deadlock in my ASP.NET async code because I was forced to block on async code to understand why this happens, see a hrefhttpblog.stephencleary.com201207dontblockonasynccode.html relnofollowDont Block on Async Codea.

This is my current codep  precodeclass iopool      void Runint threads               make as much threads as user wants  call ioservice.run from all threads          so I have one ioservice, which consumes more than 1 thrread         the server that accepts class server      void Accept               create new session and wait for session to connect           void OnAccept               call session start, and call accept again to wait for more         a connection from a client class session       keep track of a client      holds SendPacket, RecvPacket and stuff like that          here is no problem with multithread since the callback frmo a socket cant be called at the same time    the basic class class client       holds info about character, map etcetc      has also a SendPacket function which calls the session one.    keeps track of all players in maps class worldserver      stdmapltdword  map id, stdvectorltstdsharedptrltclientgtgtgt  to hold info about the players in a map      void AddPlayerdword map id, client         void RemovePlayerdword map id, client      stdvectorltstdsharedptrltclientgtgtamp GetPlayersdword mapid  codepre  pIn the Ioservice pool, I create the one ioservice that I pass around in the entire program.p  pThe problem start when the user or I closes the socket. The readasync function from boost calls the callback function with an error code like thisp  precodevoid SessionStop              msocket.shutdownboostasiosocketbaseshutdownboth         msocket.close          mtimeout.Stop           call here the delete function in tcpserver class       if e  bytestransferred  4                  if e  boostasioerroroperationaborted                 return              Stop             return          codepre  pBut sometimes the error code is not operationaborted when I call the socket.closeshutdown. And this gives an error in my Stop function, since I abort the same socket twice  when I call the delete function which calls the server DeleteClient I get acces violation, cause the class is out of scope.p  pThat also brings my next problem, what happens when another session, is updating movement from itself and wants to send the info to all other sessions in the same map. I call ioservice.post, with the client.SendPacket as info. But if session is deleted by then, this is not going to end well with the same errors as above.p  pWhat I came up with as ugly solution is to delete the session class after 30 seconds with a timer. Since I guess that none of handlers take 30 secs to be called, this should work. Though it looks ugly to me.p  pThanks for reading, I apreciate any all cirtism about the designp  pGrp

Negative 35 pIn my Rails app I have a manytomany relationship between 2 models codeTeachercode and codeCoursecode through a join table. Id like to create some sort of validation where a course cant be created without being associated to at least one teacher it is assumed that all teachers are in the database by the time we are adding a new course. This would be easy to do if this was a onetomany relationship, but with a manytomany relationship, we need to save the codecoursecode before we can associate it with codeteacherscode.p  pMy initial plan was to override Rails codecreatecode method in the codeCoursecode model to allow passing codeteacheridscode and validate presence of at least one codeteacheridcode before saving the codecoursecode, but Im not sure this is a nice approach.p

Negative 35 pI have a method Im writing called emanimatePulseAtSpeed completionem which takes a completion block which will be used in an UIView emanimateWithDuration delay options animations completionem call inside this method as shown below. The problem is I want to add a line of my own to be executed at the same time that this completion block is called. For example, I may want to reposition the frame of the rightPulse UIView referred to in the code below BUT only after the UIView animation below is carried out. So it seems that the UIView completion block is the logical place to put the command to reposition the rightPulse UIView frame. But if I put a line in the UIView completion block to reposition the frame, then it seems that I lose the ability for an outside object to supply a completion block when it calls the method below. It seems that there is an eitheror problem Either I use the emanimateWithDurationem completion block myself or I can have an outside object supply the completion block, but I cant satisfy both needs at the same time.p  pIs there any elegant or simple way to modify the code below so that I let an outside object supply a completion block when it calls this method BUT Im still able to add a command to this same completion block so that it also carries out the additional action I want e.g., reposition the rightPulse frame at the same time p  pThe best solution Ive been able to think of is to use a emperformSelector withDelayem method to reset the rightPulse UIView position so that I dont need to use the animateWithDuration completion block for that. But that seems like a bit of a kludge since the completion block seems to be the natural place for the position reset to be. p  precode voidanimatePulseAtSpeedCGFloatspeed completion voidBOOL finished completion  .

When i removed that privileges the application started at start up.

Only in 8.1 did it cause the software not to start up.p  pDoes anybody know whyp  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pOK to be clearer on the above mentioned update. and comments.p  pThe program works fine. Nothing is wrong with it. When it is checked to run as administrator it does not auto start. When the admin rights are removed. It does auto start.p  pI have done a simple test to see if the software even launches and it does not so logging wont help. I set a message to appear if the application launches so before anything is processed i get notified. Before there can be any errors in code it will tell me. p  pSO the problem is not the coding in the program. The problem clearly is windows 8.1 which does not let my application auto launch on start up when it has admin rights.p

Negative 35 pIve created a little page where you can drag and drop an audio file, which then will be uploaded. Then a waveform is being created and the bpm beats per minute of the audio ar being calculated. Up to here no problem.p  pThen I create a kind of horizontal timeline, where a part of the waveform is being displayed, which will scroll if you play the audio. On the waveform beatmarkers are being drawn. They indicate each beat. I think you know what I mean. Then there is a grid on the beatmarkers which allows to draw up to four notes in every beat  up to three notes one above the other. To be a little musical If a beat is a 14 note every drawn note would be 116 note.

Negative 35 pIm implementing a process pool using Twisted. The ultimate goal is a simple deferToProcess function, much like deferToThread. Im aware of the ampoule module, but Im avoiding it because its apparently not very maintained, because it requires amp subclasses, and because Im interested in writing this anyway.p  pI want to be able to call any arbitrary static function in the current project from deferToProcess. Twisted creates any arbitrary process, so I got it to invoke the current Python interpreter, with a duplicated import path. To find a module level function you could simply determine which module the function resides in, then import the module and call the function. It occurred to me it might be tricky to pass a function reference to say, a static class method or a lambda.p  pTo figure out what my options were, I took a look at Pythons multiprocessing module. Everything I tried worked perfectly, even a reference to a global object in the parent process.p  precodegtgtgt class Testobject ...     staticmethod ...     def test ...             print Found it ... gtgtgt p  multiprocessing.ProcesstargetTest.test, args gtgtgt p.start Found it gtgtgt import sys gtgtgt p  multiprocessing.Processtargetlambda sys.stdout.writehellorn, args gtgtgt p.start hello gtgtgt hmTesting gtgtgt p  multiprocessing.Processtargetlambda sys.stdout.writehm, args gtgtgt p.start Testing codepre  pObviously Python must fork the child processes with all of that data intact. Since Twisted actually spawns fresh processes, is there a reasonable way to try to recover the full path to call a method, assuming one exists e.g. method is not dynamic That includes static module level functions, lambda functions assigned to a module level variable, and static methods of classes.

Basically an inverse of the HEX function.p  pIve come across a couple of suggestions using user defined functions. Problem is, weve only recently upgraded to DB2 10 and new function mode isnt enabled yet, which means I dont have access to any control functions in a UDF. p  pI suspect Im out of luck, but wondering if anyone has any suggestions. I appreciate this is completely the wrong tool for the job, and would be easier to just write a COBOL program to do it, but various constraints are preventing that.

Negative 35 pI had 2 classes, codeBcode and codeCcode, who needed to keep track of their instances, so each of them has an codeArrayListcode of their respective types to which instances were added in the constructor.p  pSince this seemed like common behaviour, I tried to find some sort of standard Java interface or class that expresses this behaviour, something like an codeInstanceManagercode interface. I didnt find anyp  pI ended up trying to write an abstract class for it and I got stuck because I dont know how to specify the specific type of the subclasses. For examplep  precodepublic abstract class C  public static ArrayListltCgt list  public class A extends C   public class B extends C   codepre  pIn this case, codeB.listcode or codeA.listcode would be lists of codeCcode objects, but I would actually want them to be lists of codeBcode and codeAcode objects, respectively.br Is there any way I could make that happen easilybr I am thinking something along the lines ofp  precodepublic abstract class C  public static ArrayListltthisclassgt list  codepre  pbut that would obviously not work.p  pI realise that I could probably use generics to handle this, but it feels redundant and I cant help wishing that there is a way to somehow infer the child class type in this situation.  p  pAlso, is there any standard Java interface for handling instance management or unique instance id generationp  pEDITbr I have come to understand that static variables are not inherited, and the subclasses static variables actually refer to the same thing. As such, is there any way I can define instance managing behaviour without resorting to redundancy, having to write the same things in all subclassesp

Negative 35 pIm using an html5 codeltinput typedategtcode with a knockout binding. Im using webshim for browsers that dont support html5 dates.p  pThe native html5 browsers are working perfectly, changing the date changes the model, changing the model programmatically changes the date shown in the date input.p  pChanging the date on a browser that does not support html5 e.g. IE8 works correctly and updates the knockout model, but the reverse is not true. Changes to the model are not propagated to the webshimgenerated date picker, only to the hidden input that webshim uses.p  pIs there a webshim provided method or event I can call or fire to tell it to look at the data and update the UI after a change How could I write a knockout binding to call thisp

Negative 35 pI am working on a Grails 2.4.3 app which has a page where data get populated into 2 tables dynamically.p  pI could potentially use the HTML table to do this. But am thinking of doing it using EasygridjqGrid.p  pI have seen Grails Easygrid examples where data get populated from a domain class.

Now it will call a function in strongUserSupportControllerstrong and it will search the strongUsersstrong domain class and returns all the users with same first name.p  pAt this point a Easygrid table needs to be populated with data about users. With 3 columns firstName, lastName, ID.p  pI was able to do this by using HTML  tag, but no idea how to do it in Easygrid.p  pCan anyone please tell me how to do thisp  pNow the 2nd partp  pWhen user clicks on a particular row it will populate another table below this with info from strongUserDetailsstrong domain class. So eventually there will be 2 tables in the page.p  pThis is the requirement that am working on now.p  pPlease guide me on how to do this using Easygrid.p  pI appreciate your helpp

Negative 35 pIf you build an object, say Intruder and define it as final, you would still have the ability to change this objects fields which are not final within the classs definition i.e Intruder.power  50.

Im merging two data.tables in this MWE, one has 1 row and the other 2 rows.  The merged data.table has two unique rows, but when I call unique on the merged data.table, I get a data.table with one row.  Am I doing something wrong  Or is this a bugp  pHeres an MWEp  precodelibrarydata.table X  data.tablekeyCol  1 setkeyX, keyCol Y  data.tablekeyCol  1, otherKey  12 setkeyvY, ckeyCol, otherKey X[Y, ]  2 unique rows uniqueX[Y, ]  Only 1 row codepre  pId expect uniqueX[Y, ] to be the same as X[Y, ] since all rows are unique, but this doesnt seem to be the case.p

Negative 35 pI have log messages being received on server at a port 777, and I would like to parse them as they come in rather than saving them to disk and then parsing them.  What is the best way to do this  Ive looked at the socket module documentation, and the examples there dont really apply to my situation.p  ptcpdump has a way to view the messagesp  pcodetcpdump Ai eth0 port 777codep  pThis basically does what I want, it reads the packets as ASCII on port 777 where my logs are, but I want to use Python 2.7.6 not tcpdump.p
Negative 35 pIm trying to make a calorie counter app consisting of 2 activities, the main activity shows the amount of calories accumulated by my second activity which calculates the calories and passes its value to the main activity intent when clicking save, when attempting to add code to pass the values between intents it now crashes the app on load up, I suspect its because there are no values passed on start up but I can only speculate, how would I overcome this any help would be greatly appreciated, explanations more so thanks,p  pMain Activity p  precode    public class

When users login, they use OpenID, and it is not through an actual database under my control. It is through Steam, users login with their Steam account through OpenID. I am able to fetch the users SteamID with this when they log in, and there is even a variable for it. I need to use this SteamID variable when they are logged in to specify which row they are on the database, and print ONLY the logged in users profile fields, rather than just printing all rows in the database. This will be done using the SteamID of the user that logs in which will be compared against the SteamID field on my database, so that it will know which user you are when you log in. p  pI do not know how to accomplish this, which is why I am posting here.

Further, even the act of casting an unaligned pointer to codeunsigned longcode would be Undefined Behavior, since an implementation might not need as many bits for such a type as for a codecharcode.  With a union, however, things seem unclear.p  pFrom what I understand, a pointer to a union is supposed to be equivalent to a pointer to any of its elements.  Does that mean that implementations required to guarantee that a pointer to a union type must be capable of identifying any instance of any type contained therein [thus a codeBYTEORLONGcode would have to be able to identify any codeunsigned charcode], or are programmers required to only cast to union types pointers which would satisfy every alignment requirement of every constituent thereinp

Negative 35 pI like to keep things organized in my applications and since I have only been coding in ROR for a year. I have known how to use the appcontrollersconcerns directory for custom modules to be included in a controller.p  pThis is great however I am wondering if there is a way to add sub folders to the concerns folder to allow for better organization. p  pFor example appcontrollersconcernsmembersprofilemethods.rb and the module is named ProfileMethods. If I include ProfileMethods RubyMine sees the module and allows me to include it, including offering it as an option in the tooltip pane. However the Rails Server says that ProfileMethods is an undefined constant if it is in a sub folder of appcontrollersconcerns .p  pIs there something I have to add to the rails application configuration Any input would be great as it seems a little illogical that you could not further organize the concerns directory with sub folders.p

Negative 35 pThere is a legacy app that I have to make an edit to via VS, but Im not sure what the process involves in recompiling the program. Since nothing else uses VS as its just an app gluing together some things that support a legacy system, I rarely use it so I apologize for the unfamiliarity in how it works. p  pA while ago I lost everything on one side of my computer so I had to copy the app folder from the server that contains the entire app. As of right now I am in the .cs file where I need to update the connection string, because the database it connected to has been changed. Unfortunately anytime I make a change to these files I dont have the option to rebuild the whole app. Is this because the copy of the app folder is not recognized as a project locally What must I do to make these changes and make sure they transfer back to the serverp

But within another old module call to the following function is made to authenticate the userp  precodedef CheckUserRoleroles    below call returns a user object with endpoints internal user ID    since User constructor is not being called with an ldap and so    it falls back on users.getcurrentuser    user  userservice.User   if user.GetUserRole not in roles     raise UnauthorizedException    The userservice.User class snippet class Userobject   def initself, ldapNone     if not ldap       ldap  utils.UserLdap  returns incorrect user object     self.login  ldap  ldap is some internal ID     .... codepre  pThis can be fixed by passing in the ldap returned by the codeendpoints.getcurrentusercode to every User call but that would mean changing a whole bunch of method parameters and constructor calls. I wasnt able to find anything about this anywhere else. Is there a way around itp

After registering all routes, a loop adds the custom handler and culture constraints to every route.p  pSee below the current implementationp  precodepublic class RouteConfig      public static void RegisterRoutesRouteCollection routes              routes.IgnoreRouteresource.axdpathInfo          routes.RouteExistingFiles  true            various calls to routes.MapRoute          foreach Route r in routes                      if r.RouteHandler is SingleCultureMvcRouteHandler                              r.RouteHandler  new MultiCultureMvcRouteHandler                 r.Url  culture  r.Url                   Add the default language                 if r.Defaults  null                     r.Defaults  new RouteValueDictionary                 r.Defaults.Addculture, Culture.nl.ToString                   Add language constraints                 if r.Constraints  null                     r.Constraints  new RouteValueDictionary                 r.Constraints.Addculture, new CultureConstraintCulture.nl.ToString, Culture.de.ToString, Culture.en.ToString, Culture.fr.ToString                             codepre  pstrongCulture enumstrongp  precodepublic enum Culture      nl  1,     en  2,     de  3,     fr  4  codepre  pstrongCustom routehandlerstrongp  precodepublic class SingleCultureMvcRouteHandler  MvcRouteHandler    public class MultiCultureMvcRouteHandler  MvcRouteHandler      protected override IHttpHandler GetHttpHandlerRequestContext requestContext              var culture  requestContext.RouteData.Values[culture].ToString         var ci  new CultureInfoculture         Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  ci         Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture  CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulturenlNL          return base.GetHttpHandlerrequestContext       codepre  pstrongCulture constraintsstrongp  precodepublic class CultureConstraint  IRouteConstraint      private string[] values     public CultureConstraintparams string[] values              this.values  values           public bool MatchHttpContextBase httpContext, Route route, string parameterName, RouteValueDictionary values, RouteDirection routeDirection              string value  values[parameterName].ToString         return values.Containsvalue       codepre  pIn order to convert this to the new AttributeRouting, I just thought Id add a codeRoutePrefixcode attribute to my base controller, which would handle the culture part. strongBUTstrong it seems inheritance of route attributes is not supported...p  pThe a hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvcoverviewreleaseswhatsnewinaspnetmvc52 relnofollowrelease notesa of ASP.NET MVC 5.2 state that inherited route attributes are supported in that version by implementing a custom codeRouteAttributecode and codeDirectRouteProvidercode.

Negative 35 pI have a data set that gets its values from a stored procedure, and Im positive that the stored proc is working correctly since Im getting results in SQL Server. However, when I call the fields in an expression for example, FieldsCustomerName.Value and preview, it just displays a blank spot in its place. If I simply typed some text in that spot, the text does appear when I run it.p  pThe DataSet IS working, and its refreshed to show all of the fields. They just dont display anything in the report, despite definitely returning values when I check in SQL Server. Does anybody have any suggestions as to what steps I could take to fix thisp  pThanks.p

But for every new product family we have to change the existing factories. Also if there is an addition implementation of any product family we have to provide a new factory for this new implementation.p  pFor example p  pI have products Frame and TextBox for two types of OS  Windows and MAC. Now we will have two factories one for each Window and Mac so that WindowFactory returns textbox and frame for Windows and MacFactory return the same objects for MAC. Now say I want to add another OS say Solar then in this case I need to write a new factory which returns the corresponding objects for solar.p  pHow API use this patterns in real worldp

The first is a plain HTTP GET,  where the page is requested without any authentication and the server sends back a 401 asking it to authenticate with some more information relevant to HTTP Digest Authentication scheme. The second HTTP cycle, is when the client sets an Authorization header and requests the page again. If the authentication succeeds, the server returns the page. p  pHowever, this prints only the last requestresponse cycle. I want it to print the first requestresponse cycle too. p

Negative 35 pI am currently working on a computer science project and I am stuck whilst trying to work on the final steps. It is very messy thus far, but the code basically takes the first two values given as x and y coordinates, and uses these to produce a total distance. It also then uses a third point to calculate the total uphill and downhill gradients. I have gotten these parts working correctly, however the assignment states You should read data using scanf until EOF occurs, which can be detected by checking the return value of scanf. I am wondering how I would go about achieving this At the moment I have the constraints of my dowhile loop being that once it  EOF it will terminate, however this causes the code to terminate at any 1 present.

Negative 35 pI have a relatively big project a specific version of ns3 allinone, e.g. nsallinone3.20, containing several modules. I want to keep the src folder of one of these modules module ns3.20 which is a subfolder under projects root folder, and its the parent of my target src folder in a repository. I dont know if it is possible to keep only the src folder on a repository lets say Bitbucketgit and do the control version just for this subfolder, since there are too many files in the whole project domain that will be modified whenever a recompile happens. Therefore, there will be too many unnecessary pushpull for executable files.p  pIn addition, I want to do this subfolder version control via eclipse. I already know how to create a whole project with bitbucket and eclipse. But, I dont know how to have a project in eclipse and control just one subdirectory via git in the eclipse.p  pI appreciate any hinthelp on this.p

Negative 35 pI have two C programs built in Ubuntu, and I want to run them concurrently. I do not want to combine them into one C project and run each on a different thread, as this is causing me all sorts of problems.p  pThe solution I effectively want to emulate, is when I open two tabs in the terminal, and run each program in a separate tab. However, I also want one program lets call this Program A to be able to quit and rerun the other program Program B. This cannot be achieved just in the terminal.p  pSo what I want to do is to write some C code in Program A, which can run and quit Program B at any point. Both programs must run concurrently, so that Program A doesnt have to wait until Program B returns before continuing on with Program A.p  pAny ideas Thanksp

Negative 35 pI wish to find a better way of handling responses than the method I was taught by the company that I worked for.p  pI was taught to use a generic HttpClient, that used volley to send the requests. The client had a static method that would be given a generic listener, ResponseListener, which would make the callback to the context when a volley response came through. The ResponseListener would keep track of all the request types . That is the code given to the client so that the context can differentiate between requests.p  pIs there any other way of keeping track of all the request codes without having to keep one big directory type interface file It becomes quite overwhelming to look at when you get past 100 requests.

The two emanswersem I got was both rather identical, but I chose one of them to mark it as solved.p  pI have, for some time tried to get this to work but I cant and thus I am coming here, hoping for help. I am currently trying to create a login, register and comment function on my website. Registering is working, logging in with those credentials also work, and I have got a filter to prevent emptyfield entries. Once I log in I have it echo out the possibility to go to the comment page, and my plan there is to allow the users to write a comment, see the comments below, and the author name will be grabbed from their login username. See where I am going That is exactly whats not working, though. I cant get it to grab the username from the login field, and I am quite sure it has something to do with that the website doesnt remember the login, and Im unsure how to set cookies and such if thats where the fix would be. So, TLDR  How do I get the website to remember a login, then insert it into a  fieldp  pAbove the code is the website design itself, connection with the database, and sessionstart.

Negative 35 pI have a Web API 2 application with CORS authentication enabled. Locally Im running two sites, a SPA site and the web API, both on port 80, using different host headers.

No matter what I do, the web API gives the good old No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource.
