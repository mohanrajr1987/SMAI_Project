Positive 74049 pIm looking for an example of something I want to do or to hint how to do it. I want to create menu from one side of Viewport of Sencha Touch 2 and after this  to replace this menu with other menu. When I call p  precode Ext.Viewport.setMenumenu,       side left   codepre  pIt working OK but after I call setMenu with other menu the new attached menu replaces old menu and that is the idea. But the problem appears when I want to return other menu. Is there is a way to keep instance of old menu somewhere I just do not want to recreate the previous menu again. I tried to replace second menu with Container but it is no so flexible like menu. p

See the screenshot below  notice how some of the rows are randomly missing the images Also, the last image Dropbox is cropped for some reason.p  pOn a related note, when I do run into this problem, the order of the images also gets messed up.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comLAc6K.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLAc6K.png altenter image description hereap  pThis is how the above screenshot looks like in incognito mode as it shouldp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comX83AX.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comX83AX.png altenter image description hereap  pI have completely cleared out the cache manifest, so it includes nothing. Any ideas how I can fix this Why is it working fine in incognito mode but not in normal mode on the same serverp  pPlease let me know if I can provide any further details to clarify the problem.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.

Positive 74049 pI have following issue. I have created container with inheriting of  Ext.Container and creating some items using items array.

Asynchronous logic can be done into constructor after this  we can add items to container. This decision may cause problems if the asynchronous logic take a long time.

Positive 74049 pHtmlready event not firing on Android 5.0.2 on Samsung Tabletp  pI have a Sencha Touch and Cordova application that has been written for Android and iOS tablets.  However, the application does not seem to trigger the htmlready event on a Samsung tablet with Android 5.0.2.p  pThe reason why I found this was because the tap stopped working on some of my buttons in the app.  Initially I thought that maybe the tap event had changed, however, they are still firing the same in the samsung tablet with Android 5.0.2 and I have seen this using GapDebug so I know that the touch events are definitely firing.p  pThen, I found that all instances where I am registering event handlers on the htmlready event of the panels were not being registered anymore. After putting some debugging alerts and testing whether the htmlready event was fired on an older version of android 4.4.2 on A Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Ed, which it was, that is how I found htmlready not working.p  pI have done ALOT of investigation and debugging I am struggling with how to now register these event handlers. p  pFrom what I have read about Sencha, this would normally be done in the view or the controller config.p  pIn this case, I have done it in the controller config, because the view is not being fully created by using sencha config, but by pulling in existing html.p  pAny suggestions and assistance at this point would be welcome like.  is there an alternative to htmlready  how else could I register these handlers when using an imported html viewp  pIn my app I am usingp  ul liSencha Cmd v4.0.1.45li liNode.js  v0.10.33li liJRE  v1.7.071li liCordova  v3.4.1li liAnt  v1.9.4li liSencha Touch v2.3.1li ul  pI have included sections of the code that I felt are relevant to the issue.

Negative 74049 pI have a report that I built for a client where i need to plot x 0100, y 0100. Lets imagine I have these pointsp  p0,0 2,24 50,70 100,100p  pI need to represent these as a smoothed line chart, as the application of it is a dot gain graph for printing presses.p  pHeres the problem. The line draws fine from 100,100 top right down to 2,24. But then what happens is from 2,24 to 0,0 the line curves out off the left of the graph and then to down to 0,0. Imagine it putting a point at 10,10.p  pI understand this is because of the generic bezier curve algoritm it is using and the large seperation of control points, thus heavily weighting it.p  pI was wondering however if anyone knows a way I can control it. I have tried adding in averaged points between the existing control points but it still curves off the graph as if its still heavily weighted.p  pThe only other answer I can think of is custom drawing a graph or looking into dundas charts and using its GDI drawing support. p  pBut before I go that route anyone have any thoughtsp  hr  pHeres the the thing. I know how to draw the curve manually. The problem lies in the fact that there is such a high weighting between 2 and 50. I tried to add points in at the lows and the mids but it was still bowing off the edge. I will have to go check out the source and modify the graph back and see if i can get a screenshot up. p  pright now I just have the graph stop at 2 until i can get this solved.p

trying to run a crosscompiled kernel in qemu. I am trying to simulate an ARM9 family processor on an integratorcp board.  This is supported under qemusystemarm and this setting is present in the command line far above.  Although I am using the cross build toolchain supplied by scratchbox I am not compiling in scratchbox.  This is because cross support is quite well developed for the kernel and is actually recommended to emnotem be done in scratchbox.  Everything is compiled into this kernel.  Although loadable module support is enabled no modules are being built.  I am able to succesfully produce a compressed binary zImage.  When qemusystemarm inserts it as the kernel it sucessfully uncompresses Linux and almost immediately hangs.  Feeding an uncompressed kernel binary usrsrclinux2.8.16sourcevmlinux to armuclibcgdb for symbol extraction seems to work as well.  Setting breakpoints and stepping through the instructions seems accurate.  I was able to use armuclibcgdb to trap the offending line.  The crash occurs in driversvideoconsolevgacon.c462, inside the vgaconstartupvoid function.  After attempting to step into the instruction inbpVGAIS1RC on line 462 it craps the bed.

Negative 74049 pI have setup custom UITableViewCell from code. In my cell, I have a UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator. When highlighting the cell, it goes blue, and the accessory item turns white. So thats all good.p  pHowever, when tapped and a new view is pushed, the accessory item disappears. When I go back to the tableview the UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator is gone and tappingholding down the finger on the same cell will not highlight it again.p  pIt worked fine last week, but I simply cannot figure out what has prompted this issue suddenly. I cant see anything when I do an hg diff, so was hoping someone would direct me to a possible solution. If you need specific code, please let me know.p  pI have used atebits Fast Scrolling example code and done a lot of customization with it, but the basics and highlighted BOOL has remained the same.p  pPS. In my code, I have also noticed that the UITableViewCell does not stay highlighted when the new view is pushed. I have noticed that Apples own example code, the cell is highlighted when the new view is pushed, and going back to the tableview the cell remains highlighted until the tableview is pushed all the way back into place. Any ideas here Thx.p

Negative 74049 pI created a table without borders styling and I want it to underline a row on hover. However, I am getting pretty odd behaviour. When I move mouse over from upside down, nothing happens. In opposite direction, all touched rows get underlined and stay that way until I move mouse over in some other direction. I am pretty confused by this. I wanted to stay out of jquery for simplicity, but with jquery I get the same result.

While I often contest that claim, I do accept that there is an overall low barrier to entry into PHP which does occasionally attract lower quality people who then produce lower quality work.p  pFor us, quality comes first. Over the course of the next few quarters we also are looking to develop a very high level of competency in PHP. And we want to achieve the highest level of quality and our processes should be such that we are constantly improving all the time while starting off as a high level.p  pOur new recruits are going through a rigorous selection process where there is a very hands on technical assignment. We evaluate how they code, we evaluate how they test their code, we evaluate their skills with industry standard frameworks Zend, CakePHP, CodeIgniterKohana, Symphony.p  pWe have a bimonthly twice a month knowledge exchange event where individuals are encourages to present. We have hands on events as well.p  pI would request you to share your experience on how we as individuals and an a flat, agile, relatively small organization can instill good PHP development practices and constantly improve ourselves.p  pThanks, Srip

Negative 74049 pSo I have been playing with jQuery for a good time now and Im trying to get an effect to work properly. I have a main square div in the middle of the page and when someone clicks a link I want the box to look like its falling off the page and disappear, revealing a new page behind it. Iv been playing with the easing plugin but I can seem to get what I want to work. Basically I have the divs top margin or just top distance increased to a large number. However, this just makes the div fall but it also expands my page and its just much lower on the page. I basically want the div to fall out of site and not change the dimensions of the site. Anyone know how to do thatp  pThanks Dannyp
Negative 74049 pIve got an iPad app with a drawer table displayed in a popover. The user can tapandhold on an item in the drawer to drag that item out of it and into my main view. That part works fine unfortunately, the view being dragged appears under the popover, and is too small to be visible until its dragged out from underneath it. If I add the view as a subview of the view controller eminem the popover, it gets clipped by the popovers frame, and as I cant access the codeUIPopoverControllercodes view, I cant disable its layers codemasksToBoundscodeand that probably wouldnt be a great idea anyway. I suspect that I could use an additional codeUIWindowcode with a high codewindowLevelcode value to force the dragged view to appear on top of the popover, but this seems like overkill.

As i understand the docs, the read should either return normally and not close the channel or close the channel and throw ClosedByInterruptException.

Negative 74049 pAttempting to simulate client area based window dragging by returning HTCAPTION under a WMNCHITTEST excluding HTCLIENT amp appropriate areas works flawlessly when used with a parent window  however presence of child windows such as tabs placeholder windows, even when set to the extended style WSEXTRANSPARENT, cause clicks to fail to pass WMNCHITTEST messages to the parent window and attempting to process local WMNCHITEST messages in a similar fashion produces the expected effect of dragging the child window around the parent rather than the parent itself. p  pGiven that every area in that tab child window appears to be considered to be client area, processing WMLBUTTONDOWN instead appears to produce the desired effect see belowp  precode    case WMLBUTTONDOWN          SendMessagemainWnd.hWnd, WMNCLBUTTONDOWN, HTCAPTION, lParam      break      codepre  pWhere mainWnd.hWnd is the parent window handle hWnd is a member of a designed window properties helper classp  pAlthough this produces the desired effect, Im confused at whether WSEXTRANSPARENT is actually meant to allow clicks to pass through to underlying windows, and whether there is a more appropriate solutionp

Negative 74049 pWhat are the differences between shared pointers such as boostsharedptr or the new stdsharedptr and garbage collection methods such as those implemented in Java or C The way I understand it, shared pointers keep track of how many times variables points to the resource and will automatically destruct the resource when the count reaches zero. However, my understanding is that the garbage collector also manages memory resources, but requires additional resources to determine if an object is still being referred to and doesnt necessarily destruct the resource immediately.p  pAm I correct in my assumptions, and are there any other differences between using garbage collectors and shared pointers Also, why would anyone ever used a garbage collector over a shared pointer if they perform similar tasks but with varying performance figuresp

Negative 74049 pHere is some background on the problem.  p  pWe have a database of vehicles.  The data is purchased from a third party and imported.  Some columns in the database have symbols in their values Trade mark, Copyright etc...p  pexamplep  pKawasaki Ninja ampreg tm.p  pWe have a Controller which handles the displaying the vehicles from a database but one of the parameters from the route is used as a criteria in pulling data from the database.p  pSo we will have routes that look like thisp  pKawasakiNinjap  pwhich will display all Kawasaki Ninja bikes.  There is a single action in the controller which takes the values from the route Kawasaki and Ninja and generates a SQL statement to pull all Kawasaki Ninjas from the database.  Here is where the problem is the data in the database is not always going to be clean like I stated above it will have different symbols.  p  pIs there a elegant solution to this where I can easily look up data in my database by using the Route that zend provides me.  Having the special characters in the URL isnt a valid solution according to the business rules so that has been ruled out.  We have also looked into cleaning the data in the database and removing any unwanted symbols.  That however would require changes to the way data is imported or having a script run through the database and do cleaning.  We would like to be able to leave the data in tact and avoid any type of wild card searches against the database.  This mapping needs to be able to be done both ways from the database to url and the url to databasep  pThanks in advancep
Negative 74049 pI would like to convert some of our MyISAM tables to InnoDB so I can take advantage of foreign key support.  However, most of the tables use a twocolumn composite primary key design in which one of those columns is an autoincrement this was done for historical reasons and also ensured that the autoincrement column could act as a kind of incremental key for records within the context of the other columns valuep  pI realize that we need to do away with the multicolumn primary key in order to use autoincrement and InnoDB.  We have thousands of records though and these records have relationships to other tables. p  pAre there any tips on how to convert these tables to InnoDB  The only method Ive come up with is to first add a new column in each table, set it as the sole autoincrement primary key and then use scripts to update the dependent tables to point to the new truly unique primary key.p  pThanks Stevep

Negative 74049 pIm writing a web application in Symfony for the first time, so I have a question regarding the use of Doctrine vs. Stored Procedures.p  pMy background is in Java serverside, so I wanted to know what the pros and cons are for using stored procedures, versus using simple Doctrine code to get things done. At the most basic level, lets say that my Symfony web application is used for management, while theres another engine which might or might not be written as a Symfony component, or indeed not in PHP at all which retrieves configurations from the database for distribution or whatnot. Here I can see where stored procedures might be handy both code bases use them to query and access data, while neither are preoccupied with the actual schema. If theres a change to the schema adding a column in some table, for instance, then Id only have to change the SRPOC, and nothing else, whereas if I had been using code in both engines to access data, Id have to change them both to match the new schema.p  pAny comments Or did I take it too farp  pThanks DBGp

Negative 74049 pI find the internal plumbing of git really fascinating. At least on a conceptual level it is simple and very elegant.

There seems to be some difference in the internal formats, though, since modifying the script header and text content only leads corrupted tree or commit entries, andor nonmatching checksums. Are the other objects stored in a different manner, compared to blobs, and in which way p  pThe pretty printed output from catfile and the other objects, dont seem to bear very much resemblance with the actual storage file implementation.p  pAccoring to a hrefhttppeepcode.comproductsgitinternalspdf relnofollowGit Magica, the tree object format isp  precodetree SP ltcontent lengthgt NUL ltpermissionsgt ltfilenamegt NUL ltchecksumgt codepre  pbut Im unable to generate the correct checksum for this, with my measly ruby skills.

For example, if ZoomPercent  200, it will draw it at a 200 or 2.0 ratio, so a 1000x1000 bitmap would be drawn as 2000x2000.p  pIn my head, the code above should work, but its not.  For example, if the Bitmap is 800x600, then the width is greater, and if the ClientRectangle is 1000x1000, then it should calculate 1000  800  1.25  100  125.  So 125.  Which will stretch the bitmap to be 1000x750 which fits within the ClientRectangle.  However it is not working in all circumstances.p

Negative 74049 pI am busy with a project where I will be implementing a tree structure for relating objects to one another.  I found a great article describing the logic and coding for a nonbinary tree a hrefhttpdvanderboom.wordpress.com20080315treetimplementinganonbinarytreeinc relnofollowTreeltTgt Implementing a NonBinary Tree in Ca.  I see this as a good implementation.p  pMy question, however, relates to the fact that I am wanting to develop this using a Domain Driven Development approach. So, what comes up in the design process is how will my combined domain model of the tree and my other objects equate to a data persistence modelp  pBecause the Tree implementation uses generics, the domain object which stored the data will be oblivious to the fact that it is a part of the tree.  So I am struggling to get my mind around how this will equate to data retrieval and persistence using a repository pattern and nhibernate, for example.p  pMy initial thinking is that I would need to implement a very specific custom repository that would handle the traversal of the tree and persistence thereof.  However, it is quite hazy at the moment.p  pIs there anybody out there who has done something like this and can share their experience or offer some codep

This might be caused by the codeCraueFormFlowBundlecode Im using, so Ill check it out.p  pThe working codeconfig.ymlcodep  precode twig     debug            kernel.debug     strictvariables kernel.debug     form         resources              Formformlistlayout.html.twig codepre  pEDIT 2 Doesnt look like its anything to do with the codeCraueFormFlowBundlecode, is there anything in my configuration that might be causing it to ignore the global form layoutp  pEDIT Actually, it is working. As soon as I changed my layout file to include my list elements instead of the table layout content, it appeared okay.p
Negative 74049 pPretty selfexplanatory. Whenever I set the contents of a label, any spaces at the beginning or end are removed. Ive looked at the API and found little to help me. setExtraSpaces will add spacing to the top and bottom, which I dont want. Something like setLeft doesnt seem to add any actual space  perhaps some other layout is conflicting to cause that not to happen but even then it seems like a bit of a work around. So, basically, I just want to know if theres any way to make the content exactly what I put inp
Negative 74049 pI have a SQL table that I cannot change the structure of.p  pThe table EmployeeTeam has 5 columns TeamID, Employee1, Employee2, Employee3 and Employee4. The fields of columns Employee1, Employee2, Employee3 and Employee4 contain an EmployeeID. Each Employee ID has a City in the table Employee. Its possible to have multiple employees on the same row of EmployeeTeam that are living in the same town. There will always be at least 1 employee that will live in the town Im looking for.p  pimg srchttpwww.atriasoft.comtable.png altexamplep  pExample p  pI want the first employee that lives in New York. In the case of TeamID 01, it will be Employee2 I dont want Employee 4 even though his city is New York and for the case of TeamID 02, it will be Employee1 I still dont want the second employee that lives in New York. p  pI currently have a code that gives me every employee that lives in New Yorkp  precodeSELECT     FROM EmployeeTeam  INNER JOIN Employees     ON Employees.EmployeeID  EmployeeTeam.Employee1 OR        Employees.EmployeeID  EmployeeTeam.Employee2 OR        Employees.EmployeeID  EmployeeTeam.Employee3 OR        Employees.EmployeeID  EmployeeTeam.Employee4  WHERE Employees.City  New York codepre  pWhat I am looking for is a code that takes only the first employee living in New York.  Any hints will be much appreciatedp
Negative 74049 pI have used UnitOfWork and Repository patterns in my application with EF.p  pActually my design provides that the UnitOfWork would create the ObjectContext class and inject inside the Repository concrete class. For examplep  pstrongUnitOfWork.cs initializationstrongp  precodepublic DefaultUnitOfWork      if context  null          context  new MyDataContextConfigSingleton.GetInstance.ConnectionString       codepre  pstrongUnitOfWork.cs getting a repository instancestrongp  precodepublic CustomerRepository Customers      get          if customers  null              customers  new CustomerRepositorycontext                  return customers       codepre  pThis way the Repository classes have an already defined ObjectContext class and they can use its methods to retrieve and update data. This works nice.p  pNow I need to execute my queries impersonating the Application Pool Identity so I have decided to wrap the code in the constructor of the UnitOfWork within the impersonation.p  pUnfortunately this does not work because the codeObjectContextcode is then passed to the Repository constructor and used later when a client of the repository calls, for example, codeFindAllcode.p  pI have experienced that the real connection to the database is made right before doing the query by Entity Framework and not exactly when I am creating the codeObjectContextcode itself. p  pHow can I solve this problemp

Negative 74049 pIm trying to check if my arrays are returning nonsense by accessing out of bounds elements, in fortran. And I want to check these values are less than one, and if they are, change them to one.p  pThis is the piece of my code causing issuesp  pcodelastNeighLabelclusterLabeljj1,kk,ll, clusterLabeljj,kk1,ll, clusterLabeljj,kk,ll1code LastNeighLabel contains the cluster label between 1 and n, where n isthe total number of unique seperate clusters found for the last neighbour in the x,y,z direction respectively.p  pWhen codejjcode or codekkcode or codellcode are 1, they try and access the 0th element in the array, and as codeFORTRANcode counts from 1 in arrays, it tries to destroy the universe. Im currently in a tangled mess of about 8 ifelseif statements trying to code for every eventuality. But I was hoping there was a way of operating on each element. So basically Id like to say codewherejj1,kk1,ll1.lt.1 do clusterLabeljj1,kk,ll0 etccode depending on which element is causing the problem.p  pBut I cant think of a way to do that because where will only manipulate the variables passed to it, not a different array at the same index. Or am I wrongp  pWill gladly edit if this doesnt make sense.p

Negative 74049 pIn my project build definition the SettingKey useProguard in the Android scope is set to true.  This is what I want by default.  When I execute one particular task, however, I want useProguard to be false.  Everything in the Android scope comes from the sbtandroidplugin.p  pIm not sure how best to solve this problem.  From what I read it seems like a command can get the job done, since it can execute a task with a different state than what your current session sees.  I tried to create such a command like sop  precodedef buildWithoutProguard  Command.commandbuildwithoutproguard  state gt   val extracted  Project.extractstate   import extracted.    val transformed  session.mergeSettings  useProguard in Android  false   val newStructure  Load.reapplytransformed, structure   val newState  Project.setProjectsession, newStructure, state   Project.evaluateTaskbuildAndRun, newState   state  codepre  pIm appending the command to my project settings and running the buildwithoutproguard command executes the buildAndRun task as desired.  However, useProguard is still true instead of false as I would expect.p  pFirst, this whole approach feels heavy handed to me.  Assuming changing sbtandroidplugin isnt an option here then how else would I solve this problemp  pSecond, why doesnt this approach work as isp

Negative 74049 pCan I Use both Adobe Flash cs5 and OpenGL to create an application on an android OS4.3 device p  pI am creating a 3D chess game compatible for an android OS 4.3, so I am using eclipse and the SDK obviously.p  pThe problem I have now is I am meant to make the chess pieces human like. For instance, the pawn pieces should look like miniature foot soldiers and the king piece should be a figure of a person sitting on a throne etc. I started with OpenGL but because I am new to it, I might not be able to carry put displaying the graphics with OpenGL. So I decided to use adobe flash cs5 to create the pieces and use OpenGL to make the chess board because I can do that and also because in my specs, I said I would be using OpenGL. p  pI want to know if this will actually work and also if there is a much easier way of doing this I just havent thought of. Any suggestions would be appreciated, especially how to implement this with the A.I.p  pIf anyone has a sample or an idea I could work with, I will also be very grateful.p

Negative 74049 pstrongShortlystrongp  pI cannot figure out what is the common reason of codenetwork Cache entry not found [url ...]code messages appearence in Java console during applet running in web browser. Ive get that this one can appear when performing with codejava.net.URLConnectioncode requesting some data from the Internet but still dont know about its any possible reasons to look for to investigate my particular problem. So my questions are strongwhat are possible reasons of this message and can this affect applications normal run Finally, what is the cache and can I control it somehowstrongp  pstrongIn detailstrongp  pIt will be too difficult and unnecessary to post big code snippets so Ill try to describe the problem as simplier as possible.p  pI am building an applet based on a hrefhttpworldwind.arc.nasa.govjava relnofollowNASA WorldWinda and facing a very strange behavior when requesting tiled image layers calling corresponding applets method from JavaScript. Tiled image layer is a layer that can overlay 3D Earth and consisting of sets of fixedsize pictures tiles which are to be requested separately during layers loading suppose, layer is something like a puzzle of tiles . Thats why each tiles request has its own thread.p  pInitially I had an a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase1.4.2docsapijavasecurityAccessControlException.html relnofollowAccessControllerExceptiona due to each tile request thread had no permissions to make crossdomain requests and readsave load results to local file cache. This problem has been solved by wrapping tile requests actual code byp  precodeAccessController.doPrivilegednew PrivilegedAction       Override     public Object run            Requesting tile and performing with the result...          ...       codepre  pAs the result, I see that tiles are loaded and stored in local file cache directory. But I still dont see the layer on the Earth. The fact is that I get the following network messages in Java consolep  precodenetwork Cache entry not found [url httpcaches.scanex.rugetTile.cgiTBMNG012004ampL0ampX4ampY1, version null] network Connecting httpcaches.scanex.rugetTile.cgiTBMNG012004ampL0ampX4ampY1 with proxyHTTP  192.168.4.108080 codepre  pI was able to find a place in the code when these messages appear  when getting HTTP response codep  precodeHttpURLConnection htpc  HttpURLConnectionfconnection responseCode  htpc.getResponseCode codepre  pThen, I found out that codejava.net.URLcode instance provided for codeURLConnectioncode and other preparations are also made in another thread.

But Im still confused by codeCache entry not foundcode messages cause they are left in Java console and appear for each requested tile. Thats why I want to know  strongis such behavior normal, and what do these messages actually meanstrongp  pP.S. For interested people  a hrefhttpcaches.scanex.ru relnofollowhttpcaches.scanex.rua doesnt work from outside at the moment.p

Negative 74049 pWe are implementing MDM solution in house.

But device doesnt receive any notifications. Can someone throw some light on this Thanks in advance.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Found couple of issues in our implementation. push API takes device token and payload. We were incorrectly using pushmagic as token in push API. Also devices send the device token in base64 format during initial checkin. So it needs to be converted to hexa format and used in push API.p  pWith these two changes, we are one step ahead. Now feedback service is returning a message saying that the corresponding device is inactive. We tried reinstalling the profile and used the latest push magic and device token. Still Feedback service is returning the same message. p

Negative 74049 pI have big problems with installing rails on my debian PC. I tried different versions of gems and rails but in the end all they lead to one or more serious errors and not working framework as the result. Currently i tried to install latest versions of all sets with gem installupdate, tried gem install rails with dependenciesi, also tried to intsall gems with rvm gemsets. As i understand, my problem related to pure matched gems sets, so i thought, is there any special packages that include working stable set of gems and rails framework, can anybody give any hints, where to search for them Also my problem complicated by the fact, that my hoster use old version of ruby  1.8.7, so i need to work on my pc with that version.p

Negative 74049 pIf I load a DLL with codeLoadLibrarycode, is that DLL guaranteed to stay loaded If not, how can I prevent reloading.p  pActual situation I have a dispatcher which, depending on some messages, needs to load one of several dlls and execute some function from them. I cant link against them at compile time, so I use codeLoadLibrarycode. Because there can potentially be a lot of calls, Id prefer not to have to call codeLoadLibrarycode every time, since it turns out its a bottleneck. So I was thinking to only call it once per DLL, calling codeGetProcAddresscode to get the function also only once per dll, and cache it somewhere. But is it safe Am I guaranteed that calling that function will be ok on any subsequent call If not, how can I have this guaranteep

Negative 74049 pThis is odd.  I have a website running under a .Net 2.0 app pool Integrated mode and couldnt connect to a WCF service on the site.  A message reading The requested content appears to be script and will not be served by the static file handler would pop up whenever I navigated to the URL on my box.p  pI checked the handler mappings in IIS for this websites .svc extension and saw entries reading codesvcIntegrated4.0, svcISAPI2.0 and svcISAPI2.064code.  But nothing for svcIntegrated, which I assume was the problem.p  pI followed the ServiceModelReg i recommendations in a hrefhttpblogs.microsoft.co.ilblogsburstegarchive20081201wcfoniis7onvistaaddingsvchandler.aspx relnofollowthis posta, but there was no instance of that executible in my Frameworkv2.0.5027 subfolder.  So I went up a level and found it in my Framework3.0.0 folder, and ran it from there.  Lo and behold, things work now and theres a new handler for svcIntegrated in the mappings section.  p  pBut my question is if I installed this for .Net 3.0, how is a .Net 2.0 app pool making use of it  I thought there would be a compatibility issuep
Negative 74049 pI spent about a week learning and using OGLES 1.0.  I realized I needed to use 2.0 for some features that I found appealing.  I have been working on converting from 1.0 to 2.0 for a couple days now.  I have finally hit a point where I am not getting errors That I can find and have a screen rendering.  All I see is the clearcolor though.  I have tried changing things around and reading ALOT to figure out what my problem is but I just cant find the answer   So here I am asking you why all I see is the clearcolor.  Assuming my parser is correct it was working flawlessly for 1.0 my BufferObjectsarraysindices are correctthey were for 1.0 my problems is in the code I am posting.

Negative 74049 pIve been experimenting with writing webapps in Clojure, and its been pretty easy until now. I followed Chas Emericks excellent screencast a hrefhttpcemerick.com20120502startingclojure relnofollowstarting clojurea and got an url shortener up and running pretty quickly. Next I wanted to be able to deploy it, and thats when the trouble started. p  pWhen I run it in development or deploy it to Jetty as the root webapp, everything is fine, but when I deploy it with a context path, it doesnt. Or, rather, it almost works. All my Compojure routes still work, but codeFORMcode action links in HTML files are broken and give me 404s.p  pThis is the Compojure route setupp  precode  defroutes app     rtresources      GET  request homepage request     POST shorten request           let [id shorten gt request params url]             responseredirect      GET id [id] redirect id    def app compojure.handlersite app codepre  pAnd here is the HTML for the homepage templatep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtInsert title herelttitlegt     ltlink typetextcss relstylesheet hrefsite.css gt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform methodPOST actionshortengt         ltinput typetext nameurl gt         ltinput typesubmit valueShorten gt     ltformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThe problem is the codeactionshortencodeURL. When deployed to Jetty with a context path of codeexamplecode everything work fine, until I trigger the form submit. Then Jetty complains that it cant find codelocalhost8080shortencode which means I think that its not being treated as a relative path, but an absolute one. p  pSo, my question is how to fix this I guess I could just specify the full path in the action link, but that would be inflexible and make it harder to run the servlet in development. Is there a way to configure my way out of this Or some magic URL prefix like codecode in Razor that will just do the right thingp

Negative 74049 pIve only got a small amount of experience with AB testing but from what Ive seen it seems like the standard approach to do an AB test is to introduce some conditional logic in an applications code. This can be tricky to implement properly depending on the complexity of the test and requires extra work both for setup and cleanup.p  pIt got me wondering are there any frameworks or approaches to AB testing that simplify matters using, e.g., Git branches Im envisioning something at the load balancer level, which directs half of traffic to a server where master or default has been deployed, and the other half to a server with experiment deployed. This way the code itself could always be completely agnostic of any AB tests going on and presumably the act of choosing either A or B for full deployment would be a simple flip of a switch.p  pIm sure this would not be trivial to set up properly. But still I wonder if its possible, and if in fact its already been done.p

Recently, I had to close a pull request, and ask them to checkout a new branch from the dev branch, and make the changes there, as the dev branch was very far ahead of the master branch, and merging would have been very tricky.p  pSo, I decided to make codedevcode codemastercode, and make codemastercode codestablecode.p  pThe first thing I did, with codedevcode checked outp  precodegit branch m master stable codepre  pThen switch to the new branchp  precodegit checkout stable codepre  pThen move codedevcode to codemastercodep  precodegit branch m dev master codepre  pSo, locally I now had two branches, codemastercode previously codedevcode and codestablecode previously codemastercode.p  pI then checked out each branch individually, and ran codegit push origin ltbranchnamegtcode for each.p  h2Problemsh2  pThe first problem I noticed, was that even after the push, on the new codestablecode branch was master, I get this upon codegit statuscodep  precode On branch stable  Your branch is behind originmaster by 6 commits, and can be fastforwarded.  nothing to commit working directory clean codepre  pgit still thinks that remotely this branch is associated with codemastercode, and because I made codedevcode into codemastercode, it thinks that codestablecode is behind. How can I get git to associate this branch with the correct remote onep  pThe second problem I noticed, on GitHub, branch codedevcode still exists. How can I remove the remote versionp  pThe third problem, on GitHub, if I select branch codemastercode, below it says latest commit to the codedevcode branch. Will that change with a few commits Same goes for the other branch it says latest commit to codemastercode for codestablecode.p  pHow can I get the remote fully uptodate with what is in my local repop
Negative 74049 pI am currently working on the localization of a website, which was first in english only. A third party company did the translations, and provided us with an excel file with the translations. Which I successfully converted to a PHP array that I can use in my views. Im using Eclipse for Windows to edit my PHP files.p  pAll is fine, except that I need to add variables in my strings, exp  precode1 is now following 2 codepre  pIn arabic I was provided with strings like this onep  precode   codepre  pI find that replacing emem with 1 and 2 is incredibly difficult because the arabic part is a right to left string, and the code1code, code2code will be considered lefttoright, or righttoleft, and Im not sure . I hardly have the results I expect with the order of my param, because 1 will sometimes go to the left of the string, sometimes on the right, depending on where I start to type. Copypasting the replacement strings can also have the same strange effects.p  pMost of the times I end up with a string like this onep  precode2  1 codepre  pThe 1 should be at right hand site, the 2 at the left hand site. The code1code is obviously considered righttoleft string because the  appears on the right. The code2code is considered lefttoright.p  pIm sure someone as this issue before. Is there any way it can be done easily in Eclipse Or using a smarter editor for arabic issues Or maybe it is a Windows issue Is there a workaroundp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI also tried splitting my string into multiple strings, but this also changes the order of the parametersp  precode1 .   . 2 codepre  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pIt seems that changing the replacement string makes things better. It is probably linked to how numbers are handled in Arabic strings. This string was edited in Eclipse without any problem. The order of the parameter is correct, the string is handled correctly by PHPp  precodevar2   var1 codepre  pIf no other solution is found, this could be a good alternative.p
Negative 74049 pIm an iOS developer looking for a solution to a tricky problem.  I need to create a grid view mosaic view to layout cells of strongdifferentstrong sizes both width and height.p  pI basically need the functionality of a GMGridView, with horizontal scrollingpaging, the ability to edit, and drag cells to new locations, thus rearranging the entire grid view. Ive looked at all of the current open source grid views out there, and found none with variable sized cells.p  pOne solution I have thought about is 2 tableviews both rotated for the horizontal scrolling, and then intercept some UITableView scrolling methods, to then scroll the other tableview together. This is not ideal, as I will be unable to move a cell from one view to another, and Im not sure how happy apple will be about it.p  pI also know of some possible confidential support for this coming in the next version of iOS, but would like to keep my app supporting previous versions of iOS.p  pThanks for any insight you can provide.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1rc8d.png althttpbigreddog.com.aufilespedalsgridviewscreenshot.pngp

Negative 74049 pDisclaimer  Ive only been using C for about a week now, so hopefully this isnt a n00b question. I did look around, but was unable to find a solution that worked, including the results from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions315237getthecomboboxtextincsharpthisa thread.p  pI have a combobox on a Windows form. The comboboxs data is populated from an Access database. The emrelevantem properties that I have set are  AutoCompleteMode  Append AutoCompleteSource  ListItems DropDownStyle  DropDown. The users must be able to type in the combobox and it autocomplete, so the DropDownStyle of DropDownList will not work. Instead of using the default drop down arrows I have a dynamic PictureBox replacing it. Clicking on the PictureBox or triggering the Enter event will set the DropDowned property of the combobox to true.p  pAs it currently is, users can select items just fine or type in items and press enter or type in items and leave the field, etc.... During all of those different types of interactions I am able to determine what the correct value in the combobox is. I have certain triggers to ensure that the SelectedValue and the displayed Text are always in sync. p  pI am able to get the correct value under every possible interaction, that I could think of, except for one. If the user starts to type a string with the DropDowned property  true and hits the right arrow key to have the string autocomplete, the string in the combobox is always a null string.p  pVisualp  pSelectedstrongTextstrongp  pThe bolded text in the above string is the highlighted text in the combobox. If the user then hits the right arrow key to make the text in the combobox look likep  pSelectedTextp  pNote that DropDowned is still true at this point the ComboBox.Text value is always .p  pHere is the code for one of the ComboBoxes DropDownClosed event, which is the first thing that is triggered once the user presses enter.p  precodeprivate void cmbxYearDropDownClosedobject sender, EventArgs e              try                      if cmbxYear.Text.EqualscmbxYear.SelectedValue.ToString                              if bUpdated amp bErrorFound                                      validateDatacmbxYear, clrYear, false, imgFilter1, imgNoFilter1                     updateTable                                           imgFilter1.Visible  false             imgNoFilter1.Visible  true                  catch                      imgNoFilter1.Visible  false             imgFilter1.Visible  true               codepre  pI also just discovered that the ComboBox.Text is always a null string when the DropDowned property  true and a user has typed something in and then presses Enter. This is not the case if the DropDowned property  false. When that occurs the correct string is returned.p  pI have even tried having the program select all of the text in the comobox however, giving a value for the SelectionLength greater than the ComboBox.Text.Length does not appear to work. I have also tried referring to the SelectedValue however, the SelectedValue is null.p  pFor all intensive purposes the application is convinced that there is a null string in the combobox.p  pHow can I retrieve the actual stringp  hr  pIn case this helps I have code for the following events Click, DataSourceChanged, DropDown, DropDownClosed, Enter, KeyDown, Leave, and Validated.p

Negative 74049 pIt seems and maybe Im wrong that if you want to preserve the timezone of when something happened with JDBC and Postgres you need to store the timezone separately from the timestamp.p  pThat is I would prefer to give my ORMJDBCJPA a Java codeCalendarcode or Joda codeDataTimecode with say timezone codeAmericaNewYorkcode to a Postgres codetimestampzcode field. AND I would expect on retrieval regardless of the Servers timezone or defaulting to UTC to give me back a codeCalendarcode with timezone codeAmericaNewYorkcode. But just looking at most JDBC code and things that depend on it that doesnt happen.p  pstrongIs this correctstrongp  pThis seems ridiculous that I would need to store the tz in another field when postgres supports it.p  pThus it seems like the only two options arep  ol liSelect the codetimestampzcode Postgres column as a codejava.util.Stringcode and parse it.li liStore the timezone as a separate field.li ol  pOption number one and two one would require some sort of conversion interceptors for my SQL mapping  ORM libraries.p  ul liWhat is the best solution for JDBC li liWhat is the best solution for JPA if different than JDBCli ul

Negative 74049 pI have an MSI package I maintain with Installshield 2012 Pro. p  pThe package was created a few years again and requires periodic maintenance as new versions of the application is installs are released by our development team. This MSI has been used in many locations, on many machines without issue. p  pAt one customer location, theyve install about 20 copies of the application on 20 machines. Each machine is built exactly the same.  Periodically, for an unknown reason registry entries relating to that application go missing. Not all of them, a select one or two... the same entries always go missing. p  pWe so far have failed to track the exact root cause, however one of our support engineers noticed the MSI repair dialogue appearing when they opened the application shortcut. Following this, the registry entries went missing. p  pOn each instance of the registry entries going missing we have removed the MSI from the cWindowsInstaller directory. On machines weve made this change too, the registry changes so far have not disappeared again. p  pThis leads me to think the MSI is somehow removing the selected registry entries during the repair, but I dont understand how. p  ul liThere are at least 50 registry entries under the same key as the entries that get removed. these are created by the application not the installerli liThe MSI package doesnt insert any keys at all during installli liThere are no custom actions at allli liI only have one key file set in the whole MSI, and this is for a component installed in Windowssystem32li liNone of the shortcuts are Advertisedli ul  pThere appears to be a clear link between removing the MSI from the Installer directory and no further occurrences, but I fail to see what in my MSI could cause specific registry keys to disappear. p  pI realize the exact reason this this is subjective to my MSI or the customers systems, so as generally as possible I askp  ul liWhy would Windows launch the MSI repair function, considering the aboveli liCan an MSI alter the registry, considering the aboveli liIs there anyway post installation of an MSI to disable the auto repair function for this MSIli liHow should I alter the MSI to ensure auto repair doesnt occurli ul  pThanks p

Negative 74049 pIm currently revamping my application. I have a method called Test in my controller which is being currently being called my many pages.

Negative 74049 pIn my app, i use a dual panel layout where each buttons on the left side replaces the fragments at the right sideFrame Layout.p  pThe FragmentTransaction.replace method actually removes the current one and add another fragment, so i need to create new instance everytime when switching between Fragments.p  pHow can i save the fragment instance and replace Or is there anyway to switch between the fragments without replacing themp

Negative 74049 pWhen retrieving rows from a Google AppEngines datastore, we would like to implement retrieval of all data of an entity type, with several, simultaneous, processes.  The processes run asynchronously in backend Python servers. The point would be to have each process retrieve a chunk of the whole data set, so that we can nearlyevenly distribute the load across all of them, like thisp  precode    .....        p1   p2    p3     p4    p5    p6    p7         pk1   pk codepre  pWhere each codepncode is a process and all the entities are retrieved.p  pI think the way to enable this is to somehow say something like this in Pythonp  precodechunksize  numentities  numchunks basequery  select  from entity offset d limit d  for chunk in range0, to  numentities, stepby  chunksize      cursor  getcursorbasequery, offset  chunk, limit  chunksize      while isreadycursor         dotaskwithdatacursor.next codepre  pWhere codegetcursorcode would get a cursor from AppEngine which scrolls from results starting from the given offset.  I am only including the codelimitcode argument here in case it helps, but it could also be enforced inside the codewhilecode loop, for example.  In any case, we would hopefully like to get a situation where queries are not On with limit and offset i.e. the last queries have to scroll through nearly all the data before fetching data.p  pAnother option might be distributing entities based on some random value which we do have, using a range of 0  1 divided into chunknum chunks.p  pIt might even be possible to somehow get a data dump out of App Engine and then work on that although due to size it would not be our first choice.p  pWhat would be a good way to achieve this  Is there a better way to solve this problem  Any ideas on this would be really appreciated.p

Negative 74049 pAre there any goodbest practices regarding the combination of Spring configuration and OSGi Blueprint e.g. Gemini Blueprint Which XML files do you use Where do you put them in your OSGi bundles codeMETAINFspringcode, codeOSGiINFcode Which of these practices will allow you to reuse your bundles in combination with a nonGeminiimplementation of Blueprintp  pBackground We are in the process of switching from SpringSpring DM to SpringBlueprint. I am aware of Blueprint defining a codeltbeangtcode element. However we occasionally face the situation that the limited bean definition capabilities of the Blueprint specification do not meet all our needs. So it seems to be a good choice to use Spring configuration within our bundles and Blueprint for wiring bundles via OSGi services.p

Negative 74049 pI am currently working on a project that must support 6 different languages. I already have a working implementation using resource files for strings and form localization for controls. The final part of the implementation involves changing the language in real time while the program is running. I have seen advice of how to do this, and I ended up using a modified version of the ApplyResources method. In general, Im talking about this kind of thingp  precodeComponentResourceManager resources  new ComponentResourceManagertypeofForm1 CultureInfo culture  new CultureInfofrFR  resources.ApplyResourcesmybutton, mybutton.Name, culture codepre  pThus, the button mybutton text would then get changed to the French localized version. This is working for all of my forms and controls, EXCEPT for a particular ListView control. This ListView has 5 columns of object type ColumnHeader. I am trying to change the text of the column headers to the new language using ApplyResources. I have already added the appropriate French text in the .fr.resx resource file for the column headers, and the Designer View is showing me the French translated version when I switch the form localization to French, just as expected.p  pEven further, I tried changing the global thread currentUICulture property to French before the forms InitializeComponent method in the constructor. I verified that this will load the correct French resources for the column headers in the list view. p  pHowever, my problem arises when I try to manually apply a culture to the ColumnHeaderListView resources. For example I will say the code looks approximately like thisp  precodeComponentResourceManager resources  new ComponentResourceManagertypeofmyUserControl CultureInfo culture  new CultureInfofrFR  resources.ApplyResourcesmyListView, myListView.Name, culture resources.ApplyResourcesmyColumnHeader1, myColumnHeader1.Name, culture this.Refresh codepre  pNo matter what I try, I cant get the French resources to be applied to the column header text. I also triedp  precode resources.ApplyResourcesmyListView.Columns[0], myListView.Columns[0].Name, culture codepre  pAnd I tried something similar after searching for solutions on stackoverflowp  precode var lv  ListViewmyListView  foreach ColumnHeader col in lv.Columns        resources.ApplyResourcescol, col.Name, culture   codepre  pSame effect  no language change. I looked at the Designer.cs code to see if there was any critical difference or line I was missing and it looks like I am doing it correctly. All of the other controls change language correctly but the column headers in my listview refuse to change text dynamically. Has anyone seen this before What am I doing wrong here p  pIn the very worst case, I can just move the text for the column headers to the external resource files and then manually set the text of each column header, but I find that to be a big hassle, especially if I have to deal with listviews later that have many columns, or if the text needs to have multiple values for each language. Help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 74049 pJust to give a big context of my idea.p  pI have to consume a Java Service.

So some procedures do things like this...p  precodeWHERE COLUMN  NVLPARAMNOTMARKEDASNULLABLEINSERVICE, COLUMN AND COLUMN2  NVLANOTHERPARAMNOTNULLABLEINSERVICE, COLUMN2 codepre  pSo you must know that is not the same if a consume the service like thisp  precodeWSClient.somemethod0, 0,0 codepre  pthan like thisp  precodeWSClient.somemethodnull, null,null codepre  pThis last one will return some result when the first one not.p  pI cannot change the service, I cannot request them to change the definition of the WSDL because is autogenerated for them. They know nothing about Java, just plsql.p  pI manually changed my autogenerated proxy to test, if this idea would work, and changed the parameter types of a method to nullables, I tested it, and, as guessed, it worked like a charm.p  pThe service is continously changing, some parameters are added, deleted, improved, etc, so when is a change on the service I generate the proxy again and just copy and paste it to my projectp  pI generate the service like thisp  precodesvcutil  ctSystem.Collections.Generic.List1  httpMyurlwsdl codepre  pI think it would be really painful if I have to manually change every method every time I regenerate my proxyp  pIm open to use another software, to use an special command of svcutil, to use another tool, whatever, but Im looking a way to change the value paremeter types of the methods to nullable types, I have to remark that just method parameters  not all the parameters, because some objects definition, in fact have properties with nullable types and they can be null from the origin.p  pI know Im asking something that is wrong, the real solution should be that the service would be interoperable, but as I said, I cannot ask that.p  pI dont think a manually Find and Replace to look that is a method and change it to   should be the best idea.p  pI would really appreciate any help.p  pRegards,p

Negative 74049 pIm currently building a voxel engine like Minecraft for example, and Im using opengl.p  pThe current design of the engine looks like thisp  blockquote   pclass Map  contains 2d array of chunks stdvector of   stdvector p      pclass Chunk  contains 3d array of block also using stdvectorp      pclass Block  contains the vertices of the blocks. cubes, built from   12 trianglesp blockquote  pWhat I want to do is make every chunk have a draw function which will draw all the blocks in the chunk. I thought Id make a buffer for each chunk using glGenBuffers. From the tutorials I read should first create a vertex array with glVertexArray and than bind it, than bind a buffer to it with the target GLARRAYBUFFER and fill it with data.p  pSo far I managed to render a single chunk with a number of blocks using a buffer which created in the chunk with glGenBuffers but in the main function I create glVertexArray and bind it, than call the draw function in the chunk and it bind the chunks buffer and drawing using glDrawArrays.p  pMy question is, it is right to create a VBO for each chunk I need to create a glVertexArray for each chunk too or I should use one for all the chunks and every time bind another VBOp  pI tried to study more about the VAO and the VBO throught tutorials and the opengl wiki but so far I didnt fully understand how it works and how it should be used properly.p

Negative 74049 pI am building a Control Chart where the user selects an interrupt date and I would like to place the StripLine immediately embeforeem that. So, lets say a user selects July 2009 as their interrupt date, Id like to place the StripLine at June 2009. Based on how I got the image below it looks like I need to use indexbased placement. How can I determine where on the chart June 2009 is The user can also select the start and end dates so it would vary chart to chart.p  pIf it matters the horizontal axis labels are MYYYY but the values are YYYYMM for sorting.

So far in terms of content we either put it in some properties file read in by the JSP for copies eg. description of product X or backend service that provide dynamic content eg. whats the current value of product X. p  pNow we are rethinking our approach to managing content because we are managing more and more properties for the client with the same content eg. a website, mobile website, mobile app, etc, so we definitely want to avoid having multiple copies of the same content spread around.p  pA few things I am particularly looking forp  ol lipJavabased because we are Java shop 1 more expertise in handling Javabased stuff and 2 avoid introducing another tech to the stackpli lipExtensibility  customization.

Negative 74049 pI use Google Chrome Dev Tools to troubleshoot or debug JavaScript. I add break points and use watches, but a lot of the times its convenient to just insert codeconsole.logvaluecode here and there in the script.p  pThe problem is that when the page has to be refreshed in order to see the JS changes and the codeconsole.logcode calls, then the codeconsole.logcode calls have been removed when the page reloads. Obviously this is because I didnt edit the actual source file itself.p  pIs it possible to maintain edits to JS files and still reload the pagep  pThere are a lot of cases where Im looking at other peoples JS, learning and understanding it, so editing the source code is not even a possibility. Other times, when working on my own code, I might be debugging JS code on a live server, to editing my source to put in random codeconsole.logscode is not desirable.p  pI know that Dev Tools has an auto save feature where the changes you make can save the actual source files as long as the files are on a filesystem that is available to your computer. But that doesnt help in my case.p

Negative 74049 pI have been searching all over to find a solution for my problem. I have a Flot line chart that is inside a jQuery Flippy div. I basically wanted to have the Flippy so that you could switch between a chart and a table with a cool effect. p  pThe button to start the Flippy works fine and just shows a simple div for now. However, when you click the other button to reverse the Flippy go back to the chart, the data on the chart has gone. The axis and labels are there, but there is no line. Im not sure whether you have to redraw the chart, I have tried lots of ways of creating a button to redraw the chart, ideally I would like it to redraw the chart when you click the button to reverse the Flippy. p  pThis is the js code I have for the Flippy buttonsp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt document.readyfunction      btnreverse.onclick,functione         .flipbox.flippyReverse         e.preventDefault           btntop.onclick,functione         .flipbox.flippy             colortarget b6d635,             direction top,             duration 200,             verso ltspan styleheight300px classbiggtOther side of Flippyltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltspangt,                    e.preventDefault        ltscriptgt  codepre  pThis is the js that creates the chart in the first place when the page loads it is included in a separate PHP filep  precodevar plot  .plot.chart,        [  data sin, label Total cost , color ee7951 ],             series                 lines  show true ,                points  show true             ,            grid  hoverable true, clickable true ,            yaxis  min 0,                      tickFormatter currencyFormatter ,            xaxis                  mode time,                 timeformat b y,                                      codepre  pFinally this is the HTML that renders the chart and also the two buttons for the Flippy and Flippy reverse.p  precodelta classbtn idbtntop hrefgtFlipltagt lta classbtn idbtnreverse hrefgtReverseltagt   ltdiv classrowfluidgt     ltdiv classflipboxcontainergt       ltdiv classspan11gt         ltdiv classwidgetbox flipboxgt           ltdiv classwidgettitlegt ltspan classicongt lti classiconsignalgtltigt ltspangt             lth5gtTotal Usage Costslth5gt           ltdivgt           ltdiv classwidgetcontentgt             ltdiv classchartgtltdivgt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pIf anyone could advise why the chart loses its data when you use a Flippy or suggest how I could make the chart redraw when the Flippy reverse button is pressed, it would be very helpful.p

Negative 74049 pI have a data.frame with a quantity of predictors each of type factor and a responseoutcome column.

This results in a table per column, so Id then have to yet again loop through to sum up each WoE and store it in a table.p  pSince then I have started using plyr and can do basic summary and transform actions on data but this seems far outside of the basics.p  pstrongCalculationstrongp  precodeWeight of Evidence WoE  sum  Factorlevel WoEs  codepre  pWhere each factor level WoE is calculated as codeloggoodContributionbadContributioncode and Contributions are defined as codeNumber of [goods] for factor  total number of [goods]codep  pstrongExample of the step by step calculation for a emsingleem columnstrongp  precodeexampleltdata.framecolAfactorrepletters[13],4,                     colBfactorrepletters[46],4,                     colCfactorrepletters[810],4  outcomeltfactorrepc1,0,6,labelscbad,good  wip lt as.data.framextabsformula  examplecolA   outcome wip lt dcastwip, example.colA  outcome wipbadTotalltsumwipbad wipgoodTotalltsumwipgood wipbadContributionltwipbadwipbadTotal wipgoodContributionltwipgoodwipgoodTotal wipWOEltlogwipgoodContributionwipbadContribution  outputsltdata.framecolccolA,WoEsumwipWOE codepre  pstrongUPDATESstrongp  pThe WoE calculation comes out at 0 in the example.

Negative 74049 pIm new to this site  So I apologise if Ive done anything wrong.p  pBasically, I currently have a PHP and javascript Paypal form, which provides 9 dropdown questions to my customers. After they have entered this data, they are then able to click a Paypal button and the price automatically shows with the amount dependant on their choices.p  pHowever, as Paypal has a description limit  I was wondering if its possible for this form to send the user a Paypal page, and then send me an email with their data entry too.p  pIts for a Custom Gaming Controller business, so I need to know ALL of their personalisation choices.p  pA database seems too complicated... As I will constantly keep updating the choices.p  pI have the dropdown bit sorted, and the Paypal button sorted. It all works completely fine using .csv files for the variables and prices. However, I need it to send an email to myself.p  pCan anyone do thisp  pIf you need to see the current code, just let me know. Could really do with someone doing this for me.

Negative 74049 pI have a nix server where the access privileges are restricted for certain folders to admin accounts only.  In order to access some of these folders, we use the pbrun command to tell some daemon to access it for us I think.  p  pI need to copy an entire folder in a secure directory one of the directories that I pbrun into onto my windows computer not a server, just a regular PC.p  pI guess Ill need to use SFTP to SSH into the server and grab the files, but since I dont have access to the files on my account, I cant SFTP with my credentials.  Also, I dont have passwords to the account Im pbrunning on, so I cant just SFTP directly using that account.

Negative 74049 pI wanted to check that my push notification implementation is correct. p  pEach time I open my app in actual fact I register the push channel only on a specific page so its each time I go back and forth from that page a new push channel URI is created which I store in my mobile services database to send push notifications to. This doesnt seem correct to me as each time the apppage is opened a new push channel URI is generated and so the list of channel URIs just grows and grows for each device that uses my app. Id assume that you create a push channel, store the channel URI and push to it as needed. I will make note here that I am using raw push notifications.p  pI understand that push channels will expire every so often but for me its occurring each time I back out of the apppage and therefore when onNavigateTo is called I find the push channel which does exist and a new channel URI is always created. Is this correct p  pMy code is as followsp  pprotected override void OnNavigatedToNavigationEventArgs e                     registerPushChannel          p  precodeprivate void registerPushChannel               The name of our push channel.         string channelName  RawSampleChannel           Try to find the push channel.         pushChannel  HttpNotificationChannel.FindchannelName           If the channel was not found, then create a new connection to the push service.         if pushChannel  null                      pushChannel  new HttpNotificationChannelchannelName               Register for all the events before attempting to open the channel.             pushChannel.ChannelUriUpdated  new EventHandlerltNotificationChannelUriEventArgsgtPushChannelChannelUriUpdated             pushChannel.ErrorOccurred  new EventHandlerltNotificationChannelErrorEventArgsgtPushChannelErrorOccurred             pushChannel.HttpNotificationReceived  new EventHandlerltHttpNotificationEventArgsgtPushChannelHttpNotificationReceived              pushChannel.Open                   else                       The channel was already open, so just register for all the events.             pushChannel.ChannelUriUpdated  new EventHandlerltNotificationChannelUriEventArgsgtPushChannelChannelUriUpdated             pushChannel.ErrorOccurred  new EventHandlerltNotificationChannelErrorEventArgsgtPushChannelErrorOccurred             pushChannel.HttpNotificationReceived  new EventHandlerltHttpNotificationEventArgsgtPushChannelHttpNotificationReceived               code which passes the new channel URI back to my web service                                 protected override void OnNavigatedFromNavigationEventArgs e              pushChannel.Close      codepre  pSo to clarify, the app is opened and the push channel is registered and the channel uri is saved in my web service. The web service then sends notifications to the channel uri. When I exit the app or page and return to it, the push channel is found but a new channel uri is created which I again save to my web service. My channels table in effect just keeps growing and growing. p  pSo is this the way it should work with new channel URIs continually generated It kind of doesnt make sense to me. Im not sure how toast and tile notifications work but Id assume the channel URI needs to be static when the app closes to keep receiving notifications while the app is closed, but perhaps that could be a functionality of bindtotoast and bindtotile and so what Im doing is correct because its to do with raw notifications.p

Negative 74049 pI have a script that runs via CRON that processes each row or user in one of the tables in my databases, then uses cURL to pull a URL based on the username found in the row, and then adds or updates additional information into the same row.

For instance, since I have the script in CRON, I would like to have it run every 5 minutes and it would run through 10 rows, stop, and then somehow know to pick up the next 10 rows when the CRON job starts again. I have no idea how to accomplish this however. p  pAny help would be appreciatedp

Negative 74049 pLets say you have an app that automatically resizes images when a page is loaded, then it stores those in an image cache folder with the dimensions as a suffix, so it wont have to recreate the image next time. p  pThats a sweet function there.p  pNow for whatever reason someone hotlinks the image and theyre all like man, thats a cool image. Im going to use it. and youre like okay, have fun  but then because you have a very slight case of severe alzheimers, you cleared your cache. p  pMan, that sucks. p  pAll hot links are broken p  pBut, theres a solution up ahead in the distance. If we could somehow use php and modrewrite.htaccess to route the nonexistant404 image to a script that will take the filename as a parameter, parse out the dimensions and original filename, then not only replace and resize the lost image but also echo out the image data with the headers, then that would be sweet.p  pMy question. What would the rewrite rule that I use in .htaccess to route image requests that 404 look like.p

Negative 74049 pCurrently I have a kernel that uses the following texture reference a 3d texture of type codeunsigned charcodep  precodetextureltunsigned char, 3, cudaReadModeElementTypegt  volumeTexture codepre  pHowever, I need to be able to exchange the textures type. I already templated the kernel so it is able to handle different types. But I was unable to exchange the textures type or the texture itself while maintaining the old state i.e. being able to handle codeunsigned charcode and codeunsigned shortcode at the same time.p  pThats why I thought of using the texture object API. However, this API does not seem to support 3d textures. The available resource types are codeLinearcode, codeArraycode, codeMipMappedArraycode and codePitch2Dcode. None of them seem to be designed for 3d textures. Does the texture object API really not support 3d textures at allp  pAre there any workarounds I could use a 2d texture where the slices are just stacked on top of each other. However, the necessary height for a 512 entries volume 512512262,144 exceeds the maximum texture2d height 65,536 on my device. So I would have to organize the slices both next to each other and on top of each other, which would result in pretty dirty address calculations which I would like to avoid.p  pAnother way would be to copy the kernel code and exchange the texture reference. But thats not a very clean solution. Can the reference itself be templated somehowp

And as you can see if the num of characters is 0 we set the error                 variable to true and show the nameerror div with the fadeIn effect.                  if its not 0 then we fadeOut the div thats if the div is shown and                 the error is fixed it fadesOut.                   The only difference from these checks is the email checking, we have                 email.indexOf which checks if there is  in the email input field.

I have defined a default parent package using the struts2 convention plugin and also defined the package rcg.console which extends from strutsdefault and tilesdefault packages. However, when I start my tomcat server, I get the following exception. But, if I change the codeParentPackagevaluercg.consolecode annotation on my action class to codeParentPackagevaluetilesdefaultcode, the error goes away. If I dont define the codeParentPackagecode annotation, struts is not able to detect my tiles resulttype. Can anyone please help me with thisp  precodeSEVERE Exception starting filter struts2 Unable to load configuration.

Negative 74049 pIve been running into the same issue as described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21769908howandwhenisfontdisposedforwinformscontrolsthis questiona. That is, Fortify complained about the creation of font objects, for which the codenew Fontcode statements are generated code in the designer.cs files. When looking at profiling results I do get the impreesion I need to do something about this, at least in some cases.p  pThis is, of course, an issue only if the develper has assigned a font of his choice to the form in the graphical designer. My plan is to undo that choice and to create the Font manually after the call to codeInitializeComponentcode and then call codedisposecode for the Font in the codedisposecode method of the form. Since that way I do create the resource myself and checked whether it is used elsewhere Im sure it is not shared and can safely allow its disposal. Up to that point Im rather confident about the issue.p  pNow the codedisposecode method of the form is generated as well when the form is created and has a boolean codedisposingcode parameter. What Im uncertain about and this is my question is whether I can ignore this parameter, or have to check it for true or false before calling codefont.disposecode. I have to admit I do not yet understand the dispose logic in these generated winforms.p  pMore specifically the generated code looks as followsp  precode     ltsummarygt      Clean up any resources being used.      ltsummarygt      ltparam namedisposinggttrue if managed resources should be disposed otherwise, false.ltparamgt     protected override void Disposebool disposing              if disposing ampamp components  null                      components.Dispose                  base.Disposedisposing      codepre  pAssuming a font for form myForm is affected, Id create it usingp  precode...  InitializeComponent  this is generated into the constructor this.myForm.Font  new System.Drawing.FontNiftFontName,... ... codepre  pand would call codethis.myForm.Disposecodeto dispose it.

Negative 74049 pIm trying to design a relatively complex system, using Vagrant and SaltStack to handle control and provisioning.  strongThe basic idea is to provision a machine, called master, which runs the SaltStack master that all my other machines will connect to.strongp  pIn a previous attempt to do this, I just had Vagrant set up a Salt minion which was instructed to install the salt master and a dns server package.  But Id like to simplify key transports by using Vagrants facilities.

In codesetTimeoutcode, you can specify milliseconds. p  pSo far, this is how Im designing the typeEffect it types fine, but I can keep hitting the type button which keeps rerunning the script.p  precodetypeEffect  function index      responseButton.propdisabled, true wait until typing is done before user can press again     game.data.enableCycle  false      setTimeoutfunction           npcdialog.appendgame.data.NPCdialog.charAtindex         index         if index lt game.data.NPCdialog.length              Utilities.typeEffectindex                  else              game.data.enableCycle  true             Utilities.hoverText after type effect, replace appended letters with full dialog, run hoverText to split it into spans for hover text             responseButton.propdisabled, false             npcdialog.htmlgame.data.NPCdialog              , 50      , codepre
Negative 74049 pI have a series of static classes that I use to populate and access data in a stdmap.p  pWith them static, it is easy to set it up so that the map only gets populated if its ever needed, and only needs to be populated once.p  pSomething along these linesp  precodeclass MyClass  public   string atint key        PopulateEmptyMap     return myMap.atkey     private   void PopulateEmptyMap        ifmyMap.empty       return     PopulateMap       void PopulateMap        myMap[1]  str1     myMap[2]  str2       static mapltint, stringgt myMap  codepre  pThe actual class is more involved, with multiple maps, but you get the idea.p  pI have a series of classes like this that are virtually identical except for the types and values of the maps.p  pInstead of having multiple classes all reproducing the same code, Id like to have the code exist in one place, but I cant figure out how to do so.p  pMy first thought was to inherit from a template class that has all of the shared code.  The function PopulateMap would become pure virtual, and then implemented by each inheriting class.  This doesnt work, of course, because its impossible for the function to be both static and virtual.p  pWhat are my options for doing what Im tryingp

Negative 74049 pI know that some answers have been provided for similar questions, but none of them seemed to be suitable for my issue. Im making a program to generate images for Granny Squares, or squares that have different color rings on the inside.  pThe user is able to select how many rings there are, and therefore the number of colors necessary will change. Therefore, I cannot use nested for loops to go through each color as the number of for loops would have to change. Is there a way I can create combinations for these colors pFor example, if I used the colors White, Blue, and Green, the following combinations would be White, White, White White, White, Blue White, White, Green White, Blue, White etc. So is there a way to accomplish this without nested for loopsp

Lets assume that the item numbers have been classified based on some code words. In the second list, there are again Item No.s, Name and Country but some item numbers havent been filled  since they are new and have not yet been sorted. Now, I want Excel to compare the names AND countries of both data and provide the common Item No. output if there is a match. If there is no match, then I would like Excel to tell me that this is a new entry. I looked up on various forums and I realized that VLOOKUP command only allows me to search on Name OR Country would give me the common entries of NamesCountries respectively but not Item No.s. Is there any formula that could help me solve this problemp

Consider the diagram below, where the order in which connections are made is changed note also that there can be multiple shortest paths for any given edge, see green and  purple connections. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comigEwd.png altenter image description herep  pMy intuition says this is NPComplete and that an exhaustive search is necessary, which will be extremely expensive as the size of the graph grows. However, I have no way of showing this, and it is not quite the same as other graph embedding problems which usually concern minimization of crossing.p
Negative 74049 pI have been experimenting with linear and relative layouts to achieve the result in the link below.  Ideally, I want to place view B to the right of view A which is no problem whatsoever and have the bottom of view B be along a horizontal line roughly 34 the height of view A.  Is there a way for me to assign the bottom position of view B relative to the height on view A without referencing the parent container  Perhaps setting the bottom of view B to some dy from view As horizontal centerlinep  pAll attempts with margins and padding positive and negative, gravity, and aligning to the parents various walls have proved fruitless.  I usually end up bringing in excess height to the parent view or cutting off part of view B.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzi5gh.png altp

Negative 74049 pI know this has been discussed in other threads, but Ive very new to coding websites in general, and when I try to use the solutions others have come up with, they just dont seem to work. And I apologize if my terminology isnt quite right, but hopefully youll be able to understandp  pOn the site Im building on my localhost, I have it so that the Bootstrap navbar Im using remains collapsed on desktop, tablet, and mobile. The navbar is a sticky nav, and when you select an item from the menu it scrolls down to the items anchor.

Standard will have a Transparent background for the setter and pressed states, while the Light will be codeColor.FromArgb153, 00, 00, 00code, and the Dark will be codeColor.FromArgb153, 64, 76, 87code.p  pXAMLp  precodeltStyle xKeyButtonStyle1 TargetTypeButtongt         ltSetter PropertyBackground ValueTransparentgt         ltSetter PropertyBorderBrush ValueStaticResource PhoneForegroundBrushgt         ltSetter PropertyForeground ValueStaticResource PhoneForegroundBrushgt         ltSetter PropertyBorderThickness ValueStaticResource PhoneBorderThicknessgt         ltSetter PropertyFontFamily ValueStaticResource PhoneFontFamilySemiBoldgt         ltSetter PropertyFontSize ValueStaticResource PhoneFontSizeMediumgt         ltSetter PropertyPadding Value10,5,10,6gt         ltSetter PropertyTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltControlTemplate TargetTypeButtongt                     ltGrid BackgroundTransparentgt                         ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt                             ltVisualStateGroup xNameCommonStatesgt                                 ltVisualState xNameNormalgt                                 ltVisualState xNameMouseOvergt                                 ltVisualState xNamePressedgt                                     ltStoryboardgt                                         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetPropertyForeground Storyboard.TargetNameContentContainergt                                             ltDiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime0 ValueStaticResource PhoneButtonBasePressedForegroundBrushgt                                         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFramesgt                                         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetPropertyBackground Storyboard.TargetNameButtonBackgroundgt                                             ltDiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime0 ValueTransparentgt                                         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFramesgt                                     ltStoryboardgt                                 ltVisualStategt                                 ltVisualState xNameDisabledgt                                     ltStoryboardgt                                         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetPropertyForeground Storyboard.TargetNameContentContainergt                                             ltDiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime0 ValueStaticResource PhoneDisabledBrushgt                                         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFramesgt                                         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetPropertyBorderBrush Storyboard.TargetNameButtonBackgroundgt                                             ltDiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime0 ValueStaticResource PhoneDisabledBrushgt                                         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFramesgt                                         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetPropertyBackground Storyboard.TargetNameButtonBackgroundgt                                             ltDiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime0 ValueTransparentgt                                         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFramesgt                                     ltStoryboardgt                                 ltVisualStategt                             ltVisualStateGroupgt                         ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt                         ltBorder xNameButtonBackground BorderBrushTemplateBinding BorderBrush BorderThickness0 BackgroundTemplateBinding Background CornerRadius0 Margin0gt                             ltContentControl xNameContentContainer ContentTemplateTemplateBinding ContentTemplate ContentTemplateBinding Content ForegroundTemplateBinding Foreground HorizontalContentAlignmentTemplateBinding HorizontalContentAlignment Padding0 VerticalContentAlignmentTemplateBinding VerticalContentAlignmentgt                         ltBordergt                     ltGridgt                 ltControlTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt         ltSettergt     ltStylegt codepre  pI have the following method codeUpdateButtonStylecode that is called in codeOnNavigatedTocodep  pXAML.CSp  precodeprivate void UpdateButtonStyle              var style  Application.Current.Resources[ButtonStyle1] as Style           if Settings.TransparentMode.Value  false Standard Theme                      setter background and pressed background state will be Transparent                  else                      if Settings.LightTheme.Value  false Dark theme                              setter background and pressed background state will be Color.FromArgb153, 00, 00, 00                          else Light theme                              setter background and pressed background state will be Color.FromArgb153, 64, 76, 87                            codepre  pHow may I adjust these parameters in the code behind accordinglyp

Negative 74049 pIn this problem, I have to find all matching keyvalue mappings within two maps and then return it into a new map, but I am running into some problems. My idea is to find all matching keys from the two maps, then use these keys to reference it to the values. If the values matched, I would put the keyvalue into the map. I am trying to find out why it just adds all the keys that are in common it only add those keys if its corresponding values match too. Thanks.p  pThe promptp  pWrite a method intersect that takes two Maps of strings to integers as parameters and that returns a new map whose contents are the intersection of the two. The intersection of two maps is defined here as the set of keys and values that exist in both maps. So if some key K maps to value V in both the first and second map, include it in your result. If K does not exist as a key in both maps, or if K does not map to the same value V in both maps, exclude that pair from your result.

Negative 74049 pWe have a app that keeps track of unique users. Earlier we tracked them using the UDID. As Apple deprecated the use of UDID and it no longer supports the use of UDID. p  pThe problem here is when a user installs the app we can know the users unique id by the Vendor identifier. p  pOur app functions this way. When a new user installs the app then a vendor id is generated and sent to server. this is unique for that user. but when the same user uninstalls and again reinstalls the app. again a new vendor id is generated.p  pHow can I prevent the duplication of the user ids. Is there any alternative solution for this.p  pThanks,p

Negative 74049 pAs I understand it a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHSLandHSVHSL and HSB colour spacesa are very similar, both use the same 0360 colour wheel for hue and the same 01 value for saturation. The one difference between them is that in the HSB model you have brightness, where 0 is black and 1 is the colour at full intensity, while in HSL you have lightnessluminosity, where 0 is still black but 1 is white.p  pThe .net codeColorcode struct uses the RGB space, but has codeGetHuecode, codeGetSaturationcode and codeGetBrightnesscode functions.p  pThe documentation here is confusing. For codeGetBrightnesscodep  precode ltsummarygtGets the huesaturationbrightness HSB brightness value for this   System.Drawing.Color structure.ltsummarygt codepre  pOk, so makes sense, .Net appears to be using HSB...p  precode ltreturnsgtThe brightness of this System.Drawing.Color. The brightness ranges   from 0.0 through 1.0, where 0.0 represents black and 1.0 represents white.  ltreturnsgt codepre  pEr... so the max value represents white, rather than the brightest colour. Despite the fact that their documents and naming consistently refers to embrightnessem Im pretty sure that the value returned is actually emlightnessluminosityem, i.e. .Net actually uses the HSL model and not HSB.p  pCan anyone confirm this Is it an error in the documentation, an error in codeGetBrightnesscode, or am I misunderstanding the theory somehowp
Negative 74049 pI am trying to rebuild my application using storyboards. p  pLet me first explain what my goal is I have a map with multiple pins and annotations with discloser buttons. When the button is pressed, I would like a DetailView to pop out with multiple information about the pin for example title, images and description. p  pHow I achieved this with .XIBs I added every pin with the coordinates and then created a new .xib file for each pin and said that if the title of the annotation was equal to ... then load .xib with title .... The detail .xib had all the information that I wanted to implement. p  pNow with storyboards, how can I achieve the same effect without having to create multiple storyboards and view What I am trying to say is that I would like to have one view where I can populate it depending on what pin was pressed. p  pThank you for your helpp  pDavidep

Is there any way to customize this further I would like to be able to limit users to the outboundinbound UI, or at least prevent them from having the ability to charge many thousands of dollars to the attached credit card. For clarification, my use case is to distribute API keys to contractors or vendors so that all email gets sent through a single account.p  pI have found very little official Mandrill documentation on this.

Negative 74049 pI have a web application coupled to a services framework. The framework starts like any Java application and at the end of the boot sequence, it starts catalina tomcat in the same JVM. I use JVM 7 and Tomcat 6.0.39.p  pI created a new service that should reuse from an existing one that have view , model and controlle. For the webapps part, I use struts.p  pAt start, the new service should have been done in a good architecture but, as the time is short, I want to reuse parts of code from the existing application which is not well designed.p  pI need to use a class that have other dependent classes and that class is in WEBINFClassescom.... and used by the existing webapp.p  pMy first try was to add to the JAVA classpath the path to xxxwebappsWEBINFClasses where all the required packages are. I ran the full application and my new service was OK. The problem is that Ive got Apache Tomcat unhappy telling it could not load struts  ActionForm.p  pIve made then the following test on a application version that runs OK, Ive just added to the classpath in script used to launch the JVM the path to xxxwebappsWEBINFClasses. I started the application and Ive got the problem directly. If I removethe reference to xxxwebappsWEBINFClasses then everything goes well.p  p1st question Is the classpath used when startingup the JVM inherited by catalina when is started via Catalina.start in the same JVM instancep  p2nd question I have the feeling that if a class is in the JVM classpath and present in the xxxwebappsWEBINFClasses too then apache Tomcat is confused and it says it cant find anymore struts classes.

Negative 74049 pIm running a remote IPython notebook server on an EC2 instance on AWS. The instance is running Ubuntu.

When creating a new notebook in the remote server, I am able to save. Problem only occurs for notebooks pulled from my git repository. Also, when opening a problematic notebook, and deleting all cells until its absolutely empty, I can sometimes  save the empty notebook, and sometimes  I still cant.p

Not knowing the key name to witch the value belongs may have strange results during deserialization. For Example during deserialization I could pass a new class with the same layout, containing a record with different memory layout. In this case the values will be randomly assigned or an AV could occurem p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Im using Delphi XE7. Also I found this of json.orgp  blockquote   pJSON is built on two structuresp      ul   liA collection of namevalue pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed   list, or associative array. li   liAn ordered list of values.

Negative 74049 pI hope answering my question would not require a lot of time, because it is about my understanding of this topic.p  pSo, the question is about block and grid sizes for concurrent kernels execution.p  pFirst, let me tell about my card it is GeForce GTX TITAN, and here is some of its characteristics, which I think are important in this question.p  pCUDA Capability MajorMinor version number    3.5p  pTotal amount of global memory                 6144 MBytes 6442123264 bytesp  p14 Multiprocessors, 192 CUDA CoresMP     2688 CUDA Coresp  pWarp size                                     32p  pMaximum number of threads per multiprocessor  2048p  pMaximum number of threads per block           1024p  pNow, the main problem I have a kernelit performs sparse matrix multiplication, but it is not so important and I want to launch it simultaneously in several streams on one GPU, computing different matrixes multiplication. Please, notice again the simultaneous requirement  I want all the kernels start at one moment, and finish at the anotherall of them, so the solution when these kernels only partly overlap doesnt satisfy me. It is also very important that I want to maximize the number of parallel kernels, even if we lose some performance because of it.p  pOk, lets consider we already have the kernel and we want to specify its grid and block sizes in in the best way.p  pLooking to the card characteristics we see it has 14 sm and capability 3.5, which allows to run 32 concurrent kernels. So, the conclusion I make here is that launching 28 concurrent kernelstwo per each of 14 SM would be the best decision. The first question  am I right herep  pNow, again, we want to optimize each kernels block and grid sizes. Ok, lets look to this characteristic p  pMaximum number of threads per multiprocessor  2048p  pI understand it this way if we launch a kernel with 1024 threads and 2 blocks, these two blocks will be computed simultaneously. if we launch a kernel with 1024 threads and 4 blocks, then two pairs of block will be computed one after another. So, the next conclusion I make is that launching 28 kernels each one with 1024 threads would be also the best solution  because  this is the only way when they can be executed simultaneously on each SM. The second question  am I right here Or there is better solution how to get the simultaneous executionp  pIt would be very nice if you only say am I right or not, and I would be very grateful if you explain where I mistake or propose a better solution.p  pThank you for reading thisp

Negative 74049 pI followed a Youtube video guide to make an Asteroids game with LibGdx, the person who made the video included no touchscreen controls as  they were just doing it for the desktop version.  I have managed to use the LibGdx touchpad and I have got it almost working but with a few problems when rotating the ship. p  pMy Touchpad gives values of between  pi and  pi depending on the angle Right hand side is 0, bottom is the negative values, top is positive. The same goes for the direction the ship is currently facing.p  pThe problem is that as the ship slowly rotates if your on the left side and change from pi to pi with the touchpad the ship will rotate around the long way. Every solution to this that I have come up with has caused a problem else where.

So I need to somehow get it keep rotating the correct way at all times always rotate in whichever direction will be fastest.

Negative 74049 pAre Conditional Permission Admin and User Admin services in OSGi complementary or exclusive I am developing a home automation project based on OSGi and I am not sure if I should implement both security services or not. p  pThe application will eventually be accessible through the internet but there would not be a group of user with accounts. From my understanding User Admin service is more ideal for a website or an application that will have dedicated users that need to be authenticated. In my case, the application might communicate with another application residing in different location so it might also need some form of authentication. But wouldnt the security gain by implementing Conditional Permission Admin user be enough p  pMy plan is to use the Conditional Permission Admin and create custom conditions to control special actions such us sharing resources with other bundles. Is it enough or shall I implement both. Also will having both services running affect the performance of the system significantlyp  pI would really appreciate if someone share their view on this.

Negative 74049 pI am using Entitiy Framework with Oracle and I use sequences when I need autogenerated primary key columns. When I create the edmx file EF designer doesnt recognize this pattern so I need to insert StoreGeneratedPatternIdentity to the edmx file manually for all the identitiy columns. I repeat this each time I need to update my model. When the model gets big and updates are frequent this becomes to be time consuming.p  pI wonder if there is an easier method around this, like first time I add a table to the model I can add the line StoreGeneratedPatternIdentity to the edmx, but following updates add the line automatically.p

Negative 74049 pDue to a hrefhttpllvm.orgbugsshowbug.cgiid21605 relnofollowa buga in the release version of clang, I need to compile and install it from SVN trunk. I figured I might as well also compile SVN trunk libc at the same time. I am running an up to date OS X 10.10.1, with macports installed libs and binaries where needed.p  pIve managed to compile clang and libc using the commands at the end of this post, installing them into codeHOMEusrlocalcode. Compiling my program with codeHOMEusrlocalbinclangcode works fine. However, when running the executables, the version of libc used is the system version. As seen by setting codeexport DYLDPRINTLIBRARIES1code before running it.p  pI then tried codeexport DYLDLIBRARYPATHHOMEusrlocallibcode which makes all executables use the new version of libc. However, it seems that some other executables do not like this change in which libc is being used. For example, codelscode fails with the following errorsp  precodedyld Symbol not found ZTISt9badalloc   Referenced from usrliblibutil.dylib   Expected in Usersd97sjanusrlocalliblibc.1.dylib in usrliblibutil.dylib TraceBPT trap 5 codepre  pIs this a bug in libc or dyld, or am I just crazy to believe that swapping out libc globally by setting codeDYLDLIBRARYPATHcode is feasiblep  pI emcanem make it work by running my executable with codeDYLDLIBRARYPATHHOMEusrlocallib a.outcode, but Id rather have a cleaner solution if possible.p  pAny ideas or comments of how to make it work, or rather how it should be donep  pstrongEditstrong After comment by The Paramagnetic Croissant on that its not feasible to swap out libc for other binaries [although it works for some].

Negative 74049 pI have created a clone of the app Flappy Bird, and Ive tried to add coins which appear randomly around the game. My problem is I try to make the coins disappear when the bird collides with them, but it has proven a difficult task. I have a function that spawns in a coin every 3 seconds at first all the coins had the same categoryBitMasks, but then I changed it so every 3 coins had the the categoryBitMask of 1, 2, 3, recurring. p  pI have tried many slight variations on the code to get rid of the coins as they collide with the bird, sometimes the coins will disappear, but with other problems, like the wrong coins disappearing or no more coins spawning.

Negative 74049 pIm building a web app that makes use of jquery. For example, when I press a button, all the html in a particular  on front page gets cleared and that div is populated with new contents using jquery. I want this state to be represented by a different url. I think the following will achieve the resultp  precodehistory.pushStatenull, null, newdiv codepre  pMy questions are twofoldp  ol lipThere is no resource named newdiv. The user should be able to achieve the same results as clicking the button repopulate the div when he copy pastes the ..newdiv link on another tab. Usually this gives an error 404 file not found. This should involve calling all the jquery e.t.c. Any examples as to how to do thispli lipOnce the new div is populated, the user should be able to go back to the previous state using the back button on the browser. The problem is that the original front page original div itself was created using jquery. I read the using history.popstate would achieve this. However, as I am planning to keep separate history for many such jquery calls, I cannot simply redo whatever jquery needs to be done on the original div using history.popstatepli ol  pFor examplep  precodewindow.addEventListenerpopstate, function     all the jquery needed to reproduce the original div   codepre  pis not desirable because pressing the back button from any state suppose the user have to fill in a multistage form and he presses the back button to get the previous form in my web app would result in the front page.p  pIs there any way to do these Parsing the request url in the servlet and redirecting based on that seems possible but sounds like too much work. Just wanted to check before I did something like that.p

Negative 74049 pI added nodes to a cluster which initialy used the wrong network interface as listenadress. I fixed it by changeing the listenaddress to the correct IP. The cluster is running well with that configuration but clients trying to connect to that cluster still receive the wrong IPs as Metadata from cluster. Is there any way to refresh metadata of a cluster whithout decommissioning the nodes and setting up new ones againp

This works fine for local and production server. But now I want to start using branches, and naturally need to be able to work on all branches locally. So, I need to do something different for environments, since gethostname would be the same. I figure environment variables is the best way p  pIf so, I do this in .htaccess SenEnv Or is there a better way  And what happens when i change branch I need to manually change this everytime Or, again, is there a better way p  pAny feedbacktip appreciated. Either answers to my questions, or if there are other ways entirely I should consider. p  pThanks p

Negative 74049 pI have already had a hunt through the site to see if I can find an answer but unfortunately I cannot find one  my issue is quite specific so Im hoping someone can help.p  pI have built a gallery with thumbnails which you can see at the link below. I built this from a tutorial I found online as Im not that great with Jquery yet. I had to amend the size of the large image and thumbnails from the tutorial code and since doing that it hasnt quite lined up how I would like. I amended the sizes in CSS only as instructed in the tutorial.p  pMy issue is The thumbnail block on images does not line up nicely with the bottom of the large image. It looks like it cuts off. I have checked every aspect of the CSS, which I have pasted below.p  pMany thanks in advance for taking a look.p  pa hrefhttpwww.emmasteed.co.ukrobsteedgallery.html relnofollowhttpwww.emmasteed.co.ukrobsteedgallery.htmla p  precodeslideshowmain      width714px      floatleft      marginright3px   slideshowmain ul      margin0      padding0      width714px   slideshowmain li      width714px      height351px      displaynone     positionrelative   slideshowmain li.active      displayblock important   slideshowmain li span.opacity      positionabsolute     bottom0 left0     displayblock      width100     height60px     background000     filteralphaopacity50      mozopacity0.5      khtmlopacity 0.5      opacity 0.5     zindex500   slideshowmain li span.content      positionabsolute     bottom0 left0     displayblock      width100     height60px     zindex1000   slideshowmain li span.content h1      fontsize14px     margin5px 0     padding0 10px     color42e2e8   slideshowmain li span.content p      fontsize11px     margin5px 0     padding0 10px     color42e2e8   slideshowcarousel      floatleft     width206px     height400px     positionrelative   slideshowcarousel ul      margin0      padding0     liststylenone   slideshowcarousel li      backgroundfff      height117px      positionrelative   slideshowcarousel li .arrow      left3px      top38px      positionabsolute      width20px      height40px      backgroundurlimagesarrowwhite.png norepeat 0 0      displayblock   slideshowcarousel li a      background000      displayblock      width206px      height117px    slideshowcarousel .active      filteralphaopacity100      mozopacity1.0      khtmlopacity 1.0      opacity 1.0   slideshowcarousel .faded      filteralphaopacity50      mozopacity0.5      khtmlopacity 0.5      opacity 0.5  codepre

Negative 74049 pI have a quick general question. I am currently using Netty to handle TCP and UDP packets coming from a client. I have the socket listeners each on a separate thread and it works great. p  pMy concern now is, when traffic starts hitting it heavily, I dont think a single thread for each handler to manage messages will suffice. Is it correct to generate a new thread per message I feel like its not Or should I use something like  a Threadpool for this Any advice would be greatly appreciated.p  pHere is some example code for the message handler. I wrote some pseudo code to visualize this process.

Negative 74049 pI have two threads that each sets a timerp  pcodeif threadname.equalst1 timer  new javax.swing.Timer4000,new TimerListener  else timer  new javax.swing.Timer4000,new TimerListener2code p  pbut fires it at different initial times by pressing a button.

Here is a sample code that shows what I mean.p  precodeprivate class TimerListener implements ActionListener              public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                                        tachat.appendhere 1n             try                  barrier1.await              catch InterruptedException ex                  Logger.getLoggerserverframe.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex              catch BrokenBarrierException ex                  Logger.getLoggerserverframe.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex                           tachat.appendhere 2n             ...                 codepre  pSame code with TimerListener2.The barrier is initialized in main method p  precodefinal CyclicBarrier barrier  new CyclicBarrier2 codepre  pand each thread refers to it.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavaxswingTimer.html relnofollowTimer documentationa p  blockquote   pAlthough all Timers perform their waiting using a single, shared   thread created by the first Timer object that executes, the action   event handlers for Timers execute on another thread  the   eventdispatching thread. This means that the action handlers for   Timers can safely perform operations on Swing components. However, it   also means that the handlers must execute quickly to keep the GUI   responsive.p blockquote  pIf I understand correct the handlers are going to run serialized in one thread and the above code will result to a dedlock. When I test the above code the whole gui system freezes.  My question is if there is a way to overcome this problem, or if there is an alternative way to achieve the goal I described. p

Negative 74049 pI am trying to write a Camel route to get JMX data from an ActiveMQ server through the Jolokia REST API. I was able to successfully get the JSON object from the ActiveMQ server, but I am running into an issue where I cannot figure out how to parse the JSON object in my Camel route. Camel is integrated with Jackson, Gson, and XStream, but each of those appear to require an extra library that I do not have. Camel also has support for JSONPath, but it requires another library that I do not have. All of my research so far seems to point to using a new software library, so I am looking for someone who knows a solution to possibly save me some time from trying several more dead ends.p  pThe big catch is that I am trying to parse JSON with something that comes with JavaCamelSpringActiveMQapachecommons. I would prefer a solution that only uses CamelSpring XML, but another solution using Java would work maybe JXPath with Apache Commons.p  pThe reason I am trying to use libraries that I currently have is the long process that our company has for getting new software libraries approved. I can wait several months to get a library approved or I can write my own specialized parser, but I am hoping there is some other way for me to extract some of the information from the JSON object that I am getting from the Jolokia JMX REST API in ActiveMQ.p

Negative 74049 pIm new to VB.Net, and I am curious about the use cases for extension methods.

Is there something special about extension methods that Im missing  When do you use them p

Negative 74049 pI followed a hrefhttpspring.ioguidesgsaccessingdatarest relnofollowthis examplea, which allows to post a unique codePersoncode object.

Negative 74049 pIm building a processing pipeline using TPL Dataflow. I feed items into the pipeline, and then each item moves through the pipeline independently, as it bounces from block to block, and is eventually emitted at the end. This pipeline is really more of a network, since each item can take a slightly different path through it.p  pAt some point, though, I want to display a graphical preview of each item in the UI, which should update itself as items are moving through the pipeline. For example, imagine that the items are starships, and I want to render the status of each starships shields and remaining photon torpedoes yes, I have been rewatching DS9 lately. For example, my screen might look something like thisp  precodeDefiant    72 shields, 10 Quantum Enterprise 98 shields, 25 Photon codepre  pNaturally, shields and torpedoes can be depleted independently, and it can happen for many reasons. If I have a block that handles UI rendering, it will be spammed with messages all the time, for examplep  precodeDefiant    80 shields, 12 Quantum Enterprise 100 shields, 30 Photon Defiant    79 shields, 12 Quantum Defiant    79 shields, 11 Quantum Defiant    79 shields, 10 Quantum Enterprise 98 shields, 30 Photon Enterprise 98 shields, 29 Photon ... codepre  pWhat I would like to do is make a block that aggregates all these messages by ship name. This way, when the UI block chooses to consume a message which will happen relatively rarely, it wont receive the entire combat history for each ship, but only its most recent status.p  pSo, whats the best way to write a block like that  I wrote a quick and dirty version, but Im not really happy with itp  precode   public class KeyedBroadcastBlockltTKey, Tgt         IPropagatorBlockltKeyValuePairltTKey, Tgt, KeyValuePairltTKey, Tgtgt, IReceivableSourceBlockltKeyValuePairltTKey, Tgtgt           private readonly IDictionaryltTKey, Tgt itemsMap       ...           public KeyedBroadcastBlock                 itemsMap  new DictionaryltTKey, Tgt          inputBlock  new ActionBlockltKeyValuePairltTKey,Tgtgt             kvp gt                             lock itemsMap                    bool valueExists  itemsMap.ContainsKeykvp.Key                   itemsMap[kvp.Key]  kvp.Value                   if valueExists                       midBlock.Postkvp.Key                                                                         midBlock  new ActionBlockltTKeygt             key gt                             lock itemsMap                    T value                   if itemsMap.TryGetValuekey, out value                       itemsMap.Removekey                      outputBlock.Postnew KeyValuePairltTKey, Tgtkey, value                                                          outputBlock  new BufferBlockltKeyValuePairltTKey, Tgtgt           inputBlock.Completion.ContinueWithdelegate                             midBlock.Complete                outputBlock.Complete                            public bool TryReceivePredicateltKeyValuePairltTKey, Tgtgt filter, out KeyValuePairltTKey, Tgt item                 return outputBlock.TryReceivefilter, out item               public bool TryReceiveAllout IListltKeyValuePairltTKey, Tgtgt items                 return outputBlock.TryReceiveAllout items           ...     codepre  pEDIT cleaned up the code for demonstration purposesp

Negative 74049 pstrongIs there any conventional format to represent a mathematical formula, that could be read by a computerstrongp  pIm working on some mathematical problems, and have some kind of TDD approach to it. Every time I get stuck in a proof or simply that I have no proof yet, but some intuition of what the result should be, I tend to write a little program to check that everything so far behaves as Im thinking it does. I usually write a Haskell function for some intermediary result in my proof, play with it through codeGHCicode until Im convinced Im still going in the right direction.p  pMy absolute ideal would be to have some canonical form for math formulas which I could, using some tool, both output to LaTeX and Haskell. I could run QuickTest on it, and if a step is wrong, it would tell me. LaTeXs mathematical notations are actually pretty close to a emcanonicalem form, though a lot is inferred by the reader you dont want to explicitly write strongeverystrong parentheses. p  pThis ideal tool seems too good to be true rather, what would be the correct way to spell out a mathematical formula for a computer, possibly parsing it as well While looking around, I saw a lot for simple formulas using solely codecode,codecode,codecode,codecode and the like. Nothing encompassing things like sums e.g. over sets, derivatives, all the cool stuff. Moreover, the output of such parsers are mostly used to calculate a result, giving some values for the variables not for translating it to other languages language agnostic, I guess. It seems like something like this should either already exist, or there should be a good reason why not. Which one did I missp

Negative 74049 pI was asked a question in an interview How many objects are created on the Heap in the followingp  precodeString s1 A String s2 A String s3 new StringA codepre  pI answered 1  because with the new operator only, a string object is created. When the compiler encounters s1, it will simply create A on the string literal pool. And s1 and s2 point to the same literal in the literal pool. But the interviewer confused me by saying that where does this pool existsp  pNow, in a certain blog, I readp  pIn earlier versions of Java, I think upto Java 1.6 String literal pool is located in permgen area of heap, but in Java 1.7 updates its moved to main heap area.p  pSo in this way, all the 3 string objects are created on the Heap. Isnt itp  pBut s1 and s2 point to the same literal in the string literal pools1s2 is true, so a separate object shouldnt be created when s2 is encountered. So in this manner, only 2 objects should be created.p  pCould someone clarify as such how many String objects are created on the strongHeapstrong Am I missing somethingp
