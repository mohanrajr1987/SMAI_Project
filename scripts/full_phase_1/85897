Positive 85897 pIm using the Entity Framework 6, database first Im new to EF. I have two entity classes, codeStructurecode and codeContourcode, where a codeStructurecode may contain multiple objects of type codeContourcode. I would like to be able to remove codeContourscode whether or not they already exist in the database. For example, if I add a new codeContourcode to an existing codeStructurecode object like thisp  precodeContour contour  new Contour      Structure  structure,  codepre  pI can delete it like thisp  precodecontour.Structure  null codepre  pBut if the contour already exists in the database and I delete it, saving the entity context throws the exception The relationship could not be changed because one or more of the foreignkey properties is nonnullable...p  pThat exception tells me that the entity context wasnt aware that its supposed to delete that codeContourcode. My fix was to delete a codeContourcode as followsp  precodecontour.Structure  null EntityContext.Contours.Removecontour codepre  pBut if the contour doesnt exist in the database already because it was just added, then the entity context is not aware of it and it doesnt find it in its codeContourscode list. So then I modified my delete method to thisp  precodecontour.Structure  null if EntityContext.Contours.Local.Containscontour      EntityContext.Contours.Removecontour  codepre  pThis appears to work so far, but is this how Im supposed to delete entity objects that may or may not already exist in the databasep

Since we have normalized data, the address being changed may be used in say 5 places. There are 3 workflows we could apply here.p  blockquote   ol   liSimply change the address, meaning all 5 places would be using the updated address.li   liPrompt the user, letting them know this address is used in 5 places, and have them specify if they want to change all or just this one a lot more work.li   liChange just the address for this specific account, thus meaning we have 2 different addresses persisted in the db store now, the new one, and the old one which is now used in 4 places.li   ol blockquote  pWhat is the preferred workflow and yes, I know there is no correct answer, Im wondering what is typically done p  pOnce workflow is decided, how would this be implemented. For example, take case 1 from above. To implement the change I have to do the following    p  blockquote   ol   liInstantiate an address object in code using the parameters to the method.    li   liLook in the DB to see if that address exists.           blockquote     pa. [If Exists]  get Id of existing, set Account.AddressId  foundIdbr     b. [If doesnt Exist]  use instantiated object and assign, Account.Address  newAddress, then .SaveChanges and a new address record will be entered into the database. p   blockquoteli   ol blockquote  p..seems like a lot of work, but maybe it is what it is. p  pFurthermore, what if the user just changes the zip code on the address they are changing. I need to look to see if the new one exists in the DB first, then use its id. If it doesnt exist, instantiate a new object in code. The id will be 0 so EF sets EntityState.Inserted on .SaveChanges a new record will be placed in the table. THEN... I have to look up the old one and if its not used anywhere anymore, remove it from the DB. p  p..even more work, but again, maybe it is what it is. p  pAm I missing something here, seems like things like this should be easier to do using the ORM.p

Now I either have to update the entryexit page in real time as the page views are recorded the optimal solution or run a batch update at some interval. Either way, it solves the problem, but not like Id intended. p  pEdit Edit Adding a missing index after cleaning up from last night reduced the query to mere milliseconds. Woo hoop

Negative 85897 pI have a system written in python that processes large amounts of data using plugins written by several developers with varying levels of experience.p  pBasically, the application starts several worker threads, then feeds them data. Each thread determines the plugin to use for an item and asks it to process the item. A plugin is just a python module with a specific function defined. The processing usually involves regular expressions, and should not take more than a second or so.p  pOccasionally, one of the plugins will take strongminutesstrong to complete, pegging the CPU on 100 for the whole time. This is usually caused by a suboptimal regular expression paired with a data item that exposes that inefficiency.p  pThis is where things get tricky. If I have a suspicion of who the culprit is, I can examine its code and find the problem. However, sometimes Im not so lucky.p  ul liI cant go single threaded. It would probably take emweeksem to reproduce the problem if I do. li liPutting a timer on the plugin doesnt help, because when it freezes it takes the GIL with it, and all the other plugins also take minutes to complete.li liIn case you were wondering, the a hrefhttpbugs.python.orgissue1366311SRE engine doesnt release the GILa.li liAs far as I can tell a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions760039profilinga is pretty useless when multithreading.li ul  pShort of rewriting the whole architecture into multiprocessing, any way I can find out who is eating all my CPUp  pstrongADDEDstrong In answer to some of the commentsp  ol lipProfiling multithreaded code in python is not useful because the profiler measures the total function time and not the active cpu time.

Running multithreaded allows me to go through 20,000 items in about an hour, while single threaded can take much longer theres a lot of network latency involved. There are some more complications that Id rather not get into right now. pli ol  pThat said, its not a bad idea to try to serialize the specific code that calls the plugins, so that timing of one will not affect the timing of the others.

Negative 85897 pSupposing I have a codePersoncode class that is persistedloaded via hibernatep  precodeclass   int PersonId String Name  codepre  pcodePersonIdcode is an autonumber that is generated by hibernate when saving the codePersoncode.br Now lets say I made a bunch of codePersoncodes in a test database that I now want to copy over to the Production database.brBut, in Production database, there is already a codePersonIdcode of 1 called John.br And in Test database, codePersonIdcode 1 is William.brbrHow would I import William as codePersonIdcode2 into the Production databasep  pNote that there will be other tables where codePersonIdcode is used in the Test database like Address table etc. So all of that also needs to be exportedimported, while maintaing the integrity of codePersonIdcode..p  pstrongEDITstrong I suppose one possiblilty is that the Test database should be configured to use autonumber starting at say 90,000 while we know that the Production database has values of PersonId less than 10,000. So we can split it that way. But what if the user forgot to set that and is now stuck with autonumbers starting from 1 The user shouldnt have to redo all the effort just to change the ids that my sw should ideally be doing..p

Negative 85897 pWhen the app Im working on is installed either via AdHoc thru iTunes or built directly to the device, upon launching for the first time, the only view controller in my app that responds to orientation changes doesnt receive calls to codeshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationcode with a landscape argument passed in debugging shows that its only being called for portrait.

This exact behavior can be seen in the iPhone simulator, on the iPhone and on the iPod touch.p  pSo my question is why would orientation notifications be different for the first launch of  an app than they would be for every subsequent launch Am I mistaken in believing that I have no control over orientation changes beyond responding to codeshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationcodep  pInside the ViewController in question p  pre  BOOLshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation   return YES  pre  pand inside of codeviewDidLoadcode and codeviewDidUnloadcode Ive got respectively  pre  [[UIDevice currentDevice] beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications] pre andp  pre  [[UIDevice currentDevice] endGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications] pre  pb Update July 6, 2010 bp  pStill no luck solving the problem.

When a message is published, I want the RabbitMQ cluster to send the message to either of the two queues, whichever one is up.

Negative 85897 pEdit Okay, I found a solution. Dont know that its the proper solution, but it does work correctly. Added to the code below.p  pIm trying to allow a user to select a number of directories from a checklist, and return them upon clicking a Submit button. Heres a snippet of my code. It populates the ListView with all the directories on sdcard, and for the initial selection of however many I pick when I submit, the log shows the correct choices returned. However, if I uncheck an item, and click Submit again, it still shows as if all are selected. Do I need to write a handler to uncheck an item I thought that was taken care of by the choiceMode selection Thanksp  precodeprivate SparseBooleanArray a     directoryList.setAdapternew ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis, android.R.layout.simplelistitemmultiplechoice, directoryArray     submitButton  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.submitbutton     submitButton.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener                  Override         public void onClickView v                      a  new SparseBooleanArray             a.clear             a  directoryList.getCheckedItemPositions              for int i  0 i lt a.size i                              added if statement to check for true.

Can prefuse code be manipulated to display parallel edges  Since this involves basic data level changes I believe this would be more difficult that the usual customized rendering changes.p  p2 I didnt find any reference to combined graph both directed and undirected edges in both prefuse and JUNG.

How does each framework perform while redrawing the graph  I saw in another post that prefuse does not perform well for dynamic updates a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions502763prefusetoolkitdynamicallyaddingnodesandedgesPrefuse Toolkit dynamically adding nodes and edgesa p  p6 This comes down to modifying the graph and redrawing it. So the question becomes the same as 5p  p7 Both JUNG and prefuse has multiple layout algorithms. But When I tried to display the same dataset using FruchtermanReingoldLayout in both JUNG and Prefuse I get different displays. Any ideas why  Somehow the layout algorithms in Prefuse seem to display a better layout than in JUNG rendering is also better I think though most of the layout algorithms in Prefuse are based on JUNG implementation.  Prefuse layouts such as ForceDirectedLayoutFruchtermanReingoldLayout and CircleLayout directly maps to star,circle, mesh topologies.p  pOutside of these requirements, prefuse has good support for expressions and query language but looks like it is not actively developed unlike JUNG. which one has better visualization Any suggestions on which one will be suitable and how to overcome the shortcomings    p  pAny other frameworks out there which I can use  p

Negative 85897 pThe piece of code below takes a string userstring and searches all .txt and .log files in a given directory for a match. However, Ive added two other variables userStrHEX amp userStrASCII where I convert the string to hex and ascii to search all .txt and .log files against these string formats. Currently, these variables are not being used. Im thinking to add these variables to a list, and maybe use a while loop to iterate through that section of the code up to the number of items in the list. Also, I think I will need to assign each item in the list to a static variable each time the loops is iterated ... Im stuck I would appreciate all insight.

Negative 85897 pI have a site accounts table which contains account details for all our users.p  pidusernamepasswordetcp  pWe also have a forum phpBB that Im trying to integrate with the site. The integration is done by creating an entry in the phpBB users table with the same username and password as the main account.p  pOur system uses md5 hashed passwords but the latest version of phpBB3 has a different format Phpass so I need to write a script that will replace the phpBB password with the account password for roughly 300,000 users.p  pWhat would be the best way of approaching thisp  pIve got a query that joins the two tables together based on the username, I could write something in PHP to go through each record and update it might cause performance issuesp  por do the conversion in MySQLp  pIs there another way of doing thisp  pstrongJust to clarify, when these accounts were created in both tables ... we used the same usernames and passwords for both, so each record in ourdb.accounts has the md5 hash of the same encrypted password in phpbb.users.

Negative 85897 pI am trying to optimise the compilation time of a large VC project. My processor is a Core i7 950 4 Cores, 8 Threads since it supports Intel HyperThreading Technology.p  pIn Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, if you go to ToolsOptionsProjects and SolutionsVC Project SettingsMaximum Concurrent C complilationsp  pyou can select the maximum of CPU cores to use for parallel C compilation. I select 0 there so that all my cores are used, which produces exactly the same results as when using 4 or 8.p  pNow, if I open the Task Manager whilst compiling the project, I can see that 4 parallel compilation threads are running Under processes they have the description Microsoft CC Compiler Driver, and that the total CPU usage is a bit less than 50 all the time.p  pSo my question isp  pstrongIs it possible to have 8 parallel compilation threads in a quad core, hyperthreaded processor If this is not possible, then is it possible somehow to use near 100 the processor power whilst compilingstrongp  pThis is will save me a huge amount of time.p  pThank you very much in advance,p  pNicholasp

It seems a lot of large projects have chosen it over flex, such as the streaming music service Pandora.  Im interested in why.

Negative 85897 pMy app will let users cut out things from photos. Theyll be able to either select a photo already in their iPhones photo library, or take a new one with the camera. From what I understand, UIImagePicker is the simplest way to accomplish picking a photo from the library or taking a new one. However, I also understand that it only provides basic image editing zoom, crop. I want my image editing to allow for the creation of Bezier curves that, once all joined together, will cut out the enclosed area, saving it without the surrounding background.p  pThe official apple documentation on UIImagePicker suggested that the AV Framework is required for providing custom image editing as opposed to the basic zoom and crop. So my first questions arep  ol lipIs the AV Framework indeed what I want to usepli lipWill it get used in conjunction with UIImagePicker i.e., UIImagePicker is used to select the photo or take a new one, and then my AV Framework code takes over for the image editingpli lipCan anyone offer good resources on getting started on learning the code for this processpli ol  pMy final question is about the actual Bezier curve generationmanipulation. It appears that the Core Graphics Framework has support for this, but there is also the UIBezierPath object, which is apparently some kind of wrapper for the Core Graphics tools I would otherwise use.p  pSo my final question will I want to use the UIBezierPath object, or does what I previously described require more finegrained control that UIBezierPath cant provide, thereby forcing me to use the Core Graphics framework directlyp  pThanksp
Negative 85897 pI am using a code.batcode file to automate some tasks for my engine once it is freshly cloned from the repository. One of the tasks is setting the environment variables. I am using the codeSETXcode command and set the path of the named variable to be codeCDcode, i.e. the directory the installer was run from. p  pThis works well, although the user needs to codelogofflogoncode which may be annoying. This codelogofflogoncode cycle is not required if the variable is set as the system variable I am not sure why but restarting Visual Studio has no effect on user environment variables... that is, it detects no changes but it will detect changes in system variables. So I proceeded to use the codemcode command. Unfortunately, that requires that the batch file has admin privileges. Not a problem I ran the batch file as administrator. Well, emnowem I ran into a problem. The current directory variable, codeCDcode changed from the directory the installer was run from, to codeCWindowsSystem32code. p  pSo now onto the question. strongHow do I set system environment variables via a batch file which utilizes codeCDcode without it defaulting to codeCWindowsSystem32codestrong. Just as a note, quite a few people use the installer and I would like this process to be as painless and mistakes free as possible. Which means, no manual entry is preferred. Currently, if run without admin privileges and without codemcode, the only thing needed is a codelogofflogoncode cycle. Otherwise, everything is automated. p

How these are segregated from yesterdays orders or todays orders, or orders after printing todays orders doesnt matter. It could be by LAST credential number, or by datetime cutoff, or whatever. Its negligable as long as there is not duplicates.p  pThings I would like to see is the ability for the user to preview their credential prior to submission  JQuery would most likely fit the bill, I envisioned updating the preview image from the input fields,  the ability to use a filter array or list could be a flatfile so we can remove banned words, and lastly so we can correct mistakes even the the user makes them, a way to edit the PDFs, either direclty through  a tool.p  pIve been looking around for a plugin or module for the last week that I could at least get a starting point on to do this.

Negative 85897 pSome friends and I are part of a large student group and we are trying to create an online web form to help automate and organize monetary reimbursements. We want to be able to have users authenticate preferably with their google accounts and submit the data through online form that passes it to a SQL server. Ultimately, we want to be able to export the data as a CSV file to be imported into Quickbooks. p  pMost of my group are not experienced programmers so weve been learning on the go. Right now, we already have a SQL server set up in the back end. Weve been pulling PHP code from online examples to create our web submission form. Ive posted some of the code of what we have so far a hrefhttppastebin.comzBGnt4Hf relnofollowhttppastebin.comzBGnt4Hfa  As for authentication, we were planning on using a user management platform like Janrain to log in with our google accounts via OpenID.p  pRight now, another student recommended for us to consider using Ruby on Rails over PHP. From searching online and from talking to friends, it sounds like itll be easier to hack together something using PHP, but Ruby would allow us to create a more streamlined system esp if were using a Ruby on Railsbased web framework for the site. I wanted to post here on Reddit to get some advice or thoughts for you guys, since you all have much more experience with web development then I do. How is our approach Should we switch to Ruby or is there another way thats a lot easier that were completely overlookingp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 85897 pI had with an issue that has plagued me for days. It turned out that it was an Android glitch and has been submitted, confirmed, and hopefully will be fixed in a future release. Now I have found a solution that works for me, and will provide it below, however the solution is not perfect as it involves editing the phone gap source. Mainly my question is if someone can find a better solution to this issue. p  pThe Bugbr There is a glitch when you attempt to load a page inside of a WebView on Android 3.0. The glitch is that if that page references any local javascript files, you cannot append query data to the url. Basically p  pThis worksbr codeltscript typetextjavascript srcStaticJS.jsgtltscriptgtcodep  pThis does not workbr codeltscript typetextjavascript srcStaticJS.jsvarvalgtltscriptgtcodep  pWhy the hell would anyone want to do this since the file obviously cant do anything with the query vals Well for me I have a phonegap application that loads a settings file via JSONP, however if a settings file is not specified it defaults to a local file. So yeah, the file cant process the query data but it would be nice to use the same file format and loading structure.p  hr  h1Solution 1 NonPhoneGaph1   pSo there is an easy solution to this if the target android platform is 11Honeycomb or higher. As long as you are careful and do not use any method that do not exists in any lower API levels this code will run on lt11 apis, but you will still have to set 11 as your targetp  pBasically you add a WebViewClient to the WebView that utilizes the shouldInterceptRequest method to intercept the loading of local js files with query data attached. p  precodeimport java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStream  import android.content.res.AssetManager import android.webkit.WebResourceResponse import android.webkit.WebView import android.webkit.WebViewClient  public class PatchingWebViewClient extends WebViewClient      AssetManager am      public PatchingWebViewClientAssetManager am         this.am  am           Override     public WebResourceResponse shouldInterceptRequest WebView view, String url         ifurl.indexOffileandroidasset  0 ampamp url.contains             String filePath  url.substring22, url.length             filePath  filePath.substring0, filePath.indexOf             try                  InputStream is  am.openfilePath                 WebResourceResponse wr  new WebResourceResponsetextjavascript, UTF8, is                 return wr              catch IOException e                  return null                      else             return null                 codepre  pTo set the WebViewClient, your code would look something like thisp  precodeimport android.app.Activity import android.os.Bundle import android.webkit.WebView  public class CanWeBreakAWebViewActivity extends Activity      WebView mWebView      Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.main          mWebView  WebView findViewByIdR.id.webview         mWebView.getSettings.setJavaScriptEnabledtrue         mWebView.setWebViewClientnew PatchingWebViewClientthis.getAssets         mWebView.loadUrlfileandroidassetindex.html       codepre  hr  h1Solution 2 PhoneGaph1  pNow for Phonegap I dont have a clean solution. My solution is to go and download the Phonegap source and edit the CordovaWebViewClient by adding the following methodp  precodeOverride public WebResourceResponse shouldInterceptRequest WebView view, String url     ifurl.indexOffileandroidasset  0 ampamp url.contains         String filePath  url.substring22, url.length         filePath  filePath.substring0, filePath.indexOf         try              InputStream is  ctx.getAssets.openfilePath             WebResourceResponse wr  new WebResourceResponsetextjavascript, Cp1252, is             return wr          catch IOException e              return null              else         return null       codepre  hr  h1Solution 3 NonExistenth1  pThis solution would hopefully be some easy to include class or tweak to the main activity so that you can use phone gap but could just use a .jar file of the code, making upgrades easier. p

Negative 85897 pI am attempting to write a service, that will every X minutes attempt to get the GPS location of the device, and run and record in the background even when the app is not in focuse.p  pSo, time to create a service.p  pI created a service, set up the locationListener, got the location Manager and requestLocationUpdates... all is good with the world.. rudimentary skeleton working.p  pNow, I dont want the GPS running constantly as this will kill the battery, what I would like to happen is the service, fire up the GPS, ask for an update, then shut down at least its interest in the gps location and then 5 or 10 minutes later do this again..p  pSimple enough, on the onLocationChanged method of my listener, I add the line LocationManager removeUpdateslocationListener.. so when my service asks for an update, it gets only one, and shuts down.p  pI decide to add a little while loop, that effectively registers my location listener, and sleeps for X minutes.  So logically, it should register that it wants information, then sleep.. an update comes in, I get that update in the onLocationChange and it unregisteres its intereste in the event, shutting down the GPS until the next execution of the loop.p  pNow, I have 2 questions 1 Does this logically seem okay  or is there a more elegant way  Remember I want this to record information whether or not the launching application is in focus, and honestly even if the launching app was killed would like the service to continue running potentially but thats a design decision I havent fully made yet. p  pThe 2nd question is, I will need to put this LOOP inside a thread since having it in the oncreate, causes the service to eventually be killed because its taking too long to come back from oncreate, so what would be the best way to go about doing this  AsyncTask is an option, but this is a task that is never in theory going to finish.. Handler also seems sort of silly, as there are no real callbacks, its just registering for the GPS updates, and the uninterest code is in the LocationListener onLocationChange.p  pThere is no real communication that would come out of this thread once instantiated, though it would need to be signaled to dieend when the service is going to be shut down by some user interaction to do so... p  pSo should I just just use a base thread  Go with an AsyncTask even though its never really coming back or is using the Handler the better option  Or is my model just complete bad form out of the gatep

Negative 85897 pIm having a time issue with looping through like 1 million potential rows from a database. I basically pull the rows into a DataTable and loop through them, but it is getting slow. What is the alternative out there I can split this rows into chunks like 20,000 a piece. Can I use parallel processing in C Basically the code loops through every potential record that matches a certain query and tries to figure out if it is a legitimate entry. That is why every record needs to be individually visited. A record for a one object could reach 10 million rows. Approaches seem like parallel processing in multiple computers or PP in single machine with multiple cores, or some kind of data structureapproach changep  pAny opinions, thoughts and guesses are helpful to make this fast and reasonablep

This metadata will be added to data in the files and passed on to the later mapcombinereduce stages. p  pI was wondering where the correct place to put this query might be. I need the metadata to be available when the mapper begins, but placing it there seems redundant, as every Mapper will execute the same query. How can I if at all perform this query once and share its results across all the mappers Is there a common way to share data between all the nodes performing a task other than writing it to HDFS thanks.p

Negative 85897 pHere is how the application is designed   I have a COM server raising events on certain conditions.  I have a C client UI which is supposed to handle these events raised by this COM server. p  pThere is a delegate in my C client which I pass to the COM server and it calls back on an event. I have a custom wrapper which marshals the delegate as function pointer. Like so...p  precode     Fxn1inCOMWrapper[In, MarshalAsUnmanagedType.FunctionPtr] Client.SetStatusDelegate StatusCallback codepre  pThe callback mechanism works.  The problem here is that once I get the callback, I am supposed to call another method in the COM Server to invoke further processing. p  pI am not able to make the second function call to COM component from the C callback method, and it corrupts the stack in COM and it returns me an exception.  I am guessing it is the case because the callback is not the same thread on which the COM object was created and the first call was made. Is it possible to work around this problemp  pOne option was to set a flag in event callback in C client.  And on a timer from the main thread, check for the flag and if yes, make the second call. But there surely has to be a more elegant way of doing this...Can anyone help pleasep

Negative 85897 pIve been pondering this for a couple hours and Im a little surprised at how challenging it is. Im trying to initialize a static cache of reflection data for a given object from a base class that will be accessed from multiple threads. Im having a hard time coming up with the correct pattern for initializing the cache.p  pMy first thought was that Ill just initialize the static cache to null, check if its null in the constructor, and then build and set it if its not. I.e.p  precodeclass TestBase    private static ConcurrentDictionaryltstring, PropertyInfogt Cache    protected TestBase        ifCache  null            ConcurrentDictionaryltstring, PropertyInfogt cache          new ConcurrentDictionaryltstring, PropertyInfogt        Populate...       Cache  cache          codepre  pThis has a flaw in that if I construct another object while the first one is still populating the cache, Ill end up constructing two caches and the second will presumably, though not always overwrite the first. This is probably okay since theyll both be complete caches, but it seems hacky and I would hope we can do better.p  pSo my second thought was to initialize the cache in a static constructor which only gets called once per AppDomain before any instances are created. StackOverflow seems to have several answers to similar questions that point in this direction. This seemed great until I realized that the static constructor wont have access to the reflection data for the derived type.p  pI could always synchronize access in the constructor to insure only one thread is creatingpopulating the cache and any other access while thats happening should block, but then Im locking on every construction just to protect an operation that should only happen once. I dont like the performance implications of that.p  pWhat I have right now is a flag that is set using Interlocked.Exchange and a ManualResetEventSlim. It looks like thisp  precodeclass TestBase    private static ConcurrentDictionaryltstring, PropertyInfogt Cache   private static volatile int BuildingCache  0   private static ManualResetEventSlim CacheBuilt      new ManualResetEventSlim    protected TestBase        ifInterlocked.Exchangeref BuildingCache, 1  0            Cache  new ConcurrentDictionaryltstring, PropertyInfogt        Populate...       CacheBuilt.Set          CacheBuilt.Wait     codepre  pI suspect that there might already be an accepted, or at least known, way of doing this kind of thing  is this it If not, is there a better way to synchronize the cache initialization Note that the question is not about how to make cache access threadsafe, that can be assumed by using ConcurrentDictionary or similar.p

Negative 85897 pI started learning programming about 8 months ago, started with C, OOP, now onto iOS, which is my goal.  Everything is going pretty smooth for the most part and Ive started to practice by programming small applications on xcode.  Its just little terms like subroutine that sometimes throw me off.  Can anyone define this term for me and just give me a quick example of its usage  I know it is some type of method, and I completely understand instance and class methods, however I dont know exactly what the difference between a subroutine and an instanceclass method is.  Ive looked online but not much luck.p  pAny help is appreciated, thanksp
Negative 85897 pI have a chart, and I have a tree view with nodes that when selected bring up various charts.  The tree view nodes are named xxxChart, and the methods that bring up the various charts are named xxxChart after whichever node that calls it.p  pThere are parameters that can be changed startend date for example and when that happens I need to run the method for the current chart again to refresh it with the updated parameter selection.  I thought it would be a good idea to have an Action object called DisplayChart that would be set whenever a node is selected.  Then when a parameter is changed I just call DisplayChart.p  pNow, I welcome any ideas you may have for better patterns to solve this problem but my question is this  How can I use reflection to get something I can assign to the Action object  I know how to invoke a method using reflection, but when a node is selected I just want to store the method with the name matching that node in the DisplayChart Action object.p  pOf course, I know I could just use a MethodInfo object instead of an Action object and then use reflection to invoke the method, but Im still curious how to do it this way.p

Negative 85897 pI am attempting to hook an application and drive the mouse via WMTOUCH events. In order to do this I have hooked WHGETMESSAGE and am able to successfully receive WMTOUCH events. After receiving the touch events, I then make calls to sendInput to produce the desired mouse functionality however, the moment I make the mouse calls via sendInput I stop receiving WMTOUCH events.p  pI thought this was due to the placement of my sendinput calls however, after taking out all calls to sendInput, I was able to confirm using Spy that any input from the mouse that is, me physically moving the mouse, resulted in the interruption of  the WMTOUCH events.p  pLastly, I created a WPF application which contained simple callbacks on the for all touch events. I can put my finger on the form and receive events however, the moment I move the physical mouse, the WPF program receives a TouchUp event followed by TouchLeave event, even though my finger is still moving on the touch screen.p  pI was hoping that someone would be able to shed some light on why this is happening and if it is possible for me to produce my desired functionality.p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 85897 pHad a question about what best practice might be for the implementation of convenience queries.  In reference to this articlep  pa hrefhttpwww.jasongrimes.org201201usingdoctrine2inzendframework2tocinstalldoctrinemodules relnofollowhttpwww.jasongrimes.org201201usingdoctrine2inzendframework2tocinstalldoctrinemodulesap  pIts clear that the entity manager is available in the IndexController  he does a findAll to list the entire contents of the database.  What if, however, we added a band column to the database, mapped it out, and wanted to query all albums by the Beatles  What if the Beatles albums were used rather often throughout the codebase weak example, but you get it.p  pThe EM only seems to be available in Controllers, and Classes dont really seem to be aware of the service locator.  p  ul liWould you simply break out DQL right in the controller, and repeat the DQL in every controller that needs it not very DRY li liDo we instead finagle some access to the EM from the Entity, or Modelli ul  pDoesnt seem as cutanddry as straight ZendDb usage where you can fire queries anywhere you like, cheating to get things done.p  pThanks for helping me cross over into a real ORM from the Table Gateway world.p
Negative 85897 pWhen I go to browse packages in Sublime Text 2, the packages folder is full of all the plugins I wanted like Zen coding and SidebarEnhancements. br My installed packages folder only has package control in it though. Should other installed packages be located in here p  pSidebarEnhancements, for example, does not work, even though it is in the packages folder. If I right click the sidebar I just get the close option. Ive been trying to figure this out for weeks, and I figured I would just ask here and see if anyone could tell me what I need to do after I have the package in the packages folder, if anything.p

Negative 85897 pI am writing an application that requires scanning in .net codeccode version code4.0code, Visual Studio 2010.  Im using the codeTWAINcode API in order to do the scanning and I have a problem with the layout feature.  The following code works perfectly fine on a codeMicrotek i800code, a codeCanoScan 9000Fcode and a codeMicrotek Artix Scan F2code but when I run it against an a hrefhttpwww.epson.comcgibinStorejspProduct.doskuB11B178011 relnofollowEpson Perfection V700a something really strange occurs.p  pEven though I am setting the left margin of the layout to code0code the left edge of the image is cut off.  I tried setting it to negative values but that made no difference.  It seems like there is some strangeness and it is forcing it to be a film size perhaps because I am turning the light on.  If I use the tool that comes with the scanner it allows me to select a region that includes both edges and have the light on so it must be possible.  Also, the top and bottom coordinates work perfectly fine.p  pSo my question is...p  blockquote   pDoes anyone know of any way I can make it scan the entire width  Is there some other setting in TWAIN that I can set first to get it to forget its paper sizes perhaps  I tried setting PaperDetectable to false too but it made no difference.p blockquote  pOne other thing  emIf I do not set the layout, it still cuts off the picture on the edges just not top and bottom but if I also do not set the light on or I do not set the light on but I do set the size it does what I would expect specifically scans the entire picture from the left most edge but the problem is, I really need the light and the entire width of the scan  surely that isnt too much to ask....emp  hr  pHere is the code it is the

Negative 85897 pHi,br Ive got some Spinner objects that, when selected, change the contents of an codeEditTextcode and a Button. All is working fine until I toggle the screen on and off.br  I made the application orientation landscapeonly and thus on toggling the screen on and off causes the activity to be destroyed.p  pThe problem that occurs here is that I lose all the state information of the Spinner, EditText and Button objects.br So I tried to solve this problem with the codeonSaveInstanceStatecode and codeonRestoreInstanceStatecode methods, by setting back the state of the Spinner, Button and EditText in that order.br The problem is that, for some reason, the codeonItemSelectedcode method is called after I restored the state of the Button and EditText, and thus they are set to their default values.br I tried disabling the onItemSelected listeners temporarily, but as soon as I enabled them again, the onItemSelected method is called and resets the Button and EditText state.p  pNote I only want to restore the state after the app has been killed by the system, not by the user. p

Negative 85897 pI have a simple data file. Each line in the file has four elements. Some lines are filled with no blank entries. Other lines have a first entry and the remaining three are blank, or rather filled with a space. It is a tab delimited file. p  pExample of the input filep  precode    .     .     .     30  13387412    34.80391242 sSNFIRST     30  13387412    34.80391242 sSN540     30.1                  30.2                  30.3                  30.4                  31  14740248    65.60590089 s3213822344     31  14740248    65.60590089 s321382LAST     .     .     . codepre  pTo reiterate, the blanks in my file actually contain a single space, if this matters.p  pMy overall goal is to fill in the second and third column the fourth column is ignored throughout the file. In order to do that, I need my script to identify sets of consecutive lines that are blank, plus the line immediately preceding and the line immediately succeeding the set of consecutive blank lines. In the example above, this would be lines 2  7. Once I can do that, I can use the information in the flanking lines, which are filled, to help fill in the missing entries in the lines in between.p  pI have been experimenting with the codeuntilcode function, but Im not succeeding in coupling it with a loop that reads the data line for line.

I even tried with a base Cordova template.p  pSo, when I debug my application from VS2012, the emulator starts and the application deploys. I know that I cant use LOCALHOST, so my script reference is to the IP address of my computer or server. The apps starts, and I can go to the Weinre console and I see that I have a connection.

Negative 85897 pIve recently started targeting API level 14 with my Android JNI application, and immediately discovered problems described a hrefhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.com201111jnilocalreferencechangesinics.html relnofollowherea.p  pFailing to solve the problem by explicitly managing local references got local ref table overflow in the end of my experiments, Ive decided to simply switch to global refs. Now Im getting attempt to use stale global reference problem that isnt described in that article. p  pHeres what Im trying to do theres a single object that has a container of codejobjectcodes. Whenever Java calls my native method and passes a reference I need to store for later use, I create new global ref to that codejobjectcode, add global ref to the container and also store its index. Whenever I need to use the codejobjectcode I get it by index. What is the problem with this approachp  pP. S. Whenever I call JNI methods, I am using correct codeJNIEnvcode for the calling thread. The thread making JNI calls is attached to JVM.p

Negative 85897 pI asked this question elsewhere. But I would ask it here too in case who knows the answer.p  pI recently wrote a simple web app. It has two views in total, and users should be able to go back and forward between the two views. It seems nature to me that setView method can the job of changing the app view. It works all good when switching from Index view to Show view by clicking a link. However, it cannot go back to Index view when I click a link. It just pops up this error message Please set Viewmanage property with selector  to true. Since the old view objects should have been destroy when switching to another view, why it would have this error unless its not working as I thought it would be.p  pBelow is a snippet of my coffeescript code.         MyApp.Routers.Home  Backbone.Router.extend           routes             books  showBooksIndex             booksid  showBookp  precode      initialize options gt         buildLayout        buildLayout gt         layout  app.useLayoutmain        showBooksIndex gt         cleanLayout         books  new MyApp.Collections.Book         viewIndex  new MyApp.Views.BooksIndex             collection books                  layout.setViewapp, viewIndex        showBook id gt         cleanLayout         book  new MyApp.Models.Book id id         view  new MyApp.Views.BookShow model book         layout.setViewapp, view        cleanLayout gt         appView  layout.getViewapp         if appView           appView.remove      MyApp.Views.BookShow  Backbone.View.extend       id bookshow       className bookcard       manage true       template JST[templatesbooksshow]       initialize gt         model  options.model         this           model.fetch           success model, respgt             this.render            codepre  pMyApp.Views.BooksIndex is has similar code to BookShow view.p  pCaching the views is probably a solution too. This approach will work around this issue because recreation of view objects is avoided. But since my app have lots of photos, I would prefer to fetch data from server every time the app view changes. I am not sure if it is the right way to go.

My issue was being caused by ESET NOD32 messing with the http traffic from devenv.exe and causing all the ports in my computer to get used up, however.br Anyway, as soon as that was finished, I opened my website back up, and clicked debug. Asp.Net Dev server pops up, which was what the hotfix was supposed to make happen, and then notepad opens with the tabs I had last time I used it, and IE never shows up.

Always notepad, never IE, always with no new documents opened, just some completely unrelated stuff.br Ive seen one other post on SO about this happening, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12968836visualstudioisopeningwebpageinnotepadherea, but his issue was corrupted filesfilesystem.

Still opens notepad, so thats not my issue.br Ive also tried rebuilding, which did nothing, and deleting my local Solution files, which also did nothing. I restarted the program and then the computer, both to no avail.br I start to believe that this is the hotfix screwing things up, so I try to do a system restore to a couple days ago. Once again, no dice its still pulling up notepad instead of IE.brbrp  pSo, the questions becomebr Is there a setting or two I can try changing to make it open the proper program againbr Or was this a badimproper hotfix, and if so, how do I uninstall it It doesnt show up in the AddRemove Programs dialog, and I dont see an option to uninstall it in VS, or in the installer.p  pThanks in advance.p  p[edit] Also note Notepad is not actually opening the website file, its just getting opened with whatever I left in it last time.

Negative 85897 pIve been working on a rewrite of my model layer to use across several existing apps.  The existing codebase is dated and Id like to generalize my approach to lend to easier extension in the future and get the benefits of more recent language  technology additions ARC for one.  p  pMy goal is a portable, SQLbacked framework consisting of a simple database layer built on top of FMDatabase and robust model object class which together encapsulate most of the complexity.  Model objects subclass from the main superclass and abide by a contract to implement and override methods that provide necessary property and schema details to facilitate SQL actions.p  pIve used this approach with much success in PHP but have run into issues with ObjectiveC.  p  pYes, CoreData provides these things but is not an option for a number of reasons.  Ive also seen solutions that solve the problem at runtime but Im not sure that would work with ARC, and would prefer to generate the accessors prior to compilation.p  pI started with the debate of maintaining a lock based pattern for multithreaded access vs a GCD based approach a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15857581multithreadedobjectivecaccessorsgcdvslocks15858078question raised herea and have ended up with the following patternp  precode NSDate creationDate      block NSDate aDate     dispatchsyncaccessorQueue,          aDate  creationDate          return aDate    voidsetCreationDateNSDate aDate      if [aDate isKindOfClass [NSDate class]]          NSLogsetCreationDate called with nondate object         return           dispatchbarrierasyncaccessorQueue,          if creationDate ampamp aDate  [aDate isEqualToDate creationDate]              [self willChangeValueForKey creationDate]              [changes setObject aDate  aDate  [NSNull null]                         forKey creationDate]              creationDate  aDate              [self didChangeValueForKey creationDate]                codepre  pI like it but I want to be able to generate for a list of properties to simplify the model object code.  My first step would be to create macro expansion to build the accessorsmutators.  Here Ive already run into lessthanperfect options though.p  p1 Iterating on lists in macros is an ugly process.  Boost.preprocessor may be an option but considering 2 amp 3 it kind of scares me.p  p2 Macros need to be passed in all possible versions of the tokens used ie. Id have to pass in creationDate and CreationDate just to satisfy generating the getter and setter for the example above.  Not a showstopper but not ideal either. p  p3 A different macro expansion is needed for object and primitive types which makes iterating  over a list of properties 1 even more difficult.  I could pass in the expansion macro for each property in the list but this time saver is now looking like quite the opposite a long list of tuples is not much more readable than a list of individual calls to macros.p  pIm hoping Ive overlooked something that makes this possible or perhaps someone has already built a drop in solution that I havent found.  Maybe a preprocessing script to generate categories containing the accessors...  I havent looked into that option yet but would be ok with it, especially if it extended to other languages for crossplatform targeting.p  pAdvice appreciated.p

Negative 85897 pFirst of all, I know there are a lot of similar posts on here, but Ive been looking through them in for a while and I am having trouble deciphering exactly what I need to do.  So on to my problem  I am converting a Graph class I previously wrote in C to C.  I am having trouble converting arrays to vectors due to how I initialize it.

The List is a class that I also wrote, which deals with nodes.  I just have all of these C arrays that I need converted to C vectors, and the syntax is killing me.

Easy dereferencing with pointer to elementh3  pOn the other hand it would be possible to have a pointer codepcode matrix valuetype element pointer and some control values to control iterator advancement. In the vertical part 2  7  11 referring to the example above the pointer needs to advance 54 and in the horizontal part 11  12  13  14 the codepointercode needs to change by 111. This is not trivial but also not very difficult and can be solved in an algebraic fashion without iteration.p  pDereferencingelement access is no long associated with any calculation since codepcode can be used. This is how I currently do it.p  h2The questionh2  pWhere should I have the computational work and which way would you go and whyp  pI can either havep  ul lisimple and fast iterator advancement but demanding element access orli lidemanding advancement but simple and fast element access.li ul  pI tend to the second since the iterator will most likely advance only once per cycle in a loop, whereas it may be dereferenced multiple times.p

Negative 85897 pIm trying to figure out how to implement version control in an environment where we have two DBs one emTestingem and one emProductionem. p  pIn emTestingem. there are an arbitrary number of tasks being tested. These have no constraints in number of objects manipulated and complexity, meaning we can have a 3day task that changes 2 package bodys and one trigger, and we can have a 3 month task that changes 100 different objects, including  source files and binary objects.p  pMy main concern are the textbased objects of the DB. We need to version the emTestem and emProductionem code, but any task can go from emTestingem to emProductionem with no defined order whatsoever.p  pThis means right now we have to manually track the changes in the files, selecting inside each file which lines in the code go from emTestingem to emProductionem. We use a very rudimentary solution, writing in the header a sequence of comments with a filebased version number and adding in the code tags with that sequence to delimit the change.p  pIm struggling to implement SVN because I wanted to create emTestingem as a branch of emProductionem, having branches in emTestingem to limit each task, but I find that it can lead to many emTestingem tasks being ported to emProductionem during merges.p  pThis said, my questions arep  ul liIs there a way to resolve this automatically   li liAre there any databasespecific version control solutions   li liHow can I link both environments if the code base is so different   li ul

When finished, a contact has to be mailed with a survey in which he gives feedback on how the project went. p  pThe software has a projectclass. Theres a procedure which loops through all projects.  I have split off all code for mailing to a class called ContactMailer, which takes the project as a parameter, something like ContactMailer.AttemptMailprojectp  pBut there are certain conditions in which a mail is NOT to be sent the project is marked DoNotSurvey, or marked Challenged  someone disputes that a mail should not be sent and an admin has to decide over this, and if there is no valid survey for this kind of project. p  pMy question is this check could be in a procedure like CheckMailConditions or something like that, but where does this procedure belong Should it be in de ContactMailer That feels somewhat off, although it IS a check if a mail should be sent. Or should it be a separate class That sounds like SRP a class that has one responsibility check conditions but this would lead to one class with one method, which seems overkill.p  pOr should I check these conditions even before calling ContactMailer.AttemptMail, since they are properties of the project Im kind of lost.p  pThanks in advance for your thoughtsp

Negative 85897 pSo I have a new requirement that is tricky to me and Im unable to figure out so far. I am using a gridview to insert, and update data. One of the requirements that I have is when a user manually adds a new record, if the same deal number exists then display a pop up. This pop up should show the record that already exists. They should be able to click 1 of 3 buttons which are use, discard, or Ok. The use button will basically close the pop up and clear the textboxes the user was entering in. The discard button must delete the record that exists so the user can insert the new record using that same deal number. The reason for this is because the deal number is the most unique number for the deals that occur. With the way we are exporting from an old application to a new one, duplicates are downloaded, sometimes some with more information than the first time it was exported. This is why I must add a requirement for the user to choose which record for them to keep. I hope this makes sense to you all. I have dried a few things, but this is what I currently have and Im stuck on. p  pThe Jquery Scriptp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction           function showpopup              popup.dialogopen                   popup.dialog             modal true,             width 450,             autoOpen false,             open function type, data                  this.parent.appendToform                                popup.eachfunction               var popup  this             popup.parent.appendToformfirst               ltscriptgt codepre  pAnd now the division the script calls which has another gridview to display the existing record..p  precodeltdiv classpopUpStyle titleDuplicate Deal Found idpopup styledisplaynonegt             ltaspGridView IDgvDealTracking runatserver Width200px AutoGenerateColumnsFalsegt                 ltColumnsgt                     ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextStock gt                         ltItemTemplategt                             ltaspLabel IDlblDupStockNumber runatserver Textlt BindStockNumber gtgtltaspLabelgt                         ltItemTemplategt                     ltaspTemplateFieldgt                     ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextDeal gt                         ltItemTemplategt                             ltaspLabel IDlblDupDealNumber runatserver Textlt BindFIMAST gtgtltaspLabelgt                         ltItemTemplategt                     ltaspTemplateFieldgt                     ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextDealDategt                         ltItemTemplategt                             ltaspLabel IDlblDupDealDate runatserver Textlt BindDealDate gtgtltaspLabelgt                         ltItemTemplategt                     ltaspTemplateFieldgt                     ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextBuyergt                         ltItemTemplategt                             ltaspLabel IDlblDupBuyer runatserver Textlt BindBuyer gtgtltaspLabelgt                         ltItemTemplategt                     ltaspTemplateFieldgt                     ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextGrossProfitgt                         ltItemTemplategt                             ltaspLabel IDlblDupGrossProfit runatserver Textlt BindGrossProfit gtgtltaspLabelgt                         ltItemTemplategt                     ltaspTemplateFieldgt                     ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextAmtFinancedgt                         ltItemTemplategt                             ltaspLabel IDlblDupAmtFinanced runatserver Textlt BindAmtFinanced gtgtltaspLabelgt                         ltItemTemplategt                     ltaspTemplateFieldgt                     ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextBankNamegt                         ltItemTemplategt                             ltaspLabel IDlblDupBankName runatserver Textlt BindBankName gtgtltaspLabelgt                         ltItemTemplategt                     ltaspTemplateFieldgt                 ltColumnsgt             ltaspGridViewgt             ltbr gt             ltaspButton IDbtnUse TextUse runatservergtltaspButtongt             ltaspButton IDbtnDiscard TextDiscard runatserver OnClickbtnDiscardClick styledisplaynonegtltaspButtongt             ltaspLabel IDlblMessagePop runatservergtltaspLabelgt             ltbr gt         ltdivgt codepre  pAnd now the code behind that I use to try to delete the existing record..p  precode protected void btnDiscardClickobject sender, EventArgs e                      try                              GridViewRow gvr  GridViewRowsender as Control.Parent.Parent                 string dealnumber  Labelgvr.FindControllblDupDealNumber.Text.Trim                  conn.Open                 SqlCommand cmdDeleteDup  new SqlCommandDELETE  FROM Vehicle WHERE FIMAST  FIMAST, conn                 cmdDeleteDup.Parameters.AddWithValueFIMAST, dealnumber                 cmdDeleteDup.ExecuteNonQuery                 conn.Close                           catch Exception ex                              lblMessagePop.Text  ex.ToString                       codepre  pThe button click isnt not firing and I do now know how to make it work.

Negative 85897 pWe have an app that integrated the facebook login, recently we had received an email from Facebook stating the followingp  p1. Your Android or iOS app does not use our native SDKs to initiate Facebook Login.

Note that starting October 2, using our native SDKs for login will be required by Facebook Platform Policy I.3. For more information on this, visita hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginusingsdks relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginusingsdksap  pBut the fact is, our app uses the following for loginp  precodesession openWithBehaviorFBSessionLoginBehaviorForcingWebView codepre  pWhich obviously is a function PROVIDED WITHIN Facebooks SDKp  pAnd also the app does not require the user to relog in if heshe is already logged in.

For instance, if I set a user variablep  precoderequest.getSessiontrue.setAttributeuser, user Redirects to another html page or something... codepre  pWhen the client makes another request and I attempt to access the user session variable it returns null.p  precodeClient makes another request to the server request.getSessiontrue.getAttributeuser returns null codepre  pIve noticed that on each request, a new JSESSIONID cookie is set and the ID value changes. Does this mean that a new session is being created each time the client accesses the server How do I maintain the same session between the client so I can store objects in the HttpSession and have access to themp  pI dont know if this  has anything to do with anything either, but when viewing the application from the tomcat manager, the sessions count continues to grow regardless of the fact that I am using the application from the same browser window, not refreshing the page or anything. Another sign that a new session is being created on each request to the serverp  pThis only happens when accessing the application from a domain name ex example.comapp. When coming from localhost, the session variables work fine.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI tested without using response.sendRedirect and the session variable is available until I switch pages and make another request to the server. This confirms my suspicions that a new session is being created with each request. Its not the redirect thats killing the session, its any new request. How do I prevent thisp

Negative 85897 pI got a Viewpager with three tabs. One of tabsfragments actually contains codeEditTextcode. Heres the problem When I swipe to that fragment when it is in focus I want to show keyboard and when I swipe to next tab I want to hide keyboard. Problem is that in codeViewPagercode, fragment is destroyed only after i swipe to the third fragment, what means that keyboard stays open when a fragment without codeEditTextcode is in focus. And another problem is that, when I swipe from third fragment to second which, I repeat, dont have codeEditTextcode control keyboard shows because codeViewPagercode instantiate two fragments in a row. I hope that Im clear enough, if not I will try to explain it. Is there some way to instantiate fragment in codeViewPagercode only when he comes in focus and save his state when its focused Thanks...p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHere is my adapterp  precodepublic class TabPagerAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter  private ListltFragmentgt fragments  public TabPagerAdapterFragmentManager fm, ListltFragmentgt fragments      superfm     this.fragments  fragments   Override public Fragment getItemint position      return this.fragments.getposition   Override public void setPrimaryItemViewGroup container, int position, Object object      super.setPrimaryItemcontainer, position, object     fragments.getposition   Override public int getCount      return this.fragments.size   codepre

Negative 85897 pIs there a good way to verify whether algorithms written in renderscript are CPU or GPU boundp  pI understand that this decision is made runtime on the device, however, I see inconsistent trace information on Nexus 5 and Nexus 10 devices. Nexus 10 logcat spits out info saying that the algorithm is moved back to CPU if GPU cant handle the kernels, while there is no such trace as far as I have seen on Nexus 5.p  pOne obvious, but less precise way, is to use execution time of rs based algorithms to address the above question.p  pHowever, lately, when I started testing my scripts on Nexus 5, I see that algorithms that are running on GPU on Nexus 10, now strongAPPEARstrong to be running on CPUS on Nexus 5. I would like to confirm this more precisely.p  pOne can imagine why this could be a problem. If one aims to build an app that is expected to give a similar performance across the same class of devices quad cores, good enough GPU  Mali6xx, Adreno3xx, then the performance across these class of devices will not be reliable, since algorithms that benefit from GPU will likely have bad performances on CPUp

For example, to check that a valid integer is read from the user, you can do thisp blockquote  precodeint x if  cin gtgt x        cout ltlt Please enter a valid number ltlt endl  codepre  blockquote   pThis works because the read operation returns a reference to the stream.p blockquote  pI understand that the cin  x operation returns a reference to cin but Im still confused as to how evaluating the reference to the standard input stream object allows you to check that the input is a valid integer.p

Negative 85897 pI am trying to delete a record in my database that will update values in two different tables.  I have a Student table and an Enroll table.  If the student ID and other information is deleted then it should automatically be deleted for the Student table and the Enroll table where the Student ID is the same.

Negative 85897 pI am working on a site that is using css animations and I am having some trouble with firefox.br In some instances it seems like firefox is not reading the updated css file and in other places the css updates.  I have tried a few things to clear the cache and did a hard reload to see if the changes in the css would reflect on the site. I went as far as to uninstall and reinstall firefox.  Here is what I have encountered.  The keyframe animation works perfectly in chrome and safari so far been avoiding IE headaches. I noticed in testing firefox shows one of the text elements about 100px above where it should be. All the values are the same across the browser specific code. The strange part is if I try and change any of the values using firefox prefix it does not change. Say original top is set to 10px and I will change it to 500px, firefox will render it at the same position as 10px. Another reason I thought this might be an issue with firefox not reloading the css file is that I tried commenting off the entire section that animates the text and it will still animate as if I did not comment the code out.  In the other browsers the commented animation would simply not animate.  I did another test by changing the a text color to red instead of white and that change actually updated. p  pAdditionally I use javascript to reverse the animation by removing the class and replacing it with a reverse animation class.  These work fine in chrome and safari as well, but only one of the animated elements works in reverse, but does not change the animation delay to zero in the firefox code.p  pI could use a fresh pair of eyes to see what exactly going on.p  pThanks for your help.p  pHere is the jsfiddle link.

Negative 85897 pIm having some problems with my test approach for a complex project. p  pSituation is as follows we have 2 angular apps and multiple API server applications. The first Angular app contains a form which calls a login API. The API can return lots of different statuses. Of all those statuses only one results in an login which is OK. If this is the case a second angular app is called. If this is not the case one of many partials is loaded within the first app.p  pCurrently I have unit tests for the different components services, controllers etc, e2e tests using protractor to test the behavior of the pages. And finally some integration tests to test functional flows across the multiple front endback end apps. The APIs are fully tested independently. p  pFor the e2e tests of the first Angular app Im now calling the login API to test every partial page. Because we have quite complex and different build processes for the Angular and API apps I would like to remove the API dependency for the e2e tests and test the interface only in the integration test. p  pThe navigation setup is as follows p  pI have a form with a Login Controller and a Navigation Controller. If the form is submitted a login function is called.p  ppseudocodep  precodescope.login  function    callAPIService  if result  ok     scope.redirectscope.pages.ok  else     scope.redirectscope.pages.otherpage   codepre  pIn the navigation controller if have a pages objectp  precodescope.pages    ok  pageName ok, pageUrl url  otherpage pageName nok, pageUrl otherurl codepre  pthe redirect in the navigation controllerp  precodescope.redirect  function redirectobject    scope.navigateToPage  redirectobject    codepre  pThen in the indexp  pngrepeatpage in pages ngifnavigateToPage.pageName  page.pageName     ngincludepage.pageURLp  pSo this works fine. However now i would like to access the otherpage without calling the login function. So i would like to call the redirect function in the navigation controller with the otherpage object.

Negative 85897 pI have a process that was started with a desktop shortcut. The desktop shortcut has information in the Start In field. I would like to get the Start In information for the process. Is this possible  How would I do it using Powershellp  pI have looked at the properties returned by GetProcess and GetWMIObject win32process but I cannot seem to find where I can find the Start in information.  TIAp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe reason I need this information is that I have a couple of programs ran by python.  I have shortcuts setup to start these.  The shortcut target isp  precodepython.exe myscript.py codepre  pHowever, there are a couple of versions of myscript.py on the computer, none of which are on the PATH.  I set the Start in property of shortcut to control which version of myscript.py is executed.p  pI realize there are other ways to change so that I could tell which script version is running, however Im trying to not make changes to the existing setup, and write a powershell script that could get this information.p
Negative 85897 pMy setup is simplified like thisp  pMy main window consists only of a codeContentPresentercode and every visual thing is a codeViewcode filled with data from a codeViewModelcode linked by a set of codeDataTemplatecodes assigning each codeViewModelcode to a specific codeViewcode.p  pThe codeViewcodes also contain codeContentPresentercodes and codeItemControlcodes to display nested codeViewModelcodes.p  pYou can think of the main window as display each file and folder recursively starting from this folder and there are codeViewcodescodeViewModelcodes for files and folders.p  pI preload the codeViewModelcode in a background thread and display a loading message in the main window the main window is responsive albeit you cannot do anything anyway.p  pAfter the codeViewModelcodes are all created, I marshall the swapping of the DataContext.p  pUntil the codeViewcodes are all fully loaded, the main window freezes for approx. 2 seconds.p  pProfiling the application doesnt show this time, most likely because its done in some WPF core that is not profiled.p  pstrongIs there a way to preloadprerender the codeViewcodes without blocking the UIstrongp  pI know that when the application is not showing anything while being blocked this may not be of concern in this concrete case. But there are similar cases where there is something useful displayed.p

Negative 85897 pIve been trying to figure out how to implement a problem linked further down but, Im hitting a wall.p  pBasically I have to reformat source code that uses next line curly braces to end of line curly braces. For some reason, the professor for my class decided to assign this problem in our Strings chapter and not in the Text IO chapter which is about 5 chapters later.p  precodeString sourceString  new StringFiles.readAllBytesPaths.getTest.txt String formatted  sourceString.replaceAlls,  System.out.printlnformatted codepre  pSo thats what I have so far. When I do a run, the output is the same as the source file. I followed this a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions18444199reformattingsourcecodewithtextioproblema and using an idiom I found to convert all of the file into a String, the replaceAll method stopped... replacing. p  pWhile I still had it set up like this p  precodeStringBuilder source  new StringBuilder     whiles.hasNext         source.appends.nextLine          String sourceString  source.toString     String formatted  sourceString.replaceAlls,       System.out.printlnformatted codepre  pthe output is all on a single line. I feel like the replaceAll method isnt occurring at all. I feel like Im forgetting something blatantly obvious.p
Negative 85897 pI was hoping that someone on here would be able to explain or point me to a webpage where I could learn more about Matlabs memory management. I know that Matlab is a higher level language so it takes care of memory management, which is good and bad.

This isnt happening for me and I cant figure out why.p  pEdit Relevant codep  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtml langenusgt ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     lttitlegtSartres Listlttitlegt     ltlink hrefhttpfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyLato300,700,300italic,700italic relstylesheet typetextcssgt     ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssmain.cssgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idwrapgt     ltdiv classtopgt     ltheadergt             lth1gtlta hrefindex.htmlgtSartres Listltagtlth1gt             lth2gtBetterDressed Peoplelth2gt             ltnavgt                     lta hrefgtWomensltagt                     lta hrefgtMensltagt                     lta hrefgtOn the Streetltagt                     lta hrefgtThe Catwalkltagt                     lta hrefgtAdWatchltagt                     lta hrefgtAboutltagt             ltnavgt     ltheadergt ltdivgt     ltdiv classitemgt     ltarticlegt             lth3gt111213lth3gt             lth2gtlta hrefgtOn the Street in Brooklynltagtlth2gt             ltimg srcimgfashionphoto.jpeggt             ltpgt article contentltagtlth4gt     ltarticlegt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classitemgt     ltarticlegt             lth3gt111113lth3gt             lth2gtlta hrefgtVintage in Vogueltagtlth2gt             ltimg srcimgfashionphoto2.jpeggt             ltpgt Article Contentltpgt             lth4gtlta hrefgtContinues...ltagtlth4gt     ltarticlegt ltdivgt     ltfootergt             ltnavgt                     lta hrefindex.htmlgtHomeltagt                                          lta hrefgtWomensltagt                                          lta hrefgtMensltagt                                          lta hrefgtOn the Streetltagt                                          lta hrefgtThe Catwalkltagt                                          lta hrefgtAdWatchltagt                                          lta hrefgtAboutltagt                                          lta hrefgtTipsltagt             ltnavgt             ltpgtampcopy 2013 Valet Industries, Inc.ltpgt     ltfootergt ltdivgt ltdiv idsidebarWrapgt ltdiv classsidebargtAbout usltdivgt ltdiv classsidebargtAdltdivgt ltdiv classsidebargtPopular Postsltdivgt ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pHere is the CSSp  precodebody      margin 0     paddingleft 3em     fontfamily Lato, sansserif     fontsize 18px     lineheight 1.5     background FFF     color 444     borderleft 6px solid DDD     float left    a      color D00     textdecoration none     webkittransition all 300ms  ahover      color A00   h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6      margin 0     padding 0   h1, h2  display inline  h1      fontsize 3em     fontweight normal   h2      fontsize 2em     fontweight normal     color gray     margin 15px     padding 0  h2 a      color inherit  h2 ahover      color D00   h3      fontsize 2em     fontweight normal     color CCC     margin 0     padding 0   h4      textalign right   img      display block     margin 10px 0     maxwidth 100    header h2      fontsize 1.5em     marginbottom .5em   footer      color BBB     header nav a      display inlineblock     fontsize 1.25em     margin 0     color DDD     borderbottom 2px solid EEE     background black     padding 10px     height        header nav ahover      color gray     borderbottomcolor BBB   article      borderbottom 1px solid DDD     margin 3em 0     paddingbottom 1.5em  article pfirstletter      float left     fontsize 6em     lineheight 1     color DDD     margin .1em .1em 0 .1em    wrap      width 750     margin 0 auto     padding 0     maxwidth 40em   sidebarWrap      float right     height 100   .top      float top  .item      float left  .sidebar      float right codepre  pWhen I look at this in Chrome, the body shows that it is not covering the entire page.

Negative 85897 pIm trying to implement the Repository Pattern with UoW for our small Application. As far as i read the main Idea of the UoW is to expose the Repositories via one Context and to Save all Stuff in one step, f.e. with Transaction, to make sure the Operations are atomic.p  pEverything fine so far and I checked the examples like a hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsgettingstartedwithef5usingmvc4implementingtherepositoryandunitofworkpatternsinanaspnetmvcapplication relnofollowhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsgettingstartedwithef5usingmvc4implementingtherepositoryandunitofworkpatternsinanaspnetmvcapplicationa p  pThe problem We have a logical BusinessModel, which gets Data from the TFS API and a SQLDatabase using Entitiy Framework. So we have seperate Systems and no Contexts.  UoW still seems a good Idea to implement Rollback, if one System could not save properly etc., but does it need Repository as well If I create a Repository, which hold just a List of the logical BusinessModel and gets the Data from EFTFS API, I could do everything Id like to in it.p  pDid I understand these two Concepts wrong Or is just our environment not workingfor this Patternsp  pThanks in advancep  pMatthiasp  pEdit To show what I mean We have a DataLayer.TFS Project, which we can query TFSrelevant data like thisp  precodeIEnumerableltWorkItemgt tfsItems  TFS.QueryByParametercriterias codepre  pAnd we have a DataLayer.SQL Project, where we have the EF and query data like thisp  precode        using var context  new SimpleContextContainer                      Some Tables to List  etc.          codepre  pThen we have a ugly procedure called Concat, which merges the two Listsp  precode    private static ListltNewItemgt ConcatIEnumerableltWorkItemgt tfsItems, IEnumerableltOldDBItemgt dbItems              ListltNewItemgt result  new ListltNewItemgt         foreachvar tfsItem in tfsItems                      var tmpItem  new NewItem             tmpItem.PbiId  tfsItem.Id             Do this for all properties              result.AddtmpItem                  return result      codepre  pAnd we have an opposite Prodecure for splitting the Data.p
Negative 85897 pI am wondering how to achieve a high level of automated testing. Currently we are quite strict with creating unit tests, and this works no problem. At the moment we are using TFS and a nightly build which runs all of our unit tests.p  pWhat I am hoping to add are some automated integration, performance, and load tests. For all of these sorts of tests different parts of the system will have to interact with other parts of the system and with the file system andor databases.p  pI know this isnt allowed for unit tests and indeed we make sure we can mock any of those interactions for unit tests. However we would like to have some performance tests run and the data collected in a way which is something like x takes y long to run. If x includes some file system reads in the real world then it needs to perform file reads in the tests, so the data is accurate.p  pAre there any methods which help in achieving automated tests which rely on interaction with other componentsp  pAt the moment we are doing all of this manually...p

Negative 85897 pIve got a web mysql DB that my Android app gets data from.  The DB on the web is similar to the one on the phone, and in several cases there are tables that need to be in synch.  p  pTables arent huge, but theres a lot of text. Simplest approach would be to drop the tables and recreate them, then insert all the data again.  Even to my amateur coder mind, this is silly and hugely inefficient.p  pHeres what Ive done, and this works... but my question is, Is there a smarter, simpler, or more refined way to do it.p  precode Android app sends request to web mysql.   Web returns the tables that must be in synch via JSON  Android parses JSON  Android queries each table for IDs  Android loops through each tables IDs and within the loop, compares JSON IDs        If ID is not on device, Insert this record.        If ID is on device, but not in JSON, delete from device.  Repeat for every table that needs to be in synch codepre  pI need certain parts of the DB to remain on the phone and be in synch, but I am just wondering if there is a builtin or more intelligent solution than thisp  pThank youp
Negative 85897 pSo I recently came accros this. I was creating an ifelsestatement with as its condition a final boolean variable.

Negative 85897 pI am searching for support in PostgreSQL to process protein sequences for tasks which seem generic or common enough that I suspect that I am not applying the correct Google query terms or defining the problems in the best way.  I am aware of PostBIS and PostBio, but these seem to be more focused on detecting sequence relationships rather than applying them.p  pPrimitive functions that I am initially looking for are along the lines ofp  pstrongmaskingstrong given array1 1..n of chars and array2 1..n of bool equivalents, return array3 which is array1 masked by array2 either nulling out or splicing out columns in array1 where array2 is false.  Alternatively array2 could be start and end positions instead of the full n columns.p  pstrongmappingstrong given array1 1..n, array2 1..m, and some mapping that tells me e.g. column 10 in array1 is column 28 in array2, return array3 which has the array2 values in the mapped array1 positions.  Again as above, the mapping implementation could be start and end positions of aligned segments instead of full n and m column maps in each direction.p  pI can envision doing this in database tables with e.g. sequenceID, sequenceIndex and alignMap columns, but it seems like this will generate vast numbers of rows per sequence position to index and join across when my software accessing the database usually wants to work on full sequence chunks anyway.  p  pIs there an existing module or approach I should be considering  An elegant expression with unnest and arrayagg please outline  Arrays in PostgreSQL are new to me, but I am learning that processing inside the database is often faster than outside with e.g. perl.  My current PostgreSQL version is 9.1 but expect to move to 9.2 soon.p  pAn application of this would be protein sequence A aligns to structure Z, so where does As feature x appear on Zp

Negative 85897 pIm using a windows installer package to distribute a winforms application to several clients and because some of them have changed their security policies I need to figure out a way to run the application updates through the installer for users without administration rights.p  pFind below some information regarding the update process  The installer is created using InstallAware  During the update process the old version is uninstalled and the new version is installed.  The installer needs admin rights because it writes to the registry and installs some windows services.  The application is installed in the program files folder.p  pAt this moment the solution that Im implementing is create a new scheduler task, that runs a simple console application that check for new updates and if a new version exists it downloads the installer and executes it in silence mode the entire installation will execute silently, without a user interface, or any user intervention. The default values of dialog controls will be used.p  pSome consideration about this solution  Its difficult to handle possible errors during the update process.  Its not possible to alert the user that a update process is running because the scheduler tasks runs with a different user is not possible interact with the logged user. p  pHas anyone ever implemented anything similar Is this the best way to achieve my goalp
Negative 85897 pWere currently working on a rewrite of the Directory of our Peer to Peer Service Bus a hrefhttpsgithub.comAbcArbitrageZebus relnofollowZebusa.p  pWe had a CassandraThrift implementation and it had to be improved to meet some new load requirements, so rewriting it using CQL seemed to be the right thing to do.p  pWe have two CFs, one to store Peers and one to store Subscriptions, the latter being the trickiest.p  pWe need to store a list of routing keys bindings for each message type, and a list of message types for each peer. We also need to be able to update each message types routings list separately we use Cassandras timestamps to handle potential race conditions since we have multiple Directories. And finally, we need to be able to list all those subscriptions when someone requests the Peers state.p  pThe last point was a problem, because it means running a codeSELECT  FROM Subscriptionscode, which means listing rows from multiple nodes BTW how does CQL allows you to list underlying Cassandra rows and happens to be pretty slow.p  pSo we ended up having the following schema for our CF to store everything consecutively on disk on the same Cassandra row and have great read performance we are aware of the fact that this is pretty bad at balancing the data between nodes.p  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS DynamicSubscriptions      UselessKey boolean,     PeerId text,     MessageTypeId text,        SubscriptionBindings blob,     PRIMARY KEYUselessKey, PeerId, MessageTypeId  codepre  pThis is pretty ugly but does the trick, everyone ends up on the same Thrift row, resulting in lightning fast reads.p  pSo my question is the following Is there a strongprettystrong way to design a CF using CQL if I want my data to be queryable really fast during an unconstrained SELECTp  pOr if you think that our design is completely flawed, feel free to say so.p

I am doing this because, as I understand it, this is the way to share information across view models while adhering to the MVVM pattern. I have one other view model called PlotViewModel that listens to these changes and adds the point to its own instance of the collectedPoints variable when the message is received.p  pIn the PlotViewModel class, I have a Handle method which listens for the event aggregator messages. In that method I add the received new data point to PlotViewModels collectedPoints variable. The Handle method looks like thisp  precodepublic void HandleEventMessage message      switch message.Identifier              case CollectedPoint             DataPoint tmp  DataPointmessage.Value             CollectedPoints.Addtmp             flowmetSum  tmp.Y             pointCount             break       codepre  pIn the rest of the PlotViewModel I operate on this collectedPoints variable via a background thread and perform many operations.p  pThe issue that I am running into with this approach is that, due to the rapid nature in which the data points are sent, I am running into consistency issues with collectedPoints in the PlotViewModel. When I am trying to process the collectedPoints collection, it will simultaneously update in the Handle method and cause inconsistency issues such as zeroed entries. My question is how do I ensure that the collectedPoints variable doesnt change while the processing is being done I know that one solution might be to collect the data points into a buffer and send that buffer via the event aggregator, but this application needs to plot in realtime, so that isnt really an option.

Negative 85897 pIn case of a clear probable direction of where the user will go for example image gallery or similar one may not only guess where the user will go after his next click, one may predict the next 5 clicks or more.p  pWhen one uses prerenderlinks or prefetch for browsers that dont understand prerender to multiple pages, the browser will download and render all these links, but will it forget the data after the user has clicked on a link, and how long stays the prefetchedprerendered version usable Is there any clear documentation on that featurep  pIn other words Would a prerenderlink to the next 5 pages make the website faster because the user can skip a page quickly or slower because the browser needlessly prerenders 5 pages on every clickp  pEdit I have now made some tests and it seems as if multiple prerenderlinks doesnt make it faster if you just put in prerender links.p

Negative 85897 pI have used conditional formatting to shade cells red in a saved range named Loops1000 that have duplicate values.  For discussion sake the range is codeA1Z100code.  So now I have maybe 100 cells with various tag data in them e.g. codeC03012034code.  The formatting is General.  I want to search the Range and find all the red colored cells background red  3 I believe and return the data in them to a single empty column AA in ascending order.p  pI looked up one solution on this site utilizing Name Manager to make a function called codeCellColorcode.

Negative 85897 pI am programming an Android App, and a Friend of mine does the same for iOS. Now I have to choose a Color, but I am not sure, if I should take one of the Material Design colors, or if we should choose one on our own. The advantage of the Google provided colors are, that they fit very good to the whole design, but I am afraid, that the recognition value of our App is compromised.br Also on iOS the Material Design Colors doesnt really fit, so we probably would have two different colors. Do you think this is a Problem, when we try to build a own brand I hope this is the correct forum. Thanks in advance.p

Any pointers to what I need to check will be very helpful. p  pThis is not a case of low memory as I see free memory from Crashlytics. p  precodeThread  Crashed com.apple.mainthread 0  libobjc.A.dylib                0x0000000192953bd0 objcmsgSend  16 1  CoreFoundation                 0x00000001820d5228 CFRelease  524 2  CoreFoundation                 0x00000001821e62ac [NSArrayM removeAllObjects]  284 3  MyApp                          0x00000001004a69e0 msgpackzonefree 4  MyApp                          0x00000001004a4afc msgpackzonefree 5  CoreFoundation                 0x000000018219cae4 CFNOTIFICATIONCENTERISCALLINGOUTTOANOBSERVER  20 6  CoreFoundation                 0x00000001820db220 CFXNotificationPost  2060 7  Foundation                     0x0000000182fdac60 [NSNotificationCenter postNotificationNameobjectuserInfo]  72 8  UIKit                          0x0000000186c32e98 [UIApplication handleApplicationDectivationWithSceneshouldForceExittransitionContextcompletion]  1132 9  UIKit                          0x0000000186c3b370 88[UIApplication handleApplicationLifecycleEventWithScenetransitionContextcompletion]blockinvoke  92 10 UIKit                          0x0000000186c3b2f8 [UIApplication handleApplicationLifecycleEventWithScenetransitionContextcompletion]  380 11 UIKit                          0x0000000186c2ec2c [UIApplication scenedidUpdateWithDifftransitionContextcompletion]  512 12 FrontBoardServices             0x000000018a45d62c 31[FBSSerialQueue performAsync]blockinvoke  28 13 CoreFoundation                 0x00000001821aea28 CFRUNLOOPISCALLINGOUTTOABLOCK  20 14 CoreFoundation                 0x00000001821adb30 CFRunLoopDoBlocks  312 15 CoreFoundation                 0x00000001821ac154 CFRunLoopRun  1756 16 CoreFoundation                 0x00000001820d90a4 CFRunLoopRunSpecific  396 17 GraphicsServices               0x000000018b2735a4 GSEventRunModal  168 18 UIKit                          0x0000000186a0aaa4 UIApplicationMain  1488 19 MyApp                          0x00000001000cce40 main main.m16 20 libdyld.dylib                  0x0000000192faea08 start  4 codepre  pThanks.p
Negative 85897 pI am writing a custom modified version of a naive Bayes in R and am running into runtime issues due to the size of data being process.  I need to process 145k rows each with 95 elements.  I currently am using the following function to get the first step of the Naive Bayes.p  precodeprobGen lt functionx, i    return1sqrt2pisdBreakdown[i,]2             expx  meanBreakdown[i,]22sdBreakdown[i,]2  codepre  pIn this function sdBreakdown and meanBreakdown are aggregate values for each possible solution.  Each time the apply is run we get the probabilities for each given column.  The apply is run as follows on the matrix where each row is another element we are trying to classify.p  precodetest.1 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 1 test.2 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 2 test.3 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 3 test.4 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 4 test.5 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 5 test.6 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 6 test.7 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 7 test.8 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 8 test.9 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 9 codepre  pHere is how I am currently calling each apply.  This gives each elements probabilities for each possible classification 19.  I dont want to use the out of the box Naive Bayes because I am trying to get a better understanding of R and have a few potential accuracy improvements  I want to experiment with.p  pIm not sure how to make this run in a more timely fashion though as coded it takes several hours and can take up to 7 or 8 if Im actively working on other projects while it runs.p  pEditp  pTo clarify the data in this example.p  ptemp is the 145kx95 matrix of where each row is an item to be classified and each column is a quality represented numerically.p  pmeanBreakdown is a 9x95 matrix each row is a different classification and each column corresponds to the mean average quality for the classification.p  psdBreakdown is the same as meanBreakdown except stores standard deviation rather than mean average.p  pParallel processing seems like it would work, but I didnt thinkclearly I was wrong the data set as large enough for the to be necessary.p  pEdit 2  Here is the full code.  Forgive me if it is exceptionally bad R code.  I have always been a C developer so R is a big change in thinking and Ive only done a handful of small projects in R to learn the ins and outs.p  precodetraining lt read.csvfile  datatrain.csv, sep,, headerT  negativeOne lt functionx    x lt pmin1, x   return1meanx   pullZeros lt functionx    x lt ifelsex  0, 1, 0   returnmeanx   trainingSet lt functionx    x lt ifelsex  0, NA, x   returnmeanx, na.rmT  trainingSetSd lt functionx    x lt ifelsex  0, NA, x   returnsdx, na.rmT   positiveBreakDown lt aggregatextraining[,colnamestraining[greplfeat,colnamestraining]],                          bylisttrainingtarget, FUNtrainingSet  positiveBreakDownSd lt aggregatextraining[,colnamestraining[greplfeat,colnamestraining]],                                bylisttrainingtarget, FUNtrainingSetSd  negativeBreakDown lt aggregatextraining[,colnamestraining[greplfeat,colnamestraining]],                      bylisttrainingtarget, FUNnegativeOne  meanBreakdown lt positiveBreakDown[,colnamespositiveBreakDown[greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDown]]  sdBreakdown lt positiveBreakDownSd[,colnamespositiveBreakDownSd[greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDownSd]]  probGen lt functionx, i    return1sqrt2pisdBreakdown[i,]2             expx  meanBreakdown[i,]22sdBreakdown[i,]2   test lt  read.csvfile  datatest.csv, sep,, headerT  PosTest lt test[,colnamestest[greplfeat,colnamestest]]   NegTest lt aggregatextest[,colnamestest[greplfeat,colnamestest]],                   bylisttestid, FUNpullZeros  NegTestGroup.1 lt NULL temp lt PosTest  sweepTest.1 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 1 sweepTest.2 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 2 sweepTest.3 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 3 sweepTest.4 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 4 sweepTest.5 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 5 sweepTest.6 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 6 sweepTest.7 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 7 sweepTest.8 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 8 sweepTest.9 lt tapplytemp,MARGIN1,FUNprobGen, 9  temp lt NegTest tempGroup.1 lt NULL  N.sweepTest.1 lt sweepas.matrixtemp,MARGIN2,                        as.numericnegativeBreakDown[1, greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDown], N.sweepTest.2 lt sweepas.matrixtemp,MARGIN2,                        as.numericnegativeBreakDown[2, greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDown], N.sweepTest.3 lt sweepas.matrixtemp,MARGIN2,                        as.numericnegativeBreakDown[3, greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDown], N.sweepTest.4 lt sweepas.matrixtemp,MARGIN2,                        as.numericnegativeBreakDown[4, greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDown], N.sweepTest.5 lt sweepas.matrixtemp,MARGIN2,                        as.numericnegativeBreakDown[5, greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDown], N.sweepTest.6 lt sweepas.matrixtemp,MARGIN2,                        as.numericnegativeBreakDown[6, greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDown], N.sweepTest.7 lt sweepas.matrixtemp,MARGIN2,                        as.numericnegativeBreakDown[7, greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDown], N.sweepTest.8 lt sweepas.matrixtemp,MARGIN2,                        as.numericnegativeBreakDown[8, greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDown], N.sweepTest.9 lt sweepas.matrixtemp,MARGIN2,                        as.numericnegativeBreakDown[9, greplfeat,colnamespositiveBreakDown],   sweepTest.1 lt 1N.sweepTest.1  1sweepTest.1  N.sweepTest.1 sweepTest.2 lt 1N.sweepTest.2  1sweepTest.2  N.sweepTest.2 sweepTest.3 lt 1N.sweepTest.3  1sweepTest.3  N.sweepTest.3 sweepTest.4 lt 1N.sweepTest.4  1sweepTest.4  N.sweepTest.4 sweepTest.5 lt 1N.sweepTest.5  1sweepTest.5  N.sweepTest.5 sweepTest.6 lt 1N.sweepTest.6  1sweepTest.6  N.sweepTest.6 sweepTest.7 lt 1N.sweepTest.7  1sweepTest.7  N.sweepTest.7 sweepTest.8 lt 1N.sweepTest.8  1sweepTest.8  N.sweepTest.8 sweepTest.9 lt 1N.sweepTest.9  1sweepTest.9  N.sweepTest.9  rmN.sweepTest.1,N.sweepTest.2,N.sweepTest.3,N.sweepTest.4,N.sweepTest.5,N.sweepTest.6,N.sweepTest.7,N.sweepTest.8,N.sweepTest.9  dist lt 19  fori in 19    dist[i] lt nrowtraining[trainingtarget  paste0Class,i,]   res1 lt dist[1]applytsweepTest.1, MARGIN2, FUNprod res2 lt dist[2]applytsweepTest.2, MARGIN2, FUNprod res3 lt dist[3]applytsweepTest.3, MARGIN2, FUNprod res4 lt dist[4]applytsweepTest.4, MARGIN2, FUNprod res5 lt dist[5]applytsweepTest.5, MARGIN2, FUNprod res6 lt dist[6]applytsweepTest.6, MARGIN2, FUNprod res7 lt dist[7]applytsweepTest.7, MARGIN2, FUNprod res8 lt dist[8]applytsweepTest.8, MARGIN2, FUNprod res9 lt dist[9]applytsweepTest.9, MARGIN2, FUNprod  rmsweepTest.1,sweepTest.2,sweepTest.3,sweepTest.4,sweepTest.5,sweepTest.6,sweepTest.7,sweepTest.8,sweepTest.9  interRes lt data.frameClass1  res1, Class2  res2,Class3  res3,                        Class4  res4,Class5  res5,Class6  res6,                        Class7  res7,Class8  res8,Class9  res9   rmres1,res2,res3,res4,res5,res6,res7,res8,res9  temp lt applytinterRes, MARGIN2, FUNsum  tempRes lt interRestemp  datalt data.frameidtestid  data lt cbinddata,tempRes  fname lt file.choose write.tabledata, fname, row.namesFALSE, sep,  codepre

Negative 85897 pActually i m creating a framework in php that is similer to Java Servlet Model but use Facebook Big pipe similer technology. p  pTo clear take a look at this Servlet  PHP Servlet  p  precode    ltphp        class loginservlet extends Servlet            public function doGetrequest, response                 responsegtgetWritergtwritehii                    end of doGet

Negative 85897 pIm writing a Linux kernel driver for a device that has quite a bit going on and a bunch of interaction from userspace. In order to debug and troubleshoot these interactions Im storing them in a data array in the driver and need to export this data to userspace via some sort of file node. Itd be great if I could just export the binary data and let userspace parse it into humanreadable text but the requirement from other parties involved is to have this done indriver so one can just cat the file node from the command line and get something readable. p  pCurrently Im just using a sysfs node but Im pretty sure thats the wrong place for that sort of thing and I need to able to write out more than PAGESIZE of data.

Negative 85897 pIn order to prevent that one build influences another it is possible to configure a Jenkins project to use a own private Maven repository. However, because we have actually a huge list of dependencies, this leads to a lot of wasted disk space and to slow builds. We use a Maven repository proxy, but still the time to download artifacts over the local network is significant.p  pI could set up another repository proxy directly on the Jenkins machine. Is there an easier solutionp  pI still want that any maven install goes to a projectspecific repo, while reading of artifacts that have not been deployed to that projectspecific repo should come from a central place on the local filesystem. Those artifacts should strongnotstrong be copied for performance and disk space reasons.  p  pTo explain the background I append the help text of the Use private Maven repository optionp  blockquote   pNormally, Jenkins uses the local Maven repository as determined by   Maven  the exact process seems to be undocumented, but its   .m2repository and can be overridden by  in   .m2settings.xml see the reference for more details.p      pThis normally means that all the jobs that are executed on the same   node shares a single Maven repository. The upside of this is that you   can save the disk space, but the downside of this is that sometimes   those builds could interfere with each other. For example, you might   end up having builds incorrectly succeed, just because your have all   the dependencies in your local repository, despite that fact that none   of the repositories in POM might have them.p      pThere are also some reported problems regarding having concurrent   Maven processes trying to use the same local repository.p      pWhen this option is checked, Jenkins will tell Maven to use   WORKSPACE.repository as the local Maven repository. This means each   job will get its own isolated Maven repository just for itself. It   fixes the above problems, at the expense of additional disk space   consumption.p      pWhen using this option, consider setting up a Maven artifact manager   so that you dont have to hit remote Maven repositories too often.p      pIf youd prefer to activate this mode in all the Maven jobs executed   on Jenkins, refer to the technique described a hrefhttpjenkins.361315.n4.nabble.comHudsonon24816coreboxestd371215.htmla371217 relnofollowherea.p blockquote

Negative 85897 pIm using Wildfly 8.2 and fire a series of DB requests when a certain web page is opened. All queries are invoked thru JPA Criteria API, return results as expected  and  none of them delivers a warning, error or exception. It all runs in Parallel Plesk.p  pNow, I noticed that within 2 to 3 days the following error appears and the site becomes unresponsive. I restart and I wait approx another 3 days till it happens again depending on the number of requests I have. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com1XPG8.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1XPG8.png altenter image description hereap  pI checked the tcpsndbuf on my linux server and I noticed it is constantly at max.

Apparently it fails to release the connections.  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comyUr6T.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyUr6T.png altenter image description hereap  pThe connections are managed by JPAHibernate and the Wildfly container. I dont do any special or custom transaction handling e.g. open, close. etc. I leave it all to Wildfly.p  pThe MySQL Driver Im using is 5.1.21 mysqlconnectorjava5.1.21bin.jarp  pIn the standalone.xml I have defined the following datasource datasource values among othersp  precodelttransactionisolationgtTRANSACTIONREADCOMMITTEDlttransactionisolationgt ltpoolgt     ltminpoolsizegt3ltminpoolsizegt     ltmaxpoolsizegt10ltmaxpoolsizegt ltpoolgt ltstatementgt      ltpreparedstatementcachesizegt32ltpreparedstatementcachesizegt      ltsharedpreparedstatementsgttrueltsharedpreparedstatementsgt ltstatement codepre  pHas anyone experience the same rise of tcpsndbuf values or this error In case you require more config or log files, let me know.

Negative 85897 pI have a working WSO2 Identity Server cluster. As these servers are going to manage a lot of traffic, i also set up an nginx balancer and opened the service login endpoint at port 9443. p  pAs the balancer is configured to keep sessions, i added the iphash argument to the balancer config and restarted the service. The browser is now trowing the following error An error occurred during a connection to balancer9443. SSL received a record that exceeded the maximum permissible length. Error code sslerrorrxrecordtoolong. Okay, so i must enable SSL for this connection as per a hrefhttpscloud.google.comsolutionshttpsloadbalancingnginx relnofollowthisa guide. Simple enough...

Negative 85897 pOkay, so heres my problem, theres a webpage on our intranet that I must login to in order to gain access through one of our firewalls. I require this access the entire time Im working but it automatically logs off every 60 minutes so I have to stop what Im doing, go back to the page, enter my username amp password amp log in again. This repeats itself for about 9 hours or until I get off work.p  pIve been working on a VBScript that I could schedule to run every 60 minutes for me. Currently Im able to do this via this strongbasicstrong script...p  precodeConst strID  username Const strPswd  password  Set oShell  CreateObjectWScript.Shell oShell.Runhttps00.0.00.000000phpuid.phpvsys1ampurlhttpwww.yyy.net2f  WScript.Sleep 3000 oShell.SendKeys strID oShell.SendKeys TAB wScript.Sleep 1000 oShell.SendKeys strPswd WScript.Sleep 1000 OShell.SendKeys TAB OShell.SendKeys ENTER WScript.Sleep 1500  Set IE  CreateObjectShell.Application Set windows  IE.Windows  For Each window In IE.windows     If leftwindow.LocationUrl, 5 ltgt file Then         If InStrwindow.locationUrl, httpwww.yyy.net Then window.Quit         If UCasewindow.locationUrl  UCaseabouttabs Then window.Quit     End If Next codepre  pThe above script works of course amp Im currently using it however, the problem is, ifwhen the script runs before youre logged out then you receive an error from the script amp obviously it wont run again for another hour. This inspired me to dive deeper into scripting. I began searching around for similar topicsmethods, examining others codes, etc. just to get some ideas. My first attempt was to accomplish the same thing as the above script except completely hidden amp without the use of SendKeys. My goal was to put together a script like this...p  pNavigate to the page amp then check the heading string...if its  xxxx then youre logged out so set the values for the username amp password elements amp submit them...otherwise, if its  yyyy then youre still logged in so Sleep for 10sec., reload amp check again. I was almost certain this would work but with this script, no matter WHAT I looked for with codedocument.getElementByIdzzzcode, I ALWAYS get the null error. Its as if no elements even exist amp Ive used every single codeNamecode amp codeIDcode I can find in the source. If interested, I can post this script as well but I ended up moving on to a completely different approachp  pAfter the above issues I started reading about XMLHttp amp sending the data this way instead. Using Fiddler I logged into the webpage like normal amp was able to find the string with the usernamepassword which gets sent to the server amp tried writing a script to accomplish it. This is what I now have...p  precodeCall Main  Function Main  User  myusername Pass  mypassword  This is the string Fiddler revealed is being sent to server at login... inputStrampescapeUseruserampuseruseramppasswdpasswdampokLogin  So I create this string with my information instead of elements values... Credentials  inputStrampescapeUser amp User amp ampuser amp User amp amppasswd amp Pass amp ampokLogin  Set objXML  CreateObjectMsxml2.XMLHttp.6.0 objXML.Open POST, https00.0.00.000000phpuid.phpvsys1ampurlhttpwww.yyy.net2f, False objXML.SetRequestHeader ContentType, applicationxwwwformurlencoded objXML.Send Credentials  End Function codepre  pUsing the above method, it shouldnt matter if I was or wasnt logged in, the data would still be sent amp no errors would be raised. But this script does nothing, it runs, I dont get any errors, Im still not logged in amp Fiddler doesnt even show any requests having been sent or received after I run it.

Negative 85897 pIm new to c and trying to write a console application that takes the time signature and BPM information from a users musical project and returns the length of one bar in seconds.p  pI want to take the user input string for time signature example 44, isolate the first character a numeral representing the number of beats per bar, and transform it into an integer to be used in the calculation.p  pThe two methods Ive tried,p  precodeint beatsPerBar  timeSignature[0] codepre  pandp  precodeint beatsPerBar  atoitimeSignature[0] codepre  pboth return the same error subscripted value is neither array nor pointer nor vector.p  pHow do I correctly change the variable type of this characterp  pEDITp  pUsing RSahu s suggestion.

Negative 85897 pI have this CSV file because Apache Pig loads CSV.  One column of the CSV file is a huge block of unstructured paragraphs.  I want to match a word from that unstructured text into one of 80 listed words so that I can classify that record into that word.  p  pe.g.p  pMy classifications are A1, A2, A3 ... A80.p  pA3 may appear in the beginning, middle, or end of the unstructured text in the CSV column. Then the record will be classified as A3.p  pHow should I go about this I am thinking of using regex but 80 is quite a large number for patterns.  Im also thinking of having a separate databaselistjson for the 80 words and match the text into that file.  Is that possiblep  pMy second issue is that it should be done with support for mapreduce functions.p  pI have no working knowledge on Apache Pig and Im not sure if this is the right tool to use for my problem.  I wanted to implement this in a cluster with mapreduce functions to lessen the processing time of my records.  Perhaps theres another tool that can be used which will be effective for this type of problem  The mapreduce is indispensable because I need to demonstrate that categorizing my records will only take a short amount of time using multiple PCs.p  pThanks.p

Negative 85897 pI have been banging my head with Carrierwave.

Product.rbp  precodeclass Product lt ActiveRecordBase   mountuploaders avatar, ProductUploader end codepre  pAnd I essentially followed the rules and was able to upload multiple files all while having each file iterate through the create method in my codeproductscontroller.rbcode and creating a new Product instance for each file being uploaded.p  pNow.

Negative 85897 pI am trying to write an implementation of codeSetcode which has an additional method coderandomElementcode which returns an element at random from the codeSetcode. I have based the implementation on codeHashSetcode for a fast codecontainscode method. I have also used an codeArrayListcode so that the coderandomElementcode method is codeO1code too  with an codeArrayListcode all you have to do is choose a random index.p  pHere is my code.p  precodepublic final class RandomChoiceSetltEgt extends AbstractSetltEgt       private final ListltEgt list  new ArrayListltgt     private final SetltEgt set  new HashSetltgt     private final Random random  new Random      public RandomChoiceSet       public RandomChoiceSetCollectionlt extends Egt collection          addAllcollection           public E randomElement          return list.getrandom.nextIntlist.size           Override     public int size          return list.size           Override     public boolean containsObject o          return set.containso           Override     public void clear          list.clear         set.clear           Override     public boolean addE e          boolean result  set.adde         if result             list.adde         return result           Override     public boolean removeObject o          boolean result  set.removeo         if result             list.removeo         return result           Override     public IteratorltEgt iterator          return new IteratorltEgt               private final IteratorltEgt iterator  list.iterator             private E e              Override             public boolean hasNext                  return iterator.hasNext                           Override             public E next                  return e  iterator.next                           Override             public void remove                  iterator.remove                 set.removee                             codepre  pThe drawback to maintaining a codeListcode as well as a codeSetcode is that it makes the coderemovecode method codeOncode because the element has to be found in the codeArrayListcode first, and then all other elements have to be moved along one place. So I was wondering whether it is possible to write such a codeSetcode where all five operations codesizecode, codecontainscode, codeaddcode, coderemovecode and coderandomElementcode are codeO1codep
