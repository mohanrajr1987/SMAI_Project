I want to understand the differences and implications under the hood of this mechanism and how does it work.p  pSo, the first notable difference is naturally in the syntax. The second is that as far as I udnerstand, lambdas may only be implemented as FunctionalInterfaces which requires that the interface we are implementing have only one method, which allows better inference.p  pPremise as I understand a functional interface has a nonobject method a hrefhttpcr.openjdk.java.netbriangoetzlambdalambdatranslation.html relnofollowsource hereap  pMy question is, exactly how do they differ under the hood, by this I mean, if how are they difference in a sense that anonymous classes are instanciated, they ultimately objects, but lambdas.. are not This is what I dont fully understand, are lambdas not really instances of objects What are the real differences of lambdas not being objects in comparison to an anonymous classp

Positive 859 pIve been studying the lambda calculus and recently saw the ChurchRosser theorem. The theorem states that when applying reduction rules to terms in the lambda calculus, the ordering in which the reductions are chosen does not make a difference to the eventual result from wiki. But I find this inconsistent with callbyvalue reduction and normal order reduction. For example, a lambda term z.x.x y can be reduced to z.z when following the normal order reduction rules. But it cannot be further reduced when using callbyvalue reduction because callbyvalue reduction forbids reduction inside a abstraction. So the term term z.x.x y cannot be evaluated to the same result using different rules, which seems to contradict to the ChurchRosser theorem. Whats the problem here Please help me out.Thanks a lotp

Positive 859 pIm having trouble with stdfunctions created from lambdas if the function returns a reference but the return type isnt explicitly called out as a lambda. It seems that the stdfunction is created fine with no warnings, but upon calling it, a value is returned when a reference is expected, causing things to blow up. Heres a very contrived examplep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt include ltfunctionalgt  int main    stdvectorltintgt v    v.pushback123    stdfunctionltconst stdvectorltintgtampconst stdvectorltintgtampgt callback        []const stdvectorltintgt ampinreturn in    stdcout ltlt callbackv.at0 ltlt stdendl    return 0  codepre  pThis prints out garbage, however if the lambda is modified to explicitly return a const reference it works fine. I can understand the compiler thinking the lambda is returnbyvalue without the hint when I originally ran into this problem, the lambda was directly returning the result from a function that returned a const reference, in which case I would think that the const reference return of the lambda would be deducible, but apparently not. What I am surprised by is that the compiler lets the stdfunction be constructed from the lambda with mismatched return types. Is this behavior expected Am I missing something in the standard that allows this mismatch to occur Im seeing this with g GCC 4.8.2, havent tried it with anything else.p  pThanksp

Positive 859 pThe a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavajavaOOmethodreferences.html relnofolloworacle Java 8 documentationa defines 4 types of method references you can use instead of Lambda Expressions. What I am trying to understand is the kind of method reference described as Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type   which is written as codeContainingTypemethodNamecode.p  pI am not sure if I am missing something, but to me it seems more like Reference to the strongfirststrong parameter of the abstract method of the Functional Interface, assuming it is of type codeContainingTypecode. I tried to come up with examples where this arbitrary object is the second parameter, but of course it does not compile.p  pIs there an official reference how this object is resolved by the compiler Am I correct in my understanding thatp  ol liThe arbitrary object has to be the strong1st parameterstrong of the abstract method of the functional interface.li liThe signature of the method reference strongmust be the same as that of the abstract method of the functional interface, without the first parameterstrong. li ol  pSo a functional interface with abstract method codeA methodB b, C c, D dcode can only be passed instance method references codexmethodImplcode or codeBmethodImplcode. There is no way I can pass codeCmethodImplcode for example, where it would be an instance of class codeCcode with its signature codeA methodImplB b, D dcode.p  pAre there any other cases I am missing, which might be the reason why Oracle wrote this in such an ambiguous way p

Negative 859 pI wrote a C program to read an Excel .xls.xlsx file and output to CSV and Unicode text. I wrote a separate program to remove blank records. This is accomplished by reading each line with StreamReader.ReadLine, and then going character by character through the string and not writing the line to output if it contains all commas for the CSV or all tabs for the Unicode text.p  pThe problem occurs when the Excel file contains embedded newlines x0A inside the cells. I changed my XLS to CSV converter to find these new lines since it goes cell by cell and write them as x0A, and normal lines just use StreamWriter.WriteLine.p  pThe problem occurs in the separate program to remove blank records. When I read in with StreamReader.ReadLine, by definition it only returns the string with the line, not the terminator. Since the embedded newlines show up as two separate lines, I cant tell which is a full record and which is an embedded newline for when I write them to the final file.p  pIm not even sure I can read in the x0A because everything on the input registers as n. I could go character by character, but this destroys my logic to remove blank lines.p  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.p

The root of the issue is that the release procedure failed to capture and test some poor quality changes to the trunk. Plugging that hole is most important. Relying on the false assumption that code in the trunk is good is not the solution.p  pOnce that holetestingis plugged, mistakes by everyonenewbie or seniorwill be caught properly and dealt with accordingly.p  pNext, a greater emphasis on code reviews and mentorship probably driven by some systematic changes to encourage it will go a long way toward improving code quality.p  pWith those two fixes in place, I dont think something as rigid or draconian as what I proposed above is necessary.

Negative 859 pLets say Im working on a library that works on items of type Item. The main entry point is a class likep  precodeclass Worker  private   SomeContainer c public     void add const Item ampi      void doSomething  codepre  pThe codedoSomethingcode method looks at the added items, compares them, etc. and does something with them. So the Item class needs an codeoperatorcode.p  pNow, I want to use this library in different environments and in each environment the implementation of the Item class is different. Therefore, Item needs a virtual comparison functionp  precodeclass Item  protected     virtual bool equals Item ampother   0 public     bool operator Item ampother   return equals other    codepre  pAnd each environment has its own Item implementation. The library only knows about the Item class and the specific item classes are defined and implemented in the platformspecific applications using the library. In environment A it might bep  precodeclass AItem public Item  private     bool equals Item ampother      stdstring member ...  codepre  pand in environment Bp  precodeclass BItem public Item  private     bool equals Item ampother      int member ...  codepre  pWhat is now the best way to, for each environment, implement the comparison for use by the library codeequalscode is specified in the Item class , so its specific item implementations need to cast codeothercode to their own type.p  pIn a given environment, different item types will not be used at the same time, so given that assumption, the following would be sortof safep  precodebool AItemequals Item ampother       return thisgtmember  staticcastltAItem ampgtother.member  codepre  pBut it seems like a nasty solution because it allows a programmer using the library to implement a new environment to break things if he adds items of different types to the worker.p  pOther solutions I can think of arep  ul liUse codedynamiccastcode.li liImplement my own sortofRTTI by adding a member to the base Item class indicating the environment. This can then be used in the comparison function to see if codeothercode is of the same type. Not very elegant.li liImplement all the types in the library and select the right one based on a codedefinecode at compiletime. This means the library itself must be extended for each environment.li liUse a templatized worker.li ul  pBut I feel there must be a more elegant solution. Maybe something completely different.

Negative 859 pFor research purposes, I copied a SVN repo to my Windows machine using svnsync so I can replay on my machine without loading the actual server.p  pIve been using PySVN in scripts to control the revision number I want the repo to be in and have been using it fine so far. Now I got a repo from a different project and svnsync got it fine. When I try to run the script in Ubuntu I get codeExpected FS format between 1 and 3 found format 4code p  pFrom what I was able to learn from other questions on StackOverFlow and elsewhere, it seems that my ubuntu pysvn is out of date for a 1.6 subversion version and would only work for 1.5. Did I understand this correctlyp  pBecause on the a hrefhttppysvn.tigris.orgprojectdownloads.html relnofollowpysvn download pagea it says that This release of pysvn has been tested against Subversion 1.5.6 and strongSubversion 1.6.5strongp  pWhen I do codesudo aptget install pythonsvncode it tells me that pythonsvn is already the newest version. So Im assuming that PySVN doesnt support 1.6 Subversion repos.p  pBut if I try running the exact same script on a Windows box, with only pysvn module on it no svn installation, and the local repo files, it runs fine and I can checkout filesp  pSo Im confused. Why does PySVN run with FS format 4 repos on windows and not on Ubuntup

The same rule works perfectly on a nonsitecore site on the same machine. According to the Failed Request Trace, the rewrite module does its thing just fine, but then Sitecore throws an exception, even if the redirect points to another server. This is probably a result of something I have misconfigured, but I just cant understand why it doesnt work.

Negative 859 pIm looking at using Subversion for managing WSDL and XSD artefacts, where I have a service catalogue of around 60 services.  Does anyone know of any articles recommending best practice around this with regards to the granularity between tagging and versions of services.p  pWith SVN, it appears that you can only tag from the trunk.  If our trunk contains all our WSDLs then we would have to tag in a specific way in order to version each service.  For example, if we had a service called AddressManager which was contained in the same trunk as CustomerManager, then in order to tag the trunk to represent a change on the AddressManager service, then the tag would have to be AddressManagerv1.0.0.  Which seems a little unwieldy.p  pIdeal what Id like to get to is to be able to manage my service contracts using SVN and my tags to simply refer to the version number of the service i.e. v1.0.0.  But would this mean a trunk per service  Again, seems like a bit of an overhead.p  pThis has to be a common issue for service contract WSDL amp XSD management  can anyone share any anecdotes or advice on thisp  pThanks,p  pStuartp

I would like to allow other developers to access this core dll as well but I dont want them to have as much access as me since it would be a security risk.  What is the standard way of exposing my core dll  Are there any particular design patterns I should be looking atp  pIm using Cp  pEdit my question was a little vague so here is some clarificationp  pMy program is deployed as a windows exe which references the core.dll. I want other people to create extensions which dynamically get loaded into my program at start up by loading dlls in the extensions directory. The 3rd party dlls will inheritimplement certain classesinterfaces in my core.dll.  I only want to give 3rd parties limited access to my core but I want to give my exe additional access to the core. p  pI should mention that this is the first time I have written a program that imports DLLs. Perhaps this whole method of allowing users to add extensions is wrong.p

Binary data in the dfms files is nothing but a sequence of hexadecimal characters which never spans more than 80 characters per line. An example of it isp  precodePicture.Data         055449636F6E0000010001002020000001000800A80800001600000028000000       2000000040000000010008000000000000000000000000000000000000000000        ...

In the example above the first line is returns the proper token codetkHexValuecode. The second however returns a codetkIntegercode token and the third a codetkIdentifiercode token. So when the parsing comes, it fails with an emsyntax errorem because binary data is composed only of codetkHexValuecode tokens. p  pMy first workaround was to require integers to have a maximum length which helped in all but the last line of the binary data. And the second was to move the codetkHexValuecode token above the codetkIdentifiercode but it means that now I will not have identifiers like codeF0codep  pI was wondering if there is any way to fix this grammarp

Negative 859 pWe have a registered PC based application that needs a Dongle hardware that gets plugged on the printer port to start and execute. The vendor who provided us this application and Dongle, does not make or work with these dongles any more, since they are very old technology, and would not help us in this aspect.p  pSo my question is  is it possible to read the security code from this Dongle and store it in a file or something on the PC. We also do not have the source code of the application. Can we change the call in the application to read the security key from this file instead of trying to read it from the Dongle attached to the printerparallel port.p  pSorry for the vague question but we are very desperate to get help on this problem as out application has 16bit code and it would not be supported by Windows 7 which is 64 bit.

Negative 859 pUPDATEDp  pI am updating this post because I did some more reading and decided to reimplement my solution.  p  pOriginal Problem I have a class with static properties and one Property that is a dynamic collection of properties via a dictionary.  I want to databind my class to a wpf datagrid where each static property should be a column and each dictionary entry should be a column in the grid.  p  pAfter doing some more research, I decided to implement a PropertyBag class that will contain my Dictionary of properties and values. Almost everything is working now.  I have my grid being displayed with all the correct columns and the static property values are being applied correctly.p  pHowever, now I am not able to get any of the values from the dictionary to be applied to the grid, and I am not sure where to go from here. p  pMore infop  pMy database has 3 tables, a plate, a category, and a categoryplateassociation table.  Each plate can have 0 to many categories.  For now, I am populating each plate with all the categories and setting the strings to empty.  Then, when an association is returned between a plate and category, I am setting the real value on the specific category name.  This all happens before the grid is created.p  pProperty Bagp  precodepublic class PropertyBag      private readonly Dictionaryltstring, stringgt values  new Dictionaryltstring, stringgt      public string this[string key]              get                       string value             values.TryGetValuekey, out value             return value                  set                      if value  null values.Removekey             else values[key]  value                codepre  pRevised Plate classp  precode[TypeDescriptionProvidertypeofPlateTypeDescriptionProvider] public class Plate  INotifyPropertyChanged      public int ID     private string name     private string status     private string creator     private Uri location     private string description      public Plate              CustomCategories  new PropertyBag           public PropertyBag CustomCategories  get set       public string Name              get  return name         set                      name  value             NotifyPropertyChangedName                    public string Status              get  return status          set                      status  value             NotifyPropertyChangedStatus                    public string Creator              get  return creator          set                      creator  value             NotifyPropertyChangedCreator                    public Uri Location              get  return location          set                      location  value             NotifyPropertyChangedLocation                    public string Description              get  return description          set                      description  value             NotifyPropertyChangedDescription                    public static Plate ConvertDataPlateToBusinessPlateTestPlate dataPlate              var plate  new Plate                                                      Name  dataPlate.Name,                              Status  dataPlate.Status,                             Creator  dataPlate.Creator,                              Description  dataPlate.Description,                              Location  new UridataPlate.Location                                  return plate           public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged      private void NotifyPropertyChangedstring propertyName              if PropertyChanged  null                      PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgspropertyName                codepre  pRevised CustomTypeDescriptorp  precodepublic override PropertyDescriptorCollection GetProperties              return GetPropertiesnull           public override PropertyDescriptorCollection GetPropertiesAttribute[] attributes              var properties  new ArrayList         foreach PropertyDescriptor propertyDescriptor in base.GetPropertiesattributes                      ifpropertyDescriptor.PropertyType.EqualstypeofPropertyBag                              Static list of all category names                 var categoryNames  Categories.GetAll                 foreach var categoryName in categoryNames                                      properties.Addnew PropertyBagPropertyDescriptorcategoryName                                           else                              properties.AddpropertyDescriptor                                var props  PropertyDescriptor[]properties.ToArraytypeofPropertyDescriptor         return new PropertyDescriptorCollectionprops      codepre  pRevised PropertyDescriptorp  precode    public class PropertyBagPropertyDescriptor  PropertyDescriptor      public PropertyBagPropertyDescriptorstring name  basename, null           public override bool CanResetValueobject component              return true           public override object GetValueobject component              return PropertyBag component[Name]           public override void ResetValueobject component              PropertyBagcomponent[Name]  null           public override void SetValueobject component, object value              PropertyBag component[Name]  string value           public override bool ShouldSerializeValueobject component              return PropertyBagcomponent[Name]  null           public override Type ComponentType              get  return typeofPropertyBag            public override bool IsReadOnly              get  return false            public override Type PropertyType              get  return typeofstring        codepre  psimple ViewModelp  precode public TestPlateAdministratorViewModel              CommandAggregator  new TestPlateAdministratorCommandAggregatorthis         LoadData           public static TestPlateAdministratorCommandAggregator CommandAggregator  get set      public ObservableCollectionltPlategt TestPlates get set       private static void LoadData              CommandAggregator.LoadPlatesCommand.Executenull         CommandAggregator.LoadCategoriesCommand.Executenull       codepre

Negative 859 pIm having a difficult time figuring out where to start looking for a solution to a problem, I was hoping someone could give me some guidance, heres what Im trying to dop  p1 I want to be able to have multiple devices communicate and update data to each other over wifi andor wired connectionp  p2 I want to be able to limit logins, user 1 can only log into one device at a time. EG if user one is logged into device 1, if they attempt to log into device 2 the login fails. What is a good way to keep track of thisp  p3 If user 1 updates a piece of data on device 1, user 2 currently logged into device 2 should be able to see that update, as should user 3 on device 3, ad infinitum.p  p4 One thing that I also have to figure out is how to allow each device to function if the network goes down independently, then updates each device as the network is restored. Data integrity has to be maintained in some way. The only way Im familiar with is a MasterSlave architecture where each slave device sends their updates to the master device and that dictates which one is committed based on the time of the transaction.  p  pIve considered implementing something like a Token Ring, where each device on the network that is running my application broadcasts a signal that its available and sequentially passes a token that either updates data, or says who is logged in at that terminal. My worries about this is it wont scale well with too many terminals. Im also not sure of how to broadcast an application recognization so that each application on the network can recognize others that need to be updated as anything changes. I have little experience setting up communication between devices and I just need a place to start.p

Negative 859 pIm working on a WPF Application where there are multiple list views.p  pI get all the data necessary for all the list view at once. However, my requirement is such that, the list view that has less number of items should get loaded first and displayed to the user before the next list view starts getting loaded.p  pSo basically, I need the ListView1 to be loaded and made visible to the user first. Then ListView2 starts getting loaded and when complete is made visible to the user. In other words, all the list views are loaded when the page is loaded 9one by one and each one is made visible right after it is loaded.p  pI tried using something equivalent to DoEvents a hrefhttpwww.cnblogs.comshevaarchive20060824485790.html relnofollowhttpwww.cnblogs.comshevaarchive20060824485790.htmla But it did not work.p  pJust to clarify When the page is loaded and items for lv1 are populated and lv1 is shows with the items, but lv2 and lv3 will be EMPTY. Then the items for lv2 is loaded and we should see lv1 and lv2 populated with their items. At this time lv3 should be visible and empty. Then well get the items for lv3 and all the list views will be populated. All of them should be visible right after the first one is loaded with its items. Can anyone suggest any way to achieve thisp  pThanks.p

However, my problem is creating these objects and their relationships as fast as possible without using ridiculous amounts of RAM when I receive a new dataset from the server.p  pThe problem is associating the posts with the users. The normal way to do it is to basically write codepost.user  usercode However, this requires that I have the codeusercode loaded from the disk.p  pMy current plan is to load all users, fault them and create a NSDictionary that maps the PKs to the actual objects. That way I can quickly find out the user I need to associate with the post. However, this solution seems a bit complex for something that should essentially be a rather trivial operation.p

If maximumAge is set to 0, the implementation   must immediately attempt to acquire a new position object.

Negative 859 pAbstract Descriptionp  pI have a set of strings, call it the active set, and a set of sets of strings  call that the possible set.  When a new string is added to the active set, sets from the possible set may suddenly be subsets of the active set because the active set lacked only that string to be a superset of one of the possibles.  I need an algorithm to efficiently find these when I add a new string to the active set.  Bonus points if the same data structure allows me to efficiently find which of these possible sets are eminvalidatedem no longer a subset when a string is emremovedem from the active set.p  pThe reason I framed the problem described below in terms of sets and subsets of strings in the abstract above is that the language Im writing this in Io is dynamically typed.  Objects do have a type field but it is a string with the name of the object type in it.p  pBackgroundp  pIn my game engine I have emGameObjectsem which can have several types of emRepresentationem objects added to them.  For instance if a GameObject has physical presence it might have a PhysicsRepresentation added to it or not if its not a solid object.  It might have various kinds of GraphicsRepresentations added to it, such as a mesh or particle effect and you can have more than one if you have multiple visual effects attached to the same game object.p  pThe point of this is to separate subsystems, but you cant completely separate everything  for instance when a GameObject has both a PhysicsRepresentation and a GraphicsRepresentation, something needs to create a 3rd object which connects the position of the GraphicsRepresentation to the location of the PhysicsRepresentation.  To serve this purpose while still keeping all the components separate, I have emInteractionem objects.  The Interaction object encapsulates the crosscutting knowledge about how two system components have to interact.p  pBut in order to protect GameObject from having to know too much about Representations and Interactions, GameObject just provides a generic registry where Interaction prototype objects can register to be called when a particular combination of Representations is present in the GameObject.  When a new Representation is added to the GameObject, GameObject should look in its registry and activate just those Interaction objects which are newly enabled by the presence of the new Representation, plus the existing Representations.p  pIm just stuck on what data structure should be used for this registry and how to search it.p  pErratap  pThe sets of strings are not necessarily sorted, but I can choose to store them sorted.p  pAlthough an Interaction most commonly will be between two Representations, I do not want to limit it to that I should be able to have Interactions that trigger with 3 or more different representations, or even interactions that trigger based on just 1 representation.p  pI want to optimize this for the case of making it as fast as possible to addremove representations.p  pI will have many active sets each game object has an active set, but I have only one possible set the set of all registered interaction types.  So I dont care how long it takes to build the data structure that represents the possible set, because it only needs to be done once provided the algorithm for comparing different active sets is nondestructive of the possible set data structure.p

Negative 859 pI have a templated class that I am using to provide a method that will use codeboostlexicalcastcode to cast its codestdstringcode parameters to the type specified in the template, only if the lexical cast is possible. Currently to check if its possible Im simply checking to see if codeoperatorgtgtcode is defined for the type in question. Here is a contrived example that basically illustrates what Im doingp  precodetemplate lttypename ArgType, class Enable  voidgt MyHelperClass     void Foo ArgType argamp, stdstring strArg    not castable do nothing   template lttypename ArgTypegt MyHelperClassltArgType, boostenableifltboosthasrightshiftltstdistream, ArgTypegt gttypegt     void Foo ArgType argamp, stdstring strArg        arg  boostlexicalcastltArgTypegtstrArg  cast string arg to ArgType      codepre  pSo far this works fine for my code all of the types that would fail a lexical cast end up with the first version and all others end up with the second, at least for the types my code is using this on. What Im worried about is that Im basically making the assumption that as long as the target type is InputStreamable then lexicalcast will not fail. The a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1480dochtmlboostlexicalcastsynopsis.htmlboostlexicalcast.synopsis.lexicalcast relnofollowboost documentationa for lexicalcast outlines some other requirements, which I should probably be checking as well but rather than creating a complex codeenableifcode and use codemplandcode to string together a bunch of these conditions, I was wondering is there a way to use SFINAE to just test directly whether that call to codelexicalcastcode would fail for the types given, and match the specialized template only if it wouldnt failp  pIve only ever seen examples for testing the existence of a function or operator, but never to test if a call to a templated function with a given type would produce an error.p

Negative 859 pI have a railsbackbone project that generates jst.ejs templates.p  pId like to include some view helpers within there, but Im having a helluva time figuring out how to include either EJS or JST functions into that template file.

Negative 859 pi apologize in advance for not being very precise, as a i dont know the mathematical expression for what i want. p  pi am using matplotlib to analyze a large dataset. What i have now is a distribution of x,y points. I want to find out the cases in which the x values of my function are the same, but y differs the greatest. So if i plot it, one part of the cases is at the top of my graph, the other is the botton of the graph. p  pSo how do i get the pointsx,y, x,y where fxy and fxy and yymax p  pcheersp

The event changes the scope, repopulates the codestaffcode List, then runs the above again.p  pEverythings working fine as is, but what Id like to do is know if the user has changed ddlStaff so that I can basically do something like code Selected  x  UserSelectedStaff  DefaultStaff code. Is there a built in way to do this Or do I just need to remember what the last selected staff I sent out was in the session or viewstate and then compare it the actual selected staff when it comes backp  pstrongEdit to clarifystrong My intention is that I can send ddlStaff out populated with staff, and with the default staffmember already selected. If the user selects a staffmember, and then changes the higherlevel scope dropdown, Id like for the postback to not overwrite the userchosen staffmember unless of course that staffmember doesnt exist within the new scope. If the user hasnt changed the staffmember, however, I should overwrite it with the default for the new scope.p

Negative 859 pI have an iPhone app problem thats been bugging me for a few days and it really doesnt seem like it should be this difficult so Im sure Im missing something obvious.  I have researched plenty of forum discussions on similar topics but nothing that actually addresses this issue, specifically.p  pTo be clear, if there is some piece of documentation or some other source that I should research, please point me in the right direction.p  pHere goes...p  pI have a list of items that I display to the user within a table uitableview.  The cell uitableviewcell for each item is custom and contains an image and a Like button uibutton.  As expected, for each item in the the table, the user can click the Like button or ignore it.  The like button calls a separate process to update the server.  Simple, rightp  pSo, here is the issuep  pWhen the Like button is clicked on a particular cell, the Selected state works fine but the moment you scroll the cell out of view, other random cells in the table show the Like button as Selected even though they were never touched.  Because the cells are reused, for obvious performance reasons, I understand why this could happen.  What I dont understand is why my approach see code below would not override or reset the buttons state the way I think it should.  For brevity, I am only including the relevant code here hopefully formatted properlyp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      static NSString CellIdentifier  MyCustomCell     MyCustomViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier]  if cell  nil      cell  [[MyCustomViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier]     cell.selectionStyle  UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone       NSString myRating  [[self.dataArray objectAtIndexindexPath.row] valueForKeymyrating]       Create the Like button     UIButton likeButton  [[UIButton alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake260, 68, 40, 40]     [likeButton setImage[UIImage imageNamedthumbsUp] forStateUIControlStateNormal]     [likeButton setImage[UIImage imageNamedthumbsUpSelected] forStateUIControlStateSelected]     if myRating  9          [likeButton setSelectedYES]          [likeButton setTitle9 forStateUIControlStateNormal]     [likeButton setTagindexPath.row]     [cell.contentView addSubviewlikeButton]     [likeButton addTargetself actionselectorlikeButtonPressed forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]      return cell    voidlikeButtonPressedUIButton sender        Changed the Selected state on the button     UIButton button  UIButton sender     button.selected  button.selected       Create a new object with the users rating and then replace it in the dataArray     NSString ratingText  sender.titleLabel.text         NSMutableArray myMutableArray  [[self.dataArray objectAtIndexrow] mutableCopy]     [myMutableArray setValueratingText forKeymyrating]     [self.dataArray replaceObjectAtIndexrow withObjectmyMutableArray]  codepre  pSo, Ive been through many iterations of this but I cant seem to get the state of the button to show the Selected image for those items that are Liked and keep the normal image for those items that have not been Liked.p  pAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 859 pI want to make database queries in my Jersey REST webapp. The ideal situation would be to find a way where the database connection is initialised once at the first app run. Afterwards I only get the instance of DAOFactory object in my REST class and make the queries in the methods. I am using mysql connector. Is there a way to find a way to do it in Jersey In JSF it was possible  I just used an applicationscoped bean when I run the code. Moreover it would be good if I could access the codeServletContextcode object inside this method cause I would like to use its codegetResourceAsStreamcode method to read the database connection parameters from codeWEBINFdao.propertiescode file. But the only once per app initialisation is the crucial part here.p

Negative 859 pI have a website that basically extract the opengraph metadatas from links in a database.. and now I have to create a verify code to check if the link that the user is sending through a submit box to my website database is opengraph friendly. I need to do a kind of a test in the link and see if it has at least the meta propertyogimage on its source code, and then avoid the submission of links that will not work properly. Im also using a recaptcha to avoid spammers and I was thinking that I could use the same verify code of the recaptcha to do this opengraph test. Anyone have any idea of how can I do thisp

Negative 859 pI am writing a Linux driver that allocates some memory and the user space application codemmapcodes that memory.p  pNow I am writing the exit handler for that module, and I am trying to figure out what are some safe assumptions.p  pFirst of all, is it safe to assume when a kernel module exit handler is called that all of the memory is unmapped whether by the application or by the kernel  Or do I have to do a manually unmap in the kernel driver before freeing the memoryp  pI ask this since the kernel should know if the module is exiting and the kernel also handles the unmapping process.  If the kernel handles the unmapping before the exit handler is called, then I can just free up the memory.  If this is true and if the userspace application tried to access that memory, then the application would segmentation fault.  This would be because the virtual addresses either no longer point to valid physical memory or the process does not have permission to access the virtual addresses on that page Assuming the kernel unmapped the memory.  The same would occur if the kernel driver unmapped the memory.  Is this truep

Negative 859 pWe have a Scenario wherein we need to delete a record before updating it.  While deleting, we would also have to delete all the records from the Child tables associated with a foreign key.  And we would have to reinsert all the records with the update to the parent table.p  pThe reason why we would like to do this, is to bring the records which are being updated to the New Partitions in our Oracle database.  This helps us to prunedelete the old partitions over time easily, since they are not being used solely for maintenance purposes.  p  pIs there an easy way in Hibernate to achieve this  We would like to do an CascadeDelete on the Parent record, and Reinsert them with the updates all the parent and child records back into the database.

Negative 859 pI am developing a multiplayer game with Box2D physics for iOS. The multiplayer is using lockstep method as usual. The game updates physics world fixedtimely. There is no desync among iOS devices with same CPU.p  pHowever, when testing with new iOS devices with Apple A6 chip, desync happened. Viewing my log file gives me the impression that desync happens quite fast and it was probably because of some floating point operation that I could not find out which yet.p  pI can guarantee that only Box2D is the only module needed to be synchronized in the design of the game, and all mutliplayer commands and inputs are not outofsync according to my log.p  pI have tried changing all transcendental functions sinf, cosf, pow, sqrtf, atan2f to double version, but without any luck.p  pIs there any way to force Apple A6 treating floating point numbers as same as Apple A5 like some compiler optionsp  pI will really appreciate any answer.p

But I would need to run a loop to count through all the present fields where the name is codememberNamecode, followed by a number. Rather than stopping at the first empty field, run through them all. If the value is  blank do nothing. If its got a value then insert it into my table.p  precodeltcfquery datasourceexampledatasource nameinsertbandmembersgt   Insert Into membersmembersname   Values memberNamei ltcfquerygt codepre

Negative 859 pI know at first this sounds evil, but Im not trying to be at all.  Im only trying to get the users Facebook ID without having to connect to FB.  I basically want to unique the user on my site by their social id.p  pIf you use facebooks comments feature, without being connected, they have your ID and picture. The picture is easy because its just a URL, but that ID, how do they get itp  pObviously they use iFrames, and maybe thats where the story ends. Because of cross domain scripting I cant get into that iFrame to grab the ID.  This is a case where its so close yet so far away. I can get there via dev tools but I cant get that ID via JS.p  pSo the question is, does anyone know a way to get a users facebook ID without having to connect to facebook first.p  pThanksp

Negative 859 pIn my app I have to provide the ability to add, move, resize and remove some views, like a launcher does. It worked fine until now, but now I want some of these views to display a video, streamed in real time like a webcam.p  pI would like my video not to rebuffer when I change the screen orientation, so I am trying to use the androidconfigChangesorientationscreenSize attribute.p  pIt works in most cases but... The problem is that I have to get the new size either when the screen orientation change, or in the onResume function. It is a bit tricky, and it doesnt always work For example, if I am in landscape mode, and I receive a call, Android automatically switch in portrait mode, and when I come back to my app, it stays in portrait but give me the landscape screen size.p  pI have tried to use both addOnLayoutChangeListener and getViewTreeObserver.addOnGlobalLayoutListener, both failed.p  pI guess it may be buggy in several other situations, so I thought that the perfect behavior would be to have the normal behavior eg destroy and recreate my activity in onResume if the orientation changed, and resize my views manually only when the orientation change.p  pSo my questions are p  ul lipDo you think it is a good idea to try do get this behavior pli lipWhat is the best way to destroy and recreate the activity  Just calling onDestroyonCreate  in onResume if the orientation changed  Or manually set all my pointers to null, and be really careful with memory leakspli ul  pThank you in advancep

Negative 859 pSay I have a 2d world full of different moving entities. The world is a simple matrix, and each tile can only contain one entity at a time. The world will updated in ticks, where all entities will have the option of taking different actions. Anyhow, Im trying to get some ideas for graceful ways to deal with collision situationsp  pFor instance, lets say I have an entity at 5,4 and I want to move it to 5,3. When I check to see if it can legally move there, I find an entity already in 5,3. However, later on while updating this tick, the entity in 5,3 moves to 5,2. So the first entity really should have been able to move, if the second had moved first. There are various situations like this two entites trying to move to eachother squares, four entites all in a clump trying to each move to another occupied square in a circular fashion. And also situations like two entites trying to move to the same square different kind of situation. p  pSo, in a tickbased 2d world like this, what might be some good ways to handle how entities interact while moving I have some ideas, but want to try and approach the problem from some different angled.  p

Negative 859 pIm dealing with pandas DataFrames in which columns may contain strings representing numbers, may contain unexpected nonnumeric characters, and the numbers represented by the strings may be of float or int type. For example, the DataFrame may contain something like 625,452,242.95 for a float of 625452242.95 or 53.000.395 for an int equal to 53000395. The DataFrames are being read from a CSV file, and may be quite large.p  pWhat is the most efficient way to convert all such strings in a DataFrame to the appropriate numeric types Thank you.p
Negative 859 pSo this question is related to an old one of mine a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10396552doineedtoreusethesameakkaactorsystemorcanijustcreateoneeverytimDo I need to reuse the same Akka ActorSystem or can I just create one every time I need oneap  pI asked a question about the lifecycle of actors, and I knew something was wrong in my mind, but couldnt phrase it correctly. Hopefully I can now .p  pHeres the situation. I want to test actors that have dependencies to other components and actors, so I went about composing my actors in bootstrap time Im using scalatra but however you bootstrap your app. I therefore have something like thisp  precodetrait DependencyComponent    val dependency  Dependency   trait ActorComponentA extends Actor with DependencyComponent     val actorB  ActorRef    trait ActorComponentB extends Actor with DependencyComponent   codepre  pOk, so now I can test my actors by extending the traits and providing mock dependencies, all good. And I can bootstrap my app like sop  h2Bootstraph2  precodeval system  ActorSystem val actorA  system.actorOfProps[DefaultActorA]  class DefaultActorB extends ActorComponentB        val dependency  new RealDependency    class DefaultActorA extends ActorComponentA       val dependency  new RealDependency      val actorB  context.actorOfProps[DefaultActorB].withRouterRoundRobinRouternrOfInstances  100   codepre  pCool, Im happy , now I can use the actorSystem and actorA within my app, and it has a 100 actorB routed to pass work to. So when actorA decideds that the work is done, its my understanding that it should broadcast to the routed actors to shutdown. At this point when another request comes in actorA can no longer send messages to the router because all its actors are dead. p  pIf I wasnt setting this up at boot time then actorA and its dependencies could be created when needed in my app. But that is very much like newing up on object in DI world. In order to test I would end up overriding the places where the actors were created. p  pScalatra docs are suggesting creating my actors at boot time, so I feel that I am missing somehting here. Any help appreciated.p  pCheers, Chris. p  h2EDITh2  pIve 1 both futurechimp and cmbaxter as these both seem valid but slightly conflicting. So this is an open comment to both of you. p  pSo cmbaxter am I right in thinking that your suggesting never calling stop on the routed actors and just maintaining a pool of them for use by ALL requests. And futurechimp, your suggesting having the servlet instantiate the actors per request and killing them at the end of there lifecycle. Rightp  pIt seems like perrequest will spawn more actors but dispose of them. Where the poll will have only a limited set for all requests in which case is there a potential bottle neck to this approachp  pI guess basically, Im asking if my assumptions are correct and if so what are the advantage and disadvantages to both approaches p
Negative 859 pIve got a strange Problem, but first some descriptionp  pFirst there is a TreeTable  View. In each row, there is a dropdown menu in 1 column.  The dropdown is realized via HTML  tag. And here is my problemp  ul liIf I click with a normal click on the expand button nothing happens.li liIf I click with an right click, than the menu will expand. Afterwards it works with a normal left click, too. li ul  pSo I think the reason for this problem are the event listeners of the TreeTable. So I already added an ifcondition and added some logging. The click is always logged, but the dropdown is still react like Ive described above.p  pI thought i could call the expand Method, but as far as I know, there isnt any way to toggle the expand a  dropdown, without using jQuery. NOTE Refactoring the size isnt a good solutionp  pSo Im at the end of my knowledge, maybe one of you knows an solution. Thank You. p

I removed a lot of code abstract methods etc. just to find what the problem is and I ended up with these really simple classes and I still have the same problem.p  precodepublic abstract class MyObject       private boolean New     private boolean Modified      public MyObject          New  true           public boolean isNew          return New           protected void setNewboolean value          New  value           protected boolean isModified          return Modified           protected void setModifiedboolean value          Modified  value         public abstract class MyItemBase extends MyObject       private Long Id     private String Description      public MyItemBase          super           public Long getId          return Id           public void setIdLong id          Id  id           public String getDescription          return Description           public void setDescriptionString description          Description  description         public class MyItem extends MyItemBase implements Serializable       private static final long serialVersionUID  2875901021692711701L      public MyItem          super        codepre  pI have two Activities, ActivityA with a button to call ActivityB as follows.p  precodepublic class ActivityA extends Activity       Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitya          Button btn  Button findViewByIdR.id.button         btn.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener               Override             public void onClickView v                  Intent intent  new IntentgetApplicationContext,                         ActivityB.class                  MyItem item  new MyItem                 item.setIdlong 1                 item.setDescriptiontest                  intent.putExtraMyItem, Serializable item                 startActivityForResultintent, 1                                public class ActivityB extends Activity       Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activityb          MyItem item  MyItem getIntent.getSerializableExtraMyItem         TextView findViewByIdR.id.text.setTextitem.getDescription        codepre  pSo when I receive MyItem from the second activity, with no errors at all, both properties Id and Description are null. Actually its a new object because the New property is true. Now if I try to get the object exactly after I put it in the intent in the first Activity like thatp  precodeintent.putExtraMyItem, Serializable item MyItem newItem  MyItem intent.getSerializableExtraMyItem startActivityForResultintent, 1 codepre  pit works fine. newItem has all the properties with the correct values.p  pAny ideasp  pThanx in advance everybodyp

Negative 859 pSo I have an Activity A and an Activity B. I want Activity A to be able to navigate to Activity B with the press of a button. That works, but when I use the up navigationthe home button in the action bar to navigate back to Activity A, onCreate is called again and the old information that the user typed in is lost. p  pIve seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11347161oncreatealwayscalledifnavigatingbackwithintentonCreate always called if navigating back with intenta, but they used Fragments, and Im hoping not to have to redesign the entire app to use fragments. Is there any way I can stop onCreate from being called every time Activity A becomes active againp
Negative 859 pI have about 1000 IP address.

It should find the subrange for the given IP address, so if I call codesearch91.99.98.249code, the search function should show the record that netid is 91.99.98.240 and broadcast field is 91.99.98.255.p  pHow can I do thatp

Negative 859 pHow do I get started with mocking a web service in PHP Im currently directly querying the web APIs in my unit testing class but it takes too long. Someone told me that you should just mock the service. But how do I go about that Im currently using PHPUnit. What I have in mind is to simply save a static result json or xml file somewhere in the file system and write a class which reads from that file. Is that how mocking works Can you point me out to resources which could help me with this. Is PHPUnit enough or do I need other tools If PHPUnit is enough what part of PHPUnit do I need to check out Thanks in advancep

Negative 859 pI am new with the concept if binary trees. I have been stuck at a question for many days. It is to find if a given tree is a binary tree or a fully binary tree or neither of the two.p  pI have thought of many algorithm but none of them fulfill each and every case. I tried google but there was no proper solution.p  pI thought of using Level Order Traversal Technique but couldnt come up with how to know thier levels after all the nodes have been inserted in the queue.p  pFor the Fully Binary tree I tried counting if the degree of all the nodes are 0 or 2 but then if the tree has some intermediate node with degree this logic is also wrong.p  pI have made a tree using a linked list, The basic  Left Child, Right Child Relationship way.p  pFor the fully binary tree I do a inorder traverl and checked the degree if 0 or 2, but its wrong cause if theres a node at some earlier level with degree 0 then also then output comes true.p  pFor the complete binary tree i couldnt come up with anything proper.p  pThank You.p  pAnd I am using C, so if the logic uses pointers then its alright.p

Negative 859 pSo, Im creating a download manager, and Ive designed every bit specifically so that it can be shut down at any second without giving it the time to clean up. However, I cant seem to find a way to kill my downloader threads.

Negative 859 pI am making a game in Java. Basically, I have two different planes of updating that I need to take care of the. The base layer is the actual game painting itself. It is simply a JPanel that covers the entire JFrame, and is drawn to using its Graphics object.p  pI use a fixed timestep to take care of these first graphical updates. I have overwritten the codepaintComponentcode method to do absolutely nothing, as I have written a custom coderenderfloat interpolationcode method that takes care of that, as to prevent unwanted updates.p  pHowever, this panel can take no input beyond primitive mouse clicks and keyboard input. I need the ability to create various menus, text boxes, etc, that are also on the screen. Like various abilities, or even the Menu button that usually appears in the upper left corner of most games.p  pTo take care of that input, such as creating buttons, I have a second JPanel that has codesetOpaquefalsecode applied to it. Then I create various Swing components that I might need, such as a JButton.p  pTo contain the two JPanels, I use a JLayeredPane, and set their layers appropriately, as seen below. This way the input layer emshouldem always be on top of the actual game layer.p  pThe code below shows how I create and add the Swing components to each other. codeaddLoginDialogcode is a method that adds a Swing component for the login. It has been tested and works properly, and isnt the problem.p  precodeprivate void initComponents      This code is inside of the JFrame     wholePane  new JLayeredPane     addwholePane     guiPanel  new GUIPanel     guiPanel.setOpaquefalse     gamePanel  new RPGPanel     gamePanel.setOpaquefalse     wholePane.addgamePanel, JLayeredPane.DEFAULTLAYER     wholePane.addguiPanel, JLayeredPane.POPUPLAYER     guiPanel.addLoginDialog  codepre  pSo when I run the code, I get horrible flickering. This is the code that is run from my fixed timestep 60 times per second.p  precodepublic void handleRepaint      I dont use repaint for the game drawing so I can be sure that fps is controlled.     Graphics g  gamePanel.getGraphics     gamePanel.renderg     g.dispose     wholePane.repaint  codepre  pThe problem is, I think, that the two different systems of updating the screen are clashing. The standard codepaintComponentcode system is great for more static screens, but when I need to update consistently and keep track of the fps, I cant have updates going off randomly.p  pHowever, for the input layer, I only want to update as Swing normally does. When the mouse moves over a button, when I component is moved or is resized, etc.p  pAlso, note the way the screen flickers The Background image goes blank and then comes back again repeatedly. The input panel is always there, but is actually painted behind the game drawing, which shouldnt happen, because it is put in the default layer. The reason I know it isnt completely disappearing is because the game painting is partially transparent, so I can see underneath it, and the buttons I added are still there.p  pMy main question is, how can I stop the flickering strongWhy is the game drawing being drawn on top of the input components when the game drawing is being done on the Panel that is in a lower layer in the JLayeredPanestrong And I supposed most importantly, what is causing the flickering Thank you for any help.p

Negative 859 pCan someone explain when rvalue references are preferred over const lvalue references when working as function parametersp  pstrongBackgroundstrong I was trying to pass a const pointer into a function. Since I have to consider the cases in which a local pointer is passed in and in which a temporary is passed in say from a function call return, I have two choices the parameter could either be declared asp  precodevoid fooT const constamp const lvalue ref to const ptr codepre  por p  precodevoid fooT const ampamp rvalue ref to const ptr codepre  pBut this rvalue reference cannot be bound to a local variable which is of lvalue type. But I did remember Scott Meyers coined the term universal reference to refer to rvalue reference. This confuses me more. So my question is, since the first declaration could deal with both cases, when would the second one using rvalue reference be preferredp  pstrongNotestrong In the first approach, the other formsp  precodevoid fooconst const T amp  void fooconst T constamp  codepre  pdidnt work. I guess the reason is that in the latter two I was not consistent in the place where the const qualifiers are put into please correct me if Im wrong.p

Negative 859 pactually Im just starting to play around spring mvc in webapp and I have tumble across spring security which handles the authentication and session. My question is how does it handles session and can I create my own session id reference for spring security to use. I did use spring security but somewhat I feel blinded by its process. Another thing is that can I add my own session service that I can control more if its implementable can you give me an insight in where can I start.. Furthermore Im sorry for my English and if it is a duplicate question, though I think that topics concerning with spring security doesnt satisfy what i had in mind... Thanks for the feedback...p

Negative 859 pI am working on a WPF application that supports basic touch events Not Manipulations. I am using Gong DragDrop to handle the drag and drop actions. The issue I ran into is described as followp  pIn the [Preview] Drop event using Gong DragDrop, I prompt the user to confirm the drop location, which user has to click on the Yes button or the No button to complete the drop or cancel the drop. I can use mouse to click on those two buttons, but no luck with touch events.p  pI have used spy to monitor the mouse events for the prompt dialog, which derived from a window. Both mouse events and the touch events were logged. p  pWhy did mouse worked and touch didnt Is there a way to get touch to workp

Can anyone enlighten me as to why this happensp  pI know I havent provided my code which might make it harder to answer this question, but Ive hacked a bunch of things together and it doesnt look very pretty so I doubt it would be useful and I am fairly certain that the only difference is the print statements.p  pEDITp  pSince people really wanted to see the code here is the relevant partp  precodelinkCallers  [Int], Int, Int, I.IntDisjointSet, IntMap Int gt [Int], Int, Int, I.IntDisjointSet, IntMap Int linkCallers [], x, y, us, im  [], x, y, us, im  linkCallers abr, x, y, us, im  if a  b     then r, x, y1, us, im      else if sameRep         then r, x1, y1, us, im          else r, x1, y1, us, im         where             ar  fst  I.lookup a us             br  fst  I.lookup b us               sameRep  case ar of                 Nothing gt False                  gt ar  br             as  ar gtgt flip lookup im             bs  br gtgt flip lookup im             totalSize  do                 asize lt as                  bsize lt bs                  return  asize  bsize             maxSize  convertMaybe as  convertMaybe bs             us  I.union a b  I.insert a  I.insert b  us             newRep  fromJust  fst  I.lookup a us              newRep  fromJust  fst  I.lookup b us              im  case ar of                 Nothing gt case br of                     Nothing gt im                     Just bk gt delete bk im                 Just ak gt delete ak  case br of                     Nothing gt im                     Just bk gt delete bk im             im  case totalSize of                   Nothing gt insert newRep maxSize im                 Just t gt insert newRep t im  startLinkingAux c,x,y,us,im  let t,x,,us,im  linkCallers c,x,y,us,im in     case fst  I.lookup primeMinister us gtgt flip lookup im gtgt return . gt990000 of         Just True gt x          gt startLinkingAux t codepre  pcodestartLinkingAuxcode used to look something like thisp  precodestartLinkingAux c,x,y,us,im  do     print c,x,y,us,im     let t,x,,us,im  linkCallers c,x,y,us,im in     case fst  I.lookup primeMinister us gtgt flip lookup im gtgt return . gt990000 of         Just True gt return x          gt startLinkingAux t codepre
Negative 859 pI recently changed the default encoding of our project to UTF8 to guarantee internationality. Now I am fixing some minor problems but there is one I came across which makes me suffer a bit.p  pThe original encoding was ISO88591 and the origin developer used the codegethtmltranslationtablecode function at different places.p  pAt PHP Version strong5.2.17strong emon which the application is runningem there have been only two arguments passed to this function table and quotestyle. The problem is, the function assumed ISO88591 as a default and ignores settings like codeinisetdefaultcharset, UTF8codep  pAt never PHP Versions, some Arguments were added to the function, one of them is codeencodingcode. In addition, strongUTF8strong replaced strongISO88591strong as a default inside the function.p  pI want to replace as less code as possible in the project to move from ISO88591 to UTF8 but I have to fix this because of wrong results.p  pHow can I get the new emrightem functionality of codegethtmltranslationtablecode as a fallback version with he same behavior in my project.p

Negative 859 pI was learning about the verilog stratified event queue. I had a minor doubt about the inactive events. I understood that they are carried out after all the active events are done with at the current simulation time. But I wrote a simple code to understand the concept better but the result I got is what confuses me. Here is the code I wrotep  precodemodule main      int x       initial begin          monitorx is 0d,x          0 x  5  inactive event         x  3  active event       end   endmodule codepre  pRESULT  x is 3.p  pAccording to my knowledge the 0 delay creates an inactive event and therefore the result should have been x is 5. But my understanding of the concept might be wrong somewhere. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.p

I will not cover this here, go check the docs on               NotificationManager.                             What you HAVE to do is call stopSelf after youve pushed your               notifications. This will               1 Kill the service so it doesnt waste precious resources               2 Call onDestroy which will release the wake lock, so the device                  can go to sleep again and save precious battery.                           protected void onPostExecuteString  result                   TODO Autogenerated method stub                 super.onPostExecuteresult                 stopSelf                 if resultnull ampamp result.equalstrue                                       new doWork2.executenull,null,null                                  else                                                                              This is deprecated, but you have to implement it if youre planning on           supporting devices with an API level lower than 5 Android 2.0.                   Override         public void onStartIntent intent, int startId              handleIntentintent                              This is called on 2.0 API level 5 or higher. Returning           STARTNOTSTICKY tells the system to not restart the service if it is           killed because of poor resource memorycpu conditions.                   Override         public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId              Log.dNotificationService, is in onStartCommand             handleIntentintent             return STARTNOTSTICKY                              In onDestroy we release our wake lock. This ensures that whenever the           Service stops killed for resources, stopSelf called, etc., the wake           lock will be released.                   public void onDestroy              super.onDestroy             mWakeLock.release                   public static class MyReciever extends BroadcastReceiver remove static later          Override         public void onReceiveContext arg0, Intent arg1               TODO Autogenerated method stub             If this BroadcastReceiver was launched through a ltreceivergt tag, then the object is no longer alive after returning from this function              TODO Autogenerated method stub              in our case intent will always be BOOTCOMPLETED, so we can just set              the alarm              Note that a BroadcastReceiver is NOT a Context.

Negative 859 pAfter a recent Azure Website update, it has broken some of our websites that run on Node.JS. After running some tests to see what kind of architecture the website is running on, it turned out to be running on IA64. And thats while the config is chosen as 32 bit, instead of 64 bit.  It would be fine, if changing it to 64 bit would also change the NodeJS to 64bit as well, but that stays in a 32bit format. p  pSo my question is this how can i ensure that both the OS and the NodeJS runtime runs on the same architecture. Either 32 or 64 bitp
Negative 859 pI need to solve a problem which entails comparing two matrices with the same number of columns. One of these is manipulated until the best match is obtained. The way I score the differences between the two matrices is quite convoluted and I still have to finalize it. What Im really interested at the moment in is finding a searchoptimization algorithm that works with positive integers only. Ive created a simple example with a simple function to maximise. Lets say I have a dataset D.   p  precode D lt data.framerbindc1,1,1,                        c1,1,0,c1,1,0,c1,1,0,c1,0,0,                        c0,0,0,c1,0,0,c1,0,0,c1,1,0,                        c1,0,0,c1,1,1,c1,1,0,c1,0,0,                        c1,0,0,c1,0,1 codepre  pI want to find which rearrangement of Dx gives me the lowest absolute difference.p  precodeDxltdata.framerbindc1,1,0,c1,0,0,c0,0,0,c1,1,0 codepre  pSo I could go through all the possible permutations using the function belowp  precode    librarycombinat     SPACE lt tas.data.framelistpermn13     f lt functionx       ifanyDuplicatedxgt0return0       DistltNA       for i in 1nrowD         Dist[i]ltsumabsDx[,x]tD[i,]      returnsumDist applySPACE,1,f codepre  pand get the right result.However this has 2 disadvantages for the data Im actually usingp  ol liI have to specify SPACE all the possible column orders and li licodeapplycode goes through each possible permutations and calculates my error score. li ol  pBoth A and B become computationally difficult as the number of columns in my matrix increases. I think even keeping all the possible permutations of the numbers 1 to 14 in one R session is impossible on most computers.p  pAn optimization algorithm I found is grid search. This starts to address A. It means that I dont have to specify SPACE i.e. all the possible permuatations, so its one step in the right direction, as I want to look at much larger datasets.p  precodelibraryNMOF gridSearchf, replistseq1,ncolD,ncolD codepre  pBut obviously this does not address B, as it goes through each possible iteration. What if my dataset was very large, lets say 15 or even more columnsp  pKeeping in mind that my parameters can only be positive integers i.e. they are column numbers, is there an R algorithm that would allow me to find the best column order or at least a good approximation within a reasonable amount of time e.g. 12 days, when Im dealing with much larger datasets This may look like a silly example, but it emulates very well the problem Im trying to solve. Ive tried codeoptimcode with codemethodSANNcode, but got nowhere. Unfortunately I have very little experience so do let me know if you think this is an unworkable problem. Just to start with an easier dataset few rows but lots of columns problem, do you think its possible to find the best column order as shown above for D2 by using some kind of clever optimization p  precode   D2 DltcbindD,D,D,D,D ncolD DxltcbindDx,Dx,Dx,Dx,Dx examples  fc1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 fc13,2,4,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,14,15 codepre  pEDIT My main interest is in understanding how to use optimization algorithms that use a series of unique positive integrals basically ranks in the search process, rather than solving this particular problem. Ive used a simple example in this case so that its easy to replicate, but the two datasets Im comparing often differ in number of rows and other aspects which Im not detailing here....the distance function Im building handles this well so understanding how to  apply an optimization algorithm e.g. Genetic Algorithm was suggested below to the function f above using D2 is therefore my main problem at the moment.p

Negative 859 pWe have a SQL table that stores the date an email was created and then another table that gives details about that email how long they spent writing the email, how long it was in a Draft mode etc.  The join between the two tables is through a key.p  pThe problem is, it only stores the date the email was created entered into the system and data is only written to the table when the email is completed sent.  So for yesterday, you may have 1000 emails completed that day, but their create date and time is varied.  Also the create date time column is only in one table.p  pMy method right now is to join the two tables, and in the where clause I calculate the completed date by adding the number of seconds of the email write time to the created date time.p  precode WHERE DATEADDs, ISNULLa.emailwritetime,0, b.CreateDateTime BETWEEN start AND end codepre  pstart and end are usually the previous dayp  pThe tables have millions of rows, so expectedly, this takes a while to run and its hitting the production server to pull the data.

Negative 859 pIm attempting to write some UI tests for a RequireJSbased Backbone application, utilizing FluentAutomation.SeleniumWebDriver and NUnit. The HTML page in question contains a typical codedatamaincode attribute for loading the RequireJS module for the application. My struggle is in properly detecting when the application is fully loaded with these tools the only thing Ive gotten to work consistently so far is using an explicit wait in seconds, like sop  precodeI.Openhttpmyapp     .Wait5     .Enterfoo.Ininput[nameusername]     .Enterbar.Ininput[namepassword]     .Clickbutton     .Wait5     .Expect.TextWelcome.Inwelcome codepre  pThis is less than ideal  my test as written above will always take at least 10 seconds to run, when in reality the app might be ready much faster than that. What Id like to be able to do is something like thisp  precodeI.Openhttpmyapp     .WaitUntil gt I.Assert.Existsinput[nameusername]     .Enterfoo.Ininput[nameusername]     .Enterbar.Ininput[namepassword]     .Clickbutton     .WaitUntil gt I.Assert.Existswelcome     .Expect.TextWelcome.Inwelcome codepre  pHowever, this doesnt work  using WaitUntil here actually seems to prevent the app from loading, for reasons unclear to me, as I simply receive timeout exceptions after the default wait period 30 seconds, stating that it was unable to locate the element in question within that timeframe.p  pI see that Selenium 2 provides a WebDriverWait for this kind of scenario, and possibly that would work here, but am unsure how I would use this within FluentAutomation and a quick search of the FluentAutomation code on GitHub doesnt seem to indicate its in use within the library.p  pWhat can I use in FluentAutomation to properly wait for a RequireJS module or DOM loaded by it to be readyp  pstrongAdditional detailsstrongp  pThis might not be a RequireJS compatibility problem at all. Ive looked further into the app and found that whats happening after the codeClickbuttoncode is actually a codewindow.location.replacecode  emnotem a RequireJS async module load. Its the one place in the app that this is occurring, apparently. So, is a codewindow.locationcode redirect a known scenario that would cause problems with codeWaitUntilcode, and is there an alternate approach aside from a simple codeWait5code that would properly handle thisp

Negative 859 pThis is related to the question I posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23294985qtcannotgetftptoopendirectorycorrectlyherea, but I hadnt gotten much visibility for that question so I wanted to ask in a more general way. I have a Qt 4.7 project that utilizes QFtp functionality. Until very recently we were using this with an FTP server that was vsftpd. Everything worked fine with it then. However, several days ago we moved the server to a new computer. All the contents are identical, but now it uses pureftpd instead of vsftpd. Since the move, none of my QFtp code works properly. Is there any known problems that arise when trying to use QFtp with this type of FTP server I cant find anything helpful online, and its rather frustrating not being able to find anything wrong with the code and yet having it not work. If anyone knows anything about this and could please share, Id appreciate it a lot. Thanksp

Negative 859 pI was thinking about a project on distribution management.p  pSuppose I have a central database that contains all the sales info of the products manufactured by my company. I populate this database with fresh data from the distributors on fixed regular intervals.p  pThere are other local databases installed on the systems of the distributors. There are certain interfaces made on Java EE Platform through which they access their respective local database. Every week the distributors have to sync their databases with ours. When a distributor syncs with the database, our sales records get updated.p  pThe distributor shouldnt show sales for a back date. But, suppose, a distributor does that by changing his system date to add a sales invoice of back date to his local database. Then he syncs his database with ours and that sale gets reflected in our database.p  pHow can I as a programmer prevent him from doing that provided that the interface is made by me.p

Negative 859 pI have fair bit of knowledge about paging. However, I was just wondering if I can create 2 different level of paging structures from same cr3. It is stupid. But just for kicks.p  pI am planning to create 3 level paging and 4 level paging on x8664 bit machine from same cr3. Page size for 3 level paging would be 2MB and for 4 level would be 4KB. p  pPage directory would decide if it is going to point to page frame or to page table which then point to page frame. p  pI know this sounds complete crazy but I am planning to do it as a test case for a small project. Is this approach workable on x8664 hardware p  pThanksp

Negative 859 pI would like to create a singleton instance of a class that is not involved in Jersey as a Resource or Service and yet would like its dependencies injected from the Jersey ServiceLocator.p  pI can register this class manually in my ResourceConfig constructor, the ResourceConfig is then passed in to the Grizzly factory method like sop  precodeResourceConfig resourceConfig  new DeviceServiceApplication  LOGGER.infoStarting grizzly2... return GrizzlyHttpServerFactory.createHttpServerBASEURI,                                                  resourceConfig, mServiceLocator codepre  pThe problem that remains is how to get a reference to the Jersey ServiceLocator so I can call createAndInitialize to get my object with dependencies injected.  I see in previous Jersey versions there were constructor variants that expect an ApplicationHandler, which of course provides access to the service locator how I initialise that is another matter.  You can also see I have tried passing in a parent ServiceLocator but of course the resolution happens from child  parent locator and not in the other direction so asking the parent for my object fails because the Jersey Contract and Service types arent visible here.p  pDo I need to use something other than GrizzlyHttpServerFactory   Do I give up and manually wire my singletons dependenciesp

Negative 859 pI am familiar with how forms authentication works with ASP.NET MVC its not too difficult.  But I am somewhat uncertain how authentication works with singlepage web applications.   Of course I can handle the initial login with a singlepage app, since there will be a postback and i can do the standard forms authentication.  But after that i will use ajax to access further webpage content.  p  pMy thought was to implement an interval function with Jquery to fire every 20 minutes or so which would ask for a password to reauthenticate.  What is the best practice for doing authentication for asp.net MVC single page web appsp

Negative 859 pIm running multiple processes in parallel and each of these processes read the same file in parallel. It looks like some of the processes see a corrupted version of the file if I increase the number of processes to  15 or so. What is the recommended way of handling such a scenariop  pMore details The file being read in parallel is actually a perl script. The multiple jobs are python processes, and each of them launch this perl script independently with different input parameters. When the number of jobs is increased, some of these jobs give errors that the perl script has invalid syntax which is not true. Hence, I suspect that some of these jobs read in corrupted versions of the perl script.p  pIm running all of this on a 32core machine.p

Negative 859 pContext In Python a main thread spawns a 2nd process using multiprocessing module and then launches a GUI using PyQt4. At this point the main thread blocks until the GUI is closed. The 2nd process is always processing and ideally should emit signals to specific slots in the GUI in an asynchronous manner.p  pQuestion Which approachtools are available in Python and PyQt4 to achieve that and how Preferably in a softinterrupt manner rather than polling.p  pAbstractly speaking, the solution I can think of is a toolhandler instantiated in the main thread that grabs the available slots from the GUI instance and connects with the grabbed signals from the 2nd process, assuming I provide this tool some information of what to expect or hard coded.

Negative 859 pI have a MySQL query that is doing a groupby and returning data in the following form  p  blockquote   pID  Boolean  Countp blockquote  pSometimes there isnt data in the table for one of the boolean states, so data for a single ID might be returned like thisp  blockquote   p1234  0  10p blockquote  pHowever I need it in this form for downstream analysisp  blockquote   p1234  0  10br   1234  1  0p blockquote  pwith an index on [ID, Boolean].p  pFrom querying Google and SO, it seems like getting MySQL to do this transform is a bit of a pain. Is there a simple way to do this in Pandas I havent been able to find anything useful in the docs or the Pandas cookbook.p  pYou can assume that Ive already loaded the data into a Pandas dataframe with no indexes.p  pThanks.p

Negative 859 pI am interested in generating a series of simple 3d scatterplots which include regression planes without interactions using the scatterplot3d function in R.  The following code generates almost what I am after with one problem in many cases the regression plane extends outside of the bounding box e.g. in this case, the corner nearest x, y and z 0.  I tried changing the axis limits to increase the box size, but this does not alter the axis ranges as specified which, according to the package documentation is an unfixed bug.

Negative 859 pThis is my problem in essence. In the life of a function, I generate some integers, then use the array of integers in an algorithm that is also part of the same function. The array of integers will only be used within the function, so naturally it makes sense to store the array on the stack.p  pThe problem is I dont know the size of the array until Im finished generating all the integers. p  pI know how to allocate a fixed size and variable sized array on the stack. However, I do not know how to grow an array on the stack, and that seems like the best way to solve my problem. Im fairly certain this is possible to do in assembly, you just increment stack pointer and store an int for each int generated, so the array of ints would be at the end of the stack frame. Is this possible to do in C thoughp

Negative 859 pCan you make an anonymous valp  pIm thinking to do something like thisp  precodecase class NumIterations[A]num Int case class Seed[A]seed A case class Manipulate[A]f A gt A . . .  def funcWithGobsOfImplicitArgs[A]   implicit numIterations NumIterations[A],            seed Seed[A],            manipulate Manipulate[A],            . . .

This makes experimenting with the function very convenient. I can play with one parameter at a time explicitly and let all the others be supplied implicitly.p  pIn this situation, it would be nice not to name the val, since the name takes up space in your head, and the full meaning of the val is provided by its type alone. When I only had one of these vals, I named it codecode, thinking that Scala would treat it as a val that never gets referred to explicitly. But when I named two vals codecode, Scala complained.p

Negative 859 pIm new to codeJavaScriptcode, and I am trying to wrap my head around codeconstructorcode functions and codeprototypescode. I have some experience with codeRubycode, so when learning new JS features I try to equate them to features they resemble in codeRubycode if at all possible. p  pTo me it seems like codeprototypescode are similar to codeRubycode classes. So my question is, is it possible to use the codeclassName.prototypecode command to add required properties to instances of the object, or is it necessary to reopen the codeclasscodecodeprototypecode like in codeRubycodep  pFor example, say I had the following codeconstructorcode function to create a Car prototypep  precodefunction Car make,model,year      this.make  make     this.model  model     this.year  year  codepre  pand I create a few carsp  precodemyCar  new Car Honda, Civic, 2015 anotherCar  new Car Ford, Focus, 2001  codepre  pNow lets say down the line I want new instances of Car to accept a codecolorcode parameter i.e. inherit a codecolorcode property from the parent. Is it possible to do something like the followingp  precodeCar.prototype.color  color codepre  psuch that when a new car is initialized, it will expect a color parameter to be passed That is, the Car codeconstructorcode function should now be but without me having changed it myselfp  precodefunction Car make, model, year, color      this.make  make     this.model  model     this.year  year     this.color  color  codepre  pand thus new instances should be initialized as followsp  precodeaThirdCar  new CarBMW,325,2008,black codepre  pOr, must I go back to the original codeconstructorcode function and manually make these changesp  pI understand that using codeclassName.prototype.methodNamecode is the primary use of this feature so that all instances share a single method rather than are initialized with their own. p  pMy interest in this functionality is for my own edification on what JS can and cannot do, as well as what can vs. should be done. p  pThank you.p

Negative 859 pI thought I found really working solution but it is not true 100. I am trying to retain some custom objects inside my fragment using setRetainInstance so the data doesnt get lost on configuration changes activity destroyed. I am following this instructions a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsresourcesruntimechanges.htmlRetainingAnObject relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsresourcesruntimechanges.htmlRetainingAnObjecta . We can readp  blockquote   pIf restarting your activity requires that you recover large sets of   data, reestablish a network connection, or perform other intensive   operations, then a full restart due to a configuration change might be   a slow user experience. Also, it might not be possible for you to   completely restore your activity state with the Bundle that the system   saves for you with the onSaveInstanceState callbackit is not   designed to carry large objects such as bitmaps and the data within   it must be serialized then deserialized, which can consume a lot of   memory and make the configuration change slow. In such a situation,   you can alleviate the burden of reinitializing your activity by   retaining a Fragment when your activity is restarted due to a   configuration change. This fragment can contain references to stateful   objects that you want to retain.p blockquote  pThis works great. If the activity gets destroyed like rotation I can check if the fragment is not null, and get the datap  precodeOverride public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState    iffragment  null     loadFragment     codepre  pAlsop  precodeprotected void onSaveInstanceState Bundle outState     super.onSaveInstanceStateoutState      store the data from the view in the retained fragment     fragment.update  codepre  pSo I basically save my object in my retained fragment and I can access to it doingp  precodefragment.getData codepre  pIt is basically an Activity where you can change several widgets, add info and it gets stored in the database when user clicks Save.p  pThe problem comes when you are in such an activity, you click for example the menu button of your phone so activity gets pausedstopped and you come back after about 30 minutes. Then I get a NullPointerException when trying to access fragment.getData.getSomething. Basically, the fragment is not null, but the data is.p  pWill the same happen using onSaveInstanceState  Although, the documentation doesnt recommend it for complex objects... What about saving it temporally to the database and remove it if necessary Is this a very bad solution Better ideasp

Why would coderefcode, something that has to do with memory location influence the calls to codeBarcodep  pConsider the following snippetp  precodestatic void Fooobject obj    static void Barref object obj    static void Main       Compiles     var a  new       Fooa       Does not compile     var b  new       Barref b       Compiles     object c  new       Barref c  codepre  pI see in the answers below suggestions on how to make the code compile, but thats not what Im after. Id like to know specifically why making it a coderefcode parameter prevents compilation when passing in an anonymous type to codeFoocode worked fine.p

Negative 859 pI have uploading photos with ajax, manipulations and uploading to s3 take a lot of time. I heard that its better to complete that tasks on background. My app need to wait while photos become uploaded. But if I choose background way then I will need to work with websockets or repeat ajax to check resultlinks to s3  Im not happy about this. Why is it too bad to make hard calculations right in controller foreground  Now I use TorqueboxJruby and as I understand it has perfect concurrency. Does it mean that waiting uploading to s3 will not take resources and all will work fine Please write about pros and cons of backfore ground in my situation. Thank youp

Negative 859 pIm working on a game using Game Maker Studio Professional v1.99.355 that needs to have both usermodifiable level geometry and AI pathfinding based on platformer physics. Because of this, I need a way to dynamically figure out which platforms can be reached from which other platforms in order to build a node graph I can feed to A.p  pMy current approach is, more or less, thisp  ol lipFor each platform consider each other platform in the level.pli lipFor each of those platforms, if it is obviously unreachable due to being higher than the maximum jump height, for example do not form a link and move on to next platform.pli lipIf a link seems possible, place an aicharacter instance on the starting platform and within the current step event simulate a jump attempt.pli ol  p3.a Repeat this jump attempt for each possible starting position on the starting platform.p  ol start4 lipIf this attempt is successful, record the data necessary to replicate it in real time and move on to the next platform.pli lipIf not, do not form a link.pli lipRepeat for all platforms.pli ol  pThis approach works, more or less, and produces a link structure that when visualised looks like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comIjaqMko.png relnofollowlinked platformsa Hyperlink because no rep.p  pIn this example the mostlyconcealed pink ghost in the lower right corner is trying to reach the black and white box. The light blue rectangles are just there to highlight where recognised platforms are, the actual platforms are the rows of grey boxes. Link lines are green at the origin and red at the destination.p  pThe huge, glaring problem with this approach is that for a level of only 17 platforms as shown above it takes over a second to generate the node graph. The reason for this is obvious, the yellow text in the screen centre shows us how long it took to build the graph over 24,000 simulated frames, each with attendant collision checks against every block  I literally just run the characters step event in a while loop so everything it would normally do to handle platformer movement in a frame it now does 24,000 times.p  pThis is, clearly, unacceptable. If it scales this badly at a mere 17 platforms then itll be a joke at the hundreds I need to support. Heck, at this geometric time cost it might take years.p  pIn an effort to speed things up, Ive focused on the other important debugging number, the tests counter 239. If I simply tried every possible combination of starting and destination platforms, I would need to run 17  16  272 tests. By figuring out various ways to predict whether a jump is impossible I have managed to lower the number of expensive tests run by a whopping 33 12. However the more exceptions and special cases I add to the code the more convinced I am that the actual problem is in the jump simulation code, which brings me at long last to my questionp  pHow would you determine, with complete reliability, whether it is possible for a character to jump from one platform to another, preferably without needing to simulate the whole jumpp  pMy specific platform physicsp  pJumps are fixed height, unless you hit a ceiling.p  pHorizontal movement has no acceleration or inertia.p  pHorizontal air control is allowed.p  pFurther info I found a hrefhttpsvimeo.com77361668 relnofollowthis videoa, which describes a similar problem but which doesnt provide a good solution. This is literally the only resource Ive found.p

Negative 859 pI have a website for which I have implemented Google Analytics Universal via Google Tag Manager. The website changes screens without a page reload, where the part of the URL changes after a hash for a different screen.

The only problem is that, after 5 linkclicks without a page refresh, the Universal Page Tag is not sent to Analytics anymore. I can see that the tag is fired in my GTM screen, but the pageview does not show up in Google Analytics or the dataSlayer extension. Does someone know why this happensp  pI also saw after a few extra linkclinks that an error hit is sent to Google. I looked for this hit type but cant find any documentation on it. p

Negative 859 pI am very much hoping you can help me with this as Ive spent all too much time on this.  First, my JSON formatting is unfortunately not very mutable and I have moved it to a number of different formats to support both some jquery and a phpbased search.  Each time I move it, the search will work and the rest of the site will break or viceversa.p  pIs it possible to access a JSON array by both name and index number  Here is my JSON stored in PHP file and being retrieved amp converted successfully to valid JSONp  precodeltphp  contents  array Song Name 1 by Artist Name 1 maininfo gt array     contentid gt 1,     aname gt Artist Name,     sname gt Song Name,     main gt core content 1,     maininfo gt url , Song Name 2 by Artist Name 2 maininfo gt array     contentid gt 2,     aname gt Artist Name,     sname gt Song Name,     main gt core content 2,     maininfo gt url   gt codepre  pMy search works when something in the array title is matched on, otherwise it returns no matches so I must leave the array title asis.p  pAnother part of my project uses jquery and has the followingp  precodeparsejsonobj[0][1][sname] successfully already returning Song Name codepre  pThe above will ONLY work when the array title is not provided e.g. strongSong Name 1 by Artist Name 1 maininfo  arraystrong becomes simply strongarraystrong.p  pFor those curious, file is being converted to JSON usingp  precodevar jsonobj      .ajax         url getjson.php,         dataType json,         success function doc           jsonobj  doc              codepre  pOn the PHP side, when getjson.php is called the JSON array above is loaded in and converted to valid JSON usingp  precodefinal  arrayfinalcontents headerContenttype applicationjson echo jsonencodefinal codepre  pNote finalcontents is just contents with an additional header added.  See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29200622searchingjsonarrayforvaluesandaccessingsurroundingkeysvaluesoutputasSearching JSON array for values and accessing surrounding keysvalues output as JSONa for the PHP I have running specifically.p  pThank you in advance. p

Negative 859 pDDD exposes bounded contexts, domain models, aggregates... but I often miss the keypoint of business rules. I would like to know how business rules integrate into this approach. Here is an example p  pImagine you have 2 bounded contexts in a credit company. One for debt recovery, the other for early refunds. These contexts embed real business specificities. In a conceptual point of view, I think these bounded contexts should separately embed common model parts, and similar domain model entities graph of 3 or 4 accountancy entities. Even if their respective models embed a common submodel we do not plan it can change, business rules that apply to these submodels are different. A DebtRecoveryService ensures rules are correctly applied, and another EarlyFundsService does the same, with specific accountancy rules. p  ul liShould this submodel be embedded and served to others by another dedicated bounded context if different business rules apply to them in terms of maths and respective behaviours .li liWhat defines an aggregate, is it only a part of a model li liDo specific business rules define specific aggregates  li ul  pemDo you think an aggregate should be considered only for the entity graph it represents, and be reused by other bounded contexts. Is it a good case for CQRS emp  pThanks,p

Im prepared to write the code where their written response fills in a section and I write the rest.p  pHow do I write code into the program with user input in it Example, I dont know if it worksp  precodeif String.equalsIgnoreCasehello      JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull,Hi  else      JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull,Sorry your message wasnt recognized. Create a reply for this message for the future.     Then Somehow let the user create their own reply into the code       codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated and Im sorry if this is confusing.p

Negative 859 pI am working on an object tracking pantilt system using a raspberry pi2 with opencv and a picamera. I am an ultra noob with python, so I am having a bit of trouble. I found a hrefhttpmitchtech.netraspberrypiservofacetracker relnofollowthisa, and got it to work, this tutorial uses the facedetect.py provided by opencv and added code from ServoBlaster to track and follow faces, center them on the screen using 2 servos. I want to do the same thing, only using the camshaft.py code instead of the facedetect.py code. As a web developer coldFusion this seems like it should be easy, but I cannot figure it out. So, I guess my question is how do I integrate servoblaster to pantilt based on the location of a selected object using python. Thanks in advance.p

There are as many as 1400 rows with the most common last name in my clients database.

This method refreshes the autocomplete acceptable, and works great for some of the result sets that are as big 500 rows. However, I run into trouble with larger result sets  ASP.NET returns an codeInternal Server Errorcode to the AJAX request with no apparent JSON payload.  I have tried modifying the Web.config to overcome default limitations on processing JSON, but it doesnt seem to make a difference maybe it enables me to get as many as 500 rows, I will have to check....p  precodeltadd keyaspnetMaxJsonDeserializerMembers value500000 gt ltadd keyaspnetUpdatePanelMaxScriptLength value2147483644 gt codepre  pI am also returning the only the bareminimum columns per person to populate the search results, but there is a lot of data per person.

Assuming this is not a herculean task.p

Negative 859 pIn Spring Data  Cassandra SDC, I want to reuse the same DataStax driver Session, but access different Keyspaces depending on which tenant in a multitenant SaaS model is accessing Cassandra at the moment.  That said, it appears in my research that adding the keyspace to make fullyqualified queries is preferred way to accomplish this.p  pDoes SDC have hooks to do this  Im looking for something similar to Hibernates multitenancy support.  In Hibernate, it can reuse the same Connection pool.  The app provides a way to tell Hibernate which tenant is in the current context and can control how Hibernates Session connects  possibly a different schema per tenant by calling SET SCHEMA footenantschema  on the JDBC connection or something.p  pIf not, I need to write it myself.  Thats fine.  Im thinking Id load a Map of tenantIDtokeyspace and somehow dynamically append it to make a fullyqualified call.  Im not sure how this would affect PreparedStatements of the DataStax Session, etc.  p  pIf there are any thoughts on a better way, please do tell.p

Negative 859 pIm building a SPA based on AngularJS. In one component of the SPA I have a document upload system, which is built via a custom directive below called docmgmt.

Upon the finding the right company the user clicks on the company name which is then passed back to the parent directive docmgmt called modalOutput. p  pThe issue I have is that despite using two way binding  a new scope for modalOutput output is created in modalCompanyQuery.

Negative 859 pI just started developing nodejs. Im confused to use async model. I believe there is a way to turn most of SYNC use cases into ASYNC way. Example, by SYNC, we load some data and wait until it returns then show them to user by ASYNC, we load data and return, just tell the user data will be presented later. I can understand why ASYNC is used in this scenario.p  pBut here I have a use case. Im building an web app, allowing user to place a order buying something. Before saving the order data into db, I want to put some user data together with order data Im using document NoSql db by the way. So I think by SYNC, after I get order data, I make a SYNC call to database and wait for its returned user data. After I get returned data, integrate them together and ingest into db.p  pI think there might be an issue if I make ASYNC call to db to query user data because user data may be returned after I save data to db. And thats not what I want.p  pSo in this case, how can I do this thing ASYNCHRONOUSLYp

Negative 859 pIn putting together a small webapp, Im trying to ensure that end users are unable to place invalid characters in a number field that can hold signed floats.  Im using Dojo to search on an applied CSS class in this case, codeogInputNumbercode and set events on input, keyup, and blur.p  pIdeally, I would like the input to be codetypenumbercode and to only allow digits, a hyphen for signed floats, and a period character to act as a decimal place.  If a user includes more than one hyphen or period character, the JS should truncate that second invalid character and everything thereafter in the input.  Unfortunately, the JS behaves differently depending on whether the input is codetypenumbercode or codetypetextcode.p  pFor codetypetextcode, if I attempt to enter the text code2.6acode, code2.6code is fine, but the codeacode is caught on the input event and prevented from appearing in the input.  This is the desired behavior, but I would like to have the input as codetypenumbercode so the number spinners appear and for ease of use with mobile devices so the number keyboard is brought up by default.p  pFor codetypenumbercode, if I attempt to enter the text code2.6acode, the code2.6code is allowed to remain, but as soon as codeacode is typed, the entire field is cleared out.  That will prevent any invalid characters, but its annoyingly overzealous.  Ive replicated this behavior on Chrome, Firefox, IE11, and Opera.p  pCan anyone offer any suggestions as to why the JS operates differently between inputs with codetypetextcode and those with codetypenumbercodep  pHTMLp  precodeltpgt     ltlabel fornumberInput1gtText Inputltlabelgt     ltinput idnumberInput1 classogInputNumber typetext gt ltpgt ltpgt     ltlabel fornumberInput2gtNumber Inputltlabelgt     ltinput idnumberInput2 classogInputNumber typenumber gt ltpgt codepre  pJSp  precode Checks number input fields for proper formatting require[dojodomReady, dojoon, dojoquery],  function ready, on, query      query.ogInputNumber.forEachfunction node           Replace all the nonnumeric, nonperiod, and nonhyphen characters with nothing while the user is typing         onnode, input, keyup, function               this.value  this.value.replace[d.]g,                    When the user leaves the input, format it properly as a signed float or zero if its something weird         onnode, blur, function               try                  if this.value                      this.value  parseFloatthis.value.toString                  else               catch error                  this.value  0                             codepre  pWorking JSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netetehy6o61 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netetehy6o61ap

For example, this is a row of a spreadsheetp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdwso3.png altenter image description herep  pAnd this what Excels saveas producesp  precode22041959,Bar,F,0132.00,0123.00,0059.00,0047.23 codepre  pThe date has no special formatting, and the time is formatted as code[mm].ss.00code. However, this is codein2csvcodes version of the csvp  precode19590422,Bar,F,0.00106481481481,0.000960648148148,0.00068287037037,0.000546643518519 codepre  pwhich is of course of no use at all. Any ideas There dont seem to be any commandline options for this  codenoinferencecode doesnt help. Thanks.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pBoth codecsvkitcode ans codexlrdcode do seem to take into account formatting, but theyre not smart about it. A date of 21021066 is passed though as the text string 21021066 in both cases, but a date 22041959 is turned into 21662.0 by codexlrdcode, and code19590422code by codecsvkitcode. Both of them just give up on small elapsed times and pass through the float representation. This is Ok if you know that the cell should contain an elapsed time, because you can just multiply by code246060code to get the right answer.p  pI dont think codexlrdcode would be much help here since its date tuple functions only handle seconds, and not centiseconds.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pFound out something interesting. I started with a base spreadsheet containing times. In one of them I formatted the times as code[m]ss.00code, and in the other I formatted them as code[mm]ss.00code. I then saved each as a code.xlscode and a code.xlsxcode, giving a total of 4 spreadsheets. Excel could convert all 4 to csv, and all the time text in the csvs appeared as originally written ie. code021.0code, for example, for 0m 21.0s.p  pcodein2csvcode cant handle the two code.xlscode versions at all this time appears as code000021code. It also cant handle the code[m]ss.00code version of the code.xlsxcode  conversion gives the catchall index out of range error. The only one of the 4 spreadsheets that codein2csvcode can handle is the code.xlsxcode one, with code[mm]ss.00code formatting.p
Negative 859 pI have tried all sorts of things to get this to work. Being that I am not an experienced JS coder, I am pretty sure this is something simple to fix. I am just not able to connect the dots. All I want to do is to let this ad code load on screen sizes larger than 540px, but anything smaller I want to essentially stop the code from executing. If I simply remove the variables on the ELSE section it still executes the ad code. How can I restructure this code to make it load above 540px and for it to be ignored on smaller screen sizes.

Negative 859 pI am trying to use AdMob Interstitial Ads in my application in Windows Phone 8. The version of GoogleAds.dll I am using is 6.5.13.0. Everything is working fine as per the samples provided by AdMob. I just had one query regarding the DismissingOverLay callback provided by the Interstitial Ad. It says that it is provided After the interstitialoverlay is dismissed. But in my case I am getting it in the following scenarios  1. When I dismiss the Ad by clicking the close image or hardware back key.This is fine. 2. When the Ad is clicked and external browser is open and when the external browser is closed. once when control leaves the app and once when it comes back. 3. When the hardware lock button is pressed. in this case I get the dismissed callback but when I unlock the screen, I can still find the ad, not being dismissed.p  pWhy I just need a clarification on this because I am trying to run some custom code when the Ad is actually dismissed, but as I am getting these callbacks at various points I am unable to find out when to accept these callbacks and when to rejectp

Negative 859 pI am building an API class that extends the functionality of a vendor class.

It is not seen as a method, but rather a property which contains a closure. Not only does codemethodexistcode fail, but attempting to call the method fails.p  pHeres a modified version where Im trying to figure out whats going wrong.p  precodepublic function extendBlockblockName, Closure closure      methodName  camelcaseblockblockName     newClosure  clone closure     newClosure  newClosuregtbindTothis      thisgtmethodName  newClosure     thisgtmethodName      return methodexiststhis, methodName  codepre  pNone of this works.

I was wondering how well does spark work for say records  lt 10000   I have huge number of files around  each file having around 10000 records , say 100 column file coming into my hadoop data platform and i need to perform some data quality checks before i load then into hbase. p  pI do the data quality check in hive which uses MapReduce at the backend. For each file it takes about 8 mins and thats pretty bad for me. Will spark give me a better performance lets say 23 mins  p  pI know I got to do a bench marking but i was trying to understand the basics here before i really get going with spark.  As I recollect creating RDDs for the first time will be an overhead and since i got to create a new RDD for each incoming file that going to cost me a bit.p  pI am confused which would be the best approach for me   spark , drill, storm or Mapreduce itself  p

Negative 859 pAs stated in apples documents. I always thought that specifying a property as atomic meant that it was thread safe, where only a single thread can setaccess the property at a time. Whats the point of have atomic if its not thread safe and is alot slower. And if it is said to be not thread safe, what makes it considerably slower if you can still access it simultaneously p
Negative 859 pSo I have a horizontal RecyclerView inside a vertical ScrollView. Everything inside my layout is displayed fine and it all scrolls in the directions I want and it does it smoothly. p  pThe only problem I have, is that the RecyclerView is below some other content in the ScrollView and when the RecyclerView is partially visible, it will line the bottom of the RecyclerView with the bottom of the screen on startup. This means that the content above the RecyclerView is pushed off the screen.p  pDoes anyone know why this happens, and how I can fix itp  pHere is a simple layout that does what I just described. You dont even need to populate the RecyclerView, it will still do it.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltScrollView     xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt      ltLinearLayout         androidorientationvertical         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt          ltLinearLayout             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheight500dp             androidbackgroundfffgt          ltandroid.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheight200dp             androidbackground000gt      ltLinearLayoutgt  ltScrollViewgt codepre

Negative 859 pWell, i have 3 swipe tabs and in each tab i have called a asynctask in the fragments onCreateView method. Its showing result in normal case but the problem is when i rotate the screen. Basically it closes forcefully when a asynctask is going on and before completing the taski rotate the screen. p  pSo, i have tried to cancel the asynctask in onPause and call it again in onCreateView. Below is the code inside a fragmentp  precodepublic class AllFragment extends Fragment     SearchBusBeans searchBusObj   ArrayListltSearchBusBeansgt searchBusObjarr  SearchingBusesAdapter myAdapter  Override public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,         Bundle savedInstanceState   .....   ....  searchBusObjarr  new ArrayListltSearchBusBeansgt   new GetSearchedBusesAsync.execute   Override public void onPause      super.onPause      GetSearchedBusesAsync asyncObj  new GetSearchedBusesAsync     ifasyncObj.getStatus  AsyncTask.Status.RUNNING         asyncObj.canceltrue          private class GetSearchedBusesAsync extends AsyncTaskltVoid, Void, Voidgt         Override     protected void onPreExecute  super.onPreExecute       Override     protected Void doInBackgroundVoid... params               ifisCancelled             this.canceltrue          ifisCancelled         ...........            ......do my codes.......            searchBusObj  new SearchBusBeans            searchBusObj.setnamejname            searchBusObjarr.addsearchBusObj                   return null            Override     protected void onPostExecuteVoid result               super.onPostExecuteresult         pBar.setVisibilityView.GONE          myAdapter  new SearchingBusesAdaptergetActivity.getApplicationContext, searchBusObjarr         gridView.setAdaptermyAdapter         end of asynctask   end of fragment codepre  pNow as you can see that i have cancelled the asynctask in onPause. and inside doInBackground i have done my code in conditionifisCancelled.
