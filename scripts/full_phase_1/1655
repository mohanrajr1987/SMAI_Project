Positive 1655 pWhats the easiest way to layout items like this So basically 2 item types  one half a width of a screen minus padding and one full width. Id like to use one layout rather than using gridview for every segment.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comcrlHQ.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcrlHQ.png altlayout to getap  pOf course I could inflate the view consisting of 2 items and then switch by the type of the element  while the layout stays the same basically a simple listview should do. But this seems unnatural. There is also something like emStaggeredGridLayoutManagerem but this smells also for this simple use case.p

At the same time, we dont want to have any limitations that might hinder our progress later on, or otherwise make the game not fun in certain ways.p  pFor example, i learnt that certain animations arent possible in 2D such as rotation etc. I would like the ability to have the players character be able to morph into animals and there must be the ability to shoot at the monsters, like shooting an arrow and seeing it fly through and hit the other person. Are these things possible in 2Dp  pIn the future, if we wanted to go from 3D to 2D, would it be possible without fully rewriting the gamep

Negative 1655 pIm wondering if there is a defined standard for what the default action is of various HTML elements.  Ive looked at the a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTR1999REChtml40119991224cover.html relnofollowW3Cs HTML specificationa and while they are very precise with what attributes can be used with elements and also some behavioural stuff such as exactly what gets included with form submission theres nothing about the behaviour of elements.  Ive also checked out the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgEnDOM relnofollowMozilla JS referencea, and found nothing there either.p  pIn particular Im looking for the default behaviour of a form submit button Ive seen in different places that its default action is to submit the form and alternatively that its default action is not to submit the form but rather to get focus.  Accordingly, there seems to be no consensus on whether codeonclickreturn falsecode for a submit button will stop form submission or not.p  pEdit for clarity  Im not trying to do any formlevel validation on the submits codeonclickcode or anything like that if I were, Id be using the forms codeonsubmitcode instead.  I really am specifically interested in catching clicks on the button and potentially not having it submit the form in this case.  This might end up requiring the buttons codeonclickcode set some state that the forms codeonsubmitcode inspects, but if I can just codereturn falsecode then thats great.  Even if not, it would then be critical what order the codeonsubmitcode and codeonclickcode handlers get fired i.e. does the button dispatch the submit before running its click handler which again I havent seen specified anywhere.p  pWhile it would be simply to code up a test, Id rather rely on specsdocumented behaviour rather than the results of a trivial test that would undoubtedly miss any subtleties should they exist.  In particular, I ran a quick test last week that seemed to show it emdidntem stop form submission, but running one today shows that it emdoesem. I have had no luck finding any sort of authoritative resource as to what browsers emactually doem when you interact with their elements e.g. what the default action is, whether the onclick handler for a submit button fires before or after the form submission dispatch, etc.p  pAny advice as to where to look in this case would be welcome.p

Negative 1655 pI have an interesting at least to me problem  I cant manage to find a way to reliably and portably get information on grandchildren processes in certain cases.  I have an application, a hrefhttpalltray.trausch.us relnofollowAllTraya, that I am trying to get to work in certain strange cases where its subprocess spawns a child and then dies.  AllTrays job is essentially to dock an application to the task tray, which is usually specified as a command line for AllTray to invoke i.e., codealltray xtermcode would start xterm, and manage it in AllTray.p  pMost GUI software runs just fine under it.  It sets the codeNETWMPIDcode property on its window or a widget library does and alls well, because codeNETWMPIDcode  codeforkcodeed child.  However, in some cases such as when running codeoowritercode, or software written to run under KDE such as K3b, the child process that AllTray runs is a wrapper, be it a shell script as in OO.os case or a strange program that codeforkcodes and codeexeccodes itself and effectively backgrounds itself, since the parent process dies very early.p  pI had the idea to not reap my child processes, so as to preserve in the process table the parent process ID for my grandchildren, so that I could link them back to me by traversing the family tree from bottomtotop.  That doesnt work, though  once my child process dies and turns into a zombie, the system considers my grandchild process to be an orphan, and codeinitcode adopts it.  This appears to be the case on at least Linux 2.6 and NetBSD Id presume its probably the norm, and POSIX doesnt seem to specify that to be the case, so I was hoping for the opposite.p  pSince that approach wont work, I thought about using codeLDPRELOADcode and intercepting my child process call to codeforkcode, and passing information back to my parent process.  However, Im concerned that wont be as portable as the ideal solution, because different systems have different rules on how the dynamic linker does things like codeLDPRELOADcode.  It wont work for setuidsetgid GUI applications either without the helper library also being setuid or setgid, at least on Linux systems.  Generally, it smells like a bad idea to me, and feels quite hackish.p  pSo, Im hoping that someone has an idea on how to do this, or if the idea of relying on a mechanism like codeLDPRELOADcode is really the only option I have short of patching kernels which is emnotem going to happen.p

However, I need to make it so the user can choose a color of a t shirt.

Negative 1655 pSo, both codeListBox.ObjectCollectioncode and codeListView.ListViewItemCollectioncode implement the codeIListcode class, which provides codeAddcode and codeRemovecode methods but no codeAddRangecode, codeInsertRangecode, or codeRemoveRangecode. However, codeListBox.ObjectCollectioncode and codeListView.ListViewItemCollectioncode also provide an codeAddRangecode method  just no codeInsertRangecode or codeRemoveRangecode.p  pLook at the codeArrayListcode class, on the other hand, which on top of implementing codeIListcode also provides codeAddRangecode, codeInsertRangecode, and codeRemoveRangecode. The same difference exists between the generic forms of this class and interface, codeListltTgtcode which has codeAddRangecode, codeInsertRangecode, and codeRemoveRangecode and codeIListltTgtcode which only provides codeAddcode and codeRemovecode.p  pI can understand the codeIListcode and codeIListltTgtcode interfaces not providing codeAddRangecode, etc.  its just an interface anything beyond the minimum requirements of codeAddcode, codeRemovecode, codeRemoveAtcode, etc. is optional.

The main model is Case, which codehasmanycode Subjects, Keywords, Notes, and Evidences which, in turn, codehasmanycode CustodyLogs.  Since the application is legalrelated, there are some requirements that are out of the ordinaryp  ul liCRUD operations must be logged, including what the operation was, who the actor was, and when the operation occurredli liThere needs to be some way to validate the data i.e. recording MD5 checksums of recordsli liSome data should be writeonce i.e. the app can create an audit log entry, but that log cannot be edited or deleted from within the application thereafterli liChanges to associated objects probably should be logged throughout the nesting.  For example, adding a CustodyLog to a piece of Evidence should have a log for itself, a log for its Evidence, and a log for the parent Case.  This is to ensure that the last update timestamp for the Case accurately reflects the real last update, and not just the last time that the Case model data itself changed. ul  pIve got bits of this working, but Im running into a problem.  Authentication is being handled by an external web singlesignon service, so the only visibility to the ID of the logged in user is in a request variable.  If I put audit logging in the model, through a callback, for example, I can be fairly sure that all data modifications are logged, but the model has no visibility to the request variables, so I cant log the user ID.  This also ensures that changes to the state machine currently using statemachine plugin get logged.p  pIf, on the other hand, I put the audit logging in the application controller, I lose the ability to be sure that all CRUD operations are logged code in the Case model calling Subject.create, for example, wouldnt be logged.  I also think that Id lose state changes.p  pIs there a way to be sure that all CRUD operations are logged throughout the association tree such that the user ID of the logged in user is recordedp

Negative 1655 pI work with a small team that uses git for source code management.  Recently, we have been doing topic branches to keep track of features then merging them into master locally then pushing them to a central git repository on a remote server.  This works great when no changes have been made in master  I create my topic branch, commit it, merge it into master, then push.  Hooray.p  pHowever, if someone has pushed to origin before I do, my commits are not fastforward.  Thus a merge commit ensues.  This also happens when a topic branch needs to merge with master locally to ensure my changes work with the code as of now.  So, we end up with merge commits everywhere and a git log rivaling a friendship bracelet.  p  pSo, rebasing is the obvious choice.  What I would like is to p  ul licreate topic branches holding several commitsli licheckout master and pull fastforward because i havent committed to masterli lirebase topic branches onto the new head of masterli lirebase topics against masterso the topics start at masters head, bringing master up to my topic headli ul  pMy way of doing this currently is listed belowp  precodegit checkout master git rebase master topic1 git rebase topic1 topic2 git checkout master git rebase topic2 git branch d topic1 topic2 codepre  pIs there a faster way to do thisp

If he used his card in any company which is not in the group the total should not include transaction from this ungrouped company. I have C code to feed the database as transactions happens. My femtransactions table has companyid, amountrewarduser, femuserloginid, fromgroup this decides if the user has transacted out of the group or from the group, authorized etc..p  pI want to filter the amount spent by the user 193 in each group separately. p  pI understood the JOINTS concepts now but i need to know why t.fromgroup on the second query is ignored p

Negative 1655 pIm a bit of a newb when it comes to threading, so any pointers in the right direction would be a great help. Ive got a game with both a fairly heavy update function, and a fairly heavy draw function. Id assume that the majority of the weight in the draw function is going to happen on the GPU. Because of this, Id like to start calculating the update on the next frame while the drawing is happening. Right now, my game loop is quite simplep  precodeGamegtUpdate1 GamegtUpdate2 GamegtDraw codepre  pcodeUpdate1code updates variables that do not change game state, so it can run independently from Draw. That is to say, there should be no fights over data between the two. It is also the bulk of the CPU processing.p  pcodeUpdate2code updates variables that Draw needs, and it is quite fast, so it seems right to have it running serially with codeDrawcode. Additionally, I believe that the codeDrawcode function is light on CPU and heavy on GPU.p  pWhat I would like to happen is that while the GPU is busy processing all the Draw functionality, the next frames Update1 can use the CPU to get the next frames update ready. It doesnt seem like Im automatically getting this functionality  the Draw cycle seems to take a little while and block everything until its done, which is less than ideal. p  pWhats the proper way to do this Is this already happening, and Im just not observing it properlyp

This is all fine and dandy, so far I have been defining the properties of the form in a hardcoded way, basically matching a property to a certain form a ChoiceField, a Boolean, etc. BUT, what I would like instead of hardcoding these values is essentially create a properties dictionary dynamically, based on what information I pass it...p  pI basically have an array of options, and so here are the two methods I am consideringp  ol liHave a function for my options modelobject that will have a series of ifelses.

Negative 1655 pIn my mind, codeListcode is basically implemented using codeLinkedListcode, while a normal codeArraycode is implemented as contiguous blocks. I always used codeListcode because it is in the codeGenericcode namespace and because I thought it used emdynamic memory allocationem  but I was wrong.p  pYesterday I saw the implementation of codeListcode using Reflector and found it is actually an array of TcodeT[]code. There are lots of codeArray.Copycode around while manipulating each element in the codeListcode. For instance, when you use codeInsertcode, it will create a new memory and copy all the elements beforeafter the inserted elements. So it seem to me the use of codeListcode is very expensive.p  pI saw the codeSortedListcode as well. I am not sure why a codeSortedListcode also implements an array inside it. Dont you think codeSortedListcode would be horrible to use an array as you need to sort the list every time a minor manipulation to the codeListcode occursp  pI also wonder why codeListcode is so popular as most people use it rather than going for codeLinkedListcode. Is it only because of the flexibility of the indexerp

Negative 1655 pIm working on a web application that automates a reservation process using the Google Calendar API and PHP. When the user first selects a date, my script creates a tentative event on the Calendar to prevent other users from trying to select the same date. However, to avoid the proliferation of tentative dates created by users that dont follow through, I want to impose a time limit on the transaction process, so that if the user leaves the app or takes too long, the tentative date will be removed from the calendar and thus available for other users to reserve.p  pWere currently storing the appointments in a MySQL db as well as the Google Cal, so heres my current strategy when the tentative appointment is first created, store the tentative appointment in the db with a timestamp. Then, schedule a cron job maybe every hour or so that scans through the database and removes tentative reservations based on the age of their timestamp removing them from both the db and the google cal.p  pIn theory, this should work.

So that would cover my static pages.p  pQuestion 1 would indexing be preserved in other words, domain.comfoo would show domain.comfooindex.phpp  pQuestion 2 is there a way to use a single template file with these static pages so the static file is really only the content At the moment, my rewrite rules point all URLs to a main template file that looks for the requested file and then includes it.p  pMoving on, the rewrite rules would redirect you to index.php for any URLs that didnt match the above rule. I assume thats where Id want my code to determine if its an actual URL for my site, and deliver the content accordingly.p  pQuestion 3 redirecting to index.php isnt going to pass along any variables to process. If I used index.phpurl1 would that account for both domain.comhi and domain.comhitherep  pQuestion 4 what steps can I take to ensure the URLs processed are legitimate and not xss attacks or anything like that Should I set up a separate table in my MySQL database that stores all the possible URLs along with the ID of the content I assume thats how Wordpress works. Or, if not using MySQL, would I do this with a class, or arrayp  pI know its a lot, thanks in advance for everyones helpp

Negative 1655 pIm looking for a simple easytouse client side upload validator.

Other solutions recommend use of activeX which seems to have inconsistent results on different browsers.p  pFlash is a obvious favourite, but the flash solutions such as a hrefhttpwww.uploadify.com relnofollowUPLOADIFYa and a hrefhttpwww.swfupload.org relnofollowSWFUploadera seem to bundled with ajax uploaders and progress bars. This is likely to disrupt my existing form and server side processing scripts, so Im just looking for a simple mechanism to validate the file either on blur or change on the file input, or on submission of the form.

Negative 1655 pI have a partial view that I want to be generic. According to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions875085genericpartialviewhowtosetagenericclassasmodelthis questiona, partial views cannot be generic. So I instead made an HtmlHelper extension that handles the pieces for which I want typesafety, then hands off the rest to a real partial view.p  pUsually my helper is called on page load, which works fine, but sometimes I want to add a row or something through AJAX. When this happens, the controller cannot use my partial view since it does not have access to the HtmlHelper.p  pApart from having a partial view with a model of type codeobjectcode, is there anything I can do p  pIm using Razor, if that is important.p  pA simplified version of what Im doingp  precodepublic static MvcHtmlString DoStuffltTgtthis HtmlHelper html, IEnumerableltTgt data,    FuncltT, ViewModelTypegt StronglyTypedFn, string PartialName       the pre and postprocessing for the partial view is complex enough Id like    to encapsulate it.

Negative 1655 pTrying to determine memory usage in a vanilla web app run through tomcat.p  pI assume that a virtual hosts setup will use significantly less memory than hostperinstance. What is the minimum memory footprint of a single host tomcat 7 instance For each instance added does the memory footprint grow linearly, or can we share common resources among instancesp  pI would prefer a multiinstance setup, so as to isolate client sites i.e. not affect other sites on redeploy or restart, but memory usage is the key.  If each instance requires 512mb ram like grails, for example, then I may have to take the virtual host route as I was not intending to use the 16GB ram available on tomcat alonep  pSuggestions appreciated. BTW, only a handful of sites will incur significant load the majority are small and draw on a client CMS perhaps I can virtual hosts these sites and only hostperinstance with the important client sitesp

Im guessing that it was not designed to handle the two levels of codeimageablecode objects above the codepicturecode object.  Another issue is that in one instance the codepicturescode controller has to handle a one level resourcenesting situation and in another it has to handle a two levels situation.

Negative 1655 pI am building an application program in C which uses Windows hooks to control thirdparty programs. The program I am making is a tutorial program to show how to use these thirdparty programs. I can find the process ID of the thirdparty program that I want to hook into and I can then query this process ID to find a list of thread IDs to use as a parameter for the Windows API function SetWindowsHookEx. However I am concerned that from the list of thread IDs from the running process I will hook into a thread that could potentially finish at any moment. Ideally I would like to hook into the thread running the main gui which is more than likely going to be one of the longest living threads and even if it isnt the longest living thread the tutorial program is designed to work with the GUI so it is still ideal. If the thirdparty application has more than one gui then I would like to find the thread ID for the main GUI.p  pSo my question is from the list of thread IDs I get from querying the process id is there a way to find either the main GUI id or another suitable thread which will be active until the program has quit Obviously the thread ID that I choose needs to have an event queue so I can hook into it.p

The 255 field limit for access and the 30ish columns of biographical data also stored in this database means that i need to split the DB. p  pSo, I have managed to get all the bioinfo quite happily into a new table with p  precodeSELECT id,[all bio column names] INTO resultsBioData FROM results codepre  pthis didnt cause to much of a problem as i am not casting anything, but for the question data i want to convert it all to integers, at the moment I havep  precodeSELECT id,CIntq1 AS nq1.......CIntq220 AS nq220 INTO resultsItemData FROM results codepre  pThis seems to work fine for about 400 records but then just stops, I thought it may be because it hit something it cant convert to a integer to start with, so i wrote a little java program that deleted any record where any of ther 220 answers wasnt 0,1,2,3,4 or 5 and it still gives up around 400 never the same record thoughp  pAnyone got any ideas I am doing this on my test system at the moment and would really like something robust before i do it to our live systemp  pSorry for the long winded question, but its doing my head inp

Negative 1655 pThis may or may not be a SWIG question.p  pI am trying to return a stdwstring by value from a C function to C.  The returned string has a mixture of plain old English chars and Hebrew chars.  The English chars come through fine, but the Hebrew chars are being converted to the question mark symbol at some point.p  pI am using SWIG to generate the marshalling code.  Stepping through it all with a debugger, it gets to the following SWIG code...p  precodestatic string CreateWString[MarshalAsUnmanagedType.LPWStr]IntPtr cString      string str  System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.PtrToStringUnicString     return str  codepre  pAt this point str looks perfect.p  pNext this is returned to the SWIGgenerated C code which returns the str as a void.p  pThen the void becomes a .net string again in the calling code.  In the calling code, all the hebrew chars are  marks.p  pAny ideas whats causing thisp  pstrongEditstrong p  pFurther informationp  pAs soon as CreateWString returns to the C caller you can see the pointer in the debugger looks to be an ANSI string with  marks in it.  So it seems that .net is performing some sort of conversion on the string before it returns to the caller.  Does that sound right  How can I control thatp  pstrongEdit 2strong It seems I need to do MarshallAs on the return type CreateWString to stop .net from converting to a TCHAR type p

Given codenetworkcfisAdEnAT.txtcode which properly resolves, I want codenetworkcfisAdenat.txtcode.p  pI know one way to do it is to recursively iterate over the path, match them in all lower case, and get the actual case returned by the directory iteration.

Negative 1655 pIm wanting to implement web services in my C or CCLI application so that it may communicate with another application written in Pascal.p  pIve been looking around but cant seem to find any definitive answers regarding this. It would appear that WCF is the implementation of this, but Im not sure if this is the correct path because I dont want to read up on it in detail before knowing it is the right path and whether it enables crosslanguage communication. Also WCF seems to require the use of IIS which seems unnecessary  presumably web services are implemented as a protocal layer on top of TCPIP.p  pWhat Im really asking is is WCF the correct thing for accomplishing crosslanguage, crossnetwork communication If it isnt, what is If it is, can someone point me in the right direction to learn more about it I know there are a lot of resources, I just dont really know where to startp  pThanks very much in advancep  pEDIT Ok, so the web service is already created on a server. All I need to do is communicate with it. Im told there should be a class defined in the .NET framework which handles this connection  basically, I get a header or some file defining the method prototypes and a URL of the server and pass it to this object and it creates these methods locally. Is this correct How is this implemented Thanks againp

Negative 1655 pI am learning how to use Twisted AMP.  I am developing a program that sends data from a client to a server and inserts the data in a SQLite3 DB. The server then sends back a result to the client which indicates success or error try and except might not be the best way to do this but it is only a temporary solution while I work out the main problem. In order to do this I modified an example I found that originally did a sum and returned the result, so I realize that this might not be the most efficient way to do what I am trying to do. In particular I am trying to do some timings on multiple insertions i.e. send the data to the server multiple times for multiple insertions and I have included the code I have written. It works but clearly it is not a good way to send multiple data for insertion since I am performing multiple connections before running the reactor.p  pI have tried several ways to get around this including passing the ClientCreator to  reactor.callWhenRunning but you cannot do this with a deferred.p  pAny suggestions, advice or help with how to do this would be much appreciated.

Negative 1655 pI recently wrote a quick and dirty BFS implementation, to find diamonds in a directed graph.

Then I compared it with codey  toVisit[0] toVisit  toVisit[1]code, and to my surprise, the last implementation is actually the fastest one.p  pDoes this make any sense Is there any performance reason to ever use codelist.popcode instead of the apparently much faster twolinerp

Negative 1655 pI have a WCF service with one async method, updateUsers. The username is unique, so when I save changes, if exists a username that is assign to a new user, I get an UpdateException.p  pI Create a custom exception, UniqueKeyUsersException, that have three properties, a int64 with the ID and two strings, one for the username and other with the password. By the moment are all the fields that there are in the table of the database.p  pThis exception, are decorate as Serializable and implements the ISerializable interface. With this, I can send the information to the client. If I do not implement this interface, to the client arrives the exception, but all the properties are null.p  pAll works fine, to the client arrives the FaultException with the information of the username that exists.p  pHowever, I am thinking in the possibility to use only one property in the exception, of type Users, that is a self tracking entity that I have in an external library. The idea is to send to the client the entity with the register that exists in the database, so the user can decide to see the information of the existing user. In this way, the user save the needed to do a new query. If I would send the exception with my three properties, I would have to create a new object Users and convert the information from the exception to the Users entity.p  pMy problem is that when I add in the exception a property of type Users a STE when I throw the FaultException, it fails, crash the service. I think that it could be for serialization reasons, that perhaps its needed, in the implementation of the ISerialize, add the serialization of the STE.p  pBut it would be a lot of work, because the STE has not only the information of the database, but also the tracking of the entity and other properties.p  pSo my question is if exists any way to use a STE as property of the exception or I can only use basic typesp  pThanks.

Negative 1655 pI have a large set of data which Im trying to represent in 3D hoping to spot a pattern.

In the latter solution if I use two views I need to then create duplicate IBOutlets for every member in the viewp  pI wish I could simply do the followingp  ol liCreate a storyboard which contains a portrait and a landscape view.li liSet a single outlet for each property that each view can reference.li liRotate the view as needed.li ol  pI hope to solve this issue before I go down the wrong rabbit hole.p  pNOTE Storyboard does not allow movement of UIViews outside of the hierarchy for design purposes. I can do this in .xib files. This means if I have a portrait and landscape view in a .xib I can physical move them to separate areas to edit them. Storyboards do not allow this so I would have to create a separate view controller in landscape mode, edit it, then move the view into place. However, it would be a pain to make edits in the future.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 1655 pI need to handle timeouts on my .ajax calls for a jQueryMobile project. Doing some research Ive come across two viable methods of doing this.p  pstrikecode.errorcodestrike code.failcode seems to be generic if the call fails for any reason then im kicked back an error stack, and then the function call is written to handle whatever I need it to.p  pcode.timeoutcode, seems to let me deal specifically with timeouts and specify a time period that I can wait, if i dont receive an answer, then the call times out and throws an error.p  pMy question is in a mobile environment, would it be better to handle timeouts with the code.timeoutcode call Or should I blanket all calls with the strikecode.errorcodestrike code.failcode function and handle timeouts within the error callback p  pWorking with mobile devices it is expected that a user may walk out of a coverage zone, so if the call never returns, my gut would say to implement a timeout function. Do error callbacks have a built in timeout I would like to handle all errors gracefully, so it seems that maybe a happy medium would be implementing both, and specifying timeouts to work directly with the timeout callback.p  pIs there anything I might be missing herep

Negative 1655 pI am creating a game for iphone that has a few hundred levels. These are all loaded into a scroll view when the user presses the start button so that they can choose a level. However, I need to do a lot of calculations, load each levels data from a keyed encoder, and draw a codeUIImageViewcode on the scrollview before I can show the screen to the user. As it is right now, this is all done by methods I call from codeviewDidLoadcode, so it all happens BEFORE the view controller gets pushed onto the stack. As a result, there is a noticeable delay when the user pushes this button.p  pI would like to have the view controller be pushes immediately, and then have the levels lay themselves out AFTER the view controller is presented, hopefully providing a better user experience. I imagine this would be possible by calling the methods from codeViewDidAppearcode but I would rather start doing the calculations immediately in order to make things as fast as possible. p  pIs there a way to do this Possibly using grand central dispatch or assigning the work to another threadp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 1655 pIm writing a small program to request a chunk of a file, and then have another program return that specific chunk of the file. I can get this to work using files up to about 555000 bytes, but on anything lager than that, I get unusual behavior. p  pIn my loop, I check a progress buffer, which is an array of integers, to see whether or not I have a specific chunk of the file. If I do, then I dont send a request for that chunk, but if I dont, then I request the chunk from a peer. I have a linked list that I move over, where each peer in the list has a sockfd associated with that. So, in a sense, I round robin the requests out. Once I send them out, I wait for messages to come in. I dont know if this is the best approach, but it seemed to be the most natural.p  pHowever, for files that are larger, it hangs at the select call. Im not entirely sure why. If anyone can shed some light on this, or suggest a better approach, Id love to hear it.p  pHere is my code. I didnt include the code for the functions that I call, but I dont think its necessary in this instance they are modified versions of Beejs sendall and recvall functions.

Negative 1655 pI have a fairly tricky situation that Im trying to determine the best design for.  The basics are thisp  ul liIm designing a messaging system with a similar interface to email.li liWhen a user clicks a message that has an attachment, an activity is spawned that shows the text of that message along with a paper clip signaling that there is an additional attachment.li liAt this point, I begin preloading the attachment so that when the user clicks on it  it loads more quickly.li licurrently, when the user clicks the attachment, it prompts with a loading dialog until the download is complete at which point it loads a separate attachment viewer activity, passing in the bmp byte array.li liI dont ever want to save attachments to persistent storage.li ul  pThe difficulty I have is in supporting rotation as well as home button presses etc.  The download is currently done with a thread and handler setup.p  pInstead of this, Id like the flow to be the followingp  ul liUser loads message as before, preloading begins of attachment as before invisible to user.li liWhen the user clicks on the attachment link, the attachment viewer activity is spawned right away.li liIf the download was done, the image is displayed. If not, a dialog is shown in THIS activity until it is done and can be displayed.  Note that ideally the download never restarts or else Ive wasted cycles on the preload.li ul  pObviously I need some persistent background process that is able to keep downloading and is able to call back to arbitrarily bonded Activities.  It seems like the IntentService almost fits my needs as it does its work in a background thread and has the Service non UI lifecycle.  However, strongwill it work for my other needsstrongp  pI notice that common implementations for what I want to do get a Messenger from the caller Activity so that a Message object can be sent back to a Handler in the callers thread.  This is all well and good but what happens in my case when the caller Activity is Stopped or Destroyed and the currently active Activity the attachment viewer is showing  strongIs there some way to dynamically bind a new Activity to a running IntentService so that I can send a Message back to the new Activitystrongp  pThe other question is on the Message object.  Can I send arbitrarily large data back in this package  For instance, rather than send back that The file was downloaded, I need to send back the byte array of the downloaded file itself since I never want to write it to disk and yes this needs to be the case.p  pAny advice on achieving the behavior I want is greatly appreciated.  Ive not been working with Android for that long and I often get confused with how to best handle asynchronous processes over the course of the Activity lifecycle especially when it comes to orientation changes and home button presses...p

Negative 1655 pI currently have an Android application that has an intentfilter to receive images from the Gallery. It is important that the images are received in the same order that the user selected them in. This seems to be the default behavior on most devices, however on some devices so far Ive seen this on Motorolas running Android 4.x the order seems undefined. Does anyone know a way to declare in the intent that the images should be received in order Or a way once the images are recieved to determine the selected orderp  pHere is relevant code from the manifestp  precode ltactivity        androidlabelstringappname        androidname.activities.ImportImagesActivity gt         ltintentfiltergt               ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.SEND gt            ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.DEFAULT gt             ltdata androidmimeTypeimage gt        ltintentfiltergt        ltintentfiltergt               ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.SENDMULTIPLE gt            ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.DEFAULT gt             ltdata androidmimeTypeimage gt        ltintentfiltergt    ltactivitygt codepre  pAnd from ImportImagesActivityp  precodeprivate ListltUrigt parseIncomingData      ListltUrigt uriList  null      Intent intent  this.getIntent     ifintent  null          String action  intent.getAction         Single Image         if action.equalsIgnoreCaseandroid.intent.action.SEND              removed for brevity                               Multiple Images         else if action.equalsIgnoreCaseandroid.intent.action.SENDMULTIPLE              uriList   intent.getParcelableArrayListExtraIntent.EXTRASTREAM                    more code  at this point images have been recieved      return uriList  codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTo give a little context, let me explain the general flow of the app. The user opens the Gallery and selects images. They choose to Share them with my app. My application receives a list of Uris which are then displayed using an internal gallery  backed by a custom Adapter class. The images display correctly based on the Uri list, strongthe issue is the order of the ListltUrigt is sometimes incorrectstrong. It is important to my users that the images appear in the same order they select them in. p  pstrongClarificationstrong When I use the term Gallery I am referring to the built in Android app Gallery.  When I use the term Share I am referring to the the Share button within the Gallery app. This allows the user to select from a list of services such as Facebook, Email, and in this case my app. p  pFor Example imagine a Gallery with 3 images, displayed in an arbitrary order A, B, and C. The user selects first C then A then B and chooses to share them with my app. On most phones my list will be correctly ordered C, A, B, on offending phones this order seems random. p  pI cannot use the creation timestamp because the creation time is generally irrelevant to the selection order. Adding custom meta data doesnt help either because I dont know the correct initial order.  p
Negative 1655 pAll, Im working on an application that uses geolocation services provided by phonegap using latest version 2.2.0.

Ive implemented simple semaphore using counter and mutex  before step 2  counter is initialized with number of tasks to be loaded and when each task is complete counter decrements. If counter  zero then I send pthreadcondsignal from the worker thread, and pthreadcondwait at Step 4 catches it.p  pI feel like its not most efficient way to do this i dont like lockunlock in each thread for counter decrement, its a big overhead especially if task payload is small, but cant get idea on how to improve.

I cant join threads because they are to be reused in next cycle.p  pI would appreciate any inputideas. Thank you.p
Negative 1655 pI want to store comparisons between items in a mysql table.

Negative 1655 pI currently have a form using formtag. One of the fields is a dropdown list of options. Each option value matches the name of a method in my controller. What I want to do is when the form submit button is clicked, it runs the controller method corresponding directly to the value selected in the dropdown field.p  pIve built a workaround right now, but it feels too verbosep  precodedef runreports   case params[reportname]     when method1 then method1     when method2 then method2     when method3 then method3     when method4 then method4     else method1 end  each method matches a method already defined in the controller   i.e. method1  is an existing method codepre  pI had thought that it may work to use the dropdown option value to run the corresponding method in my controller through the formtag action i.e. action  params[reportname], but this doesnt work because the action in the form needs to be set before the params value is set. I dont want to use javascript for this functionality.p  pHere is my formp  precodelt formtag..reportsrunreports, method gt get do gt   lt selecttag reportname, optionsforselect[[  Please Select  ,nil],[Option 1,method1], [Option 2,method2], [Option 3,method3], [Option 4,method4]] gt   lt submittag Run Report gt lt end gt codepre  pAny suggestionsp  pCan I change my controller method to look something like this  but to actually call the controller method to run Im guessing this wont run because the params value is returned as a string...p  precodedef runreports   params[reportname] end codepre

Negative 1655 pi was try to beginning rubyjruby desktop application development, as ive googled before, ruby lacks of distributiondeployment system, so i havent decided which one to use, is it ruby with greenshoes gtk or JRuby with purpleshoes swing, if i go with greenshoes, then i should provide GTK Runtime, and if JRuby then i should provide JRE, or maybe if possible a portable internet browser and portable server just like PHPs UniServer.p  pis there any other alternative to overcome this, so that i could distribute my program, ruby with all required dependency for my program only by copying the folder in such portable wayp  pso if ithey want to use it on windows, i only need to create a shortcut to the my program on the copied folder,  and when ithey want to use it on linux, i only need to ln s to PATH to that my program on the copied folderp
Negative 1655 pHi I have an old Mobinnova Beam Elan w Windows CE 6 Embedded Code 6. I am wondering if I can, via a memory stick loaded with some variety of ARM Linux, boot up Linux on this machine, the specs for which will be forthcoming.  If so, could youd be so kind as to detail how to do so with sufficient specifics for a relative novice p  pAlso are there alternatives  betterworse, easierharder  to using a memory stick to  temporarily or permanently  effect this change to Linux from Windows CE on the Mobinnova  If so, and, once again, youd be so kind as to detail how to do so in specifics sufficient for a relative novice, itd be greatly appreciated.p  pIn addition, what version of Arm Linux do you recommend Id prefer a small one given the units limitations. ere are Mobinnova Beam specs Nvidia Tegra2 Dual Cortex A9, 1000 Mhz, 512 MB RAM,  8 GB FLASH.p  pThank you.p
Negative 1655 pSo Im trying to get a grasp of pointersarrays by creating a basic function, codestrendcode, that returns code1code if a substring occurs at the end of a given string and code0code if not. I realize I could accomplish this by measuring the length of a char array, subtracting the length of the substring from that length, and starting my program there, but I kind of want to do it the way my function does it to get a stronger grasp of pointer arithmetic. So here is the programp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt define NELEMSx sizeofx  sizeofx[0]  int strendchar string, char substring, int substringLength     int count keep track of how many number of chars that match in a row     whilestring  0         count  0         whilestring  substring             if count  1  substringLength return 1 if matches  length of str             count              string              substring               if count  0 string only increment outer loop if inner loop has done no work     else          substring  count reset substring, dont increment string... BUGGY                    return 0   int main     char string[]  John Coltrane     char substring[]  Coltrane     int substringLength  NELEMSsubstring     printfd n, strendstring, substring, substringLength     char string2[]  John Coltrane is Awesome Coltrane     char substring2[]  Coltrane     int substringLength2  NELEMSsubstring     printfd n, strendstring2, substring2, substringLength2     return 1  codepre  pFor the first test strings, string and substring, I get the right result, returning 1 because Coltrane is at the end of the string. Similarly, if I take the Coltrane out of string2, I get the correct result, returning 0 because the string does not end with Coltrane. p  pHowever, for the version of string2 that you see above, I also get zero, and the problem lies in the fact that codestrendcode does not reset codesubstringcode after I iterate over it and increment it while it matches part of the main string. This is fine when the first instance of substring is at the end of the string, but not when there are two instances, as in string2. I thought that codesubstring  countcode would decrement the pointer back to the beginning of the substring array, but it does not appear to be doing that. p  pIf I change that expression with codesubstringcode, it does show the last character of the substring, but is an expression like codeforint i  0 i lt count i, substringcode really the only way to do this  p  pEdit Replacing codesubstring  countcode with codefor count gt 0 count, substringcode seems like a pretty elegant one liner and it works for me, but I still have a gut feeling theres a better way. p

Negative 1655 pI know you guys like getting specific questions about something, but I cant figure out exactly what it is that Im doing wrong. Maybe its a lack of understanding, so I thought I could use some more sets of eyes. Im trying to make what is called a DropOut stack in python, Where the value entered at the top pops out the value on the bottom, much like the process used by an Undo function in a program.

Thus, a rewrite rule might be in pseudocode codechange a to e when last char is s and next char is dcode.

However, when there are conditions, things become very ugly very quick. Is there some easy recursive way to do the rewriting, or is this nearly impossible in the rewriting phase and I should probably fix my DSL interpreter Note my DSL has ways to get the nth letter before and after the current charp

At present all is functional but I want to replace the links after the message that allow one to delete, reply, archive and other functions. At present the links are all text. I can use small images and make them look nicer. However on a busy front page with lots of messages and threads a whole bunch of images will make the whole page look overwhelming. p  pThe way it works for now is each iteration of the call to function that reads a message from db will start a ul and this allows me to nicely pad the child messages and the depth.p  pHere is what I want to do  create a small popup menu that will show up when someone hovers over the actual message. Because my current way of showing threaded messages using ul and li when I tried to use jqueryui menu widget it wrecks the formatting.p  pSorry about all the rambling but is there a way to show a slim line of links above a message when someone hovers over it and each message in the page will obviously need to have different links [to allow blah.phpmessageid...].p  pI have been looking at jqueryui and learnt it to a tiny extent and still reading the tutorial. Is there a way of doing what I asked abovep  pThanksp

Negative 1655 pSo Im trying to build this page without using tables but its proving to be quite difficult getting everything to be lined up and stay in one place, all while being able to be resized based on the screen resolution of the viewer. Ive placed my code on JSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netDfKSE relnofollowhereap  pEverything was good until I got to the education section and the footer. I dont know why its behaving differently since I copied the code for education from the work info but somehow it is. It seems to have this big space at the top when viewing in JSFiddle and not when I view it in a browser. Also, when I make the browser window smaller, it stays in one place and the text from the work section overlaps it. I want everything to resize and move downwards if the window is made smaller, not just overlap each other. Here is the CSS for those sections but there is more on JSFiddlep  precodecontact      margin 0 auto     textaligncenter     width37   education      width115px     height115px     backgroundcolordfadec     margintop1160px     marginbottom70px   education p      colorFFF     fontsize16px     paddingleft10px     letterspacing0px     verticalalignmiddle     paddingtop47px     fontweight600  eddesc      positionabsolute     left140px     top1660px     width450px     fontsize12px     textalignjustify     lineheight18px  codepre  pAnd for the footer, it was in a table and whatever I did made it look proper on my screen but if I resize, it doesnt move. It just stays in one place so it gets cut off. I also feel like my code is a mess with all the padding and margins but maybe thats normal when using this many divs.. p  pIf anyone can offer advice on how I can clean this up and make it more responsive yet be in this same layout, Id really appreciate it.

Negative 1655 pRecently I faced a problem in a Cbased python extension while trying to instantiate objects without calling its constructor  which is a emrequirementem of the extension. p  pThe class to be used to create instances is obtained dynamically at some point, I have an instance codexcode whose class I wish to use to create other instances, so I store codex.classcode for later use  let this value be codeklasscode. p  pAt a later point, I invoke codePyInstanceNewRawklass, PyDictNewcode and then, the problem arises. It seems that if codeklasscode is an oldstyle class, the result of that call is the desired new instance. However, if it is a newstyle class, the result is NULL and the exception raised isp  blockquote   pSystemError ..Objectsclassobject.c521 bad argument to internal functionp blockquote  pFor the record, Im using Python version code2.7.5code. Googling around, I observed no more than one other person looking for a solution and it seemed to me he was doing a workaround, but didnt detailed it.p  pFor the record 2 the instances the extension is creating are proxies for these same codexcode instances  the codex.classcode and codex.dictcodes are known, so the extension is spawning new instances based on codeclasscode using the aforementioned C function and setting the respective codedictcode to the new instance those codedictcodes have interprocess sharedmemory data. Not only is conceptually problematic to call an instances codeinitcode a second time first its state is already know, second the expected behavior for ctors is that they should be called exactly once for each instance, it is also impractical, since the extension cannot figure out the arguments and their order to call the codeinitcode for each instance in the system. Also, changing the codeinitcode of each class in the system whose instances may be proxies and making them aware there is a proxy mechanism they will be subjected to is conceptually problematic they shouldnt know about it and impractical.p  pSo, my question is how to perform the same behavior of codePyInstanceNewRawcode regardless of the instances class stylep

I already found out that the old VSIX manifest can be edited manually to allow the extension to additionally install to VS 20122013  this works perfectly.p  pHowever some of the VS 2010 APIs I am currently using are not compatible with VS 2012 and I need to update them  with the effect of giving up backward compatibility.p  pstrongMy question is How should I structure my solution and VSIX so that It will be compatible with VS 2010, 2012 and 2013. Would it work to have one DLL targeting VS 2010 and one DLL targeting VS 20122013 and picking the one to use at extension load timestrong p  pemSide note I am using MEF to compose my internal functional units. Does that make it easier in any wayemp

Negative 1655 pAn answer to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21028144whenisdeletingatemplateinstantiationpreferabletodeletinganontemplatea question I had about deleting functions a mentioned how member function templates cant be specialized at class scope.

For example, is it possible to have a public member function template and a private specialization of that templatep

When I test the split and merge methods in the MergeSorter class independently, everything seems to work splitting a list consisting of 0 or 1 element is not working and is driving me crazy but this is not needed for mergesorting. The mergeSort method, however, is not working and I cant seem to figure out way. I tried to debug it myself and theres seems to be a problem when two halves are merged into one list and then the recursion returns. The newly merged list should be referenced by either the left or right variable of the current mergeSort call but instead I get only the last element instead of the whole list.p

Negative 1655 pI had a table with 3 columns and 23 million rows. Each single row contains a primary key, int value, and a one single word, that is it. Each word is 3 characters long. In other words, each words Hash Representation was there. The Table size was 5 GB. This table is well indexed.p  pNow I am going to create the same table with real words in it, no more 3 character hash. So each word will contain their normal number of letters. Now this table contains 23 million rows, 3 columns. However since the length of the words is more than the 3 character hash, the size of the table is 15 GB. This table is well indexed.p  pThe only difference between these 2 tables is that in first table, the data type of the codeHashcode is codechar3code. Now in the second table, the data type of the nonhashedword is codevarchar20code.p  pNow please have a look at the below code, which we ran in our previous table I mentioned.

Negative 1655 pI have a copy  paste loop for line items in an Excel file that exports data from these line items into an Excelbased form and saves each form by the value in Row B. My issue is that these line items are divided into 3 different tables on the same sheet, each with a different number of line items to be copied. Furthermore, each table is separated by 2 blank rows.p  pWhat I need the macro to do for me p  ol liStart at line 17 and copy all line items in the first table until it hits a blank row  this varies from 1 to 600 rows.li liSkip to SecondTable and perform the same functions.li liRepeat for ThirdTableli ol  pIgnore some of the declarations as I deleted a large chunk of code for readability. I figured I would need 3 separate copypaste loops to accomplish this Ive only included 2 here and I tried using .Find to reference the start of the secondthird tables.

Negative 1655 pI have seen in several places, including the source code of CCSpriteBatchNode that it is expensive to addremove childs from it.  My understanding is that the whole point of using batch nodes is to prevent expensive OpenGL calls from happening over and over when many sprites from the same sprite sheet are being added to the same container.p  pWhat I am wondering is 1 how expensive is adding  removing childs to a sprite batch node, and 2 when is it considered a appropriate to make use of onep  pFor example, I have a laser object which creates ten sprites...  as it moves across the screen, it showshides the current sprite for that given screen position.  When it reaches the far right edge of the screen, the laser object is discarded, and so are the ten sprites.  So, I was wondering, is this a case where a sprite batch node would be not appropriate to use because its only 10 sprites, and it happens so fast  The move animation is 0.2 seconds, so that if the player were to rapidly fire, that would mean addingremoving 10 sprites to a batch node over and over...p  pIn other cases, I have a SpriteBatchNode already setup for various objects, and occasionally I come across a oneoff sprite that needs to be added, and it just happens to be part of the same sprite sheet, so I am tempted to add it to that batch node since its there, and its designated to that particular sprite sheet already......  Anyway, Id love to get some clarification on this topic.p

Negative 1655 pHi Im programming a parallax effect on a web site for a client, this site needs to run over IE8 and all major modern browsers, the problem is that I am using backgroundposition to do the parallax.p  pIE8 only supports backgroundpositony or x and firefox only support backgroundposition, so I read the documentation on jquery page and they do not recommend to detect browser, instead they recommend to detect property support, so I read the documentation of Modernzr but it seems that there isnt a validation either for backgroundposition IE9, and modern browsers or backgroundpositionx or y IE8p  pDo you know a good practice or library to detect backgroundposition or backgroundpositiony or x supportp  pThanksp
Negative 1655 pNow that the Cutoff date plugin for Sonar is deprecated Ive tried it, and it doesnt seem to work at all, strongis there any way to exclude issues based on a set datestrong p  pFor a large project, it is desirable to really start at fresh at given point.  Maintaining a low alert threshold  lt 100 alerts  is much more manageable for the developers than cluttering the issues listings with old historylow priority issues. 1500. Identifying the new and relevant ones are then much harder.p  pWhat we want to focus on are new issues.  Example  when you have changed the quality rules for say 200.000 lines of code, you really only are interested in what is produced from now on and changes to already existing code that breaks the new rules. p

Negative 1655 pI would like to fetch this URL, which is strongNOTstrong hyperlinked, from this contentless webpage.

Examplep  blockquote   p[CLICK URL] http58www.example.comp blockquote  pSo, technically what I want to do is to use the URL for the redirect address and at the same time it excludes the short text from interfering. To sum it up, it fetches the URL from the webpage and blocks out the [CLICK URL] to be able to use the full URL as the redirect address.p  pIm not too sure, but I think it should look something like this incomplete and not workingp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt var web  window.location.href  actionraw  Where the text and URL are located var txt  web.getElementByIdelement var range  web.createRange url  range.selectNodeContentstxt window.location.href  url  Used the provided URL for the redirect address ltscriptgt codepre  pAs you can see, this is an embedded script, an external script is strongly recommended.

Negative 1655 pThere are some externally sourced Java classes that happen to be defined all in the default unnamed package, i.e. there are no codepackage ...code statement at the top of the code.javacode source files where these Java classes are defined.  I use these as dependencies in my Java project. The few Java classes I write for my project are also placed in the default unnamed package.  I use IntelliJ IDEA 13.1 to work on this project and set the code.jarcode file containing the external Java classes as a library and project dependency.  However, I dont know how to configure Gradle so it properly handles the dependency. Currently, I just manually added a configuration for the project as a regular Java Application.  Clicking on Run using the configuration compiles and runs the project OK.p

So my problem isnt lack of computational power but rather memory limitation.p  pMy question is, whether it is even possible to use some R package like doSnow for implicit parallelisation to use 23 nodes to increase the RAM limit or would I have to rewrite the script from ground to make it explicit parallelised p  pSorry if my question is naive, any suggestions are welcomed.p  pThanks,p  pSimonp

The problem is, no matter what I try I just cant get things to work.p  pI tried this first p  precodefor body in self.physicsBody.allContactedBodies as [SKPhysicsBody]    codepre  pBut I get this error.p  blockquote   pfatal error array cannot be downcast to array of derivedp blockquote  pI also tried thisp  precodefor object in self.physicsBody.allContactedBodies       let body  object as SKPhysicsBody  codepre  pBut this also crashes with the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGqnbf.png altenter image description herep  pAnd similarly I tried thisp  precode for object in self.physicsBody.allContactedBodies        let body  object as SKPhysicsBody    codepre  pThere is no crash, but body becomes nil.p  pAnd if I dont cast at all, I dont get a crash. For examplep  precodefor object in self.physicsBody.allContactedBodies     codepre  pBut obviously I need to cast if I want to use the actual type.p  pbrp  pSo then as a test I just tried thisp  precodelet object AnyObject  SKPhysicsBody let body  object as SKPhysicsBody codepre  pAnd this also results in the same crash that is in the picture.p  pbrp  pBut other types wont crash. For example, this wont crash.p  precodelet object AnyObject  SKNode let node  object as SKNode codepre  pSo my question is, stronghow can I correctly loop through the allContactedBodies arraystrongp  pEdit I am running Xcode 6 beta 4 on iOS 8 beta 4 device.p  pstrongEdit 2 More Informationstrongp  pOk so I just did some more testing. I tried thisp  precodelet bodies  self.physicsBody.allContactedBodies as [SKPhysicsBody] codepre  pIf allContactedBodies is empty, then the cast is successful. But if allContactedBodies contains objects, then the cast fails and bodies will become nil, so I cant loop through it. It seems that currently it is just NOT POSSIBLE to cast AnyObject to SKPhysicsBody, making it impossible to loop through the allContactedBodies array, unless someone can provide a workaround.p  pEdit 3 Bug still in Xcode 6 beta 5.

Negative 1655 pI have a multithreaded application where the main thread creates a few threads and hands them off to the ExecutorService. All the threads use a Oracle Database connection object in the main class. The database connection is opened once and all the methods in the other threads use the main database object.p  pHowever once the application starts running and processing the records, I see that the number of cursors open keeps increasing until 2000  I set this limit in Oracle  and then results in the ORA1000 message which do not go away until I restart the application.

Negative 1655 pIn Mandrill, if you create a new API key and do not limit its API calls, whoever you give that key to can use it to log into the web interface with full access  billing information, account information, the works.p  pAfter playing around, it looks like you can disable the web interface login functionality by ticking Only Allow This Key To Use Certain API Calls and then selecting at least one API call. Doesnt matter which one.p  pSo I can give full access to the account, or completely disable their ability to log in. Is there any way to customize this further I would like to be able to limit users to the outboundinbound UI, or at least prevent them from having the ability to charge many thousands of dollars to the attached credit card. For clarification, my use case is to distribute API keys to contractors or vendors so that all email gets sent through a single account.p  pI have found very little official Mandrill documentation on this. The only thing that seemed relevant is that if you have a Mailchimp account, you can instead send users there and use the View Mandrill Reports functionality. I dont have Mailchimp nor do I need it, so this seems like an unnecessary hacky workaround.p

Negative 1655 pIve used SO to help me solve programming frustrations for years now and this feels like the first time Ive had an issue thats unique to me alone or at least that noone else has asked about. Anyway, heres my issue below and Id be very grateful for any help anyone can offer. p  pIve been trying for the past 24 hours or so to implement Google Game Services in my existing Android app. I followed the instructions provided by Google with regards to setting up the app in the developer console, using the signing certificate key, linking it to my app in the store, put the application ID into my Eclipse project in the location and all of that. I derive from the BaseGameActivity class as recommended and my project compiles fine with no errors. I also use the FacebookSDK and AdMobGoogle ads using the new Google services library. I cant think of anything I havent done that could explain my error  which is as follows...p  pWhen my app opens and attempts to sign in, it pops up and asks for permissionsauthorization as normal but once I grant these permissions it says Failed to sign in. Please check your network connection and try again.. This has happened every time for the past 24 hours as Ive been trying little tweaks here and there hoping to make a difference. Im 100  sure theres no problem with my network connection as implied by the error message.p  pP.S. It did seem to connectsign in one random time and I got the welcome message but by the time it got to the next activity in my app it seemed to have signed out again and the error message returned. Ive also checked from the Google side and I can see where I have indeed granted my app permissions which implies that I did sign in successfully and authorize it properly so I cant understand the error messages Im getting within the game itself.p  pI know this was very long but I wanted to be as thorough with my explanation as possible  can anyone please advice me on how to deal with this p

Negative 1655 pFirst off want to say thank you to this site in general, just started programming and Haskell for a month this site helped tremendously, my exam is tomorrow so ill appreciate it if more of you step up to help This is the question from the practice paper   p  precodeThe following table gives the names, grades and age of people employed by a  company   Name       Grade     Age  Able       Director  47  Baker      Manager   38  Charles    Trainee   19  Dunn       Director  50  Egglestone Manager   42   i. Define a Haskell type suitable for representing the information in such a  table [10]   A function avAge is required to find the average age of people in a given grade,  for instance in the example the average age of managers is 40. Give three  alternative Haskell definitions for this function   ii. using explicit recursion, [20]  iii. using mapping functions, [20]  iv. using list comprehensions. [20] codepre  pThe table isnt very clear as I couldnt paste the proper table but you can basically see there are 3 columns and multiple rows, one for name, one for grade, one for age. So as you can see the first question i is to define a haskell type that is suitable for representing an information in such a table. Keep in my that the real table has lines of course.p  pSo how do I define a function to do this Does define a function mean e.g. [String]  String  Int or I have to write up a function that does something p  pFinally, about the avAGe to find the average age of people what are the ideas behind doing it with mapping functions I have planned out for explicit recursion but Im really struggling to fit mapping functions map, foldr, filter, etc to this. p

Negative 1655 pMy existing Android Java game pits the player against up to eight AI opponents.  Ive now decided to implement an asynchronous online turnbased multiplayer mode.  As I currently support leaderboards and achievements through Google Play Game Services I was hoping to use their turnbased multiplayer API but this has proved far from ideal due to the following restrictions within that API p  ul liEvery player has to remain in the app for the duration of the gameli liOnly one multiplayer game can be played at onceli ul  pMy game is of the type where you might play a turn and then close the game down until a notification comes in to say that its your turn again.  Also, for an eight player game its unlikely that all eight instances are going to remain running throughout the duration of an entire game.  Its also likely that a player will want to participate in a number of different games at once.  Although the game is nothing like Draw Something, their multiplayer model is similar to the type that I need.p  pHaving dismissed the possibility of using the turnbased API, Ive been looking into other possibilities and have come across App Engine.  Unfortunately 99 of my developer experience is with clientside coding so some of these questions may seem naive...p  ol lipIs it possible to integrate Google Play Game Services with Google App Engine  I would ideally like to keep everything tied to each players Google account seeing as Im already using Google Play Game Services for achievements and leaderboards.pli lipIs App Engine suitable for allowing multiple instances of asynchronous turnbased gamespli lipWill I be able to use parts of the multiplayer API such as the lobby system or will it all need to be written from scratchpli lipHow much of a learning curve will be involved with setting up the backend system  What resources will I needpli ol  pAny advice on the above will be very gratefully received.p

The compiler can then just replace the use of   lastPrice and price in the anonymous class with the values of the   constants at compile time, ofcourse, and you wont have the problem   with accessing nonexistent variables anymorep blockquote  pThis made me to wander that is the codefinalcode keyword working like as Macros are in CC.Till now, I was using codefinalcode for variables in a way that whenever I will try to modify themaccidentally I will be getting an error that You cant modify it as it is declared as codefinalcode.But this replacement thing is not clear to me.p  pstrongQuestionstrong According to the selected answer from the above link answerer saysp  blockquote   pThis is why it doesnt workp      pThe variables lastPrice and price are local variables in the main   method. The object that you create with the anonymous class might last   until after the main method returns.p      pWhen the main method returns, local variables such as lastPrice and   price will be cleaned up from the stack, so they wont exist anymore   after main returns.p      pBut the anonymous class object references these variables. Things   would go horribly wrong if the anonymous class object tries to access   the variables after they have been cleaned up.p blockquote  pp  h2Where this storage is taking place for replacement laterWho is taking care of itfinal variables are just replaced by valuesh2  pp

Negative 1655 pOn Cordova 3.6, with IOS SDK 8.1, I am observing that after calling geolocation.watchPosition, I may get either 12 geolocationSuccess results, or a geolocationError kCLErrorDomain error 0, or timeout. If I get those 12 success results, then nothing else fires again until an error timeout. After the error, nothing else fires again. If I call clearWatch and watchPosition again, then the process repeats.p  pWhat is going on here I would expect to keep getting periodic geolocationSuccess calls, and if there is a geolocationError then I should at least keep getting updates either with success or failure. Why does the event firing stop, and I have to reset it by creating a new watch I actually get the best results by just calling geolocation.getCurrentPosition periodically using my own timer.p  pI did notice in the debugger that the location manager delegate is logging locationManagerdidFailWithError null right after calling watchPosition, even if I later get geolocationSuccess.p  pThis occurs on both iPhone 6 running iOS 8.1, as well as iPod Touch 4 running iOS 6.p  pThe relevant code is straightforwardp  precodevar geoWatchID  navigator.geolocation.watchPositiongeolocationSuccess,     geolocationError,          maximumAge 5000,         timeout 60000,         enableHighAccuracy true      codepre

Negative 1655 pA user logs in using default Laravel authentication, which puts an encrypted cookie in the browser, and saves the session in the database.p  pThe user moves to a classic asp page, where I check the cookie value, get the hash, and call the laravel app back passing the session id hash.p  pThen I use that in laravel to see if theres an active session for that id, and if so I return true, so the user can be logged in, in classic asp.p  pOn each page request in the classic app, I check the lastupdatedtime in the db and update it on each page.

The problem here is that I have to combine the results after all calls have returned, which is potentially slow.li liI could create a collection resource within my main resource by posting my list of IDs to POST resourcecollection, then use a GET resourcecollectionid call to retrieve the results.

Negative 1655 pLong story short, I have done several prototypes of interactive software. I use pygame now python sdl wrapper and everything is done on CPU. I am starting to port it to C now and at the same time search for the existing possibilities to use some GPU power to entlast the CPU from redundant operations. However I cannot find a good guideline what exact technologytools should I pick in my situation. I just read plethora of docs, it drains my mental powers very fast. I am not sure if it is possible at all, so Im puzzled.br Here Ive made a very rough sketch of my typical application skeleton that I develop, but given that it uses GPU now note, I have almost zero practical knowledge about GPU programming. Still important is that data types and functionality must be exactly preserved. Here it isbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoLFqw.png altenter image description herep  pSo FA,R,P is some custom function, for example element substitution, repetition, etc. Function is presumably constant in program lifetime,  rectangles shapes generally are not equal with A shape, so it is not inplace calculation. So they are simply generated whith my functions. Examples of F repeat rows and columns of A substitute values with values from Substitution tables compose some tiles into single array any math function on A values, etc. As said all this can be easily made on CPU, but app must be really smooth. BTW in pure Python it became just unusable after adding several visual features, which are based on numpy arrays. Cython helps to make fast custom functions but then the source code is already kind of a salad.p  pQuestion  p  ul lipDoes this schema reflect some standart technologydev.tools  pli lipIs CUDA what I am looking for If yes, some linksexamples strongwhich coincidesstrong whith my application structure, would be great.pli ul  pI realise, this a big question, so I will give more details if it helps.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong   p  pHere is a concrete example of two typical calculations for my prototype of bitmap editor. So the editor works with indexes and the data include layers with corresponding bit masks. I can determine the size of layers and masks are same size as layers and, say, all layers are same size strong10242 pixelsstrong  4 MB for 32 bit values. And my palette is say, strong1024 elementsstrong 4 Kilobytes for 32 bpp format.br Consider I want to do two things now  p  pstrongStep 1strong. I want to flatten all layers in one. Say A1 is default layer background and layers A2 and A3 have masks m2 and m3. In python id write p  precodefrom numpy import logicalnot ... Result  A1  logicalnotm2  A2  m2  logicalnotm3  A3  m3 codepre  pSince the data is independent I believe it must give speedup proportionl to number of parallel blocks. p  pstrongStep 2strong. Now I have an array and want to colorize it with some palette, so it will be my lookup table. As I see now, there is a problem with simultanous read of lookup table element.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1H6a6.png altenter image description herep  pBut my idea is, probably one can just duplicate the palette for all blocks, so each block can read its own palette Like this  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFoEA1.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1655 pNeed help with formatting this properly...  So this webpageapplication generates a small set of boxes that serves as a basic graph for trending resource usage. p  pThe gHolder and graphContainer are fixed, and the graphBar classes are generated one per second up to a fixed number of bars I only included a few for brevity  At the end of that there should be an overall percentage in a box Also generated in Javascriptp  pCurrently I can make this work if I have a fixed number of graphBar entries that are less then the smallest screen resolution I expect. p  pId like to make this dynamically size... but unfortunately, when I try and make the container equal the size of the available area... It either leaves a great big empty area... or If I have more graphBar entries then it can display it wraps them rather than hiding the overflow. p  pI currently have it using the CSS Table functions which is I assume the problem... but I cannot seem to make this work any other way. p  pImage of the general shapep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2ElcN.png altCPU Graphp  pBasic HTML structurep  precodeltdiv classgHoldergt   ltdiv classgraphContainer idCPUHistoryGraphgt     ltdiv classgraphBar percentlow styleheight6pxgtltdivgt     ltdiv classgraphBar percentlow styleheight6pxgtltdivgt     ltdiv classgraphBar percentlow styleheight7pxgtltdivgt     ltdiv classgraphBar percentlow styleheight5pxgtltdivgt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classgraphSingle idstatusminiCPUgraph stylewidth 5pxgtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pHere is a jfiddle of the problem.

Negative 1655 pChrome app newbie here...p  pOne of the first things I am trying to figure out is how to have multiple instances of a chrome app running at the same time.p  pGoogling reveals numerous people asking how to prevent multiple instances, and refer to adding a singleton true in the launcher .js file.  My apps are singleton already, and adding singleton false seems to have no effect.  Other references suggest that if an id is present, it will be forced as singleton.  However, removing the id seems to have no effect for me, either.p  pExperimenting with the simple a hrefhttpsdeveloper.chrome.comappsfirstapp relnofollowhelloworld tutoriala, which has neither an id or singleton, even this app only runs as a singleton. I am launching the app with google loadandlaunchapphomemehelloworld.  If I run that command multiple times, it simply brings the original app to the front and center.p  pIf someone can explain how to make the tutorial run multiple instances, then hopefully I can apply that to the larger preexisting project Im starting to look at.p

Negative 1655 pIm building an application that has Angular on the frontend and Laravel on the back.

Ive seen how this works on LaravelBlade where you can chain methods and then access the users fullname because of the Eloquent relationship of hasMany or belongsTo, but I cant seem to figure out how to do this while returning a JSON to the Angular side. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1655 pSo Im trying to run a sequence of commands from one computer to another using VMware VIX API with Perl and Bash but having trouble getting the actual sequence of commands working.

This basically grabs the name of an unformatted drive and then formats it. Ive tried countless combinations of trying to use codeechocode, codebashcode, or codeevalcode to run the commands along with trying different combinations of double and single quotes with all kinds of backslash escapes, all to no avail. Its odd, because if I just try to copy and paste the command in to the actual VM, it works fine, but this command from another is failing to do anything. I think maybe it might have to be a oneliner to work but Im pretty new to bash and not sure how to format that with loops and whatnot.p  pI checked the error codes and its 0 no error for everything, including opening the VM, checking for VMware tools, logging in to the guest, running the program, and then logging out. Also, if I change the script to just echo to a simple file, it works fine, so I know these two systems can communicate. I believe the answer has to do with quotesescapingbackslashes causing misreads when translated across systems but Im not sure since theres no error messages being thrown.p

Negative 1655 pSo, Ive just began learning codeAngularcode and my question is what ways or the best practices are there for injecting helper functions into AngularJS I often need to include functions to assist my controller, but I have read online that the controller should hold as little logic as possible, which means they should be injected into the controller and declared in the module fat module, skinny controller. p  pAs such, I have been primarily injecting functions like thisp  h3provide.valueh3  precodeprovide.valueMySQLtoJS, functiondatetimeString      var t  datetimeString.split[ ]     var d  new Datet[0], t[1]1, t[2], t[3], t[4], t[5]     return d  codepre  pThis uses the codeprovidecode service to create a codevaluecode that can be injected in my controller. However, for more elaborate functions, such as those that require an injectable, I have been using thisp  h3codeFactorycode providerh3  precode.factoryconvertMySQLToJS, [moment, functionmoment      return functionarrayInput          if Array.isArrayarrayInput              for var i  0 i lt arrayInput.length i                  var t  arrayInput[i].begindatetime.split[ ]                 var start  new Datet[0], t[1]1, t[2], t[3], t[4], t[5]                 arrayInput[i].begindatetime  start                 var t  arrayInput[i].enddatetime.split[ ]                 var end  new Datet[0], t[1]1, t[2], t[3], t[4], t[5]                 arrayInput[i].enddatetime  end                   Also create the moment message                 if arrayInput[i].begindatetime gt new Date                      arrayInput[i].message  Begins at   momentarrayInput[i].begindatetime.formatMMMM Do YYYY, hmm a   and likely ends at   momentarrayInput[i].enddatetime.formatMMMM Do YYYY, hmm a                                  else                      arrayInput[i].message  Began at   momentarrayInput[i].begindatetime.formatMMMM Do YYYY, hmm a   and likely ended at   momentarrayInput[i].enddatetime.formatMMMM Do YYYY, hmm a                                           return arrayInput               ] codepre  pHowever, factories are often used for their service and properties like codehttpcode, or so Ive been told. So Ive been recently suggested by some people that I should be including them in the coderuncode configuration block which seems a bit weird to me by using coderootScopecode and giving it that property for the function I need. Since Im new to Angular and Ive found documentation rather lacking, Im wondering how am I supposed to inject helper functions correctly into codeAngularcode, if there is a correct wayp

If I check in Xcodepreferencesaccountsmy account I can see that new profile there.li liIve added new iOS app in iTunes Connect. I used my AppID Ive created before as my Bundle ID. As for version, I just put 1.0 there just as it says in my app Version 1.0 Build 1li liUsed some random SKU.li liIn Xcode I archived my App but there was no button to submit it to TestFlight. I could only export the .ipa file, validate it, upload to App Store or Download dSYMs if I click that one it would say that an app record for appID was found but a matching version for 1.0 build 1 was not.li ol  pSo what have I done wrong here Is it the version Should Ive put there not just 1.0 but 1.0 1 insteadp  pUpdate Could the reason be that I didnt activate TestFlight Betap  pThanks.p

Negative 1655 pIm trying to write use Django codeFormViewcode and a bit of ingenuity to create a view which will allow me to get inputs from a user that will be fed to a function.  Id like the code to be reusable, so Id like to make a view that will be able to take a target function as a parameter and automagically create a form appropriate to that function.  There is more plumbing to be done, but the general idea would bep  precodeclass FormViewForFunctionFormView     templatename  ...     func  None      def getformclassself         class FunctionFormforms.Form             pass          a  inspect.getargspecself.func         for argname in a[args]             setattrFunctionForm, argname, forms.CharField         return FunctionForm codepre  pThe idea would be that then you could set up something in your URLConf that used codeFormViewForFunction.asviewfuncinsert any function you wantcode and you would wind up being presented with a form that was appropriate for specifying parameters for that function.  Lets not worry about what would happen on form submission.  For now Im just stuck getting the form to generate properly.p  pWith the code above, the form doesnt wind up having any fields  What am I doing wrongp
