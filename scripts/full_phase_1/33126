Positive 33126 pIm currently creating a c .net class to replace all of the connection strings we use for our various environments.

Positive 33126 pI have migrated the my project from LinqtoSQL to Entity Framework 6. After resolving so many problems, I finally came to one I am not sure what to do with it. After conversion about one third of my unit tests are failing because stored procedures returning scalar values a hrefhttpwww.devtoolshed.comusingstoredproceduresentityframeworkscalarreturnvalues relnofollowjust work different waya.p  pIn LinqtoSQL, the stored procedure return the returned value. In EF they return number of rows affected. There are workarounds which requires changing the stored procedure generally from codeRETURN retvaluecode to codeSELECT retvaluecode. But this requires changes in TSQL. The project still contains some legacy code from old days of ASP.NET like codeaspnetMembershipCreateUsercode and so on. It means that I cannot change these stored procedures, because there are partly used by ASP.NET ADO.NET Membership provider, partly by the LinqtoSQL code. The solution I consider is to make TSQL wrappers of these parts legacy code.p  pAnother reason why I would like to keep the stored procedure unchanged is the possibility of reverting to previous commit if the upgrade to EF is not successful. A dont want to change database forth and back again. But this reason is not so strong, it is only about my laziness.p  pI know that membership provider is old fashioned but I cannot rewrite entire application in one commit, I need to keep it stable.p  pThe best way to finish the migration would be to call the stored procedure from EF like LinqtoSQL, but I didnt found a way how to it. The EF disappointed me in this. How is possible that after years of development EF does not support returning scalar value from stored procedure p  pHow would you solved this issuep

Positive 33126 pI have a seemingly odd issue here. Im new to LinqtoSQL, so I might be missing something obvious. p  pI have a DataContext dbml representing the tables in my database, and one of these tables represents a log table which accumulates a lot of records. Simply adding this table to the dbml appears to populate every record from the database into the DataContext object and therefore my viewmodel, since the datacontext is a member of the viewmodel. p  pI never noticed this until I serialized the viewmodel into XML and noticed the file size was rather large for the data contained in the viewmodel. p  pOpening up the XML revealed every single log record from this table was present, despite not being referenced anywhere except the initialization of the LinqtoSQL datacontext object table is not referenced. p  pI havent yet checked if other tables are doing the same thing other tables are very small since this project and database is still new, but the log table stood out as 80 of the size of the serialized file. p  pThis is also worrying, since it is being queried and stored in memory, costing me additional performance. This will be a big problem once the software is in use and the database grows at a large rate. p  pAny ideas on to how to prevent LinqtoSQL from pulling in every record Thanks.p

Negative 33126 pstrongIn briefstrongp  pIs it ever excusable to have assembly names and class names stored in the database Does it break the layers of an application for the data layer to have explicit knowledge of the internals of the business layerp  pstrongFull explanationstrongp  pI have a boot strapper that runs jobs classes that inherit from a common base that exist in separate assemblies. The jobs have configuration parameters stored in the database to allow their operation to be altered by means of a GUI.p  pIn order to locate and run a job, the boot strapper has an app.config file that contains the name of the job, and the assembly name and class name that defines it.p  pI have been asked to move the assembly name and class name into the database so that we can get rid of the app.config file. Reason given is to keep all configuration in the one place  the database. p  pHowever, the boot strapper is the only code that will run the job and this configuration information will never be changed after deployment. I think that putting such information into the database gives the data layer too much information about the layers above, and will get in the way of refactoring and maintenance. However, I know that Windows Workflow Foundation does exactly this, and so perhaps I am wrong to think it is a poor practicep  pstrongEditstrongp  pIn answer to a question below, the database connection string is stored in a separate config file that is managed by a shared configuration framework. This framework makes it technically possible to remove the app.config file completely.p

Negative 33126 pI am currently working on building a proof of concept search solution for my company using Lucene and Hibernate Search. I have built individual components which work fine. I am now looking at creating a single API that would allow a user to get search results back from different sources domain  data. What I would like to achieve is something like a search manager fires search requests to different search components asynchronously and when one set of results have been processed return that result to the user while processing the rest. Once the result of the search has been processed notify the client that there are more search results available. p  pI am wondering whether I have a search manager which creates separate threads to search individual search components and keeps a list of search results.

Any additional search results added would involve the search manager pushing the results to the user.p  pI am not looking for any code example any would be appreciated but I was wondering if I could get some guidance on how to tackle this problem. Do I use event processing technologies GigaSpaces, Spring, JMS or use standard Java concurrent libraries. What would be the effective way of managing the list and push the updated results.p  pCheersp

Negative 33126 pIBM Cognos TM1 is a multidimensional database that my company thinks is the latest and greatest. Ive been to the classes and, sure, it is nice for analysis. Of course the finance people in my company only see the Excel AddIn or Excellike website and think thats all I need for a data entry application My response is I thought you need an OLTP solution which they ignore because Im in IT.p  pWhat I see is something that has questionable integration with my preferred Microsoft development tools. Id rather deploy a Silverlight data entryOLTP tool. I also see that TM1 has unmanaged dlls that provide full access into the data engine. Since IBM bought TM1, I dont see a friendly future for Microsoft and TM1.p  pIs it completely irrational to think LinqToEntities could create an ORM to TM1 Is LinqToEntities ever used to point at a multidimensional database What about nHibernate I would like to say to our finance people, sure lets use TM1 and Ill use it as the backend of the data entry application that I create for you.p

Negative 33126 pI have a GUI application in swing, implemented in NetBeans. For the various functionality provided from the input of the user, a jar is used, which uses log4j for logging. All is ok, but I have to redirect information from log4j to a text area in my GUI. I have found that to redirect from log4j to swing text area, one must extend an AppenderSkeleton. My problem is that I can not modify the gui so as to have a JTextArea that extends an AppenderSkeleton for example so I have to have such a class that appends to my JTextarea. Now my application initializes strongbeforestrong log4j. My problem is that I can not find a way to set as property to the AppenderSkeleton custom class, a reference to the jtextarea of my gui , so that when log4j initializes the appender, it will pass a reference to the applications text area. I tried in the log4J configuration file something like log4j.appender.myAppender.theTextAreapath.to.myFrameclass.theTextArea hopping that log4j would call the setter in my appender and the getter from my frame to set the text area, but it does not work. How can I make the appender initialized by log4j, redirect info to my application Or is there a way for my application to initialize the custom appender and notify log4j to use it for logging Thank youp

There are, however, some rules to thisp  ulliEach post can link to multiple websitesliliEach post can only link to websites that do not have a post linking back to itliliEach post can link to the same website multiple times so if its been linked in the past, thats fineliliA website can link to its own postsliul  pTake below, a representation of my websites, each has a number of posts. img srchttpimg140.imageshack.usimg140815emptyd.jpg p  pNow, if I add all of As possible linksbr  img srchttpimg834.imageshack.usimg8344931alinks.jpg p  pBut now, no other site is able to link back to A, because A is linking to them rule 2.  See below to what C can link tobr  img srchttpimg39.imageshack.usimg39273clinks.jpg p  pSo, now anything that A or C links to cant link back to it, this lowers the options for each of the other sites.  Its important to remember that not every website will link to all possible combinations, I just need these combinations returning from the query.  If you look below Ive added links from G and D, these arent every possible link that they produce, just some that are possible img srchttpimg689.imageshack.usimg6897140dglinks.jpg altD and G linkingp  pIts starting to take shape now.  Youll notice that a lot of websites now link to H, so Hs linking options are very limited.  In fact it can only ever link to F, B, E and itself rule 4.p  pIm not being lazy here and just asking your to write a query for me.  Ive spent a long time trying to work this out and not sure where to start.p  pHeres a link to some sample data and to the table structure a hrefhttppastie.org1506715 relnofollowhttppastie.org1506715ap  pI have been able to produce something close to all outcomes by using a cross joinp  precodeSELECT t1. , t2.  FROM testposts t1, testposts as t2 WHERE t1.postid  t2.postid ORDER BY t1.postid, t2.postid codepre  pI feel like its quite close, but Im just not there.  I think I need to use a NOT EXISTS clause with a subquery, but Im unsure as to exactly what it is I need.  p
Negative 33126 pId like to add implicit conversions to Java classes generated by a modeling tool. So I want to add them to the companion object of those classes, so that the compiler automatically finds them. But I cannot add them in a separate file, because the companion has to be defined in the same file. Is there anything I can do about thisp  pOf course, I can define all my implicit conversions in another object and then bring it into scope, but this requires an extra import. Any other solutionp
Negative 33126 pI am using the Bioconductor package a hrefhttpwww.bioconductor.orgpackagesreleasebiochtmlCMA.html relnofollowCMAa to perform internal, Monte Carlo crossvalidation MCCV on SVM classifiers in a microarray dataset. CMA internally uses the e1071 R package for the SVM work.p  pThe dataset has 387 variables attributes for 45 samples observations which belong to one of two classes labels 0 or 1 at about 11 proportion. All data is numerical with no NAs. I am trying a 1000iteration MCCV with 15 variables selected for SVM using the a hrefhttprss.acs.unt.eduRdoclibrarylimmahtmlebayes.html relnofollowlimma statisticsa for differential gene expression analysis. During MCCV, a fraction of the 45sample set is used for training an SVM classifier, which is then used to test the remaining fraction, and I am trying different values for the trainingset fraction. CMA also performs innerloop validations 3fold crossvalidation within the training sets, by default to finetune the classifiers to be used for crossvalidation against the testsets. All this is done from within the CMA package.p  pSometimes, for low trainingset sizes, CMA shows an error in the console and halts the rest of the code for classification from getting executed.p  pre[snip]tuning iteration 575 tuning iteration 576 tuning iteration 577 Error in predict.svmret, xhold, decision.values  TRUE    Model is empty pre  pIt occurs even when I use a test other than limmas for variable selection, or use two instead of 15 variables for classifier generation. The R code I use should ensure that the trainingsets always have members of both classes. I would appreciate any insight on this.p  pBelow is the R code I use, with Mac OS X 10.6.6, R 2.12.1, Biobase 2.10.0, CMA 1.8.1, limma 3.6.9, and WilcoxCV 1.0.2.

Negative 33126 pSo, I am trying to implement a concurrent queue in C. I have split the methods into read methods and write methods. So, when accessing the write methods, like push and pop, I acquire a writer lock. And the same for the read methods. Also, we can have several readers but only one writer.p  pIn order to get this to work in code, I have a mutex lock for the entire queue. And two condition locks  one for the writer and the other for the reader. I also have two integers keeping track of the number of readers and writers currently using the queue.p  pSo my main question is  how to implement several readers accessing the read methods at the same timep  pAt the moment this is my general read method code In psuedo code  not C.

Negative 33126 pIn my app, I have a ListView with TranscriptMode set to Normal, so when items get added, they appear at the bottom of the list and the list scrolls from the bottom upward. I am using my list such that when the user scrolls the list downward, meaning that they want to go to the top of the list, as soon as I reach the first item in the list, I want to load more items and prepend them into the list, meaning that they appear before the first item, so that the user can keep scrolling until they reach the very first item.p  pI have not been successful at this. As soon as I prepend items and refresh the adapter with notifyDataSetChanged, the ListView adapter requests the very first item in my list.

Is this the only difference What if I just read each byte, compose them into a string and send them I think, only difference will be that not all bytes are String chars, so I wouuld just add an overhead when converting to a Stringp  ptldr  What is the difference between Binary transfer and String transferp

Negative 33126 pI am working on an iOS 5 project and have run into a severe performance problem, reducing my app to lt10fps consistently.  The time profiling tool has identified a call to codeobjcDenseMapcode which seems to have to do with the retainreleaseautorelease system in the ObjectiveC runtime.  This call is taking a massive portion of processing time and I was wondering if anyone has any pointers for resolving this penalty andor ways of avoiding this issue.  I suspect it has something to do with the NSMutableArrays, NSMutableSets, and other mutable collections I am using to manage objects per frame.

Negative 33126 pI am converting a C project created using Visual Studio 2005 to CMake and have stumbled upon a bit of a problem with resource files that are included in the project.p  pThe project includes a code.rccode file, a bunch of code.icocode files and a code.rc2code file.p  pThe regular code.rccode file works fine in the generated project and uses the resource compiler. The code.icocode and code.rc2code files however are causing problems when they are just being included, because in the generated project Visual Studio attempts to compile them using the CC compiler.p  pI assume that these files are included by the code.rccode file, so it would probably work to just not include them in the CMakeLists.txt file, but since it is obviously possible to list them in the project they are visible in the original project I would like to do so, so that the user of the generated project can see that these files are being used.p  pstrongWhat is the correct way to handle these extra VS resource files in CMakestrongp

Each report is going to have various things that need to occur when the page loads. p  pDo I have to put all the page logic into the main page p  pThis is a generic question, but I will give a specific example of what Im trying to do.p  pAn MVC3 codeLayoutcode page has my head element with all script references.p  pThen I have my index pagep  precodeltdiv datarolepage dataaddbackbtntruegt  ltdiv datarolecontentgt     ltdiv classcontentprimarygt         ltul datarolelistview datathemeagt             ltli datarolelistdivider datathemeagtCategory 1ltligt             ltligtlta hrefsomeUrl datatransitionslideupgtLink 1ltagtltligt          ltulgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThen a separate landing page for my reportp  precodeltdiv datarolepage dataaddbackbtntruegt   ltdiv dataroleheader datathemeagt     lth1gtReport 1lth1gt     lta idbtnOpts dataicongear classuibtnright datareldialog datatransitionpopgtOptionsltagt ltdivgt codepre  pp  pThen I have one last page for my options dialogp  precodeltdiv iddlgOpts datarolepage datathemeagt  ltdiv datarolecontentgt      lth2gtPlease select the report optionslth2gt      ltdiv datarolefieldcontaingt         ltlabel forstartDategtStart Dateltlabelgt         ltinput typedate idstartDate dataroledatebox dataoptionsmode datebox gt     ltdivgt      ltdiv datarolefieldcontaingt         ltlabel forendDategtEnd Dateltlabelgt         ltinput typedate idendDate dataroledatebox dataoptionsmode calbox gt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classuigridagt         ltdiv classuiblockagtlta href dataiconback datarolebutton datarelbackgtCancelltagtltdivgt         ltdiv classuiblockbgtlta href dataiconcheck datarolebutton datarelbackgtOkltagtltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pMy goal is to load the report from the list, and when the report loads, show the options dialog.

Negative 33126 pIm using JQuery Address for a fairly simple ajax navigation, with an index.php which loads pages into a container .

But it doesnt work for a URL with a query string like test.phpd4ampc2. Instead it just loads this page into a blank window, not into the container div. Im pretty new to Address and Im sure this is quite simple, but I cant figure out why theres an inconsistency between the two examples, i.e. why it works for test.phpid3 but not for test.phpd4ampc2.p  pAny advice much appreciatedp

Negative 33126 pWell I am not familiar with threads in java, so I am dealing with this problem I have a singleton object who contains some objects let say sessions and each object has a duration time, so that means that after a some time one object is considered expired so it needs to be removed from a pool  List in singleton singleton. To do this I decided to have a thread that checks every 5 minutes or 10 minutes or whatever and clean up all session in the singleton class. How can I implement such a functionality avoiding any possible deadlock and or time consuming blocks. Thank you in advance. p
Negative 33126 pIm building a web app where users can build custom web pages that pull content from other web pages. I know of a few options for doing this, and Im not sure which is best, and if there are better solutions out there. Right now, I couldp  ul liUse iframes, which will sort of accomplish what I want, but will force the client to download and render all the web content, which seems slow. Ive heard a lot of people say iframes are passe and should not be used, etc.li liUse a library like wkhtmltopdf, which will render the html on the server side and generate a pdf image of it. This would work nicely, but the result is just an image, so text wont be selectable, links wont be clickable, etc. Also, Ive heard that you can get in legal trouble for hosting other peoples web content on your site without permission.li liUse something like phpquery to literally scrape content off of other sites.

Negative 33126 pDuring development, I like the idea of frameworks like Entity Framework 4.3 Migrations although I need it to work with sql scripts instead of Migration classes keeping all developer databases uptodate. Someone does an update to get the latest source, they try to run the application and get an error that they need to update their database to the latest migration or have the migration happen automatically. Migration files are timestamped so devs dont have to worry about naming two files the same or the sequence the files need to be executed in.p  pWhen I get ready to build a WebDeploy deployment package, I want the package to contain the scripts required to move the production database to the latest db version. So somehow, MSBuild or WebDeploy need to make a decision about which scripts must be packaged. For deployment I dont want the application to try to update itself like what EF offers. I want to either hand the package to the IT department or do an autodeploy through a deployment server.p  pSome of my questions arep  ol lipCan EF 4.3 work with sql scripts instead of DBMigration classes for my development needs Im already using it for my ORM so it would be nice if it couldpli lipDoes MSBuild or WebDeploy understand the concept of database migrations e.g. does it recognize the EF. 4.3 migrationHistory table or do I have to make sure to give it just the scripts it needs to run that will bring my prod db to the latest migration Manually deciding which scripts should be pakaged is not something I want to do so is there a MS WebDeploy extension that understands migrationspli lipAre my concerns and ideas valid Im just researching this stuff so I dont really know.pli ol

Negative 33126 pI wanted someone to resolve my confusion on this topic. It may sound simple, but am really confused.p  pIn producerconsumer problem, I used 4semaphore solution. I used a different lock for each of the critical sections.  Say,p  precodePseudo code of producer     waitslot  counting sem        waitmutex1  binary sem          rear lt rear  1          buffer[rear] lt item        signal mutex1     signalitems codepre  pWhere I use, mutex2 as a second Mutex for my consumer, as mutex1 in producer.p  pNow, my question is. If my producer and consumer is not using a buffer rear and front but using a stack, where only they can manipulate [top]. Do I need to use one mutex or two different locks as in my 4semaphore, in order to ensure mutual exclusion.p  precode Pseudo code of consumer with stack          wait message             wait mutex               getspace lt stack[top]               top  1             signal mutex           signal slot codepre  pPersonally, I think I need one lock for both procedures, so I make sure none of the producer and consumer access the top concurrently. But am not sure about that. Thank you.p

Negative 33126 pI am trying to convert an RGB frame, which is taken from OpenGL glReadPixels, to a YUV frame, and write the YUV frame to a file .yuv. Later on I would like to write it to a namedpipe as an input for FFMPEG, but as for now I just want to write it to a file and view the image result using a YUV Image Viewer. So just disregard the writing to pipe for now. p  pAfter running my code, I encountered the following errors  p  ol lipThe number of frames shown in the YUV Image Viewer software is always 13 of the number of frames I declared in my program. When I declare fps as 10, I could only view 3 frames. When I declared fps as 30, I could only view 10 frames. However when I view the file in Text Editor, I could see that I have the correct amount of word FRAME printed in the file. This is the example output that I got a hrefhttpwww.bobdanani.netimage.yuv relnofollowhttpwww.bobdanani.netimage.yuvapli lipI could not see the correct image, but just some distorted green, blue, yellow, and black pixels.pli ol  pI read about YUV format from a hrefhttpwiki.multimedia.cxindex.phptitleYUV4MPEG2 relnofollowhttpwiki.multimedia.cxindex.phptitleYUV4MPEG2a and a hrefhttpwww.fourcc.orgfccyvrgb.phpmikesanswer relnofollowhttpwww.fourcc.orgfccyvrgb.phpmikesanswera and a hrefhttpkylecordes.com2007pipeffmpeg relnofollowhttpkylecordes.com2007pipeffmpegap  pHere is what I have tried so far.

Can anyone tell me what is wrong in my approach My guess is that one of the issues is with the outstream.write call, because I converted the unsigned char data to char data that it may lose data precision. But if I dont cast it to char I will get a compile error. However this doesnt explain why the output frames are corrupted only account to 13 of the number of total frames. p

Negative 33126 pIm a little confused at the memory use of my WCF service. Brief overview, my wcf service is an odata providor that allows my ipad application to talk to our sql server database.p  pThe problem is that when a client ipad device using objective c odata library calls for a simple set of data say get all customers from the database the memory of the w3wp process goes up by a few mbs, and never really comes back down. Being the fact that all the client wants to do is one off calls retrieve a data set, update a data set, delete a data set than once it has finished its call the memory it used to do the action should be relinquished. This is not the case at all I gather there is some caching happening or maybe the calling instance is not being disposed.p  pCan anybody steer me in the right direction so the w3wp is lean and blows the memory away after the call has completed.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 33126 pIve got a situation where an application uses a plugin model to load assemblies at runtime.  Most of these assemblies have a further dependency on a common assembly which is modified over time.p  pFor example, Plugin A depends on Version 1 of Common and Plugin B depends on Version 2 of Common.p  pThe plugins are self contained and the common assemblies are strongly named, so in a purely managed environment the different Common assemblies get loaded and theres no danger of an accidental cast between types from the different Common versions and everything works fine.p  pWhen loading from a mixedmode assembly, which is a requirement, we are in a situation where the first loaded assembly wins.  So in the example, Plugin B would attempt to load against Common v1 that in our case throws a TypeLoadException because of some missing types in the old version of the assembly.p  pHow can we force the CCLI environment to honor the verisoning of the reference in the pluginsp  pWeve triedp  ol lipFU compiler option against the appropriate versionspli lipusing against the appropriate versionspli lipSpecific Version reference in the .NET reference dialog using the stronglynamed components.pli ol  pNone of these have been effective in getting the V2 assembly to be referenced.p  pUpdate Heres a bit more detail about the system, it is sensitive so Ill stick with the AB language above.p  pCommonAssembly.dll v1 and v2 C strongnamedp  pPluginA CCLI compiled with clr,  CommonAssembly v1 referenced with FU compiler optionp  pPluginB CCLI compiled with clr,  CommonAssembly v2 referenced with FU compiler optionp  pMain Application  Unmanaged  loads PluginA and PluginB at runtime with no direct references.p  pThe unmanaged application loads PluginA, which loads CommonAssembly v1.  The application then tries to load PluginB which requires CommonAssembly v2.  The CLR tries to use the v1 instead and there is a TypeLoadException.p

Negative 33126 pHi Im fairly new to formulas and excel but this is one of the problems I have encountered.p  pI have been using 2 conditional formatting formulas as followsp  ol lipcodeINDIRECTIampROWDelcodepli lipcodeINDIRECTIampROWSumcodepli ol  pWhere the first formula simply highlights the row grey if del is in the I column of that row, is there also a way of making it change say the K column to 0 if column H in that row is 0p  pAnd for the second formula which also highlights the row another color based on sum input in the given column of that row, is it also possible to change K column of that row to match the value of H column of the given row.p  pI know they would be similar but I needed to make it so formula one would only zero the K column in the given row if I column had del and H column of the row had Zero.p  pAnd for the second formula the values would only change in column k of the given row if sum was in the I column. Anything else needs to stay unformatted unless these changes are implemented.p  pI am unable to add a formula the the cells in question as these are overwritten with an button clicked event which inputs data into this field.p  pany information is appreciated, formula or VBA.p

Negative 33126 pIm moving my App to Storyboards and, so far, so good.p  pHowever, Ive found something that I dont really understand and worries me. I would appreciate if someone can provide some insight on this.p  pMy app uses a normal Navigation Controller. For moving forward to new View Controllers, Im using custom segues no problems there. However, theres a point in the App where I want to move back to the beginning of the Navigation Stack. I have also configured that navigation using a custom segue, for that, I created the segue in Interface Builder by dragging the last view controller to the first one that already looks weird to me, and Ive implemented the custom segue perform method in the following wayp  precodevoidperform      UIViewController src  UIViewController self.sourceViewController     UIViewController dest  UIViewController self.destinationViewController      [src.navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimatedNO]      Custom animation code here  codepre  p... It works great. However, I dont understand why it works. In my mind, the custom segue should be instantiating a new instance of my first view controller and assign it as dest, but it looks like the segue is smart enough to realize I want to navigate to a previous, existent, instance of a View Controller and, instead of creating a new instance, it assigns to dest the existing one.p  pDoes anybody know if using segues in this way is ok Is it possible that it works by chance but might stop working in the future Am I wasting memory in anyway as the segue is instantiating a View Controller Im not going to usep  pThanks a lot in advancep

Negative 33126 pI am trying to convert a slightly messy svn repository to git. I tried reading some guides and other SO questions, but get a little lost as to whats the best way to follow.p  pThe SVN repository has a toplevel folder structure with folders, something likep  precode  client   server   website   misc codepre  pMost of those folders have the standard svn structure i.e. codetrunkcode, codebranchescode and codetagscode. Some are just flat folders however.p  precode  client      trunk      branches      tags   server      trunk      branches      tags   website   misc codepre  pThe branches and tags might have the same name between different folders. For example, both client and server folders might have a branch called code1.0code.p  pI managed to convert individual folders using a hrefhttpsgithub.comnirvdrumsvn2git relnofollowsvn2gita, and it seems to get the history, as well as branches fine. I can manage to create an individual git repository for each folder. However, Id like to keep everything in emone repositoryem eventually.p  pWhats the best way to merge those folders now git repositories into one, whilst maintaining the branches, tags and history of each folder Using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1426163this approacha, I seem to lose both the commit history and the branches from the mergedfrom repository... Or perhaps Im just missing some important steps or doing something wrongp  pOtherwise, maybe using codesvn2gitcode on each folder separately is not the best approach to migrate from svn to gitp

Negative 33126 pI have relatively complex ui appearing in a popover complex enough that doing all the layout and relationships from code would be a pain, but the button that calls it is created and placed into the parent view which exists in the storyboard from code.p  pIve tried making a popover segue from the parent views viewcontroller object to the popover content vc, then triggering this with performSegueWithIdentifier. This almost works, but I cant figure out how to set the popOvers Anchor from code so it appears at the wrong place squished at the bottom of the screen.p  pIs there a way to set the popOver segues Anchor dynamically or Can i create a UIPopOverController object and get the view ive put together in the storyboard into it or Is there some other obvious way to do this that Im not seeingp  pplease be gentle, Im new here.p  piPad iOS5.1 XCode4.3.2p
Negative 33126 pIm working on a messaging app and I have a dilemma about how to send data from server to client.p  pIm using a centralized server design, where clients uses codeNSURLConnectioncode to send messages to the server, the server doesnt keep and manage open sockets and cant send a message for one of the clients. So clients use a timer and query the server every 2 seconds to see if new data is waiting for them.p  pThe problem with this approach is that polling the server every 2 second seem to kill the battery very fast, so I thought maybe instead of clients polling the server, to stronguse APNSstrong so when the server has some strongnew informationstrong  for the client, the server will send a strongpush notificationstrong emem  to the client, then the client will fetch the data from the server.p  pstrong use APNSstrong  if client allows it, client can of course disable this option. So I will check if push allowed every time the app enter foreground and if not Ill return to the polling approach.p  p  strongNew informationstrong can be anything from text messages to server admin messages. and there are a lot of admin messages...br For example, in my app users can see their friends status onlineoffline, so if user1 and user2 are friends, and user2 just change his status from online to offline, then server needs to send this new info admin message  user2offline to user1.p  pemstrongemstrong  strongThe push notificationsstrong server sends are empty with no datasound, its just a trigger for the client to fetch the new info, so if a push was sent to the client and the client app was close, he will not notice anything. if the app is running, then it will fetched the new info from serverp  pstrongWill this approach work with a massive messaging app requiring massive push notification usesstrongp  pTo be clearer my main concerns arebr 1. Is APNS reliable enough  that I can use it as my core servertoclient messaging mechanismbr 2. Will apple approve potentially thousands or hundreds of thousands push notifications a day from my serverp

Negative 33126 pI have a bash file lets call it bashfile which contains a number of environment variable assignments e.g. codeTOOLSDIRopttoolscode as well as bash code which sources another file e.g. codesource optotherfilecode and constructs environment variables from the environment variables sourced from otherfile e.g. codeNEWENVVARFILEPATHFILENAMEcode where FILEPATH and FILENAME are assigned in otherfile.p  pI have a Java application which requires visibility of these environment variables, but using the standard codeSystem.getenvcode doesnt pick up these environment variables since the bash file hasnt been sourced in Javas shell yet. If I use Javas codeRuntime.execsource bashfilecode, then the environment variables are only present in Javas child shell, even if bashs codeexportcode command is used.p  pIf I were in pure bash, Id simply perform my codesource bashfilecode and Id have access to all the environment variables assigned in bashfile, but its not that simple in Java.p  pI have thought of a few options already, none of which seem particularily elegantp  ol lipIn the same process with the codesource bashfilecode command, add the current codeenvcode to the .bashprofile so that it will be available for the all future runtime exec calls, such as System.getenv.p  pstrongProblemstrong Im not 100 sure that the getenv will even pick up on env vars added to the bashprofile during runtime, and having all of these variables exported globally isnt nice at all.pli lipAgain in the same process as codesourcebashfilecode, save current codeenvcode to a text file, and manually parse with Java.p  pstrongProblemstrong This would get the job done, but its nowhere near as nice and elegant as the Map returned by codeSystem.getenvcode.

Negative 33126 pI have a question regarding static variables, or some other way to do so.p  pI have a master class, PatternMatcher. I have several derived units from that, depending on what matcher is used. Now each subclass needs to store a vector of floats, but within each class it is constant. The data for that vector is read during initialization, and can be up to 1GB in size smallest I have is 1MB, biggest is 1GB.  Currently when I have for example two instances of MatcherA, it would allocate twice the memory. I do not know in advance which matchers are to be used per run it will be three matchers, and you can use the same matcher several times. I would prefer to not check during run time whether the wanted matcher is already initialized somewhere, since this would require additional code for every change I do.p  pCurrently I allocate the 3 matchers withp  precodePatternMatcher a  new PMMatcherA PatternMatcher b  new PMMatcherB PatternMatcher c  new PMMatcherC codepre  p, but since they are user selected, it could happen that A and C are the same for example. When I run a check via codetypeida.namecode, it would give me PatternMatcher as result, never matter what class I used to initiate with. PatternMatcher basically is purely a virtual class.p  pI always thought that static means that a variable is constant over different allocations, but when I define my vector as static, I would get a linker resolve error. In an earlier iteration, I had these vectors global, but would prefer them to be localized to their classes. p  pWhat are the keywords I need to use to have the vector from on initialization be available for the next initialization already A simple check if the vector size is greater than 0 would already be enough, but every object uses its own vector.p

It contains the pointer to this, plus the real paramaters I need for RealFnctnToCallp  precodeS package S.FooPtr  this S.intINeed  ... ...  recast S as void  codepre  pand then dop  precodepthreadcreateampthreads[id], NULL, ampFoocallerHelper, S  in callerHelper, depackage S and get everything I want.  codepre  pI am happy with my solution for this part, as long as there is a less sloppy way for my real question above. p

Negative 33126 pWe are getting some very weird behavior in Android.  Our network stack that talks to a REST server works fine in almost all situations, except when we do a GET shortly after doing a larger POST.  What appears to be happening is that the Output stream is not flushing, and ends up sending the last line that was in there when the new socket is opened.  Please note, each connection is a new object created, so this is unexpected behavior.  First, the error code that seems to point me to the output stream, these are from the server logs.p  blockquote   p10.1.8.195   [07Nov2012133628 0700] POST ioulender HTTP1.1 200 28  Android   10.1.8.195   [07Nov2012133636 0700] V2ymHFg03ehbqgZCaKO6jy 400 173  p blockquote  pThat attempt after should be a GET that then pulls the data from the server that includes the new entry added via the POST.

Negative 33126 pSo, Im trying to make the background to one of my apps look futuristic. I thought of an idea to make the screen look almost transparent yet have views over it. So, it would look something like this img srchttpc2499022.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.comwpcontentuploads200908windowphoneconcept.jpg altthis.p  pIm thinking that I can use the camera to capture the background of the phone without taking a picture, just having the real time view in the background and then, if possible, place a semitransparent slightly blurred ImageView over that. Finally, on top of that I can place the other views including the ImageButtons. p  pSo, my question is how would I go about doing this I have searched but havent found anything relevant. It must be possible its just how to do it I dont expect you to give me all the code as an answer, just if you have any ideas that can help or links or code that can point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated Thanksp

But its nagging at me that codeMyAsyncFunctioncode may always execute Operation1...Operation3 before releasing as it hits codeawait s.WriteAsynccode.pli lipWhat if I use codeThread.Sleepcode in the async function like thisp  precodeasync void DoStuff      Stream s...     ...     await s.WriteAsync....     Thread.Sleep10000     ....  codepre  pWill Thread.Sleep block the whole thread in which it is executed or just the async functionpli lipWhat if I use codesemaphore.Waitcode in one of the async functions and it will expect for the semaphore to be released by an other async function. Will this behave as it would with threads, or will it cause deadlockpli lipcodeawaitcode does not work outside of async functions. Whypli ol

Negative 33126 pCan any one help with following scenario I am working on a car inventory, such that,p  p1 An end product is a car, but pricing differs as per city due to road taxes etc.. User is expected to select a city and resulting car list should display  prices depending on location. Similarly a product details view should display price in selected location.p  pMy initial approach was to have Cities as primary categories. Create a product called Car A and map it to all cities since car A  could be available in multiple cities. To take care of city wise pricing variation   I can create multiple variants under Car A as per cities e.g. Product Car A can have product variants Car A  City 1, Car A  City 2 and so on.  However, if I am not wrong a variant cant be mapped directly to a category. p  p2 Product details view shows prices of ALL variants. Is there a way I can show price of only relevant variant i.e. If user clicks on category City A and then navigates to a product details view, I would want to show price for variant Car A City A. I understand no such 1to1 one relationship exists between category and product variant, so any suggestions are most welcome.p  p3 I want to display 2 prices i.e. Exshowroom and Monthly lease. So I am planning to replicate the price entity. I want to know if its possible to enable functionality of price filter to lease filter i.e. I need to have two price filters Exshowroom and Monthly leasep  p4 Lastly, has any one successfully customized the default spec filters to checkboxes or dropdowns.  I tried noptemplates Ajax Filters. Its a nice plugin. However I need a lot of customization like having two sets of price filters exshowroom amp lease.p  pstrongI fully understand that above will need lot of customization and I am open for it. However, any suggestions or prior experiences might get me into right directionstrongp

Negative 33126 pI am being passed a binary AST representing a math formula. Each internal node is an operator and leaf nodes are the operands.  I need to walk the tree and output the formula in infix notation.  This is pretty easy to do by walking the tree with a recursive algorithm such as the codePrintcode method shows below.  The problem with the codePrintcode method is that the order of operations is lost when converting to infix because no parentheses are generated.p  pI wrote the codePrintWithParenscode method which outputs a correct infix formula, however it adds extraneous parentheses.  You can see in three of the four cases of my main method it adds parenthesis when none are necessary.p  pI have been racking my brain trying to figure out what the correct algorithm for codePrintWithMinimalParenscode should be.  Im sure there must be an algorithm that can output only parentheses when necessary to group terms, however I have been unable to implement it correctly.  I think I must need to look at the precedence of the operators in the tree below the current node, but the algorithm I have there now doest work see the last 2 cases in my main method.  No parentheses are needed, but my logic adds them.p  precodepublic class Test   static abstract class Node       Node left     Node right     String text      abstract void Print     abstract void PrintWithParens     abstract void PrintWithMinimalParens      int precedence              return 0        enum Operator       PLUS1,,      MINUS1, ,      MULTIPLY2, ,      DIVIDE2, ,      POW3,             private final int precedence     private final String text      private Operatorint precedence, String text              this.precedence  precedence         this.text  text           Override     public String toString          return text           public int getPrecedence          return precedence        static class OperatorNode extends Node       private final Operator op      OperatorNodeOperator op              this.op  op           Override     void Print          left.Print         System.out.printop         right.Print           Override     void PrintWithParens          System.out.print         left.PrintWithParens         System.out.printop         right.PrintWithParens         System.out.print           Override     void PrintWithMinimalParens           boolean needParens                   left.precedence  0 ampamp left.precedence lt this.op.precedence                                    right.precedence  0 ampamp right.precedence lt this.op.precedence          ifneedParens             System.out.print          left.PrintWithMinimalParens         System.out.printop         right.PrintWithMinimalParens          ifneedParens             System.out.print            Override     int precedence          return op.getPrecedence         static class TextNode extends Node       TextNodeString text              this.text  text           Override     void Print          System.out.printtext           Override     void PrintWithParens          System.out.printtext           Override     void PrintWithMinimalParens          System.out.printtext         private static void printExpressionsNode rootNode       System.out.printPrint       rootNode.Print     System.out.println     System.out.printPrintWithParens       rootNode.PrintWithParens     System.out.println     System.out.printPrintWithMinimalParens       rootNode.PrintWithMinimalParens     System.out.println     System.out.println    public static void mainString[] args       System.out.printlnDesired  1234     Node rootNode  new OperatorNodeOperator.PLUS     rootNode.left  new TextNode1     rootNode.right  new OperatorNodeOperator.PLUS     rootNode.right.left  new TextNode2     rootNode.right.right  new OperatorNodeOperator.PLUS     rootNode.right.right.left  new TextNode3     rootNode.right.right.right  new TextNode4      printExpressionsrootNode      System.out.printlnDesired 1234     rootNode  new OperatorNodeOperator.PLUS     rootNode.left  new TextNode1     rootNode.right  new OperatorNodeOperator.PLUS     rootNode.right.left  new OperatorNodeOperator.MULTIPLY     rootNode.right.left.left  new TextNode2     rootNode.right.left.right  new TextNode3     rootNode.right.right  new TextNode4      printExpressionsrootNode      System.out.printlnDesired 1234     rootNode  new OperatorNodeOperator.PLUS     rootNode.left  new TextNode1     rootNode.right  new OperatorNodeOperator.MULTIPLY     rootNode.right.left  new TextNode2     rootNode.right.right  new OperatorNodeOperator.PLUS     rootNode.right.right.left  new TextNode3     rootNode.right.right.right  new TextNode4      printExpressionsrootNode      System.out.printlnDesired 12834     rootNode  new OperatorNodeOperator.PLUS     rootNode.left  new TextNode1     rootNode.right  new OperatorNodeOperator.MULTIPLY     rootNode.right.left  new OperatorNodeOperator.POW     rootNode.right.left.left  new TextNode2     rootNode.right.left.right  new TextNode8     rootNode.right.right  new OperatorNodeOperator.PLUS     rootNode.right.right.left  new TextNode3     rootNode.right.right.right  new TextNode4      printExpressionsrootNode       codepre  pOutputp  precodeDesired  1234 Print  1234 PrintWithParens  1234 PrintWithMinimalParens  1234  Desired 1234 Print  1234 PrintWithParens  1234 PrintWithMinimalParens  1234  Desired 1234 Print  1234 PrintWithParens  1234 PrintWithMinimalParens  1234  Desired 12834 Print  12834 PrintWithParens  12834 PrintWithMinimalParens  12834 codepre  pstrongIs is possible to implement the codePrintWithMinimalParenscode that I want  Does the fact that order is implicit in the tree make doing what I want impossiblestrongp

Negative 33126 pI have a table that has about 1500 students and their teacher. There are 152 teachers. The collective students a teacher has is their caseload.

Negative 33126 pI am learning how to use the Telerik test environment.  I created a test that runs through my program.  One of the steps is to create a repository, into which I will upload data. I would like to run this test numerous times as a load test, so the name needs to be dynamic. I would like to create a name such as RepositoryDateTime, since no matter how many times I use it, uniqueness is guaranteed.  p  pI created a code step right before the text box insertion step. I would like to generate a string, and then use it in the next step so that the repository is created with a unique name. p  pCode generated is this is in the steps within the telerik applicationp  precode     [WebTestCodedStep]  New Coded Step codepre  pThen, within this step, I can hard code stuff p  precode    [CodedStepNew Coded Step]             public void WebTestCodedStep                            codepre  pI want to use something like this codestring currentTime  DateTime.Now.ToStringHHmmsscode p  pand then use the saveNow contained data as an ending to a string to make it unique, but it must be done within the following stepp  precodeType MosheMaster Repository Test01 into Item0Textboxchanged      TypedText               MosheMaster Repository Test01 codepre  pSo that the red name will be substituted by a variable carrying the new string which I creatred. The TypedText box is the value being typed automatically, and I would like to change it with the generated value from the previous step.

The location where I can put it as input is in the top right statechart with all current data being used for that particular step. bindings is set to collection at the moment. When I try to change it into a variable it tells me that the variable needs to be created it does not specify where.p

For the sake of simplicity, Im going to assume that nothing new will be written to the terminal until the user gives an answer to a threads output, so that new lines are only written after the user replies, etc. I have read up on waiting for user input on the terminal, and it seems that ncurses is the way to go for this.  p  pHowever, now I have read that ncurses is not threadsafe, and Im unsure how to proceed. I suppose I could wrap everything terminalrelated with mutexes, but before I do that Id like to know if theres a smarter and possibly more convenient way of going about this, maybe a solution with condition variables Im somewhat lost here, so any help is welcome.p

Negative 33126 pI am having trouble finding the most simple way to validate a JSON String against a given JSONschema String for reference, this is in Java, running in an Android app.  p  pIdeally, Id like to just pass in a JSON String and a JSONschema String, and it returns a boolean as to whether it passes the validation.  Through searching, I have found the following 2 promising libraries for accomplishing thisp  pa hrefhttpjsontools.berlios.dehttpjsontools.berlios.deap  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comfgejsonschemavalidatorhttpsgithub.comfgejsonschemavalidatorap  pHowever, the first one seems fairly outdated with poor support.  I implemented the library into my project, and even with their JavaDocs, I was unable to tell how to properly build a Validator object for validation.p  pSimilar story with the 2nd one, which seems to be uptodate with good test code.  However, for what I want to do, which is very simple, it seems to be a bit daunting and confusing as to how to specifically accomplish what I want even after looking at the a hrefhttpsgithub.comfgejsonschemavalidatordemoblobmastersrcmainjavacomgithubfgejsonschemaservletsValidateServlet.javaValidateServlet.javaa file.  p  pCurious if anyone has any other suggestions on a good way to accomplish this from what it seems, simple task that need, or if I perhaps need to stick with the 2nd option from above  Thanks in advancep

Negative 33126 pI have a large Maven project which has several modules in it. When I want to run a JUnit test from one module I run mvn DtestNameOfTest test in the directory that contains all the modules. When I run this command Maven goes through each module and tries to compile it though its already compiled, which involves copying a bunch of files and adds to the total time of the test. It seems that the test command for the Maven surefire plugin executes all the steps up to the test. I was wondering if there is a way to execute only the test step and not bother with all the attempted compilation and copying of files.p  pHere is some output from before the test startsp  precode[INFO]  [INFO]  buildhelpermavenplugin1.5addtestsource addtestsource  module1  [INFO] Test Source directory ltdirectory in module1 with some generated sourcesgt added.

Negative 33126 pSo i am working on this app, we have suppliers and each supplier has many scores and each score has details. there are two ways of entering scores for suppliers one way is via a form, the other is a excel upload. now we have some people who upload via spreadsheet that will update a single supplier and then upload the whole list which is creating duplicates for all her suppliers.p  pI wrote this sql statement. note what makes a score unique is 1. its ID and 2. the combination of the validfrom and validuntil dates.p  precodedef removeoldduplicates   removedup  DELETE s1 FROM smsdevelopment.scores s1, smsdevelopment.scores s2 WHERE s1.supplierid  s2.supplierid AND s1.validfrom  s2.validfrom AND s1.validuntil  s2.validuntil AND s1.id lt s2.id    ActiveRecordBase.connection.execute removedup end codepre  pBasically what this is supposed to do is takes the table and combines it with itself then looks for all scores where the suppliers are the same and where the validfrom and validuntil attributes are the same. then it looks for the one with the biggest ID number and deletes the rest. only thing is its not deleting them. i run the query in work bench and it says its working fine just not in the app. i run this query just after new data is imported any ideas on what could be causing thisp  pNOTE the reason i am basing it off the ID number and not the createdat attribute is because rails gives me the createdat attribute if i create the score within the field, the excel upload uses a sql insert and thus dont get that attribute, since the id is unique i figured the bigger the ID the newer the record  p

Two answers for the price of onestrongp  pIve got an Access 2007 database that uses tabbed documents. I need to run some VBA code every time a user selects the form called Reports, either via opening it or clicking on its tab if its already open.p  pI could achieve much the same thing by closing it each time its used and running the code on an OnLoad event, but ideally Id like to keep it open so that users can keep the settings of the various drop down boxes, radio boxes etc that theyve already set on Reports.p  pI was hoping for an event that could run code on tab reselection, but neither of my guesses OnCurrent and GotFocus seem to work OnCurrent works only when the form is opened, like OnLoad would.p  pAny ideas greatly appreciated  cant find what Im looking for on Google, though I suspect thats because I dont know exactly what Im looking for.p

Negative 33126 pI am using version R2007a.p  pFirst for a little background I am creating a tool that accumulates a scatter plot from data acquired in real time.  When the number of points gets large enough, the graphics refresh cant keep up with the incoming data, so I am using codepainterscode with codeEraseModecode set to codenonecode and simply doing a codesetobj,xdata,...,ydata,...code to update the plot point position. This works very nicely.p  pIncidentally, I discovered a nice trick by turning on double buffering, MATLAB always has a copy of the image in memory, so points accumulate in the image even when the window is hidden or minimizedp  pNow I would like to capture each image to create a movie.  I have seen a variety of solutions using codegetframecode, codeaddframecode, and the undocumented codehardcopycode.  These all redraw the figure and the old points are lost, but this is actually something I can work around in postprocessing.  My issue is that these functions are too slow for the data acquisition rate.  With tictoc, I findp  precodetic, getframeh toc  0.13 sec tic, addframeh toc  0.15 sec tic, hardcopyh,Dpainters,r0 toc  0.07 sec codepre  pI see that codehardcopycode does something different with coderenderercode set to codepainterscode, but even if I could find out how to make of use of its output, its still too slow.p  pBut with double buffering on, the image is already sitting in the backing store  back buffer.  Making a copy of that would be quite fast.  Can any hackers out there figure out how to get a pointer to the backing store and make a copy of itp  pThanksp

Negative 33126 pI have the following codep  precodevar doneFileconvertToMOSTEMcurFile.file,curFile.color,curFile.importance console.logdoneFile console.logdoneFile debugger filesOS.adddoneFile debugger codepre  pcodeconvertToMOSTEMcode returns a custom object. The codeconsole.logcode logs the custom object created by codeconvertToMOSTEMcode to the console, but at the debugger statement directly after the console.log logs it as a different object. I do not wish to elaborate more about the contents of codeconvertToMOSTEMcode, and am instead asking for situations where this can happen. I can say, however, that codeconvertToMOSTEMcode creates a custom object with a custom constructor, and then it modifies some of the properties of that custom object, then returns the modified object. The console.log logs the correct version of the object, but the object that I get in the debugger statement is like a clean version of the custom object without the extra modifications applied by the codeconvertToMOSTEMcode function. I am not sure if that is very clear, if you have any questions please ask me questions in the comments.p
Negative 33126 pI have a domain specific language that I would like to interact with C by adding new keywords or some keywordlike syntax. Using attributes would be insufficient I cant use them in method bodies, and shoehorning it into valid C notation that gets compiled into something else would be ugly and ruin the analogy with the DSL and the translation from DSLlike notation to C is nontrivial, so just writing the C each time is out of the question. p  pI already have a way to parse the .cs file and transform it into legitimate, nontrivial, C code which can be compiled.p  pThe problem is, even through I can do all the work of defining the DSL, parsing it, and translating it into valid C, Visual Studio wont let me use notation it doesnt understand it just adds red squiggles, emits an error cannot resolve symbol, and then often fails to properly parse things after it.p  pIs there a way to to force visual studio to ignore specific strings in its analysis Ive looked at visual studio plugins but it looks like, although I can do syntax highlighting and other stuff, I cant force it to ignore something it doesnt know how to parse unless Im missing some way to do that in the extension API, which is certainly possible.p  pIve skimmed through the Roslyn stuff and dont see offhand a way to do this there, either. Again, may be missing something, it doesnt seem to have great documentation.p

So then I added strongsessionfalsestrong in my jsp page header but when I call my jsp I still receive a JSESSIONID and I think I dont want that.p  pBecause if the jsessionid from the http page is different than the one from https I get logged out.p  pSo how do I prevent JSP from making a JSESSIONIDp  pps I am using tomcat 6.p
Negative 33126 pIs it possible to fetch an already cached entity in Doctrine2 in its pure formp  pWhenever I try to fetch it using codefindcode or event using the QueryBuilder, it results in a Proxy class, which is impossible to properly store and then wakeup in a Session.p  pI am using the entity as an User identity, which I would like to persist in the Session, but it seems, that the adapter cant really wake up proxies.p  pAny ideasp  pIve tried codefindcode from the repository, the query builder and even coderefreshcode after the entity is fetched with no success.p  pOh, and as I know about the EAGER fetch method, Im not really sure its usable in this case and how, since there are no relations taking place, and the proxy actually comes from Doctrines cache, or so I believe.p

It works great if I only need to pull one photo at a time, but it would be nicer if I could just select all the photos and pull them over all at once.

Something like thisp  precodestrFileText  ReplacestrFileText, strLineRead, strNewLine codepre  pand then write that entire string to a new text file.p  pThe problem is, sometimes I might have a line where its entire text is NC, and then doing a findreplace on the entire file for NC changes more than just the one line.p  pSo is there a command in the FileSystemObject, while on a certain line, to be able to alter the file directly  Im thinking something like a writeline command.p
Negative 33126 pA week ago I got in a situation where I had to read a binary serialized object made by another application made by somebody else.  I only had the someSerializedData.bin file, so I tried to manually recreate the class definition for the unknown object and I was able to do so, because of the metadata in the serialized file. Oddly, I couldnt find any tool on google.p  pstrongQ1 Why is there no tool that recreates the class definition from a binary serialized filedatastrongp  pAnd it leads to my second questionp  pstrongQ2 Is there such case when its impossible to restore the class definition from the serialized data Assuming its no encrypted or obfuscated in any way, Im interested in cases involving the default .net Binaryserializer properties to disable type information and metadata includedstrongp

Negative 33126 pThis is more of a conceptual question than a technical one. My understanding of H.264 is that it relies on past and future frames in order to compress video data. Its trivial to take a fully compressed H.264 video file and stream it via RTP or any other protocol of your choice, however, how would this work with real time video In real time video you only have access to past and current frames and dont know the full length of the video, so how can the H.264 codec actually compress the video and prepare it to be an RTP payload Does it simply buffer and chunk the video into an arbitrarily sized smaller video and compress that The only way I can think of this working is to split the video into something like 1 second chunks, compress those as individual videos, and make them the RTP payload. Is this how its done or is there more magic happening than I suspectp

Negative 33126 pI am trying to use a library that uses JNI. In the sample app that the providers of the library have provided, the whole thing works flawlessly, so I know everything is done right in the c code. I know Im doing somehting wrong in the process of importing the library. This is ALL Ive done brcopy the .so file into my libs folder its called libjniRTSP.so brcopy the the jniRTSP.java summarized below into my projectp  precodepublic class jniRTSP   private volatile static jniRTSP libRTSP  null  public static jniRTSP getInstance      ifnull  libRTSP          synchronizedjniRTSP.class              ifnull  libRTSP                  libRTSP  new jniRTSP                 libRTSP.InitProductList                   DEBUG                 libRTSP.SetDebugView1                                return libRTSP   static      try          System.loadLibraryjniRTSP      catch Exception e          e.printStackTrace       public native int       GetBrandEnableRecorder public native int       GetBrandEnableLocal public native int       GetBrandEnableRemote ... codepre  pthen in my onCreate I try to call one of the methodsp  precodejniRTSP.getInstance.Init..... codepre  pbut I get the error UnsatisfiedLinkError Native method not found com.myuniquepackage.jniRTSP.InitProductListIp  pAgain this library works in the sample project. Is there something I need to do in my properties to let the linker know where to find the definition of these methodsp  pUPDATE FIX instead of just copying the jniRTSP java file, I copied the whole package that contained it, keeping the same package name. Im not sure if this fixed it because the package name was the issue, or if because it needed one of the other java files that were in that package. Although Im pretty sure if it was a missing file, it would complain at compile time. p

It works as expected. However, if I run a command codePyro4.naming.locateNScode from another thread when the name server is running, then the next time I call nameServer.stopNS, the program freezes. Anyone has an idea why And what would be the best at least a better way to write such a NameServer wrapper.p

Negative 33126 pI just started learning Node.js and as I was learning about the codefs.watchFilecode method, I was wondering if a chat website could be efficiently built with it and codefs.writeFilecode, against for example Socket.IO which is stable, but I believe not 100 stable several fallbacks, including flash.p  pUsing codefs.watchFilecode could perhaps also be used to keep histories of the chats quite simply as JSON would be used on the spot.p  pThe chat files could be formatted in JSON in such a way that only the last chatters message is brought up to the DOM or whatever to make it efficient to fetch messages when the file gets updated.p  pI havent tried it yet as I still need to learn more about Node, and even more to be able to compare it with Socket.IO, but whats your opinion about it Could it be an efficientstable way of doing chatsp

Is there an equivalent of that BaseEffect in Androidp  pIm asking this because the two of us have been assigned this project by a professor, who told us that its not important for this project to develop custom shaders, so Im guessing there is a compilation of basical shaders that I can browse.

Negative 33126 pIve wasted now almost a day trying to solve this small but annoying issue Im facing with a project Im working on, so I thought to give stackoverflow a try. After all, Ive found so often solutions to my problems in the existing threads, but this time I didnt seem to find anything applicable to my present problem.p  pIve got a pretty simple layout going on where the main content is a feed which will change based on the choices the user makes on the menu. The feed content is data represented in tabular form which scales quite flexibly with the container up to a point. Because the menu needs to be accessed often, it has been positioned as a fixed box on the left relative to the left edge of the body to keep it always in sight while scrolling down the feed.p  pStripped to its bare bones, the setup look like thisp  precodeltbodygt ltdiv idmenuwrappergt menuhtml ltdivgt ltdiv idcontentwrappergt feedcontent ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pNow, Ive got a media query going on to switch the layout so that the menu changes from portrait to landscape and goes to float on the top of the viewport instead of left once the viewport width is less than 600 px, and this works like a charm, but my problem is in getting the default layout to behave in a desired way while the window width is something between 940px the full width and 600 px.p  pThe desired way is to get the feed div to resize dynamically with the window and not to introduce horizontal scrollbars which make the feed slide under the menu with fixed position. Ive figured out that likely this is an issue with how Im positioning the content div, but the answer eludes me.p  pIf I try to position the content div statically with codemarginleft 240pxcode or relatively with a left translation codeposition relative left 240pxcode I get the same result It resizes, but not in desired way. Once I resize the window, I first get a horizontal scrollbar and only once the size of the left indent has been first swallowed under the right edge of the browser window does the content div begin to scale with the window. For the relative approach I understand that this is because the placeholder of the div still stays where it would statically be and is resized only when the placeholder would be resized, but I was rather surprised that using a marginleft had the same results.p  pIf I try to position it with codefloat rightcode, it follows obediently the approaching right edge of the browser window, but instead of resizing, it slides under the menu and begins only resizing once it reaches the left edge of the body.p  pFinally, if I try to position it with codeposition absolute right 0code, it seems to assume the entire viewport as its containing object instead of body and fills the entire width of the screen. which I find strange since eveyrthing I know of the positioning model tells me that it should inherit the initial position from the body elementp  pThe positioning part of the CSS is below Ive omitted fonts, backgrounds, colors amp suchp  precodebody      maxwidth 900px     margin 0 auto     padding 0 20px 0 20px   divmenuwrapper      position fixed     top 120px     minwidth 180px     minheight 180px     padding 10px   divcontentwrapper      margintop 120px     maxwidth 600px     minwidth 300px     width 100      SOME POSITIONING HERE   codepre  pOh, and everything that comes inside the contentwrapper another div with some decorations which in turn holds the table with the actual content is statically placed and has either no width definition or width 100p  pI would really appreciate any help on this one. I cant believe that I would have to resort to html tables and risk simplicity or to javascript and risk compatibility to make something seemingly so simple work Thanks in advancep

Negative 33126 pI have come across a strange performance regression from Linux kernel 3.11 to 3.12 on x8664 systems. Running a hrefhttpmarkjstock.orgpagesradbench.htmlMark Stocks Radiance benchmarka on Fedora 20, 3.12 is noticeably slower. Nothing else is changed  identical binary, identical glibc  I just boot a different kernel version, and the performance changes. The timed program, rpict, is 100 CPU bound userlevel code.p  pBefore I report this as a bug, Id like to find the cause for this behavior. I dont know a lot about the Linux kernel, and the change log from 3.11 to 3.12 does not give me any clue.p  pI observed this on two systems, an Intel Haswell i74771 and an AMD Richland A86600K. On the Haswell system user time went from 895 sec with 3.11 to 962 with 3.12. On the Richland, from 1764 to 1844. These times are repeatable to within a few seconds.p  pI did some profiling with perf, and found that IPC went down in the same proportion as the slowdown. On the Haswell system, this seems to be caused by more missed branches, but why should the prediction rate go down Radiance does use the random number generator  could better randomness cause the missed branches But apart from OMAP4 support, the RNG does not have to seem changed in 3.12.p  pOn the AMD system, perf just points to more idle backend cycles, but the cause is not clear.p  pHaswell systemp  precode3.11.10  895s user, 3.74 branchmisses, 1.65 insns per cycle 3.12.6   962s user, 4.22 branchmisses, 1.52 insns per cycle codepre  pRichland systemp  precode3.11.10  1764s user, 8.23 branchmisses, 0.75 insns per cycle 3.12.6   1844s user, 8.26 branchmisses, 0.72 insns per cycle codepre  pI also looked at a diff from the dmesg output of both kernels, but did not see anything that might have caused such a slowdown of a CPUbound program.p  pI tried switching the cpufreq governor from the default emondemandem to empeformanceem but that did not have any effect.p  pThe executable was compiled using gcc 4.7.3 but not using AVX instructions. libm still seems to use some AVX e.g. codeieee754powfma4code but these functions are only 0.3 of total execution time.p  pAdditional infop  ul lia hrefhttpwww.chrbreitkopf.detmpkernelconfigdiff.txtDiff of kernel configsali lia hrefhttpwww.chrbreitkopf.detmpdmesgdiffhaswell.txtdiff of the dmesg outputsa on the Haswell system.li lia hrefhttpwww.chrbreitkopf.detmpmapsdiff.txtdiff of procpidmapsa  3.11 maps only one heap region 3.12 lots.li lia hrefhttpwww.chrbreitkopf.detmpperfstat.A8.txtperf stat outputa from the A86600K systemli lia hrefhttpwww.chrbreitkopf.detmpperfstat.A8.TLB.txtperf stats w TLB missesa dTLB stats look very differentli lia hrefhttpwww.chrbreitkopf.detmptime.A8.txtusrbintime v outputa from the A86600K systemli ul  pAny ideas apart from bisecting the kernel changesp

For simplicity, suppose they look like the followingp  precodeproducts id    codepre  pbrp  precodeproductprices id  pid  price  dateadded codepre  pWhat I need to do is get the most recently added price, along with the date that price was added. So, in other words, for each product, I need to get the most recent codepricecode and codedateaddedcode along with the product id, codepidcode, of course.p  pIf I only needed to get the most recent date and price for one product whose ID is known, then I can do it with thisp  precodeSELECT price, dateadded  FROM productprices WHERE pid  1 ORDER BY dateadded DESC LIMIT 1 codepre  pHowever, this type of query will not work when I need to get the most recent date and price for emallem of the products. p  pI believe the solution is to use the codeMAXcode aggregate function in conjunction with codeGROUP BYcode and a subquery, but I simply cannot get it to work.p  pHere is a test database on SQL Fiddle a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com2881cae3 relnofollowhttpsqlfiddle.com2881cae3ap  pI realize there are a lot of similar questions on here, but I have read many of them and havent been able to solve my problem, so I would appreciate direct help instead of just crying duplicate and linking to another post. Thank you.p  pEDIT SQL Fiddle seems to be down at the moment, so here is the database schema I had on therep  precodeCREATE TABLE products    id int autoincrement primary key,    name varchar20   INSERT INTO products    name  VALUES product 1, product 2   CREATE TABLE productprices    id int autoincrement primary key,    pid int,    price decimal10,2,   dateadded int   INSERT INTO productprices    pid,    price,    dateadded  VALUES 1, 1.99, 1000, 1, 2.99, 2000, 1, 3.99, 3000, 1, 4.99, 4000, 1, 5.99, 5000, 1, 6.99, 6000,   2, 1.99, 1000, 2, 2.99, 2000, 2, 3.99, 3000, 2, 4.99, 4000, 2, 5.99, 5000, 2, 6.99, 6000 codepre

Negative 33126 pI am working with a real time data analysis toolchain which is separated into two parts. The first part fetches the data to be analyzed, packs it into a UDP packet and sends it to another host. The second part, running on the aforementioned host, receives the UDP packets and performs analysis on the received packets. By real time I mean that the output of the analysis toolchain should appear live to a human user, thus latencies of up to 100 ms are acceptable.p  pI am looking into making a new data source available to the receiving part. The data that I am looking for are being transferred on an Ethercat bus, which I can sniff. Wiresharktshark have a dissector for Ethercat packets. With that said, its really simple to get at the data in a script running within Wiresharktshark. Since I have little control over the second part of the analysis, I cannot readily modify the second part to sniff Ethercat frames via pcap or somesuch.p  pIs it possible to send UDP packets from a script running in Wiresharktsharkp

Because mseconds and  days have up to 3 characters, a while loop is used to  continuously add 0s until they have 3.  Other values which  only need 2 leading 0s can get by on a single if check while this.msecs.length lt 3 this.msecs  0  this.msecs if this.secs.length lt 2 this.secs  0  this.secs if this.mins.length lt 2 this.mins  0  this.mins if this.hours.length lt 2 this.hours  0  this.hours while this.days.length lt 3 this.days  0  this.days   finally, display your values.  If you want to put your values  in a textField, you can pretty much just stop here and throw them  into your textField as desired.  This example, however will go a step  further and use images for numbers for each numerical value in the  countdown to the desired date.   So, for that, loop through all the movies in this counter clip using the  evaluateFrameFrom prototype method on each. A single check for a  parent variable is used to make sure the property found in a for  loop is a movieclip and is within the timeline of this counter clip.  TextFields and buttons would also be true here, but since the contents  within counter are strictly those numbers movieclips, we wont have to  be concerned with such complications.  The only movieclips in this counter  clip are the numbers movieclips with the frames of the imagery making up  the numbers of 09. forvar movie in this     if this[movie].parent  this this[movie].evaluateFrameFromthis     this function is a MovieClip.prototype meaning its available to be used by  all movieclips.  Its a sneaky function that saves a lot of work by using  name each numbers movieclip in the counter movieclip to determine which value  it needs to display based on the times derived from the previous   calculations of the onEnterFrame. What it does is seperates a movieclips  name into a variable word and a number.  The variable word will represent  the variable to look up a value for in the passed variableClip and the  number will be used to get a character from that value a string which  represents which number this movieclip should display. MovieClip.prototype.evaluateFrameFrom  functionvariableClip  split this name into an array of 2 values seperated by an underscore var nameArray  this.name.split  the first value represents what variable in variableClip counter clip  this movieclip is used to represent whether it be mins or hours etc. var numberSet  variableClip[nameArray[0]]  next a number representing which character in that first value this  movieclip should display.  this will be between 0 and 2 any one of  three values.  number is used to force it to be a number value. var characterint  parseIntnameArray[1]  a frame number can then be derived from the value of the numberset  variable based on the character defined by character.  number is  used to force it to a number value and 1 is added to offset the  frame value by one since 0 is at frame 1 and 1 at frame 2 etc. var frame  1  parseIntnumberSet.charAtcharacter  if the movieclip is not already at the frame, move it there if this.currentframe  frame this.gotoAndStopframe  codepre  pand it is not showing any error messages within the codes.p

The master plugin pulls in the chained plugin like sop  precode grailsmasters BuildConfig.groovy plugins      compile widget1.0.5  or whatever  codepre  pThis way, anytime a Grails app includes codegrailsmastercode as a dependency, both master and chained plugins get pulled in.p  pNow lets say that the chained codegrailswidgetcode plugin requires configuration. Lets say that if an app requires codegrailswidgetcode directly sans the master, then one must configure the plugin from inside the Grails apps codeConfig.groovycode like sop  precodegrails.plugin.widget.fizz1 grails.plugin.widget.buzzYES ... etc. codepre  pHeres what Id like to accomplish, if at all possiblep  ul liIf a Grails app just lists codegrailsmastercode as a dependency, then the master pulls in codegrailswidgetcode strongbut provides default valuesstrong for its codefizzcode and codebuzzcode properties.

Negative 33126 pI am new to front end development and I am really seeking for the solution.p  pBasically I have this input fields in the page and validated each of them using ajax.

Negative 33126 pI know that there are other errors for certain header files with the same message of No such file or directory, but my circumstances are a bit different as I will explain now.p  pI use the Code Blocks IDE and wanted to start using the UI Automation library. When I tried to include the headerp  precodeinclude UIAutomation.h codepre  pCode Blocks could not find the header. From there I looked around my computer and saw that the UIAutomation.h, UIAutomationCore.h... and the other UIAutomation headers were in an Include file in the Microsoft SDKs folder.... So I went to Settings  Compiler  Search directories and in there I added a new directory to the include folder where the UI Automation headers were p  pCProgram FilesMicrosoft SDKsWindowsv7.0AIncludep  pand Code Blocks found the headers. However... another error appearedp  precodefatal error sal.h No such file or directory codepre  pand I searched for the sal.h in the Include folder I had just written code for and there was no sal.h file. I understood everything up until here... I had to check if I had a sal.h folder somewhere else on my computer and I did, in a file somewhere in my Visual Studio 10 IDE folders just to let u guys know, I use code blocks cause I have been using it for a long time, and only downloaded VS10 recently to use spy. So then I thought ok... Ill do the same thing I did before again so that I can include those files too, so I go back into the Search directories section and add the directoryp  pCProgram FilesMicrosoft Visual Studio 10.0VCincludep  pbut from there a million different errors appeared, all refereeing to different issues. Can anyone tell me what I did wrong All I wanted to do was use the UI Automation headers so that I can start coding with the library, but that is proving to be a bit difficult...p

Negative 33126 pI have two processes named strongAstrong and strongBstrong two exefiles emA.exeem and emB.exeem both implemented in C. Process strongBstrong is called by process strongAstrong. In strongAstrong, an object is serialized to a binary file by using the ISerializable interface. This happens every few milliseconds. Process strongBstrong deserializes this object also every few milliseconds.p  pI am wondering whether I need a Semaphore when one process reads from a file, and the other writes. Is it possible that strongBstrong tries to read the binary file, while strongAstrong has not finished writingp

Im doing all the work via a self written ThreadPool, but if I use the asyncawait Pattern, the continuation always runs on a thread named Worker Thread. Im pretty sure thats a thread from the default ThreadPool which is also used to process HTTP requests. This leads to a starvation of these requests as all the threads of the default ThreadPool are busy continuing my background work.p

Negative 33126 pI have been searching the net for any references or tutorials for learning Django. Since Im going to learn it, it makes sense that I learn the newestreleases version 1.7. However, all the tutorials that I can find Tango with Django amp others, seem to be teaching previous versions1.5. I wanted to know p  p1 Are there any good quality guides available for the more recent versions br  2 Is there a considerable basic difference in the versions of django, that would render the older tutorials completely useless for the more recent versions p  pI understand that the documentation is really good. I did its tutorial. It was wonderful. I just wanted more exposure through other good  quality tutorials that pertain to the 1.7 version  before jumping into the documentations.p

Negative 33126 pFunctional tests, unlike unit tests, cannot often be naturally isolated as each test usually requires the state after the execution of the previous one.p  pFor example to test basic CRUD operations like entity deletion or updating it must first be created. While we can prevent code duplication by extracting the code of entity creation into a separate method, it is unclear how to deal with repetition of calling entity creation test or any other dependent tests. And as the number of tests grows these repeated calls significantly degrade time execution and readability.p  pAn intuitive solution would be to merge all these interdependent tests into a single one, but it makes harder to localize a bug.p  pThe information I have read so far was mostly about unit testing and I think it does not perfectly fit the needs for functionalacceptance and especially web browser testing.p  pTo be specific, currently I am using JUnit tests interacting with the webapp with inmemory database via Selenium WebDriver API. p  pWhat best practicals some would recommend for this problemp

Negative 33126 pIve been at my wits end for a few days now with this issue and I cant seem to find the problem.p  pOverviewp  ul liIm building a Symfony2 website using FOSUserBundle as the user manager, and Propel as the database provider.li liIve successfully overridden the login template and I can log in and out successfully from a modal view.li liIve added 6 custom fields to my schema.xml, and the model builds correctly ie. I can query these fields in a tabulated User Manager.li liI can successfully register as a new user in the default route for registration on my overridden form, and the data shows up in my database as expected.li ul  pThe Issuep  pI have moved the registration form to its final position inside a modal view in my user manager dashboard. My form loads and displays correctly, but for whatever reason refuses to submit data to the controller for processing. Instead it simply loads the default route for registration register and displays the form again but without any of my css, js, or base twig template. When I reenter information in that form, it simply reloads with none of the info going in to the database.p  pI am convinced the issue lies in either or both how I am submitting the form or how I have classed the form.p  pNote I have changed the name of my classes to the statutory AcmeBundle for obvious reasons p  pCan anyone shed some light on this I am literally about to implode over this issuep  pThank you in advance Dp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI now think this could possibly be a routing issue as I have verified my form builds and collects all its values correctlyp  pstrongappconfig.ymlstrongp  precodeFOS UserBundle Configuration fosuser     dbdriver propel  other valid values are mongodb, couchdb and propel     firewallname main     userclass FOSUserBundlePropelUser     registration         form             type acmeuserregistration  Services services     acmeuser.registration.form.type         class AcmeUserBundleFormTypeRegistrationFormType         arguments [fosuser.model.user.class]         tags               name form.type, alias acmeuserregistration      acmeuser.form.handler.registration             class AcmeUserBundleFormHandlerRegistrationFormHandler             arguments [fosuser.registration.form, request, fosuser.usermanager, fosuser.mailer, fosuser.util.tokengenerator]             scope request codepre  pstrongapprouting.ymlstrong is standard FOSUserBundle config as per docsp  precode FOSUserBundle Routing fosusersecurity     resource FOSUserBundleResourcesconfigroutingsecurity.xml  fosuserprofile     resource FOSUserBundleResourcesconfigroutingprofile.xml     prefix profile  fosuserregister     resource FOSUserBundleResourcesconfigroutingregistration.xml     prefix register  fosuserresetting     resource FOSUserBundleResourcesconfigroutingresetting.xml     prefix resetting  fosuserchangepassword     resource FOSUserBundleResourcesconfigroutingchangepassword.xml     prefix profile codepre  pstrongAcmeUserBundleControllerRegistrationController.phpstrongp  precodeltphp  namespace AcmeUserBundleController  use FOSUserBundleControllerRegistrationController as BaseController use SymfonyComponentHttpFoundationResponse   class RegistrationController extends BaseController      public function renderview, array parameters  array, Response response  null              return parentrenderview, parameters, response        codepre  pstrongAcmeAdminBundleResourcesviewsaddUser.html.twigstrong this is where I call my modal inp  precode include FOSUserBundlelayout.html.twig   lt Modal gt ltdiv idregisterUser classrevealmodal xlarge  datarevealgt      lth2 aligncentergtAdd New Userlth2gt     lth6 aligncenter stylecolor redgtAll Fields are Requiredlth6gt       block fosusercontent           render urlfosuserregistrationregister       endblock       lta classcloserevealmodalgtamp215ltagt  ltdivgt codepre  pstrongappResourcesFOSUserBundleviewsRegistrationregister.html.twigstrong Overidden as per docsp  precode block fosusercontent       include FOSUserBundleRegistrationregistercontent.html.twig   endblock  codepre  pstrongappResourcesFOSUserBundleviewsRegistrationregistercontent.html.twigstrong Overidden as per docsp  precodeltform dataabide classfosuserregistrationregister action pathfosuserregistrationregister   formenctypeform  methodpost gt             ltfieldsetgt                 ltlegendgtPersonal Detailsltlegendgt                   First Name                  ltdivgt                     ltlabel forformfirstnamegtFirst Nameltlabelgt                     ltinput typetext idformfirstname nameform[firstname] required pattern[azAZ]gt                     ltsmall classerrorgtThis field is requiredltsmallgt                 ltdivgt                   Last Name                  ltdivgt                     ltlabel forformlastnamegtSurnameltlabelgt                     ltinput typetext idformlastname nameform[lastname] required pattern[azAZ]gt                     ltsmall classerrorgtThis field is requiredltsmallgt                 ltdivgt                  etc...                 etc...                 etc...              ltfieldsetgt             ltdivgt                 ltinput typesubmit value registration.submittrans, FOSUserBundle  gt             ltdivgt ltformgt codepre

For example, if I need to close the webview overlay, how do I do that The entire screen is server page. How do I control it from there Is it even possible to close the webview overlay when the overlay is full screen Is there other solutions I need to load the serve page inside my worklight application, not through browser, full screen, and be able to go back to my app. Thanks.p
Negative 33126 pIn my Blog a hrefhttpordealoftheunion.com relnofollowhttpordealoftheunion.coma My blog was previously hosted on Blogger and then was changed to a self hosted wordpress.org blog, Lots of things like Permalinks remained static until they were reindexed by Google. What i noticed is that someone links with.html redirected to the 404 Page instead of the new permalink structure in wordpress. for example when i clicked on an article from an old link ending in .html it redirected me to the 404 page instead of the actual article 201205barackkingfishobamaforpresident.html Which no longer works, since the permalinks changed the article is now located at 201205barackkingfishobamaforpresident to summarize how can i get .html to redirect to  p  pMany Thanksp  ul liRuslan.Kli ul
Negative 33126 pIs there a way to start running a query via SQL Server Management Studio SSMS SSMS or SQL Server Data Tools SSTD from your local workstation and then logoff  I know you could do a remote desktop connection to the server, run the query and then disconnect from the RDP session  but we are not allowed to do RPD sessions to production servers.  Has anyone used service broker for something like this  A SQL Server agent job could be created with an EXECUTE SQL task  but Id like a cleaner solution. p

Negative 33126 pFirst off, I have seen the other stack overflow answers marked as correct and none have worked for me. Clearly im being monumentally stupid, as I cant work out how to change the colour of the text or placeholder text in a search bar in iOS 7.p  pThe search bar is set to minimal style, and is set to display within the codeUINavigationBarcode which gives it a lovely blue tint, but the placeholder text remains grey so its not visible. Surely theres a simple fix for this that im missingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comShyzY.png altenter image description herep

Negative 33126 pIm trying to synchronize two sqlite core data databases and putting them back on device 2 iPads. For that Im writing a script in Python in order top  ul li1 copyexport 2 store.data databases corresponding to Core Data DB from each device. They derive and use the same model.li li2 creating a new database after merging them  I wrote a Python script that is working with union sqlite3 function. I have a newDatabase that includes both databases without duplication.li li3 I need to put this newDatabase back on both devices, erasing the old ones. Both will be the same.li ul  pMy problem is that I dont know how I can do that just in one click. I need to get the full pathname of the store.data file. I tried the code[[[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLsForDirectoryNSDocumentDirectory inDomainsNSUserDomainMask] lastObject]code to get the path but I am not sure if it is the same on real device. Second, I am not sure how I can use it. Should I save it somewhere on launching the app and then look up for it in my script and use again to save the new databasep  pIf anyone has already been looking for something like this or knows how to deal with copyexport file, it would be great.p

Negative 33126 h2Contexth2  pI am currently investigating the performance increase between my teams current build environment, which still uses gcc4.1.2, and a build using gcc4.8.1.  The results were astounding, with a weighted average of at least 25 speedup across a regression.  I also threw in another test using gcc4.4.7, but it only saw a weighted average for about 7 speedup.  I had speculated that the large discrepancy was related to the new C11 copymove semantics, and since memory transactions were a rather large bottleneck in our program.  We make extensive use of STL types, so perhaps the compiler made good use of their new move constructors.p  pTo verify my claims, I picked a test that showed the average performance improvement, and I ran kcachegrind on it for both compilations.  The results are posted below, and were not quite what I expected.  I should point out a quick and potentially relevant detail.  I had to statically compile gcc4.8.1s libstdc.so for bureaucracy reasons. This meant that kcachegrinds locations showed some private libraries that Ive censored for safety.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYUhl3.png altenter image description herep  pMuch to my surprise, the amount of calls to memory operations was relatively unchanged codemalloccode and codeintmalloccode.  Another interesting result is the completely absence of codememcpycode and the addition of codememcmpsse41code.p  h2Questionsh2  pIf I wanted to verify my hypothesis that C11 semantics are the reason for the improved performance, what should I be looking for in callgrind graphs  Should I find less memory accesses, or should I even find codestdstringstringampampcode signatures which I actually dont find here.  Keep in mind that this is compiled with codeO3code, which might mean that such signatures are optimized out, hence my dilemma.p  pI am more than happy to report such a large performance increase, but I would like to understand where this performance is coming from.  Let me know if more results need to be reported for more definitive answers.  I hope this isnt too general of a question for SO...p

If we have 10,000 integers in both arrays then these loops will take a lot of resources such as time, CPU and memory to be executed and get answer.p  pstrongHow can I solve above particular problem in more efficient waystrongp  precodefunction find A1, A2, ans    var a  []   for var i  0, len1  A1.length i lt len1 i      for var j  0, len2  A2.length j lt len2 j        if ans  A1[i]  A2[j]          a.pushi  ,   j                  return a  codepre  psecond p  precodefunction search A, B, ans    var arr  []   A.mapfunction v, i      B.filterfunction val, ind        if ans  v  val arr.pushi  ,  ind           return arr  codepre

Negative 33126 pWhen using codesetMultiChoiceItemsCursor cursor, String isCheckedColumn, String labelColumn, DialogInterface.OnMultiChoiceClickListener listenercode on my codeAlertDialog.Buildercode, how is it possible to know which rows are checked when the dialog is dismissedp  pMy code is based on a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuidialogs.html relnofollowthis examplea which only detects which checkboxes have been strongchangedstrong whilst the dialog was showing.p  pThis means if the codeisCheckedColumncode column contained all code0codes, it is easy enough at the end to know what has been selected. But if the codeisCheckedColumncode column contained one or more code1codes, then is the only way of knowing what the final selection is to do another database query on the codeisCheckedColumncode then superimposing the strongchangesstrong onto resultset and then saving back to the database... or is there a smarter wayp

Negative 33126 pI have a form for a user to add a book, they can also attach links to online stores that sell this book using jquery since I cant determine how many the person will add, they can add a online retailer from their own input or they can select from a pre existing retailers found in database, done row by row, the problem isp  pEach time a new row is added, it comes from a clone. p  pIf the person has added a online retailer in the text field as opposed to selecting a pre existing store, then select field should be disabled, or text field should be disabled if they have instead selected a pre existing retailer. This works for the first row but also affects other rows. p  pI only want this disabling mechanism to work row by rowp  pi.e. If I select a retailer on the first row, the retailer text field on that row should disable, but if I select no retailer on row 2, retailer text field on row 1 should not become enabledp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidetrue div classsnippetcode snippetcurrentlyhidden

This route would delegate the request to our custom codeStaticResourceHttpHandlercode, and the codeProcessRequestcode method is executedp  precodepublic void ProcessRequestHttpContext context      string file  routeData.Values[file].ToString     string basePath  GetBasePath     string fullPath  Path.CombinebasePath, file     var extension  file.Splitnew string[]  . , StringSplitOptions.None.Last     context.Response.Clear     ifFile.ExistsfullPath          context.Response.ContentType  GetContentTypeextension.ToLower         using FileStream stream  File.OpenReadfullPath             stream.CopyTocontext.Response.OutputStream      else         context.Response.StatusCode  intHttpStatusCode.NotFound  codepre  pAs you can see, our codeProcessRequestcode just check if the file exists in our file system, and if it exists it returns the files content along with the correct codeContentTypecode header, and HTTP Status Code of code200 OKcode.p  pThis worked well for us so far, until now.p  pWe are now o n the process of deploying our web application. We configured on the IIS that when a 404 is encountered, a redirect to an error page is made.p  pOur error page is a static codeaspxcode file.p  pIn our codeaspxcode, we have the following lines at the begginingp  precodelt     Response.Status  404 Not Found     Response.StatusCode  404 gt codepre  pWith this, we make sure that a code404 Not Foundcode status code is sent along with the error page, and not a code200 OKcode.p  pTHe problem is that our custom static HTTP handler, does not execute this codeaspxcode. In fact, it just outputs the content of it, with a status code of code200 OKcode, as it was told to do in the code.p  pHow can I solve this How can I make the code in the codeaspxcode file to be executed Can it be executed programatically If so, how can I do thisp  pWhat can be donep
Negative 33126 pI have noticed that developers of default apps for Android use Contract pattern. It is often used databases, content providers. Contract class is final and stores constants, and weird thing for me is inner interfaces. p  precodepublic final class ClockContract  protected interface AlarmsColumns extends AlarmSettingColumns, BaseColumns protected interface InstancesColumns extends AlarmSettingColumns, BaseColumns  protected interface CitiesColumns codepre  pAll this classes and interfaces is container for constants. Is it good approach to do like this. Why not to define them in each class  And is it good practice to store variables in interfaces.br And the most weir thing for me is the puprose of inner interfaces . Please explain the idea of this.br Thanksp

Negative 33126 pIve been trying to use Polymer for a project Im working on. And although I enjoyed it quite a lot so far, I ran into a problem I just cant solve. I dumped it down to a simple example. Basically its just a list element itemlist that contains item elements itemcard and i want to parse the items position to the element via the attribute pos. But for some reason the items attribute is allways undefined Is this because the attribute is bound to the variable i, which dies after the template repeat If so, how do I work around it Is there a different approach I should be using herep  pSOLUTION You can find the solution by reading through all the comments, but to sum it up apperantly there was a timing issue and the attribute wasnt ready at the codereadycode callback.

Negative 33126 pFor one of my high school independent study projects, I have to make a simple game specifically the game Snake using the SFML in Visual C yes I am new to C and SFML. I have coded the core and graphics of the game and now I am working on the audio and sound effects. I have read some of the things about audio in the SFML book, but was still confused on how to properly implement this into my code. I know that I have to make a sfSound and an sfSoundBuffer object, load using loadFromFile and openFromFile for sound and music respectively, and  use sound.play and sound.stop to play and stop respectively. However, this is where the question comes in. Do I load these objects in the main method, do I make them as global objects so I can use throughout the code, do I load in the function where the sfx takes place, do I make an object containing all the sound...Generally, how do I properly organize and implement these audio files within my code.

Negative 33126 pI am having an issue with an SKAction sequence I set up.  p  pThe goal of this sequence is to take an array of 9 sprite nodes and display one at a time.

Negative 33126 pI think I understand the concept. Let me explain how I understand it in terms of its application to codedoubling array vectorscode. p  blockquote   pThe rate of copying items to an array remains constant. While the growth of the array is exponential, the rate at which the array needs to double in size is logarithmic. Because of this, the decreased occurrence of doubling the array size sort of cancels out the resources required to double the array and copy its elements, as this only happens codeOn Log Ncode times throughout the life of the array. Thus, the codeOn2code for the rate of growth combined with codeOn Log Ncode for the frequency at which the array grows resolves to somewhere around codeOncode.p blockquote  pIs this correct If not, which parts are wrong Im having trouble wrapping my head around this. Im pretty sure that the Big Oh notation I gave is incorrect.p  pThanksp

Negative 33126 pUnder various circumstances, Automineer seems to be deciding that my commenting format isnt suitable, and adds newlines when I press tab.  p  pA second tab press, after the newline, actually behaves as a tab character.  Then the next tab after that becomes another newline, and it just keeps alternating between inserting new lines at the current indentation level and increasing the indentation level with each tab press after that.p  pAssuming I cant change this setting, this is most definitely a dealbreaker with automineer, since, while I like the style and customizability of the tool, I would really like to be able to format more advanced comments for doxygen such as matrices and tables so that they are still readable in the file, and I strongreallystrong dont feel like pressing space ten billion times to align things properly.p  pIm currently using the newest version of Automineer, in the trial, in Visual Studio 2013 Professional.p

Negative 33126 pstrongOverviewstrong I have a ListView of different types of rows including images and text of varying heights. At runtime, I am trying to dynamically set the heights of the layout containing the image based on the width of the row. So the rows width is set to matchparent because we want it to fill the width of the device, but the height must be calculated at runtime to get a specific aspect ratio for the frame. p  pHeres the code snippet from the Adapter that Im using p  precodeOverride public View getViewView convertView      if convertView  null          convertView  LayoutInflater.frommContext.inflate                 R.layout.chatrowimage, null         holder  new ViewHolderconvertView          convertView.setTagholder      else          holder  ViewHolder convertView.getTag           ViewTreeObserver observer  holder.videoFrame.getViewTreeObserver     observer.addOnGlobalLayoutListenernew ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener           Override         public void onGlobalLayout               TODO Autogenerated method stub             frameWidth  holder.container.getWidth             int width  frameWidth             int height  int frameWidth  Utilities.MEDIACELLASPECTRATIO              Log.dTAG, Calculated    width  ,  height              FrameLayout.LayoutParams params  new FrameLayout.LayoutParamswidth, height             holder.messageImage.setLayoutParamsparams             holder.videoFrame.getViewTreeObserver.removeGlobalOnLayoutListener                     this             Log.dTAG, Imageview    holder.messageImage.getWidth  ,  holder.messageImage.getHeight                   return convertView  codepre  pstrongThe problemstrong this code works well but during scrolling through the ListView, there are UI glitches that are readily noticeable. The main UI bug is that the rows have a predefined height from the XML file and are instantly transitioning to the new height weve calculated once the image finishes loading. This causes the entirety of contents below that row to suddenly shift as soon as the row appears on the screen. Also, were scrolling from the bottom to the top this is a chat thread. p  pstrongThings Ive triedstrong p  ol lipWe tried scrolling through the entire ListView via setSelection method from ListView to preload the contents before the user sees them. That didnt work and it doesnt seem like the images are loaded during the brief time were scrolling past them. pli lipWeve tried setting a static XML file width and height, and that fixes the issue, but doesnt account for different screen sizes. pli ol  pstrongWhat I need help withstrong We want to keep the scrolling smooth even while resizing the layout dynamically. The final resort would be to create different XML files for each screen size category and hard code the height, but that would not keep our frames aspect ratio as we desire. p  pPlease let me know if there are any clarifications you would want. Thanks in advance p
Negative 33126 pIm creating a single page application using flask. If I understand the process correctly, then ill be having flask serve up a single page html and css upon the first GET request. From their, the client will only receive data and the it will use already stored html partialsother pages to modify the site. p  pIdeally, I would like to use something that provides a nicer syntax then html, something like slim, haml or jade. Though i dont need the templating aspect, as this functionality will be provided through angularJS.p  pAssuming the above is correct, my confusion is how to use pyjade or any such tool with flask to transform the partials that the client side application would be using. For example, if i have some client side code that creates the routes like so...p  pvar app  angular.moduleAppp  precodeapp.configfunctionrouteProvider     routeProvider.when,          templateURL partialshome.jade,         controller HomeController         .otherwise redirectTo    codepre  pThen i would need home.jade to be transformed into home.html when it was served up to the client.

Negative 33126 pI want to make a view that is composed of some textViews and buttons in the head of the view, and some tabs below these textViews and buttons. I am using for that a class that is implementing ActionBar.TabListener, but the problem is that tabs stay above in the view and textViews and buttons come below them, which is the opposite of what I want. I think that the interface ActionBar.TabListener is not suitable as a solution to this problem.

Negative 33126 pThe phowcaltech101 demo app in vlfeat creates a complete Bag of Words process for image classification on the Caltech101 dataset, roughly putp  ul liFeature Extractionli liVisual Vocabulary buildingli liSpatial Histograms computationli liSVM trainingli liSVM testing and evaluation,li ul  pobtaining a model that can be used to later classify new, unclassified instances.  The only problem the histograms computed are spatial histograms, this means if I have a visual vocabulary of size n, I would have expected the histogram to have size n x sizecollection, containing the ocurrences of each visual word in each training instance. p  pThe spatial histograms, however, are stored in a structure according to the model specified, by default it has two spatial arguments, spatialX and spatialY, which results in a structure with size spatialX  spatialY  sizevocabulary which is later normalized and this is the one used to train the SVM. p  pNow, what if i want to use the normal histogram, normalized or not, but the histogram that gives me a 11 correspondance on visual word per image, or obtain this information from the spatial histogram Also, how much more efficient is the use of the spatial histogram instead of the classical one I take into account when I picture the Bag of Words processp  pAny help appreciated.p  pUPDATEp  pHere is part of the code where the histograms are computed, you can see how instead of ending with a histogram vector of size numbervisualwords you end up with a histogram of size spatialX  spatialY  numbervisualwords. Let me clarify, in this case, the model is defined to have spatialX  [2 4] and spatialY  [2 4].p  precodefor i  1lengthmodel.numSpatialX   binsx  vlbinsearchlinspace1,width,model.numSpatialXi1, frames1,    binsy  vlbinsearchlinspace1,height,model.numSpatialYi1, frames2,      combined quantization   bins  sub2ind[model.numSpatialYi, model.numSpatialXi, numWords], ...              binsy,binsx,binsa    hist  zerosmodel.numSpatialYi  model.numSpatialXi  numWords, 1    hist  vlbinsumhist, onessizebins, bins    histsi  singlehist  sumhist  end hist  cat1,hists  hist  hist  sumhist  codepre  pAnd part of the problem is that I havent worked with spatial histogram either, so Im not sure how much better than normal histograms they are. Maybe someone who has worked with this kind of histograms before could give a more helpful insight.p

Negative 33126 pIve recently been assigned to work on a Java project.  I dont have a lot of experience with this kind of development, so Im kind of struggling.br The typical development process for this project isp  ol liMake changes in source code li liRun ant build script to create EARli liDeploy EAR to development server Weblogic 12.1.2  li liRun application and see if the changes youve made fix the issue youre working on.li ol  pSo, I am taking it as my personal goal to make it possible to do local development, so debugging will actually work and such.p  pAfter spending time googling and playing around, Im able to get at least part of the way, but am having trouble towards the end of the process.p  pIve tried some different methods to try to get things working.p  pFirst, I checked out the source code via Eclipse, so it shows up as a Project and is correctly linked to subversion.  I can bring the build.xml file into the Ant view and build the target Im interested in.  This gives me a EAR file and a WAR file.  But when I try to debug the project, via the rightclick on the project and selecting Debug As... I get three options  Java Applet, Java Application, JUnit Test.p  pIf I choose Java Applet, I then get a Select Java Applet popup.  After choosing what I think is the right applet I get Errors exist in required projects, Proceed with launch  If I proceed, I get an Applet Viewer and a bajillion errors and nothing else.  If I dont proceed, then the Error log fills up with a bajillion other errors.p  pIf I choose Java Application I get a list of a bunch of different entries, none of which is what Im trying to debug.p  pSo, after trying all that, I decided to see if I could just import the generated EAR file and debug that way.  So, I went through the Import wizard, found the EAR file that I build via Ant.  After selecting that and proceeding through the dialog, I get two projects in my Project Explorer the application well call it AppX and the AppXWEB project.p  pNow, if I select the AppX project and choose Debug As, I get Debug On Server, which is promising.  The Console tells me that the server is listening on 127.0.0.17001, and the builtin browser actually starts bringing up the page.  So Im feeling pretty good about all that.p  pThe problem is, though, I dont know how to attach that EAR file to the source tree that Ive got already so I can actually step through the code. p  pAnd going deeper, how do I set it up so that I can develop in my source tree and have them automatically propagated into the EAR file and redeployedp  pOr, even better, can I get this working without having to build the EAR file and deploy it  Meaning, can I just run straight from the source treep  pAnyway, any help you can give will be much appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 33126 pI was wondering if someone could explain why do websites using AB testing, have a very long hash stored inside a cookie.p  pIn the context of a single page application, lets assume that I just want to show a different background color. I can store an AB identifier, for example 0 or 1, inside a cookie when the user logs in, and then, in my javascript code, check for that cookies value, and render the right color.p  pBut why are others not using simple identifiers, and they use long hashes I mean, this cant be a security thing right Because, no matter how long the hash might be, it still needs to be readable by the client side javascript, so the decoding script, which might be as simple as multiple ifelse statements, is still available to everyone.p  pThank you. p

Negative 33126 pIm quite new to HTML amp CSS but currently facing a bit of a problem. Ive two pages one html5, one php, say page1.html and page2.php. Both pages have a jquery js and two css filesone for jquery, one for jquery mobile attached to them. There is a hyperlink that can be used to navigate from page1 to page2. page2.php generates a table using data retrieved from a MYSQL table.p  pIf page2 is loaded into a browser directly, it displays quite well and all the styles are applied as expected. However, all hell breaks loose, if page2 is navigated to from page1. In that instance, the table appear to loose all the styles and is not displayed correctly. As a matter of fact, looks quite horrible.p  pMy thinking is that the two pages are independent of each other. Is it possible for some style settings in page1 to be responsible for this baffling situation. This is really driving me nuts.p  pBy the way Im using Dreamweaver 6 as the IDE.   p

Negative 33126 pThe issue Im running into is defining the arguments of a function where the data structure is defined in a different file. In the main file I define the arrays codenPart[3]a,b,ccode  and codeparticle p[np]code where codea,b,c,npcode are integers. I then define the arrayp  precodeparticle pp[ nPart[0] ][ nPart[1] ][ nPart[2] ][ np ] codepre  pwhich points to different particles in the codepcode array.p  pIn a second file I want to create a functionp  precodevoid functionint np, particle p, particle pp[ nPart[0] ][ nPart[1] ][ nPart[2] ][ np ]... codepre  phowever since I have defined codenPartcode in the first file Im unsure how I should do this. The second files .h file is included in the first document.p  pI feel like I should somehow pass codenPartcode as an argument to the function, along with some information about the location of codeppcode and then be able to construct codeppcode inside the function however Im pretty lost as to how I should go about this.p  pEDIT My lack of knowledge of terminology and C in general is probably making this more confusing that it should be.p  pIll try to make a simple examplep  pIn the first files main function I definep  precodeint x[3]  1,2,2 int p[ x[0] ][ x[1] ][ x[2] ] codepre  pThen in the second file I want to be able to be able to use codepcode as an argument to functions. However, since codexcode is defined locally in the main function Im unsure how to do this.p  pThe reason Im trying to define codepcode in terms of codexcode is that there are other things which also depend on codexcode and so I want to be able to adjust just codexcode rather than manually changing everything.p  pEDIT 2 It seems that by switching the order of the arguments in my original code with codenPartcode before codeppcode I am able to do what I wanted to do.p  psee relemos answer here  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4051passingmultidimensionalarraysasfunctionargumentsincPassing multidimensional arrays as function arguments in Cap  pI guess I just wasnt searching with the right terminology the first time I looked for answers. p

How should I proceed to expand my tests and make them actually usefulp

Negative 33126 pLet me introduce the goal of the application Im building I am creating a frontend GUI using PySide Qt for a fortran based application used in the framework of CFD. The fortran application is compiled as a .exe file, and, when executed, it continuously provides the simulated lapse of time and other output details when I launch it from the console, these data continously appear until it finishes. p  pFor example, if I executed the external code from the console I would getp  precodegtgt myCFDapplication.exe    Initializing...

From other similar topics in this site, I have been able to launch my external application from Python using the following codep  precodeimport os, sys import subprocess  procExe  subprocess.Popenpru, shellTrue, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, stderrsubprocess.PIPE, universalnewlinesTrue  while procExe.poll is None line  procExe.stdout.readline printPrint  line codepre  pbut the output is only displayed when the execution finishes, and moreover, the whole GUI freezes until that moment.p  pI would like to know how to launch my external application using Python, getting the output in real time and passing it to the GUI instantaneously, if possible. The idea would be to print the output in different lines inside a TextEdit dialog using the function appendeachoutputline.p

Negative 33126 pI have a Hadoop cluster with 3 machines, 1 NameNode and 2 DataNodes. I was in the process of upgrading from code2.5.1code to code2.7.1code but at some point decided to stay with code2.5.1code for now temporarily. As the various hdfs commands like codelscode, codecatcode, codecopyFromLocalcode working and I was able to read and write files I assumed things were working fine. But I noticed  a huge amount of codeeditlogcode files. Furthermore, the codefsimagecode was stuck at the transaction code00000code. At this point I suspected that no checkpointing was made which was confirmed by entries in the logs. Then I checked the codeVERSIONcode in both NN and DNs. Although the clusterID was the same in all 3 machines, I realized that the the codelayoutVersioncode was different in NameNode 57 and DataNodes 55.

When i leave for example form for Person empty, it always shout out that PersonRodneCislo is required field. p  pstrongFirm tablestrong and strongPerson tablestrong are in 1...N relationship to strongInsurance tablestrong, coz person can have multiple insurances same as firm, but it cannot be opposite side.p  pFor table Firm primary key is Ico For table Person primary key is PersonRodneCislo For table Insurance primary key is InsuranceNumberp  pso in my database model Insurance table has 2 foreign keys Ico and PersonRodneCislop  pI tried use IsNullOrWhiteSpace method but problem is that it wont even reach to my create method so i have to force EF somehow to ignore one of those two field if one of them is filledp  pCode for [POST] Create methodp  precode        public ActionResult Create[BindInclude  PersonRodneCislo, FirstName, LastName, Street, City, PSC, PhoneNumber, SecondaryStreet, SecondaryCity, SecondaryPSC]Person person,                                [BindInclude  InsuranceNumber,Premium,PaymentFrequency,AnnualDate,BeginDate,EndDate,ProductType,PersonRodneCislo] Insurance insurance,                                [BindInclude  Ico,Street,City,PSC] Firm firm              try                      ViewBag.ProductType  new SelectListdb.Product, ProductType, ProductName              TODO Add insert logic here             if ModelState.IsValid                              ifString.IsNullOrWhiteSpacefirm.Ico.ToString ampamp String.IsNullOrWhiteSpaceperson.PersonRodneCislo.ToString                                      ModelState.AddModelErrorIco, Vlote prosm IO nebo rodn slo                                  if String.IsNullOrWhiteSpacefirm.Ico.ToString                                      insurance.PersonRodneCislo  person.PersonRodneCislo                                   if db.Person.Anyx gt x.PersonRodneCislo  person.PersonRodneCislo                                              db.Person.Addperson                         db.Insurance.Addinsurance                                          else                                              db.Insurance.Addinsurance                                                       if String.IsNullOrWhiteSpaceperson.PersonRodneCislo.ToString                                      insurance.Ico  firm.Ico                                    if db.Firm.Anyx gt x.Ico  firm.Ico                                              db.Firm.Addfirm                         db.Insurance.Addinsurance                                          else                                              db.Insurance.Addinsurance                                                       db.SaveChanges                          return RedirectToActionIndex                  catch                      return Viewinsurance               codepre
