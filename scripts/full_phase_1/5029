It is like a chain.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI updated my question, as you can see codeMyClasscode has a method called codedoSomethingcode, instead codeOtherClasscode has a method called codedoSomethingInMyClasscode which calls the codedoSomethingcode method but updates some parameters. What i want is to avoid to use codedoSomethingInMyClasscode and get notified of the changes anyway.p
Positive 5029 pI have three assemblies. A main executable, a common library and an extension. In the extension, I need to implement a certain interface coming from the common assembly in order to register the class as a service in a static codeKernelcode class. p  pThe only problem, I dont have access to some types needed to implement the interface. For instance, the interface codeAcode has a method codeDoWorkcode that has a return type codeBcode. The extension assembly doesnt have the codeBcode type in its references and it cannot be added. p  pIs there a way to implement the interface, make the method throw a codeNotImplementedExceptioncode and have the extension assembly compilep  pNote, the main assembly needs to reference the extension in order to register it, so I cant reference the main assembly in the extension and declare the type in the main one.p

Positive 5029 pI am working with Java of late, and was wondering whether there was any kind of interface implementation derivation in Java. My preferred programming language is Haskell, which is in many ways antithetical to Java, but one feature that I was wondering whether Java had anything like is the ability to derive interface implementations of compound types from the interface implementations of their parameters. For example, in Haskellp  precodedata Pair k v  Pair k v  instance Ord k gt Ord Pair k v where     compare Pair x  Pair x   compare x x codepre  pThis allows you to order a codePaircode if its first parameter can be ordered, without explicitly requiring that to be the case. However, the closest I can come  to this in Java is through explicit requirementp  precodeclass PairltK extends ComparableltKgt, Vgt extends ComparableltPairltK,Vgtgt      K k     V v     public int compareToPairltK,Vgt p          return k.compareTop.k       codepre  pWithout a way of leaving the comparability to be inferred, it is impossible for me to implement a BST of pairs without ensuring that all pairs have a comparable first element, so I cannot implement any kind of Map where the first element is not explicitly required to be Comparable. Is there any way around this, other than creating a method of my BST class that attempts to compare the generic type by casting it first as comparable, and then as a Pair with a comparable key, comparing whenever comparability is possiblep

Positive 5029 pIm very new to pfSense, but got requested to configure one for the company.p  pIve almost got everything configured, but am stuck at how to let all our WANs go through one uplink address. From what I am hearing, this should be possible to accomplish. Ive tried looking it up on both the pfSense Guide as well as the forums, but since I cant find a related situation to mine, I hereby ask you guys for some help.p  pWhat it looks like now with example WAN IPsp  pWAN1 000.000.000.58 with internal IP addresses on LAN1 192.168.1.1  192.168.1.245 WAN2 000.000.000.61 with internal IP addresses on LAN2 192.168.2.1  192.168.2.245 WAN3 000.000.000.59 with internal IP addresses on LAN3 192.168.3.1  192.168.3.245p  pThe way I have it set up now is as followsp  pFirst I configured all the interfaces, whereas I now have 3 WAN interfaces with Static IPv4 addresses configured. Example WAN1 interace has a static IP of 000.000.000.59 and an IPv4 Upstream Gateway 000.000.000.57 which would be the broadcast address for all WANs.p  pThe problems start right here, because I cant add this address to anymore interfaces, because it already exists, but isnt selectable from the dropdown menu. This is one of the reasons why we want one WAN interface to handle all three of our WAN addresses with one uplink address.p  pSo the question in short is there a way to have one uplinkupstream address for all WANs. And if so, is there also a way to have just one WAN interface and three LAN interfaces in the following wayp  pWAN interface must have an uplinkupstream gateway of 000.000.000.57 for the following WAN addresses 000.000.000.58, 000.000.000.59 and 000.000.000.61 whereasp  pWAN1 000.000.000.58  for LAN1 interface w internal range of 192.168.1.1  192.168.1.245 WAN2 000.000.000.61  for LAN2 interface w internal range of 192.168.2.1  192.168.2.245 WAN3 000.000.000.59  for LAN3 interface w internal range of 192.168.3.1  192.168.3.245p  pWAN interface is not going to get a DHCP function, because it needs to be all three of the WAN addresses. The LAN interfaces are going to get the DHCP function for the ranges listed above.p  pIn other words p  ul liall traffic from the 192.168.1.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.58 and then through the uplink of 000.000.000.57li liall traffic from the 192.168.2.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.61 and then through the uplink of 000.000.000.57li liall traffic from the 192.168.3.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.59 and then through the uplink of 000.000.000.57li ul  pCan this be done, yes or nop  pIf you need any more information, feel free to ask and Ill happily elaborate.p  pThank you very much in advancep  pGrtz,p  pJeffp

Now its time for implementation, but here comes the problem How do I access a label or an image from my Fragment to my recycler view headerp  pI know  the other way around, on button click, on any event handler from any recycler view holder to my fragment, but I cant figure out how to do it this way.p  pemwhyemp  pIn my header view is a EditText, Button and label.

Positive 5029 pI came across this design, So I am not quite sure which way to lean towards. Any help would be much appreciatedp  precodeI have three levels a Dialog b Controller c View codepre  pThe Dialog creates the Controller and the view object.

The controller implements the listener,again no implementation change from the dialog and adds it to the view. The view notifies the controller and then the controller notifies the Dialog and the dialog performs the action as needed.p  pSo the Dialog creates the controller and implements the above interface and adds it to the controller.p  pShould the controller implement the same interface again or should it be a different interface.p  pAs of now the implementation detail are the same, but I think since we look this as a layer.p  precodeShould I have it like this a View Listener b Controller Listener codepre  pAnd make the Dialog implement the Controller listener and the Controller implement the view listener.p  pLike thisp  precodeInterface DoSomthingContollerListener int doSomthingController   Interface DoSomthingViewListener int doSomthingView  codepre  pOr just have a generic listener in both the view and controller and implement them differently.p  pThe problem I had having them as a generic listener is,I think since we use an MVCthough the above does not follow MVC at all type design the interface should be for each level.p  pAm I wrongp

Positive 5029 pSorry if the question title is not clear but I needed more characters to fully explain myself.p  pBefore people start jumping to conclusions, YES I know about isInstance and instanceof but hear me out first.p  pLets say I generate a java .class file of an interface called MyInterface from a UML model. Then, lets say that there is a directory somewhere that contains two .class files where one represents an interface that is IDENTICAL to the generated one same fully qualified name, both using the default package and the other represents the concrete class that implements MyInterface.p  pIn a separate program, I load in the generated interface and concrete class with separate classloaders URLClassLoader. When I try to check if the concrete class implements the generated version of the interface, isInstance returns False. I suspect this is because when the concrete class is loaded, the nongenerated interface gets pulled in with it because it implements it. If I use Class.getInterfaces on the concrete class and compare its interface with the generated one using equals, this also fails.p  pSince isInstance does not work does anyone know of a way to  verify that a class implements an interface with the same fully qualified name and not necessarily the one it was compiled with p

Positive 5029 pis it possible to inherit the implementation of an interface without implementing it for each implementationp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com1aGmw.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1aGmw.jpg altenter image description hereap  pIn the image above codeIBasecode and codeIchildcode are classes having only pure virtual methods and codeBasecode implements the methods of codeIBasecode and codeChildcode implements the methods of codeIChildcode.

Positive 5029 pI have for example an Interface A and B. A has an abstract method called foo. B extends A.p  pIt is possible to override foo in the interface B even with Override, but is there any situation where that makes sense There is nothing to override, because both methods have to be abstract and have no body. So I guess there is no situation where this makes sense, rightp  pSo why is it possible to override in an interfacep

Positive 5029 pIm implementing Python 2.7.9 as an interface between my Arduino with a joystick and a couple of buttons and my Linux machine to control Megaman on an emulator.

Ive checked my serial output to see if this was hardware sided, and it isnt the serial string being received is clean as it should be looking something like this [X510][Y510]kt.

Negative 5029 pLets assume you have one massive table with three columns as shown belowp  precode[id] INT NOT NULL,  [date] SMALLDATETIME NOT NULL,  [sales] FLOAT NULL codepre  pAlso assume you are limited to one physical disk and one filegroup PRIMARY.  You expect this table to hold sales for 10,000,000 ids, across 100s of dates easily 1B records.p  pAs with many data warehousing scenarios, the data will typically grow sequentially by date i.e., each time you perform a data load, you will be inserting new dates, and maybe updating some of the more recent dates of data.  For analytic purposes, the data will often be queried and aggregated for a random set of 10,000 ids which will be specified via a join with another table.  Often, these queries dont specify date ranges, or specify very wide date ranges, which leads me to my question  What is the best way to index  partition this tablep  pI have thought about this for a while, but am stuck with conflicting solutionsp  pstrongOption 1strong  As data will be loaded sequentially by date, define the clustered index and primary key as [date], [id].  Also create a sliding window partitioning function  scheme on date allowing rapid movement of new data in  out of the table.  Potentially create a nonclustered index on id to help with querying.p  pstrongExpected Outcome 1strong  This setup will be very fast for data loading purposes, but suboptimal when it comes to analytic reads as, in a worst case scenario no limiting by dates, unlucky with set of ids queried, 100 of the data pages may be read.p  pstrongOption 2strong  As the data will be queried for only a small subset of ids at a time, define the clustered index and primary key as [id], [date].  Do not bother to create a partitioned table.p  pstrongExpected Outcome 2strong  Expected huge performance hit when it comes to loading data as we can no longer quickly limit by date.  Expected huge performance benefit when it comes to my analytic queries as it will minimize the number of data pages read.p  pstrongOption 3strong Clustered and primary key as follows [id], [date] sliding window partition function  scheme on date.p  pstrongExpected Outcome 3strong Not sure what to expect.  Given that the first column in the clustered index is [id] and thus it is my understanding the data is arranged by ID, I would expect good performance from my analytic queries.  However, the data is partitioned by date, which is contrary to the definition of the clustered index but still aligned as date is part of the index.  I havent found much documentation that speaks to this scenario and what, if any, performance benefits I may get from this, which brings me to my final, bonus questionp  pIf I am creating a table on one filegroup on one disk, with a clustered index on one column, is there any benefit besides partition switching when loading the data that comes from defining a partition on the same columnp

Negative 5029 pIm using part of the a hrefhttpgithub.comjoehewittthree20treemaster relnofollowThree20a library in a project. Specifically, a view that is essentially a table view with images going 4wide across each cell to mimic the iPhones photo app thumbnail view. p  pIve noticed that the behavior is for each cell to be dequeued as soon as the bottom of the cell reaches the bottom of the navigation bar which is translucent so we can actually see it disappearing.  The problem this presents is that each time a cell is dequeued and then brought back into view it reloads the images, which causes the scrolling to become very jittery at anything beyond a slow scroll of the table. I know the cells are reused to minimize memory usage, but is it possible to prevent the cells from being dequeued Or redefine the boundary for when theyre prepped for reuse to create a larger buffer so they only disappear when theyre a certain number of rows off screenp

Negative 5029 pI apologize for being a bit verbose in advance if you want to skip all the background mumbo jumbo you can see my question down below.p  pThis is pretty much a follow up to a question I previously posted on how to compare two 1D time dependent signals. One of the answers I got was to use the crosscorrelation function xcorr in MATLAB, which I did. p  h2Background informationh2  pPerhaps a little background information will be useful Im trying to implement an Independent Component Analysis algorithm. One of my informal tests is to 1 create the test case by a generate 2 random vectors 1x1000, b combine the vectors into a 2x1000 matrix called S, and multiply this by a 2x2 mixing matrix called A, to give me a new matrix lets call it T. p  pIn summary T  A  Sp  p2 I then run the ICA algorithm to generate the inverse of the mixing matrix called W, 3 multiply T by W to hopefully give me a reconstruction of the original signal matrix called Xp  pIn summary X  W  Tp  p4 I now want to compare S and X. Although S and X are 2x1000, I simply compare codeS1,code to codeX1,code and codeS2,code to codeX2,code, each which is 1x1000, making them 1D signals. I have another step which makes sure that these vectors are the proper vectors to compare to each other and I also normalize the signals. p  pSo my current quandary is how to grade how close codeS1,code matches to codeX1,code, and likewise with codeS2,code to codeX2,code.p  pSo far I have used something like coder1  maxabsxcorrS1,, X1,codep  h2My questionh2  pAssuming that using the cross correlation function is a valid way to go about comparing the similarity of two signals, what would be considered a good R value to grade the similarity of the signals Wikipedia states that this is a very subjective area, and so I defer to the better judgment of those who might have experience in this field. p  pAs you might realize, Im not coming from a EEDSPstatistical background at all Im a medical student so Im going through a sort of baptism through fire right now, and I appreciate all the help I can get.

Negative 5029 pIm writing EAGLView  based application game and need to add UIViewController with UIWebView in landscape mode. p  pWhat I donep  ol lipSpecified UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight for UIInterfaceOrientation in the Info.plistpli lipCall [application setStatusBarOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight animatedNO] in the applicationDidFinishLaunchingpli lipSpecified shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation for my ViewController class like thisp  precode BOOL shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientation orientation        return [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientationorientation  codepre  p pli lipCreated new ViewController and add its view into main window subviewp  precodeSViewController VC  [[SViewController alloc] init] [gEAGLView.window addSubview  VC.view] codepreli ol  pSViewController is my class derived from UIViewControllerp  pWhat I have. First time I created ViewController its displayed correctly in landscape mode. But every next times  its displayed only in portrait mode. After placing breakpoint in the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation and examining call stack  I noticed that internal function UIWindowupdateToInterfaceOrientation calls only on first ViewController creation. Then I put manual call of updateToInterfaceOrientation each time after adding subview  and problem disappears  every time ViewController displayed in the landscape mode. But apparently, its wrong way to use undocumented functions. How can I cause UIWindowupdateToInterfaceOrientation call by documented functions only  Or maybe I missed something with landscape mode p  pThanks a lot. p

Negative 5029 pI am trying to dynamically resize an flv playing back in a flash player. To do this, I need to get the flvs widthheight so I can maintain the original aspect ratio.p  pI have noticed that in Firefox the onMetaData event will be hit right away, and the video will resize properly. In IE however, onMetaData is not hit until the buffer is full and video starts playing.p  pOne solution I have thought of is to set the initial buffer to something close to 0 e.g. 0.01. Then the buffer will instantly hit full, and the video will be resized.p  pThe issue I have with this is low bandwidth users will have a a short sputter of video 0.5 seconds say at the beginning before it goes to the next, larger, buffer.p  pIs there any better way to deal with this behavior in IE Can you manually get the metaData from an FLV file before it even playsp

The join group messages isnt sent via 192.168.52 but via a different NIC.p  pprep  p sockettst.cpp  Defines the entry point for the console application. p  pinclude tchar.h include winsock2.h include ws2ipdef.h include IpHlpApi.h include IpTypes.hp  pinclude stdio.hp  pint tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]    WSADATA       mwsaData   SOCKET        msocket   sockaddrin   msockAdr   UINT16        mport  319   ulong        minterfaceAdr  inetaddr192.168.1.52   ulong        mmulticastAdr  inetaddr224.0.0.107p  pint returnValue  WSAStartupMAKEWORD2,2, ampmwsaData   if returnValue  SOK        return returnValue   p  p Create sockets   if INVALIDSOCKET  msocket  socketAFINET, SOCKDGRAM, IPPROTOUDP         return WSAGetLastError   p  pint doreuseaddress  TRUE   if setsockoptmsocket,SOLSOCKET,SOREUSEADDR,char ampdoreuseaddress,sizeofdoreuseaddress  SOCKETERROR        return  WSAGetLastError    p  p Configure socket addresses   memsetampmsockAdr,0,sizeofmsockAdr   msockAdr.sinfamily         AFINET   msockAdr.sinport           htonsmportbr   msockAdr.sinaddr.saddr    minterfaceAdrp  pbind sockets   if  bind msocket, SOCKADDR ampmsockAdr, sizeofmsockAdr    SOCKETERROR         return  WSAGetLastError   p  p join multicast   struct ipmreqsource imr p  pmemsetampimr,0,sizeofimr   imr.imrmultiaddr.saddr   mmulticastAdr  address of multicastgroup   imr.imrsourceaddr.saddr  0               sourceaddress not used   imr.imrinterface.saddr   minterfaceAdr  interface address    first join multicast group, then registerer selected interface as     multicast sending interface    if setsockopt msocket                    ,IPPROTOIP                   ,IPADDMEMBERSHIP                   ,char ampimr                   , sizeofimr                     SOCKETERROR        return SOCKETERROR      else        if setsockoptmsocket                    ,IPPROTOIP                   ,IPMULTICASTIF                   ,CHARampimr.imrinterface.saddr                   ,sizeofampimr.imrinterface.saddr                     SOCKETERROR             return SOCKETERROR        p  pprintfreceiving msgs...n   while1         get inputbuffer from socket     int sockreturn  SOCKETERROR     sockaddrin socketAddress     char buffer[1500]p  codeint addressLength  sizeofsocketAddress sockreturn  recvfrommsocket, char ampbuffer, 1500, 0, SOCKADDRampsocketAddress, ampaddressLength  if sockreturn  SOCKETERROR    int wsaerror  WSAGetLastError   return wsaerror   else    printfgot messagen  codepre  pp  preturn 0 p  pp  pThanks four your helpp

But I am having some trouble with implementing it, as the LineChart was originally written in FLEX 3 and my project being FLEX 4. It finally displays correctly with all data supplied but I cannot click on anything on the LineChart without receiving an error.p  pI would like to point out that this is not a duplicate question, as a similar question has been answered on stackoverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2879474adobeflashbuiderflex4error2025orerroraddchildisnotavailableinherea. My question is eerily similar, except my project already uses the  namespace from what I can tell, which is mentioned as the fix in the previous stackoverflow answer. Maybe I am not using the namespace correctly, in the correct places I am unsure and can post more of my components and their code if necessary. I might be speaking greek here, or might be confusing some of you, but I am only 6 days into my FLEX development lifespan, so please excuse my ignorance as this is a completely new field for me.p  pI was able to get my hands on the .SWC files needed for the FLEX 4 upgrade for Axiis and Degrafa4, thanks to some really nice guys working on the open source projects for these tools.

This is not my case at all, there is no explicit adding or removing in my code that I could change. This leads me to believe this is a namespaceframeworklibrary problem, or that my project is not designed correctly from a UICanvasNamespace standpoint. I am not familiar enough with FLEX 4 to know where to use the Spark, MXML, MX namespaces s,fx, mx, etc. p  pAny help or ideas are appreciated, as this bug is a current show stopper.

Negative 5029 pIm wondering what would be considered best practise for this. Its fairly inconsequential but Im interested in peoples opinions.p  pWe have two classes  TitleBar and TemplateMain. TitleBar is a bar at the top of the screen that displays the project title and several buttons settings, print, fullscreen, etc that the TemplateMain will need to listen to in order to run the relevant functions. At the moment, the Template listens for the click mouseevent and then uses a switch statement to get the initial target of the event, egp  precodeprotected function onTitleBarClickeMouseEventvoid    switch e.target     case titleBar.settingsButton             addSettings             break            etc..        codepre  pWould there be any advantage or is it desirable to port this into a custom event system, either extending the native Event class or maybe even as3signals so that the titlebar itself has the click listener and then dispatches an event that TemplateMain picks up and then acts accordingly One negative of this I can see is that, along with mouse click listener, Id end up with another six listeners for the custom events.p  pLike I said, maybe it doesnt matter but Id like to know how others handle this very common situation.p

Negative 5029 pIm building a locationbased web app that will run primarily on mobile browsers. It will be coded with HTML5, javascript, and PHP. Id like the user to have to be prompted to login as infrequently as practical. Id like them to login via PHP and then stayed logged in for x amount of time.p  pI know how to do this with cookies, but Ive been experimenting with HTML5 localStorage. If I use localStorage, I have to do all the validation with javascript and send it to PHP via Ajax. As Im thinking through how to get this done, I wonder if using localStorage is really worth it. From what I understand, its more secure than cookies because the data is not transmitted with every HTTP request, and it cant be accessed crossdomain. But dont modern browsers, like iOS and Android, prevent crossdomain access to cookiesp  pAm I just making it harder on myself by using localStorage What are the reasons to choose localStorage over cookies in a case like this p

Negative 5029 pI want to test for an intersection of a ray with a voxel field.p  pI could naively crawl through the voxel field by calculating a raybox intersection with the edge of the current voxel, then doing the same for the next voxel until I hit something.

Negative 5029 pI am about to tackle my first Mac OSX project after developing for iOS. In my iOS applications, it is clear to me the whole NavigationViewControllerMyViewControllerMyViews paradigm.p  pA bit more background on the iOS app so it would be easier to understand me The application is some sort of graphic viewer. Once you login you have a list of drawings, and if you select one, it opens it up.  Now in the iOS app I have a custom UIViewController that have some menu UI and a UIScrollView that holds a UIView in which I draw the drawing. The custom UIViewController is responsible for acting as the application where the UIView inside is merely a graphic context.p  pNow  back to Mac I was thinking that my main window would show the drawings and once one is selected, I would add another window with an NSView that is the graphic context of the drawing, and the window will be acting as the UIViewController in the iOS app.p  pDoes that make sensep

This only happens along the edges that have a transparent window region so the white pixels are always constrained within the maximum rectangle of the parent window.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxHDCN.png altenter image description herep  pThings correct themselves if the parent window is hidden and then shown just invalidating and forcing a redraw does not clear the white pixels.p  pThis has been observed on both Vista and 7.  This behavior goes away if I disable the Desktop Window Manager DWM.  In one case, it also went away after updating graphics drivers.  Perhaps its related to this issue a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions483812vistalivethumbnailissuewithsetwindowrgnVista live thumbnail issue with SetWindowRgna.  I was originally going to just file this away as a rare bug, but its cropped up enough to warrant a lot more scrutiny.p  pHas anyone else run up against this before  Any insights into how DWM and window regions interactp  pAlso, Im aware I can disable DWM perapplication, but that disables it for everything while the app is running, in addition to causing the screen to blip on startup and shutdown, and thats really not a much better problem.p

Negative 5029 pIm writing a program in C that acquires 4 dimensional points data over a UDP socket and then plots the data in 6 separate 2D scatter plots. For example if we name the dimensions A,B,C,D the six 2d plots would be AxB, AxC, AxD, BxC, BxD, and CxD.  Over the course of a few hours the program accrues 50K points. p  pCurrently I plot each point once, using immediate mode. I dont clear the buffer between draw calls so previously plotted points persist until the buffer is cleared.  Im not happy with this method as immediate mode is slow and deprecated.  When I have to clear the buffer, as when a window resizes, I lose all previously plotted data.  Id like to come up with a solution that allows data persistence after the buffer is cleared. Additionally it would be nice if the plot could be easily scaled with window resizes as well.p  pIve thought about maintaining a vertex array with 2 dimensions for each coordinate system but that would require 6 separate arrays and require 3 times the memory of maintaining an array with all 4 dimensions.p  pAm I thinking about this in the right way  What is the proper solution to this problemp  pThe end goal is to have an application that displays the data as close to realtime as possible.p  pstrongEditstrong Would it be possible to continue plotting the points one by one as they come in, and when I need to resize the screen grab an image of the screen and then display a resized version of that imagep

Negative 5029 pIm new to the Windows world, and I think Im getting lost in the weeds on a problem. Id love some advice from people with experience with CCLI and WPF and XAML.p  pI have some win32 code, and I need to run a WPF GUI. I found a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa970266.aspxthis MS walkthrough sample, which uses CCLIa. I adapted it to my purposes, and it works great.p  pNext, I wanted to rip out the programmatic WPF stuff and use XAML instead. This is so I can hand off the XAML to a designer person and take myself out of the UI design loop, where I most assuredly dont belong. After reading the WPF Interoperation Projects section of a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms742522.aspxWPF and Win32 Interoperation on MSDNa, I decided to go with the codeXamlReaderLoadcode option and load uncompiled XAML at runtime. My XAML markup is a codeCanvascode codeUIElementcode which I programmatically add as a child of my root codeGridcode CCLI element. This works great.p  pNow I want to add event handler to controls in the XAML. This is where I have started to run into trouble. Im sure that my general ignorance of the Windows world is 95 of whats killing me here.p  pI started with a hrefhttpblogs.windowsclient.netrobrelyeaarchive20090603xamleventsincompiledanduncompiledscenarios.aspxRob Relyeas page outlining the various XAMLandeventhandler optionsa.p  pI decided to try compiling the XAML as a C DLL. Its basically the same XAML as what I used in the runtime Load case. I instantiate the object and programmatically add as it as a child, just like before. But ... I get nothing but a black window. No exceptions get thrown either. Im baffled.p  pMy question is, am I even headed down the right path The page on XAMLandeventhandlers says you can use event handlers defined in uncompiled XAML in .Net Framework 4. Should I bite the bullet and just go to VS 2010 Im presently on VS 2008 so I can use .Net Framework 4 and just stick with uncompiled XAML Are there any gotchas with doing things that way p  pOr, if you do think the compiled C DLL is a reasonable path, do you have any ideas on how I can debug the problems Im havingp  pOr, is there a better and completely different approachp  pThanks in advance for your advice.p  pPollyp

Negative 5029 pIve got a question about accidentally hiding abstract methods.p  pIm creating a basic Entity class as an interface from which to create all other entities in the game Im working on.p  pFrom this Entity class, I have created several derived classes. There are things like MovingEntity, Trigger, Door, etc... Many of these children classes also have children derived from them. For example, MovingEntity has classes like Projectile and EnemyUnit as children.p  pIn my base Entity class, I have methods like Update and Render that are abstract, because I want every entity to implement these methods. p  pOnce I get down to the second level, however, thats where I hit my questionproblem. Ill use the Trigger class, for example. Trigger derives from the base Entity class, but Trigger still has its own children like TriggerRespawning and TriggerLimitedLifetime. I dont want to instantiate a Trigger object, so I can keep that class abstract  I will only create objects from Triggers children classes. But what do I do with the abstract methods that Trigger is supposed to implement from Entityp  pI thought I could just basically use the same code in Trigger as I did in Entity. Declare the same method, same name, same parameters, and just call it abstract. Then, Triggers children would be forced to implement the actual functions. p  pThis didnt work, however, because in the Trigger class, my build errors say that I am hiding the abstract methods from the base Entity class.p  pHow can I pass down the idea of forcing the eventual children to implement these abstract methods without making all of the parents inbetween implement them Do I need to use virtual on the first round of children classes p  pI havent been able to find a good answer on this so far, so I decided to break down and ask. Thanks in advance, guys. p

Negative 5029 pI am working with AndEngine for an app project and I have hit a major snag in regards to my frame rate.  I have a few decently sized sprites to place on the screen, each being 512x768, and it seems that each one of these I add takes a very noticeable chunk of my FPS away.  p  pEven if the image being used is nothing but a blank PNG, there is an equivalent amount of loss.  I have searched around and tried everything that made sense, but nothing seems to have improved it at all, and the lack of documentation for AndEngine doesnt simplify matters any.  p  pMy only real guess at the reason is that the sprites must be entirely recreating themselves every call.  I could be entirely wrong, but its the only logical reason I can think of.  Despite that, I am not sure how to stop this from happening Still assuming it is the problem at all of course.  p  pThe code I am using to create everything is the same as every example Ive seen, so I doubt that is the problem, but just in case my sprites are setup more or less like the following p  precode        public void onLoadResources             this.mTexAtlas  new BitmapTextureAtlas1024, 1024, TextureOptions.BILINEARPREMULTIPLYALPHA             this.mTexBottom  BitmapTextureAtlasTextureRegionFactory.createFromAssetthis.mTexAtlas, this, bottom.png, 0, 0             this.getEngine.getTextureManager.loadTexturethis.mTexAtlas                   public Scene onLoadScene             mTexBottom  new SpritespriteX, spriteY, spriteWidth, spriteHeight, mTexAtlas             scene.attachChildmTexBottom, childCount          codepre  pIts not my exact code, for clarity reasons, but that is how all of the examples I have seen look, so thats pretty much how mine looks.  Oh, and the texture atlas is 1024 wide because I am putting two images on each, at least for right now.p  pAt this point I am willing to try anything to get it going a little better, so any ideas at all would be great.p

Negative 5029 pIm writing a function that takes a prospective filename and validates it in order to ensure that no system disallowed characters are in the filename. These are the disallowed characters       lt p  pI could obviously just use string.indexOf to search for each special char one by one, but thats a lot longer than it would be to just use string.search using a regular expression to find any of those characters in the filename.p  pThe problem is that most of these characters are considered to be part of describing a regular expression, so Im unsure how to include those characters as actually being part of the regex itself. For example, the  character in a Javascript regex tells Javascript that it is the beginning or end of the regex. How would one write a JS regex that functionally behaves like so filename.search OR  OR  OR  OR  OR  OR lt OR p
Negative 5029 pWhat would be the best solution for creating method that would take string containing HTML and would chop off the last lets say 10 of the string but without breaking any HTML tags. p  pThe body and header tags are not part of the HTML string.p  pAlso the rounding should happen upwards so lats say that if the last 10 would shrink to 5 if HTML should remain in untouched than the methods should rather cut the begging of HTML and perform 15 cut which would be the begging of the tag. p  pIm thinking of using a hrefhttpjsoup.org relnofollowJsoupa for this. The problem is that the string might not be enclosed by HTML elements. It just might be a text with couple of links in it.p
Negative 5029 pI am rewriting an app that was using the core graphics library because it is extremely slow in iOS 4 and above. I am converting a lot of the code using the Core Animation library instead specifically CALayer. The way I am doing it involves adding sublayers to a root layer. The problem is that it is a drawing program so it ends up with a lot of sublayers very quickly, and after about 20 it starts losing a lot of performance. I am trying to find a way to merge sublayers into one another or merge the sublayers into some background image. It would also be ideal if your suggestions minimized the use of the Core Graphics library unless their performance wasnt impacted in iOS 4 and above. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 5029 pI have an encoding problem in Eclipse Indigo Service Release 1. Heres what happensp  pI have a property file language bundle in German language and it is not displayed correctly when I open it in codeEclipsecode. For instance codegelschtcode is displayed as codegelschtcode. I have tried changing the File Association to codeText Editorcode, codeProperties File Editorcode, codeJBoss Tools Properties Editorcode but it is shown like this in all cases.p  pThe interesting part is that when I open the file in codeNotepadcode it is displayed correctly. In codeEclipsecode, the text file encoding is set to codeUTF8code, and the encoding of the file according to codeNotepadcode is ANSI.p  pIs there another setting I do not know about How can I fix this problem to see the correct encoding in codeEclipsecodep

Negative 5029 pI need a macro to help me with data entry in Excel. Basically I want codesheet 1code for data entry, and codesheet 2code for the data that are entered. codeSheet 1code will only have one row for data entry, and once that row is filled you hit enter. The row is automatically added to the table in codesheet 2code, and the row is cleared on codesheet 1code. Now you are ready to enter another entry in codesheet 2code.p  pSo to summarize codesheet 2code will have multiple rows for the data entered, and codesheet 1code will only have 1 row because it automatically clears its row after each entry. p  pIs something like this possible If you guys can post some code for me it would really help, and keep in mind I have never programmed in VBA before.

Negative 5029 pI have started playing around with Apache camel recently. So being the experimental type I thought I would create a simple project that would scan a file directory every couple of seconds to see if I have a new file pick that file up and then copy it to another folder. Later on I want to place these files into a database.p  pSo keeping with the basics first I created a route such as the followingp  precode fromfilecCTestinboxnooptrue                 .tofileCCtestoutbox codepre  pThis worked and I thought ok lets add a timer. Initially I made the mistake of using a timer and trying thisp  precodefromtimermyTimerperiod50.tofilecCTestinboxnooptrue                 .tofileCCtestoutbox codepre  pI then had some strange exception about not being able to write a file. I then realised by placing the file route after the timer route it became a producer. So I researched a bit and here is where I am little confused.p  pSo from my understanding the file component uses the scheduled poll pattern. There is even a pollStrategy option in the file route url pattern. There is also a Polling Consumer EIP. p  pSo here is where my confusion sets in.p  p1 If the file component uses the scheduled poll pattern does it useimplement the polling conumser EIPp  p2 How do I add a simple schedule to the file component to consume files say every 30 secondsp  p3 How do I create my own pollingStrategy by implementing org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollStrategyp  pI suspect I can do something like thisp  precode    fromfilecCTestinboxnooptrueamppollStrategysomeexpression                 .tofileCCtestoutbox codepre  pI have tried to get some examples around this but I am either not looking at the right places or missing the plot completely. I guess this is not so much a code related question but more of a what is the best strategypattern for this approach.p  pThanks Namphibianp

Negative 5029 pOk, so I have this issue where I need to get access to the headersfooters displayed in a UITableView.  Moreover, I need to do this from a subclass of UITableView so I cant simply assign tags to the view from the UITableView Delegate.  UITableView does keep an array of visible headers and footers but it provides no access to those arrays even to the subclass, which I personally think is asinine.p  pI need this so that I can provide a custom dragndrop insertionmove user interface.  Im trying to get it to work almost exactly like Apples own rearranging interface, but of course, with my own custom implementation like the ability to drag from another table. Everything works perfectly except for the headersfooters.  p  pAt the moment Im trying to hack it by iterating through all the subviews of UITableView.  Im pretty sure that the only subviews of UITableView is backgroundView, UITableViewCells, and HeadersFooters. So I just need to determine which are UITableViewCells very easy, which is the background view also easy and which are headersfooters not so easy.  Im pretty sure I can do it this way but its definitely a hack and Id rather find a better way if possible.p  pemstrongUPDATEemstrongp  pIm overriding the code void setDelegateidltUITableViewDelegategtdelegatecode method and checking to see if the delegate responds to the appropriate selectors to generate headersfooters and set BOOLs appropriately.  This is making it a lot easier to determine what a particular subview is since the progression of header  cells  footer is predictable.p

Negative 5029 pIm using a custom dynamic class object in a PropertyGrid too much code to post here.  In a nutshell, what it does is allow me to create properties at runtime from arbitrary input in this case XML but thats beside the point. These properties may be any type, including another custom class so they can be nested indefinitely.p  pThe issue Im having is that the PropertyGrid sees this class as a Collection, and has the button in the Value column that allows you to open the CollectionEditor. This among other things has Add and Remove buttons, both of which will fundamentally break the custom class. Rather than try and make these two complicated systems work together nicely, Id rather simply disable the CollectionEditor altogether. I have another system which allows you to see the child objects of the class by setting the PropertyGrid.SelectedObject to the child object and it works fine. Id prefer the user not even having the option of seeing the CollectionEditor, as it seems to be not at all compatible with this system.p  pIdeally, Id like to just put a button in the Value column that I could capture a clickevent and handle myself, but thats optional. I also dont care if I disable the CollectionEditor for just the rows in question or for the whole PropertyGrid. Im not using it either way, so anything which just makes it not accessible would be good.p

Here I see that people who like ham sandwiches also like chicken noodle soup and Caesar salads. p  pI want to go from the ham sandwich to either the chicken noodle soup or Caesar salad detail views without animating back to the table view.

Negative 5029 pI am developing a multiplayer board game. which user enters an empty room, and waits for someone else to join so they can start playing. the issue im facing is, when the first play joins the empty room. the room is empty, and his name is being displayed as Michael. when second playerPeter joins the room from another browser Michael will be listed as Player1 and he as player2. but how can I make the browser of Michael of display Peter has joined the room . Im thinking of using jquery setInterval, but I dont find this efficient since it is consistently calling the server. Any suggestions example Michael goes to www.board.comgame1  and waits for someone to join Peter goes to www.board.comgame1 and he joins. in Peters browser he can see Micael in the room. But in MICHAELS browser he cannot see. how can I make michael notified if someone has joined the room  is jQuery setinterval the solution only isnt it unefficientp

Negative 5029 pIm running into a problem in an app that Im developing.

In order to do that I store an NSDictionary of userData in NSUserdefaults and when the login view loads I check if there is data in NSUserdefaults. If there is data I try to segue and the performSegueWithIdentifier method gets called but it just doesnt perform the segue. This is all heppening in the loginViewController.

Negative 5029 pI have users connecting to a Node.js server, and when they join, I add them into a Lobby essentially a queue.  Any time there are 2 users in the lobby, I want them to pair off and be removed from the lobby.  So essentially, its just a simple queue.p  pI started off by trying to implement this with a Lobby.run method, which has an infinite loop started within a codeprocess.nextTickcode call, and any time there are more than two entries in the queue, I remove them form the queue.  However, I found that this was eating all my memory and that infinite loops like this are generally illadvised.p  pIm now assuming that emitting events via codeEventEmittercode is the way to go.  However, my concern is with synchronization.  Lets assuming my Lobby is pretty simplep  precodeLobby     users []  , join function user      this.users.pushuser     emitter.emitlobby.join, user     , leave function user      var index  this.users.indexOfuser     this.users.spliceindex, 1     emitter.emitlobby.leave, user     codepre  pNow essentially I assume I want to watch for users joining the lobby and pair them up, maybe something like thisp  precodeLobby     ...  , run function       emitter.onlobby.join, function user         TODO determine if this.users contains other users,              pair them off, and remove them from the array          codepre  pAs I mentioned, this does not account for synchronization.  Multiple users can join the lobby at the same time, and so the event listener might pair up a single user with multiple other users instead of just one.p  pCan someone with more Node.js experience tell me if I am right to be concerned with this eventbased approach  Any insight for improvement on this approach would be much appreciated.p

Negative 5029 pIve got Varnish 3.0.3 sitting as a loadbalancerstatic cache in front of two web servers. Ive got a CDN set up using Original Pull method.

Negative 5029 pthis is my first post. I hope someone can help me getting started. So Ive been working on image processing for a class project. We started out easy by creating a Haar transform function from scratch, which was pretty straight forward and then applying it to preset pictures such as cameraman.tif. However, that sample picture is on a grayscale and a square matrix. p  pNow we made a big leap and were supposed to apply the filter to any rectangular colored picture. I understand that if I codeimreadpicturecode it will create an array matrix with three values representing red, green and blue RGB. I also understand that principally speaking I have to use a codeforcode loop to go through each channel of color. However, it trips me on how to create it for the different channels and put the image back together. p  pI went through some awesome answers here and was able to reconstruct the woman and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6766210matlabwavelettransformforndimensionmodifiedrq1fruit basket examplea, but unfortunately they all use the preset codeDWTcode function, which I must not. p  pThe final code should go like  1Ask the user how many iterations are desired p  precodepic    inputWhat picture would you like Type 1 for an example or a URL   codepre  p2 Ask the user about the thresholdp  precodet      inputThreshold codepre  p3 Ask the user how many iterations 13p  precodei      inputHow many iterations do you want Choose 13.   codepre  pAs a sample image, I chose a rectangular bitmap, because it hasnt been compressed yet and using 1 as an easy identifierp  precodeif pic 1    A  imread httpreadingeagle.comBlogUploads11Birds20in.bmp else A  imreadpic  end  [m,n]Matrix dimensions, cchannels [m,n,c]size A    plot original imshow A   codepre  pNow we have to perform the Daubchechies Wavelet Transform with however many iterations the user specified while setting the values outside of the Thresholds absolute value to zero.

Negative 5029 pIve got a tablesorter running almost the way I would like it, there is just one more thing that I dont know how to do.p  pRight now, I have table in which you can search in columns and you can quickly filter the table by pressing a button which puts a value in the search field of a column.p  pThe thing is that I would like people to be able to check multiple checkboxes so table will be filtered based on this input. These checkboxes are grouped, each group should filter on his corresponding column eg checking different months should filter the month column. It should be possible to check multiple checkboxes in multiple groups. For example you can check Netherlands, Belgium which filters on the country column AND check August and September which adds filters to the month column. You can check my example website to see what I mean.p  pThe checked boxes should not input their values in the search fields like the buttons do now.p  pAt last, Id like to include a button which clears all the search queries and therefor resetting the table which it already does now but it should also uncheck all the checkboxes.p  pIm not a programmer, but with some basic knowledge, a lot of research and trial and error I managed to got the tablesorter running.

As mentioned earlier, you can see the website and test out the popup issues. I use Google Chrome for testing it out, and if all works well there, I check out the site in other browsers to make it compatible. p  pAlso, I think the jumping popup issue is solvable. I saw other tutorials for making modal popups and those work just fine in my mobile browsers, but I cant afford having to recode all those popups. Unless I can edit the existing code and shorten it, while remaining the functionality and without having to edit anything in index.php. Anyway... Please just take a look at it. It might be easier to just meddle with it inbrowser, inspecting the elements and such... Its quite a lot of code.p  pAny help is GREATLY appreciatedp

Negative 5029 pSo Im creating a Wordpress site where I have these two plugins installed a hrefhttpwww.advancedcustomfields.com relnofollowAdvanced Custom Fieldsa and a hrefhttpwpml.org relnofollowWPMLa. In the custom fields plugin I have Repeater Fields addon installed. p  pOn the Frontpage the Repeater Field addon is used for three different sliders, and there have been added a whole lot of images for one of the sliders and max 10 for the two others. So there is a lot of content for that single page. There is no problem saving that page though. And I can access the page again, add a new image for one of the sliders without any problem. But when i create a dublicate for another language using WPML and save it. Then I can update the page with extra content afterwards. It says that the page has been updated, but the new content, which I applied, isnt there anymore.br  So I thought that this might be because of some limit. So i changed the codemaxinputvarscode and codemaxvarscode in my code.htaccesscode file with the followingp  blockquote   pphpvalue suhosin.post.maxvars 10000br    phpvalue suhosin.get.maxvars 10000br    phpvalue suhosin.request.maxvars 10000br    phpvalue maxinputvars 10000p blockquote  pBut this doesnt change anything.

Negative 5029 pIm in the process of building a D3 layer in Google maps. Im at the stage where D3 renders fine, but mouse events that I want to affect this layer are caught by I think the overlayMouseTarget layer. This means I cant have any interaction with my D3 layer.p  pIve searched here and elsewhere for fixes, however after implementing several suggestions I found I am still left without a working solution. Are there any supported methods for either overloading mouse interactions or removinghiding the mouse interaction layer in Google Maps Or perhaps there is a more elegant solutionp  pI could do something like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5838868googlemapsapiv3passingvaluestolistnerfunctionsoastomakeacirclGoogle Maps API v3  Passing values to Listner function, so as to make a circle when the marker is clicked a and have my D3 code completely divorced from any layer, but Id rather have it in a layer sandwiched below the layer with the zoompan controller and above the mouse event layer. Or figure out how to send events down several layers to where my D3 code currently lives.p  pI used a hrefhttpsgist.github.com899711 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com899711a as a starting point for adding D3 into Maps.p

Negative 5029 pI implemented simple UITableViewController and checked out scrolling of it works well if I make it root view of a UINavigationController.p  pThe problem occurs when I added the table view controller to a container view controller like thisp  precode[self addChildViewControllermyTableViewController] [self.view addSubviewmyTableViewController.tableView] [myTableViewController didMoveToParentViewControllerself] codepre  pThis code works well except the scrolling problem.p  pWhen I try to scroll it, it is dragged slightly and returns to first position. I can even see the table cells below the screen when I drag the table view, but it returns to the original state after I get off my finger.p  pIs there anyone who have been adding UITableViewController to a containerp  pstrongUpdatestrong After some digging, I found that it didnt work because the table view has long enough height.

Negative 5029 pBy default, Maven will grab all the dependencys from the local repository .m2 directory. But instead, I want it to grab the dependencies from another location. Is this even possiblep  pI dont want to do this with everything. I dont want this to happen at the root or the parent level. I want this to happen at a more deeper pom level. There is more than once that is same dependent is being dependent. For each time, I want it to come from a different location. So, one will use the default maven configuration and get it from the .m2 directory, and the other will get it from a specific directory.p  hr  pMY REASONSp  pIn the install phase, everything gets installed to the .m2 directory. In the package phase, I have everything get packaged into a target directory. Am I not correctp  pMy .m2 directory has more than needed. My target has my final project without the extra things that are included in the .m2 directory. Whatever is in the target directory is the final product. When Im in the compile phase, I dont want it to depend upon the .m2 directory, but instead the target since that is my real final project. hr Im using Maven 2.2.1 on Linux Red Hat.p  pIve read somewhere that you can use the codeltscopegtcode element with the value bsystemb under the codeltdependencygtcode element in your codepom.xmlcode file. Then give the actual location in another element called codeltsystemPathgtcode under that codeltdependencygtcode. I dontif this answers my question, or if this something entirely different.p  piI know this goes against Mavens recommendations, but I have my reasons.ip

Negative 5029 pI have created iOS module in Titanium. This module includes my own framework written in native objective c. Everything looks fine, but there is one issue. One of the methods ive ported from my framework through module, takes a UIView and adds to it another uiview as a subview. This subview contains a UIView with a UIButton. Problem is that sometimes subview appeares on the screen but without label on the button, i have to click the button, then the label appeares. But in some situations it depends when i call this method from the module in javascript, subview doesnt appeare at all, but it is actually there because when i tap on the place where it should be, buttons click event handler is being called. I have no idea what is wrong maybe something with layer. When i use my framework in a native ios app, everything is working fine.p  pCould someone help me with thatp

Negative 5029 pIn my application, in one of the pages I have several data ouput and data iteration components. This page contains several popup model panels as well.

When I enter the page, it redirects me to the main page as mentioned. Initially when I enter the page, it works properly. However, when I walk through other pages and come back to the main page I encounter the duplicate Id for a component error.

How do I collect gcov data for long running processes. say, my program is the kernel of an operating system which runs in a server that never shuts down  and I need to collect code coverage data for it. Is there any way to make gcov dump code coverage data periodically say, every 1 hour or upon certain event  how can I trigger gcov dump code coverage data rather than waiting for gcov to do it after the program terminatesp

Negative 5029 pI have to update a big table with over 270 update fields.p  pI am relative new to .NET and need advise what is better to use in this case SqlCommand, some kind of memorymapped table or DataSet or maybe it exists some kind of autogenerated objects using metadata from DB Please help.p  pReason I have an old big Delphi7 application, a part of which is responsible for listening on socket some packets which are marshaled to big structures and, in final step, stored in DB. Now I am porting this part to new C Service and at least actually i have to preserve the same logic.  The problem is that structure is BIG over 220 fields and tables where it is stored have near 300 fields. From my structure of 220 fields are deductedcalculated other 50 fields and all should be update in DB.  Actual Delphi code is ugly ant it grew over several years like table itself, something like this p  precodeUPDATE TABLENAME       MSGTYPE    IntToStrintegerRecvSruct.MSGTYPE         ,SomeFLOATfield    FloatToStrRecvSruct.SomeFLOATfield        ... and other over 270 fileds here WHERE ID    IntToStrobj.ID codepre  pno any dynamic SQL, etc..  Actually I cannot change DB structure.. so that i have to play in code only and I am not sure if it is pertinently to translate code. Table is used for some reports and statistics. Some of calculateddeducted fields have to deal with some constants in sourcecode.p  pused devtools  MS SQL Server 2000, C .net2.0, VS2008p
Negative 5029 pI need to have a button with an image and some text in it, lets call it codeMyButtoncode. The button colour, position of the image, position of the text, size of the image and font size remain the same every time codeMyButtoncode is displayed. However the image source and text will be different every time. Finally, the opacity of the button needs to be set to 0.2 when disabled, and back to 1 when enabled.p  pMy approach so far please correct me if there is a better way is to create a XAML file with code behind that inherits the codeButtoncode class. My XAML is similar top  precodeltButton xClassMyButton xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008 xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006 mcIgnorabled dDesignHeight300 dDesignWidth400gt      ltBlank template for a flat borderless buttongt     ltButton.Templategt         ltControlTemplate TargetTypeButtongt     ltButton.Templategt      ltGrid BackgroundF2F2F2gt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt             ltColumnDefinition WidthAutogt             ltColumnDefinition Widthgt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt          ltImage NameImgControl Width32 Height32 Grid.Column0gt          ltTextBlock NameLabel VerticalAlignmentCenter Grid.Column1gt      ltGridgt ltButtongt codepre  pAnd code behindp  precodePartial Public Class MyButton Inherits Button  Private imgSrc As String Public Property ImageSource As String     Get         Return imgSrc     End Get     Setvalue As String         imgSrc  value         Dim imgUri As New UriimgSrc, UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute         ImgControl.Source  New BitmapImageimgUri     End Set End Property  Public Property ButtonText As String     Get         Return Label.Text     End Get     Setvalue As String         Label.Text  value     End Set End Property End Class codepre  pSo whenever I use it in XAML I only need to declare the button, the ImageSource and the ButtonText properties.p  pThis works fine so far but Im having trouble with setting the opacity when the button is enableddisabled.

Negative 5029 pA typical setup we have a main thread with a codemainMOCcode and a background thread with its own codebackgroundMOCcode. The background thread performs readonly operations on the codebackgroundMOCcode by dispatching blocks to a codebackgroundQueuecode. p  pThe codebackgroundMOCcode needs to merge the changes from the codemainMOCcode so we register for codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode and then do something likep  precode voidmainMocDidSaveNSNotification notification      dispatchasyncbackgroundQueue,          [backgroundMoc mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotificationnotification]       codepre  pLets say the user deletes an object in the codemainMOCcode. The code above does not seem safe to me, since the merge will be done at some point in the future. Until the merge is done, there might still be blocks on the codebackgroundQueuecode that are trying to use the deleted object.p  pThe obvious solution would be to use codedispatchsynccode instead or codeperformBlockAndWaitcode, codeperformSelectorOnThread...code instead. From the code snippets I see on the interwebs, this seems to be what everybody is doing. But Im not comfortable with this solution either.p  pThe name codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode implies that the save has already happened when the notification is delivered. So the corresponding row has already been deleted from the underlying database assuming an sqlite store. codedispatchsynccode will have to wait for other blocks on the queue to finish before it can merge the changes, and these other blocks could still try to work with the deleted object, leading to an codeNSObjectInaccessibleExceptioncode.p  pIt seems to me that the correct way to merge changes from one threadqueue to another would be top  ol liSubscribe to codeNSManagedObjectContextWillSaveNotificationcode and codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode on the background thread. li liOn codeNSManagedObjectContextWillSaveNotificationcode empty the codebackgroundQueuecode and suspend any operations that dispatch new blocks to the queue.li liOn codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode merge the changes synchronously.li liResume normal operation on the background queue.li ol  pIs this the correct approach or am I missing somethingp

That makes it easy during development to focus on the module being worked on not having to run a full build and deployment and deploy the full application only in a complete build. pli lipThe setup should allow for multiple distributions based on a selection of modules to be included in the build.

Negative 5029 pI am looking for a document DB supporting Windows XP 32 bits, satisfying the following requirementsp  ul liThe support must not be discontinued. I.e. I want to be able to install the most recent version of the DB. MongoDB does not fit, since they dropped supporting XP and CouchDB does not fit since they dropped supporting any Windows 32 bits.li liIt should be relatively simple. Obviously, the application is not an enterprise one, so a complex DB, like Cassandra, is out. In fact, I would like to avoid column databases, since I think they exist to solve enterprise level problems, which is not the case here. On the other hand, I do not want relational DBs, because I want to avoid DB upgrades each time new fields are added and they will be added.li liIt should support indexing on part of the document, like MongoDB. I could use a relational DB, like hsqldb to store the data as json string. This lets adding new fields easy  no schema needs to be changed. But these fields would not be indexable by the database. Again, unlike MongoDB.li liFinally, the DB will run on the same machine as the application itself  one more down for MongoDB, which would steal all the RAM from the application to itself.li ul  pSo, in a sense, I am looking for something like MongoDB, but with the support of Windows XP 32 bits. p  pAny advicesp  pP.S.p  pI know that Windows XP has one year to live before MS drops supporting it. However, I have to support XP anyway.p

Negative 5029 pIn my WPF application, there is a list to select an item from. The selected item will then be displayed in a ContentControl for further interaction. Depending on the type of the selected item there can be several, an appropriate DataTemplate is used in the ContentControl. So far, this should be nothing unusual for data processing business applications.p  pIn each DataTemplate, there are multiple TextBoxes and other controls that bind their value to a specific property of the ViewModel class. When selecting another item from the list, all of these are updated as expected. The buttons also execute their command on the correct instance of the ViewModel.p  pThere is one context menu item that also executes a command, but this will only work for the first selected item. When another element of the same type is selected from the list, reusing the already loaded template view, the command from the context menu will always be executed on the firstselected item. So the binding is not updated to the correct instance of the ViewModel.p  pThe only way to make the menu item use the correct ViewModel instance is to select an item of a different type so that the template is changed to another view. Only then the context menu is updated correctly.p  pWhy wont the menu item command be updated just like any other binding in the view It is fetched once upon loading but never updated for the views lifetime.p

Negative 5029 pSo Im trying to build an android app which acts as a real time audio analyzer as a precursor to a project that will involve detecting and filtering out certain sounds.p  pSo I think Ive got the basics of discrete Fourier transforms down, however Im not sure what the best parameters should be for doing real time frequency analysis.p  pI get the impression that under ideal situations unlimited computing power, I would take all the samples from the 44100 samplesec PCM stream Im getting from the AudioRecord class and put them through a 44100 element fifo window padded to 216 with 0s and maybe a tapering function , running an FFT on the window every time a new sample came in. This would I think, give me the spectrum for 0  22 KHz updated 44100 times per second.p  pIt seems like this is not going to happen on a smartphone. The thing is, Im not sure which parameters of the computation I should reduce in order to make in order to make it tractable on my Galaxy Nexus while still holding on to as much quality as possible. Eventually I would like to be using an external microphone with better sensitivity.p  pI figure it will involve moving the window more than one sample between taking FFTs, but I have no idea at what point this becomes more detrimental to accuracyaliasingwhatever than just doing the FFT on a smaller window, or if there is a third option Im overlooking.p  pWith the natively implemented KissFFT Im using from libgdx, I seem to be able to do somewhere between 3042 44100 element FFTs per 44100 samples and still have it be responsive meaning that the buffer getting filled from the thread doing AudioRecord.read isnt filling up faster than the thread doing the ffts can drain it. p  pSo my questions arep  ol liCould the performance Im currently getting just be the best Im going to get Or does it seem like I must be something stupid because much faster speeds are possibleli liIs my approach to this at least fundamentally correct or am I barking entirely up the wrong treeli ol  pId be happy to show any of my code if that would help answer my questions, but theres a lot of it so I figured I would do so selectively instead of posting it all.p

Some of them doing requests every few secondsp  pBecause clients pay per request, we need to control if their number of successful requests reach their limit, and as querying postgresql data update the value of hitsCounter field after every request is bad in terms of performance, we are thinking about implementing a cache system with redis.p  pstrongThe ideastrong  After a client does his first request, we retrieve his data from postgresql and store it into redis cache. Then work with this cachedata, for example incrementing the hitsCounter key value, till the client stops doing requests. strongIn parallel, every few minutes a background process persist data from redis cache to db tables, so at the end we have the updated data back to postgresql, and we can deal with them in the future.strongp  pI think it obviously increase performance, but Im not sure about this background process. An option is to check the TTL of the cache elements and if its minor than some value it means client has finished doing requests, persist the data.p  pI would love to hear some opinions about this. Is this a good idea Do you know some better alternativesp

Negative 5029 pTwo weeks ago we migrated our database from a postgres instance hosted on the web server to a mysql instance hosted on Amazon RDS.  p  pAfter the migration, we started experiencing Lost connection during query errors on about 0.5 of requests, causing the web request to fail.  Prior to the migration when we were on Postgres, we had never seen this issue before.p  pThere is a lot of documentation on the Lost connection during query error from mysql as well as other communities online.  The issue is not reproducible in dev or staging, only production.  The issue occurs relatively rarely in production but seems to occur much more frequently when hitting a fairly complex page in ActiveAdmin that runs a number of queries on one page an admin dashboard.  p  pHere is the list of things Ive tried thus far to no availp  p1 waittimeout variable  this doesnt seem applicable as it isnt related to connection pool connections dying after 8 hours.  I can restart the database and rails app and reproduce the issue within 50 requests by hitting the active admin dashboard page.  That said, Ive increased the waittimeout on mysql and rebooted the Amazon RDS instance to no avail.p  p2 reconnect  true in database.yml.  I suspect this helps mask the issue as Abortedclients grows sometimes without corresponding failures on the rails frontend, I assume because connection pool retries the connection on failures in some cases and gracefully recovers.p  p3 disabled delayedjob  thinking perhaps delayed job was corrupting entries, I disabled it and reproduced the issue again.p  p4 Upgrade Amazon RDS instance from small to medium  the DB is under very light load but thought this may be a factor so I upgraded the Amazon RDS instance from small to medium with no luck.p  p5 Simplifying the queries on the dashboard page have made that page less likely to reproduce the error, but hasnt eliminated the error entirely.p  p6 In instances where the error occurs, the error occurs immediately  not after a period of 35 seconds, leading me to believe it isnt a readwriteconnection timeout.p  p7 Rebooting EC2 web server doesnt helpp  p8 Rebooting Amazon RDS database instance doesnt helpp  p9 Neither the web server nor the Amazon RDS instance are under any significant loadp  p10 Both web server and RDS DB instance are in the same availability zonep  pI feel like the connection pool entries in Rails may be getting left in a bad state by a prior query, causing the next attempt on that connection to fail immediately, but have no way to prove that.p  pI also see that Rails 4.0 has a new Reaper concept that seems to check the pool entries on a regular basis for dead connections  leading me to think maybe this is a wider spread problem that they are now fixing in Rails 4.0.  p  pBecause this is only reproducible in our production environment at this point, I cannot move the mysql instance off of RDS to the web server to isolate it being RDS remote DB instance or not.p  pThoughts from the Stack Overflow community on what to try nextp

The error handling part will be more complicated, but always the same at every type, thats why I dont want to write them down multiple times. The parameters can vary freely just as sql string as an inputs.p  pMy problem now, that I cannot write a generic Dapper query surrounding my own code, but with a specific injected function from outside of this wanted method.p  pIs this possible in C Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.p

However, I do not know beforehand exactly what the width of the column should be  it could be anything.p  precodetheTableViewer  new TableViewercomp, SWT.MULTI  SWT.BORDER  SWT.FULLSELECTION GridData theTableGridData  new GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, true theTableViewer.getTable.setLayoutDatatheTableGridData TableLayout layout  new TableLayout layout.addColumnDatanew ColumnWeightData100, true layout.addColumnDatanew ColumnWeightData100, true layout.addColumnDatanew ColumnWeightData100, true layout.addColumnDatanew ColumnWeightData100, true codepre  pDoes anyone know how to get the TableViewer to automatically size up its columns properly to include everythingp

Im making an app that retrieves data from an API, makes some charts from these data probably using d3.js and then renders these charts and some dynamic text on a PDF template, generating a PDF doc that can then be downloaded by the user. p  pIm wondering if jsPDF can be used to fill in dynamic data on a preexisting PDF template.

Negative 5029 pI have a CompositeListList partitioned table with 19 Columns and about 400 million rows. Once a week new data is inserted in this table and before the insert I need to set the values of 2 columns to null for specific partitions.p  pObvious approach would be something like the following where COLUMN1 is the partition criteriap  precodeUPDATE BLABLATABLE  SET COLUMN18  NULL, SET COLUMN19  NULL  WHERE COLUMN1 IN VALUE1, VALUE2 codepre  pOf course this would be awfully slow.p  pMy second thought was to use CTAS for every partition that I need to set those two columns to null and then use EXCHANGE PARTITION to update the data in my big table. Unfortunately that wouldnt work because its a CompositePartition.p  pI could use the same approach with subpartitions but then I would have to use CATS about 8000 times and drop those tables afterwards every week. I guess that would not pass the upcoming codereview.p  pMay somebody has another idea how to performantly solve thisp  pPS Im using ORACLE 11g as database. PPS Sorry for my bad English..p
Negative 5029 pI am processing text and have the need to store large sequences of hashable objects  sometimes strings, sometimes tuples of words, etc. Ive been thinking of using the hash function to provide an simple store and retrieve class but with my first approach it is possible that a single hash key might resolve to more than one item. Given that I add a get function that takes the return value of add as an argument I cannot know which item in the list to return.p  precodeclass HashStore     def initself         self.uniques        def addself, bighashable         hashvalue  hashbighashable         if hashvalue not in self.uniques             self.uniques[hashvalue]  [bighashable]         elif bighashable not in self.uniques[hashvalue]             self.uniques[hashvalue].appendbighashable          return hashvalue codepre  pAnother approach ends up assuring that there is only a single mapping for each unique hashable item.p  precodeclass SingleStore     def initself         self.uniques           self.indexed           self.index  0      def addself, bighashable         if bighashable not in self.uniques             self.index  1             self.uniques[bighashable]  self.index             self.indexed[self.index]  bighashable          return self.uniques[bighashable] codepre  pThis works and assures that the return value of add can be used to return a unique value. It just seems a bit clumsy. Is there a better, more Pythonic way of handling this situationp  pIve been ambiguous as to the question. There are two issues  one is that I have millions of objects that are currently using keys ranging from 100s to 1000s of bytes each the bighashable thing. Converting those to integers would enable processing of more data than I currently can. Secondly, keeping only a single canonical copy of each bighashable thing would cut down on memory usage as well, though it is the first issue that is driving my question, because each key is actually a separate copy of the bighashable thing.p

Is this the reason im having issues or are these optional  p  pI will try to get a demo project showing the issues im having asap.p  pAny help or pointers to correctly creating codeUICollectionViewLayoutscode would be great.p  pThanks for reading,br Liamp

Negative 5029 pIm trying to get early fragment culling to work, based on the stencil test. My scenario is the following I have a fragment shader that does a lot of work, but needs to be run only on very few fragments when I render my scene. These fragments can be located pretty much anywhere on the screen I cant use a scissor to quickly filter out these fragments.p  pIn rendering pass 1, I generate a stencil buffer with two possible values. Values will have the following meaning for pass 2p  ul li0 do not do anythingli li1 ok to proceed, eg. enter the fragment shader, and renderli ul  pPass 2 renders the scene properly speaking. The stencil buffer is configured this wayp  precodeglStencilMask1 glStencilFuncGLEQUAL, 1, 1  if the value is NOT 1, please early cull glStencilOpGLKEEP, GLKEEP, GLKEEP  never write to stencil buffer codepre  pNow I run my app. The color of selected pixels is altered based on the stencil value, which means the stencil test works fine.p  pHowever, I should see a huge, spectacular performance boost with early stencil culling... but nothing happens. My guess is that the stencil test either happens after the depth test, or even after the fragment shader has been called. Whyp  pnVidia apparently has a patent on early stencil culling a hrefhttpwww.freepatentsonline.com7184040.html relnofollowhttpwww.freepatentsonline.com7184040.htmla Is this the right away for having it enabledp  pIm using an nVidia GeForce GTS 450 graphics card.

Negative 5029 pI have a bit of a weird problem maybe.p  pI have a server at home which is used for downloading and routing. Since I live in a old house with no network cables the server is hooked up through wifi. But my wireless access point tends to hang, causing my wireless network to stop. This is not a big problem since i use the server only for entertainment purposes and the AP only needs a reboot.p  pThe problem is the fact that the server doesnt try to reconnect to the network automatically. I need to hook up my laptop to the server manually and run remote desktop to reconnect to the network.p  pSo what I need is a piece of software that will keep searching for wireless networks when it is not connected to one. If this doesnt exist I will have to write something myself but I thought first find someone who might know a existing program.p  pCheers Daanp

Negative 5029 pMy experiance with normal archive types for data such as zipgzip7ziplzmaetc.. dont do a good job of image compressionp  pI was wondering if there exists image compression that allow for a very high compression ratio for long term storage, in which the image doesnt need to contain enough data to preview or look at the picture, just ensure that the data is reproducable to a normal jpegpngp  pWhen searching for image compression algorithms, google basically only returns jpeg,png,gif,bitmap. As far as I understand these image types are for compressing images that need to be viewable in their compressed format.

Negative 5029 pSo my goal is to plot some realtime metrics that are stored in a backbone collection. I have a backbone collection that stores metrics, its updated every second when I poll the backend server. My collection has an array of historical metrics and a field mostrecentdata which is the latest data to come from the backend. Every second, mostrecentdata is updated to a different value. I pass a reference of the backbone collection to the function that creates the cubism metrics.p  pWhen the view containing the Cubism.js view is rendered, it should do a historical load of all the data points in the stored in the collection to the horizon chart.

However, when a metric is initialized, I try to load new data which is stored mostrecentdata. This field is updated every second with the API calls, but with each callback, its ONLY plotting the initial data stored in mostrecentdata. I can confirm that mostrecentdata is indeed being updated in the backbone collection itself, but the reference being passed to cubism is not being updated at each callback. When I log mostrecentdata in the cubism code, it never updates to the latest value.  p  pIs this a closure issue Am I missing some cubism syntax for polling new data Or would I need to pass in the backbone collection reference differently Any hints would be very helpful.

Negative 5029 pOverriding may not be the best term to use here, but Ill explain.p  pFor my applications, I start with a Core library. This is where the app is, source files, assets, layouts, etc. Then, for each market Google, Amazon, BlackBerry, etc, I create a new project, and have it depend on the core library. This allows me to have one base code to work on, without having to duplicate changes to all the other market versions.p  pI put things like market links in a resource file, which I simply override by putting the same value in the res directory of the chosen project.p  pI was hoping the be able to do the same thing with source files, but I get the multiple dex files error.p  pIm trying to base my free version off the same core library. I have two versions to do, each with different ad providers Google, and Amazon. I dont want to have to have the two ad libraries in the core library. My idea was to have a CustomAd class in the core library which is basically blank, and doesnt do anything. Then, in the projects that need ads, place a new CustomAd class, overriding the original in the core library. Is this possible at allp

Negative 5029 pIm currently working on a webbased height map generator with Three.js. I use one canvas to show the actual generated height map, several others for displaying the separate octaves the height map consists of and another one for demonstrating the height map in action where it is applied directly to a plane mesh.p  pSo far so good. The whole stuff also renders perfectly fine with all the predefined parameters wavelength, etc.. The actual problem is, that the canvasses arent updating after the initial render pass which makes my program completely useless since the purpose of my program is to be able to manipulate the several parameters of the height map with sliders and see the effects in real time.p  pSadly the only canvas that updates at all is the one with the real 3D scene with the plane mesh. But also here it kind of seems like the data from the first render pass never got cleared, but at least it seems the uniforms for the noise parameters are updated correctly  this is obviously not the case for all the other canvasses.p  pBefore I finally render a scene, I always set the codeneedsUpdatecode field of the meshes material to codetruecode, but it only seems to work for that one canvas that got initialized last. Im completely lost here and also wasnt able to find any information about that issue.p
Negative 5029 pThis is easier with a diagram. a hrefhttpdbmaths.nuxit.netCaRMetalCaRMetala, attackp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxuJhq.png altThe problemp  pI have two 2D line segments, codePcode and codeQcode. I want to find the point codePxcode on codePcode, and codeQxcode on codeQcode, such that codedistPx,Qxcode is minimized. So far so good this is a pretty straightforward task.p  pNow comes the wrinkle. I want to constrain codePxcode and codeQxcode such that the line codePxQxcode containing them must intersect a emthirdem line segment codeCcode. Feel free to assume that none of the original line segments intersect, BTW.p  ol liTheres obviously a case where the unconstrained codePxcode and codeQxcode already happen to satisfy the codeCcode intersection condition. li liTheres also an infeasible case, where codeCcode doesnt even contain the convex hull of codePcode and codeQcode. Those are trivial cases to check for.li liIn other cases, the line codePxQxcode must contain either codeCacode or codeCbcode. This does not seem to reduce cleanly to a system of linear equations.li liAnd in a final set of cases, codePxQxcode contains not only an endpoint of codeCcode, but an endpoint of codePcode or codeQcode as well. These seem simple to check.li ol  pIts the cases in 3 that Im worried about, because I dont see how to get a nice closed form for it without invoking unpleasantly highdegree polynomials. I could just hurl an iterative constrained optimizer at the whole thing, of course, but Id like to maximize performance, and high accuracy in neardegenerate cases may be important.p

Storing those credentials with codekeyringcode is easy as can be  except that when the cron job actually runs, the credentials cant be retrieved. The script fails out every time. p  pAs nearly as I can tell, this has something to do with the environment cron runs in. I tracked down a set of posts which suggest that the key is having the script export DBUSSESSIONBUSADDRESS.

Negative 5029 pwhat i aim to do is a very simple currency converter. Basically, you type in a number, and press a button, a text is displayed that says x dollars is y euros. Press the button again, a new text is displayed where the old one was, and the old one is displayed under the new one.p  pIve come so far that when something is entered in the field, it pops up below, and if you press the button again with the same or a different value it becomes a list of text.p  pTo clarify what it is im saying here, take a look at this jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netw8KAS5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netw8KAS5ap  pNow i want to make it so that only numbers work, and so that numberx is converted when the button is pressed and displayed below next to some fitting text like x dollars is y eurosp  pThis is my js code, check the jsfiddle full code html, js, cssp  pAny suggestionsp  precodevar count  0  function validate      var amount  document.querySelectoramount     ifamount.value.length gt 0         amount.className  correct         else      amount.className  empty         if document.querySelector.empty      alertNgot r fel         else     addconvertamount.value           function addconvertamount      var table  document.querySelectortbody    var tr  document.createElementtr    var amountTd  document.createElementtd      var amountTextNode  document.createTextNodeamount     amountTd.appendChildamountTextNode    tr.appendChildamountTd     table.insertBeforetr, table.firstChild     count          var button  document.querySelector.button  button.onclick  validate codepre
Negative 5029 pI have an SSIS package that reads data from an Excel source and separates out into invalid data with a reason field or valid data if it passes all my validation checks i.e. duplication checking, valid responses, etc..  The invalid and valid files are Excel destination files.p  pThe package runs as expected on my old laptop connected to the network.  Ive had to change to a new laptop and worked with IT to install all the same SQL Server software.  On the new machine, connected to the same network with the same login credentials in my data sources, the package does not run as expected.p  pI click debug and it looks like its processing as normal and I receive the message, Package execution completed.  Click here to switch to design mode, or select Stop Debugging from the debug menu.  I stop debugging and it looks like all rows were sent to the invalid Excel file as expected.  But when I open the file, its empty.  The valid Excel file is also empty.p  pIm wondering if there is a compatibility issue with the version of Microsoft Excel on this machine  This setup has MS Excel 2013 with some patch that allows accessing 2010 version files.  The old setup had MS Excel 2010.  Im running SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pThanks, Sistop

I wanted to know why this is happening Also, at times, Eclipse are kind of hiding some of my classes, so that they do not appear in the project explorer, although when you create a new class file with the same name of the class that disappeared, it says the class already exists...p  pWhen I refresh KBDF5KBD the package, these problems are sort of solved. But they happen again when I create a new class or when I restart Eclipse. So I wanted a different solution from keep pressing KBDF5KBD everytime...p

It is required that the user fills out all of the text inputs which have a certain pattern of codenamecode attribute value. On form submit, we are using a a jQuery selector to findcount all of the empty inputs those which have an empty codevaluecode attribute so that we can highlight these codeinputcode elements for the user to fill out.

Instead, the application can detected the condition of emwaiting too longem and act appropriately such as alerting the user or trying again after logging.p

Negative 5029 pIn a Python code that iterates over a sequence of 30 problems involving memory and CPUintense numerical computations, I observe that the memory consumption of the Python process grows by 800MB with the beginning of each of the 30 iterations and finally raises an codeMemoryErrorcode in the 8th iteration where the systems memory is in fact exhausted. However, if I codeimport gccode and let codegc.collectcode run after each iteration, then the memory consumption remains constant at 2.5GB and the Python code terminates nicely after solving all 30 problems. The code only uses the data of 2 consecutive problems and there are no reference cycles otherwise the manual garbage collection would also not be able to keep the memory consumption down.p  h2The questionh2  pThis behavior raises the question if Python tries to run the garbage collector before it raises an codeMemoryErrorcode. In my opinion, this would be a perfectly sane thing to do but perhaps there are reasons against thisp  pA similar observation to the above was made here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma43195391219479httpstackoverflow.coma43195391219479ap

Negative 5029 pIn your experience, whats the best way to store a 2dimensional array into a text file My matrix is pretty huge, but lets use a small 3 x 3 matrix as an example.

Negative 5029 pI work on an app that uses location data, and it needs to work in China. Android devices sold here largely dont have Google Play API installed at all and the only way is to root the phone to install it. So Im stuck with LocationManager which works far worse than LocationClient part of Google Play API.p  pMy issue is that LocationManager, when reading from GPSPROVIDER, frequently cannot connect to enough satellites in China and theres occasional significant time gap between fixes. When reading from NETWORKPROVIDER, I can get more frequent fixes, however accuracy ranges from 30 to 500.

But thats only on Nexus4 or some nonChinese Android device.p  pIm asking if anyone know a library that can give better results than straight forward use of LocationManager, or a solution how to use LocationManager to improve resultsp

Negative 5029 pSo heres my issue...p  pI run a set of servers, all running Server 2008 R2. When were doing maintenance on the server we want to display a message to our users telling them the server is under maintenance rather than just Remote Logins Disabled.p  pI found how to set the legal message to display prior to log on, however the problem is that RDP is prompting for credentials before connecting to the server, so the legal message isnt being displayed, and it just takes them straight to Remote Logins Disabled.p  pWhat Im wondering is, is there a way I can change the default login behavior to take the users to a windowsstyled login screen rather than prompting for credentials in the RDP connection window, where the legal notification aka maintenance notification in this case will be displayed before they enter their credentials, similar to server 2003s login behaviorp

Suppose youre implementing a container class with the following semanticsp  ul licodeMyContainerltTgtampcode mutable, readwrite  allows modifying on both the container and its data implementation of the li licodeMyContainerltconst Tgtampcode mutable, readonly   allows modifying to the container but not its datali licodeconst MyContainerltTgtcode immutable, readwrite  allows modifying the data but not the containerli licodeconst MyContainerltconst Tgtcode immutable, readonly  no modifying to the containerdatali ul  pwhere by container modifications I mean operations like addingremoving elements.

However, a bigger problem is that this embrakes the common interfaceem, as we need to eitherp  ul liensure that calling set on an readonly container is a compile errorli liprovide a different semantics for the set method for readonly containersli ul  pOn the other hand, while the Proxybased approach works neatlyp  precodetemplateltclass Tgt class MyContainer     typedef Tamp Proxy  public    Proxy getconst Tamp value, sizet index const    allow on const MyContaineramp      return v[index]   here we dont even need a constcast, thanks to overloading        ...  codepre  pand the common interface and semantics is not broken.p  pOne difficulty I see with the proxy approach is supporting the codeProxyoperatorampcode because there might be no object of type codeTcode stored  a reference to available see notes above. For example, considerp  precodeT ptr  ampx codepre  pwhich cannot be supported unless codexcode is actually stored somewhere either in the class itself or accessible through a chain of methods called on member variables, e.g.p  precodetemplateltclass Tgt Tamp ClassWithProxyProxyoperatoramp    return ampc.getreftox  codepre  pDoes that mean that the proxy object references are actually superior when codeTampcode is available i.e. codexcode is explicitly stored as it allows forp  ul libatchingdelaying updates e.g. imagine the changes are propagated from the proxy class destructorli libetter control over caching li ul  pIn that case, the dilemma is between codevoid setxconst Tamp valuecode and codeTamp xcode.p  pEdit I changed the typos in constness of settersaccessorsp
Negative 5029 pSo, Im trying to make this binary tree program in C and it just keeps throwing the darndest compile errors.  Whenever I change something to find what is causing the error, it changes  I have not forgotten my include guards, I used pragma once.  If I place the struct in the header I get incompatible types, if I put it in the .c I get a redefinition of prettyprint which goes away when I rename prettyprint.  As I trim out the other functions in bintree.c and the header, the error changes to intTree being undefined.  If I then change intTree to just int it becomes incompatible types.  This goes away if I merge the header into the .c. Now its gone.  I think these might be seperate errors and the changing error might be my bad, but it is happening an I have no idea why.  I will present code that demonstrates as many of these, but whenever I try to duplicate what I did it throws a different error.  But Im not frustrated.  I would like to be able to post a wellformatted question with helpful information, but I have none, despite spending several hours on this program.p  pbintree.cxxp  precodeinclude bintree.h  int addintTree root,int key,void val     ifroot         rootmallocsizeofintTree         ifroot             return 1                  rootgtkeykey         rootgtvalval         rootgtleft0         rootgtright0         return 0          ifkeygtrootgtkey         ifrootgtright             return addrootgtright,key,val         else             rootgtrightintTree mallocsizeofintTree             ifrootgtright                 return 1                          rootgtrightgtkeykey             rootgtrightgtvalval             rootgtrightgtleft0             rootgtrightgtright0             return 0                   ifkeyltrootgtkey         ifrootgtleft             return addrootgtleft,key,val         else             rootgtleftmallocsizeofintTree             ifrootgtleft                 return 1                          rootgtleftgtkeykey             rootgtleftgtvalval             rootgtleftgtleft0             rootgtleftgtright0             return 0                   return 2   void getintTree root,int key     ifroot         return 0          ifkeygtrootgtkey         return getrootgtright,key          ifkeyltrootgtkey         return getrootgtleft,key          return rootgtval   int removerootintTree root     ifroot         return 1          ifrootgtright         rootgtkeyrootgtrightgtkey         rootgtvalrootgtrightgtval         return removerootrootgtright          ifrootgtleft         rootgtkeyrootgtleftgtkey         rootgtvalrootgtleftgtval         return removerootrootgtleft          freeroot     return 0   int removenodeintTree root,int key     ifroot         return 1          ifkeygtrootgtkey         return removenoderootgtright,key          ifkeyltrootgtkey         return removenoderootgtleft,key          return removerootroot   void deleteintTree root     ifroot         deleterootgtright         deleterootgtleft         freeroot        void prettyprintintTree root,int ws,int wso,void printvalvoid     ifroot return     printfs,ws,     printvalrootgtval     prettyprintrootgtleft,wswso,wso,printval     prettyprintrootgtright,wswso,wso,printval  codepre  pbintree.hp  precodepragma once  include ltstdlib.hgt  typedef struct intTrees     int key     void val     struct intTrees left     struct intTrees right  intTree  int addintTree,int,void void getintTree,int int removerootintTree int removenodeintTree,int void deleteintTree void prettyprintintTree,int,int,voidvoid codepre  pThese throw hundreds of errors about intTree being an incomplete type.

Negative 5029 pI have a nomenclature question. Suppose you have a drop down selection whose choices depend on the value of a different selection.  For example, the values in a drop down listing car models would depend on the selected make.p  pWhile trying to document an algorithm and when naming variables I cant think of what to call the thing that the dependent properties depend on.  It feels like it should be obvious, but its not coming to me.  Online searches have produced too many unhelpful hits.

Negative 5029 pI was recently reading on a hrefhttpgolang.orgpkgtestingpkgexamples relnofollowtesting and examplesa in the go testing framework and did not really understand what they were for. I see that the documentation saysp  blockquote   pThe package also runs and verifies example code. Example functions may include a concluding line comment that begins with Output and is compared with the standard output of the function when the tests are run. The comparison ignores leading and trailing space.p blockquote  pHowever, I dont really appreciate the reason that this would exist. As I write my tests, it seems that it should be more than clear how to use the code just by reading the unit tests and the benchmarks. What additional motivation does the example section provide It seems redundant to me, however, I am sure that the inventors of go put it for a good reason, specially because they seem to empathizes good programming practice by the design of their language. I hope to understand either their motivation or how this part of language can be used in a positive way in a golang project  p

Negative 5029 pGiven a large project with thousands of tests, some of which take multiple minutes to complete. When executed sequentially, the whole set of test takes more than an hour to finish. The testing time could be reduced by executing tests in parallel. p  pAs far as I know there are no means to do that directly from googletestmock, like a codeasynccode option. Or am I wrongp  pOne solution is to determine the tests which can run in parallel and write a script that starts each in a separate job, i.e.p  precode.test gtestfilterTestSet.test1 amp .test gtestfilterTestSet.test2 amp ... codepre  pBut this would require additional maintenance effort and introduce another layer between the test code and its execution. Id like a more convenient solution. For example, one could suffix the TEST and TESTF macros and introduce TESTASYNC, TESTFASYNC. Tests defined with TESTASYNC would then be executed by independent threads, starting at the same time. p  pHow can this be achieved Or is there another solutionp

Negative 5029 pIn my webform CMS I habitually polyfill all form elements that are not supported using Webshim. p  pThis strategy led to some trouble, because I want to use my own polyfill for a number input that is already being polyfilled by Webshim in some browsers e.g. FF 28.p  pI cannot wrap my head around what I would have to do to prevent Webshim polyfilling that element or what to do to undo the polyfill, or at least it seems as if Im doing it the wrong way.p  pI would prefer undoing the polyfill because thats my current use case, but when I call code.getShadowElementcode on my input, I cannot use code.hidecode and I would also have to do some extra legwork to hide the spin buttons.p  pTo my mind, it should be sufficient that I am calling codewebshim.addShadowDomcode after adding my substitute, since the newer shadowdom should supercede the old, but that does not happen. p  pHeres a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzWW9H8 relnofollowJSfiddlea showing the furthest I got.p

Negative 5029 pI noticed recently while checking a routers log that there were log entries out of sequence. The entries are appended sequencially so it means that the router was changing its date and time during operation, not something that should happen. Obviously this is something I need to check for in future but this is a large router and can produce a LOT of log entries. These rotate and are compressed at the 1Mb mark, and are rotated overall at 11 files. filename.0.gz to filename.9.gz and the current, uncompressed file filename.    p  pI therefor need to check all 11 files for entries that are timestamped out of sequence, a LOT of logs to check. With this amount of logging to check through, obviously the smallest amount of time saved with the overall operation, and the actual script used, could make a huge difference in the running time, and CPU load.    p  pIve got a few dozen routers to check. I was going to pull all the log files back to my Linux server, uncompress them and make them into a single file, and then write a script to check the sequence.p  pWhats the most efficient way to do this pleasep

Negative 5029 pIm a big fan of the Javafx 2 builder notation, however it has been deprecated in Java 8 and I need to replace my old code in a large codebase.  Id like to keep a similar programming style.

I figured there has to be a way to use lambda to accomplish something similar and came up with this.p  precodepublic class FXUtil    public static ltTgt T buildT node, ConsumerltTgt initializer      initializer.acceptnode     return node     codepre  pSo now I can replace my builders like sop  precodeLabel label  FXUtil.buildnew Label, label gt    label.setTextText   label.setStylefxfontsize 20   label.setMinWidth100  codepre  pThis is not quite as nice as the builder or the double brace syntax, but better than nothing.  My question is does this have any drawbacks similar to double brace initialization  The object itself is not an anonymous class, but am I essentially doing the same thing by creating an anonymous class for the lambda  The lambdas should be garbage collected, correct  Do I even need to worry about this now that permgen space is gone in JDK8  Does anyone else have better way of initializing javafx classes besides using FXMLp  pEdit updated example with suggestion from BenjaminGalep

Negative 5029 pIm working on creating convex hulls and triangle meshes from models loaded in with SharpDX 2.6.p  pIve found some example code for extracting the vertices and indices from a model, but theyre based around XNA and what appears to be DirectX 9  my program is using SharpDX with DirectX 11 and SharpDX toolkit, so a lot of things are similar to XNA.p  pThe code Ive found to extract vertices and indices as trianglesp  precodepublic void ExtractDataListltJVectorgt vertices, ListltJOctree.TriangleVertexIndicesgt indices, Model model              Matrix[] bones  new Matrix[model.Bones.Count]         model.CopyAbsoluteBoneTransformsTobones         foreach ModelMesh mm in model.Meshes                      Matrix xform  bones[mm.ParentBone.Index]             foreach ModelMeshPart mmp in mm.MeshParts                              int offset  vertices.Count                 Vector3[] a  new Vector3[mmp.NumVertices]                 mm.VertexBuffer.GetDataltVector3gtmmp.StreamOffset  mmp.BaseVertex  mmp.VertexStride,                     a, 0, mmp.NumVertices, mmp.VertexStride                 for int i  0 i  a.Length i                     Vector3.Transformref a[i], ref xform, out a[i]                  for int i  0 i lt a.Length i vertices.Addnew JVectora[i].X, a[i].Y, a[i].Z                  if mm.IndexBuffer.IndexElementSize  IndexElementSize.SixteenBits                     throw new Exception                         String.FormatModel uses 32bit indices, which are not supported.                 short[] s  new short[mmp.PrimitiveCount  3]                 mm.IndexBuffer.GetDataltshortgtmmp.StartIndex  2, s, 0, mmp.PrimitiveCount  3                 JOctree.TriangleVertexIndices[] tvi  new JOctree.TriangleVertexIndices[mmp.PrimitiveCount]                 for int i  0 i  tvi.Length i                                      tvi[i].I0  s[i  3  2]  offset                     tvi[i].I1  s[i  3  1]  offset                     tvi[i].I2  s[i  3  0]  offset                                  indices.AddRangetvi                            codepre  pHeres what Ive been able to rework it into for DirectX 11 with SharpDX toolkit ease Ive generalised it into simply building an octree from a model, but the main chunk of the pipeline is still the same.p  precode    public static Octree BuildOctreeModel model           ListltJVectorgt vertices  new ListltJVectorgt         ListltTriangleVertexIndicesgt indices  new ListltTriangleVertexIndicesgt                    Matrix[] bones  new Matrix[model.Bones.Count]         model.CopyAbsoluteBoneTransformsTobones             foreach ModelMesh modelMesh in model.Meshes                                     JMatrix boneTransform  PhysicsSystem.toJMatrixbones[modelMesh.ParentBone.Index]             foreach ModelMeshPart meshPart in modelMesh.MeshParts                              int offset  vertices.Count                               var meshVertices  meshPart.VertexBuffer.Resource.Buffer.GetDataltJVectorgt                 for int i  0 i lt meshVertices.Length i                                      JVector.Transformref meshVertices[i], ref boneTransform, out meshVertices[i]                                  vertices.AddRangemeshVertices     append transformed vertices                  var indexElements  meshPart.IndexBuffer.Resource.GetDataltshortgt  this is dangerous if the model uses larger integers                   Each TriangleVertexIndices holds the indices that constitute a triangle primitive                 TriangleVertexIndices[] tvi  new TriangleVertexIndices[indexElements.Length]                 for int i  0 i lt tvi.Length  2 i  3                      tvi[i].I0  indexElements[i  0]  offset                     tvi[i].I1  indexElements[i  1]  offset                     tvi[i].I2  indexElements[i  2]  offset                                  indices.AddRangetvi   append triangles                                          Octree ot  new Octreevertices, indices         ot.BuildOctree  already happens in Octree constructor         return ot      codepre  pIm using a variant of this code without the triangle calculations, just vertices to create a convex hull shape in a similar manner.p  pMy questions are Is there any way I could improve this codep  pIs this code correctare there things that you immediately see as potentially wrongp  pWhen I use this method to extract vertices from a model of a box same one used in the Jitter tutorials, I get a representation thats not quite a box with not quite evenly distributed shape mesh detail which then slows down the collisions much more than using the built in BoxShape primitive 60fps flat when using BoxShape, 2030 when using a single box colliding with a static TerrainShape. Why might this be the casep  pI feel that, while my rewriting of the code produces some output, it doesnt feel optimal at all.p

Negative 5029 pI have no idea how to solve a problem Im running into, and I realize this will be hard for anyone to help me with, but Im hoping that perhaps someone has experienced something similar and can at least point me in the right direction.p  pI have a web app that I built and my wife and I have been using it this whole year without any issues.  Then all of a sudden about a month ago, I started getting JSON parse errors only on the mobile version of the site.  I havent done any work on the site for a while so no code has changed.p  pThe weird thing is that the mobile version will stop working, but you can still use the desktop version without issue.  Then randomly after some amount of time has passed, the mobile version will start working again like nothing happened.   This happens on iOS and Android devices.p  pThe app has a mobile version that uses something like this to detect mobile usersp  precodeuseragentSERVER[HTTPUSERAGENT]  ifpregmatchstuff to match  headerLocation httpexample.commobile.php codepre  pWhen the issues are happening, it will place random numbersletters on the page. I have a screen shot, but it wont let me post it because I dont have enough rep.  In the screen shot, there are  2 drop down menus, one for the month and one for the year.  To the left of the first drop down, it randomly put in 3e8, and to the left of the second drop down it put 94.  If I refresh the page, it will put different numbers and seems to get more messed up the more I refresh.  It will eventually start putting random numbersletters in the drop down menus themselves.  Im using a theme that has different skins, and it will even randomly switch the skin as well sometimes.p  pHas anyone ever experienced something similar before  Could it have something to do with the PHP version  While trying to research this issue, I found that I didnt have a PHP version set on the server, so I set that to 5.5, but that didnt resolve the issue.  p

However, Im rather sure this is wrong  the code usually segfaults. p  pI tried fixing the problem by changing codeif maxmatch  ncode to a looser constraint, like codeif maxmatch gt n1code, so that the algorithm is content with a subperfect matching. This works sometimes, and when it does, it creates some mutual pairs like I wanted, but some vertices are left unpaired. And there are still segmentation faults.p  pSo, is there any way to fix this problem Are there other more suitable algorithms for thisp

Negative 5029 pIve recently added another server to my app and placed an Nginx load balancer in front of them. So a load balancer, and two servers running the same app. This is all very new to me, and Im running into issues I wouldnt have in a single server environment. One of them is that the server side observers on the app run on BOTH servers, which is undesirable. For example, Ill have the following observer.p  precode                var initializing  true                 Jobs.find                     or [                         processed                              ne true                                              ,                          restart true                     ]                 .observeChanges                     added functionid, doc                          if initializing                               do stuff                                                                                initializing  false codepre  pWhich then runs on both servers. I only want it to run on one  I dont care which one, but I guess the one that the user is currently on makes sense. What are some of my options I wouldnt think this is an uncommon scenario but I wasnt able to find anything online. My current workaround is to remove the observers off the servers, and have a THIRD server that does all of the observing. However, this wont scale if my app takes off, which obviously I hope it does. Thanks for any help.p

Negative 5029 pIm stuck on this issue and cannot figure out what it is I am doing wrong. Im in the process of writing a macro to loop through visible fields in a pivot table, find the items in those fields that are filtered, and then apply those filters to the source data table. The particular problem Im having deals with a loop that is supposed to look in a field, find the visible pivot items, and then store those items as variables. Ive been messing around with trying to terminate the loop if all pivot items are visible. Below is what I have so farp  precodeSub PivotTest2 Dim pi As PivotItem Dim count As Integer Dim available As Integer Dim row As Integer   available  ActiveSheet.PivotTablesCities.PivotFieldsCity.PivotItems.count row  2 This is your starting row for display       For Each pi In ActiveSheet.PivotTablesCities.PivotFieldsCity.PivotItems         If pi.Visible Then         count  count  1         End If         If count  available Then             MsgBox All Pivot Items Are Selected         End If         If count ltgt available Then             row  row  1         RangeSheet4G amp row  pi.Name         End If     Next pi End Sub codepre  pSo whenever I have a filter on a city, or group of cities, the macro pastes them to a range in the spreadsheet. Eventually, I want to store them as variables, but for now Im just pasting them for the purposes of working through the code. You can also see that when the number of visible items is equal to the total number of pivot items in that field, Im returning a message box. Eventually, that message box will go away and be replaced by code that tells it to start looking through pivot items in the next visible field.p  pI realize that this might be unnecessary, as applying all visible items as filters to the source data field would result in all items being shown, which accomplishes the same thing. However, Im more curious about what it is Im doing wrong at this point. The code pastes all items to the range, regardless of whether there is a filter or not. However, the message box only returns when there is no filter applied, so it appears to be working correctly.p  pAny inputfeedback would be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 5029 pI am attempting to set up a basic site which calls content into a specific section of one page from the same section of another page and updates the url without reloading common elements. p  pI have been cribbing off of the a hrefhttpcsstricks.comrethinkingdynamicpagereplacingcontent relnofollowCSSTricks examplea updated early last year and it works fine as a singlelevel navigation, but what I want to do is call a secondary navigation into the dynamic content area, which will then link to child pages. So the secondary nav is calling new content into the same section it is currently occupying. p  pThe problem is that the secondary nav breaks the script every other time it is clicked, causing a full page reload. Not every time, every OTHER time. I would guess there is some condition which is toggling between true and false each time the secondary nav is activated but my js skills are lacking and my usual method of fiddling with the code until it somehow works hasnt panned out.p  pIf anyone has any insight into why this is happening and how to fix it, it would be very much appreciated.

Negative 5029 pI have been wondering how to setup intellisense comments for Visual Studio minimum version 2013 and have been having trouble.

A way of working around this is just adding the variables to the Shared stronginitstrong method, which would initialize the variables for every class that called Shared.  It doesnt seem to be the best method, though.p  pWhat I want is the following situation.  If I were to call class B, i.e.p  precodefrom ExampleFile import B test  Bhello, there codepre  pThen this would initialize 4 variables  self.sharedvar1, self.sharedvar2, self.bvariable1, and self.bvariable2.p  pIf I were to call class A, i.e.p  precodefrom ExampleFile import A test  A1, 2 codepre  pThen this would initialize 4 variables  self.sharedvar1, self.sharedvar2, self.avariable1, and self.avariable2.p  pSo with that being said, if I have a class inheriting a class that has an stronginitstrong method, how can I initialize new variables pertaining to only the class that is doing the inheritingp  pIm using Python 2.7.p

Negative 5029 pLong story short, I am trying to process some arrays for various things.  during debugging, I need to print the arrays.  Id like to have just one function that will print whatever array is passed to it.  I can fairly easily pass the dimensions of the array as well.  Lets assume for now, Im only using a twodimensional array.br Believe me I have reviewed every similar question asked here and attempted to implement the suggested solutions to no avail.  I have tried using pointer and the like.  In particular, I tried all four solutions in this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma175695784641918httpstackoverflow.coma175695784641918a, and I still get a myriad of errors depending on the method.

Negative 5029 pI have a project in which its activities and functions follows a sequential process, most of the time. But sometimes you need to go back your steps and rerun the previous functions.p  pI made a state diagram to see how complex it would be.p  pThe first approach I thought was applying the State pattern but the number of states did not seem feasible. Then I separated and classified it functions in 6 processes. A grades traits each process what I imagined something like thisp  precodeTProcessXXX  classTProcess private  atributos privados, etc..  public  funciones y actividades  procedure DoActivity1 procedure DoActivity2  ...  function DoActivityN TResultProcess end codepre  pMost of the activities they of the each Process operate on the same class that encapsulates the data structure needed. And my intention is that each Process can notify has ended for another process then the next job.p  pThe design Ive seen is the Mediator pattern, and have a class that encapsulates the state diagram and enable to each process. To coordinate among themselves I considered add methods to communicate with the coordinatormediator class. Includingp  precodefunction TProcess.RequestPermission boolean  procedure TProcess.NotifyFinishOperationResult TResultOperation codepre  pIn the process I designed them with some independence.p  pAs for being not asking permission for each activity and for some need some redundant sequencing and ask again and again, I applied a lock that allows enable them.p  precodeTProcessXXX.PrepareToWork var req boolean begin     req  RequestPermission     then begin if req EnableActivitys Work end end codepre  pSo far so good. My doubts began when from the Presentation layer invoke operations processes. To get permission to invoke I have a indirection from the layer Presentation to the Mediator Presentation  TProcessXXX  Mediator And then we obtained permission another for each activity Presentation  TProcessXXX  TDataStructurep  pWhen a process receives permission, captures for himself using TDataStructure. It takes over until the operation is completed. Meanwhile, other processes are idle. And from the Presentation layer may be giving you request to operate needlessly.p  pI considered disabling controls, which is the most straightforward and easy. But then would have to be enabling and disabling all the time.p  pI ask What alternatives do you recommend Is there a pattern to work on the theme of idle processesp  hr  pEDITp  pI have studied alternatives such as Strategy and Visitor but I am not sure if they are the best option. And I admit that perhaps these 3 patterns Mediator, Strategy, Visitor do not dominate the 100. I forgot to clarify this. My apologies.p  pI would also add that if I deserve a negative vote, at least be kind enough to post a comment explaining why.p  hr  pEDIT 2p  pAs recommended, I attached a link to a picture of the state diagram img srchttpi.stack.imgur.coml8ezU.jpg altenter image description herep  pIn the diagram you can see that there is a choise. Is designed so that at startup evaluates which was the last state reached and to continue from that point.p  pIn this diagram I have separate activities in five processes configuration, manage set, training, testing and recognition.p  pAnd I added one more, the sixth named initializer, which has the function to initialize the data structure with the data accessed from a database.p  pEach Process is a Collegue for the Mediator. The Mediator implements this state diagram and decides to process him permission to operate.p

Negative 5029 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comkarlhorkygray relnofollowGraya for a few elements on the site. However, I cant get it to work in IE11. For example, in the fiddle below, I use JS to add the codegrayscalecode and codegrayscalefadecode classes so that the image fades from color to grayscale on hover. How would I get this to work in IE11 The author says that the plugin needs to be initialized for IE11 i.e. codearticle.project img.graycode, but if I add that line, all of the images turn gray by default from the start. I just want this to work in IE11.

My custom subclasses dont have any delegate methods of their own, but I thought that since they were subclasses... their delegate methods would be subclassed as well and need to be defined inside of the UIViewController that initializes the UISearchController.p  pAfter initializing the UISearchController, I set its delegate and the searchbars delegate to the UIViewControllerp  precodesearchController  [[VLSearchController alloc] initWithSearchResultsControllernil] self.searchController.searchBar.delegate  self  self.searchController.delegate  self codepre  pThe following delegate methods in my UIViewController dont get calledp  precodepragma mark  UISearchBarDelegate  voidsearchBarSearchButtonClickedUISearchBar searchBar  pragma mark  UISearchController  voidwillPresentSearchControllerUISearchController searchController  pragma mark  UISearchResultsUpdating  voidupdateSearchResultsForSearchControllerUISearchController searchController codepre  pLet me also mention that the reason that I subclassed the UISearchController as well as the UISearchBar was to get rid of the cancel button.

Negative 5029 pSo, basically all my eventstheres min. 360 of them have codeteam1 vs. team2code or code vs. team2code or codeteam1 vs. code placeholders.

Any help with this would be awesome.  p  h2UPDATEh2  pI just wanted to add my final solution that worked for my situation.  p  precodeSELECT Users.userId, Users.username, Users.editLibraries, Users.editAnnouncements, Users.editServices,     Users.editNormalHours, Users.editSpecialHours, Users.editUsers, Users.editSemesters,     Libraries.libraryName, LibraryDepartment.departmentName     FROM Users     LEFT JOIN UserLibs on Users.userId  UserLibs.userId     LEFT JOIN Libraries on UserLibs.libraryId  Libraries.id     LEFT JOIN UserDepts on Users.userId  UserDepts.userId     LEFT JOIN LibraryDepartment on UserDepts.departmentId  LibraryDepartment.ldId     WHERE Users.usernametestname codepre

Negative 5029 pI have met an issue of unproper selection of items in codeTListBoxcode in my application with a codeHorzScrollBoxcode in the form. The form  has two or more codeTListBoxcode on it. They are placed away from each other so that their absolute left coordinates difference is more than the width of the current device screen width. The error appears in the following sequence of user actions.p  ol liAn item is selected from the left codeTListBoxcodeli liThe HorzScrollBox is scrolled to the right and the second codeTListBoxcode becomes visible to user and the left one  invisible.li liThe HorzScrollBox is scrolled back to the left.li liAn new item is selected from the left codeTListBoxcode.li ol  pWe get the following picture The new item is selected but the selection stays painted over the position of the previously selected item even if we scroll the box up and down. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comgJByL.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgJByL.jpg altenter image description hereap  pIt is possible to reproduce the bug in a very simple way. p  ol liCreate a new Grid MetropolisUI Application.li liReplace the left standard codeTListBoxcode with a new one it will be faster.li liSet the width of the form larger then your screen widthli liPlace the second new codeTListBoxcode inside the codeHorzScrollBoxcode in such a way so that left and right codeTListboxescode will not be seen simultaneously and selection of items is possible only after scrolling of the codeHorzScrollBoxcode.li liPopulate them from any sources ex. two codeTPrototypeBindSourcecode and set the codeListItemStylecode properties of created codeLinkFieldControlToFieldcode to codeMetropolisUIcode.li ol  pDone. When you run the application you get the issue.

Negative 5029 pI use EMACSAucTeX. In order to compile I do Cc Cc, then it asksp  pCommand default LaTeX p  pI press RET and it is compiled. To view the compiled document I do Cc Cv.p  pI would like to have a simple shortcut, like pressing F1 or some other key combination to compile and then view the document. There is any simple commandfunction that can be inserted in .emacs to do thatp  pThanks Pietrop
Negative 5029 pRefering to a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms189499.aspx relnofollowherea regarding the order of execution of SELECT query, there is an codeONcode mentioned before codeJOINcode. p  precodeFROM ON JOIN WHERE GROUP BY WITH CUBE or WITH ROLLUP HAVING SELECT DISTINCT ORDER BY TOP codepre  pI tend to think this codeONcode is the codeONcode clause as part of the codeJOINcode.p  ul lipIf it is false, what is this codeONcode pli lipIf it is true, then it is a bit confusing, because I think when doing a codeJOINcode, SQL Server do a codeCROSS JOINcode before filtering with codeONcode. This may not be strictly correct as SQL server has some mechanism to optimize this process, something regarding chosing one smaller table as inner table to loop the outer table as I remember correctly for the codeONcode condition. Then in this case, wouldnt codeJOINcode be before codeONcode in execution order pli ul  pCould you shed some light on what I mention p
