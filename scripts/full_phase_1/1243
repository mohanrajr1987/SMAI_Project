Negative 1243 pFor those who havent read Code Complete 2, the Pseudocode Programming Process is basically a way to design a routine by describing it in plain English first, then gradually revise it to more detailed pseudocode, and finally to code. The main benefit of this is to help you stay at the right level of abstraction by building systems topdown rather than bottomup, thereby evolving a clean API in distinct layers. I find that TDD is less effective at this, because it focuses too much on doing the bare minimum to get a test to pass and encourages little upfront design. I also find that having to maintain a suite of unit tests for unstable code code thats constantly being refactored is quite difficult, because its typically the case that you have a dozen unit tests for a routine thats only needed once or twice. When you do refactor  change a method signature, for example  most of the work you do is in updating the tests rather than the prod code. I prefer adding unit tests after a components code has stabilized a bit.p  pMy question is  of those whove tried both approaches, which do you preferp

Negative 1243 pIm writing an ASP.NET application. I have a textbox on a webform, and I want to force whatever the user types to upper case. Id like to do this on the front end. You should also note that there is a validation control on this textbox, so I want to make sure the solution doesnt interfere with the ASP.NET validation.p  pstrongClarificationstrong It appears that the CSS text transform makes the user input appear in uppercase. However, under the hood, its still lower case as the validation control fails. You see, my validation control checks to see if a valid state code is entered, however the regular expression Im using only works with uppercase characters.p

Negative 1243 pIve got a routine that grabs a list of all images in a directory, then runs an MD5 digest on all of them. Since this takes a while to do, I pop up a window with a progress bar. The progress bar is updated by a lambda that I pass in to the longrunning routine.p  pThe first problem was that the progress window was never updated which is normal in WPF I guess. Since WPF lacks a codeRefreshcode command I fixed this with a call to codeDispatcher.Invokecode. Now the progress bar is updated for a while, then the window stops being updated. The longrunning work does eventually finish and the windows go back to normal.p  pI have already tried a BackgroundWorker and quickly became frustrated by a threading issue related to an event triggered by the longrunning process. So if thats really the best solution and I just need to learn the paradigm better, please say so.p  pBut Id be really much happier with the approach Ive got here, except that it stops updating after a bit for example, in a folder with 1000 files, it might update for 50100 files, then hang.

Negative 1243 pOk here is my situation. Ive studied Java in my college for 2 semesters. But you know they teach you jack in there, just the basics. We skipped half of our textbook and even then our professors dont teach from section to section of each chapter. I dont blame them. Its hard as it is for new students to understand even the basic concepts of programming. Now this is a strongcommunity collegestrong we are talking about and not Stanford, MIT or Berkeley.p  pSo like I said Ive done 2 semester of Java. I really like our textbook because it has some challenging projects to do at the end of each chapter. This textbook is pretty clear and i have no problem understanding it although 2D and 3D Arrays have given me some trouble. I have tried reading a few C books such as Pro C 2008 and .NET 3.5 and C 4.0 in a  Nutshell. I found these books to be dry and overloaded with information that put me to sleep No offense to the authors of those 2 wonderful, emaccording to amazon ratingsem, books.p  pWould you suggest I finish my Java textbook, brush up my knowledge of Arrays, Polymorphism, and etc that are universal to most programming languages. And then switch to C, plus the syntax is very similar so it should be easy to switch. Or should I just start learning C right now from the very beginning If its the latter then could you recommend some free online resources that will keep me engaged and at the same time teach me everything I need to know about C.p  pSomeone has recommended me to learn .NET first, but I found it to be not the brightest idea. .NET is just a big monster full of libraries. How am I going to apply it if I dont even know the C or VB Anyway back to my question Master Java and switch to C or just go with Cp  pDISCLAIMER I dont want to start .NET vs J2EE or C vs Java flame war. I am going with C. Ive decided that I want to work in a Microsoft shop in the future. .NET is what I want to learn.p  pThanks Will be waiting for the answers.p

Negative 1243 pIts Sunday, time for a round of code golfp  h1Challengeh1  pWrite the shortest source code by character count to determine if an input number is a happy prime, sad prime, happy nonprime, or sad nonprime.p  h1Inputh1  pThe input should be a integer that comes from a command line argument or stdin.  Dont worry about handling big numbers, but do so if you canwant.  Behavior would be undefined for input values less than 1, but 1 has a definite result.p  h1Outputh1  pOutput should print the type of number happy prime, sad prime, happy nonprime, or sad nonprime.  The trailing newline is optional.p  h1Examplesh1  precode happyprime 139 happy prime  happyprime 2 sad prime  happyprime 440 happy nonprime  happyprime 78 sad nonprime codepre  h1Definitionsh1  pJust in case your brain needs a refresher.p  h2Happy Numberh2  pFrom Wikipedia,p  blockquote   pA a hrefhttpwww.wikipedia.orgwikiHappynumberhappy numbera is defined by the   following process. Starting with any   positive integer, replace the number   by the sum of the squares of its   digits, and repeat the process until   the number equals 1 where it will   stay, or it loops endlessly in a   cycle which does not include 1. Those   numbers for which this process ends in   1 are happy numbers, while those that   do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers   or sad numbers.p blockquote  pFor example,p  ul li139li li12  32  92  91li li92  12  82li li82  22  68li li62  82  100li li12  02  02  1li ul  h2Prime Numberh2  pA a hrefhttpwww.wikipedia.orgwikiPrimenumberprime numbera is an integer greater than 1 and has precisely two divisors 1 and itself.p  h2Happy Primeh2  pA happy prime, is therefore a number that is both happy and prime.p  h1Answer Selectionh1  pObviously the answer will be the shortest source code by character count that outputs the specified results in all cases that I test.

Negative 1243 pIm working on an ASP.NET MVC 2 project with some business entities that have metadata dataannotations attributes applied to them Validation attributes, Display attributes, etc.. p  pSomething likep  precodeUser entity public class User               [DisplayNameVorname]             [RequiredErrorMessage  Vorname fehlt]             [StringLengthMaxNameLength, ErrorMessage  Vorname ist zu lang]             public string FirstName  get set               [DisplayNameNachname]             [RequiredErrorMessage  Nachnamefehlt]             [StringLengthMaxNameLength, ErrorMessage  Nachname ist zu lang]             public string LastName  get set               [Required]             public string Password get set   codepre  pUsing the metadata from different views is no problem, as long as I am using my business entities as viewmodels or as part of a viewmodel like thisp  precodecustom viewmodel with a user entity public class CustomViewModel     public Usergetset    some more properties...  codepre  pHowever, sometimes I need to code a view for editing some, but not all fields of an entity. For those fields I want to reuse the metadata already specified in my user entity. The other fields should be ignored. Im talking about custom view models like thisp  precode[MetadataTypetypeofUser] public class UserNameViewModel                       public string FirstName  get set                   public string LastName  get set                   no password on purpose, the user should only                  edit his first and last name in this view      codepre  pThats where I am running into problems. The custom view model above leads to an exception when the view is generated, because it has no password property. p  blockquote   pThe associated metadata type for type   Zeiterfassung.Models.ViewModels.Users.UserNameViewModelUserModel   contains the following unknown   properties or fields Password. Please make sure   that the names of these members match   the names of the properties on the   main type.p blockquote  pAlso, even if this exception did not occur, I expect to get into even more trouble with model validation on form submit because Password is marked as required in my business entity. p  pI can think of several workarounds, but none seem really ideal. In any case I cant change the database layout so that the password field would be in a separate entity in my example above. p  pHow would you handle this scenariop

Negative 1243 pso Im using qtip for jquery....and I have the following codep  precodecontent a[href].qtip           content Some basic content for the tooltip,  Give it some content, in this case a simple string        style         name cream,  Inherit from preset style       tip topLeft       ,       show              when click,  Show it on click...             solo true  ...and hide all others when its shown       ,       hide            when  focusout,           fixed true            codepre  pso the desired effect is that the tip should display when I click on the link and stay there unless if I click on some other part of the page hence the focusout, but at the same time if I click on the tip itself, I dont want it to disappear so that I can insert interesting stuff in it, hence the fixed true...but then even when I do this it would still disappear when I click on the tip...what am i doing wrong or is there another way to prevent the tip from disappearing when i click on it but have it disappear if i click on another part of the page p
Negative 1243 pI am currently programming a book store using MVC in Object Orientated PHP and I am having a hard time working out how the controller should work when dealing with requests, especially when dealing with forms.p  pFor example, I have a search form that is shown when the user visits index.phpactionsearch however I am unsure how i should deal with the search string from the form as i cannot send the GET[action]  search again so that index.phpactionsearchsearchstring is sent to the browser so that the search results are shown without using a hidden field to send the search action which is of course very unsecurep  pI feel like this is all too much effort for what its worth and proceedural seems a better way of attempting this so far Unless you can convince me otherwisep  pThanksp  pDan.p

Negative 1243 pbr Im working on a project in computational biology and I need to store an index of locuses that differ between many sequences.

Negative 1243 pI have a directed graph with flow volumes along edges and I would like to simplify it by removing all cyclic flows. This can be done by finding the minimum of the flow volumes along each edge in any given cycle and reducing the flows of every edge in the cycle by that minimum volume, deleting edges with zero flow. When all cyclic flows have been removed the graph will be acyclic.p  pFor example, if I have a graph with vertices A, B and C with flows of 1 from AB, 2 from BC and 3 from CA then I can rewrite this with no flow from AB, 1 from BC and 2 from CA. The number of edges in the graph has reduced from 3 to 2 and the resulting graph is acyclic.p  pWhich algorithms, if any, solve this problemp

Negative 1243 pI am talking to a custom made labdevice little hardware thingy through a USBconnection. How do I acquire data from the labdevice at maximum speedp  pThe host is a Windows XP machine, running ccode using libsubwin32 in Visual Studio. The little hardware thingy collects data, lots of data. The host can request this data and then read it. Everything is working just fine. What bothers me is the speed, a rough estimate is 1Mbits, which is far from the 480 Mbits USB2 supports. The device should be able to send me data at at least that speed. I have little to no experience with neither USB nor libusbwin32, but I have tried to read about them.  Though I dont see where and how to change any USBcommuncation settings. In the spec there seems to be something called microframes on high speed buses. How can I use them p  pI dont necessarily have to use the libusbwin32 library. Do you have any other recommendationsp  pemDetails about the current implementationem As mentioned above I use libusbwin32 for communication. All initialization is copied from a small example included in the download.p  precodeusbinit  ... usbopen usbsetconfiguration... usbclaiminterface... codepre  pThen I talk using usbbulkwrite... and usbbulkread...  to the labdevice and convince it to share its data with me, which it does. It gives me data in chunks of 512 bytes. Each such chunk is read using usbbulkread....p  pstrongEdit April 27th 2011strong It looks like I am using Full Speed, but not High Speed. How do I get highspeed Did I get some parameter wrong in the usb descriptor file  Yes, Im using USB2.0, and the device should support highspeed.p  hr  pstrongEdit May 17th 2011strong I have now implemeted the communication using winUSB wrote an .inf file and cprogram. The benefit of using WinUSB is that it can tell me if it is trying to use high speed or not. And it is, but I still dont get more than around 112 Mbits. Why p  pAccording to the USB2.0 protocol the computer should be sending a Start of frame marker sent each ms, which I think it is doing  thus the 11Mbits. But when using hispeed it says high speed uses the Microframe which is 125us long 8 Microframes per millisecond. The correspondence with the 1ms frame numbering is maintained in the high speed SOF packets by repeating each frame number in 8 successive Microframes. I dont really understand this, but not sending the microframes often enough could be the problem Could someone who understands the protocol please enlighten me I want to understand how the thing worksregardless of if I can get it working on my computer or not.p  hr  pstrongEdit June 15thstrongp  pProblem solved No alterations on the computer side can make the communication faster than it wants to be if you dont change the number of endpoints and you really have a USB2.0 connection. The problem here was in the processor code which used its memory areas in a very timeconsuming way. This makes this question a nonquestion sort of. Thanks for all the pointers and information.

Negative 1243 pjust a quick question about Blueprint CSS. I have a threecolumn template, with spans 5, 14 and 5last respectively. The first two columns work wonderfully, the content functions properly. However, in the 3rd and last column, the content will not display properly. I can get the images and text to move and position properly, but my links wont act properly upon hovering, my radio buttons wont select, and none of the text is selectable. It is as if there is no column there at all. I know this is probably a simple fix, but I appreciate the help.

Negative 1243 pI want to be able to skip validation if a certain attribute is set to false, say status,  problem is this model has many nested attributes to them, and they need to skip validation too if status is false. p  pThe purpose of such implantation is that if one wanted to save a draft of there form entry, for whatever reason, having it going through validation could halt them saving it, which is not desirable behavior, and only need to validate entries that are going public by setting status to true.p  pExample belowp  pattribute status located in Articlep  precodemodel Article   hasmany subarticles   acceptsnestedattributesfor subarticles, allowdestroy gt true    validatepresenceof body, unless gt Proc.newarticle article.status   model SubArticle   belongsto article   hasmany foos   acceptsnestedattributesfor foos, allowdestroy gt true        validatepresenceof body, unless gt Proc.newsubarticle subarticle.article.status   model Foo   belongsto subarticle    validatepresenceof body, unless gt Proc.newfoo foo.subarticle.article.status  codepre  pvalidation skipping for Article will work, but will not for SubArticle or Foo since they have not been saved an there ids are not set, not making them able to traverse up the associations like in the example. p  pIs it possible to access associated table attributes at the point of validationp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pUpdatedp  pThe reason validation for SubArticle and Foo fail is because of a p  blockquote   pundefined method status for   nilNilClassp blockquote  pThis is expected because of the time of validation the articleid or subarticleid is still nil, Ive comfirmed this by doing p  precodemodel SubArticle   belongsto article   hasmany foos    validatepresenceof body, unless gt Proc.newsubarticle subarticle.article.checkattributes   def checkattributes   pp self end codepre  pwitch givesp  precodeltSubArticle id nil, body , articleid nil, createdat nil, updatedat nil gt codepre  pupdated 2p  pI forgot and important detail, all of the data for the models are entered at once using a nested form, so at the moment of create, all of the entries on all of the models are only in memory, fixing example code so that would be more obvious.p

Negative 1243 pUp until now Ive only used DLLs as a source for plugins in my applications.p  pBut I know that using DLLs will allow me to update my program client side a lot easier the redownloading the main EXE all time.p  pThe problem is, I cant seem to find an effective way to use dlls in my application, or to use them in a way that would impact the program, but not force me to change the way the entire program works.p  pThe application in this instance is an XNA Game.p  pSo for example, I have three main classes excluding the main game Classp  pUnits Players Networking.p  pI would like to have the UnitsPlayers in one DLL, and the Networking in another DLL, or at emleastem move the networking to a separate DLL, But the way the networking class works and is coded would require the DLL to have a reference to the Game, and the Game to have a reference to the DLL, which is prevented in Visual Studio to prevent circular dependencies.p  pMy question, is how can I effectively use a DLL to store my networking class, I have a couple of ideas, but Im not sure how feasible any of them is yet.p  pWhat I would like, if possible, would be to have the entire networking instance running from the dll, sending receiving, and updating the game data as needed.p  pBut so far I have only been able to come up with a way to have the receiving and sending in the Main game.exe and move the handling functions into the dll, and even then, the handling functions cannot easily communicate with the game.p  pI also thought of using the Plugin System, but that requires me to use Delegates for all my functions that I want to use in the Networking DLL, and seems very inefficient in the long run.p  pIf this sort of thing cant be done with DLLs back and forth communication between the Host program and dll, then what use are they anywayp  pSure I can have simple functions, like my Color class, to parse and return color codes, but simple things arent going to change, and need to be updated.p  pAnyway, I always tend to ramble about things that dont matter for the most part, so thanks for taking a look, and for any responses p

Negative 1243 pIm having trouble with a simple autoincrement using common table expressions.  I dont want ROWNUMBER because I will be using conditions for my incrementing so here is a simplified version of my problem which still doesnt work.  I get this error Invalid column name n when I try the followingp  precode WITH NumberSongPair  n,s  AS      SELECT 0 as n,SongKey as s from Songs where SongKey  1     UNION ALL     SELECT 1  n as n,SongKey as s      from Songs      WHERE n lt 500  SELECT n,s FROM NumberSongPair OPTION  MAXRECURSION 500  codepre  pWhy cant it recognize n as a newly a created incremented column  Id even be happy just getting rid of the first select all together so long as I can keep incrementing a number as I select columns from a table.p  pIf you are curious about my overall goals its to ranks Songs.... with conditions with something like thisp  precode WITH Nbrs  base, n,ctr  AS      SELECT 0,0,0 UNION ALL     SELECT 1  base,n  case                          when base  120 then ctr                         when ctr lt20 then ctr                         else null end,                  ctr  case                         when base  120 then ctr  1                         else ctr end     FROM Nbrs WHERE base lt 500  SELECT n FROM Nbrs OPTION  MAXRECURSION 500  codepre  pstrongEDIT...strongp  pSorry, my explanation wasnt very good.  I just wanted to add another psuedo autoincrementing column that would sometimes go null instead of increment.  Basically Im trying something like thisp  precodedeclare songs table songkey int, dropable bit, points int  insert songs values 1, 1, 1 insert songs values 2, 1, 20 insert songs values 3, 1, 3 insert songs values 3, 0, 11  insert songs values 4, 0, 4 insert songs values 6, 0, 2   select rownumber overorder by points desc as RankingPosition, songkey, dropable, points  from Songs codepre  pBut adding the following condition dropable songs lose their ranking are null if they dont make the top 3.  This means SongKey 2 wont drop, but but 4 and 6 will.  So the output would look like p  ul liPositionRank 1  Songkey 2li liPositionRank 2  Songkey 3li liPositionRank 3  Songkey 4li liPositionRank 4  Songkey 6li liPositionRank null  Songkey 4li liPositionRank null  Songkey 1li ul  pRank is determined by points, but there are conditions.  p

Negative 1243 pMy problem is with detached objects...p  pI am currently using Spring with Hibernate.p  pI have a mapped object that has a primary key as a String I know it sucks... but refactoring the code would take months, and I wish to persist it. I have simplified the object with just two attributesp  precodeId private String id  private String pattern codepre  pSo for example I want to add something likep  p[idmyFirstPattern,pattern.]p  pNotice that my primary key is already set. The problem with that is that whenever I try to persist, Hibernate will try to link this object with any object within the context because of the primary key and will fail to do so, since there are none. Throwing a detached object error.p  pIve done some research and came to the conclusion that merge would suffice my needs, since it persists and updates even if the object is not available. However I found this a rather dirty workaround and wanted to check if there are any other solutions to this problem.p  pTake into account that we have a Helper layer, so Services layer will not work directly with the HibernateDao layer. So I can mask this by adding persist and update methods that will invoke the same merge DAO method.p  pThanks, Flavio.p

Negative 1243 pGood day,p  pThis is more web service design than programming question I think. Ill try to explain what I want to achieve. In example I have a 3 combo boxese.g. size, color, texture on the page which are dependent on each other. We can select them only in turnseg. 1st2nd3rd. After selecting combo box value, next combo box gets populatedenabled and we are able to select from it too.p  pI came up with a few solutions which I can apply for this problem.p  ol liIs when we come to the page and loaded JavaScript sends a post with a request for data to populate those combo boxes. The response returned is a batch data of all variantsJSON is parsed and handled by JavaScript with every selection client does.li liPage is loaded with only first combo box and the remaining ones gets filled with the default values. Every time client selects a value, appropriate eventajax which leads to post get is fired to fillhandle next combo boxes dependent on selections.li ol  pMyself I see that first one is quite complicated and the batch value can be very big in terms if there are lots of selection variations for each of the value. And the second one seems does too many useless requests to the server which I think can lead to server overload. What do you think of these solutions Does the concept is okey And is it worth to implement first solution instead of second one even it is harder  If something you do not understand in my explanation please ask Ill try to explain in more detail.p
Negative 1243 pI am working on a struts2 project where I have 3 html select controls each one being dependent on the previous selection. Say the first select is for country, second for state, third for city. The list of options in the state select would be filtered to only display the states in that country and so on. Due to some other limitations I am using the basic html select control instead of struts2s.

Negative 1243 pThis is one of those, why does it happen kind of questions.  I need to take an Int32 value and OR it with the minimum value of its type as a resulting of porting a 10 year old VBA application.p  pThis breaks the compiler with a warning and an error, first the code that breaks, then the code that works and then the error message.p  pBreaks compiler please disregard the name of the variable, the VBA type is long and I am using Int32p  precodeUInt32Val  UInt32Val  0x80000000 codepre  pThis does not break the compilerp  precodeUInt32Val  UInt32Val  Int32.MinValue codepre  pThe errors I get are as followsp  ol liBitwiseor operator used on a signextended operand consider casting to a smaller unsigned type firstli liCannot implicitly convert type long to int. An explicit conversion exists are you missing a castli ol  pIt is my understanding that both 0x80000000 and Int32.MinValue equal 2147483648.p  pMy big issue with this port is that the VBA application is using long and int which translate to .NET as Int32 and Int16 respectively, and there is a lot of bit shifting and swapping going on.  p  pSo my thinking is to make sure the size and signed property of the variables are the same to make sure I get the same values in the ported application as I do in the VBA application.p  pAt any rate, conceptually, am I hiding a problem if I am able to fix the compiler issue by swapping an original octal value for a constant  Im about to run both apps and start comparing values, but I really want to understand what is happening here.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1243 pOk so lets say I have two classes, class A and class B. They both need to perform a common operation but it wouldnt make sense to have them both derive from the same object so instead we go with composition. Basically, has a makes sense where is a doesnt.p  pNow each of the two classes instantiate this object and use it to perform the common operation and all is good. Everything is fine, now.p  pThe problem arises when each of these two classes have to expose an event that the common routine must raise. Uh oh. Now whatp  pWell, we could do something like this in each of the two classesp  precodepublic event EventHandler CommonEvent      add  theCommonObject.CommonEvent  value      remove  theCommonObject.CommonEvent  value   codepre  pBut now this code needs to be duplicated in each of the two classes and readers of the code may be somewhat confused by this code as well. codeaddcode and coderemovecode are not very commonly seen keywords, at least.p  pStill, there is duplicate code in both of the two classes and not only that, but this solution will not always workp  pFor example, what if codetheCommonObjectcode is locally instantiated in a single method and its scope is only within that one method.p  pWell then, in that case we cannot even use the shortcut code posted earlier and we have to completely duplicate the code in both classes. Not only that but it just screams inelegance because were basically just reraising a copy of the event to clients.p  pExample code that would have to be duplicated in each class in this casep  precodepublic event EventHandler SomeCommonEvent  private void SomeMethod      theCommonObject  new theCommonObject      theCommonObject.DoSomething      theCommonObject.SomeCommonEvent  thisClassSomeCommonEvent   private void thisClassSomeCommonEventobject sender, EventArgs e      var handler  SomeCommonEvent      if handler  null              handlerthis, e       codepre  pAs you can see, in both cases there is duplicate code but in the second there is even more because the object is local to a method rather than a member variable.p  pI cannot really think of a way around this, other than using inheritance but I dont think it makes semantic sense to do so, and many often claim that composition is superior to inheritance in terms of complexityreduction, easeofunderstanding, et cetera.p
Negative 1243 pI was wondering how I can channel or simulate Google Maps just in the sense of a user types in a location in text, such as a restaurant name and a city name. Then Google suggests 5 or so places they have indexed, and presumably they know the GPS coordinates because Google then puts them on a map. I want to be able to use that feature not the map, just getting the location. p  pMy goal is for a user to type in a query, 5 options or so to be shown, and if they user chooses one of them, then the GPS coordinates, or a location object, is saved representing that place. p  pIdeally I could just send the query to Google and steal the results back to my app. Obviously building my own database of locations and an algorithm to suggest them is out of the question. p  pThanks for the help and advice in advancedp  hr  pNote 1 To clarify, this does NOT involve the current position of the userdevice.  p  pNote 2 I looked at the Google Maps addon API, but it looks like that is for a visual map, not the querying a location part.

Negative 1243 pI have a problem assigned for school that really has me confused. Basically, in class we are learning about recursion. As homework, and an introduction to mutual recursion, we are supposed to write a math expression evaluator that uses mutual recursion. The three methods, emgetExpressionValueem, emgetTermValueem, and emgetFactorValueem need to call each other in order to get the result. We are supposed to support addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parenthesized expressions. In searching for ideas on how to do this, I keep coming across recursive descent parsing, but I am not sure if that idea is appropriate for this problem. p  pIf someone could provide me with guidance or maybe a link to an article that explains how to do parsing like this, I would be very appreciative. Thanks. p

Negative 1243 pemGreetings StackOverflow communityemp  pI have been learning Rails for the past few days and extending the basic blog example in the official Rails guide. I wanted to learned more about onetoone connections since Im planning on extending the Devise login system with a custom user data table and the rules of normalization dictate that I should make a different table for the actual auth data the devise user table and another for the appspecific user info my own user table.p  pBut now back to a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orggettingstarted.html relnofollowsimple rails examplea. The example basically describes an app that can create blog posts, tag them and accept comments comments dont really matter right now. A post codehasmanycode tags and a tag codebelongstocode a post. Pretty straightforward. same thing can be said about the comments, too, but Ill just stick with the tags for this examplep  pWhen a user wishes to create a NEW post, the controller has a call to codepost  Post.newcode which prepares an empty post to be edited and created. It also needs to call post.tags.build to make sure that at least one baby tag which would belong to the post is ready for editing code5.times do post.tags.build endcode, for instance would prepare not one but five tags for editing.p  pIn the controllers create method, its enough to create a new post from codeparams[post]code and codepost.savecode it. It saves the tags automatically without any extra function calls needing to be made.p  pHeres where I started extending. I just wanted to add another table, called postdata, that would get linked onetoone to the original posts table. postdata contains a foreign key to the post it belongs to, as well as a codebelongsto postcode instruction in its model. The post codehasone postdatacode. It also codeacceptsnestedattibutesfor postdatacode. p  pAgain, in the new method of the post controller, postdata needs to be initialized.codepost.buildpostdatacode does just this. The form displays just fine the two different models  one as post[title]...etc and the other as postdata[datafieldnamehere].p  pHowever, in the create name, the postdata entry needs to be emmanuallyem saved codepost.createpostdataparams[postdata]code in order for it to be entered into the db. Otherwise it just doesnt get saved.p  pNow my question is this  how come the hasmany objects of the post, the tags, just need to be prepared in the controllers new method, and then get saved in create automatically, while hasone links also need to be manually savedp  pIm just wandering as to why Rails would work like this.p  pThanks in advance for your time and patience p  h1Edit The code filesh1  h2postscontrollerh2  precodeclass PostsController lt ApplicationController  GET posts  GET posts.json def index   posts  Post.all    respondto do format     format.html  index.html.erb     format.json  render json gt posts    end end   GET posts1  GET posts1.json def show   post  Post.findparams[id]    respondto do format     format.html  show.html.erb     format.json  render json gt post    end end   GET postsnew  GET postsnew.json def new   post  Post.new   post.buildpostdata   5.times do post.tags.build end end   GET posts1edit def edit   post  Post.findparams[id] end   POST posts  POST posts.json def create    This works now  it creates all the needed resources automatically   post  Post.newparams[post]    respondto do format     if post.save       format.html  redirectto post, notice gt Post was successfully created.      else       format.html  render action gt new      end   end end   PUT posts1  PUT posts1.json def update   post  Post.findparams[id]    respondto do format     if post.updateattributesparams[post]       format.html  redirectto post, notice gt Post was successfully updated.      else       format.html  render action gt edit      end   end end   DELETE posts1  DELETE posts1.json def destroy   post  Post.findparams[id]   post.destroy    respondto do format     format.html  redirectto postsurl    end end end codepre  h2postsform.html.erbh2  precodelt formforpost do postform gt   lt if post.errors.any gt     ltdiv iderrorexplanationgt       lth2gtlt pluralizepost.errors.count, error gt prohibited this post from being savedlth2gt        ltulgt       lt post.errors.fullmessages.each do msg gt         ltligtlt msg gtltligt       lt end gt       ltulgt     ltdivgt   lt end gt    ltdiv classfieldgt     lt postform.label name gtltbr gt     lt postform.textfield name gt   ltdivgt   lt postform.fieldsforpostdata do pdf  gt   ltdiv classfieldgt     lt pdf.label herp, DERP POST DATA gtltbr gt     lt pdf.textfield herp gt   ltdivgt lt end gt    ltdiv classfieldgt     lt postform.label title gtltbr gt     lt postform.textfield title gt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classfieldgt     lt postform.label content gtltbr gt     lt postform.textarea content gt   ltdivgt  lth2gtTagslth2gt lt render partial gt tagsform,             send some custom variables to the            rendered partials context            locals gt  form gt postform  gt    ltdiv classactionsgt     lt postform.submit gt   ltdivgt lt end gt codepre  h2and the posts.rb modelh2  precodeclass Post lt ActiveRecordBase   validates name, presence gt true   validates title, presence gt true, length gt  minimum gt 5     hasmany comments, dependent gt destroy    attraccessible postdataattributes, name, title, content    lets just assume this makes sense, k   hasone postdata   acceptsnestedattributesfor postdata     TAGS   hasmany tags   acceptsnestedattributesfor tags, allowdestroy gt true,      reject if all attributes are blank          rejectif gt lambda  attrs attrs.all  k, v v.blank   end codepre  h1Final edith1  pFixed up all the code, syncing it with my working code D If anybody from the distant future still has this issue and my code doesnt work, send me a personal message and well sort it out p

Negative 1243 pI apologize, because this seems like a pretty straightforward problem that should be obvious, but it appears that Im clueless.p  pIm writing an engine and using Light 0 as the sun for the scene.  I figure, ideally, the sun will be a fixed light source, not a vector, so the wfourth index in the position vector should be 1.0f.p  pI setup the scenes Ortho viewpoint, then setup the light to be at the position of the character xy are coordinates of the plane terrain, with a positive z facing the camera and indicating height on the terrain  the scene is also rotated for an isometric view on the x axis.p  pThe character is always centered in the screen  but Ive noticed that for some reason, the light seems to shine at a position between the character and world coordinates 0,0,0.  The further the character gets from world coordinates 0,0,0, the largerwider the light is.  If the character is at 0,0,0, the light is very small.  If the character moves to something like 0,200,0, the light is HUGE.p  pIm just trying to get my feet wet and have a light that follows the character and then adjust for position, etc, later, to create a sun.p  precode        Graphics.BeginRenderingLayer                      Video.MapRenderingMode              Graphics.BeginLightingLayer Graphics.AmbientR, Graphics.AmbientG, Graphics.AmbientB, Graphics.DiffuseR, Graphics.DiffuseG, Graphics.DiffuseB, pCenter.X, pCenter.Y, pCenter.Z                               Graphics.BeginRenderingLayer                                      Graphics.CenterCamera pCenter.X, pCenter.Y, pCenter.Z                      RenderMap pWorld, pCenter, pCoordinate                                   Graphics.EndRenderingLayer                  Graphics.BeginRenderingLayer                                      Graphics.DrawMan pCenter                                   Graphics.EndRenderingLayer                          Graphics.EndLightingLayer                  Graphics.EndRenderingLayer codepre  pGraphics.BeginRenderingLayer  PushMatrix, EndRenderingLayer  PopMatrix Video.MapRenderingMode  Ortho Projection and Scene RotationZoom CenterCamera does a translate to the opposite of the XYZ, such that the character is now centered at XYZ in the middle of the screen.p  pAny thoughts  Maybe Ive confused some of my code here a littlep

Negative 1243 pI am using codeAdobe Illustrator CS4code for creating images for launching icons to be used by Android applications. I create a set of images according to a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesuiguidelinesicondesignlauncher.html relnofollowdev guide icon sizesa for the  ldpi, mdpi etc. The px is defined on the artboard but nothing about ppiresolution on the vector graphics yet. When the image is finished I want to produce the .png files from each artboard which is configured to be the recommended size for the different densities. Adobe Illustrator has 2 options to produce a .png file the first way is to do codeSave for Web amp Devicescode which allows you to explicitly specify that you want a codePNG24code which Android requires but there is no mention for the dpippi aspect of the image. The second way is codeExportcode which prompts a choice for the codeppicode of the image. p  pSo the first method uses some automatic setting and the resulting images on the properties have same the number of pixels as was defined for the artboard in Illustrator. The second methods pixel numbers on the resulting .png change depending on the codeppicode chosen, and the equal corresponding pixel numbers from artboard to output .png arise only when ppi72. So I conclude that the automatic codeSave for Web amp Devicescode chooses 72ppi as well. In this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq9434671410975question on SOa, I asked about the ppi in Photoshop, and I was recommended to ignore the ppi. p  pWhich route is the consistent one for exporting .png files to match the low, medium, high densities for Android eg. settings for the optionsp

Negative 1243 pI have a Rails 3.2 app running on Heroku, and it uses CKEditor. Now, CKEditor is a pretty large collection of files and folders, and is probably the biggest contributor to the time it takes to precompile assets. A regular push to Heroku takes well over a minute on the assetsprecompile step.p  pSo I now precompile locally, and only when Ive made edits, before I push to Heroku, to shorten deploy times. However, my poor old Windows laptop easily breaks 15 minutes for rake assetsprecompile. This makes it a huge pain to make minor edits or additions to js or css files.p  pI do have config.assets.initializeonprecompile  false as required by Heroku docs. But Im pretty sure the real time hog is compression, i.e. Uglifier. p  pDoes anyone have a suggestion to how I can remedy this Am I simply doing it wrong Is there a way to only compile changed files Couldshould I move CKEditor directly to the public dir to avoid precompilingp

Negative 1243 pI have an app that revolves around the devices GPS and the information that comes from it. It is important that the location data be accurate and uptodate. I know that the device is limited by its GPS and the GPSs limits, but I was wondering if there is anything I can do to tweakimprove the performance of the iPhone GPS, particularly in the speed area. Because location updates lag about 35 seconds behind the realtime location of the device, the velocity reported by the location manager also lags that far behind the realtime value. In my case, that is simply too long.

Negative 1243 pIm writing an SVN precommit.bat file which calls a Python script to query our issue tracking system to determine of the usersupplied issue tracking ID is in the correct state e.g. open state and associated with the right project. The SVN server is running Windows 2003 server I think  I can check with our IT group if it matters.... p  pThe issue is that I cant seem to make the SVN commit fail it always succeeds. AFAIK the Python script is doing what it should it calls sys.exit1 for failures and sys.exit0 for success.

Also Im quite sure the err function getting run, it is simply that the exit 1 return code is getting ignored by SVNp  pNote Not quite true the only way I have ever made a commit fail is when the Python script has a runtime error.

The HTML files have many interactive features, so its essentially an offline web app.  My question is, what is the best way to implement fulltext search for these HTML files  Basically, the application should index the HTML files it generates, but we want to be able to make the HTML files emand the generated indexem downloadable and available for users to browse and search offline.  What is the best way to do this without writing an actual application to manage it  For example, Ive implemented it using Solr for a demoproofofconcept and that works fine ... but of course that requires HTTP POST and GET requests to a server for indexing and querying.  So since the indexes are really just files, Im wondering if theres a way to query them offline and without firing up a local web server for Solr using just Javascript in the HTML files, maybe with Lucene instead of Solrp

I am currently thinking of using mocha for a unit test framework and zombie.js for a acceptance test framework. I was wondering how could I do full scale acceptance tests which hit the mongodb database. Is there a frameworkmodule that helps with replacing the database with a test database or does either mocha or zombie.js have functionality that can easily be used to replace the database.p  pAlso is there a framework that is similar to the idea of factories instead of fixtures in creating database objects.p  pA similar concept that I have encountered in the rails world is in rspec, there is a spechelper.rb file which runs before the tests are run which set the projects configuration to decide which database to hit when running tests.  And it uses databasecleaner to clean out the test database before tests are run. For factories, i have used Factory girl to create factory objects from database schema again in the rails world.p  pThanksp

But I dont like the idea of continuously polling if I want a second locking operation to block until the first locking operation completes see a hrefhttpsjira.mongodb.orgbrowseSERVER2244 relnofollowhttpsjira.mongodb.orgbrowseSERVER2244a. Also, since locking is managed by the application, if the application or one instance of it goes down for whatever reason during a locking operation, the documents need to be unlocked somehow, without affecting other transactions.p  pIve also looked at a hrefhttpwww.mongodb.orgdisplayDOCSTreesinMongoDB relnofollowhttpwww.mongodb.orgdisplayDOCSTreesinMongoDBa and it seems that none of the examples except for the single document one solves this problem. However, I would like to avoid putting the entire hierarchy into a single document, because of the 16MB document size constraint and the difficulty of moving pages around basically I need to upsert the entire document for every change.p  pbUpdatesbp  pWe hope to support up to 10000 subpages for a page. The IDs for pages are at least 6 characters long. With that in mind, we moved from mySQL because we need to keep track of the order of the subpages. Since mySQL doesnt have array structures, the only way to do that is to use a position column. When pages are moved around frequently, it is expensive to calculate average positions and reindex when the position value becomes too long. Also, if we wanted to put a comma separated list of ids into a column, we would have to use a TEXT column read from disk rather than a VARCHAR which has a limit of 65536 chars in order to support 10000 subpages.p
Negative 1243 pWe have a table codeEVAPPINTERFACEcode that did not specify a scale or precision on a number of numeric columns.  We need to modify the column definition to add appropriate scale and precision but we cannot change the order of the columns in the table.  In order to accomplish this, we are doing the followingp  ul liWe copy all the data to a new table codeEVIcodeli liWe set the numeric columns in the existing codeEVAPPINTERFACEcode table to codeNULLcodeli liWe change the precision of the codeEVAPPINTERFACEcode columnsli liWe copy the data backli ul  pWhen the data is copied back, however, some rows generate an exception because they exceed the new scale andor precision settings i.e. a value of 1 billion in a column that is supposed to store an interest rate.p  precodeERROR  ORA01438 value larger than specified precision allowed for this column  codepre  pI want to identify which column and which rows have this bad data.p  pFirst the duplicate tablep  precode select count into countTab from USERTABCOLUMNS where TABLENAME  EVI  IF  countTab ltgt 0 then      execute immediate drop table EVI     execute immediate create table EVI as select  from EVAPPINTERFACE  ELSE     execute immediate create table EVI as select  from EVAPPINTERFACE  END IF execute immediate TRUNCATE TABLE EVAPPINTERFACE codepre  pThen, I change precisions There are 226 such blocks throughtout the script.p  precode select count into countCol from USERTABCOLUMNS where TABLENAME  EVAPPINTERFACE and COLUMNNAME  PSTNUM and DATASCALE is null    IF    countCol ltgt 0 then     execute immediate alter table EVAPPINTERFACE modify PSTNUM NUMBER14,2        DBMSOUTPUT.putline  EVAPPINTERFACE.PSTNUM has been modified to the required precision  END IF  codepre  pThen, I insert back the old data. This is where it bombsp  precode execute immediate INSERT INTO EVAPPINTERFACE SELECT  from EVI codepre  pSo, I am not entirely sure if SQLERRM and SQLCODE will give the full stacktrace. And, I dont have enough dataset to verify this. Can anyone confirm if there is anyway that I can find out which particular column is causing the issue I have already provided NUMBER14,2 as the precision for most columns, and if possible I want to erase the bad data instead of increasing precision. And since it is production data, I am not allowed to import the data to inspect it.p
Negative 1243 pIm developing kind of a social network in Django, but I dont see the way to maintain coupled my models.p  pI have a model codeUsercode, which can comment on other Users, Pics, Pages capitals are because theyre models via a codeCommentcode model. In order to arrange all that comments I created the Board model, that has one owner and receives all the comments addresed to that owner. The problem is I dont know how is its owner, i.e., which model does it belong to. It could be a pics board, but also a users one. So I end up with a model like thisp  precodeclass Boardmodels.Model    category  models.IntegerField    ownerid  models.IntegerField codepre  pI store owners id and owners category to be able to perform other tasks, but this solution doesnt convince me at all. A friend has advised me to use an abstract class codeBoardcode, and then create a codeUserBoardcode, codePicBoardcode, codePageBoardcode which inherit from codeBoardcode, but I think that will be useless too. Ive thought about codeGenericRelationscode, but Im not sure if that is the correct way to achieve what Im trying. Any proposal will be listened and considered, thanks for your help p  pstrongPSstrong Oh, and sorry if the title isnt very descriptive, but I couldnt figure out a better one.

Negative 1243 pIm writing an app with TriggerIO for Android 3.2 and testing on the Motorola Xyboard Xoom 2 tablet. After migrating to 1.4, my HTML select boxes generate an error when trying to change values, and the application is force closed. To test, I created a vanilla static HTML select box with two test options and it still generates an error when I tap to change values. When rebuilding with 1.3 this error disappears.p  pEdit Thought I should add  migration was a bit tricky, using the Migrate tool in Trigger Toolkit said it was successful, but returned me to my app which was still set to use 1.3 and prompted me to migrate again. After a few of these loops, I then used the command line tool, which again said was successful, but my app was still set to 1.3 and asking me to migrate. In the options tab within the Toolkit, there was only options for 1.3 platform. I ended up changing the platform version to 1.4 by editing the config.json file manually, which finally caused my app to rebuild with 1.4.p

Negative 1243 pI am experience a strange performance issue when accessing data from SQL Server from a Spring based application. In my current setup, the Spring java application runs on a separate machine accessing data from a remote SQL Server DB. I am using NamedParameterTemplate in Spring, which I believe uses Prepared Statement to execute the query. For some reason, some of the query takes a long time to complete approx. 2 mins. The JAVA app runs on a 64bit machine running 64bit version of Java v1.6, and the SQL Server is MS SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pThe strangeness, is if I run the same java app from my laptop running Windows XP 32bit, running the same version of Java v1.6, the query takes less than a second, accessing the exact same remote DB server infact, I am connected through VPNp  pThis shows the issue is not with the Spring framework but may be with the SQL JDBC Driver. I am using Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.0 for SQL Server sqljdbc.jarp  pI am completely clueless, as what could possibly be wrong and not sure where to start my debugging process. I understand, there isnt much information in my question, so please let me know if you need any specific detail.p  pThanks for any helpsuggestions.p

Negative 1243 pI am a 16 year Windows UI developer and am now researching Network Programming on Embedded Devices.  This is completely out of my realm of expertise.  I need to research network programming on 2 devicesp  pDevice 1 will use Windows Embedded Compact 7 WEC7 as its operating system.  It will need to autoconfigure its network plug and play so that it can connect to Device 2 via Ethernet.p  pDevice 2 will act as a switch to connect Device 1 with a PC or LAN.  Device 2 will use our custom operating system and will have 2 Ethernet ports.  We need to write our network code on that system from the ground up.p  pWe want Device 1 and Device 2 to autoconfigure themselves so the user doesnt have to do any configuration of the network.  They should just plug and play.p  pDevice 1  ltPlugs into  Device 2  ltPlugs into  LAN or PCp  pSo where should I look to figure out how to program this network functionality from the ground up on a our custom operating system, and where should I look to learn about Windows Embedded Compact 7 Network autoconfiguration programming  Are there any good books or online tutorials that you would recommendp  pWe havent decided on the protocols we will use, thats what Im trying to research. p  pAny and all help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1243 pWhen mocking dependent services for writing unit test cases for any enterprisegrade java service, I find setting up the data for the unit test cases a huge pain. Most of the times, this is the single most compelling reason for developers to not write unit test cases and rather write integration style test cases. If the service is dependent on couple of other services which depend on their respective DAOs and a DAO of its own, generating the codewhenthenReturncode clauses for a reasonably nested object becomes quite an effort and developers are seen to be taking the easy route and loading the entire spring context and sourcing their data from the direct sources which may not always give the data that can traverse all required code paths. With this in the background, a colleague of mine suggested that why not run a sample integration test, and using aspects, capture all of the relevant data points and serialize it to an XML representation which may be used for materializing test data for the unit test cases. To our pleasant surprise we found a framework called a hrefhttpsgithub.comdavidwongTestDataCaptureJTestDataCaptureJ on githuba which was very similar to this. It used aspects to capture the data points and it generated the java code to create the objects. p  pThe a hrefhttpwww.davidwong.com.auTestDataCaptureJd0e51motivationa stated on the site seemed very apt and I was wondering if there are any other alternatives that can give similar features. Also, it would be great if the experts can critique this overall approach. p  pAlso, the project is about 2 yrs old and has a few bugs which we we had to fix and are hoping to give it back as a mavenized github fork. Just checking to ensure that there is no other similar initiative from one of the wellknown stables as well.p  pThanks in advancep

The main application is written in Delphi XE Win32 and it does some calls to .Net assemblies using COM interop. The current .Net version being used is 3.5.p  pWhen the application executes on a fresh install of Windows 8, it crashes up to 10 times before it suddenly starts to run properly. Once it has started to do OK it will continue to do so. No error logs or error messages are shown. The application just hangs or stops working. p  pI have had the same result on 4 different Win8 installations, both physical and virtual.p  pI have been able to do some remote debugging and managed to track down the error to the .Net method codeDouble.TryParsecode, when trying to parse a nonnumeric value. p  pcodeDouble.Parsecode within a TryCatch block does not work either.p  pThe main assemblies are written in Delphi Prism, but I have been able to reproduce the error with test assemblies written in C using VS2010.p  p.Net 4 seems to work properly, but due to the missing support for Oracle were not able to upgrade right now.p  pThe program works OK on previous versions of Windows, and also on Windows Server 2012.p  pAny hints or suggestions would be really appreciated.p  pemAdditionem I forgot to mention the test assembly works properly when being called from another test application written in C  managed code.

For me, it is required to not have these start and stop bits, even though they are standardized in UART protocol.p  pMy questions Is it possible to use the bang mode of this device to avoid startstop bits and transfer raw data Then, how to program the code for doing this If not, are there any USB transceiver, which have to possibility via COMdriver access to fulfil my requirementp  pThanks a lot in advance for your helpp

Negative 1243 pIm attempting to share Session information between PHP and .NET on the same server. The sessions will always be created by the .NET site.

Negative 1243 pI am building a comment system, where a comment can have many replies. p  pIf I were to implement this in mysql, I would build a codecommentscode table, and have the columns p  ul licodecommentidcode, li licodeparentcommentidcode. li ul  pWhere parent comment id is 0 for a comment, and is the parent comment id for a reply. So if I was looking for replies for a certain comment, I would look for comments that have codeparentcommentidcode to match the comment I am looking for. p  pThis seems redundant to me as it will require me to go through the whole codecommentscode table just to find whether a comment has replies or not especially for large data, Where if I have a keystore database, I would have a key for the comment id, and inside it would be a list of the replies ordered by date. p  pstrongSo which approach do you think is better for this problemstrongp  pAlso, I would like to generalize the problem to any onetomany relationship to be stored as a list in a keystore database. And if you recommend using a keystore database, which one would you recommend for large data  I do not want to use redis for that since it is inmemory, and I doubt that replies for comments need to be access frequently.p  pThanks for replies.p

Negative 1243 pFirstly, my apologies for being sligtly off topic since this does not pertain directly to progamming, but only programmers would know.p  pTheres a lot of a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comzam67.jpg relnofollowbitmap dataa floating around the market, which pay you to enter such data into a text format. Apparently the software that generated these can export bitmaps, but not the data directly, requiring humans to manually type it in again.p  pI did some research online, and it appears both SAP and Lotus 123 can export data, with little or no restrictions. Could it be these or something else Can you identify the legacy software that created such data p

Negative 1243 pIm investigating using Parse for my next project, but one of the requirements is that users be grouped by Account, in an SaaS style application. So, a company signs up for an Account, and then creates users for all their employees, who then basically share everything.p  pIm still wrapping my brain around the Parse way of doing things, but I cant find an example of how this might be done. It appears that ACLs are the way to go, but Im not grokking exactly how.p  pAre there any examples of this kind of architecture using Parse Can I even get there from herep

This works fine but it is quite slow 57 seconds with just 1 user so Ive been trying to put it into a separate thread so the user doesnt get stuck with a huge delay.p  pThe problem Ive been facing is that Rotativa requires the Controller Context to generate the data into the memory stream, which means that if you try to put it in a separate thread and return a notification to the user then the context is disposed and the pdf generation will fail.p  pUnfortunately I do an email validation check on the serverside and return a truefalse where appropriate, false will prompt the user to fix it and try again.

Negative 1243 pI am writing a simple text based adventure game in python.  I will include all of the code because I have no idea what the problem is it isnt too long and its quite simple.  p  pIn order to save, I am writing to a text file the name of the currentRoom and each item in you.inventory.  Then when I load I am using readline to retrieve that data and reset the variables.  Ive got a game loop where I get the next command and perform whatever function matches the command.  When I wrote the following code for load, it wouldnt work correctly.  To test the saveload, I start the game pick up a few items and then go north to get into a position that is not the starting room, and save.  Then I quit, run the game again, enter the same name of course, and then give command load.  Note, the saved file is correct.  I even included a print statement in the load function that prints currentRoom.name, and its correct, but then when I call the look function and it does the exact same print currentRoom.name, Ive been moved back to the starting room  Interestingly, the inventory is loaded fine, just the location is wrong.  I cant figure it out for the life of me.p  pIn order to fix this, I had to move the load function into the game loop body, under elif com  load..., rather than calling it as a function, and then it works  I suspect Im doing something wrong with global vs local variables, but I cant see what.p  pHeres the code sorry for the indentation errors, cut and paste didnt work wellp  precodeclass Characterobject inventory  [] hitPoints  20 def initself, name     self.namename  class Roomobject   def initself, name, exits     self.namename     self.exitsexits     self.contents[]  class Itemobject   def initself, name, itemType, keyWords     self.name  name     self.itemType  itemType     self.keyWords  keyWords def reprself     return self.name Item types weapon1 one handed, weapon 2 2handed, head, body, hands, feet, arms,     legs, ring, necklace  I T E M S   sword1  ItemA short sword, weapon1, [sword1,sword,shortsword] sword1.roomDescription  A short sword made of steel lies here. sword1.description  It is a small sword of average quality, made of steel.  helmet1  ItemA metal helmet, head, [helmet1, helmet, metal] helmet1.roomDescription  A simple metal helmet sits on the ground. helmet1.description  Its a simple helmet with a few dings and dents, but otherwise     good condition.  coat1  ItemA leather coat, body, [coat1, coat, leather] coat1.roomDescription  A rugged leather coat lies crumpled at your feet. coat1.description  Its a thick leather coat.

Negative 1243 pWhen posting a push notification to the Notifications ListBar, the .contentText and the .number are initially not displayed .ticker, .icon and .contentTitle display fine. However, after posting another notification with a different ID, when the first one gets bumped down in the list, it then displays the content text and number. And then the new one is missing the text, and so on.p  pSince Im using the millisecond timer to create a unique ID, I dont think its possible for me to be somehow updating the previous post. So I must be posting it initially with something wrong such that somehow causes it to be missing the text until its no longer the most recent one.p  pThe problem only happens on some devices  mostly on nexus tablets running 4.2.2.

Negative 1243 pHave tried to resolve this issue but it is proving difficult. p  pI have two threads, one is a producer, and the other a consumer. All in separate classes. The two threads run independently. The producer is pooling about 812 folders for inputs. It then translates all the files concurrently and place in a shared folder called readyToLoad.  Once the producer thread finishes, the consumer threads now go into the readyToLoad folder and start processing the translated documents.p  pNow to the issue, while the consumer is processing the translated documents, it wouldnt allow the producer to put in more translated files into the readyToLoad folder. p  pMy question is, how do I prevent the consumer from locking the readyToLoad folder How can I manage this situation p  pApologies for the long text but I feel it will help understand where Im having issues.

Negative 1243 pI am facing the following scenariop  pMy application contains a lot of information stored in classes, the user can search the information for specific words similar to the file search in Windows.p  pOnce the user hit the search button, the search should begin asynchronously and collect results in the background.

Negative 1243 pWe were recently taught the concepts of error control coding  basic codes such as Hamming code, repeatition code etc.p  pI thought of trying out these concepts in MATLAB. My goal was to compare how an audio file plays when corrupted by noise and in the case when the file is protected by basic codes and then corrupted by noise.p  pSo I opened a small audio clip of 2030 seconds in MATLAB using audioread function. I used 16 bit encoded PCM wave file.  If opened in native format it is in int16 format . If not it opens in a double format.p  pI then added two types of noises to it   AWGN noise using double format and Binary Symmetric Channel noise by converting the int16 to uint16 and then by converting that to binary using dec2bin function. Reconverting back to the original int16 format does add a lot of noise to it.p  pNow my goal is to try out a basic repeatition code. So what I did was to convert the 2d audio file matrix which consists of binary data into a 3d matrix by adding redundancy. I used the following command  p  pcat3,x,x,x,x,x  p  pIt created a 3D matrix such that it had 5 versions of x along the 3rd dimension.p  pNow I wish to add noise to it using bsc function.  Then I wish to do the decoding of the redundant data by removing the repetition bits using a mode function on the vector which contains the redundant bits.p  pMy whole problem in this task is that MATLAB is taking too long to do the computation. I guess a 30 second file creates quite a big matrix so maybe its taking time. Moreover I suspect what I am doing is not the most efficient way to do it with regards to the various data types.p  pCan you suggest a way in which I may improve on the computation times. Are there some functions which can help do this basic task in a better way.p  pThanks. first post on this site with respect to MATLAB so bear with me if the posting format is not upto the mark.p  pEdit  posting the code here p  precode[x,Fs]  audioreadsample.wav,native  native loads it in int16 format , Fs of sample is 44 khz , size of x is 1796365x1 x1  x  minx  to make all values non negative s  dec2binx  this makes s as a 1796365x15 matrix the binary stream stored as character string of length 15. BSC channel needs double as the data type s1  doubles  48  to get 0s and 1s in double format codepre  p Now I wish to compare how noise affects s1 itself or to a matrix which is error control coded.p  precodes2  bscs,0.15  this adds errors with probability of 0.15 s3  cat3,s,s,s,s,s   the goal here is to add repetition redundancy. I will try out other efficient codes such as Hamming Code later. s4  bscs3,0.15 this step is taking forever and my PC is unresponsive because of this one. s5  modes4,,   i wish to know if this is a proper syntax, what I want to do is calculate mode along the 3rd dimension just to remove redundancy and thereby reduce error. codepre  p i will show what I did after s was corrupted by bsc errors in s2,p  precode d  chars2  48  d1  bin2decd  minx  soundd1,Fs  this plays the noisy file. I wish to do the same with error control coded matrix but as I said in a previous step it is highly unresponsive. codepre  pI suppose what is mostly wrong with my task is that I took a large sampling rate and hence the vector was very big.p

Negative 1243 pIm making a small quiz 5 questions where the user gets 1 to 5 points on a question. There are 5 answers per question so 5 buttons.p  pI dont want 5 different activities so I thought about changing the textview in buttons  the question when the user clickes on a random answerbutton. Every button has 1 to 5 points, but its always the same button. So for example if the first question he clicks on button1 it gives 1 point, but on the second question if he clicks on button 4 he gets 4 points. Makes sensep  pSo my problem is my if statements are not working and I dont know why. Its probably something really small, but its my first time programming for android so yeah. p  pWhats wrong with my code I dont got any errors.

Negative 1243 pIn my plot, a secondary x axis is used to display the value of another variable for some data. Now, the original axis is log scaled. Unfortunaltely, the twinned axis puts the ticks and the labels referring to the linear scale of the original axis and not as intended to the log scale. How can this be overcomep  pHere the code example that should put the ticks of the twinned axis in the same absolute axes position as the ones for the original axisp  precode    def convx         some conversion function          ...         return x2      ax  plt.subplot1,1,1     ax.setxscalelog       get the location of the ticks of ax     axlocs,axlabels  plt.xticks       twin axis and set limits as in ax     ax2  ax.twiny     ax2.setxlimax.getxlim      Set the ticks, should be set referring to the log scale of ax, but are set referring to the linear scale     ax2.setxticksaxlocs       put the converted labels     ax2.setxticklabelsmapconv,axlocs codepre  pAn alternative way would be the ticks are then not set in the same position, but that doesnt matterp  precode    from matplotlib.ticker import FuncFormatter      ax  plt.subplot1,1,1     ax.setxscalelog      ax2  ax.twiny     ax2.setxlimax.getxlim     ax2.xaxis.setmajorformatterFuncFormatterlambda x,posconvx   codepre  pBoth approaches work well as long as no log scale is used.  p  pPerhaps there exists an easy fix. Is there something I missed in the documentation p  pAs a workaround, I tried to obtain the ax.transAxes coordinates of the ticks of ax and put the ticks at the very same position in ax2.

Negative 1243 pIm writing an XNA program in C.p  pI have an my codeGamecode class, a class called codePlayercode and one called codeAttackcode. I when I construct attack within my Game class, I pass in the game instance as a parameter like thisp  pcodeAttack attackthiscodep  pIn Attack I have an instance of Player called codedefendercode. The Player class has a codegetDefenseCardGame gamecode method.p  pWithin Attack, I have a call to codedefender.getDefenseCardgamecode, where codegamecode is the same instance of Game I passed to Attack in the constructor.p  pWithin Players codegetDefenseCardGame gamecode I make a call to codegame.getCardcode, which is a method in my Game class that checks to see if the user has clicked on a card and if so, it returns the card clicked. This is accomplished by checking the position of the mouse and whether there was a click.p  pThe behaviour is looking for is that the card selected by the player will be returned all the way to Attack where it is processed. This is in fact the behaviour I get.p  pHowever there is one problem Im experiencing. I want to give the player the option to select no cards. To accomplish this I have created a codeCardcode object called codenoDefensecode as an attribute of the Game class and initialized it to a value. The plan is that when my attack object receives this particular card it will process a no defense response.p  pTo get this noDefense to the attack object I created a boolean value and a button. When the button is pressed, the boolean value is set to true. Within codegetCardcode, I first check to see if this boolean is true. If so I set it false and return the noDefense Card.p  pThe problem Im having is that while the button works and the codegetCardcode method does enter the if statement, the value that Players codegetDefenseCardcode receives when codegetCardcode returns is a codenullcode object. Which is baffling, because Im returning a nonnull Card object.p  pHere is a simplified code to make the whole situation a little less narrative and more demonstratedp  precodeclass Game  Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game      bool noDefenseSelected  false     Card noDefenseCard     Attack attack  new Attackthis     Button refuseDefense  new Button      protected override void Initialize              noDefenseCard  new Cardno defense         refuseDefense.onClick  noDefenseButtonClicked               protected override void UpdateGameTime gameTime              Attack.resolve           public Card getCard              if noDefenseSelected                      noDefenseSelected  false             return noDefenseCard                   if mouseNotOverCard                      return null                   if mouseNotClicked                      return null                   return getCardFromClick           public void noDefenseButtonClickedButton b              noDefenseSelected  true        class Player      public Card getDefenseCardGame game              return game.getCard        class Attack      Game game     Player defender  new Player      public AttackGame game              this.game  game           public void resolve              Card card  defender.getDefenseCardgame         if card  null                      dealWithDefenseCardcard                codepre  pAgain, the problem is that I do know for sure that the button works, codegetCardcode enters the first conditional, but for some reason it returns with codenullcode instead of codenoDefenseCardcode. If anybody could explain to me why that is and how to fix it, Id be grateful. Thank you.p

Negative 1243 pI have a Grails webapplication right now that uses SHA256 with unique salts to store the users password in my database. I recently upgraded the webapp to the most current version of the Spring Security plugin2.0RC2 for Grails2.3.4. The new plugin uses BCrypt by default. My question is, which one is better and why would they make the switch to BCrypt. Ive read articles on people who love BCrypt and people that hate BCrypt. One immediate pro I see is that salting is built into the algorithm, so I wouldnt have to store the salts separately. I also noticed that you can set the iterations on the SHA256. From what I read, a lot of people like BCrypt because you can set the iterations for it as well, but how does that differ from setting the iterations of SHA256 One blog said that PBKDF2 was a far superior choice because its been tested. But I also hear the same thing about BCrypt... p

Negative 1243 pMy question will be pertaining to something towards the aesthetic about the database I am designing.  I am not the most fluent in VBA and MS Access so please do redirect me if I am approaching this in a completely wrong manner.p  pIn the database, I have two sets of information that have a manymany relationship  Inspections and Pesticides.  I have 3 tables set up, tblInspections, tblPesticides, and tblPesticideInspections.p  pI use tblPesticideInspections as the source object for my subform under the main form for Inspections.  The subform is displayed as a datasheet since it is the most convenient.p  pNow, here is the aesthetic part  the only fields being recorded for the junction table are the PesticideID, BatchNumber, QuantityApplied, and Notes.  However, it is very useful to see Suggested DosageRates and the UnitOfMeasurement used for each pesticide based on the selected Pesticide.p  pI managed to find a way so that once they choose a pesticide, unbound textboxes display DosageRate and UnitOfMeasurement respectively, and the BatchNumber combo box is filtered to display only batches related to that specific pesticide.  However, this all works only when entering the first record in a subform.p  pIm not sure why DosageRate for subsequent records are autofilled, same for Unit, and the Batch filters.  Whenever I move on to the next record and pick a new Pesticide, both DosageRate and Unit change for all rows including the previously entered record, and Batch filter does update, however the previous entries get erased Im assuming because the previous entry is no longer in the current list of batches found as a result of a new query.p  pI hope my question makes some sense.  The following is the VBA code I am usingp  pPesticideID After Updatep  precodeDim DRate As String Dim Unit As String Dim PestID As Integer  PestID  MePesticideName  DRate  DLookup[DosageRate], tblPesticides, PesticideID  amp PestID amp   MeDosageRate  DRate  Unit  DLookup[Unit], tblPesticides, PesticideID  amp PestID amp   MeUnit  Unit  TempVars.Add PesticideIDUsed, PestID codepre  pThe tempvar PesticideIDUsed is what I use in a query criteria to filter Batches for the subforms combobox.p  pI understand that for DosageRate and Unit, displaying these are simply aesthetic and have no real effect on the databases functionality, but Batch does.  I really would appreciate any insighthelp on this issue.  Thank you for your time.p  pEDIT  I just checked this  the Batch Number after entering each record DOES get saved on the table itself, it just doesnt display properly on the form.  As in, say I enter a batch number for the first record, when I move on to the next record and pick a pesticide, the batch number for the last record disappears from view, however, it was already stored on the table.p

Is this realistic My space is of the order of a million entries.  My initial assumption is that this lead to collisions being very rare.

Negative 1243 pIve built a PHP personal profile based website that has a number of Category pages, each of which list a number of Profiles.p  pCategory page Lists profiles imagesnames in a gallerylike layout Profile page Shows indepth information about one personprofilep  pIm using a kindaMVCesque architecture here. So, when a visitor goes to a Profile page, the appropriate Controller asks the ProfileDataMapper to fetch the relevant profile. The ProfileDataMapper returns a fully formed Profile Domain Object to the Controller which then sends it to a Template View.p  pThe domain objects are all populated from arguments to their constructors, and have validation checks in them so that if any arguments are missing or bad, they will throw an error and not be instantiated.p  pThe problems start when I want to list a number of Profiles on a Category page. Here I am asking the DataMapper for an array of Profiles. But it is returning a list of whole complete Profile Objects when I know that in this case I only need perhaps a Name and URL. It is putting too much strain on the MySQL DB behind the mapper.p  pThe obvious solution would be to simple make the DataMapper pull just the few fields I really need for the list. But then my Domain Model validation tests would fail due to missing data they are expecting all fields.p  pSo now I am thinking I should create a new Domain model called PartialProfile or ListableProfile. This domain model would just have a nameurl and would only validate those two fields. The ProfileDataMapper would return PartialProfiles in its list method instead of Profiles. Maybe the Profile could even extend from PartialProfile.p  pIs this partial model a good way to go Or should I refactor my validation code somehow It seems to me I need different levels of validation.

Negative 1243 pI got an unknown algorithm that I need to calculate the time complexity for Big O. The only thing that I know about the algorithm is how long it takes to finish its calculations for a given number of values. Just to make it clear, the algorithm is taking a number and returning the time taken when using that number.p  pUsing the time taken and the numbers given for that time, I get a nearly straight line if I make a plot of the time taken against the numbers given. The line fits well to the complexity of codeOn log ncode. The problem is still that even if the line does fit, I cant prove that the complexity really is coden log ncode. so How can I prove the complexityp  pHere are some valuesp  precodetime 0.008  number of elements 4000 time 0.100  number of elements 40000 time 0.1200 number of elements 400000 time 1.4000 number of elements 4000000 codepre

Negative 1243 pI was working on my game today and I found that the top of my trees have a weird texture problem where they overlap each other with a black box.

Negative 1243 pI would like to start using boostrandom in a widely cross platform application.

Negative 1243 pThe answer probably differs depending on the OS, but Im curious how much stack space does a thread normally preallocate. For example, if I usep  precodepush rax codepre  pthat will put a value on the stack and increment the coderspcode. But what if I never use a codepushcode op I imagine some space still gets allocated, but how much Also, is this a fixed amount or is does it grow dynamically with the amount of stuff codepushcodeedp

Negative 1243 pI teach at a university and one assignment i have developed tests some quite specific modelling skill sets in Excel. Because of this, and because all assignments need to be fairly weighted, they end up having largely the same content in terms of the final code with different variables so that they are not exact copies  so it is fairly easy for students to take another persons completed file and input their own variables, change a few cosmetic items drag data locations, colours, borders etc and hand the work in as their own. i am confident that this is occurring and most of the time i can identify the suspects easily but proving the collusion not so much detecting it, this is difficult.p  pI am trying to work out how i can include somewhere on the worksheet which i will provide as a template a function that logs the user ID and time each incidence that the save button is pressed or at a set interval This way i can have this info logged in the background hopefully where nobody can find or goes looking for it and it will be quite easy for me to see if at any point along the way the student working on the sheet changed  indicating collusion. Of course there are other ways around this, and i am not looking for a fail safe system, just an easy way to catch lazy cheats.p  pI can find functions that save the last user to a cell, but none that can provide an ongoing log. Ideally, i would like it to be as covert as possible, i.e., avoiding obvious macros would be handy but i can understand this might be a problem.

Negative 1243 pI am using the extension Simple Configurable Products a hrefhttpsgithub.comorganicinternetmagentoconfigurablesimple relnofollowSCPa for Magento version 1.8.1.0p  pWhat I am trying to achieve is have a configurable product using SCP that displays the different options as radio buttons instead of a dropdown default. Eventhough this does sound quite easy, I couldnt find a proper solution so far there are a LOT of suggestions out there, none of which seems to work. I would love to solve this on the backend, even though I will at this point appreciate working frontend solutions just as much. p  pWhat does work in the configurable.phtml is spitting out the different custom options, set for the product, which looks something like thisp  precodeattribute  MagegetModeleavconfiggtgetAttributecatalogproduct, ATTRIBUTENAME              foreach attributegtgetSourcegtgetAllOptionstrue as option                  echo option[value] .   . option[label] . n              codepre  pI could imagine this to be a starting point, even though I havent thought it through.p  pWhat I can confirm as notworking, pluginwise are those twop  ul lia hrefhttpinchoo.netecommercemagentoconfigurableproductmodificationinmagento relnofollowInchoos plugina conflicts with SCPli lia hrefhttpwww.magentocommerce.commagentoconnectattributeicons.html relnofollowAttribute Iconsa is in beta state and doest work eitherli lia hrefhttpsgithub.comdbashyalMagentoConfigurableProductsRadioSelect relnofollowMagentoConfigurableProductsRadioSelecta does also not keep SCPFuncionalityli ul  pI know this is a very specific question and that it is a possible duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15507250magentohowtochangeconfigurabledropdownmenutoradiobuttonswhileusingsthisa, however there might even be working solutions for v1.7 that are not working anymore in v1.8 and I have a feeling that this might be highly interesting for many others.p  pstrongEditstrong Just to elaborate on what SCP does a little more It allows you to have a configurable product that can have dependencies between options. This works by having a single product for every possible option. This way you can for example have the price go up, depending on material and size of a product. So one size can have different prices depending on the material and then a new price range if the size goes up. The GitHub site also gives a better understanding, just in case this was way confusing.p  pIf you want to install SCP, make sure to install the fixes that are provided in the pull requests of the repo.p

Negative 1243 pI am currently making a game in SpriteKit and am using codeUILongPressGesturecode since I only want to recognize one touch at a time and want to handle both taps and swipes. The game plays fine but if the app is left or the device is put to sleep more consistently, this is when the app is put to sleep, upon returning to the game the action I specified for it in codeinitWithTargetactioncode is not being called at all if a finger slides around or a quick swipe is made.p  pIf I tap, it gets called.

Negative 1243 pI want to share my iOS native app screen to a web applicationfor ex an Applet and vice versa. I know that, sharing others iOS application screen is not allowed by apple, but we can share our own application screen. I want to do this programmatically. First approach can be sharing screenshot images from iOS native to web, i tested with a sample it worked. But, I have a problem with this. I cant do this sharing vice versa. i.e,  If i modify something on the web applet, that should reflect back to iOS native screen. For ex I have a text field in iOS native screen, which is shared to web applet. Lets say I type something in that text field on the applet end, later that value should reflect in iOS native as well. Sharing screen and values on both sides.p  pCould someone advise me or guide me how can I achieve this pleasep

Negative 1243 pFirst of all I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20069507solvedgattcallbackfailstoregisterSOLVED GATT callback fails to registera and took the steps suggested in that post to solve this issue with no success. The recommended fix in there if you havent read it is to make all BLE calls from the main thread directly or with a handler.p  pI am working on a BLE app want to run a service called from activity once every 10 seconds that performs these tasksp  precode1Gets list of our products available to connect to done, works  2For each available device            2aconnect to device           2bdiscover services           2cread 5 characteristics in this fashion              2c1read characteristic              2c2onCharacteristicRead parse data              2c3when finished with data read next characteristic              2c4repeat until all are read this is done using a state var and switch statement          2ddisconnect from device          2econnect to next device          2frepeat until all devices are read from          2gstopSelf codepre  pSo the issue... Everything works great for a little bit. I can perform the entire service start strongstartService... in mainActivitystrong to finish strongstopSelf in Servicestrong 6 times.p  pOn the 7th time I get BluetoothGatt Failed to register callback. Im not sure why I can run it 6 times successfully and then fail on the 7th time.p  pKeep in mind I am making all BLE calls from the main thread, and that has been confirmed in the log cat from multiple locations.p  pHere is an outline of my codep  pSERVICE.JAVAp  precodeprivate Handler handler  new Handler private BluetoothGatt cGatt  null private int unitIndex  0  keep track of currently connected unit private int state  0 used to keep track of which characteristic to read next  public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId       Log.iTAG, Service Started...     get ArrayList of units      ifunits.size gt 0         handler.postconnectNextRunnable calls connectNextDevice     else         stopSelf      private Runnable discoverServices  new Runnable      public void run              cGatt.discoverServices        private Runnable readNextValue  new Runnable      public void run              BluetoothGattCharacteristic c  null         switchstate                      set c to appropriate characteristic         default  all characteristics read             unitIndex             handler.postconnectNextRunnable             return                   cGatt.readCharacteristicc        private void connectNextDevice      ifunitIndex  0         store System.nanoTime in variable      ifunitIndex gt units.size finished will all units         stopSelf      ifunitIndex lt units.size         cGatt.disconnect if null         cGatt.connectGattthis, false, gattCallback   private BluetoothGattCallback gattCallback  new BluetoothGattCallback       public void onConnectionStateChange               handler.postdiscoverServices           public void onServicesDeiscovered               handler.postreadNextValue           public void onCharacteristicRead               ParseData           private void ParseData              do stuff with data         handler.postreadNextValue       codepre  pSo, like I have said, all BLE stuff is called from the main thread through a handler.

I have a basic outline in Pythonp  precodekey  [4,5,12,6,7,11,8,9,1,2,3,10] key  [4,5,6,7] letters  [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z] plaintext  IfyouarereadingthisthenthisplanetmayhavehopeafterallYouhavethepowerand plaintext  plaintext.upper keySpot  0 count  0 keyCount  0 letterLocation  0 tempLetter   i  0  whilecount lt lenplaintext     tempLetter  plaintext[count]     for i in range0, lenletters         iftempLetter  letters[i]             letterLocation  i         i  i  1      ifkeyCount gt 4     keyCount  0  letterLocation  letterLocation  key[keyCount] keyCount  keyCount  1  ifletterLocation gt 27     need some logic here so it wont go out of bounds  print letters[letterLocation] count  count  1 codepre  pMy main problem is what to do if letterLocation is too big when moving forward and gets past Z. When it gets to Z i need it to start over at A and keep going until done. For example If the plaintext letter was Y and the key was 5 Y would become D Y, Z, A, B, C, Dp  pHow can I do this Any help would be much appreciated, It can be in Java, C, C, JavaScript, or Python whatever is easiest. If you can come up with a better method Ill take advise. Thanksp

Negative 1243 pOkay Guys, just a little of a professional question here. p  pI am building a web application for a small company. The language I am using is java for a couple of reasons, one because it is my home language, two because of the amount of data and scalability that the application will need in the future. p  pMy question has nothing to do with my language choice but more with the implementation of a few ideas. I am building an appointments calendar, and current events table, as well as a Data Driven bar, bubble, and plot graph for the amount of traffic that current events are getting. p  pI will be using long polls to keep  the view current with the database. p  pMy question is in doing this should I build a class to take care of the query and just reload the entire page every N seconds to get the updated data, or should I build the long polling into the div using jstl sql query to keep the data current and only reload the div every N Seconds. p  pI understand if this is considered a weak question, but I am honestly learning this as I go and you guys have always been a great source of information. p  pSo Far I have tried passing to a servlet to reload a page instead of reloading directly on the page by just reloading the div, I like this approach because it allows me to separate out the processes and leave the web stuff with the web stuff and the data in the model, what I am not liking about this is that you can see the flicker of the page load when you update the information. p  pI havent tried the use of this technique in the calendar yet or with the bar graphs because honestly I have been racking ideas on how to approach the issue first, I want to try just refreshing the div instead of the entire page but if I am using a servlet to do that I wont be able to do so I will have to reload the entire page. I therefore would be using the jstl query tags to accomplish this, but I am not 100 sure that this is the practical and professional approach.p

Negative 1243 pIve read through many of the posts discussing the merits of using INNER JOIN vs WHERE.  The explanations I am finding all seem to suggest that the preference for INNER JOIN has more to do with readability than functionality.  However, I am experiencing huge differences in calculation time when applying the two methods to recalculate a geometry field.p  pIn the examples below, the pointgeoms.pointwithin field is a geometry type field of the same type and SRID as POINTS.geomp  pFor example, this WHERE version runs almost instantly on the subset of 5k recordsp  precodeUPDATE POINTS SET geom  pointgeoms.pointwithin FROM pointgeoms WHERE POINTS.POINTID  pointgeoms.pointid codepre  pWhile this INNER JOIN version will just keep spinning on and on, even when asked to only calculate a single rowp  precodeUPDATE POINTS SET geom  p.pointwithin FROM POINTS s INNER JOIN pointgeoms p ON s.POINTID  p.pointid codepre  pWhen I SELECT based on the very same INNER JOIN, it returns all 5k records in the subset rather quickly.. which confuses me more as to why the INNER JOIN update is just spinning on and on.  When I EXPLAIN the select version, it looks like its only scanning the 5k rows in the pointgeoms table, however when updating it looks like it wants to scan all 1M in the POINTS table.p  pAny thoughts  explanations would be greatly appreciated.

It works fine when I only have one div, or only one running at a time, but if I were to leave the region of one, and enter another before the other one finishes shrinking, it breaks.p  pHeres the JS amp jQuery code Im usingp  precodevar timers  [] var maxSize  150 var minSize  100 var step  1  function growelement      var size  element.width     if size lt maxSize          var newSize  size  step         if newSize gt maxSize newSize  maxSize         element.csswidth, newSize         element.cssheight, newSize      else          window.clearIntervaltimers[element]        function shrinkelement      var size  element.width     if size gt minSize          var newSize  size  step         if newSize lt minSize newSize  minSize         element.csswidth, newSize         element.cssheight, newSize      else          window.clearIntervaltimers[element]        function inArrayelement, array      if .inArrayelement, array gt 1 return true     return false   div.mouseoverfunction      var element  this     if inArrayelement, timers window.clearIntervaltimers[element]     else timers.pushelement      timers[element]  window.setIntervalfunction          growelement     , 0   div.mouseleavefunction      var element  this     window.clearIntervaltimers[element]     timers[element]  window.setIntervalfunction          shrinkelement     , 0  codepre  pSince Ive put the elements in an array, they shouldnt have a problem with multiple divs resizing at once, and Im not sure what Ive done wrong. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgsm7228w relnofollowAnd heres a JSFiddle of itap

Negative 1243 pRecently Ive decided to learn Java and give it a try. I have a short and amateur experience with python, therefore Im not a kind of programming expert. After many days trying to figure out how to set up Sublime Text to run and compile Java, Ive decided to come for any help.  Ive already installed JDK and I was using Netbeans, but I prefer a minimalistic IDE.  I created a .sublimebuild file like this below.. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQWPQ3.png altJava sublime.buildp  pHowever when I try to build the code, it returns me that error below.. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxhcGD.png altJava Errorp  pSo, probably Ive done something wrong, but I cant really figure out what it is. Im using Ubuntu 14.10 and thats the reason I cannot find many answers out there, so Id really appreciate if anyone could help me outp
Negative 1243 pI am working on a application where i need to show a user list. The user list is a custom list which have a imageview and textview. User image will be loaded in this imageview from server. I already worked with picasso library and which is really easy. I fetch the image url along with username from server using http request. Now the fact is as i need to use custom list i have implemented a custom adapter and in getView method i load the image using p  precodePicasso.withMainActivity.this.loadhttpi.imgur.comDvpvklR.png.intocontainer  codepre  pBut my now question is when i need to show 30 user in list then i need to fetch 30 user image by above code. I dont know is this best practice or other way to handle such list. Again i dont know this list may occupied user memory. What can i do knowp

Negative 1243 pI want to get a link to image resource in a MVC view that is part of an Orchard module. p  pGoogling a bit resulted in the following approachp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma92565153936440httpstackoverflow.coma92565153936440ap  pand its using codeHtml.ResourceUrlcode in views to get the resource URL. p  pI wonder where the codeResourceUrlcode comes from as its not documented in MSDN and i cannot use it in my projects either. p  pDid someone used that approach already and can shed some light on whats missing herep  pUpdatep  pI figured it out. The following code works in connection with Orchard modules.p  pFirst you need to add a resource manifest to the Orchard module like sop  precodepublic class ResourceManifest  Orchard.UI.Resources.IResourceManifestProvider    public void BuildManifestsOrchard.UI.Resources.ResourceManifestBuilder aBuilder        Orchard.UI.Resources.ResourceManifest lManifest  aBuilder.Add      string lModulePath  ModulesYourModuleName      lManifest.DefineResourceProfilePicture, User1.SetUrllModulePath  ImagesUser1.png     codepre  pThen you extend the Html objectp  precode This class adds so called extension methods to class System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper public static class HtmlHelperExtensions     This method retrieves the URL of a resource defined in ResourceManifest.cs via the Orchard resource management system   public static string ResourceUrlthis System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper aHtmlHelper, string aResourceType, string aResourceName         note       resolving Orchard.UI.Resources.IResourceManager via work context of orchard because          calling System.Web.Mvc.DependencyResolver.Current.GetService does not work as it always returns null at this point          constructor parameter injection is not allowed in static classes          setting the resource manager from another class that uses constructor parameter injection does not work as it causes a circular component dependency      Orchard.WorkContext lWorkContext  Orchard.Mvc.Html.HtmlHelperExtensions.GetWorkContextaHtmlHelper      Orchard.UI.Resources.IResourceManager lResourceManager  Orchard.UI.Resources.IResourceManagerlWorkContext.ResolveltOrchard.UI.Resources.IResourceManagergt     if lResourceManager  null            Orchard.UI.Resources.RequireSettings lSettings  new Orchard.UI.Resources.RequireSettings  Type  aResourceType, Name  aResourceName, BasePath  aResourceType         Orchard.UI.Resources.ResourceDefinition lResource  lResourceManager.FindResourcelSettings       if lResource  null                Orchard.UI.Resources.ResourceRequiredContext lContext  new Orchard.UI.Resources.ResourceRequiredContext  Resource  lResource, Settings  lSettings           string lAppBasePath  System.Web.HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath          return lContext.GetResourceUrllSettings, lAppBasePath                  return null     codepre  pand then you can write p  precodeltimg srcHtml.ResourceUrlProfilePicture, User1 gt codepre  pin an Orchard module view to get appropriate image link for User1.p  pI hope this helps.p

Negative 1243 pI need to send navigation commands using JButtons and the keyboard. If the Up buttonup key is pressed I need to send Move North command, if up and left buttons are pressedfrom keyboard, I need to send Move North West command etc.. The commands should be sent periodicallyevery 1 second. The following is the code I have.p  pTo explain more,p  pThere are three JButtons on the view. Lets call them jUp, jLeft and jRight. When the user presses the jUp button on the view, the program should send moveNorth commands periodically until the user releases the jUp button. When the user presses the up button on the keyboard, the same thing should happen, and the jUp button should look pressed until the user releases the keyboard up button.

Negative 1243 pI seem to be getting different results every time I run a PHP script.p  pOn Windows and Chrome, the script runs as it should. On Android Chrome, its almost as if the script is being ran twice before resulting in an error.

Negative 1243 pI have a very fundamental doubt about synchronization visavis the classic Servlet  Service  DAO pattern. p  pLets say I have a ticket booking application that is accessed by several concurrent users. No two users should end up booking the same ticket. When two different users try to access the ticket booking, I think the following happens p  ul lithe web container creates requestresponse objects for the two requests. Maps the request url to a servlet lets say, BookingServlet. li licreates threads for each request in order to run the service method of the BookingServlet.li lithe service  doPost method creates a BookingService object and passes the seat information.li liBookingService object does some business logic and instantiates the BookingDAO object to connect with DB and do the updates.li ul  pNow, in order to avoid two users booking the same ticket where must the synchronization happen p  pIs it at the BookingService or at the BookingDAO p  pBut then, and this is my doubt, for each request we are essentially creating a separate BookingService and BookingDAO objects  wouldnt that defeat the purpose of putting synchronized in therep

It turns out that test2 is rather easy to fixp  precodelet test2Async          async         let z  f          let x  5  z         let y  x  6         return y  3          codepre  pyou just need to type one async  , one  and one return.p  pBut if you do the same with test1, it will not compilep  precodelet test1AsyncWrong          async         let y                   let x                           let z  f  ERROR HERE we are not in a computation expression, so I cant use                          5  z                 x  6         return y  3          codepre  pHere is, as far as I know, what you really need to do to properly translate test1p  precodelet test1AsyncRight          async         let y                   async                 let x                           async                         let z  f                         return 5  z                                          return x  6                          return y  3          codepre  pNotice that I needed to type async strongthree timesstrong, plus  three times and return three times.p  pThis seems like an unnecessary and counterintuitive complication. It feels like there is something wrong. Translating code like that will take days if I have to do this.p  pAm I missing something Whats going on Thanks for any help.p
Negative 1243 pFor reasons unknown to me, the iPhone keyboard disappears emafterem the view segue is complete. So in order to remedy this, I tried to call coderesignFirstRespondercode in the function codeviewWillDisappearcode. I put my coderesignFirstRespondercode function and connected it with a button that initiates a segue. But still the keyboard disappears emafterem the view segue is complete.p  pI also would like to mention the view that is seguing before the keyboard disappears is an unwind segue. So that might be the source of the problem. But I am not a 100 percent sure.p  precodeIBOutlet weak var emailAddressTextField TextField IBOutlet weak var passwordTextField TextField  override func viewDidLoad      super.viewDidLoad     emailAddressTextField.becomeFirstResponder   IBAction func cancelButtonTappedsender AnyObject      resignFirstResponder   override func viewWillDisappearanimated Bool      resignFirstResponder  codepre  pSo anybody have a solution to this problemp

Negative 1243 pI am trying to create a filelevel backup solution using Cobian 11 on a Server 2008 R2 not a dc. I have some secured folders which are shared from the local machine to others on the network, and I am unable to back up those folders while accessing them locally. p  pIm running the backup as a service under a domain user account, which is a member of the local backup operators group. I thought backup operators were supposed to be able to access all files regardless of permissions. However, when I add the same account to other groups, it gains access to files, which are permitted for those groups. p  pI should also add that the backup does capture other files in other folders. I made a test folder, and I tried to back it up with different sets of permissions. By default, it allowed the local users group to access the files. With that permission, the backup operator was able to back up the test files. However, when I took that permission away, it failed.p  pEverything Ive read said backup operators are supposed to have access to all files regardless of permissions. So, Ill have to troubleshoot this problem. Is anyone aware of circumstances under which backup operators cannot access local filesp
