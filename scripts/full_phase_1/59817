Positive 59817 pI have a list of DownloadOperation in ObservableCollection and the variable has the property Progress.TotalBytesToReceive amp Progress.BytesReceived. When i tried to bind this property to max amp value of progress bar it gives me binding expression error property does not found. I bind other property ResultFile.Name and it success.

So I make a converter to retrieve the value.p  pHere is Convereter I use to convert the Progress property p  precodepublic class ByteReceivedConverterIValueConverter      public object Convertobject value, Type targetType, object parameter,      string language              BackgroundDownloadProgress bytes  BackgroundDownloadProgressvalue         if bytes.TotalBytesToReceive  0             return bytes.BytesReceivedbytes.TotalBytesToReceive100          else return 0           public object ConvertBackobject value, Type targetType, object parameter, string language              throw new NotImplementedException       codepre  pAnd is it possible to make this DownloadOperation has observability to the bytesreceived level, since I did not make this property, I just retrieve it from meta. Or am I doing it wrong because for now the problem i got is the view does not aware that the bytesreceived value is change.p  pIf its not possible should I make another viewmodel with INotifyPropertyChanged implemented p

Positive 59817 pSo Ive been working on a Win10 Universal App and wanted to create some live tiles for it. Im using the strongNotificationExtensionsstrong library for achieving this. However, I ran into a super weird behavior which doesnt make any sort of sense to me.

Whenever I step over the line where I want to set the text in my subclass, strongthe Text stays nullstrong. I initially thought this must be a problem with their implementation of the setter in the NotificationExtensions library, so I grabbed it and decompiled it.

Also, in the immediate window, everything seems to work just fine as well. I suspect its got something to do with the inheritance, but I have no idea what it could be.

Positive 59817 pIs there an alternative way to register your device in your Developer account I have so much problems with using the normal way, that is PhoneReg.exe. First of all, after downloading many, many different versions of the Windows Phone SDK and trying them all, I dont even have the PhoneReg.exe executable itself, which means I had to download it from a site. I downloaded the PhoneReg.exe and the DLL which comes with it. And with that I cannot register my device, it keeps saying that it couldnt connect. I have a Lumia 930.p  pIve tried everything.

Negative 59817 pWhat is the best solution for maintaining backup and revision control on live websitesp  pAs part of my job I work with several live websites. We need an efficient means of maintaining backups of the live folders over time.  Additionally, updating these sites can be a pain, especially if a change happens to break in the live environment for whatever reason.p  pWhat would be ideal would be hasslefree source control. I implemented SVN for a while which was great as a semisolution for backup as well as revision control easy reversion of temporary or breaking changes etc.p  pUnfortunately SVN places .SVN hidden directories everywhere which cause problems, especially when other developers make folder structure changes or copymove website directories.  Ive heard the argument that this is a matter of education etc. but the approach taken by SVN is simply not a practical solution for us.p  pI am thinking that maybe an incremental backup solution may be better.p  pOther possibilities includep  ol lia hrefhttpsvk.bestpractical.comviewHomePage relnofollowSVKa, which is commandline only which becomes a problem.  Besides, I am unsure on how appropriate this would be.li lipa hrefhttpwww.selenic.commercurialwiki relnofollowMercuriala, perhaps with some triggers to hide the distributed component which is not required in this case and would be unnecessarily complicated for other developers.  p  pI experimented briefly with Mercurial but couldnt find a nice way to have the repository seperate and kept constantly insync with the live folder working copy. Maybe as a source control solution making repository and live folder the same place combined with another backup solution this could be the way to go.  p  pOne downside of Mercurial is that it doesnt place empty folders under source control which is problematic for websites which often have empty folders as placeholder locations for file uploads etc.pli lia hrefhttpsamba.anu.edu.aursync relnofollowRsynca, which I havent really investigated.li ol  pId really appreciate your advice on the best way to maintain backups of live websites, ideally with an easy means of retrieving past versions quickly.p  pstrongAnswer repliesstrongp  ul lipemKibbeeem p  ul lipIts not so much about education as no familiarity with anything but VSS and a lack of timeeffort to learn anything else.  pli lipThe xcopy7zip approach sounds reasonable I guess but it would quickly take up a lot of room right  pli lipAs far as source control, I think Id like the source control to just say that this is the state of the folder now, Ill deal with that and if I cant match stuff up thats your fault, Ill just start new histories rather than fail hard.pli ulli lipemSteve Mem p  ul liYeah thats a nicer way of doing it but would require a significant cultural change.

Negative 59817 pSo, I want to upgrade my development team to VS2008. As an enterprise, we havent rolled out the 3.5 runtime yet.p  pFrom some reading, it seems like installing VS2008 will automatically give you .net 2.0 SP1, which has some new APIs, and when you target 2.0 runtime it will assume 2.0 SP1. p  pBut if SP1 is not rolled out to our users, this will lead to runtime breaks.p  ol liIs there anyway to have VS target dotnet 2.0 NOT SP1li liIs there any other solutions to this problem so developers dont use APIs that compile and run fine locally but blow up in productionli ol  pI see that fxcop has a check for this but there must be a more foolproof solution to this problem.p

Negative 59817 pI am writing a game, which need a map, and I want to store the map. The first thing I can think of, is using a 2Darray. But the problem is what data should I store in the 2Darray. The player can tap different place to have different reaction. So, I am thinking store a 2Darray with objects, when player click some position, and I find it in the array, and use the object in that array to execute a cmd. But I have a concern that storing lots of object may use lots of memory. So, I am think storing charint only. But it seems that not enough for me. I want to store the data like thatp  precode Type1 ColorGreen  codepre  pNo matter what color is, if they are all type 1, the have same reactions in logic, but the visual effect is based on the color.

Negative 59817 pI wrote a simple script to solve a logic puzzle, the type of puzzle from school where you are given a number of rules and then must be able to find the solution for problems like There are five musicians named A, B, C, D, and E playing in a concert, each plays one after the other... if A goes before B, and D is not last ... what is the order of who plays when etc.p  pTo evaluate possible solutions, I wrote each rule as a separate function which would evaluate if a possible solution represented simply as a list of strings is valid, for examplep  precodeFifth slot must be B or D def rule1solution     return solution[4]  B or solution[4]  D  There must be at least two spots between A and B def rule2solution     returns abssolution.indexA  solution.indexB gt 2  etc... codepre  pIm interested in finding the Pythonic way to test if a possible solution passes all such rules, with the ability to stop evaluating rules after the first has failed.p  pAt first I wrote the simplest possible thingp  precodedef isvalidsolution     return rule1solution and rule2solution and rule3solution and ... codepre  pBut this seemed rather ugly.

Negative 59817 pI need some expert advice. I need to model different user types for my web application and am not sure how to best model this. Basically the users for the application are therapists. Essentially there are the users of the application. So do I create a therapist tabledomain object and a therapistDAO, or do I keep a generic user tableuserDAO instead and use role typesnames instead It seems strange having a generic user table and DAO methods always referring to the userTable, when all queries will be against the therapist table. For example, a method to return all therapy types offered by a therapist will be findTherapyTypestherapist, therapistId. However, if I use user tables and User domain object the method would be the findTherapyTypesUser, userId which doesnt seem right. If I use a generic User domain object, then it will have a List of therapytypes which doesnt seem correct as it could in the future a different user type lets say Patient, and in this case the List of therapytyppes would always be null as it wouldnt apply.p  pIn the future there might be other user types, e.g. Patient or Customer those who leave feedback based on treatments received by therapistsp  pI will be using Hibernate so was thinking of using inheritance mapping for the user different user types having a therapist class extend a base User class and implement a User interface with common properties such as firstname, surname etc.p  pAny feedback would be much appreciated  p  pthanks Markp

For example, the read call seems to be systematically forwarded to the FUSE filesystem.p  pI work on a FUSE specific remote filesystem. I need a very agressive cache.p  pDo I need to implement my own page cache  Or is it possible to activate the Linux VFS cache for this particular FUSE filesystem  Or does someone know a good proxycache FUSE filesystem or a kind of C library to do that without reinventing the wheel p  pBonus question p  pIf I have to implement my own page cache, I think to use a REDIS daemon to do the LRU stuff.

Negative 59817 pIm a C game programmer with little web development experience.p  pI need to upload a small file 25100 or so bytes, depending on its content to a server. This is on the Windows Phone 7 using XNA. The target server is fairly limited and only supports PHP and classic ASP.p  pSince the CF on the WP7 only has access to a limited subset of networking commands, its looking like an HttpWebRequest GET aimed at a script that saves the file will be the best option. The data Im sending is small in size, and should be able to be passed as a parameter in the url.p  pIve been searching but have yet to find a complete example of this, which handles both the client and server side script mainly the latter. This is close to what Im looking for, except it has no mention of the server side script a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions566462uploadfileswithhttpwebrequestmultipartformdata567460567460Upload files with HTTPWebrequest multipartformdataa p  pThe closest that I got was this a hrefhttpwww.johny.org200708uploadusingcasclientandphpasserver relnofollowhttpwww.johny.org200708uploadusingcasclientandphpasserverap  pBut when attempting to use it I get an unhandled exception The remote server returned an error 405 Method Not Allowed. This method seems the most promising so far, but Ive yet to be able to debug this.p  pUnfortunately, I have a short amount of time to implement this, and as I said only a passing familiarity with web development.

Negative 59817 pBasically I have a standard WPF UI that has listboxes, checkboxes, listviews, etc but when I change them, it takes a while for the change to appear. For instance, say I refreshed the bindings, the UI display isnt updated immediately. It takes a second or so say for the check boxes to appear to be checked, or unchecked.p  pIs this a setting that can be turned offp  pOr is this because of Windows 7 Aero stuff I use Visual Studio 2010 but it doesnt seem to behave like that even though that is WPF too.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 59817 pI have a situation where I have several hundreds of complex excel spreadsheets, each with multiple pivot tables running queries against a sql database.  I need to be able to convert these sql queries into function calls against a proprietary data store.  This is complicated at many levels, but the part I am asking about now, and seems likely to have been addressed before in computer science, is how to parse the sql statements into a well defined structure that I can work with programmatically.p  pAn example of my starting pointp  precodeSELECT vwFlowDataBest.MeasurementDate, vwFlowDataBest.LocationType, vwFlowDataBest.ScheduledVolume, tblPoints.Zone, tblPoints.Name AS SOMEALIASFORNAME, vwFlowDataBest.PointID, tblCustomerType.Name, vwFlowDataBest.OperationallyAvailable, tblPoints.County, tblPoints.State, tblConnectingParty.Name  FROM Pipe2Pipe.dbo.tblConnectingParty tblConnectingParty, Pipe2Pipe.dbo.tblCustomerType tblCustomerType, Pipe2Pipe.dbo.tblPipelines tblPipelines, Pipe2Pipe.dbo.tblPoints tblPoints, Pipe2Pipe.dbo.vwFlowDataBest vwFlowDataBest  WHERE tblCustomerType.ID  tblPoints.CustomerTypeID AND tblPipelines.ID  vwFlowDataBest.PipelineID AND tblPoints.ID  vwFlowDataBest.PointID AND tblPoints.ConnectingPartyID  tblConnectingParty.ID AND tblPipelines.ID16 AND vwFlowDataBest.ScheduledVolumeltgt0 AND tblPoints.Zone In mid 1,mid 2,mid 3,mid 4,mid 5,mid 6,mid 7 AND tblCustomerType.ID16 AND vwFlowDataBest.MeasurementDategtts 20100515 000000 AND tblPipelines.IDlt155 codepre  pSo for this statement, I need to programatically handle the SELECT portion, the FROM portion, and the WHERE portion, and the subordinates within each.  Complications of this are things such as aliases, differentiating between a join between tables and a plain old value filter in the where clause, the grouping brackets within the where clause, and other issues.  Dealing with the complexities of Excel pivot tables is entirely outside the scope of this question, I can figure that out.p  pFor now, I dont mind strongnotstrong supporting certain sql functions, such as group by, having, etc...for my problem, those are small enough that if necessary I can handle those manually.  But if theres a known way to handle that as well, Id be most happy.p  pMy feeling is that I can probably get 70 of the way there for my problem just by splitting the sql statement into 3 parts, and then further breaking each of those down into their logical subordinate parts and then deal with them accordingly.  But as I write this I can already see holes in my plan...this feels like a tarpit of complexity and edge cases.p  pI cant imagine Im the first person to want to do such a thing, so my question is, are there old, proven approaches to this sort of problem, existing libraries, innovative approaches I could take, or any suggestions in general to apply to this taskp

Now every subsequent zoom level magnifies by a level of 2 so I half the meters per pixel for every zoom level. I do this until I have a zoom level where strongmeters per pixelstrong multiplied by the strongscreen widthstrong gives me less than 2000 i.e 2 Km across.p  pBut I dont think that the zoom level I am getting is showing the map of 2Km radius.

Negative 59817 pI am a bit stuck with this. I want to determine two opacity int values. One should increase and the other should decrease by hour.p  pImagine a day consists of 4 parts.

That being said, all the configuration for my TPT tables are being handled in the codeEntityTypeConfigurationltSomeEntityClassgtcode classes.p  pWhen I define a TPT relationship by creating a new class which derives from another, the codeON DELETE CASCADEcode does not get generated in the SQL constraint, which is the problem.p  pHave a look at the following code...p  precode  public class Person          public int PersonId  get set        public string Name  get set        public class OtherPerson  Person          public string SomeOtherProperty  get set        public class PersonMap  System.Data.Entity.ModelConfiguration.EntityTypeConfigurationltPersongt          public PersonMap                  this.HasKeyt gt t.PersonId  Primary Key            this.Propertyt gt t.PersonId               .HasColumnNamePersonId  Explicitly set column name               .IsRequired  Field is required  NOT NULL               .HasDatabaseGeneratedOptionDatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity  Specify as Identity Not necessary, but Im explicit            this.Propertyt gt t.Name               .HasColumnNameName  Explicitly set column name               .IsRequired  Field is required  NOT NULL               .HasMaxLength50  Max Length            this.ToTablePeople  Map to table name People            public class OtherPersonMap  System.Data.Entity.ModelConfiguration.EntityTypeConfigurationltOtherPersongt      public OtherPersonMap              this.Propertyt gt t.SomeOtherProperty             .HasColumnNameSomeOtherProperty  Explicitly set column name             .IsRequired  Field is required  NOT NULL             .HasMaxLength10  Max Length          this.ToTableOtherPeople  Map to table name OtherPeople                                        This also causes TPT to create a shared primary key from the base table                                        and double serving as a foreign key to base table.                                             codepre  pThe above code is really simple. I have 2 types and they are correctly create in the database. If I create a new codeOtherPersoncode and save to the database it correctly creates 2 records, 1st a record in the codePeoplecode table and another in the codeOtherPeoplecode table with a shared primary key which is also the foreign key from OtherPeople to People.  Now, the DbContext or EF rather, correctly deletes both records if I delete the OtherPerson within my code. However, should I delete the record directly from the database, an orphan record is left behind in the codePeoplecode table.p  pstrongSo, how do I get the codeON DELETE CASCADEcode to be specified for the foreign key constraints generated for base tables using the fluent apistrongp  pSorry the question is so long but I just wanted to describe the best I could my problem. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 59817 pIm dealing with two internal web servers, one running Apache2 on Ubuntu Server 10.04, and the other IIS on Windows Server 2008.  When I hit either of the root URLs from a web browser with a cleared cache, calling the server by IP address, both pop up with no delay.  I also see no delays browsing sites on either server.  However, when I call the same addresses using codeurllib2code in Python, each request to the Apache2 server is delayed by 4.5 to 5 seconds.  The IIS server responds in less than 0.02.p  pHere is a script I ran to verify the problem.  I set the UserAgent in case it makes a difference, but it doesnt appear top  precodeimport urllib2 from time import time  apacheserver  http192.168.1.101 iisserver  http192.168.1.102  headers  UserAgent  Mozilla5.0 X11 U Linux i586 de rv5.0 Gecko20100101 Firefox5.0,  printContacting Apache2 server... request  urllib2.Requesturlapacheserver, headersheaders start  time response  urllib2.urlopenrequest.read elapsed  time  start printElapsed time 0.formatelapsed  printContacting IIS server... request  urllib2.Requesturliisserver, headersheaders start  time response  urllib2.urlopenrequest.read elapsed  time  start printElapsed time 0.formatelapsed codepre  pResultsp  precodegtpython urltest.py Contacting Apache2 server...

I dont know if anything else could be triggering a lookup.p  hr  pemUpdateem I followed the exchange with Wireshark, and found three failed NBNS queries going from my machine to the Apache2 server before they finally start talking. This accounted for the lost time.  I tried adding an entry in codehostscode for the web server, which eliminated the delay.p  pIm not adding this as an answer because I still dont know why the lookup attempt is happening, or why I dont see the same behavior from the web browser.  I just have a workaround for whatever mistake Im making.p

Negative 59817 pIm having problems using Bulk Bind in PLSQL. Basically what I want is for a tableComponent to update its fieldvalue dependent on the Componentid and fieldname. All of these are passed in as paramaters the type varchar2nestedtable is effectively and array of strings, one element for each update statement that needs to occur. So for instance if Componentid  Compid1 and fieldname  name then fieldvalue should be updated to be new component name. p  pI typed up the code below in relation to this a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkissuearchiveo14techplsqll2091157.html relnofollowhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkissuearchiveo14techplsqll2091157.htmla . The code works but is no faster than a simple loop that performs an update for every element in the IN parameters. So if the parameters have 1000 elements then 1000 update statements will be executed. I also realise Im not using BULK COLLECT INTO but I didnt think I needed it as I dont need to select anything from the database, just update.p  pAt the moment both take 45 seconds for 1000 updates. I assume Im using the bulk bind incorrectly or have a misunderstanding of the subject as in examples I can find people are executing 50,000 rows in 2 seconds etc. From what I understand FORALL should improve performance by reducing the number of context switches. I have tried another method I found online using cursors and bulk binds but had the same outcome. Perhaps my performance expectations are too much I dont think so from seeing others results.

Negative 59817 pIm using MySQL db.p  pI want to dump a set of rows from one table and if these rows have foriegn keys that point to rows on some other tables, I want to dump those too.p  pThen I want to load these dumps into their respective tables on a different database e.g using LOAD DATA INFILE command. So simply using codeselect...join...into outfilecode is not enough since the result would be one big joined table. p  pFor example table A has Bid and Cid columns that point to rows on table B and C respectively.

Negative 59817 pIn a python testframework we interface with a tcl API for spirent testcenter through Tkinter. This spirent testcenter API is only available in 32 bit, which means that our tcl interpreter needs to be 32 bit. We steer the tcl API using Tkinter from python. I am aware recently a python driver was released for testcenter, but this is also 32 bit only. Because Tkinter is integrated in python, the python installation also needs to be 32 bit.p  pI would like to run this framework on a CentOS x8664 workstation. I have managed to install the testcenter driver, ActiveTcl and python all in 32 bit and this works. However, the testframework is also dependent on a number of python packages e.g. numpy, which also need to be built in 32 bit to be able to use them. I cannot figure out how to build these packages in 32 bit however. I have tried passing compiler option m32 to the distutils build command i.e. python setup.py build but this is happily ignored. There seems to be a p option to pass the platform, but this only works on windows. I have also looked into using a 32 bit only compiler but distutils seems to have a static list of available compilers, and only the intel compiler i.e. commercial... is 32 bit only I believe.p  pDoes anybody have a brilliant idea on how to build python modules in 32 bit on a 64 bit linux architecture, or how to build python itself in 64 bit so that the package installation is easy, yet integrate tcltk in 32 bitp  pCheers.p  pWimp

Negative 59817 pIn my application I have a glsurfaceview that in previous versions behaved fine but in the newest version I allow for orientation changes and that kills the view. I can see in the logcat that it starts back up and all my lights and everything get recreated but the view does not render any of the objects. p  pSo how can I get my glsurfaceview to start drawing again after onPause gets called from an orientation change. Ive been researching this all day with no real good leads except for a link that explains how to rebuild the glsurfaceview class which I definitely do not want to do.

Negative 59817 pOk maybe I am missing something here, but I am stuck for hours. I make an app where the user paints a dimension line over a picture. Now I want to paint also some selection points that show that the line is selected.

I have created a class DrawSelectionPoint that extends View and I can rotate the bitmap with something like thisp  pselectionPoint  BitmapFactory.decodeResourcecontext.getResources,                     R.drawable.selectionpoint Matrix matrix  new Matrix         matrix.postRotatefloatMath.toDegreesanglebr canvas.drawBitmapselectionPoint, matrix, nullp  pwhere angle is the angle of the line this way my bitmap is rotated the way I want it but it is painted on point 0,0 top left of the screen.p  pIf I use something like p  pcanvas.savep  pcanvas.rotatep  pcanvas.drawBitmapselectionPoint, x, y, nullp  pcanvas.restore p  pthen I find it too hard to draw the bitmap at the exact location I want since I draw on a rotated canvas, which I rotate back afterwards. I tried some Euclidean rotation transformations but I had no luck.p  pIs there some way to apply the matrix rotation and also give the points where I need the bitmap to be drawn Thank you in advancep

Negative 59817 pI am trying to create a simple interactive form for use with touch screen devices. The majority of the form is made up of radio buttons in groups of 5 approx. 37 groups.

E.g. A user selected radio button A in group 1, then changes their selection to radio button B in group 1. At the moment, both label backgrounds will be changed to the defined colour. p  pThe HTML form is created dynamically by PHP so radio button names, IDs, amp values will differ.p  pI have been unsuccessful trying to complete this task myself, and there doesnt seem to be a simple codeOnUnClickxxxcode either.

Negative 59817 pI have an XML layout that has a google map, two text views, and a button in a relative layout. The text views are below the google map with the text values Latitude and Longitude that get updated to Latitudexxx and Longitudexxx when the user moves the cursor on the map. The submit button says Submit and does just that, it packages latlon in an intent and passes it to the next activity.p  pThis was all fine until I started messing with the layout. I noticed that because I had lazily been using the Graphical design tool in eclipse, everything had set dimensions, meaning on bigger screens it looked silly.p  pI added another relative layout and placed the latlong texts and the submit button into it, and placed the new layout under the other relative layout that now only has the MapView. p  pMy intent was to use androidlayoutweight to assign the bottom relative layout around 15 or so of the screen on the botton, and the rest of the screen would be the google map. p  pPhysically the dimensions were fine. However if I had the textviews dependant on the submit button at all androidlayoutabovebelow, the submit buttons text would take on the value of the textview dependant on it and would get updated, while the textview would be stuck at latlong and would not get updated.p  pI currently have the textviews just set at the top of the relative layout and the independent submit button on the bottom and it works fine.

Negative 59817 pThis is a question about how Java does reflection internally.p  pI have a abstract class sayp  precodeSuperClass codepre  pand two chlid classes from SuperClass,p  pcodeChildClass1code and codeChildClass2code.p  pcodeSuperClasscode defines a accesor method codegetValuecode although it dosent define the attribute value.p  pcodeChildClass1code and codeChildClass2code override the method codegetValuecode and both add an annotation codeMyAnnotationcode to the method, codeMyAnnotationcode is kept in runtime Its the codeOneToOnecode annotation.p  pIn my program I have an instance of codeChildClas1code and an instance of codeChildClass2code. I used reflection to obtain all methods from both objects.p  pAs expected I got two codegetValuecode methods in the resulting array, one for the codeSuperClasscode and one for the codeChildClasscode.p  pFor the instances of codeChildClass1code the codegetValuecode method that had codeMyAnnotationcode was marked as a accessor methodAccessor property  null but for instances of codeChildClass2code the method marked as an accessor didnt have the annotation was the codegetValuecode method of the parent class.p  pI couldnt understand why, eventually I changed the order in which methods were declared in codeChildClass2code There were more methods than just the accessors, namely I put all getters and setters at the begginging and codeChildClass2code was behaving as codeChildClass1code.p  pMy question is, stronghow does Java qualify methods as accessors in reflectionstrong, and further does the order in which methods are declared change the behavior of reflectionp

Negative 59817 pI am using LibGDX for a small app project, and I need to somehow take a series of sprites and place them or their pixels rather into a Pixmap.  The basic idea is to take random sprites that are generated through various means while the app is running, and, only at specific times, merge some of them onto a single background sprite.p  pI believe that most of this can be done easily, but the step of getting the sprite images into the Pixmap isnt quite so obvious to me.  The sprites also have various transparent and semitransparent pixels, so simply grabbing the color at each pixel while it is all on the same screen isnt really applicable either, as it obviously shouldnt take the background colors with it.p  pIf there is a suitable alternative to this that would accomplish what I am looking for I would also love to hear it.  Any help is highly appreciated.p

Negative 59817 pWith the fantastic help of Tim on this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11596697controllingandroidappwithbluetoothmousepresenterControlling Android app with bluetooth mouse presentera I added bluetooth remote control of my application.

Negative 59817 pI am implementing autocomplete in a WPF ComboBox. Every time a new character is input in the combo, I want to have a database lookup getting items to populate the combo with.

The replacement char will not be selected. If I add a character to that, the text box will be cleared but a correct search for a string using those two characters will be performed.

Negative 59817 pI have a Firebird DB.  For most of my tables I have a trigger which fires before insert which will create the Primary Key PK for me via a generator as well as write to the newly inserted records a Created Date value and a Created By value.  I also have an update trigger which writes to an Updated Date field and an Updated By field.p  peg Client is a table in my DBp  precodecreate trigger tclientid for client active before insert as begin   new.clientid  genidgenclientid, 1   new.created  currenttimestamp   new.createdby  currentuser   new.lockvn  1 end   create trigger tclientupdate for client active before update as begin   new.updated  currenttimestamp   new.updatedby  currentuser end     codepre  pWhen I apply updates thru my ClientDataSet CDS  which are attached to remote TDataSetProviders via a TDSProviderConnection, how can I retrieve these generated values  If I edit an existing one which will in turn call the tclientupdate trigger, calling RefreshRecord will get the updated and updatedby fields.  However, the Doco says to use that method cautiously, so that may not be the correct way to achieve this.  I call it straight after Ive called ApplyUpdates1.p  pThe CDS I use only contains the one record I am attempting to Edit.  For a New record, the CDS is in dsInsert mode.  Everything is written to the DB ok so I just need to get this new data back out again.  I have also tried using a CDS which contains ALL records in the table too to see if it was any simpler but didnt make any difference  unsurprisingly.  The reason I need this information is simply to show to the user in DB Aware controls these values.  They are read only.p  pI could call a Get on the record I guess when editing an existing record, using the PK, but that wont help for an Insert as I dont know what the new PK is.  p  pExample of where I attempt to ApplyUpdates to my CDS actDSSave is a TDataSetPost actionp  precode  dsState  actDSSave.DataSource.DataSet.State   DoApplyUpdates1   if dsState  dsEdit then     TClientDataSetactDSSave.DataSource.DataSet.RefreshRecord codepre  pI am using TIBQuery for my dataset attached to the remote DataSetProvider.  This query SQL is a simple strongselect  from client where clientid  clientidstrong.  I have tried associating this query with a TIBUpdateSQL too as well as trying to set poAutoRefresh to true in the DataSetProvider.p  pSo is it possible to obtain these Trigger generated values this way or do I need to approach it in a different way Another way I can think of, is to create stored procedures which do CRUD against each table and use that instead with appropriate inout params to return this new data but hopefully I dont have to go down that track. Hopefully I have provided sufficient info here to explain and replicate the issue.  p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong Realised in above, DoApplyUpdates1 is my own method.

Negative 59817 pIm currently designing a database model and Ive come across an issue, where Id like some more input on whats considered the proper way of doing things.p  pIn the example below I have two tables, Persons and Roles. Now 1 person may be assigned 0 or more roles. This is pretty straight forward with a manytomany relationship, but the tricky part comes when you want to allow the user to select which role he is currently operating as.p  pSay the user got a selection of 5 roles to choose from, and depending on which role he currently has chosen, the application will present him with different views  menus  buttons  etc. p  pI see two solutions herep  p1 See top part of image linked belowp  pIn the persons table, you include a nullable FK to the manytomany relationship the association entity.p  pFrom Wikipedia on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAssociativeEntities relnofollowAssociative entityap  pIt seems ok for other entities to reference this relationship. Im just not entirely sure if this includes the Roles and Persons entities.p  pWhat I like about this design is that its pretty easy to get a list of all allowed roles for a person, and then you simply point to one of those allowed roles, saying youre the currentactive one.

Negative 59817 pBefore starting implementation of solution for my problem I just want to be sure if I will not reinvent wheel and if I can reuse work that someone have done before. So my problem isp  pI have made image matcher using OpenCV library. This matcher receives a set of image files and trying to find similar images in database. At the end it returns statistical results according to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiReceiveroperatingcharacteristic relnofollowROC Curvesa definition True Positive, True Negative, False Positive and False Negative number of matches. These results can vary because of OpenCVs library algorithm parameters values, which are about 10. This means that parameters adjustment will bring to more True Positive matches and to less False Positive matches. As I have to adjust more or less 10 parameters, brute force adjuster will be very slowly. By brute force I meanp  precodeWhileparam1 lt 50   Whileparam2 lt 50     Whileparam3 lt 50              PerformMatching       param3 2          param2      pram1 5  codepre  pWhat I want to do is to choose parameters randomly and then analyze if statistical results are becoming better. Then this analysis will help to alter method which is randomly generates parameters in order to choose better parameters. p  pSo my question is if there is library in Java or if there is any AI algorithm, which will return better parameter set based on evaluation of True Positive and False Positive valuesp  pCould appreciate some help, thanks.p

I use a dictionary to count each words occurrence. The style is roughly based on the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMapReduceMapReducea programming model. As you can see, each task is using its own private dictionary. So, there is NO shared variables just a bunch of tasks that count words by themselves. Here is the output when the code is run on a quadcore i7 CPUp  pParallel  000001.6220927br Serial  000002.0471171p  pThe speedup is about 1.25 which means a tragedy But when I add some delay when processing each line, I can reach speedup values about 4.p  pIn the original parallel execution with no delay, CPUs utilization hardly reaches to 30 and therefore the speedup is not promising. But, when we add some delay, CPUs utilization reaches to 97.p  pFirstly, I thought the cause is the IObound nature of the program but I think inserting into a dictionary is to some extent CPU intensive and it seems logical because all of the threads are reading data from a shared memory bus. However, The surprising point is when I run 4 instances of serial programs with no delays simultaneously, CPUs utilization reaches to about raises and all of the four instances finish in about 2.3 secondsp  pThis means that when the code is being run in a multiprocessing configuration, it reaches to a speedup value about 3.5 but when it is being run in multithreading config, the speedup is about 1.25. p  pWhat is your idea Is there anything wrong about my code Because I think there is no shared data at all and I think the code shall not experience any contentions. Is there a flaw in .NETs runtime     p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 59817 pIm really torn on what to do on this one.  For the past 10 years Ive just put up with this but I think its time to decide the right way to handle this issue.p  pAccording to the internet, MySQL doesnt support a native datatype, which makes sense why whenever I choose BOOLEAN I see the column end up as a tinyint1.  p  pI have no problem with storing data as a tinyint with a 1 or 0 value, however I do have a problem with the fact that when I select many rows from the database with this column I get a string 1 or 0 instead of a PHP native bool truefalse.  PHP can still deal with this variable as a boolean value of course as it seems to automatically know what I want it to do whenever I do  0 or  1 or even  0 or  1 if Im really feeling up to it.p  pSo, here I go, taking this data and running it into PHPs codejsonencodecode function and outputting it when my BackboneHandlebars implementation makes an ajax call, and getting a nice beautiful JSON object usually with many rows data in it with this codemyVariable1code or this codemyVariable0code.p  pIm sure you can see the issue with wanting to do something like this in Handlebars.jsp  precodeif myVariable      Do this else     Do that if codepre  pNow, what I really DONT want to do is something like thisp  precodeltphp fori  0 i lt countrecordSet i      recordSet[i][myVariable]  boolrecordSet[i][myVariable]  gt codepre  pBeing that the application Im building has thousands of columns in the database I cant or just should need to just run the above code for every column I want to have act like a bool in my javascript.

Right now there are 2 options for the PRIMARY KEY for the TIMESHEET table.p  h2Option 1h2  pChoose an autogenerated PRIMARY KEY. We have chosen this approach currently. TIMESHEETID is an autogenerated INT type PRIMARY KEY.  p  h2Option 2h2  pWe do not need the TIMESHEETID. The EMPLOYEEID together with the WEEKSTARTDATE and WEEKENDDATE can uniquely identify any row in the TIMESHEET table. But I feel it does not meet the criteria of being simple.p  pWhich option is better for the TIMESHEET table and why p  pFor the TIMESHEETDETAIL table the composite PRIMARY KEY currently consists of  code TIMESHEETID, DATE, PROJECTID, TASKID code. If we do not have the autogenerated PRIMARY KEY in the TIMESHEET table then we will only be having code DATE, PROJECTID, TASKID code as the  PRIMARY KEY for the TIMESHEETDETAIL table.p  pIs there any better alternatives p

Negative 59817 pLately I have been trying to create my own PHP framework, just to learn from it As we may look into some bigger and more robust framework for production. One design concept I currently have, is that most core classes mainly work on static functions within classes.p  pNow a few days ago, Ive seen a few articles about Static methods are death to testability. This concerned me as.. yeah.. my classes contain mostly static methods.. The main reason I was using static methods is that a lot of classes would never need more than one instance, and static methods are easy to approach in the global scope. Now Im aware that static methods arent actually the best way to do things, Im looking for a better alternative.p  pImagine the following code to get a config itemp  precodetestcfg  Configgettest  Gets config from test echo testcfggtfoo  Would output what foo contains ofcourse.     We cache the newly created instance of the test config,   so if we need to use it again anywhere in the application,   the Configget method simply returns that instance.   codepre  pThis is an example of what I currently have. But according to some articles, this is bad. br Now, I could do this the way how, for example, CodeIgniter does this, usingp  precodetestcfg  thisgtconfiggtgettest echo testcfggtfoo codepre  pPersonally, I find this harder to read. Thats why I would prefer another way.p  pstrongSo in shortstrong, I guess I need a better approach to my classes. I would not want more than one instance to the config class, maintain readability and have easy access to the class. Any ideasp  pNote that Im looking for some best practice or something including a code sample, not some random ideas. Also, if Im bound to a thisclassmethod style pattern, then would I implement this efficientlyp
Negative 59817 pTo make this clear, Im using .net 3.5p  pIm currently creating an Visual Studio Visualizer in order to be able to see the values of individual rules in a WF RuleSet. Everything is ok, but now I need to do the following.p  pLets say I have a rule which is this.Age  50 and one then action as MessageBox.ShowBigger than 50 and one else action as MessageBox.ShowLess than 50p  pI need to be able to select the rule this.Age  50 and evaluate it as true or false. Or I need to select part of the rule, eg. this.Age and evaluate it to lets say 70.p  pThis last bit is working. Im getting the object in which the RuleSet executes and getting the fileds and try to find one field named Age and if I do find, I get its value, on the event of not finding the field I then look at properties. This is working.p  pThe problem is evaluating this.Age  50. Of course, I could do a parser in this case and evaluate it, but the problem is then I would have to evaluate this.Age  50, this.Age lt 50... I guess you understand the problem. And of course I also want to evaluate for example, this.GetCurrentAge, in which GetCurrentAge is a method in the class represented by the object in which context the RuleSet executes.p  pIve thought I could try to inject a method at runtime into the object I currently have and which is instantiated. This way, I could create something as simples asp  precodepublic string EvaluationMethod  return this.Age gt 50.ToString  codepre  pin this case, I would at runtime build this method and inject it in the current instance of object.p  pThe problem is that I cant seem to find a way to inject code into the current instance of the object. I can only find examples on how to create new classes at runtime, but nothing about only creating a method and inject it.p  pCan someone please help, or give any other ideap  pThanksp
Negative 59817 pIm using bottle to write a very simple backend API that will allow me to check up on an ongoing process remotely. Im the only person who will ever use this serviceor rather, I emwould very much likeem to be the only person to use this service. Its a very simple RESTish API that will accept GET requests on a few endpoints.p  pIve never really done any development for the web, and I wanted to do something as simple as is reasonable. Even this is probably an undue level of caution. Anyway, my veryverybasic idea was to use https on the server, and to authenticate with basically a hardcoded passkey. It would be stored in plaintext on the server and the client, but if anyone has access to either of those then I have a different problem.p  pIs there anything glaringly wrong about this approachp

Negative 59817 pIm using Opencv 2.4.5 with python 2.7 to track people in video surveillance. At the beginning I used .avi and .mpeg videos to test my code, now I want to use a hcvm100c camera. I am using a simple difference between frames an initial frame compared with each frame to identify the objects in movement, It works very well with the .avi and .mpeg videos I have, but when I use the camera the results are so bad because a lot of noise and stains appear in my video. I thought that the problem was my camera, but I made an .avi video with the same camera and I tested that video with my code and it works fine.  Now, Im using the cv2.BackgroundSubtractorMOG but the problem is still there. So, I think I need to do a preprocessing when I use the camerap

Negative 59817 pIve spent the last two days working on this problem. Most of the content Ive found on this topic doesnt address the issue Im having, so Im hopeful that someone here can help me. p  pIve been working on some code that does the following from a master scorecard workbookp  ol liTakes each student sheet in the workbook and copies the sheet into a new workbook,li liDoes a few minor manipulations of the new workbook,li liImports a module of code into the new workbook,li liAdds a codeWorkbookOpencode event and a codeWorkbookBeforeClosecode event to the new workbook to make certain sheets codexlVeryHiddencode depending on level of access,li liRuns a subprocedure from the newly imported module,li liSaves and closes the workbook.li ol  pEach scorecard uses code to ensure that only the person whose name is on the scorecard can access it. Ive used codeEnvironusernamecode in the workbook events to ensure security, but as you well know, if one and understands how to run macros, heshe could merely open the codeVBEditorcode and unhide the codexlVeryHiddencode sheets in the workbook very easily. p  pSo, my thought was to password protect the new workbooks codeVBAProjectcode programmatically see above step number five. I found a few sources online of how to use codeSendKeyscode to achieve this goal see below, but codeSendKeyscode is unreliable at best and isnt cooperating with my code. The code works like a charm if I run it by itself, but if I call it from another project using codeRun Macrofilenamemacronamecode it doesnt set the protection. After the code has run and all the workbooks have been created, the codeVBAProjectcode properties windows from the earlier code are all open and try to execute at the same time which crashes Excel. p  precodeSub LockVBAProject  Const VBAProjectPassword As String  123 Dim VBP As VBProject, openWin As VBIDE.Window Dim wbActive As Workbook Dim i As Integer     Set wbActive  ActiveWorkbook     Set VBP  wbActive.VBProject     Application.ScreenUpdating  False          close any code windows to ensure we hit the right project         For Each openWin In VBP.VBE.Windows             If InStropenWin.Caption,  gt 0 Then openWin.Close         Next openWin         wbActive.Activate With Application     execute the controls to lock the project     .VBE.CommandBarsMenu Bar.ControlsTools          .ControlsVBAProject Properties....Execute     activate protection     .SendKeys TAB     CAUTION this either checks OR UNchecks the     Lock Project for Viewing checkbox, if its already     been locked for viewing, then this will UNlock it     .SendKeys       enter password     .SendKeys TAB amp VBAProjectPassword     confirm password     .SendKeys TAB amp VBAProjectPassword     scroll down to OK key     .SendKeys TAB     click OK key     .SendKeys ENTER     the project is now locked  this takes effect     the very next time the books opened...

But the user crazily click on button5 10 clicks per second  yeah some people click like that, it decreases the performance like the amount take delay to display because every click it points to focus on text field.p  pIm thinking of some work around like if the user clicks more than 3 times in 1 second we call the focus function only after the last click I dont know this is a right solution if you guys know anything better please suggest. Another problem is I cant use setInterval and clearInterval.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 59817 pI have a C Console Application that is bulk transforming around 100 XML files to a different markup using the XSLT document strongTransformer.xslstrong. Each of these XML files contains a hierarchy of topics that are assigned an ID based on the documents title and its hierarchal position, e.g. p  precodelttopic idBSAR1.5.2gt...some content...lttopicgt codepre  pTo do this I am using the strongGetFileNameWithoutExtensionstrong C method to get the file name and use it as the ID by passing it through an strongXSLCompliedTransformstrong as a argument.p  pI know that the argument works from inside the XSL document, as it has been tested using Oxygen, and I know that without the argument the XSL transformer runs as follows in C.p  precodecreate XSLT complied transformer             XslCompiledTransform xslTrans  new XslCompiledTransform  load in xslt             xslTrans.LoadxslPathstring fileExtension  Path.GetFileNamexmlPath              string output pathDITADITAfileExtension              Add arguments for TopicID             XsltArgumentList argXSLT  new XsltArgumentList             String fileID  Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtensionxmlPath             argXSLT.AddParamtopicID,,fileID  convert XML document             xslTrans.TransformxmlPath, output codepre  pwhere pathDITA is a variable within the application for where the files are output to, and the arguments section has been commented out. p  pMy issue stands at what Transformer to use when wanting to convert from an XML to an XML including arguments. Currently the transformer method used is strongXslCompiledTransform.Transformstring URI, string ResultsFilestrong.

Negative 59817 pFor a project, Ive given a sequence that the program searches for and tries to find a sequence of letters.

Negative 59817 pIm developing an app that involves the user having to select a song from their music library. When I was researching in the documentation I saw the media picker, but since it was not customisable in any way I decided it was best to implement my own music picker.p  pThe problem Im having is with the sorting done by iOS to the songs names, in alphabetical order. Let me elaborate.p  pWhen I get a list of songs via an MPMediaQuery, the list already comes ordered, but not in the conventional alphabetical order. The one it uses is the same as the one in the music app, which is a bit different. For instance, it ignores some words in the beginning of the title such as emTheem and emAem, so that strongThe A Teamstrong counts as starting with the letter strongastrong and strongA Thousand Yearsstrong with the letter strongtstrong. It also ignores parenthesis and such.p  pThe problem is that I dont know exactly how it decides what comes first. Also, without something automatic, this makes localisation impossible. I needed to know precisely how thats done so that I could separate the songs by sections, for example.p  pSo, the real question is is there a way to replicate this kind of sorting Maybe some method that sorts NSStrings hidden in a different class like NSArray or NSDictionary or maybe something in the localisation features, anything that could help me here.p  pThanks in advance Dp

Negative 59817 pI wm developing a WPF app which monitors some important data about a set of running processes and displays it. I have a few other tabs which has codeUserControlcodes that perform some other functions. The processes tabs uses a dispatcher timer to update the data every 1 second and the computation is relatively heavy. What I am trying to do here is to fire the timer only when the processes tabs is selected and stop it when some other tab is selected so that the data computation does not occur unnecessarily when the user is not viewing it. For my application the intermediate data values are irrelevant.p  pI was thinking of subscribing to the codeLoadedcode and codeUnloadedcode events of the codeUserControlcode that is used as the tab content to start and stop the timer respectively. Are there any better alternativesp  pWhat is the best method of achieving this functionalityp

Negative 59817 pI have one method to combine 3 greyscale images to one colour image which is done by using codegetRedcode, codegetGreencode and codegetBluecode in Java, for each individual input image and then applying the colour to the output image which works quite well. Im looking to find other methods for doing this however. It doesnt have to be accurate in terms of sea being blue, etc. but it needs to be coloured in a way that different areas of the map can be differentiated.

Negative 59817 pAs far as I can tell, hardware prefetchers will at the very least detect and fetch constant strides through memory. Additionally it can a hrefhttpsoftware.intel.comenusblogs20090824whatyouneedtoknowaboutprefetchingmonitor data access patternsa, whatever that really means. Which led me to wonder, strongdo hardware prefetchers ever base their decisions on actual data stored in memory, or purely based on the behaviour a program is exhibitingstrongp  pThe reason I ask is because I will occasionally use nonnative pointers as pointers. A simple example of this would be a preallocated array of stuff, and small integers indexing this array instead of pointers. If I need to store a whole lot of such pointers, the savings in memory can add up quickly and in turn indirectly improve cacheperformance by using less memory.p  pBut for all I know, this might interfere with how hardware prefetchers work. Or not p  pI can certainly imagine, realistic or not, a prefetching unit that examines cache lines that enters L1 cache for native pointer addresses and starts fetching them into L2 or some such thing. In that case, my clever trick of saving memory suddenly seems less decidedly clever.p  pstrongSo, what do modern hardware prefetchers do, really Can they be tripped up by nonnative pointersstrongp

Negative 59817 pFor every field parameter in my report, when using the PUC Report Viewer, the PUC refresh the screen. It take quite a time and most of the reports i made have about 36 fields.p  pSearching in Pentaho Docs, i found this link that tells something about the Prompting API a hrefhttpwiki.pentaho.comdisplayServ...PromptingAPI relnofollowhttpwiki.pentaho.comdisplayServ...PromptingAPIa.p  pBut I have read all related pages and didnt find how to disable this reloading. It says that this behavour is to enable custom loadings parameters like Country and State, but for me its not necessary to have this kind of fields.p  pHow could i disable this option Note that i am not talking about auto update REPORT on selection, but auto update PARAMETER FIELDS.p  pDo i need to change the source code of some project or i can do that just by xml setting I am not a developer so if there is a XML or related file it would be easyer to me.p  pSee that my problem is not the report reload when i change a field, but is that the PUC refresh the screen to reload filter configuration, as in its documentation. What i whant to do is to be able to type every parameter on the screen without having to wait for this loading, as you may know, you can not use TAB to fill this parameters, because of this reloads. p  pThanks. p

Negative 59817 pWe have an existing app in the Apple store. Im using PhoneGap Build to completely rebuild and replace it, rather than providing this PhoneGap Build app as a new app.p  pThe kicker is the certificate, provisioning profile, and private key that Apple requires. We have all of this for our current app, and Id like to use it in the new app. I made sure to make the new app bundle id the same as the current one.p  pI created a new development provisioning profile for myself, using the old certificate. If I upload all this to the new app with PhoneGap Build, it builds fine with no errors. But if I download it to the iPad or attempt to use it with the iPhone simulator on our Mac, it either wont install iPad or crashes when opening sim.p  pI expect its a signing problem, but all my attempts have failed and I feel in over my head. So heres the question how do I use our current certificates, etc., with the new app Is it possible Can I create new devdist certificates and still update the current app in the Apple storep
Negative 59817 pI have a .NET 4.0, SQL Server 2008 application built on VS 2010.p  pSince more than 10 months I have been working on a project and its completed now. I moved to the next task of creating an installation of the software. Its also done. But now I have a big issue.p  pMy clients already run software running SQL Server 2005 and its installed on their system. However when I was packaging my VS2010 C application, I deployed it with prerequisite of SQL Server 2008 but now the problem is, when I try to install my application, it asks to uninstall the code2005code and then to install code2008code. But my clients are very rigid to allow my program to uninstall any application on their system. I am stuck here.p  pI also tried to remove it from my prerequisites and the application was successful to install itself but after when I tried to run my application, its unable to access the database.p  pHow I can solve this issue Is there any way to make application and database both work with SQL Server 2005 or 2008. Or maybe any other expert advice.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI also have codeDatetimecode stuff which really annoyed with to accomplish, as my project is multilingual so I have separate functions to handle datetime to insert in SQL.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pIs it possible to upgrade SQL Server 2005 to 2008 using my own Visual Studio Deployment Projectp  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pThis is the error I am gettingp  blockquote   pPrerequisite check for system component SQL Server 2008 Express failed with the following error messagebr   SQL Server 2008 Express Service Pack 1 x64 cannot upgrade the existing instance of SQL Server 2005 Express x64 WoW named SQLEXPRESS.

Negative 59817 pI have a very simple terrain map, 256x256 tiles for example, its divided into tiles same squares.... every tile have height, slope... Something like figure below. My default look will be an iso view. Each tile can be divied into smaller tiles for smooth, i called tesselationp  precodeD3DXMatrixOrthoLHampmatProj, videoWidth , videoHeight , 100000, 100000 float xPitch0 float yPitchPI3.0 rotate yPitch 60 degree float zPitchPI4.0 rotate zPitch 45 degree codepre  pNow I need to select a unit tile onscreen with mouse where to move to or build something... I have mouse position Mx,My I need to know what tile it is If the map is flat, its very easy but with height, its difficult. Im planning to make the map quite static not rotate often... only translation. So I can store all the Vertex coordinate x,y on screen. By using D3DXVec3Project. And then search the triangles that contain the mouse position the tile we needed However with this approach we may need to search 510 or 20 triangles. Do you know any betterway, more optimized or elegant  Thanksp  pI read about something like RayCasting for detection, maybe it can be used in my case.

Negative 59817 pI am running a delete which removes all of the duplicates within a table. A duplicate is defined as a row where the tagid, userid, and isself are all the same. My technique here is pretty standard, to preform this delete, since the tagsusers table itself needs to be referenced to know if a duplicate exists a temp table is created so that a delete can be preformed from the same table that is being referenced. The problem is that this table is about a million rows so this query takes about an hour to run. I know this is related to the slow speed of defining this temp table and then referencing it as it is unindexed.p  precodeDELETE FROM tagsusers WHERE id IN       SELECT id FROM          SELECT A.id FROM tagsusers as A, tagsusers as B WHERE A.id gt B.id AND A.userid  B.userid AND A.tagid  B.tagid AND A.isself  B.isself GROUP BY A.id       tempdupdelete  codepre  pI have reviewed the explain from this query listed here Please note Im on mysql 5.5 so Im using EXPLAIN SELECT 1 to simulate EXPLAIN DELETE. I think the best possible solution to this is to define an index on the temp table, but I cannot figure out how to do this yet. The crux of my question here is is there a way to improve the speed of this query considering the way it defines a temp table.

Negative 59817 pI need to trim words from begining and end of string. Problem is, sometimes the words can be abbreviated ie. only first three letters followed by dot.p  pI tried hard to find suitable regular expression. Basicaly I need to chatch three or more initial characters up to length of replacement, but I cannot find regular expression, that will match variable length and will keep order of characters.p  pFor example, if I need to trim codeinsurancecode from sentence codeinsur. companies are richcode, then pattern code[insurance]3,9code comes to my mind, but this pattern will also catch words like codesensacecode, because order of characters and their occurance inside code[]code is not important for regexp.p  pAlso, at end of string, I need remove serialnumbers, that are abbreviated from beginig  say codeXK25F14code is sometimes presented as code25F14code. So I decided to go purely with character by character comparison.p  pTherefore I end with following php functionp  precodefunction trimWordss, dirt, caseinsensitive  false, reverse  true      pos  0     func  caseinsensitive  strncasecmp  strncmp       Get number of initial characters, that match in both strings      while funcs, dirt, pos  1  0         pos       If more than 2 initial characters match, then remove the match        if pos gt 2         s  substrs, pos       Reverse s and dirt so it will trim from the end of string     s  strrevs             if reverse         return trimWordss, strrevdirt, caseinsensitive, false       After second run return backreversed string      return trims,  .  codepre  pIm happy with this function, but it has one drawback. It trims only one occurence of word. How to make it trim more occurances, i.e. remove both codeinsurance code from codeInsurance insur. companiescode.p  pAnd Im also curious, it realy does not exists such regular expression, that will match variable length and will respect order of characters in patternp  h2Final solutionh2  pstrongThanks to mrhobostrong I have ended with function based on regular expression. This function can be easily improved and shall also be the most efficient for this task.p  pI have modified my previous function and it is two times quicker than regexp, but it can remove only one word per single run, so to be able to remove word from begin and end, it has to runs itself twice and performance is same as regexp and to remove more than one occurance of word, it has to runs itself multiple times, which will then be more and more slower.p  pThe final function goes like this.p  precodefunction trimWordsstring, word, caseinsensitive  false, minabbrv  3      exc  substrword, minabbrv     pat  null      i  strlenexc     while i         pat  gt.pregquoteexc[i], .pat.      pat  substrword, 0, minabbrv.pat     pat  ltbegingtWb.pat.bWbegin     if caseinsensitive         pat . i      return pregreplacepat, , string  codepre  pNOTE with this function, it does not matter, if abbreviation ends with dot or not, it wipes out any shorter form of word and also removes all nonword characters around the word.p  pEDIT I just tried create replace pattern like codeinsurraranrancrancecode and function with atomic groups is faster by 30 and with longer words it could be possibly even more efficient.p

Negative 59817 pI have been looking for a way to let PHP run some command line tasks including some sudo commands i.e reboot. I understand that giving sudo acccess to the wwwdata user is a security risk. Most people say to write to a file and let cron pick it up every minute and run the command.p  pBut when I press reboot I want it to reboot.p  pIts a Raspberry Pi with some recording software on, which will be controlled using the web interface like codewebmincode, all routers. The Raspberry Pi will obviously sit on a local network with access to downloadupload information on the internet, the Raspberry Pi will have a username and password to access the web interface. p  pIsnt this just how your router works The web interface of a router basically has root access and in most cases you can set a bash script to run, surely thats just as insecure as what Im trying to achieve with the Raspberry Pi.p  pAs long as the Raspberry Pis web interface is secure, ssh log in is disabled but only log in via keys enabled I can give codewwwdatacode access to sudo commandsp  pRight Or will there still be issuesp

Negative 59817 pIm really confused by Yiis bizrules and authitems in general. At the moment Im getting stuck in how to implement the following. Ive got multiple codeTeamcode model instances, these have multiple codeUsercode model instances assigned. Now I want to authorize multiple of those assigned users as codeteam admincode codeAuthItemcode. p  pStoring it in codeAuthAssignmentcode seems to be the most logical way to store it to me, since I simply want to assign a codeAuthItemcode to a user. I can also store data to the assignment, so Ill be able to store the teamid with the assignment as well. But this seems to be really inefficient in Yii, since as far as I can tell will have to store a bizrule to every single assignment like codereturn data[teamid]  params[teamid]code. p  pIs there something Im missing Or should I just go and store the assignments outside codeAuthAssignmentcode and store it in my custom tablep

Negative 59817 pI have a problem with the codeSystem.Net.WebClientcode codeDownloadStringcode method. I use this method to invoke an aspx page that perform some operations using a library. Now, this library is used trough a WebService too, that is sensible to Internet Explorer language setting. This mean that if I login via this WebService trough Internet Explorer the library stores in a way that I cant control the last used language.p  pThis is causing me troubles because when I use the DownloadString method to invoke my aspx page, even if I set the codeHeaders[AcceptLanguage]  enUScode to the WebClient object, the DLL uses the last Internet Explorer language.p  pThe question is is there any parameter that is sent with Internet Explorer with its language setting If yes, how can I set this in the WebClient powershell instancep  hr  h2Solutionh2  pAs suggested by Raf the answer is in the combination of headersession, I just had to log out the Web service to allow a redefinition of the language via PowerShell using AcceptLanguage header parameter.p

Negative 59817 pI was building a resumeable file uploader in Nodejs. First I implemented it in raw Node.js using codesocket.emitcode then I ported it to Sails.js and made calls to sails controllers using codesocket.postcode from the client.

Negative 59817 pThanks to help by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers505088davidheffernanDavid Heffernana I have a program written in Freepascal but a Delphi solution to my question would suffice that reads a physical disk sector by sector. It does so using the Windows API CreateFileW function for the disk handle, then a hrefhttpwww.freepascal.orgdocshtmlrtlsysutilsfileread.html relnofollowFileFilea, a hrefhttpwww.freepascal.orgdocshtmlrtlsysutilsfileseek.html relnofollowFileSeeka etc to navigate and read. If all the sectors are OK, it works fine. However, if the disk had bad sectors, I need to treat them differently.  p  pMy question is, is there and procedures or libraries that can be used, while reading these sectors, to determine if they are bad sectors If not, how might I go about it I gather it is the disk controller that knows what sectors are bad and which are not, so I dont think my program can actually access a bad sector, so how can I detect which are the bad ones and act accordingly Does one need to query SMART and if so, how p  pI have searched this site only found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15678703checkforbadsectorsonharddiskthis C posta, which relates to a program, not code and Googled it and no obvious solutions came to my attention. p

Negative 59817 pIm writing validations for a model in my Rails 4 app and for some reason the changes arent taking effect when I access the page at localhost3000. p  pFor example, I wrote several codepresence truecode validations for the Product models price, description, and imageurl attributes as well as a numericality validation for its price. When I make a new invalid object in the rails console it is correctly flagged as invalid. However, when I go to the page at localhost3000products and refresh Im able to create a new object even with invalid attributes.p  pI did some searching on StackOverflow and found a few things about adding something to my config but I was under the impression that changes to models should take effect immediately in development and though Im a beginner I dont remember ever having to change any configuration to make sure that was the case.

Negative 59817 pI have an existing application that doesnt use emberjs, and am looking at doing a rewrite of the front end. I would like to incorporate emberjs into the project using embercli. While not a single page app the application only has 4 pages, each have allot going on, very heavy JS, so I thought it would make sense to make an emberjs app for each of the four pages, that way I could migrate pagebypage.p  pSo the first page I was looking at migrating is the simplest of the four, a account page where account detailssettings etc can be modified. This is what Ive donep  pWent into my js directory of my app which has all the legacy code I intend to migrate ran codeember new accountcode to create an embercli app in the account directory. After that I ran codeember buildcode to build my project, the compiled files were added to accountdist . I then linked to the two JS files created in accountdistassets like sop      pNow I see that embercli does create its own index.html inside dist, but I will not be using that. Im thinking I can just remove some of the stuff that I dont need before deployment.p  pMy question is, does it seem like I am on the right path here Is there any reason I shouldnt be trying to do what I am doing now Are there more things I need to consider than just linking to the account.js and vendor.js scripts Ive done a fair bit of Googling but since these tools are still pretty new I didnt find much that was relevant to what I am trying to do.Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks muchp

Negative 59817 pHello fellow StackOverFlowers,p  pI am currently working on a bigger project in the area of imageprocessing. I am developing using Visual Studio 2013 not negotiable.

Using all remaining threadspli ol  pIn order to know which images need to be registered, an approximate solution of the system of linear equations is required. Therefore they need to run simultaniously. Thanks to  Z boson for pointing out the absence of this information. The iterative Solution runs constantly and gets informed after every successful image registartion.p  pThe code is going to run on a 24cored system.p  pAt the moment the imageregistration is implemented using openMP and a pragma omp parallel for. The iterative solution is being started using an stdthread and also uses an openMP pragma omp parallel for internally.p  pNow I know, that according to a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE1905901stud.1081905012nested.html relnofollowthe omp documentationa an ompthread that finds a nested parallelism will use its threadteam to execute the code.

Negative 59817 pI am having some difficulty to understand the whole js and assets aggregation process in MEAN.io mostly because I dont know JS and Node well enough. I really like the way things are organized in MEAN.io but all the abstractions are very hard to grasp for a newcomer. I started with simpler MEAN stack generators and kept with them so far, but know I would really like to understand what happens behind the curtains.p  pI will try to separate my doubts in clear questions. If there is a way to answer everything linearly with a walkthrough style explanation of a concept that I am missing here plase do so.p  p1 The documentation says that any file put inside the assets folder of a package will not be aggregated unless explicitly by the codeaggregateAssetcode function. Why would someone add a css, media or js file to a packages clientside code and not want it aggregated Some example would be greatly appreciated.p  p2 Is there any easy way to not aggregate all the js files It would be great to leave them separated for debugging during development.p  p3 Are the js files of the contrib mean packages inside nodemodules also aggregated automatically the ones outside the assets folder If they are not, then the contrib packages call codeaggregateAssetcode for all their js filesp  p4 How does my app know to include the installed contrib mean packages I have not seen anywhere they being included but they seem to work anyway.p  pThanks a lot p

Negative 59817 pI recently created some partitioned queues from where I send and receive all the time. Theyve run as nonpartitioned in the past without any of my current issues.p  pThe problem is, I have a constant number of messages in the queue that I can not receive. I always get nothing back when not sending any other messages to the queues but when I send messages to the queues I receive the new messages without a problem. The messages that are stuck in the queue are active messages, not dead lettered.p  pIm suspecting theyre stuck in a specific partitions but I dont know how to receive them.p  pSince I cannot receive these messages is there way to reset the ServiceBus Queuep  pAny ideasp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe number is not constant but very slowly increasing. On our testing environment we receive little more than 2000 messages per hour and the queues, after being reset to 0 zero has received around 20 messages each in the last 12 hours. Those messages are just there but not receivable. At least not in the usual way.p  pThe issue is only in two namespaces after they have been partitioned. The issue is not in our live environment where we dont use partitioned queues.p

Negative 59817 pI have a SQLite database populated by a C application. I am also working on a web interface to allow different diplays using Javascript and PHP. There will only be one instance of the interface open at any given time but it will be on another machine in the network from the SQLite file and C application.p  pThere are a couple fields I would like to be able to update from the interface. I can create a trigger to let the C application know when data is changed, but if PHP makes the change, the trigger targets that connection and throws an error since the callback function is defined in the C code. I tried enabling shared cache connections for everything involved but the SQLite trigger still cant cross the applications.p  pIs there a way to automatically notify the C application of changes or will I have to regularly poll the database if we continue using SQLitep  pThe documentation Ive been able to find all suggest the latter, but most of it is either vague or older so Im hoping theres a workaround I havent been able to find.p

Negative 59817 pWe are using SQL Server 2012 EE but currently do not have the option to run queries on a RO mirror though that is my long term goal, though am concerned I may run into the below issue in that scenario as well since the mirror would also be updating data I am querying.p  pI have a view that joins across several tables from two databases and is used for invoicing from existing data. Three of these tables are also actively updated by ongoing transactions. Running a report that used this view did not used to be a problem but now our database is getting much larger and I have run into some timeout problems. First the query was timing out so I set command timeout to 0 and reran the query which pegged all 4 CPUs 100 for 90 minutes and then I killed it. There were no problems with active transactions during that time. I reviewed the query and found a field I was joining on that was not indexed so created an index on that field, reran the report, which then finished in three minutes and all the CPUs were busy but not at all pegged out. Same data amount queried both times. I figured problem solved. Of course later, my boss ran a similar query, perhaps with some more data but probably not a lot more, and our live transactions started timing out 100 while his query was running. I did not get a chance to see the CPU usage during that time.p  pSo my questions are twop  ol lipGiven I have to use the live and active database, what is the proper way to run a long RO query so that active transactions can still continue I am considering NO LOCK but am hoping there is a better standard practice.pli lipAnd what might cause sqlserver to peg out 4 CPUs with 100 busy and not cause live transaction timeouts, yet when my boss ran his query, after I added the index and my query ran much better, the live update transactions start timing out 100pli ol  pI know this is not a lot of info to go on. Im not very familiar with sql profiling and performance monitoring yet this behavior seems rather odd and am hoping a best practice would be the correct workaround. Thanks, Davep

Negative 59817 pI have a textbox where a user writes basically anything. This text needs to be searched and replaced inside a txt file.

Opening the file, making a search and replace etc. is not a problem. Problem is to check if the next char is a number.

Negative 59817 pI have a question about storing a UUID. I would like to use Java to generate a UUID and save it so that I can retrieve it the next time the application runs.p  pIn a .NET application I built, Im doing something similar to this. Im using the Windows Registry to store the UUID and all other settings. However, this Java application is supposed to be crossplatform compatible. This presents the problem. Obviously on other operating systems I wont have the Windows Registry for such a task, so how would I go about thisp  pI have one solution for this problem, but Id like something slightly more sophisticated. My current solution is storing a text file named something like codeunique.txtcode in the applications directory and then reading it at runtime.p  pHere are my grievances about that solutionp  ul liIf the user moves the application to a new directory, the program has to generate a new UUID and settings file.li liI dont like the fact that the user can see the settings file sitting in their directory.li ul  pHere are the conditions Id like a solution to satisfyp  ul liThe solution should be able to store a UUID value and possibly other variables in such a way that they can be retrieved and modified at runtime.li liIf the application is deleted and then redownloaded, the values of the previous installation should still be retrievable.li liThe file used to store the values should not appear in the directory of the application no sense cluttering up the users directory with a settings file.li liIf the user moves the application to a different directory, the application should still be able to retrieve the previous settings file. The settings should not be dependent on the directory.li ul  pI have thought about storing the settings file in the root directory codecode on unix and codeCcode on Windows however, in my experience, writing to the root directory typically requires elevated permissions. I also feel like the root directory is not the most appropriate location for this.p  pIf Java has a built in method for doing something like this, I would greatly appreciate someone pointing me in the direction of it. Otherwise, if someone could provide some guidance, that would also be great.p  pI apologize if this question is a duplicate. Ive searched for something like this, but I havent found an answer. If anything about the question is unclear, please add a comment and Ill try to revise the question to clarify.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 59817 pI managed to implement the Google Play Services API in my Cordova app game. The game now sends the Google Play Services Player ID to my server when a person connects.p  pI am making a system that validates a users permissions and sends them some data an image from my server if the permissions check out. So, I have the Player ID, but that isnt enough to validate that they are who they say they are.p  pI dont understand how to use Oauth2 to validate a user is who they say they are.p  pStop me when I go off trackp  pPresumably, I would need a onetime token from them that I could then validate with, eh, something, and then run a PHP validation function with that token and the something to validate that they are who they say they are.p  pIm not sure how to request the token without having Google Play Services create an authorization window within my app, or what the code for any of it is. I saw some Oauth 2 things in PHP but they are positively gigantic things. Im looking for something that can clearly explain how I can validate the user and a couple of lines of code for implementing it.p

Negative 59817 pI am a programmer and I have been working for quite some time on a website that highly depends on paypal working properly on it. Without it , it is really useless. So please take this matter really serious and as a really really urgent issuep  pAround 1 in the morning my time  I am at CET timezone  everything working perfectly, I polished up the code, functions and it was working as it should. I made triple checks before I went to sleep that everything works as it should.p  pI wake up in the morning and nothing that has to do with paypal actually works. A little bit of an explanation of what I am using before I show you the actual code and error. I am using express checkout and paypal adaptive payments sdk  link for adaptive payments sdk a hrefhttpsgithub.compaypaladaptivepaymentssdkphphttpsgithub.compaypaladaptivepaymentssdkphpa .p  pI have a few virtual accounts that I made on developer.paypal.com in order to simulate facilitator  owner  and buyer interaction since I have scenario when owner gives money to ther user and visa versa. Anyhow they both worked perfectly and now they both throw this error  in adaptive payments sdk, it tells me in which line of code is a mistake and in express checkout since that is code that is done via documentation it does not show in which file the error is but it is the same error p  blockquote   perror14077410SSL routinesSSL23GETSERVERHELLOsslv3 alert   handshake failurep blockquote  pNow after  I saw this post a hrefhttpsdevblog.paypal.compoodlessl30vulnerabilityhttpsdevblog.paypal.compoodlessl30vulnerabilitya that you just disabled ssl totally, I realized that the problem is in that actually. You want your users to use TLS now which is totally fine. I triple checked that my server has tls enabled and it does and I changed  for over a million times already  my config settings to use that tsl in curl  since I am using php  by doing something like p  pcodecurlsetoptch, CURLOPTSSLVERSION, 1code  this is how it looks like in express checkout and  in adaptive payments it is just an associtiave array , but it is really the same thing in both  p  pI also found somewhere and in your advices to actually update my api credindentials. I did that. I went to paypal.com  api and then clicked update which worked, but then I noticed that on my developer.paypal.com account where I have a few of virtual accounts nothing has changed. Should I update those manually or what  p  pIf anyone is willing to help out , I am ready to get on Skype and do a screenshare or something p  pstrongEDITstrong p  pThis was sent to paypal support and I was really in a hurry and could not write the entire thing again, so sorry about that  Issue is strongfixedstrong thanks to anyone who actually took time to read it. p  pThe issue was fixed with the adding CURLOPTSSLCIPHERLIST  TLSv1 to your PPHttpConfig.php file  Thanks Fang Cao  p

So the data is such that we have 9 data points of stimulation, and then 15 of rest and it keeps going on like that for around 300 data points 4 mins in realtime. p  pI am able to plot the data easily but I am trying to overlay a square wave which represents the time in which there is stimuluation so that just by looking at the graph it is easy to see which is the rest period and which stimulation. p  pVery simply I have created a vector X and made it so that the first 3 points are meant to be 0p  precode  X  [0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0 0]  codepre  pAnd plotted it on the same graph as the data. It works fine but the problem is that I need X to be created automatically according to my time scale. p  precodeTotaltime  [31.5302] codepre  pThis is my total time scale, from 3 to 302 seconds with the sampling rate as 1.5s. the first 3 points  3, 1.5, 0 are period of rest. Then from 0 seconds the stimulus starts for about 9 seconds that will make 6 data points in that 9 second period. p  pSo my question is  is it possible to use some sort of for loop to create this vector X to say that for 6 data points from 0 X  1 and for the next 10 X  0 I was thinking of the followingp  precodeX  zeros1,304 to create a 1x304 vector of zeros  X030 X391 X9190 codepre  pBut then again.. this is writing it by hand. p  pCan anyone helpp  pThanksp

Negative 59817 pGive the following scenario. I have a mobile App on iOSAndroid which is connected to a server backend via REST. Within the app you can display news items. These items can be created, edited and deleted of you are the creator of the item. On one page in the app there is a news feed where you can see an overview of news items created by other app users. The iOSAndroid app stores the data of these news items in a local sqlite database. When the user scrolls down the list of items further items should be loaded if there are any.p  pThe task I want to solve is how the items will be cached in the SQLite database to work with pagination.

Negative 59817 pI just caught myself writing the most horrible piece of code I have seen, while attempting to solve a graphtopography problem I encountered. Before I go into the details, let me just make the question very clear strongI have an unholy number of nestled loopsconditionalsstrong, and I am wondering if theres a way I can avoid it. p  pI have the following objects at my disposalp  ol lipA codeDatasetcode which is a collection of data points from a specific experiment.

Also this object has methods for data retrieval.. approx. 30K elements, 10K setspli lipA collection of codeSetcodes that are evaluated based on the dataset 1. pli ol  pWhat I want to do is to build a graph that has codeElementcodes as nodes, and codeSetcode membership relations as edges.p  pstrongExamplestrong Take two elements, eme1em and eme2em. Assume that eme1em is a member of sets emS1em, emS2em and emS4em while eme2em is a member of emS1em, emS3em and emS4em. In this case, there should be two edges between eme1em and eme2em, that represent sets emS1em and emS4em. p  pNote that codeDatasetcode object will typically contain a small portion of codeElementcodes that exist in the codeDatabasecode, so in the example above there a large number of other elements that should not be in the graph because they are not featured in the codeDatasetcode even though they have membership to the sets in question. p  pGiven the problem, my simple read emnaiveem solution in pseudocode was to loop overp  ol lithe dataset  codefor data d  datasetcodeli lithe sets codedcode is a member of  codeforset s  database.getSetsWithdcodeli lithe elements of codescode  codefor elem e  s.getElementscodeli lithe remaining elements in dataset  codefordata dx  dataset  dcodeli ol  pAND create coded, dxcode pair if the two elements are a part of the set codescode together. p  pThis solution is composed of 4 nested codeforcode loops and a conditional check deep down to eventual pairing.

Negative 59817 pMy app has a set of horizonal bars obstacles that move up from the bottom of the screen. When they hit an invisible horizontal bar at the bottom 13rd of the screen, I want to spawn another set of obstacles.p  pI have set the spawning bar to be a gray rectangular sprite for now, just for debugging. When the obstacles move upwards, they simply pass under the spawning bar and no contact is detected. However, when I set the physicsBody.dynamic property of the spawning bar to YES the contact is detected. I cant use this, though, because it would push the bar offscreen.p  pIs there a problem with detecting contact between 2 nondynamic bodies How can I fix thisp

Negative 59817 pIs there anything in the symfony annotations modules that allow me to use them for other uses  Like i know for Route and Method you need to extend existing libraries, so its just not that easy im guessing. p  pCurrently, im working with the history API, and would LOVE to put the popState data for my javascript files in the annotations, so they are already available when the routing generates the url, makes sense to have a HTML5 annotated title here now doesnt it  p  pIt would be great to put this next to the already existing route name and stuff.  Is there anybody that has tweaked wtih the annotations before  p  pstrongEDITstrong im going to clarify my intentions here as i probably left out some crucial details for understanding my motive, but i thought it was more clear.p  pOk, so i use alot of ajax on my symfony2 app. i use fosjsrouter to handle routing.  Instead of urls triggering the routes and actions, its a SPA so i have click events triggering run the route using ajax, passing the param data to the php methods directly this way.  p  pSo given this, i have a nice JS object method that runs this ajax call, and it  passes json around to and from the backend. It is inside this method that im focusing on being the best place to add some historyAPI functionality to it, for the back button.  p  pIm thinking this ajax method would be the perfect place to look if a history flag was called, and populate the historys state data right here and now inside this method.  Its a good place because the json data object im passing around in the JS method contains already alot of the crucial route data, and param information for that route needed in the backend php, which comes from the annotations.   so if i add a history state title, and url to the annotation, then i will have access to that information right there available to create a nice history state, if flagged, right inside the an ajax.done  inside this main JS routing method.p  pstrongEDITstrong can somebody with 1000 rep plesae add the historyAPI tag to this.p  pstrongEDITstrong im not so sure thats what i was thinking, it looks like its making me set the values of teh title and url for this inside the return statement of the php function, where i want it set in the annotation see return codeMatthias Nobackcodep  pso im trying this, but where to i set these titles atp  precode    ltphp  namespace BlahCoreBundleController  use SymfonyBundleFrameworkBundleControllerController     Annotation   class HistoryAnnotationController       history state params are out properties here..            var           private url             var           private title                        public function construct                        return mixed           public function getTitle              return thisgttitle                  return mixed           public function getUrl              return thisgturl       codepre  pI want to set it WAY back here, so the ajax that calls this route has access to it.. look for historyApiTitle in this code, etc..p  precodeltphp  namespace BlahBundleController use SymfonyBundleFrameworkBundleControllerController,     SymfonyComponentHttpFoundationJsonResponse,     SensioBundleFrameworkExtraBundleConfigurationMethod,     SensioBundleFrameworkExtraBundleConfigurationRoute,     SensioBundleFrameworkExtraBundleConfigurationTemplate,     BlahBundleEntityTest,     DoctrineORMQuery for hydration  class StuffController             Routesomeroutenametest, namesomeroutename, optionsexposetrue       param test       return mixed       historyApiTitleThis is the get something page       historyApiUrlgetsomething           public function getSomethingActiontest               em  thisgtgetDoctrinegtgetManager          dql               SELECT s             FROM BlahBundleStuff s             WHERE s.test  test          query  emgtcreateQuerydql         querygtsetParametertest, test         paginator  thisgtgetknppaginator          pagination  paginatorgtpaginatequery,             thisgtgetrequestgtquerygtgetpage, 1, 1000          return thisgtrenderBlahBundleStuffgetsomething.html.twig, arraypagination gt pagination       codepre  pSo looking at these TWO code examples, how to i connect the dots between the two to get this to workp

Im using Bootstrap 3 framework and have a form in a modal that processes correctly i.e. a user clicks the submit button and the form is processed correctly. p  pThere is another form on the page which does not process correctly. When a user clicks the submit button, the form is supposed to be processed and bring the user to a new page goodsub.html but when the submit button is clicked, nothing happens. Is there something wrong with my HTML p  pI am very new to PHP so I used some premade PHP documents that seem to work fine for the first form on the page. Note that when I comment out the form within the modal, my second form processes correctly and sends the user to goodsub.html.p  pPage in question can be viewed at a

Negative 59817 pI was wondering how I could map RGB values to xycoordinates. For example, in some applications, I have seen circles where moving the cursor within that circle would change rgb values evenly. p  pIn my case, I have a square area and I would like to map an xy coordinate within that area to rgb value. I would only expect that RGB values would ne in the range [0, 255] given the xy area which lets say the values for x and y would be in the range [0, 100]. Also expect a gradual change in color so for example 1,1 could be 255, 0, 0 and a change in xy to 1,2 would result in a similar rgb 254, 1, 0 rather than a completely different color 129, 244, 65p  pCan someone show me the math behind this Better yet, some c code p

Negative 59817 pI have an application which uses ADO.NET datasets and data adapters in combination with remoting clientserver architecture, transmitting datasets via remoting.p  pI now face the following issuep  pTLDR double value code44.850000925362000code turns into code44.850000925362004code after sending a dataset via remoting to the server.p  pI create a new row in the database by saving the dataset, which contains a float column mapped to double in the dataset. The double value saved is code44.850000925362codep  pI then read this row from the database codeDataAdapter.Fillcode and get the same value checked with codeBitConverter.DoubleToInt64code. This dataset passes via remoting to the client and is then merged into a usecase dataset on the client. Still retaining the same value.p  pThis dataset is then merged into a usecasedataset, the row from that is imported into a different table because read from a view, saved to table and a value is changed before transmitting the usecasedataset now containing a row in the other table. p  pOn the clientside the value is still the same  but as soon as the dataset reaches the server, the value in question is different although no changes were made to that specific column  it is still codeUnchangedcode and even the original value is different.p  pExample Save code44.850000925362000code Read code44.850000925362000code Merge, Import, modify row  still code44.850000925362000code Send to server for saving, is code44.850000925362004code on serverp  p...which then causes a codeConcurrencyExceptioncode because the record is saved with code44.850000925362000code  but the data adapter update uses code44.850000925362004code in the codeWHEREcode condition optimistic concurrency.p  pNobody else touched that row in between.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI tried setting up a test server and everything works fine there. Funny thing is the same assembly works fine if I use it in a different service. I cant find anything in the config or startup which would explain this.  Im using a binary formatter on both, both are .NET 4.0, both use the same sourcecode... but one behaves different than the other.p  pstrongFurther updatestrongp  pI even captured the SQL statement that was being executed for the update. If I run the parameters as a codeWHEREcode clause in a codeSELECTcode statement, it fetches the correct record. So when I do this manually via SQL Management Studio, it accepts a small delta between the value in the row and the value I give it for a condition. Still, it doesnt work at all when running the update via the adapter.p  pAnyway, Ive given up. Ive resorted to rounding it to 5 digits  way more precision than what I need in that usecase anyway. Might yield weird results if the number gets large but I dont expect that in that use case were talking about weight in kilograms.p

Negative 59817 pI am currently working on moving my environment off Heroku and part of my application is runs a clock process that sets off a Sidekiq background job.p  pAs I understand it, Sidekiq is composed of a client, which sends jobs off to be queued into Redis and a server which pulls off requests of the queue and processes them. I am now trying to split out my application into the following containers on Docker  Redis container  Clock container Using Clockwork gem  Worker container  Web application container Railsp  pHowever, I am not sure how one is supposed to split up this Sidekiq server and client. Essentially, the clock container needs to be running Sidekiq on it so that the client can send off jobs to the Redis queue every so often. However, the worker containers should also run Sidekiq the server though on them so that they can process the jobs. I assume that splitting up the responsibilities between different containers should be quite possible to do since Heroku allows you to split this across various dynos.p  pI can imagine one way to do this would be to assign the clock container to pull off a nonexistent queue so that it just never pulls any jobs off the queue and then set the worker to be pulling off a queue that exists. However, this just doesnt seem like the most optimal approach to me since it will still be checking for new jobs in this nonexisting queue.p  pAny tips or guides on how I can start going about thisp

Now, I still havent coded the part where images slide or fade inout cause theres one issues Id like to get out of the way first I want to assign the carousel and all the images therein the same height computed as the height of the shortest image so as to avoid the carousel from changing height when a taller image gets displayed, or avoid cropping the image in case the carousel had a fixed height.p  pSo I jotted down a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netaxedrer2Ld272f relnofollowthis JSFiddlea to demonstrate, but so far the best solution I found to compute the heights of the transcluded images relies on two nested codetimeoutcodes with a 100ms delay. It looks to me more like a hack than anything.br So I was wondering if theres a proper way to accomplish it in angularjs. Cheers.p  pP.S. On a side note, I also dislike fetching the root element of the directives template, the codeltdiv classcarouselgtcode in my case, using codeelement.childrencode... is there no easy way to reference it in angularjs Looked around but no dice.p

Negative 59817 pI am adjusting a monitoring system which checks if a service is running or not. It does that by checking the process name and its memory consumption. Once it drops below 1 MB an alert is triggered. Also I use the memory usage value to display it in a graph. So checking and notifying is not the only purpose.p  pCurrently I have 5 Windows services using the same codeProcessNamecode and I dont know how to make my script distinguish them. The codeServiceNamecode for each service is of course different and the path to the executable as well.  When I run codegetprocesscode I see them all, but I dont see an option here distinguish them. Using codegetservicecode doesnt help much either, because it returns name, displayed name and status. Somehow I would love to combine the entries to see the memory usage by service name, not by process name.p
Negative 59817 pstrongSituationstrongp  pIm developing a winforms application with C in VS2013.p  pI have a datagridview bound to a MySQL table through a DataAdapter.

Negative 59817 p[EDIT] Before reading, I have managed to solve this by simply casting the different data classes. I have updated the code with what works but you are all welcome with tipsp  pDear stackoverflow users,p  pId like to start off by saying that I understand that the question is most likely going to be relatable to Automapper. Unfortunately... NuGet is, for some reason, not willing to install Automapper. So instead I decided to try my shot at writing a manual mapper between DTOs and entities. I am kinda new to IoC and DI which I am guessing is the main reason to why my implementation is incorrect.p  pBasically I have 5 different datagrids, where all of them are linked to different tables and therefor have different structures. However, they all have the exact same message handlers that points to the same methods in the viewmodel that will take care of adding, deleting and modifying.p  pThe code that handles deleting looks like this.p  pIn the viewmodelp  precode public void KeyDownEventArgs eventArgs, object sourceSender              var dataGridContext  sourceSender as DataGrid         var keyEventArgs  eventArgs as KeyEventArgs         if keyEventArgs  null return         switch keyEventArgs.Key                      case Key.Delete                 if dataGridContext  null                         foreach var selectedEntity in dataGridContext.SelectedItems.OfTypeltIEntityObjectgt                                                      mainModel.DeletePendingEntityObjectselectedEntity                                          break               codepre  pIn the modelp  precode    public void DeletePendingEntityObjectltTEntitygtTEntity sender where TEntity  IEntityObject               if sender.State  EntityState.Added                        pendingEntityObjects.Removesender              return                    AddPendingEntityObjectsender, EntityState.Deleted      codepre  pAnd the code that handles adding and modifying looks like thisp  pIn the viewmodelp  precode public void RowEditEndingobject sender              var dataGridContext  sender as DataGrid         if isNewItem ampamp dataGridContext  null                      var item  dataGridContext.CurrentItem as IEntityObject             mainModel.AddPendingEntityObjectitem, EntityState.Added             isNewItem  false                   else if dataGridContext  null                      var item  dataGridContext.CurrentItem as IEntityObject             if item  null return             mainModel.AddPendingEntityObjectitem, EntityState.Modified               codepre  pIn the modelp  precode    public void AddPendingEntityObjectltTEntitygtTEntity sender,  EntityState entityState where TEntity  IEntityObject              sender.State  entityState         pendingEntityObjects.Addsender      codepre  pNow, all of this works perfectly until I wanted to create a mapper that would map the DTO objects to their entities to save it to the database. I believe the implementation is incorrect because I will have to add every property in the interface that Id like to be mappable in the DtoMapper.cs shown below. Which ends up in all of DTOs having variables that are not related to them whatsoever.p  pThis is my try at itp  precode foreach var item in pendingEntityObjects                              using var context  new CentralEntities                                      var entityObj  new DtoMapperltIEntityObjectgtitem                     context.EntryentityObj.TranslatedObj.State  item.State                     context.SaveChanges                               codepre  pThis is what the DtoMapper.cs looks likep  precode    public DtoMapperT t              if t.GetType  typeofTable1Dto                      var table1Obj  t as Table1Dto             iftable1Obj  null             TranslatedObj  new table1                              id  table2Obj.Id,                 table1Code  table1Obj.Table1Code,                 reference  table1Obj.Reference                               else if t.GetType  typeof Table2Dto                      var table2Obj  t as Table2Dto             iftable2Obj  null             TranslatedObj  new table2                              id  table2Obj.Id,                 table2Code  table2Obj.Table2Code,                 reference  table2Obj.Reference                                 public object TranslatedObj  get set  codepre  pHow would I solve this to keep code clean and generic methodsmapper that would work with any datagrid Thanks in advancep

Negative 59817 pI am getting the dreadded runtime error cited in the title when I try to trigger a storyboard segue programmatically.p  pThe segue is set in the storyboard and is given the right identifier I have double checked this.p  pI suspect that the reason is that I am mixing storyboards and xibs To keep each screens layout in a separate file and ease collaboration, all my view controllers have their layout defined in a dedicated xib, not within their occurrencies within the main storyboard.  That is, all the view controller placeholders within the storyboard have the codeCustom Classcode field set to the appropriate class e.g., codeMyViewControllercode and thats it. The actual view layout is specified in each view controllers xib.p  pThat setup alone does not work the actual view described in the xib is not loaded when the view controller is instantiated from the storyboard, so I worked around it like thisp  pstrongMyViewController.swiftstrongp  precoderequired initcoder aDecoder NSCoder       Hack so that we can load the layout defined in the xib into a      storyboard that references this view controller.      super.initnibName MyViewController, bundle NSBundle.mainBundle   codepre  pNow, from within one of my view controllers methods, I am trying to programmatically trigger a segue like thisp  precodeperformSegueWithIdentifierProceedToNextScreen, sender self codepre  p...but that generates a runtime exception. p  pI emassumeem it is because of my mixing of storyboards and xibs. However, the storyboard entry point does work. But does it count as a seguep  pI was expecting that, eventhough my view controllers view is being instantiated from the dedicated xib not the one in the storyboard  that view is empty, since the instancing itself is caused by the view controllers presence inside the storyboard, the storyboard loading process would setup all the segues between view controllers as specified in Interface Builder. I was wrong, it seems.p  pIs there a way to ix this restore the segue at runtime somehowp  pI would rather use segues, to keep the flow specified in the storyboard, and not fallback to other transition methods like presenting modal view controllers etc. p

The report should show the top level, with the ability to drill down to the lowest level as defined by the report parameter.p  pThe hierarchy is ragged, but the criteria for determining the level of reporting requires a balanced hierarchy.p  pThe following example is givenp  precodeLevel 1                            A                                                                                                               Level 2         B          C              D               E                                                                                                                                           Level 3         F          G         H         I                                                                                                                                                     Level 4         J          K                  L                                                                                                        Level 5         M                                       codepre  pIn order to achieve what the client wants, each level below the top level needs to be pushed down as far as it will go to create a balanced hierarchyp  precodeLevel 1                            A                                                                                                               Level 2         B          X               X              X                                                                                                                                                                         Level 3         F          C               D              X                                                                                                                                                                Level 4         J          G          X         I         X                                                                                                                                                                      Level 5         M          K          H         L         E codepre  pThe Xs denote imaginary inserted nodes.p  pMy report needs to display nodes in the structure of the original hierarchy, but to use the levels on the second diagram above to determine the maximum depth shown.

Negative 59817 pSay I have a model Post and a model Author, and an author hasmany posts. Post also has a state attribute and a scope, where I can filter by Post.wherestate active. In RailsAdmin, Id like to have two fields in the Author page posts and activeposts, where activeposts are scoped to only associated posts with an active state. Ive tried the followingp  precodeconfig.model Author do   field posts   field activeposts do     formattedvalue do       bindings[object].posts.active     end   end end codepre  pObviously, this wont work because this just shows an ActiveRecord Association as the formatted value.p  pIve also tried defining an activeposts method on the Author model, and just calling field activeposts for config.model Author, but that just returns an association as well.p  pOn the other hand, something like on the wiki a hrefhttpsgithub.comsferikrailsadminwikiAssociationsscoping relnofollowhttpsgithub.comsferikrailsadminwikiAssociationsscopinga for association scoping isnt working at all the posts field is showing all associated posts, not posts within the scope.

Negative 59817 pI have a newly built MVC 5 app, using the default template, codePayCaddy.Clientcode. As built, without any mods, the project creates its own data model, covering entities like codeApplicationUsercode for authentication. I like this, just create the project, and its ready for me to do my own stuff and not worry too much about authentication.p  pYet now, my own stuff includes a separate business data model, in a separate project, codePayCaddy.Datacode, that includes entities like a bet in a golf gamep  precodepublic class Bet PayCaddyEntity      public virtual string BetName  get set      public virtual int Amount  get set      public virtual ApplicationUser Owner  get set      public virtual DateTime OpenedOn  get set      public virtual DateTime ClosedOn  get set      public ICollectionltBetUsergt Punters  get set   codepre  pNow codeApplicationUsercode is used here to indicate the user that initiated the bet, which will be between them and the codePunterscode. This leaves me stuck with a circular reference problem, where I need a reference to codePayCaddy.Clientcode for the codeApplicationUsercode entity, and that project needs a reference back for the codeBetcode entity.p  pThe Identity framework is highly complex, and simply moving its entities into my data model is out of the question. For now, I have moved my data model into the client project, the same prokect as the Identity code, but I dont want to continue like that if there is a relatively simple way of overcoming this problem. If solutions without days of effort exist, what are theyp

Negative 59817 pI am fairly new to Qt  QtQuick and I have to develop an application, which uses some sensor data that is received in a different thread over network periodically. This data should be used inside c for calculations and the latest data should also be displayed in QML. Everything is setup to be threadsafe inside c by using a mutex for protection and the data is visibly updated inside QML.  However, I have some concerns about threadsafety on the QML side and I cannot find information or an example on the web about this topic. Specifically I am concerned about returning a pointer which was the only way to return a C object to QML I guess instead of a value and therefore a copy of the object. Here is a minimal example demonstrating the concernp  precode File data.h include ltQObjectgt  class Data  public QObject      QOBJECT     QPROPERTYQString someData READ someData WRITE setSomeData NOTIFY someDataChanged  public     explicit DataQObject parent  nullptr          QObjectparent                QString someData const           return someData           void setSomeDataconst QStringamp value           if someData  value               someData  value              emit someDataChanged                 signals     void someDataChanged  private     QString someData    Data    File controller.h include ltQObjectgt  include ltthreadgt  class Controller  public QObject      QOBJECT     QPROPERTYData data READ data NOTIFY dataChanged  public     explicit ControllerQObject parent  nullptr          QObjectparent         ,runningfalse         ,datanullptr              data  new Data           virtual Controller          delete data           void start          running  true         thread  stdthread[this]  threadFunc            void stop          running  false          if thread.joinable              thread.join                    Data data          return data       signals     void dataChanged  private     void threadFunc          while running              stdthisthreadsleepforstdchronomilliseconds10             data.setSomeDatafoo             emit dataChanged                    bool running     stdthread thread     Data data    Controller   File main.qml import QtQuick 2.0  Rectangle      width 100     height 100      Text          anchors.centerIn parent         text Controller.data.someData       codepre  pData is a simple container holding a QString as property.

However both activities seem to share a namespace or something, because the newly launched one is not able to get the WebView UI up and running. So this seemed to be leading me nowhere.p  pWhat I have now done is implement a check for intent before I start my app properly. If it was started with an intent I just store the data of the .custom file in my App.Properties and then try to close the currently running instance of the app via codeTi.Android.currentActivity.finishcode. However the Activity or something else seems to still be running, because when I open the app back up even if it was running while I did the other things, once I select it in the task manager it starts up from the beginning only bad things happen Every call from the WebView to the app and vice versa gets made more than once depending on how often the App has been started after the first opening of the .custom file. This obviously makes the app unusable because nothing works.p  pEven killing the app in the task manager does not always reset everything so that a call only gets made once.p  pCan anyone guess whats up herep  pOr even better give me guidelines on how to implement the use case properly While I do not fully understand the whole activity complex and how it interacts with appcelerator Id reckon that this may not happen if I wouldnt call my main launcher activity with the intent but another custom activity thats only responsible for importing the data from the .custom file and nothing else. But how does one create a custom activity with titaniump  pThanks for any help or nudge in the right directionp

What am I doing wrong here Has this been done before Is it possible herep
Negative 59817 pI was playing around with a simple function for someone elses Stack Overflow question, and wrote the expressionp  precodef a x  f a y codepre  pObviously this is the best way to write that expression in real life, given I have all those variables in scope anyway, but I saw the duplication of codef acode, and thought Hey, maybe you can remove that with the Applicative instance for functions. I wound up with p  precodeliftA2  flip f x flip f y a codepre  pwhich is just awful. Is there some nicer way to remove this duplicationObviously I could also remove the duplication by binding codef acode to something in a codewherecode clause, but this was intended as an exercise in using builtin functions.p
