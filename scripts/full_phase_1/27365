Positive 27365 pI am building an app which contains a codeUITableViewControllercode with a list of languages. When I click on English for example, it will load up another codeUITableViewControllercode with a list of Videos available on a website for that language. The cells here will differ from clicking on French. So I have a Title and a URL for each video. Im not keeping the video within the app the user simply will click on one of the Titles and it will go to the website to play that video. p  pThere are about 1,100 videos, so putting this is code is quite painful. Essentially, from the codeprepareForSeguecode, I am calling a codeUITableViewControllercode and will display a number of cells depending on how many there are for that language. p  precode voidprepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue senderidsender      NSIndexPath indexPath  [self.languagesTabTableView indexPathForCellsender]     [self.languagesTabTableView deselectRowAtIndexPathindexPath animatedYES]      if [segue.identifier isEqualToStringShowingLeafletsAndVideosSegueChinese]              LeafletsAndVideosTableViewController lvtvc  LeafletsAndVideosTableViewControllersegue.destinationViewController         NSMutableArray availableLeafletsToPass  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithObjects3 Facts,10 Questions,nil]         NSMutableArray availableVideosToPass  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithObjects1,2, nil]         NSString theSelectedLanguage  Chinese          Calling the set methods on the LeafletsAndVideosTableViewController         [lvtvc setAvailableLeafletsavailableLeafletsToPass]         [lvtvc setAvailableVideosavailableVideosToPass]         [lvtvc setSelectedLanguagetheSelectedLanguage]           else if [segue.identifier isEqualToStringShowingLeafletsAndVideosSegueEnglish]              LeafletsAndVideosTableViewController lvtvc  LeafletsAndVideosTableViewControllersegue.destinationViewController         NSMutableArray availableLeafletsToPass  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithObjects3 Facts,nil]         NSMutableArray availableVideosToPass  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithObjectsVideo 1,Video 2, Video 3, Video 4, Video 5, Video 6, nil]         NSString theSelectedLanguage  English          Calling the set methods on the LeafletsAndVideosTableViewController         [lvtvc setAvailableLeafletsavailableLeafletsToPass]         [lvtvc setAvailableVideosavailableVideosToPass]         [lvtvc setSelectedLanguagetheSelectedLanguage]      codepre  pSo codeavailableVideosToPasscode is filled up with Titles and as long as its not nil, it will get shown in the codeLeafletsAndVideosTableViewControllercode without issues. What youre seeing above is just a small subset the videos have much longer titles and actually spread across 1,100 different videos. Thats 1,100 different titles. p  pIm quite new to this concept and I dont want to change this code around too much, but is there any way I can load in a file, like a text file, or a spreadsheet of titles The English selection is always going to have the 1,100 titles, so if I could essentially load in a file into the codeNSMutableArraycode codeavailableVideosToPasscode. p  pIf this is possible, how would I go about achieving this Ive never done anything like this before so Im not even sure what to look for online. p  pAny guidance on this would be really appreciated. p

Negative 27365 pI would appreciate opinions or suggestions.  p  pFor several years, I have had an html and javascript website that was housed on a shared Apache server hosted by Wild West.  Recently I decided to migrate it to .NET 3.5 and put it on a shared Windows IIS7 server also hosted by Wild West.  I rewrote all of the pages using Visual Studio 2008, added role management, a sitemapcontrolled menu tree with rolebased security trimming enabled, and secured directories.  There are maybe a half dozen pages with a couple of secured directories that have, at this point, just one or two files in each.  Simple site.  p  pI used VS2008s ASP.NET Configuration tool to create users and roles that match all of the role names in the sitemap and confirmed the users, etc, are in the aspnet tables in the AppDataASPNETDB.MDF database.  The site renders fine on local machine.  The Login.aspx page allows the user to log in, the menu tree adjusts accordingly, the login status control adjusts accordingly, and the user is redirected appropriately everything works as designed. p  pI took out the shared Windows hosting account with Wild West formerly GoDaddy, exported the ASPNETDB tables and data to a .sql file and recreated them on the MS SQL server, edited the connection string in web.config to use the connection string supplied by Wild West, then used FileZilla to ftpcopy the files and folders to the Windows server.  The .aspx pages will render with no problem but when I try to use any of the usernames and passwords to log in, a SQL exception is thrown.  This is the pretty vague exception messagep  pAn error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server. When connecting to SQL Server 2005, this failure may be caused by the fact that under the default settings SQL Server does not allow remote connections. provider SQL Network Interfaces, error 26  Error Locating ServerInstance Specified p  pWild Wests tech support had me delete and recreate the database ensuring that remote connections are allowed and they verified the connection string information is correct but the exception is still thrown when trying to login.  Now, heres the strange part, I can hard code the connection information into the codebehind of a page and it will successfully connect to the database to extract information.  So the database is reachable by the web server.  p  pSo, I began to wonder is the problem because I simply copied the pages, codebehind files, and folders to the server instead of building them and then copying the compiled version to the server  HTML is very different from .NET and Apache servers are very different from IIS7.  I had read somewhere that uncompiled sites copied to IIS7 would be compiled by the server on the first demand but maybe that isnt true.  The folder structure on the server does not include a BIN folder, which leads me to believe the server did not, in fact, build the site.  Should I delete the files and folders off of there, build the site on local machine, and then copy the built version back to the server  Could this be what is causing the error message  p  pThanks for any information you can give.  Have a happy holiday season.p  pJohnp

So far, I have been unable to find the compendium of information Im looking for.p  pHere are some sample questions Id like to find answers forp  ol liWhat are the best practices for input, validation, storage and display of address information for a global applicationbr  ul linumber of characters to store for address fields Did you know there is a city name that contains 163 charactersli livalidation of address datali ulli liWhat are the best practices for input, validation, storage and display of phone numbers for a global applicationli liSame question for a persons nameli ol  pSo far, our approach to these issues has been to allow ample storage for the various fields and to perform minimal input validation, relying on the user to get it right.  This approach is working OK at this stage in the project, but the various project stakeholders are not satisfied using this approach for the long term.  There is a strong desire for clean data, efficient storage and attractive data presentation for all locales.p  pAny recommendations out there for books, papers or websites that have a fairly complete handling of these and related topicsp

Negative 27365 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a MacAlly IceKey keyboard. This keyboard has volume buttons that require a driver to function. This driver has not been updated since 2006, and I suspect it as the source of a recent spat of recurring kernel panics Ive been experiencing under Mac OS X 10.6.1. So, out it goes but I want my volume keys backp  pUsing the wonderful a hrefhttpcontrollermate.com relnofollowControllerMatea, I can program these keys to do anything, including run an applescript script. So, Im trying to implement that functionality.p  pThe set volume command part of Standard Additions allows you to set the volume to any value between 0 and 100. The Apple keyboard volume keys allow a total of 17 volume settings to be selected including 0. I figure the simplest way to duplicate this behavior is to keep a list of allowed volume settings and grab the next largest or smallest one out of that.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pIt doesnt work. The following scriptp  precodeset volumesList to 0, 6, 12, 18, 25, 31, 37, 43, 50, 56, 62, 68, 75, 81, 87, 93, 100 set sysVolume to get volume settings  repeat with curVolume in volumesList     if curVolume gt output volume of sysVolume then     set volume output volume contents of curVolume     exit repeat     end if end repeat  get volume settings codepre  p...only works if the system volume level happens to be less than 43. The system seems to interpret 50 as 49 thats as high as the volume will go with my script. If the volume emstartsem higher than 50, my script has no effect. The kicker If the exit repeat statement is removed, the system volume gets set to 100  just as youd expect.p  pGood grief, AppleScript is emweirdem sometimes.p  pAny ideasp  pstrongBonus Pointsstrongp  pIt would be super awesome to get this to display the volume overlay as well. Does anyone know how to accomplish that It doesnt even need to be through AppleScript Im happy sticking some Cocoa code in a commandline tool if thats what it takes.p  pThanksp

Seeing as I do not know the actual OpenID url a user has until I have authenticated them ie. for google accounts everyone enter the same URL, but after authenticated my site recieves a different URL, I do not know if I am to ask for Name, Website, Email or not  and I am struggling with how I am supposed to present this in a proper way.p  pI know there are probably not a magical solution to this  but does anyone have any good ideas as to how the workflow of this process could workp  pI have considered simply updating a users profile if they have an account, but I could see that being annoying as well as users might not be able to remember that they have an account. I simply cannot wrap my head around how to get this to work in a nice and obvious way for the user.p  pAny input is greatly appreciated.p  pForgot to say, the problematics can be seen running my development version of this  a hrefhttpdev.blogger.kaareskovgaard.net relnofollowhttpdev.blogger.kaareskovgaard.neta . Go to any of the recent nonsense posts and try to comment as an anonymous user. Then try to comment and provide an OpenID URL as well. Now if you try to comment again while being logged in you will only be asked to provide an actual comment. Lastly log out again and now enter the same OpenID Url  now you are still being required to fill out Display Name, Website and Email  this is the bit that annoys me.p

Negative 27365 pSo I have recently started playing with Ubuntu, PHP, and CakePHP and have been pretty happy with the LAMP stack.  Except now Im trying to build a simple web page that can display collected data in a graph.  Apparently OpenFlashChart2 with the FlashChartHelper plugin is pretty good, but I cannot get it to actually display a graph.  I got the hello world sample described in the OpenFlashChart2 documentation to work, but when I try the FlashChartHelper samples I just get a blank spot where my graph is supposed to be.  There is no error message, just... nothing.  I verified that all the files are installed as listed on the page, and I made sure to define helpers in my controllerp  pvar helpers  arrayHtml, Form, Flash,FlashChart p  pCould it be a pathing issue  My webroot is varwww, but I unzipped cake into varwwwwww2 .  The rest of my site, including entering data, works just fine.p  pHas anyone else seen this before  What did you do to resolve the issue  Failing that, can you recommend another graphing library  Specifically, I need to render a scatter graph.  I have a collection of data points that are collected at irregular intervals.  Either suggestions on fixing FlashChartHelper or another library would be appreciatedp

Negative 27365 pI am using Ivy to resolve my dependencies.  We have a big share space where all the libraries we use live and are retrieved from as needed.p  pVery occasionally we need to add some additional files to an existing library version.  For example we recently started to use the charting components in a UI library.  We hadnt previously needed them so I took the relevant DLLs and copied them into the share space with the existing UI DLLs.p  pHowever running ivy doesnt pick these additions up by default, presumably because they are locally cached on my machine and ivy only does a version check to see whether it already has version x.y.z of library a.  It doesnt check whether version x.y.z of library a has changed in the ivy repository.p  pIs there a way of getting ivy to check the repository for structural changes to a library rather than just checking the local cachep  pI tried using codeltivyresolve refreshtruegtcode but that didnt seem to do anything.p  pThanks.p

Negative 27365 pIve already asked similar question on this issue on stack overflow already, but I believe this part of the issue can be separated into a new question.p  pIve not done mobile development before so the use of signing and certificates is a new concept to me, and for all the reading of topics I have done, its not really improved my knowledge as each website I read talks only about a small part of signing, not the complete process, and piecing it all together has been difficult.p  pThe issue I have is my driver is not been loaded at startup on WM6.1. Its a driver for GPS so needs to be loaded so its available to any GPS software accessible on a COM port. I believe this is due to a signing issue, given that the DllMain method is never called.p  pI have been given a privileged certificate .pfx to use, and for the record have also got the new Jan 2010 SDKSamplePrivDeveloper certificate as well. I assume a privileged certificate is needed for drivers.p  pSo what have I actually done. Ive tried atleast several variations on this over the last 45 days all with no success.p  pIn visual studio 1The DLL project has authenticode signing set to our .pfx certificate. Build the project.p  p2The CABWizard project has authenticode set to the same certificate. Build the project.p  p3Following the MSDN instructions... Converted the .pfx into a 509 Base64 Certificate, and created an XML provisioning file from it.. It has been created into its own CAB Or CPF file. And also tried provisioning the setup.xml file into the previously created CAB file so its installed with the application.p  p4I have installed these onto the device, and whilst the driver does work in our test app it does not load at boot even though its registry settings in BuiltIn are correct. When checking the certificate stores in the registry I can see the certificate added to the SPC, Root, Privileged and Unprivileged stores. And when using SystemCertificates I can see the certificate in Root tab. So they have definitely been added.p  pGiven the above did not work. I have also tried the siggner.exe tool from a hrefhttpwww.modaco.comcontenti8000verizonschi920omniaiihttpi8000modacocom306870sdkcerts2010andsigningtool relnofollowhttpwww.modaco.comcontenti8000verizonschi920omniaiihttpi8000modacocom306870sdkcerts2010andsigningtoola with the SDKSamplePrivDeveloper certificate.p  p1The Dll project has authenticode signing set to No. Build the project.p  p2Load up siggner.exe and sign the Dll file with SDKSamplePrivDeveloper.cer.p  p3The CABWizard project has authenticode set to No. Build the project.p  p4Load up siggner.exe and sign the cab file with SDKSamplePrivDeveloper.cer.p  p5 Use NewSDKCerts.Cab to install the SDKSamplePrivDeveloper certificate into the stores.p  p6 Install the CAB file i created with the driver.p  p7 Again, on a warm reboot the driver is not loaded at boot into device.exe.p  pGiven the above, can anyone give me some clear instructions on a sure fire way to load the driver at startup. Im obviously doing something wrong with the signing given this does boot up without an issue in Windows CE5. I know the device driver code is OK as I can activate it manually in code with ActiviateDevice method in WM6.1.p  pEditp  pIt maybe worth adding, I also created a DLL and CAB with no signing at all. And on a clean boot of the OS it installed without complaining. Whilst still not loading at boot I did expect warnings about the CAB and DLL been unsigned.p

These could be used for grouping and containing routes.  Usually our routes contain about 100 grids in a semitight grouping.p

Negative 27365 pIve read a variety of recommendations on this, and just am curious what the state of the art would be for this p  pIve built a traditional thick client wpf, actually application which is using datasets strongly typed as the data layer used inmemory during the lifespan of the app, and binary serialized and compressed to store to a file. The file doenst need to have any compatability with other apps etc, so I have the freedom to choose whatever storage mechanism I choose. The app does also communicate with webservices, which it is currently using this same strongly typed dataset for. p  pThe app includes all kinds of data in this file, from included images, to rather long lists of numeric values potentially over 100k doubles, to basic text etc. p  pSo, if I wanted to modernize this app, Id probably prefer to use various generic lists of objects for the data layer inmemory, which could then still be binary serialized out to a file. But are there better ways I know using a database for the file would allow me to update specific items only, instead of reserializing the whole thing, but right now Im not having to deal with the headache of figuring out which items have changed and need updating etc. And if I do stick with just serializing everything, are there better or more standardizedopen ways to do this  something like protocol buffers or bson comes to mind. p  pIll observe some answers and add any clarification here if needed. TIA. p

Negative 27365 pIm getting increasingly frustrated with doing the authentication right. Usually Im using terms that Im not familiar with so answerers misunderstand my questions. Its not helped bu the fact that this is a case with many implementations.p  pSo now Im going to try to explain the facts and requirements surrounding my project so that I might get a pointer towards a good solution.p  pI will have a Database that includes the information I need. Included in this info will be the usernames and salted hash of passwords. This database will be connected to a WCF web service that supplies the data to other front end projects.p  pOne of the front end projects is a asp.net MVC 3 web site that users will use to log in and such. Now the default in such a project is some sort of SQlMembership that is not right in this case as this site is not connected to the database it might not even be a MSQL database.p  pHere are implementations that I looked at but couldnt quite figure how to use correctly.p  p1 Write my own MembershipProvider in the MVC project that would query the WebService for validation. Here I mean that it would just call some methods for all its needs. Not liking it for security issues, client side solution.p  p2 Validata using a service side MembershipProvider but then I would have to send userName Password with each action and I cant store password for security reasons.p  p3 Then I discovered something called WCF authenticationService a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.applicationservices.authenticationservice.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.applicationservices.authenticationservice.aspxa and it seemed to be what I need but Im having problem understanding how it works. I want it to be part of my service but it seems to be a dedicated service. Also its not really explaining how it authenticates I need to have a custom authentication based on my table, not some default table created for me. Here is a post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6003489shouldauthenticationbeinaseparateserviceforwcfShould authentication be in a separate service for wcfa with same problem that Im not sure how got solved.p  pCan the WCF authentication service be the right tool for mep  pCan you answer this for someone who doesnt know asp.net, web or service terminologyp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHere is one solution that I was hoping for but not sure if exists.p  pThe WCF Service exposes a MembershipProvider, RoleProvider, ProfileProvider that are defined in the service.p  pIn the MVC web.config under membershipprovidersadd the MembershipProvider is added along with a endpoint towards the service. Same with RoleManager etc.p  pSo when I call MembershipProvider in the MVC project to validate user it automatically calls the service and checks there and when it happens upon a Authorize attribute it as well checks the RoleProvider in the service automatically.p  pI would however also want to restrict the service calls themselves, even if they are inside a [Authorized] attribute method it might not be so in other clients that reference the web service. Would love if when a call comes from a website the service would automatically have access to the forms.authentication cookie.p

Negative 27365 pI have a problem when using the new Entity Framework 4.1.

Since they are both the same version, I copied the consoleapp and consoleext directories from serverlib and put them under this servers serverlib. p  pSo when I restart Weblogic, it does find consoleapp when I point to a hrefhttplocalhost7001console relnofollowhttplocalhost7001consolea and actually tries to deploy it the first time. However, I get a 503  Service unavailable. From the stacktrace, basically it looks like it couldnt load the console webapp.  In other words, my trial for hacking it did not work p  pWhen I checked again on the Oracle site, I see 2 exes for Weblogic Workshop 10.3 on Windows Oracle Workshop for WebLogic 10.3  Net Installer amp Oracle Workshop for WebLogic 10.3  Package Installer.

Negative 27365 pI am constantly developing my rails app and deploying about once every 1 or 2 weeks. I have a lot of content that I would like to be cached for quite awhile. I switched to using rails filestore for caching since the other caching options store the cache in memory which goes away when I have to restart passenger. The problem I am having is that every time I deploy an update, I loose my cache anyway even though it is file based. Is there a way to prevent the cache from clearing when you deploy an update for a rails app I am using capistrano for deployment and git for version control.p

Negative 27365 pIm just curious as to why this choice was made  it basically rules out changing the compression algorithm used by Git  because it doesnt use the SHA1 of the raw blobs. Perhaps there is some efficiency consideration here. Maybe ZLIB is faster at compressing a file than the SHA1 algorithm is at creating the hash, so therefore compressing before hashing is faster p  pHere is a link to the original Git READMEby Linus a hrefhttpgit.kernel.orgpgitgit.gitablobfREADMEh27577f76849c09d3405397244eb3d8ae1d11b0f3hbe83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290httpgit.kernel.orgpgitgit.gitablobfREADMEh27577f76849c09d3405397244eb3d8ae1d11b0f3hbe83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290ap  pAnd here is the relavent paragraphp  pThere are several kinds of objects in the contentaddressable collection database.

Negative 27365 pIm working on an app for a band, which consists of several different activities such as an agenda, news section, album section et cetera. Since its for a band, I would like to play the bands songs in the background. p  pThis isnt such a problem, but I would like to show a small music player on the bottom of all activities so users can always stop, skip, or replay a song if they want to. An example of this can be found in the apps of Mobile Roadie, for instance.p  pHowever I have no idea how to do this. My best guess is creating a music player class with its own layout, and including this at the bottom of each activitylayout. But since every activity starts in its own thread, Im guessing this would reset the player for each activity.p  pSo, how would I go about adding a common music player to all of my activities, where the state of the music player would be maintained p  pFor an example, download any of the music based apps of Mobile Roadie and youll know what I mean.p  hr  pI decided on using Fragments, but Im not sure if I can use those in already existing activities. All the examples I found focus on completely new projects, and not already existing ones.

Negative 27365 pI am banging my head against something and I was wondering if somebody more skilled that me could help me out.p  pMy aim is to create a comment thread that factors in a system of comment scoring.p  pFirst Ill explain where I am currently.p  pSay we have a comment thread on an article that looks like the example below. The number in parenthasis is the ID of that comment. IDs are assigned automatically by the database and increment chronologically with each additional comment posted. The number of dashes before the comment text reperesent the comment depth.p  precode01This is a top level comment.  02This is a second level comment. A reply to the top level comment above. 06This is also a second level comment  another reply to comment 01. 07This is a reply to comment 06. 03This is a different top level comment. 05This is a reply to the comment above. 08This is a reply to that comment in turn. 10This is a deeper comment still. 04This is one more top level comment. 09This is one more reply. codepre  pMy first problem was storing this data in a way that means it can be returned in the correct order. If you simply store a depth field and order by depth, itll bring back all of the top level comments first and then the second level comments etc. This isnt right, we must return the comments with the full parentage still intact.p  pOne way to achieve this is to store the full parentage for each comment.p  precodeComment ID   Parentage      01                   Comment 01 has no parent because it is top level      02      01          Comment 02 was a reply to comment 01      03            04                         05      03      06      01      07      0106       Comment 07 has two ancestors 01 and then 06      08      0305      09      04      10      030508 codepre  pAdding another comment record is as simple as grabbing the Parentage from the comment that you are replying to, and appending its ID to form the new parentage. For example, if I was replying to comment 10, I would take its parentage 030508 and append its ID 10. The database would automatically recognise it as the 11th comment, and wed getp  precodeComment ID   Parentage      01            02      01       03            04                         05      03      06      01      07      0106      08      0305      09      04      10      030508      11      03050810 codepre  pNow, when we order the comments for display, we order on a concatenation of Parentage and Comment ID which gives usp  precodeOrder by CONCATParentage, ID  Comment ID   Parentage       CONCATParentage, ID      01                      01      02      01             0102      06      01             0106      07      0106          010607      03                      03      05      03             0305      08      0305          030508      10      030508       03050810      11      03050810    0305081011      04                      04      09      04             0409 codepre  pWhich produces the exact same list as first demonstrated. With Comment 11 which we later added inserted in the correct placep  precode01This is a top level comment.  02This is a reply to the top level comment. 06This is another reply that was posted later than the first. 07This is a reply to the second level comment directly above. 03This is a different top level comment. 05This is a reply to the comment above. 08This is a reply to the comment above. 10This is a deeper comment still. 11THIS COMMENT WAS ADDED IN THE EARLIER EXAMPLE. 04This is one more top level comment. 09This is one more reply. codepre  pIndenting can be done by checking the length of the CONCAT string and multiplying the lenCONCATParentage, ID by a set number of pixels. This is great, we have a system of storing comments in a way that recognises their parentage.p  pNow the problemp  pNot all comments are equal. A system of comment scoring is needed to distinguish good comments. Lets say each comment has an upvote button.. while we want to retain parentage, if one comment has two direct replies at the same level then we want to show the one with the most upvotes first. Ill add some votes in [square brackets] below.p  precode01This is a top level comment. [6 votes] 02This is a reply to the top level comment. [2 votes] 06This is another reply that was posted later than the first. [30 votes] 07This is a reply to the second level comment directly above. [5 votes] 03This is a different top level comment. [50 votes] 05This is a reply to the comment above. [4 votes] 08This is a reply to the comment above. [0 votes] 10This is a deeper comment still. [0 votes] 11THIS COMMENT WAS ADDED IN THE EARLIER EXAMPLE. [0 votes] 04This is one more top level comment. [2 votes] 09This is one more reply. [0 votes] codepre  pIn this example, comments 01 and 03 are both toplevel but 03 has [50 votes] and 01 only has [6 votes]. 01 appears above only by virtue of the fact that it was posted earlier and therefore has been assigned a smaller ID. Likewise 02 and 06 are both replies to 01 but must be reordered to allow the one with the most votes 06 to rise to the top.p  pI am completely and utterly stuck in trying to achieve this.p  pI imagine that any orderingreordering and indexing would be better done on a commentvote being cast rather than on page load so that the pageload time can be as quick as possible but beyond that I have absolutely no ideap  pAny ideas or light you could shed on possible avenues would really take a load off Thanks for your help as always.p  h2h2  pEdit In response to Paddys solution,p  pWhen I run the expression offered by Paddy below on the mock data, the first error I get is p  precodeThe ORDER BY clause is invalid in views, inline functions, derived tables, subqueries, and common table expressions, unless TOP or FOR XML is also specified.  codepre  pThis can be remedied by adding SELECT top 100 percent to the recursive member definition.

Basically, the page CSS is conflicting with the inline CSS generated by the text editor, which caused issues for things like tables.p  pCurrently I am solving this on the preview page by placing the preview in an iframe but I am not entirely sure the best way to do this for the actual editor page.

Negative 27365 pIm working on an iPhone app in objectivec also using cocos2d for graphics.  I have a large sprite and I have done research on how to scale the sprite and my code looks like this...p  precodeSet up sprite      Use batch node.

I cant find the problem.  Its probably something amature.  Looking back there are warnings after those last to lines that reads CCTexture2d may not respond to setScaleX.

Negative 27365 pI have a Show in folder button which executes the followingp  precodeexplorer.exe select,Cdirsomefile.txt codepre  pIn Win7 this works great, a new window is always opened, but in XP, if Cdir is already open, this window is reused but the selection is not changed to somefile.txt. p  pThis is not the expected behaviour from the point of view of the user, he expects to see somefile.txt, but instead sees another file, and that might confuse him. At worst, he might assume that something went wrong and the file was not created.p  pSo I need to somehow force Explorer in XP to always select the file I give it in the cmd line, or not to reuse the window. p  pCan anyone suggest a way to do this different cmd parameters, maybe COM automationp

Negative 27365 pWe currently have 2 MVC web applications running completely independently of each other. The aim is to tie these 2 sites together in some sort of Intranet with shared authorisation etc. and some sort of home page linking to each.p  pSo far we have created a 3rd MVC application and added both of the existing sites as MVC areas to this, which works nicely. Weve also managed to separate each area into their own Visual Studio projects under a single solution.p  pEach of the 2 areas are specced by completely different departments of the business and usually developed by different developers and will need to follow independent release cycles. p  pThe current approach is to have each area in separate repository paths and have the build server checkout the appropriate branch for each area, build the main web application Intranet home page thing which will in turn build the referenced area projects. The problem with this is we have to always deploy all 3 projects each time, even if just one area wants a release.p  pThis isnt a massive deal assuming we dont accidentally deploy a new, untested release of the main intranet web app along with the area but it also means that the build server will stamp emallem assemblies of a particular build with the same version number.p  pA second approach was for the main intranet project to reference only the assemblies of the area projects and not the projects themselves, so it could be built on its own without having to build each area again or vise versa. 2 problems with this, I cant see a way with MS WebDeploy used by the buildserver to publish our code to publish just certain assemblies. Secondly, MVC areas in separate assemblies seemingly need to be added as project references and not just assembly references as views dont dynamically compile properly missing Viewsweb.configp  pAre there any better approaches to this p  pEDIT Ive managed to get the main web application to run with regular assembly references to the areas and not project references not entirely sure how, it just works. This means I can now build the areas independently of the main app as required.p  pThe next problem is a deploying the whole lot with MSDeploy. The area assembly is deployed with the main app in the bin directory but the areas viewsscriptscontent are not included. Im looking at various techniques for compiling views into the assemblies themselves but cant seem to get this working yet. p
Negative 27365 pI know that properties kind of encapsulate getter and setter methods. So whenever we say myObject.property1 we actually cause to call [myObject property1]. From Apple documentation, Stanford iOS Courses and sample codes I can see that the usage of properties are encouraged. I aggree that using properties make a code look better and more understandable but what about performance If I write a huge application will using properties have a noticableimpact on performance Do professionals generally prefer direct setter and getter methods or propertiesp

Negative 27365 pI am trying to come up with an algorithm to tell the difference between water and land. I have a 2D array holding only 0sblack squares and 1sgrey squares, which produces this image. I colored one of the water areas blue so you can see what is supposed to be water. Water are the areas that are large and have a round shape. I colored some land areas green. All of the straight black lines are supposed to be land as well as some of the smaller round shapes. p  pRight now, all the black areas are represented as 0 and all grey areas as 1. So in the picture, the green and blue spots are both represented as being the same thing. I need some of the black areaswater to be represented as 2 instead. What is a good way to do this The best thing I came up with so far is to calculate the area of each black spot, and only allow areas above a certain threshold to be water. I think there are better ways though and am wondering what you guys think.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comi8UFq.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 27365 pI am loading very large textures from JPG format, pre iOS5 I would use the Apple sample Texture2D class to convert the JPG texture to RGB565 format from RGB888 to halve the memory space needed. It would then get uploaded to the GPU wglTexImage2D in RGB565 format.p  pWith iOS5 I am converting calls to use the new GLKTextureLoader. However it seems like even though JPGs have no alpha channel, its just using RGB888 and therefore taking up twice the memory in GPU.p  pIs there a way to get GLKTextureLoader to use RGB565 when uploading to the GPU Im using [GLKTextureLoader textureWithContentsOfFilejpgFile] right now. I also tried [GLKTextureLoader textureWithContentsOfDatadata] and passing it an NSData of a raw RGB565 bitmap, but I get an error GLKTextureLoaderErrorKeyImage decoding failed when I try that. p

Negative 27365 pI read in a few articles that raw pointers should almost never be used. Instead they should always be wrapped inside smart pointers, whether its scoped or shared pointers.p  pHowever, I noticed that frameworks like Qt, wxWidgets and libraries like Boost never return nor expect smart pointers, as if they were not using them at all. Instead, they return or expect raw pointers. Is there any reason for that Should I stay away from smart pointers when I write a public API, and whyp  pJust wondering why smart pointers are recommended when many major projects seem to avoid them.p

Negative 27365 pIm creating a rails gem that adds functionality to Rails fieldsfor method, and Id like it to be callable from any form builder.

Negative 27365 pI am still learning the MVVM patern and I am atm making a new projectC4.0 amp WPF which invloves SQLite databases. I dont got alot expierience with databasessql in the past, but what I would do is something like. Select  from persons then loop throught the result and foreach result add it in the persons class, something like result[0]  person.name resulta hrefhttpsgithub.comrobconerymassiveblobmasterMassive.Sqlite.cs relnofollow1a  person.id and so on and so on and then just do a for loop until I looped all the rows and add all the players to a Listor ObservableCollection for MVVM. Now I want to be more dynamic, since I ll have many more rows I am kinda looking for something like. Person personone  Select  from persons where ID  1 But ofc this doesn t work . I have been googleing a bit but no real luck in finding such a thing, I found SQL to LINQ but it is not realy the thing I want I think the most intersting I found is the a hrefhttpsgithub.comrobconerymassiveblobmasterMassive.Sqlite.cs relnofollowmassive sqlite classa but It doesn t seem to work with VS11since I need the ADO.net SQLite thingie wich isn t updated since a few years making it incombatible with VS11p  pI hope you understand what my problem is and have a solution.

Negative 27365 pI need to detect when an image is moved. The point is that my page has a related HTML element another image to the first one that depends on its position.

I have an image call it AUX, position absolute that is situated in function of another image position image BASE. BASE and AUX dont share anything in the HTML except the BODY element, so its not possible to use position relative or similar. So, I have a function that gets BASE position and computes AUX position. The problem is when the page is loaded function is called when document is loaded and BASE has a position different from the final position when other elements are loaded, like other images, javascript functions, etc, BASE changes its position. This makes AUX have an invalid position it was valid, but not yet.p

Negative 27365 pI have a question regarding WMI and Storage Spaces.p  pSetup I have created a Storage Pool that contains a virtual disk that in turn contains 3 physical disks. I am using parity, which requires me to have a minimum of three disks to create the virtual disk.

The AddPhysicalDisk method returns a strongcache out of date 40003strong error.

Could someone tell me why this error is occurringp  pOther data I have tried to use the same physical disk to expand the pool instead of the Virtual Disk and this works fine. The problem with that approach is that I cant expand the virtual disk to take that additional disk into the picture. p

Negative 27365 pUsing parameters instead of placing values directly in the query string is done to prevent SQL injection attacks and should always be a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentbookdoctrine.html relnofollowdoneap  precode...

Negative 27365 pEssentially I have a file with a list of products I would like to add to my shopify store, Im fairly certain its formatted correctly although if it isnt please tell me what to fix. I was wondering how using a POST request through a private app I could get these onto my store. The file looks like this p  precode product      title TITLE HERE,     bodyhtml DESCRIPTION HERE,     vendor VENDOR HERE,     producttype PRODUCT TYPE HERE,     variants          option1 Default,         price PRICE HERE     ,     images          src LINK TO IMAGE HERE      , product      title TITLE HERE,     bodyhtml DESCRIPTION HERE,     vendor VENDOR HERE,     producttype PRODUCT TYPE HERE,     variants          option1 Default,         price PRICE HERE     ,     images          src LINK TO IMAGE HERE      , product      title TITLE HERE,     bodyhtml DESCRIPTION HERE,     vendor VENDOR HERE,     producttype PRODUCT TYPE HERE,     variants          option1 Default,         price PRICE HERE     ,     images          src LINK TO IMAGE HERE      , codepre  pand so on...  This file is named products.json. Is there any POST request that would allow me to just submit this file, or would I have to process and break it down somehow and feed it to the API using PHP or Ruby...I spent the greater part of a day extracting all 500 products out of a corrupted MySQL CMS backup and getting them all cleaned up in JSON using PHP and some regex, so a pain free solution would be much appreciated. p

Negative 27365 pI have a base that is inherited twice.

Since TGateControl is inherited from TControlObject and TAndControl class is inherited from TGateControl, the method clone should automatically be overridden for the base class clone method.

Negative 27365 pIn my app, Ive noticed that as I push and pop a view controller containing an codeMKMapViewcode, memory usage steadily increases. Ive determined that there is a problem with MapKit itself, not my code, though. I made a test project containing simply a navigation controller in which I repeatedly can push and pop a view controller containing nothing but a map view no annotations or overlays. As I push and pop the view controller over and over, memory usage increases by about .6 MB each pushpop cycle. Any thoughts as to why this is happening I am using ARC.

Negative 27365 pWe have an MVC website that was calling through to WCF Restful services but we are now replacing them with Web Api calls.  The problem is that existing code in some of the MVC controllers is relying on the type attribute being returned for each object in the JSON so it can do different things depending on the type of the object.p  pHowever, in the new Web Api responses, each of the objects returned dont have the type entries in the JSON so the code is failing.p  pDoes anyone know how this is done  Ive found plenty about removing the type entries for WCF services but nothing yet for making sure theyre in for Web Api.p

Negative 27365 pPlease accept my apology if this is something terribly obvious that I am simply missing.

Any advice you can provide would be appreciated.p  pEdit My code is attached below.  Of course Ive erased sensitive information such as my API key and project number, but the core code is here.  If I run this just once, it doesnt produce enough calls per minute to trigger an error.  I have to run it about 34 times simultaneously to produce the error.  One might say well dont do that.  While correct, the point of this exercise is to produce the error, so running it four times simultaneously is good.p  pWhen you do so with a valid API key and project number, occasionally you will get this errorp  precodeerrors[messageYou have made too many requests recently.

Negative 27365 pThis issue came up while maintaining an application written in CakePHP 1.3. Please bear in mind that while I can and do read the docs, my experience with Cake is quite limited.p  pThe application has a Widget model and a WidgetController. When editing a Widget, one option the user has is to massively import data into the Widget in one of three modes add to, remove from, or replace the widget data with what is imported.p  pThe current implementation is a total mess there is an edit action which performs all the 10 or so different mutation functions a Widget supports it decides what to do exactly by sniffing the parameters from the submitted form, so I broke the massive stuff into a new actionp  precodefunction batchid       massively apply data to Widget id either add, remove or replace  codepre  pThis action is triggered by a form in the edit viewp  precode Only relevant elements shown echo formgtcreateWidget, arrayenctypegtmultipartformdata, action gt batch gt echo formgtinputid echo formgtinputaction, arraytypegtselect,     optionsgtarray         appendgtAppend, true,          replacegtReplace existing, true,          deletegtDelete specified, true      echo formgtend gt codepre  pAs it stands, this form bundles the codeactioncode parameter into the codeWidgetcode array and the only way I can get hold of that from the controller is with codethisgtdata[Widget][action]code.p  pThis is ugly and semantically wrong, so I hope theres a better way to do it.p  pIdeally I d want to submit to the URL codewidgetbatchXappendcode, but thats not possible because the codeappendcode part is not fixed. So I d settle with any of thesep  ul lisomehow pass the action as a controller parameter like codeidcodeli lisomehow pass the action as a named parameter, allowing codethisgtparams[named][action]codeli lisome other way that does not require installing a custom route and does not require JavaScriptli ul  pCan Cake 1.3 do thisp

Negative 27365 pI have an app which uses codeCLLocationManagercode to track the users route, drawing dots along the path taken. The app runs in the background using Required background modes  App registers for location updates.p  pAs I understand, anything that happens in the background needs to be called from codelocationManagerdidUpdateToLocationfromLocationcode as this is the method that gets called with each location update.p  pThe problem Im having is that sometimes this stops getting called. It seems to happen when the users location does not change much within the space of maybe 15 minutes or so. As far as I can tell, calls to locationManagerdidUpdateToLocationfromLocation just stop, presumably to save the battery. Unfortunately, it doesnt resume again when youre back on the move.p  pI presume theres no way to override this behaviour, so I would like to use Notification Centre to inform the user that the app is no longer recording the route. The problem is, how can the app know that this has happened If locationManagerdidUpdateToLocationfromLocation is not called, I cant fire my notification. If it is being called, the notification should not fire.p  pIs there some kind of system notification that says location updates will ceasep  pIm finding it quite hard to debug this as I cant take my Mac everywhere when Im out and about testing the location on the device theres only so much you can do in the simulator. Any tips for debugging would also be much appreciatedp

Negative 27365 pI have a customer who wants to implement SSO using SAML2 assertion based approach. The customer will be the Identity Provider IDP and my application will effectively be the Service Provider SP.p  pIn the past Ive implemented SSO solutions where the IDP was Oracle Access Manager and therefore we were provided with the idp.xml file which allowed us to configure our SP environment using the supplied Fedlet. This conveniently created a relevant WAR file which, when deployed, allowed me to distribute the sp.xml file to the customer who imported it into their IDP. This all worked fine and I understand the concepts i.e. We receive the initial request, the fedlet handles this and takes the user to the IDP where they authenticate, then theyre passed back to our SP with a SAML response which the Fedlet allows us to parse and extract some data identifying the user. I then do whats required to sign them into our application.p  pHowever the current requirement is not using any backend framework to provide the IDP, theyve stated that its custom built one. Theyve given me the IDP URL and a cert file and are asking for our AssertionConsumerServiceURL and AudienceURI.p  pThe application which Im enabling SSO for is largely Java based. My investigation so far has led me to Forgerocks OpenAM solution as well as Shibboleths OpenSAML. However Im struggling with the first step, essentially where do what I start building a custom SP application connecting to a third party IDP using OpenAMShibbolethAnotherFramework.p  pAny pointers would be very useful.p  pThanks, Leep

Example of what Im trying to do a hrefhttppastebin.comFadCVH0h relnofollowhttppastebin.comFadCVH0hap  pI could use a switch statement i believe but wondering if theres a better way.p

If I take out this line p  precodeltattribute nameClassPath valuejar.classpathgt codepre  pfrom this file p  precodenbprojectbuildimpl.xml         codepre  pThen Netbeans compiles the Jar correctly for a Webstart App. It does not create the codeClassPathcode atttribute in the codeMETAINFMANIFEST.MFcode file inside the Jar. After removing this the app works absolutely fine, no hangs and no bogus requests for files which do not exist.p  pNow I guess the question is, why does Netbeans do this And is there a proper work around rather than me hacking about XML config files Bear in mind Ive been using Java for about a week. I know nothing about ANTJava really.p

However, all operations for the other types are also valid on char , so if the caller forgets the last argument, the function silently matches the template instead, producing the wrong logic.p  pIs there any way I can force the usage of the overloaduse default arguments in function templatessomething that will allow for a different signature extra argument for a specific type without silently matching a lesser signaturep  pMore No access to C11 yet, but Im open to see a suggestion using it to help push for adoption.

Negative 27365 pIf anyone has experienced this or has any ideas it would be greatly appreciated...p  pIll get right to the point The system in question uses java6, tomcat6 and ibatisp  pSince upgrading the database from Mysql5.1 to Mysql5.5 the system has become unstable. Upon looking at jmap histo and analyzing memory dumps with jhat it is clear that the problem has to do with the JDBC side of the app.p  pThe system does on average 3,000 selectsinsertsupdates per second and it its busiest time of the day the Prepared Statement instance count is between 10 and 30.  The highest count weve seen during normal operation is just over 50.p  pWhats weird is that there is no pattern to the crashes, the system has crashed multiple times in the space of an hour and other times days could pass between crashes.p  pThe highest instance count observed during the crash was over 5 million.p  hr  pHere is some jhat data for JDBC4PreparedStatement from one of the memory dumps This dump was taken as we picked up the start of the crash only 200k instances at this point img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJ9Ryo.gif altenter image description herep

Negative 27365 pI have a few macroenabled Excel files .xlsm that all contain the same macro script. The macro prompts for some dates in a range then prints copies in a loop while changing the values in a few TextBoxes.p  pI am trying to automate this process with a VBA script so that I enter the data once and then open each file in turn and run the macro using the same data. Currently I am only able to open the Excel files and execute the macro, but it will prompt me for the required input each time. I do not know how to store these values from the macro run in the VBA script or how to insert it to macro runs on other files. Im mainly interested in the values of TxtDD, TxtMMM, and TxtYYYY.p  pI tried to copy the entire macro script to my VBA script, but it did not work.

But this would change in accordance with the size of the input string codestr0code, so every time the user runs it shehe can stream different sized strings to produce a set of codestr0.size2code string variables. The whole idea here is that Im trying to convert these strings codestr1code, ..., codestrncode into integers in a for loop or something later on, but I can do that myself.p
Negative 27365 pIn MySQL, if you have a MyISAM table that looks something likep  precodeCREATE TABLE table1  col1 INT10 UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT, col2 INT10 UNSIGNED NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY col2, col1  COLLATEutf8generalci ENGINEMyISAM codepre  pif you insert rows then the autoincrement base will be unique for every distinct col2 value. If my explanation isnt clear enough, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3804845autoincrementusageincompositekeythisa answer should explain better. InnoDB, however, doesnt follow this behavior. In fact, InnoDB wont even let you put col2 as first in the primary key definition. p  pMy question is, is it possible to model this behavior in InnoDB somehow without resorting to methods like MAXid1 or the likes The closest I could find is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6369152postgresqlautoincrementbasedonmulticolumnuniqueconstraint63699846369984thisa, but its for PostgreSQL.p  pedit misspelling in titlep

Negative 27365 pIm pretty sure this is impossible, but its awfully tempting.p  pIm working with tree structures, made of hashes within arrays within hashes, et cetera. The hierarchy bottoms out in symbols i. e., the leaves of the tree are all symbols. Im writing a method that takes one of these trees and replaces all instances of a specific symbol with another tree i. e. it extends the tree by replacing some leaves with another tree. The symbol could appear in many places all over the tree, and traversing the tree could be a heavy operation. Ruby stores symbols once, and then just puts pointers to it on the leaves. Is there any way I can take advantage of this fact by replacing the symbol at the pointer location with the other treep  pI should probably just learn C. p

Negative 27365 pWe are trying to run a cassandra cluster on AWSEC2 within a standard VPC footprint cassandra nodes on private subnets. Because this is AWS there is always a chance that an EC2 instance will terminate or reboot with no warning. I have been simulating this case on a test cluster and I am seeing things with the cluster that I thought a cluster was suppose to prevent. Specifically if a node reboots some data will go temporarily missing until the node completes its reboot. If a node terminates it appears that some data is lost forever.p  pFor my test I just did a bunch of writes using QUORUM consistency to some keyspaces then interrogate the contents of those keyspaces as I bring down nodes either through reboot or terminate. Im just using cqlsh SELECT to do the keyspacecolumn family interrogation of the cluster using ONE consistency level.p  pNote, even though I am performing no writes to the cluster while I am doing the SELECTs rows temporarily disappear when rebooting and can permanently go missing during termination.p  pI thought Netflix Priam might be able to help, but sadly it doesnt work in a VPC the last time I checked.p  pAlso, because we are using ephemeral storage instances there is no equivalent of shutdown so I cannot run any scripts during rebootterminate of an instance to perform a codenodetool decommissioncode or codenodetool removenodecode before an instance goes away. Terminate is the equivalent of kicking the plug out of the wall.p  pSince I am using a replication factor of 3 and quorumwrite that should mean that all data is written to at least 2 nodes. So, unless I am totally misunderstanding things which is possible, losing one node should not mean that I lose any data for any period of time when I am using consistency level ONE for the read.p  h1Questionsh1  pWhy wouldnt a 6 node cluster with a replication factor of 3 workp  pDo I need to run something like a 12 node cluster with a replication factor of 7 Dont bother telling me that will fix the problem, because it doesnt.p  pDo I need to use consistency level of ALL on the writes then use ONE or QUORUM on the readsp  pIs there something not quite right with virtual nodes unlikelyp  pAre there nodetool commands besides removenode that I need to run when a node terminates to recover missing data As mentioned earlier, when a reboot occurs, eventually the missing data reappears.p  pIs there some cassandra savant who can look at my cassandra.yaml file below and send me on the path to salvationp  h1More Info added 719h1  pI dont think this is a QUORUM vs ONE vs ALL is the issue. The test I set up performs no writes to the keyspaces after the initial population of the column families. So the data has had plenty of time hours to make it to all the nodes as required by the replication factor. Plus the test dataset is REALLY small 2 column families with about 3001000 values each. So in other words, the data is completely static.p  pThe behavior I am seeing seems to be tied to the fact that the ec2 instance is no longer on the network. The reason I say this is because if I log on to a node and just do a codecassandra stopcode I see no loss of data. But if I do the reboot or terminate I start getting the following in a stack trace.p  precodeCassandraHostRetryService   Downed Host Retry service started with queue size 1 and retry delay 10s CassandraHostRetryService   Downed Host retry shutdown complete CassandraHostRetryService   Downed Host retry shutdown hook called Caused by TimedOutException Caused by TimedOutException codepre  pSo it seems to be more of a networking communication issue in that the cluster is expecting, for example 10.0.12.74, to be on the network after it has joined the cluster. If that ip is suddenly unreachable either due to reboot or termination the timeouts start happening.p  pWhen I do a codenodetool statuscode under all three scenarios codecassandra stopcode, reboot or terminate the status of the node shows up as DN. Which is what you would expect. Eventually codenodetool statuscode will return to UN with codecassandra startcode or reboot, but obviously termination always stays DN.p  h1Details of my Configurationh1  pHere are some details of my configuration cassandra.yaml is at the bottom of this postingp  pNodes are running in private subnets of a VPC.p  pCassandra 1.2.5 with numtokens 256 virtual nodes. initialtoken blank.

Yet, when parse is run as is, all that gets printed out is begin parsing starting loop Array   the code that calls this function prints out the return value.

Im sure that Im making a stupid mistake somewhere, so any suggestions would be very appreciated.p

Negative 27365 pI have two rooms in which I maintain some source code using git, a dev room where most development happens and a deploy room in which we actually use the software.  Inevitably some changes happen in the deploy room as well.  Id like both rooms to share the same history in git.p  pbRestrictionsbp  ol liFor security reasons the two rooms are not network connected.li liOnly text files human readable can leave the deploy room.li ol  pMoving changes into the deploy room is simple using codegit bundlecode, and tracking the last commit we moved into the deploy room.  Moving changes out of the room is more difficult due to the textonly restriction.p  pbGoalb Move commits back and forth between my two unconnected rooms as if a codegit pullcode had happened, ii.e.i, identical SHA1 hashes in both rooms.p  pbSo Farbp  ul lipIve tried codegit formatpatchcode to move changes from deploy back to dev, but this doesnt record merges, and therefore requires a different patch set to be generated for each contiguous set of changes along with some record of how to reproduce the exact merge commit which happened in between.  There is some discussion a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2285699githowtocreatepatchesforamergeabout making diffs for merge commitsa, but this doesnt seem to capture the actual ancestry, only the changes.  It seems that patches may not be a rich enough format to provide the necessary information.pli lipSome bundletotext script could be used to convert the bundle into nonzipped and humanreadableish format, and then back again after downloading but I have found no evidence that such a script exists.pli lipPerhaps a script could be written to walk the history from some common ancestor to the newest commit and either a make a patch or b recreate the merge of some commonlyknown refs.pli ul  pbFallbackb  I could always squash the commits coming out of the deploy room into just one raw patch and break the history, but then further downloads from devdeploy would break any existing working copies.  Not ideal.p  pbUpdateb I believe codegit fastexportcode may do what I need, although most examples have it working on entire repositories and not partial histories like codegit bundlecode.  I have a working toy example in which I can export a partial history into an outofdate clone, but it requires me to handedit the fastexport output so that I add a codefrom ltsha1gtcode to the first commit.  Without this modification the import creates different sha1s and then complains with codeNot updating refsheadsmaster new tip lthashgt does not contain ltmasters hashgtcode.p  pbUpdate2b My codegit fastexportcode solution does work, but it has a bandwidth problem, since it works by providing entirely new files rather than diffs from previous files.  This is not acceptable since I actually have to read all those extra lines.p

Negative 27365 pI am currently experimenting with JavaScript and Im having trouble changing the style of the links on my landing page. What I have is four boxes in the top right of the page that when clicked change the theme of the landing page.

But i am stuck at this point where i want to convert the loaded color bitmap into monochrome on click of button  How can this be done  Can this be also done by manipulation of the RGBQUAD of the bitmap or in some other way. If with RGBQUAD what will be the COLOR VALUE of RGB in case of monochrome. Please also note that i am able to load the color image and then convert it to monochrome. Please take a note that this is a SDI MFC application. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 27365 pI have developed a mobile web application which allows the user to take a picture with their mobile device camera and then displays it on an HTML5 canvas.  When running this web application on an iPhone 5C under iOS 7, the image is severely vertically squished, so that it appears distorted and takes up approximately 20 of the canvas instead of taking 100 as intended.p  pThis may be related to Safari image subsampling, which also caused vertical squishing in earlier versions of iOS and on other devices, although not nearly as bad as what is being seen in the above issue.

Negative 27365 pPlease understand that Im still learning the concepts of C11s move and rvalue semantics. My question is whether legacy code can get a free lunch of avoiding unnecessary copy by simply using C11 compilers and STL.p  pHere is a very simple example. This code builds a simple character frequency table for a given string. For example, apple should return codea, 1, e, 1, l, 1, p, 2code. As you will see, Im just using vectors as values.p  precodetypedef stdtupleltchar, intgt Frequency typedef stdvectorltFrequencygt Frequencies  Frequencies buildFrequenciesTablestdstring w    char table[z  a  1]   0,    stdforeachw.cbegin, w.cend, [amptable]char c      table[tolowerc  a]       Frequencies freqs   for sizet i  0 i lt z  a  1 i      if table[i]  0       freqs.pushbacktupleltchar, intgtchar a  i, table[i]      return freqs  Q1 Is vector get copied   int main    using namespace std    Frequencies f1  buildFrequenciesTableapple  Q2 Copy   Frequencies f2  buildFrequenciesTablebanana   vectorltFrequenciesgt fs   f1, f2   Q3 Copy  codepre  pIt is clear that C03 generates all copy code using copy constructors and assignment operators when returning vectors as value. What about in C11 codestdvectorcode a has move constructor. Can this code get avoid any unnessarry copies Or, should I use either codeampampcode or codestdforwardcode in the above codep  pI tried to debug the internal STL code, but it was hard to convince.p  pNote My goal is to minimize any unnecessary copies in these functions. I know I could use newpointersreferences, but this will need to resolve memory leak problem. So, Id like to use values as much as possible.p

Negative 27365 pI am implementing an oauth 2 setup and have a use case that I am not quite sure how it applies to oauth 2. Hopefully someone here can set me on the right track.p  pMy platform consists of an api that I want to access from a mobile app. As I control both the app and api and also have users owning the data I figured the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant grant would fit in nicely. However on the app I want the user for now to only login via facebook. When I receive the uid and access token from facebook I would create a new user or update a current user in my api. A password wouldnt be set in this process and as the password grant requires a username and password to get the access token my problem becomes apparent.p  pSo, what would be good practice for this use case Should I create a password for the user or maybe send the facebook token as a valid password credential that is validated in the api Or maybe a different grant type is better suitedp  pAppreciate any feedbackp  pThanksp

Sometimes the user has to spend time abbreviating their notes to make it fit on the page.  I was thinking I could allow them to change the fontsize and save that info.  Then they can recreate the PDF and see if it fits.  I can see where a global fontsize might be a little tricky.  I need some type of dialog box to allow the user to make a global font selection. p

Negative 27365 pIve been trying to get YUICompress to work with our Maven build process, and so far I havent had any luck. I see YUICompress actually compress the files, and if I force a stop in the build I see that the files are correctly compressed, but then right at the end where it goes to build the war file, it looks like it copies over all the original files that were uncompressed instead of using the ones that were compressed.p  pIt seems like I must be missing something obvious, but so far I havent found anything by googling, and no amount of fiddling around seems to be able to point my in the right direction.p  pHere is the maven build logp  precode[INFO]  mavencleanplugin2.4.1clean defaultclean  FooBar  [INFO] Deleting CsourceFooBartarget [INFO]  [INFO]  mavenresourcesplugin2.5resources defaultresources  FooBar  [debug] execute contextualize [INFO] Using UTF8 encoding to copy filtered resources.

Negative 27365 pImagine you have millions of records containing text with average 2000 words each, and also you have an other list with about 100000 items.p  pe.g In the keywords list you a have item like president Obama and in one of the text records you have some thing like this ..... president Obama ...., so i want to find this keyword in the text and replace it with some thing like this ..... president Obama .... to highlight the keyword in the text, the keywords list contains multinoun word like the example.p  pWhat is the fastest way to this in such a huge list with millions of text recordsp  pNotesp  ol lipNow I do this work in a greedy way, check word by word and match them, but it takes about 2 seconds for each text record, and I want some thing near zero time.pli lipAlso I know this is something like namedentityrecognition and I worked with many of the NER framework such as Gate and ..., but because I want this for a language which is not supported by the frameworks I want to to this manually.pli ol
Negative 27365 pHi I have a small doubt on UITABLEVIEW methods. For Tableview we have DATASORCE AND DELEGATE methods. Datasource and delegate both are protocols only right. Why we need two protocols instead of two protocols can we use one protocol where both delegate and datasorce methods are declared. p  pDatasource protocol having methods which help us for getting data and deciding the height of the cell.p  pDelegate protocol having methods which will concentrate on functionality of tableview.p  pPlease let me clear this. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 27365 pI have a strongrailsstrong application which manages different types of items and users who own them. Items of different types might have different emfeaturesem. There is a number of strongsinatrastrong services which have to access items strongreadonlystrong, every service one specific item type. p  pIs it a good idea to create separate tables  databases for every service and to keep them in sync with the rails DB In this case the main DB will hold all items. Its postgres, so hstore could be used for different features. On all updates a sync message will be sent using Redis pubsub or RabbitMQ messaging. Services will subscribe and update service specific tables.p  pThe system should be really reliable, scalable, and prepared for highload and new not yet known item categories. What do you think Does it make sense or are there better approaches for these requirements Thank you in advance, I really appreciate your helpp
Negative 27365 pI am new to this forum and a beginner in R, so sorry if my scriptquestion is written in a confusing way. I have weather data from approximately 130 different stations over a period of 3 years and I want to fill the gaps. Right now, I only do so for global radiation, but I have got four more variables.  My table looks like thisp  precodetbl lt read.tabletext       Date.and.Time I glbRad I precipitation.mm.day I rel.hum...

If the gap lasts longer than for two hours, I use the values of the nearest weather station that has complete data for the needed time period. I have got a table distanzen.csv that contains the namei of the weather station in its first column and namej of neighbouring weather stations. The neighbouring stations are ordered by distance.p  precodeneighbors lt read.tableheader  TRUE, sep  I,stringsAsFactors  FALSE,text   namej I namei I distance 1 I Ainersthofen I Edelshausen I 16.303 2 I Ainersthofen I Gablingen I 19.684 codepre  pIn general, the script works. But it is far too slow. Do you have an idea how I could speed it up I know I should somehow get rid of the loops, but I dont quite know how to do so. Also, if the date in the neighbouring station is completely missing the entire row is missing, I get the  error  argument is of length zero.

Negative 27365 pIm working on a frameworklike structure that uses curl.js as script loader. Modules can be located in either the App or Core directory, which allows me to override Core modules easily from the app. I had a serverside script to search these directories and return the first found file but then I decided that the clientside should be able to work without any help from backend, so now I have a function that tries listed directories until one of them has a file.p  pAfter a while I realized that I dont have any way to differentiate between 404 errors and syntax errors. I want the loader to fail if there is an actual error in code but in case of 404 it should just look for the next file and finally fail if no file can be found.p  pSo, is it possible to detect if a script failedin curl.js, AMD or generally in js due to 404 and not because of errors in the loaded codep

Negative 27365 pI have explore almost anything but couldnt find anything convincing which can verify that why animation jerks if try to animate any window through its codeanimatecode property.p  pAnd this jerk occurs only on android part, in IOS it works perfectly even in lower devices. But why does it jerk in android Your inputs are welcome on this.p  pWhat Ive found so far is that, it might happen because of strongheavyweightstrong and stronglightweightstrong window concept but as in strongTitanium 3.2.0strong there is only strongheavyweightstrong window and still it jerks.p  pEven if we adjust our animation time but still animation is not smooth and as we increase the time animation will jerks more. But decreasing animation time is not a solution as in this case animation is jerking but apparently not caught. So please give your inputs on this for future correspondence.p  pThank Youp

Negative 27365 pIn a WPF application I am working on, I have icons on a map that show a context menu in a Popup when clicked.  Since I want to align the context menu below the icon, I use codePlacementRectanglecode with the rectangle of the icon image and codePlacement.Bottomcode.  p  pThis works fine most of the time, but a few of the icons have context menus that are more than half the height of the screen on a 1024x768 screen, and when close to the edge of the screen the Popups are getting clipped after being aligned to the edge.p  pI have read the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb61359628vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowdocsa on this several times over, but dont see an explanation for the behavior I am seeing. Specifically, the behavior I am seeing isp  pWhen the icon is near center of the screen, but too low for the menu to fit below it, the Popup gets flipped to the top of the icon as expected Target Origin amp Popup Alignment Point change.  When the resulting flip puts the top of the popup past the top edge of the screen, the top of the popup is realigned with the screen as expected.  The bottom edge of the Popup, however, does not get shifted downwards with the rest of the Popup, resulting in clipping the bottom content of the Popup while there is plenty of room to expand.  This seems to counter the reason it gets shifted to the edge of the screen in the first place for security concerns....p  pFrom the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb61359628vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowdocsa I would expect all of this behavior to be the same except for the clipping at the end, and If I use codePlacement.Mousecode or codePlacement.MousePointcode, the whole Popup shifts correctly.p  pI can find no explanation for this behavior in the msdn docs or from google searches, is this a bug or expected behavior  Is there a workaround or trick for using PlacementRectangle and preventing the resulting clippingp  pI created a simple WPF example app to demonstrate the problem.

Negative 27365 pIts hard to put this into words, but Ill do my best.p  pstrongHigh Levelstrong I am writing a web service to add a new codePrblFldrcode entity to the database, but I need to associate the proper codePrblTmpltcode with it please ignore the terrible naming scheme, I didnt do it. I am POSTing JSON, which Jersey maps to the correct POJOs. But, instead of calling the POJOs constructor for one of the fields, I want it to use the codeEntityManagercode to find the correct object based on an ID.p  pstrongLow Levelstrong Heres a sample of the JSON I am currently trying to pass to my web servicep  precode     fldrNm test,     prblTmplt          tmpltSeqId 4       codepre  pHeres the code on the other side, where the web service sitsp  precodePOST ConsumesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON Pathfolderscreate public Response createFolderPrblFldr folder      em.persistfolder     return Response.okgson.toJsonfolder, MediaType.APPLICATIONJSON.build  codepre  pNow, heres what the codePrblFldrcode entity looks like, with a lot of irrelevant fields omittedp  precodeEntity TablenamePRBLFLDR NamedQuerynamePrblFldr.findAll, querySELECT p FROM PrblFldr p public class PrblFldr implements Serializable       Expose     ColumnnameFLDRNM     private String fldrNm      bidirectional manytoone association to PrblTmplt     Expose     ManyToOne     JoinColumnnameFLDRTYPSEQID, insertablefalse, updatablefalse     private PrblTmplt prblTmplt       other fields...  codepre  pSee how that codeprblTmpltcode field is joined on codeFLDRTYPSEQIDcode I need to get from that ID to the object.

Im not sure if what Im talking about is possible, but after searching for hours, I figured I would ask you guys.p  pstrongEDITstrong To more clearly specify my situation, the above code when I log what the web service sends back outputs JSON like thisp  precode     fldrNm test,     prblTmplt          tmpltSeqId 4       codepre  p... which is exactly what I put in. Instead, I want that codetmpltSeqIdcode to be used as a lookup PK to fetch the object that exists with that ID in the DB, so a return might look something like thisp  precode     fldrNm test,     prblTmplt          tmpltSeqId 4,         tmpltDesc sample description,         tmpltNm sample template name,          etc...       codepre

By the way, the code below is being done in a separate thread and I am passing in my context to the thread in order to create the Socket.p  precode        using ZmqSocket server  cntxt.CreateSocketZeroMQ.SocketType.ROUTER                      string strSocketAddress  String.Formattcp01, strIPAddress, nPort.ToString              try                              server.Linger  TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds1                   server.BindstrSocketAddress                  server.ReceiveReady  serverReceiveReady                  ZeroMQ.Poller poller  new Pollernew ListltZmqSocketgt server                  while true                                      poller.Poll                                            catch ZmqException zex                              server.DisconnectstrSocketAddress                  server.Close                  server.Dispose                       codepre  pEverything here works as expected and I do receive the event whenever I receive data on the socket. But when I want to shutdown the app, I cant figure out how I am suppose to break out of the loop. I do understand that I can put a timeout on the poll and put some sort of flag in to say that Im shutting down but I was hoping there would be a better solution than that.p  pWhat happens now is that when I am wanting to shut down, I call Terminate on the context but at that point the application hangs and never returns. I am assuming it is hanging because I still have a socket open. I also read that by setting the Linger flag to something really small that the socket should shutdown after the call to Terminate on the context but that isnt happening.p  pThe reason I have the catch clause in is because when I was using version 2.0 and I called Dispose on the context, I would receive an exception and I could gracefully get rid of the socket, but Im no longer getting an exception with version 3.0.p  pSo I was wondering if Im just missing something And if there is a more elegant approach to shutting down a socket that is in its own thread waiting for messagesp

Negative 27365 pIm experimenting with java flavored zmq to test the benefits of using PGM over TCP in my project.  So I changed the weather example, from the zmq guide, to use the epgm transport. Everything compiles and runs, but nothing is being sent or received.  If I change the transport back to TCP, the server receives the messages sent from the client and I get the console output Im expecting.p  pSo, what are the requirements for using PGM  I changed the string, that Im passing to the bind and connect methods, to follow the zmq api for zmqpgm transportinterfacemulticast addressport.  That didnt work.  I get and invalid argument error whenever I attempt to use this format.  So, I simplified it by dropping the interface and semicolon which works, but Im not getting any results.p  pI havent been able to find a jzmq example that uses pgmepgm and the api documentation for the java binding does not define the appropriate string format for an endpoint passed to bind or connect.  So what am I missing here  Do I have to use different hosts for the client and the serverp  pOne thing of note is that Im running my code on a VirtualBox VM Ubuntu 14.04OSX Mavericks host.

Negative 27365 pHi I am writing a PHP function to communicate with an external WSDL service and am currently experiencing an issue.

Negative 27365 pIs there a way to have log4net change the target location of the intended log thru certain conditions in the program, without having to update and redeploy the xml configp  pI dont want any configuration dependent solution. It should work purely thru code. I have certain conditions based on which I will be able to tell my program which target to choose. On some condition the program will automatically switch between a text file on a predefined path or to SQL Server on a predefined serverdatabase or to an event log under my application suites name. File path, sql connection string and event log parameters will be the only thing stored in my applications config file.p  pIs this even doable on log4net I couldnt find anything relevant with what I searched so I dont have any code I can show yet. Most answers were on how to change the default directory location, but thats not what I want.p  pThanksp

Conventionally, all  specs live under a spec directory, which RSpec adds to the LOADPATH.  The generated .rspec file contains require spechelper which will cause this  file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any files.   Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as  lightweight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file  will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an  individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making  a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs  the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need it.   The .rspec file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that  users commonly want.   See httprubydoc.infogemsrspeccoreRSpecCoreConfiguration RSpec.configure do config    rspecexpectations config goes here. You can use an alternate    assertionexpectation library such as wrong or the stdlibminitest    assertions if you prefer.   config.expectwith rspec do expectations      This option will default to true in RSpec 4. It makes the description      and failuremessage of custom matchers include text for helper methods      defined using chain, e.g.      bebiggerthan2.andsmallerthan4.description         gt be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4      ...rather than         gt be bigger than 2     expectations.includechainclausesincustommatcherdescriptions  true   end     rspecmocks config goes here. You can use an alternate test double    library such as bogus or mocha by changing the mockwith option here.   config.mockwith rspec do mocks      Prevents you from mocking or stubbing a method that does not exist on      a real object. This is generally recommended, and will default to      true in RSpec 4.     mocks.verifypartialdoubles  true   end     These two settings work together to allow you to limit a spec run    to individual examples or groups you care about by tagging them with    focus metadata.

Negative 27365 pIm developing a website where Im using REDIS to store the list of user. Its in a sorted set where the score is simply the time when they were put into the list. Paginating through this list is very easy. The problematic part comes, when I want to show from this list only the online users with paginations if necessary. I have for every minute a SET where I store only userIDs, the ones whom was online. p  pThe problem, I cant intersect SET with SORTED SET. So what I was thinking, is to transform the online users set to a sorted set without score and use INTERSECT at the time of the request, if someone come online in the same minute, thats not a problem, they will be shown in the next minute, and I simply use a ZINTERSTORY command.p  pDoes someone have a better ideap

However, it is not a valid jsoptions value.p  pI tried to modify the Javascript file selectadvanced.js and even selectadvanced.php just to see if I could make it work based on Select 2 documentation, but it doesnt seem to work even if there are no errors. Select2 says that the field should be hidden instead of a select but I cant seem to modify the code to make it work.p  pI dont want to use a plugin because it will not work in synergy with my current meta boxes.p  pDid anyone find a solution or had to work around this Or maybe you have another solution to propose me with sortable post content.

Negative 27365 pI know with an codeEntrycode widget, in Tkinter, you can do thisp  precodeEntry.configshow codepre  pand it will show asterisks instead of whatever you type.p  pHowever, I would like to do the same thing with a codeTextcode widget, but there is no codeshowcode option to configure for codeTextcode widgets. Is there any way to do this in a codeTextcode widget Itll mean a lot less work for me if there is.p  pThe reason it will be less work is because I have lots of custom functionality and customizations set up for my codeTextcode widget class, and I dont want to have to reprogram it all over again for an codeEntrycode widget, when a oneline Text widget works just fine in its place other than maybe this feature. codeTextcode and codeEntrycode widgets have different ways to access indexes and such, and these are quite involved. My customizations make it so you can do such as press codectrlleftcode to skip back a word, and all kinds of stuff like that and complicated stuff not like that, too, which may or may not have to do with indexes.p

Negative 27365 pDoing a basic windowed program using Swing and a SQL database, and still being a rookie, Im having trouble finding a way to display updated content from my database in my different ComboBoxesListsTextFields the moment modifications are done by the user from the same window.p  pMy database has two tables among others, one named SERIES and the other named CLASS, and my GUI has a JPanel where you can add new series by simply entering its name and code in two different JTextFields and then confirm by clicking on a Create JButton.p  pSo Id like the different containers in other JPanels to update their content right after the action has been confirmed by button click provided that it goes through the different tests of course.p  pHeres my base code I dont paste the generated

pstrongEDITstrong I came up with something that perhaps could work but I would need some help with it still. Ive created a method called public void Refresh that has the same content than my GUI constructor, so that I can call it in the methods I want to handle the refresh because I obviously couldnt call the constructor itself in them since they are called by it in the first place. Heres the code Ive added in my JButtons methodsp  precodetry      GUI refresh  new GUI     refresh.Refresh     this.revalidate     this.repaint  catch ClassNotFoundException e      Logger.getLoggerGUI.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, e  codepre  pYou can see that Ive tried calling the current object instantiated in the window with this. but obviously thats not doing what I wished for and the code is overall clunky... The point is to create a fresh object that constructs the same thing as the former and to instantiate it in the current window so that it recreates its content with content up to date. I perhaps made a mistake by calling my method with void also, thats something I dont understand well yet. So I dont know if that makes sense but thats the last thing I can come up with by myself I guess...p

Negative 27365 pIm trying to filter out line noise60Hz and 120Hz from a EEG signals received over a bluetooth link. Im proposing to use a IIR notch filter to filter out the linenoise which varies w.r.t to distance between the bluetooth transmitter and receiver.

The problem is Qfactor and stopband Bandwidth which define the notch filter dont directly relate to the stop band attenuation. If this is not possible is there any other equally efficient adaptive stopband filtering method to achieve the same  How can this be implemented w.r.t line noise measurement and corresponding filter parameter adjustments      p

This is because at times of pressure on the national electricity grid, there are schedules for which areas will be off when, and this info can be displayed on a map for easy use.p  pA finished version of this tool is already live here, using boundary data I was provided in KML format by the City of Cape Town  a hrefhttpewn.co.zaassetsloadsheddingcapetown.html relnofollowhttpewn.co.zaassetsloadsheddingcapetown.htmlap  pI now need to do the same for other cities, starting with Johannesburg. Unfortuantely I have as yet been unable to obtain the KML or SHP data I need thus far I can convert the SHP data to KML.p  pSo, while looking at several options, I noticed that if you perform the correct search, google maps will outline a suburb for you. e.g. a hrefhttpswww.google.co.zamapsplaceRiverclub,Sandton26.079238,28.040455,15zdata3m14b14m23m11s0x1e957372d9f64a170x2c4d986e4ee58796 relnofollowhttpswww.google.co.zamapsplaceRiverclub,Sandton26.079238,28.040455,15zdata3m14b14m23m11s0x1e957372d9f64a170x2c4d986e4ee58796ap  pYou can also do a search via the places API for an address via either the webservices REST API or the javascript API, and obtain a location, containing its heirarchy. One of the levels in the heirarchy is the suburb, but again, I have not been able to obtain the boundary data  all Ive been able to get is placeID and a centre point.p  pSo it surely must be possible to somehow obtain that boundary data, as a sequence of latlng coordinates As of yet, Ive had no luck with either the javascript API or the webservices REST API.p  pAny assistence would be greatly appreciated. I dont really care where I get the data from at this stage, so if anyone can suggest any alternative ways to get what I need, Im open to any viable alternative.p

Negative 27365 pIm trying to crack a particular web CAPTCHA. Im planning to do it by segmenting the characters and passing them to an ANN mostly for features, I will be using method of moments as it seems difficult to completely remove noise completelyp  pThe captcha is very noisy, and unfortunately there is no color difference between the noise and the actual text, so separation based on color will not work. After quite some thought, I managed to implement a floodfill style algorithm on the pixels of the captcha to separate small disconnected components, and after this I ended up with something like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgejnw.png altCAPTCHA after considerable noise removalp  pMost of the noise is gone but some of it is left around the letters themselves since it is touching the text.  Im not an expert on image filters, and Im finding it very difficult to find the right filter to reduce the remaining noise and enhance the characters. Any Ideas on what filters I could use for this purpose.p  pNote Im not using any image manipulation toollibrary for this. Im writing raw pixel manipulation code, but I can implement most filters given their convolution kernelp  pThe problem is that due to this noise, it is becoming difficult to segment the characters. Clearly trying to find vertical lines with no dark pixels is not going to work, since there is noise and some of the letters are touching. Any ideas on how I could segment these efficiently p  pEDIT Original image img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJODPt.png altoriginal image of captchap

Negative 27365 pI am having trouble with validation for integers in a WPF window.  My business object has an codeAgeintcode property.  I want to validate that codeAge gt 5code.  I see how to do this with codeIDataErrorInfocode and setting codeValidatesOnDataErrorscode to true.  That works if I enter in a number.  But if I enter an empty string or codeabccode, the validation code isnt getting called.  This is a problem because I have a button that I want to be enabled only if the validation code succeeds.p  pAccording to my Output Window, the problem is that the default converter is throwing a codeFormatExceptioncode in the codeConvertBackcode method.  This prevents the code from calling the codeIDataErrorInfo.this[string columnName]code method.  Im currently using the default codeintcode converterp  pIve read about a couple of solutions to this, but they either dont work, or seem hackyp  ol liemUse a Nullableltintgtem.  This doesnt prevent the exception.li liemUse a string instead of an intem.  This would work, but it doesnt allow me to take advantage of builtin WPF features.  It feels like a hack.li liemI thought I might be able to use my own codeIValueConvertercodeem to intercept the ConvertBack call, but I need to give the converter access to the my business object so that it can set some kind of codeIsValidboolcode property.

My Question is How I add click even on dynamic list view and pass that unique Hotel Id so that later I am able to fetch more information from server using that Hotel Id. strongBut these dynamic list is not working hotel id is not passing detailsPage.livepageshow, functionvaluestrong. p  pa hrefhttpcoenraets.orgblog201110sampleapplicationwithjquerymobileandphonegap relnofollowI use this as reference to make clickable dynamic list and fetch the the more info from the database ap  pstrongMy server side code isstrong p  precodeltphp headerAccessControlAllowOrigin Should work in Cross Domaim ajax Calling request mysqlconnectlocalhost,root,1234 mysqlselectdbhotels ifissetGET[type]      ifGET[type]login         distanceInKMGET[Distance]                querySelect  from buddy where DistanceltdistanceInKM         resultmysqlqueryquery         totalRowsmysqlnumrowsresult          iftotalRowsgt0             recipesarray             whilerecipemysqlfetcharrayresult, MYSQLASSOC                 recipes[]arrayHotelgtrecipe                          outputjsonencoderecipes             echo output                else     echo Invalid format  codepre  pstrongjavaScript code which is not workingstrongp  precodeltscriptgt              document.readyfunction                  btnReg.clickfunction                      listOfFoodOptions.empty                     var distance  document.getElementByIddistanceid.value                      var output                      var hiddenId                     .ajax                              urlhttp192.168.1.4ExperiementswebservicesgetBuddy.php,                              typeGET,                              dataTypejson,                              datatypelogin, Distancedistance,                              ContentTypeapplicationjson,                              success functionresponse                              console.logresponse                                  .eachresponse, functionindex,value                                          listOfHotels.appendltligtlta hrefdetailsPageidvalue.Chef.Idgtvalue.Chef.Name ltagtltligt                                                                                                listOfHotels.listviewrefresh                                                                       ,                              error functionerr                              alertJSON.stringifyerr                                                 ajax                   click               ready             detailsPage.livepageshow,functioneven                  var idgetUrlVar[id]                  .getJSONhttp192.168.1.4ExperiementswebservicesgetBuddy.phpidid, displayChef                          function displayHotelvalue                 var data.Hotel                 fullName.textvar.Name                 Item.textvar.Item                 followers.textvar.Followers                 actionList.listviewrefresh                           function getUrlVars                  var vars  [], hash                 var hashes  window.location.href.slicewindow.location.href.indexOf  1.splitamp                 forvar i  0 i lt hashes.length i                                      hash  hashes[i].split                     vars.pushhash[0]                     vars[hash[0]]  hash[1]                                  return vars                         ltscriptgt codepre  pstrongDetail Page which will have more details informationstrongp  precodeltdiv datarolepage iddetailsPage  dataaddbackbtntruegt         ltdiv dataroleheadergt             lth1gtHotel Detailslth1gt         ltdivgt         ltdiv datarolecontentgt              ltimg idhotelPicgt             ltdiv idhotelDetailsgt                 lth3 idfullNamegtlth3gt                 ltp idItemgtltpgt                 ltp idfollowersgtltpgt             ltdivgt                    ltul idactionList datarolelistview datainsettruegtltulgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre
Negative 27365 pIs there any way to set no label for specifics values p  pI explain  I have a GraphView for which Y values cannot be higher than 3. And I only want verticals labels for the values 1, 2 and 3.p  pI tried to use the following method p  precodemyGraph.getGraphViewStyle.setNumVerticalLabels3 codepre  pBut this one puts my labels for the Y values 0,1.5 and 3. This is not what I want.p  pThen I tried to set a custom label formatter. But the thing is I did not succeed in putting no values for the other labels.p  pHere is my current code p  precodemyGraph.setCustomLabelFormatternew CustomLabelFormatter      Override     public String formatLabeldouble value, boolean isValueX          ifisValueX               String res  null              ifvalue  1.0                  res  getStringR.string.mylabel1              else ifvalue  2.0                  res  getStringR.string.mylabel2              else ifvalue  3.0                  res  getStringR.string.mylabel3                           return res                   return null       codepre  pSo I return null when I dont want to display the value but the library makes that when we return null, it puts the double value of the label. I tried to return an empty string or a string with blank spaces but it makes my app crashes.p  pHave you any idea about a way to do what I want p  pIt would be great p  pThanks in advance p

I expected that. But what is this 4096 bytes in 1 CRT Blocks According to microsoftp  pA CRT block is allocated by the CRT library for its own use. The CRT library handles the deallocation for these blocks. Therefore, it is unlikely you will see these in the memory leak report unless something is significantly wrong, for example, the CRT library is corrupted.p  pShould I just ignore this 4096 bytes Thanks.p
Negative 27365 pI have been toying around with a piece of code I cant get right. And have had some strange stuff with. The idea is to get a webserver run on a WiFi capable PIC to display a page. On the page is measurements and timedate all values will be from the PIC but for now i have these values in the HTMLjavascript code as I design the page with Notepadp  pI have the page roughly how I want it to look. The functionality works 9 out of 10. As you will see the button Refresh All Measurements Time Date when pressed should cycle through values. When the PIC will run this button will call to the PIC to get new values and the page will be updated by the getElementById as is already in the cycle functionp  pThe other two buttons make sure the reset values have all been filled out before clicking the Reset Values button. These two buttons do what they should for now. Again when the PIC is running this the Reset Values button will send a string to the PIC to reset those values I have yet to code that here The question I have is why the Refresh All cycle code will not work. In other projectscode I can get this to work, but not here. So any help in whats stopping it would be great.p  pAnd the other questions I have is to do with the functions in javascript. I would like to move them all up into the header section. But if i do none of the buttons will do anything, so i leave the code close to where its doing things. Whats up with thatp  pCheers Chrisp  pHeres the code as it is nowp  precodeltHTMLgt ltHEADgt     ltTITLEgt         Build 2 WD Rebuild     ltTITLEgt     ltSTYLEgt         BODY backgroundcolorOrange

Negative 27365 pIm new to Python, and Im trying to plot some coordinate data. As such, Id like the two axes to be on the same scale.p  pIm trying to plot the data like thisp  precodexyPanel  plt.subplot2grid4,2,0,0 plt.xlabelx plt.ylabely plt.plot[0,0],[100,100]  xyPanel.setxlim[8,8] xyPanel.setaspectequal codepre  pWhat I would expect to happen is for Python to create the panel in the appropriate position on the page, and then set the xaxis to the desired limits, and then automatically scale emjust the yaxisem such that it is the same scale as the xaxis.p  pWhat actually happens is that the yaxis is rescaled to fit all the data that has been plotted in this example, rescaled to limits 100, and then the plot window is changed such that the xaxis can be 8 and yield an equal aspect ratio. If codesetaspectequal datalimcode is used, then both axes are redrawn such that the yaxis limit is 100 and the xaxis has whatever limits are necessary for an equal aspect ratio given the original plot window.p  pWhats really infuriating is that, if one sets the y limits manually, and then uses codesetaspectequalcode, Python behaves exactly as Id hope by simply scaling x to match y and leaving the plot window alone its just when you want to specify x and scale y that the problem arises.p  precodexyPanel  plt.subplot2grid4,2,0,0 plt.xlabelx plt.ylabely plt.plot[100,100],[0,0]  xyPanel.setylim[8,8] xyPanel.setaspectequal codepre  pIs there a way to have the top example behave as Ive outlined, by automatically rescaling the y axis rather than redrawing the plot windowp

Negative 27365 pI have a form in my application that is used for previewing a report.  It has a C1Ribbon at the top which contains navigation buttons, and a C1PrintPreview displaying in a PreviewPane. I want the navigation buttons in the ribbon first, previous, next, last, as well as a text box in which to enter a specific page number, to navigate through the preview of the report accordingly.  So far, all the documentation and samples Ive found have dealt only with adding hyperlinks directly to the report itself...so Im having a hard time adapting it to my use. Below is what I have so far...I dont get any build or runtime errors, it just doesnt do anything.p  precodePrivate Sub btnNextClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles btnNext.Click     Dim nextPage As C1LinkTargetPage  New C1LinkTargetPagePageJumpTypeEnum.Next End Sub  Private Sub btnLastClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles btnLast.Click     Dim lastPage As C1LinkTargetPage  New C1LinkTargetPagePageJumpTypeEnum.Last End Sub  Private Sub btnPreviousClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles btnPrevious.Click     Dim prevPage As C1LinkTargetPage  New C1LinkTargetPagePageJumpTypeEnum.Previous End Sub  Private Sub btnFirstClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles btnFirst.Click     Dim firstPage As C1LinkTargetPage  New C1LinkTargetPagePageJumpTypeEnum.First End Sub  Private Sub NavigationKeyDownsender As Object, e As KeyEventArgs Handles txtPageNum.KeyDown     If e.Modifiers  Keys.Enter Then         Dim setPage As C1LinkTargetPage  New C1LinkTargetPagePageJumpTypeEnum.Absolute         setPage.

But Im not sure how to go about doing that  its not like theres a jumptopage method for the C1PrintPreview wish it were that easy. Buttons in the ribbon dont have a hyperlink property, so I cant set that when the form loads as in all the samples I found.  Not sure where to go from here... Also I dont even know how Im supposed to be able to use the Absolute PageJumpTypeEnum...PageNo is read only.p  pThank youp  pUPDATE 225p  pI learned that I should be dealing with properties of the Preview Pane...not the C1PrintDocument.  With the code below, the navigation buttons and specifying a page number work.  My only problem now then is displaying the current page in that page number box.

Negative 27365 pI have a device with FPGA which sends data via simple UART. The data is a packet of 32 bytes, baudrate is 115200.

Negative 27365 pI tried to make this as simple as possible with a short example.p  pWe have two databases, one in MSSQLServer and other in Progress. We have the user DTO as it follows that we shown in a UI table within a web application.p  precodeUser  int, id String, name String, accountNumber String, street String, city String, country codepre  pNow this DTOEntity is not stored only in one database, some information fields for the same user are stored in one database and some in the other database.p  precodeMSsql  Table user int, id String, name String, accountNumber   Table userModel int, id String, street String, city String, country codepre  pAs you can see the key is the only piece that link two tables in both databases, as I said before they are not in the same database and not using same database vendor.p  pWe have a requirement for sorting the UI table for each column. Obviously we need to create user dto with the information coming from both databases.p  pOur proposal at this moment is if user want to apply sorting using street field, we run a query in the Progress database and obtain a page using pagination using this resultset and go directly to the MSSQLServer User table with those keys and run another query to extract the missing information and save it to our DTO and transfer it to the UI. With implies run a query in one database then other query based on the returned keys in the second database.p  pThe order of the database could change depending in which columnfield the user wants to apply sorting.p  pTechnically we will create a jparepository that acts as a facade and depending on the field make the process in the correct database.p  pMy question is There is some kind of pattern that is commonly used in this scenarios, we are using spring, so probably spring have some out of the box features to support this requirement, will be great if this is possible using jparepositories I have several doubts about it as we will use two different entitymanagers, one for each database. p  pNote Move data from one database to another is not an option.p

Ideally, Id like to be able to include the classes automatically using gradle, but it doesnt seem like thats possible if its not at least supporting Maven.

Negative 27365 pIm trying to use BootstrapSwitch to toggle my checkboxes.  It works fine on a normal page, or a modal thats preloaded into the page.p  pHowever, if I load the modal from a remote page a hrefsomething.html the toggle does not workdisplay.  Apparently it loads once but doesnt reload after the modal is opened.p  pI tried p  precodemyModal.onshown.bs.modal,function       .checkbox.bootstrapSwitch   codepre  pBut to no avail.p  pIve tried added the JS code directly to the code being pulled from the Modal as well but it didnt work.

Negative 27365 pI am in the process of migrating my handcoded database code under Android to an ORMbased environment. I think they are now mature enough to provide different alternatives for my work. Taking into consideration that I have not chosen one yet, I wanted to ask if there exists something that allows to convert a SQLITE eschema into the corresponding Java classes whether annotated or not, although a readytouse annotated class would be much better. My database is quite simple, without complex types or relationships, being the most complex a many to many table. p  pAny hints on this or how to perform it in a productive manner.p  pEDIT I have make a thorough search on the Internet for something like this and stackoverflow is the last resort I have considered.

Negative 27365 pHello im new to django and im developing a software for stores, each store from a store chain has their own clients and payments. So there will be a role for a employee of an specific store that do not need to know about others stores, and there will be a role for the administrator of the stores who is not the admin of the system, is just another high level employee role that needs to know about the payments of every store.p  pthe model looks like thisp  precodeclass Storemodels.Model id  models.IntegerFieldmaxlength10, primarykeyTrue, default0 name  models.CharFieldmaxlength20  def unicodeself     return self.name  class Clientsmodels.Model store  models.ForeignKeyStore  id  models.IntegerFieldmaxlength10, primarykeyTrue, default0 name  models.CharFieldmaxlength20 lastname  models.CharFieldmaxlength20  def unicodeself     return self.lastname  class Paymentsmodels.Model client  models.ForeignKeyClients   monthfrom  models.DateFielddefault11110101 amount  models.IntegerFielddefault0  def unicodeself     return self.monthfrom.strftimeYmd codepre  pthis is the client viewp  precodeloginrequiredloginurl  def clientsrequest querystring   foundentries  None  if q in request.GET and request.GET[q].strip     querystring  request.GET[q]      entryquery  getqueryquerystring, [id, name,]     print entryquery     foundentries  Clients.objects.filterentryquery.orderbyid     print foundentries else     foundentries  Clients.objects.all  return rendertoresponseclients.html,  querystring querystring, foundentries foundentries , contextinstanceRequestContextrequest codepre  pand in the html i display the list of clients like thisp  precode if foundentries        for Clients in foundentries            Clients.name   Clients.lastname        endfor   endif  codepre  pfor example an employee form store 1 do not need to know about clients of store 3, but needs to know about clients from store 1.

Negative 27365 pThis is a highvolume production system, however, this particular code path is seldom used.  Its an import feature that can potential result in a lot data coming in, but its only occasionally used, a few times a month, perhaps.p  pHaving a polite debate with a colleague.  The issue is whether a simple thread created the old fashioned wayp  precodeRunnable thread  new Runnable    public void run      ... do the import work ...     new Threadthread.start codepre  pIs sufficient, or if this requires using a thread pool.p  pThis is happening in a servicelayer class that is called from a servlet providing a RESTful interface.

The problem is Quickbooks imports the invoices from the other system but will not import the invoice number instead assigning its own invoice number and causing accounting personnel to have to go back into QB and change the invoice number manually for upwards of 100 invoices a day. p  pQuestion is whether there is a way to write a script  which can force QB to import the original invoice number and not override it, or to possibly just write a script to read the invoice fields, put them in a table or csv and then import that into QB  Any input on how to best tackle this would be appreciated. p

Negative 27365 pIm trying to compile an existing c project, originally developed on linux with gcc. The only external library is GSL GNU Scientific Library. I have created an external build tool project to use xcodes debugger, but I currently have two issues.p  p1 When I try to build in xcode it fails with the error codegslgslmatrix.h file not foundcode. I have added codeusrlocalincludecode to the codeHEADERSEARCHPATHScode and confirmed that there is a codegslcode folder in that location, which contains all of the header files installed with brew. However, if I type codemakecode in the CL then the project compiles without any errors, so I know there isnt an issue with my GSL, the makefile or the switch from gcc to clang.p  pIve looked at a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions30331302xcode632unabletobuildorrunprojectsXcode 6.3.2 unable to build or run projectsa, and updated my xcode CL tools just in base, but I was already on the latest 2339.p  p2 While it would be nice to build from within xcode, its not the end of the world if I have to build from the CL everytime.

Ive also looked through a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions64790whyarentmybreakpointsworkingWhy aren39t my breakpoints workinga and havent found anything that works. p  pI thought it might be operator error since Im running the target with ProductRun, but I dont see any option to specifically start debug mode like intellij. Im also able to pause the code and the debugger view comes up, but when I pause it just shows me the assembly instructions.p

Negative 27365 pI am using Armadillo 5.200 with Visual Studio 2013 to solve a system of linear equations xAb.  My code calculates this by solving xAb, and I am using Armadillos solve function to solve the system of linear equations. p  pMy problem is that the solution returned to me is incorrect it is different from both the Eigen and Matlab solutions to the same problem, which match up.  The reason Im not just using Eigen in the first place is that it performs too slowly I have to make the calculation several million times and I want to see if using Armadillo speeds it up at all.

Negative 27365 pI currently work on a Java based web application. Recently we created some REST endpoints using Spring. The reason for this was because we developed a hybrid mobile app that integrates with our main application via these end points.p  pThe problem is that going forward we are not quite sure how to handle updates. If we update our API, e.g. we change the method signatures of the end point methods or we change the attributes on the DTOs that we return as JSON, then we would have an issue if our mobile users are running an out dated version of the mobile app.p  pWhat we want to implement is something that will force our users to update the app if it is out of date. I have seen a lot of mobile apps that do this. So we thought of having an API version for our REST API and then have the mobile app check if the version it is using is the same as the version being run by our server and if not, then force the user to do an update.p  pThe problems we have arep  ol lipWe only have one version of our server running at any time. So how would we time our releases What happens in the event that we release a new version of our API and our mobile app but the app store does not yet have the latest version publicly available. Then the user will be forced to do an update but the updated app is not yet available to them.pli lipHow do we maintain the API version number On the mobile app we can just configure that. But on the server it is not great to have to maintain a version number. The reason I say this is what if we make a change to a method signature or DTO, etc, and forget to update this version number manually before releasing Surely there is a more automatic way to do this where some unique API key is generated based on the current definition of the API We could then use this instead of an API version number.pli ol
