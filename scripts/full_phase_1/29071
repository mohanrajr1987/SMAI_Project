I took a look in react developers tool and saw that cars is not defined as an Array.p  pIs this maybe because codechoosenDrivercode is a codestatecode and arrays are not supported in this mannerp  pThe cars obviously exists but not as an Array. p  pAny ideas on how to access cars as an Array in this examplep  pThank youp  pUpdatep  pWhen looking at this.context.foo.cars in reactTools i see thisp  precodecars  gtproto ..  0 4242594395935934,  1 3543435095340509 etc...  cars should be an Array so I would expect to see cars Array[4] codepre  pAllthough in the DB everythingg looks as it shouldp  precodecars[5607b0747eb3eefc225aed61,5607b07a7eb3eefc225aed62,5606bf4b0e76916c1d1668b4,5607b07a7eb3eefc225aed62]] codepre  pLast Update Here they are next to eachother i react Tools I have a list of drivers and this shows that the Driverobject Changes when it gets selectedp  precodeState choosenDriver ..  v0  id 235345353453  name Roger  cars      gtproto ..      0 4242594395935934,     id undefined    Same driver but not choosen drivers array[3]  gt0   gt1        v 0       id 4242594395935934       cars Array[1] codepre  pSo something happens to the Array when it gets selected.

Negative 29071 pIve been looking for ways to improve the overall attractiveness of my iPhone applications. A majority of the functionality happens in UITableView. I think I can start by adding subtle gradients to UITableViewCells, as that seems to improve the feel of the app by an order of magnitude. Selecting the appropriate fontssizes helps a great deal also. My question for this forum is, whats the best strategy of adding gradients to UITableViewCells Are you using Core GraphicsQuartz Are you using a 1x1 pixel image and stretching it Im interesting in something along the lines of the following screenshot of the Tumblr iPhone app a hrefhttpdlclient.getdropbox.comu57676screenshotstumblr.jpghttpdlclient.getdropbox.comu57676screenshotstumblr.jpgap  pDoes anyone have any good examples of how to make your UITableViewCells stick outp  pAnd for performance reasons is it better to use an image or draw with Quartz If Quartz, Id love to see some sample codes of how folks are drawing the gradients into the cells.p  pThanks.p

Negative 29071 pIve got an UIScrollView with a grid of images. Currently theyre only 6, but there might be  a few hundred some day. So of course it would be a bad idea to create a few hundred UIImageView objects inside that UIScrollView and fill them all up with image data. I think I was reading this somewhere in the Apple docs They recommend to only create so mutch elemends as you need to fill up the scrollable visible area.p  pBut I fear performance issues if I would instantly reposition UIImageView elements. I think. As the user starts to scrolls down lets assume it starts at 0,0, Id have to reposition those UIView objects that go out of visible area at the top, positioning them quickly to the bottom and then assigning very  quickly an new image object to that UIImageViews in the row. I mean... what if the user starts scrolling like a wild gazelle, faster and fasterp  pHows your approach for doing thatp

Negative 29071 pWhat convention do you use to comment getters and setters  This is something Ive wondered for quite some time, for instancep  precode   1a what do you put here   param salary 1b what do you put here   public void setSalaryfloat salary     2a what do you put here   return 2b   public float getSalary codepre  pI always find Im pretty much writing the exact same thing for 1ab and 2ab, something like 1a Sets the salary of the employee, 1b the salary of the employee.  It just seems so redundant.  Now I could see for something more complex you might write more in the a parts, to give context, but for a majority of the getterssetters out there the wording is almost exactly the same.p  pIm just curious if, for the simple getterssetters its ok to only fill in either the a part OR the b part.p  pWhat do you thinkp

Negative 29071 pIm moving a website to Wordpress and simultaneously changing the convoluted URL structure they had on their old platform.

Negative 29071 pI am currently building a new version of webservice that my company already provides.  The current webservice has an input parameter of type string.

I was thinking that my service would look something like thisp  precode[WebMethod] public bool Uploadint referenceID, string referenceName, etc...      Do something  codepre  pThis issue that I am having is that in actuality there are a large amount of input parameters and some of them are complex types.  For example, the Upload Method needs to take in a complex object called an Allocation.  This object is actually made up of several integers, decimal values, strings, and other complex objects.  Should I build the webservice like sop  precode[WebMethod] public bool Uploadint referenceID, string referenceName, Allocation referenceAllocation      Do something  codepre  pOr is there a different way to do this  p  pNote this Allocation object has a hierarchy in the xsd that was provided for the old service. p  pCould it be that the original service only took in xml to combat this problem  Is there a better way to take in complex types to a webservicep  pNote This is a C 2.0 webservice.p

Negative 29071 pIn one of my previous questions about using dynamically built up strings where clauses and using them in LINQ, I was guided towards the LINQ Dynamic Query Library a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20080107dynamiclinqpart1usingthelinqdynamicquerylibrary.aspxDynamic LINQa.p  pThe first issue was that it only applies to IQueryable, this however can be overcome by using the .AsQueryable extension method on any IEnumerable.p  pThe problem I ran into was that Dynamic LINQ is looking for a Property called CustomerID or whatever was passed in to the string predicate for dynamic linq on my Dictionary.  Which obviously wont work since a Dictionary only has Keys and Values.p  pSo thinking Im being clever, I created a class extending code Dictionaryltstring, objectgtcode, ICustomTypeDescriptor.p  pThis allowed me to override codeGetPropertiescode on the type. Which is great.  I can now iterate the Dictionary keys and add them to a codePropertyDescriptorCollectioncode which gets returned.p  pBut then I ran into another problem.  Throughout the Dynamic LINQ library, they work with Expression instance which only contains a Type. But for my codeCustomTypeDescriptorcode solution to work I need an actual instance of the Type, before I can apply codeTypeDescriptor.GetPropertiesinstance, falsecode.p  pSo getting to the actual question. Taking all the above information into account, how do I apply a custom where clause in string format CustomerID1234 AND Quantity  10000 to a LINQ query if the data is stored in a Dictionary with KeyValue pairs.p  pMy current solution is transforming the data into a codeDataTablecode and using the code.Selectquerycode method.  Which works, but Im interested in finding other solutions. Especially for benchmarking purposes.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 29071 pIve been puzzling over this for a few days... feel free to shoot down any of my assumptions.p  pWere using a Dictionary with integer keys. I assume that the value of the key in this case is used directly as the hash. Does this mean if the keys are grouped over a small range that the distribution of the key hash same as the key itself, right will be in a similarly small range, and therefore a bad choice for a hashtablep  pWould it be better to provide an IEqualityComparer that did something clever with primes and modulo mathematics to calculate a better distributed hashp

To do this, I am hoping to write a kext that intercepts events from the multitouch driver, AppleMultitouchDriver.kext, interprets them, and either dispatches new events or forwards the actual event.

I need to be able to reassign the pointer to the callback function as I do in the mouse interceptor and as is done in DoubleCommand. As far as I know, this means I need to reconstruct the AppleMultitouchDevice class.

Im wondering if anyone can provide some resources for building fullclient applications for various mobile platforms, iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Windows Mobile, etc.p  pIm thinking that serving up XML data is going to be the most simple and universal, but parsing XML in objectiveC for example doesnt sound like fun to me, but maybe there are some good libaries out there to help ease this taskp  pIn other words, what formt will be the quickest to implement on the client side Are there any JSON parsrs for iPhone or Android I know there are .NET JSON parsers, but not sure about other platforms  is ther another format that might better Or should I stick with pure XML and deal with it on each platform differentlyp
Negative 29071 pIm trying to upgrade an asp.net c web project from framework 2.0 to 3.5. p  pWhen I do this, the client side script that gets written using RegisterStartupScript isnt rendered on the client page.p  pThis works perfectly when I compile for 2.0, and for 3.0, but not when I compile for 3.5.p  pHere is the code that isnt getting rendered p  precodePage myPage  PageHttpContext.Current.Handler ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScriptmyPage, myPage.GetType, alertscript, alerttest, true codepre  pThis is called from a class project, and not the web project itself, which is why Im using the HttpContext.Current.Handler.p  pThere are no errors getting generated from the compiler, the CLR, and there are no client side JavaScript errors.p  pIf I do a search for the alertscript in my rendered page, the above code actually isnt there.p  pAnyone have ideas as to what is going onp  pstrongEditstrongp  pThis seems to be an issue when Im trying to register the script from an external project.p  pIf I use the exact same code in a class file in the web project not the code behind, it works.

Negative 29071 pweWithin our development environment we have VS2010 installed on my computer along with Expresison blend and silverlight4 tools.  We have a separate build box where we compile and build the entire project. When running through the precompile I am receiving errors that references to the expression blend namespaces cannot be found. I assume this is due to the fact that expresison blend is not installed on the build box. p  pWhat is the best practice to prevent this from happening in the future One solution presented was to just install expression blend on the build box but to me that seems unnecessary. p  pI have also thought of creating a lib direcotry within my projectsolutions files and then add all assemblies there. Then within the references directory add them, but point to the lib directory within the project.

Negative 29071 pIve been having quite a bit of trouble with Google Maps API and a database driven map. In a previous question I had inquired about faster geocoding of addresses to a map and basically what I need to do is store LatLng into the database and create a map from there, instead of geocoding while the map is loading.p  pHowever, Im unsure exactly how to do this. I know the basic premise  1 User registers and enters in their address. 2 Database should store the users information, along with the address. 3 Address needs to be geocoded and then added to the LatLng fields in the database. 4Markers can then be placed on the map by looping through a query involving the LatLng fields.p  pAny ideas how to do this Im using ColdFusion, SQL Server. p

Negative 29071 pI have been working in a branch for a couple months and am now trying to merge the trunk into the branch, before finally merging my branch into the trunk.p  pAfter successfully merging a few revisions, SVN threw an error about the bin folder being locked.  When I created my branch, the folder was called Bin, but at this particular revision that threw the error, another developer inadvertently committed a duplicate directory called bin.  During the merge, SVN attempted to bring down the new bin, but Windows balked, throwing the lock error.p  pMy question is how to deal with this  Although the project in question went through many changes, including deleting the Bin, deleting the bin, and eventually adding the Bin back, I have to replay all of those actions when I am merging revisionbyrevision from the trunk to my branch.  How do I get past the error when it occurred in the past  Do I go into Repo Browser and delete the duplicate bin folder in the old revision  This is very frustrating because it wasnt an error when the other developer checked the duplicate directory in, but it causes an error when trying to mergeupdate that revision to my working copy.p  pAlso, am I supposed to be committing after merging each revision into my branch  Or am I safe to keep merging and commit my branch only at the endp  pThanks for any help you can provide.p

Negative 29071 pHow do I change the color of a regular 2D plot according to a third dimensioncategory For example, suppose we recorded the coolant temperature of a vehicle with time.  We plot that with time on the horizontal axis, and temp on the vertical axis.  We also recorded at each time whether the high temp indicator light was on or off.  When the light was on, we want the plotted light to be red green if the indicator was off.p  pIts basically a plot of 3D data where we assign a particular color of line to the third data dimension z.  I do not want to look at a 3D plot with 3 axes for this particular application just a regular 2D plot changing the line color as appropriate.  p  pThanks   p
Negative 29071 pI have a vbscript and the intended purpose is to connect to Windows servers and execute various subs that pull back various pieces of information about the server.

Negative 29071 pUPDATEp  pThank you all very much for your answers. As Jesse Hall suggested, it looks like it is a driver or hardware problem. I tried the same app on other configurations and it worked as expected.p  pI tested the app on other computers which share the same GPU ATI 4800 HD but different versions of the driver and they all showed the same erroneous behavior what seems to be a double gamma correction on write. On these computers, if have to set D3DRSSRGBWRITEENABLE to false to fix the display. Anyone knows if this is a known bug on this hardwarep  pEven more strange is that I get the same end results with these two configurationsp  ul liD3DRSSRGBWRITEENABLE  FALSE and D3DSAMPSRGBTEXTURE to TRUEli liD3DRSSRGBWRITEENABLE  FALSE and D3DSAMPSRGBTEXTURE to FALSEli ul  pIn the pixel debugger, I see that linearization is applied properly in case 1 but automatic correction on write gives the same output as case 2 which performs no conversion at all...p  p  END OF UPDATEp  pIm having some trouble fixing the gamma correction of a DirectX9 application. p  pWhen I enable texture linearization in the samplers D3DSAMPSRGBTEXTURE and sRGB write for output D3DRSSRGBWRITEENABLE, it looks like gamma correction is applied twice.p  pHere is my setup. I used the following texture from a hrefhttpaltdevblogaday.org20110602yetanotherpostaboutgammacorrection relnofollowherea to draw a fullscreen quad img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrfXVs.png altenter image description herep  pThe results were visually too bright on the right side of the picture. I used PIX to debug one of those grey pixels and, if everything was set up properly, I would have expected an output value of 0.73 0.51.02.2. Unfortunately, the output of the pixel shader was 0.871 which looks like it could be a gamma correction applied twice . I stepped inside the pixel shader with the debugger and the texture fetch returned a value of 0.491, 0.491, 0.491, which should mean linearization on read worked properly.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com44iv7.png altenter image description herep  pWhen I disable D3DRSSRGBWRITEENABLE, the output of the pixel shader is 0.729 which looks much more correct to me.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtXnc8.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLqAwU.png altenter image description herep  pAny idea where does this conversion come from in the debugger the pixel shader output was 0.491 What other flagsrender states should I checkp  pThank you very much for your helpp

Negative 29071 pI am trying to build a domain model with business methods and have EF 4.1 doing the persistence for me. So far so good.p  pProblem is, all properties are exposed as public on my domain classes. Thats at least what I learnt from the tutorial anyway. That means, I have no strong proof that class properties wont change by some careless programmers outside of business methods. Encapsulation violated.p  pI tried introducing ISomething but TableAttribute applies only to classes, not interfaces, so I cant tell EF to do DBSet. If I leave TableAttribute to classes but make Something implement ISomething anyway then I cant do DBSet.Add because EF doesnt know ISomething.p  pThe only way I can think of is write a complete abstraction layer on top of EF 4.1 for CRUD using interfaces. Under the hood, do the type translation between Something and ISomething. It sounded a lot of complexity and a gaping hole in EFs design. Or I mustve missed something.p  pHow would you solve thisp  pMany thanks.p

Negative 29071 pI was profiling a program today at work that does a lot of buffered network activity, and this program spent most of its time in memcpy, just moving data back and forth between librarymanaged network buffers and its own internal buffers.p  pThis got me thinking, why doesnt intel have a memcpy instruction which allows the RAM itself or the offCPU memory hardware to move the data around without it ever touching the CPU  As it is every word must be brought all the way down to the CPU and then pushed back out again, when the whole thing could be done asynchronously by the memory itself.p  pIs there some architecture reason that this would not be practical Obviously sometimes the copies would be between physical memory and virtual memory, but those cases are dwindling with the cost of RAM these days.  And sometimes the processor would end up waiting for the copy to finish so it could use the result, but surely not always.p

Negative 29071 pRegarding to my other question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7226456xmldeserializenullelementsXML deserialize null elementsap  pIve got elements like these from a thirdparty server for API testingp  precodeltTaxable gt ltDefaultPurchasePrice gt codepre  pI just realized that now I am confusing myself about whether elements like that represent null object or empty. p  pTalking about objects, they are same, null object normally means empty object reference right But trying to map a XML element to a datafieldvalue, they could be different i.e null string is empty string, but for Decimal price or Boolean value, they are undefined which equal to empty, but will not be null, unless they are defined as nullable. p  pAgain, the problem with my XmlSerializer is that wouldnt handle transfer an empty element like that. could I easily fix that in my code. Or should I ask people provide the XML have a well defined XML Because seems that an empty XML element like that is undefined it is here, but could be either null or empty doesnt matter for XML element itself But for that element my code need figure out how to deal with that, unless I set all my C class datafield as string type. Otherwise, if my code trying to directly map an empty or null XML element to a certain datafield, it will fail for sure.p  pI have to ask this question because I encountered XML have lots of those elements and for those special elements, my .NET XMLserialization code need to mapped those field as string and if the string is not empty, I case them into correspondent datatype, otherwise I set them to null. And I end up remove those empty element before I do my deserialization because it is much easier. But I do wandering What am I really doing in my code strongDid I just remove null elements or empty elements Because they are clearly differentstrong But people writing that XML think they are same, because XML itself dont have concept of null, and some people argue that it is my responsibility to decide whether it is null or empty. But XML do enable you to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions774192whatisthecorrectwaytorepresentnullxmlelementsrepresent null elements in a clearer wayap  pEditp  pIn the example I presented, those two elements clearly should be null rather than empty elements. XML dont really have a concept of null, but those elements could either be omitted if they are null, dont put them into XML or using better representation as mentioned be svick. Or in other cases, empty elements should be used when they make sense. But not for Decimal or Boolean. p

Negative 29071 pIve created a class which processes files and if it encounters certain specific errors, it outputs relevant error messages to the error stream. p  pI am working on another class that needs to access these error messages. Im not sure how to do this. I am a beginner in Java programming. Based on my limited knowledge, I thought that my two options would be to either call the main method of the first class but I dont know how I would get the error messages in this case or to execute the compiled class and access the messages through the getErrorStream method of the Process class. But, I am having trouble with the system deadlocking or possibly not even executing the exec command, so Im not sure how implement the second case either. p

Negative 29071 pI recently started a new job, and one of the first things I noticed everybody talking about was updating emAllem our .NET apps to x64.

Negative 29071 pIve been trying to come up with a way to declare array constants in a class, and then present the members of the arrays as grouped options in a select control.

Negative 29071 pI recently started maintaining an old EJB2 application running on OC4J. That includes EJB doclet and other horrible horrible things.

Negative 29071 pIn order to start processing a batch command, I need to call a different script from the page that I am on, but I need to reassure that the was not called by anyone else.p  pLet me explain.p  pI need to contact my Credit Card Clearing company to issue a batch of transactions. these transactions MUST ONLY bwe taken out due to a specific user request.p  pIf by mistake the command is taken out just by someone else this is a complete disaster.p  pI thought to take the script I need to call outside the website scope, for example a folder that neighbours the includes folder, and call it with a parameter, something likep  precodephp ....batch.phpid5ampprocessall codepre  pBut the thing is, that inside strongbatch.phpstrong I cannot verify that the command was issued by anyone.

Negative 29071 pIm trying to build Python models using Elixir representing tables in an existing MySQL database connected via a codemysqlpyodbccode connection string.  Elixir reflects the column structure effortlessly, but doesnt seem to be able to reflect the relationships, so now Im trying to specify those.  Im having a beast of a time with the syntax, both the declarative and the DSL forms.p  pAs an example, I have a foreign key relationship across two tables onetoone created with the following SQL statementsp  precodeALTER TABLE db.person     ADD CONSTRAINT fkpersonidrefpersonprogramid     FOREIGN KEY personid REFERENCES db.personprogrampersonid  ALTER TABLE db.personprogram     ADD CONSTRAINT fkpersonprogramidrefpersonid     FOREIGN KEY personid REFERENCES db.personpersonid codepre  pIn both tables, codepersonidcode is the primary key.  My sense after reading the documentation which unfortunately focuses heavily on autocreated databases and not so much on connecting to existing ones is that the constraint namesindexes are perhaps the problem.p  pIm attempting to use a codeOneToOnecode or codehasonecode relationship to model the first constraint, and a codeManyToOnecode or codebelongstocode relationship for the second.  In each case Ive tried, Ive gotten errors, including instructions to use the codeprimaryjoincode keyword argument, but this hasnt helped either.p  pRelatedly, Ive got a similar situation with a codeOneToManycode or codehasmanycode relationship, defined on the database with the following SQL codep  precodeALTER TABLE db.personbyage     ADD CONSTRAINT fkpersonbyageidrefpersonid     FOREIGN KEY personid REFERENCES db.personpersonid codepre  pHere, codepersonidcode is the primary key of the codepersoncode table, but not of the codepersonbyagecode table.  This constraint gives similar errors in Elixir to the above.p  pHas anyone done this before  How can I specify these relationships to use the existing foreign key constraints and indexes already in the databasep  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 29071 pNearly all websites use CAPTCHA images to protect their forms from spam. But is this the most secure way As far as i understand, the idea of CAPTCHA is to challenge the user with an image containing some hardtorecognize text so that if the visitor is a human being not a bot heshe will be able to post data but not machines. The website sends the captcha code image and a session variable containing perhaps a hashed version of the captcha image the correct answer but hashed. The user submits the form and the server has to make sure that the hash of the letters heshe typed  the hash contained in the session variable.  Fine, what if i the spammer wrote a piece of software that mimics that same request and sends it to the server in other words, if the captcha is abc123 and the hash in the session variable which can be read with any HTTP sniffer is xyz345 consider this a 32 character string and i sent this data to the server in a post request Then i start to be more creative, i put this code in a 10,000 loop that will overwhelm the server with spam data Now is CAPTCHA that secure are their any options by which i can face such a threat Thanksp

Is there any way to keep my Model class as it is and still be notified on changes inside it in the viewmodel class if there is no other way than using INotifyPropertyChanged mechanism or anything similar which will be implemented in the model why do I need VM  is it just for a situation that aggregate few model classes into one class which will be served to the Viewp  pI think I must be missing something in my understanding cause it seems to me according to what I described that a Model to View pattern while using the View codebehind as a controller would be better abstraction than MVVM, but I certainly not sure about that. Can someone explain to me what I am missing thanks.p

Kind of an MDI style interface, but it is not an MDI window..  Each one can be individually resized.  All works lovely unless Aero is enabled and the DWM is active.p  pstrongResizing any window not even the opengl ones causes all of the opengl windows to flicker occasionally with a stale backingstore view that contains whatever rubbish has been on the screen at that point that is not opengl.  This ONLY happens with Aero enabled.strongp  pIm pretty certain that this is the DWM not actually having the opengl contents on its drawing surface backing store and the window not being repainted at the right moment.p  pIve tried so many things to get round this, I do have a solution but it is not very nice and involves reading the framebuffer with glReadPixels into a DIB and then blitting it to the paint DC in my onPaint routine.  This workaround is only enabled if DWM is active but Id rather not have to do this at all as it hurts performance slightly but not too bad on a capable system  the scenes are relatively simple 3d graphs.  Also mixing GDI and opengl is not recommended but this approach works, surprisingly.  I can live with it for now but Id rather not have to.  I still have to do this in WMPRINT if I want to take a screenshot of the child window anyway, I dont see a way around that.p  pstrongDoes anyone know of a better solution to thisstrongp  pstrongBefore anyone asks I definitely do the followingstrongp  ul liWindow class has CSOWNDCli liWMERASEBACKGROUND does nothing and returns TRUE.li liDouble Buffering is enabled.li liWindows have the WSCLIPSIBLINGS and WSCLIPCHILDREN window styles.li liIn my resize event handler I immediately repaint the window.li ul  pIve triedp  ul liSetting PFDSUPPORTCOMPOSITION in the pixel format descriptor.li liNot using a wxPaintDC in the paint handler and calling ValidateRecthwnd, NULL instead.li liHandling WMNCPAINT and excluding the client areali liDisabling NC paint via the DWM APIli liExcluding the client area in the paint eventli liCalling glFlush andor glFinish before and after the buffer swap.li liInvalidating the window at every paint event as a test  still flickersli liNot using a shared GL context.li liDisabling double buffering.li liWriting to GLFRONTANDBACKli ul  pDisabling DWM is not an option.  p  pstrongAnd as far as I am aware this is even a problem if you are using Direct3D instead on OpenGLstrong, though I have not tested this as it represents a lot of work.p

Negative 29071 pI am building my web UI using ExtJS and I like their MVC architecture. I was planning to do the business logic all in ASP.NET MVC as a middle layer between the UI and the database, using XML or JSON as standard data format between the two. Now, ASP.NET MVC can also generate the UI by integrating ExtJS with it. Do you think this integration is a good architectural decision, i.e. clean separation of concerns and easy to maintainunderstandp

Negative 29071 pI am using a SurfaceView to draw to a part of the screen, whereby I update the drawing with a background thread. The surfaceview implements a SurfaceView.callback.p  pOn the onDraw method I am using canvas.drawpontx,y,paint and draw to pretty much the entire canvas pixel by pixel, so it can be quite intensive on large screens. Anyway, I get an illegalArgumentException if I rotate the phone quickly between landscape and reverse landscape.

And of course I have also locked the canvas prior to calling onDraw. p  pThis method works flawlessly if I rotate slowly in every direction, however, the moment I quickly rotate 180degs between the two landscape states it triggers this illegalArgumentException. Upon monitoring the width and height in surfaceChanged, I noticed that when I rotate quickly, the width of landscape get paired with the height of portrait. For example, on my phone Motorola atrix the dimensions of the SurfaceView for portrait are 540x307 WidthxHeight, and for landscape are 960x172. This is what happens when I rotate quickly between landscape and reverse landscapep  pRotate to landscape slowly p  precode960x172 codepre  pRotate quickly to reverse landscape, surface changed gets called twice.p  precode960x307  1st 960x172  2nd codepre  pI have tried overriding onMeasure and the width and Height are identical to that of SurfaceChanged.

Negative 29071 pMy understanding is that CloudFlare is a CDN that specializes in thwarting DDoS attacks for web apps that is basically creates a readonly cache of your entire app so that, if you are DDoSed, your users can still access portions of your app and not experience a total denial of service.p  pMy understanding of Dynamic DNS is that it is a technology that somehow allows you to immediately change the DNS settings of your web app URL without having to wait the standard 24 hours for DNS changes to ripple out over all the DNS servers in the world and take affect.p  pSo first off, if anything I have said so far is misguided or incorrect, please begin by correcting mep  pAssuming I am more or less correct, Im trying to protect my web app as best as I can against DDoS attacks.p  pFor one, I have decided to host my app with either Google App Engine or Heroku havent made the final decision yet, and I have to imagine that their IT staff is fully prepared to scale uphandle if my app is DDoSed while deployed to their servers.p  pUnfortunately for me, that means theyll emscale up and handleem the attack , which means my billing would soar through the roof and Id be out of business I guess thats called a cash attack.p  pSo I need a solution that handles both of the following scenariosp  ul liThe DDoS is enormous, and even GoogleHeroku say enough is enough, were not supporting this loadli liI specify a billing ceiling which both Google and Heroku provide, and after that ceiling is reached, I somehow redirect traffic to my CloudFlarereadonly web app hosted elsewhereli ul  pI suspect I will need to use Dynamic DNS somehow to handle the 2nd scenario, but without knowing how most web apps fortify themselves against DDoSes i.e. Ive hear of so called bastion hosts Im not even sure if Im heading down the right path or not.

Negative 29071 pLet me put down my requirements, we are designing a solution to satisfy the very dynamic reporting needs. The data for those are generated in sqlite databases for nowthey caled it the cubes so there are lots of cubes on the server machines. The charts which are created on those cubes are developed on telerik reporting engine. They are set of dlls which access the cube data and prepare the chart for UI. The thing that stays the same is the schema. every type of cube has certain schema and sticks with it.p  pThere are new charts after every now and then. I dont wanna mmake it part of new framework to include new chart or chart templates every other day. So i was planning to host it in separate service and call the service to get the data from the framework and process it to create the chart. p  pNow the issue is the size of the data to be transfered through the wire, which can be of huge size before any business logic applied to it for charting. p  pSo what can be the suggestion to make it more modular, scalable but somehow make it workable as well. I mean is this even a good approachp

Negative 29071 pI am currently working on an OSGi project on Felix v4.0.3. I need to use JPA so I have installed the Apache Aries JPA bundles. I also installed OpenJPA   and I need it to connect to a MySQL Database, using the MySQL Connector Bundle. Unfortunately it does not work, OpenJPA says it cannot find the MySQL JDBC class and I cannot figure out whats broken, maybe I am doing something wrong. Ill explain below what I installed precisely along with the persistence.xml file and the actual exception I get.p  pHeres the list of the Apache Aries bundles I installed  p  ol liorg.apache.aries.jpa.api0.3.jarli liorg.apache.aries.jpa.container.context0.3.jarli liorg.apache.aries.jpa.container0.3.jarli liorg.apache.aries.util0.4.jarli ol  pI then installed the dependencies of those Apache Aries JPA bundles.

I found bundles strong2 to 5strong commons in the stronglibstrong folder of the strongapacheopenjpa2.2.0strong downloaded folder. I downloaded Serp a hrefhttpwww.jarvana.comjarvanaarchivedetailsorgapacheservicemixbundlesorg.apache.servicemix.bundles.serp1.13.14org.apache.servicemix.bundles.serp1.13.14.jarherea because the jar found in the lib folder wasnt an OSGi bundle. Finally I found the last two bundles 7 and 8 in Springsource p  ol liopenjpa2.2.0.jarli licommonscollections3.2.1.jarli licommonsdbcp1.4.jarli licommonslang2.4.jarli licommonspool1.5.4.jarli liorg.apache.servicemix.bundles.serp1.13.14.jarli licom.springsource.javax.servlet2.5.0.jarli licom.springsource.org.objectweb.asm3.2.0.jarli ol  pOnce I finally had OpenJPA installed, I still needed the MySQL JDBC Driver bundle, which I also got from the Springsource repository along with its commonslogging dependency p  ol licom.springsource.com.mysql.jdbc5.1.6.jarli licom.springsource.org.apache.commons.logging1.1.1.jarli ol  pNow at this point the list of bundles installed is getting quite large. I said I installed OpenJPA but its only because I could not figure out how to use any other provider with Aries. I initially wanted to use EclipseLink but apparently Apache Aries does not detect it as a provider and according to a hrefhttpjaxenter.comtutorialusingjpainanosgienvironment366613.htmlthis bloga you have to make yet another bundle containing your own activator for Aries to notice EclipseLink.

Negative 29071 pWe have adopted a code first approach which we like well enough.  However,  we have encountered on procedural issue  our SQL DBA likes to make changes to the database via SQL Management Studio.  He can communicate these changes to us and we can make the changes in our model.  This works fine if we are just chaning the type of a an existing field.  However, if a column is added to the table first, yes I know its called code first ,  and then add that property to our class we run into issues  as we are told our model has changed,  we run update database and then we are told that the field already exists.   What is the best work around in this situation   p

Negative 29071 pI am using the latest version of ionic zip version 1.9.1.8.I have set the property of ionic zip  codeParallelDeflateThreshold  0code. The zipping mechanism was working perfectly for the past two months.Suddenly this stopped working.The zipping thread just hangs,ionic zip just created the tmp file and failed to create the zip file. I could easily reproduce this issue even with small file size.p  pMy analysis for this issue is as followsp  pThe issue was with the latest version of ionic zip, in this case the ionic zip hanged while creating the zip files. We noticed that, a couple of other users who uses this dll has also reported such errors in their site. Please refer a hrefhttpdotnetzip.codeplex.comreleasesview68268the linka.This issue will be solved by disabling codeParallelThresholdcode property of ionic zip, but it will delay the performance for large log files, since it works on single thread instead of multithreaded mode.p  pThe issue was solved now by setting codeParallelDeflateThresholdcode property to default value.But I couldnt find the exact cause of this issue.Why does the zipping fail suddenly There was no machine change.p
Negative 29071 pLets say we have SocketChannel in nonblocking mode that registered with Selector for read interest. Lets say after select Selector tells us that this channel is ready for read and we have some ByteBuffer. We want to read some bytes from our channel to this buffer ByteBuffer is cleared before reading. For this we use channels read method that returns actual number of bytes read. Lets suppose that this number is positive after read from channel and also ByteBuffers method  hasRemaining returns true. Is it practical in this situation to immediately try to read from same channel some more The same question for write. If write returns positive value and not all contents of the buffer was sent, is it practical to immediately try again until write returns zerop
Negative 29071 pstrongThe problemstrong p  pWhen programming with play framework I feel that Im stumbling with same problem than in many times at the past which is strongcreating several models of the same typestrong just because I want to add, update or use different data about certain model in different use cases.p  pLet me explain, lets consider of a example where I have 2 different views strongregisterstrong and strongloginstrongp  pI would have following User modelp  precode   Example User class simple annotations for demo purposes.      Entity public class User       Id     public Long id      Required     public String email      Required     public String password      Required     public String firstName      Required     public String lastName   codepre  pstrongIn case of registeringstrong I would have all corresponding fields in register.scala.html  ememail, password, firstName, lastNameem  because I will need them all when I register, rightp  pBut also I would want to use repeatPassword field to confirm that user has typed password correctly, so I would add this into User modelp  precodeRequired Transient public String repeatPassword codepre  pOk, then I would extend this model to have repeat password confirmation check in order to correct my automatic validations when form is submitted, like thisp  precodepublic String validate  ifpassword.equalsrepeatPassword      return Passwords doesnt match.      return null   codepre  pSo even now I would have one extra attribute repeatPassword which is not persisted to database but used within registration. p  pstrongProblem 1strong Our model starts to go confusing piece by piece.p  pstrongIn case of loginstrong I would want to use same model because its a User which is trying to sign in, right But instead of all the fields I would only need ememail, password.emp  pstrongProblem 2strong My User model cant be used in login because its already customized to be used within registration  I would need to move repeatPassword and validate method to separate UserRegistation model, plus duplicate firstName lastName etc. fields or mix using both User and UserRegistration model within registration and to render two different forms to same registration view  confusing.p  pstrongProblem 3strong My login page cant use User model because it has annotations in place, if I dont add all the necessary fields like firstName, lastName etc. I will get errors. Again, I would need to create separate UserLogin model just because I want to login to work. Example belowp  precodepublic class UserLogin       Required     public String email      Required     public String password      public String validate          ifUser.authenticateemail, password  null              return Invalid user or password                  return null        codepre  pSo very fast, I would have 3 different models just to represent User, one of them is persisted to database and two others is used to validate errors when we are completing login and registration functionality at template side. p  pSo my question is How on earth I should begin to solve this mess code complexity is rising very fast  Should I create separate models.template and models.database packages where template models are only ones within annotations and in case of no errors I start to fill real model before saving or updating its info to database I need desperately answers from you guysgirls, strongCan we make one model approachstrong thnx in advance.p

Negative 29071 pThe scenario  I have a UI that contains a codeJPanelcode call it codetopGridcode with a grid layout in a codeJFramecode at the top level.  Within codetopGridcode, I have placed another codeJPanelcode codemidGridcode with grid layout.  Inside codemidGridcode, is another codeJPanelcode codebottomGridcode that has a codeJLabelcode that I populate with images depending on an array and what their instance is within that array.  p  pThe goal I would like the codetopGridcode to center its view on a specific object found in codebottomGridcode.  Picture a game that as the player icon moves, the games grid moves to center on that icon and also when the game is started it is already centered for the user.  p  pIve considered getting the Point from codebottomGridcode and trying to pass it over to codetopGridcode but doesnt seem to pull the correct information. The only way i know to find where the player is, is to iterate through all the components and check instances.  this would have to be done once for the topGrid and again for midGrid to find the player at bottomGrid.  then pass the Point data.  Then use setLocation on the appropriate codeJPanelcode minus the distance from the center.p  pHas anyone else tried this and have a more effective or elegant way to go about it  What other options could I explore  p  pThanks for any feedback.p  pCreating the grid within codetopGridcodes codeJPanelcodep  precodepublic void createTopGrid      int rows  galaxy.getNumRows     int columns  galaxy.getNumColumns      pnlGrid.removeAll     pnlGrid.setLayoutnew GridLayoutrows, columns      for int row  0 row lt rows row              for int col  0 col lt columns col                      Position pos  new Positiongalaxy, row, col             Sector sector  galaxy.getSectorpos             GalaxySector sectorUI  new GalaxySectorsector             pnlGrid.addsectorUI                codepre  pCreating the grid within codemidGridcodes codeJPanelcodep  precodepublic void createOccupantIcons      pnlGridOccupants.removeAll      Occupant[] occs  sector.getOccupantsAsArray      for  Occupant occ  occs                GalaxyOccupant occupant  new GalaxyOccupantocc, sector          pnlGridOccupants.addoccupant       codepre  pThe Image icons for each occupant in the codemidGridcode are pulled from an codeIconRepcode codeStringcode in the model in the codebottomGridcode class codeJPanelcode and added into a codeJLabelcode as needed in codeFlowLayoutcode.p  pFor visual reference  p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.combA8qG.png altimagep  pWhere green square is codetopGridcode codeJPanelcode, red squares are codemidGridcode codeJPanelcode, and the black square is the codebottomGridcode codeJPanelcode with the white circle for the player image inside a codeJLabelcode.

Negative 29071 pI have two CUDA functions that manipulate linked lists in global memory. The function codepmalloccode removes the head element of one of the lists. It first chooses a list and then calls codepmallocBucketcode which actually removes the head element. Should the chosen list be empty, codepmalloccode will try other lists. The codepfreecode function on the other hand will insert a new head element into a list.p  pMutual exclusion is achieved through semaphores, one each for each linked list. The implementation for the semaphores is from the book emCUDA By Exampleem. In some other test code, the semaphore works perfectly.p  pThe problem I have with the code is the following Sometimes, several threads will try to access the same linked list simultaneously. These accesses are succesfully sequentialized by the semaphore, but sometimes, a thread will remove the same head element from the list as a previous thread. This may happen immediately consecutively, or there can be one or more other threads in between.

Negative 29071 pI have a homework about random graphs. I cant understand the question. Can anyone please clarify to me what I am supposed to dop  pLet codeNcode be a positive integer and codepcode be a number between 0 and 1. An codeN, pcode random graph is a graph generated by the following procedure p  pDraw codeNcode vertices, denoted by code1, 2, . . . , Ncode respectively for every pair codeu, vcode of different vertices, with probability codepcode, connect the two vertices with an edge. A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between any two vertices.p  pIn this lab, you will write code to generate large random graphs and investigate the connectedness of such graphs.p  pWe will fix codeNcode to be code500,000code but let p vary in code0.05, 0.10, 0.15, ..., 0.95code. For each value of p, you need to create 100 codeN, pcode random graphs. You need to develop a method and of course implement it in your program to determine if a graph is connected. Then for each value of p, you need to count the number codeMcode of random graphs that are connected, and investigate the relationship between codeMcode which reflects the probability that a random graph is connected and codepcode.p

I cant just change the href of the anchor, because for the page transition to happen it has to be linked to an ID associated with the datatypepage, and I cant just append my id to the end of this either because it still wont trigger the page transition.  p  pAny input would be appreciated.

Negative 29071 pThere are plenty iOS crash reporting libraries in iOS, including a hrefhttpstestflightapp.comTestFlighta and a hrefhttphockeyapp.netHockeyAppa. If you dont want to depend on services, you can still use libraries like a hrefhttpcode.google.compplcrashreporterPLCrashReportera. Binding these libraries is a hrefhttpdocs.xamarin.comiosGuidesAdvancedTopicsBindingObjectiveCLibrariesfairly triviala because their public API usually consists of a couple of classes with several initialization methods.p  pHowever, when trying to use TestFlight, and later HockeyApp in our application, our app began to randomly crash.

Instead, the app will crash.  codepre  pWhy does this happen Quoting Rolf, a Xamarin developer,p  blockquote   pA null reference exception is actually a SIGSEGV signal at first. Usually the   mono runtime handles this and translates it into a nullreference exception,   allowing the execution to continue. The problem is that SIGSEGV signals are a   very bad thing in ObjC apps and when it occurs outside of managed code, so   any crash reporting solution will report it as a crash and kill the app    this happens before MonoTouch gets a chance to handle the SIGSEGV, so there is   nothing MonoTouch can do about this.p blockquote  pIm sure many use TestFlight in MonoTouch apps without knowing it causes crashes.br a hrefhttpfgk.hanau.netarticlesironic.htmlIsnt it ironica  p  pstrongHow do you make crash reporting libraries emnotem crash MonoTouch appsstrongp
Negative 29071 pI am new to MongoDB so I apologize if these questions are simple.p  pI am developing an application that will track specific user interactions and put information about the user and the interactions into a MongoDB.

Negative 29071 pI have a WCF workflow using AppFabric  Persistence and .net 4.0 that I know is going to have a few bugs in the code activities due to the fact that its talking to an external soap service that sometimes throws SoapExceptions as return values when an operation cannot be completed. Its unavoidable, and there are an extreme amount of exceptions to handle them all from the getgo.p  pWhile developing, when these errors occur, my workflow suspends, and I can track down the error fairly easily, and code a handler for the newly found soap exception.   The problem is, after I make changes to the codeactivity and publish the new dll, a resume of the suspended workflow does not utilize these changes, nor can I break in the code upon resume.p  pThe workflows try their 5 times to run, then rethrow the same error, even if it was something like throw new exception TEST EXCEPTION and then i removed it from code.p  pI am NOT changing the definition of the workflow, just making small changes to codeactivities.p  pI swear I could do this in VS2010 but its been a long time since i switched to vs2012.  FYI I can debug new workflows that have not been suspended. I can step through the code.  Just cannot debug ones upon resume.p

Negative 29071 pWhat are the strategies for optimizing onetoone database joins, except indexing and possibly merging the tablesp  pAssume the tables contain 1 million rows in each.p
Negative 29071 pSuppose my data consist of fruits, described by their color and shape and more features. I would like to return maximum of X fruits that have the features the user stated and I would like to do it in the minimum num of questions.p  pThe first questions I always ask the user are what is the color and shape of the fruit. According to the user answer I would like to ask for K more features like texture size peel type etc.. I would like K to be the smallest num that will return the most accurate X results therefore I would like to know what is the next feature I should ask the user for. My DB consist of fruits classified to features arbitrary values. p  pIs it a machine learning problem  What is the algoritm I should use and which implementation I should use. Ive tried to look in scikitlearn, nltk, weka for suitable algorithm to answer this problem. Either those algorithm are not suitable for answering this problem or I need more specific guiding using them.p  pThank youp

Negative 29071 pI am currently working on a project, in Java, that deals with interruptions. My aim is to learn when it is a good time to interrupt the user. At the moment my current method is to have a list of windows that should not be interrupted and compare that to the window that is in focus every 3 seconds and then use keyboard hooks to detect if they are typing. p  pHowever, I have come across the issue that Microsoft Word and many other programs dont have fixed window titles. If a user wants to add Microsoft Word to the dont interrupt list then it will just add the file name that is currently being worked on rather than something that can be used to uniquely identify Microsoft Windows. Another example is twitter, if the user adds codetwittercode to the list then it wont consider code15 twittercode to be equivalent.p  pIs there any alternative method that can be used to detect which program the window title belongs to or a string searching method that may be ideal for this problemp  pI am also open to entirely new methods on how this could be done.p

Our GTV apps current version is 1203010007 and phonetablet apps current version is 1714010016.p  pWe want to release an update 1714010017 to our Android phone app. I am able to upload the phone apk on the old version of the play store but when I try to submit the same on the new version of the play store, it throws the errors below. These errors have been showing up for a while when I switch to the new version of the play store. p  pemThis configuration cannot be published for the following reasonsemp  pAll devices that might receive version 1714010016 would receive version 1714010017.

Negative 29071 pAs Ive been learning haskell Ive enjoyed the pure parts but now I am stumbling through the monadic and IO parts and probably experiencing what some people find truly infuriating about the language.  I solving a project euler problem and I simple want a mutable array because I have to update elements frequently by index.  I tried Vectors but couldnt get them working so I tried Data.Array.IO.  I can read and write elements fine but I cant display the array in terminal the way I want. So far I have this.p  precodetest  do     arr lt newArray 1,10 37  IO IOArray Int Int     a lt readArray arr 1     writeArray arr 1 64     b lt readArray arr 1     dispArray arr      return   dispArray arr  do     a,b lt getBounds arr     printf [     dispArray arr a     printf ]n         where dispArray arr i  do                 a,b lt getBounds arr                 if i lt a  i gt b                     then return                      else do                         v lt readArray arr i                         print v                         dispArray arr i1 codepre  pThe ouput of this as you would expect is thisp  precode[64 37 37 37 37 37 37 37 37 37 ] codepre  pBut this is inconvenient and I want this code[64,37,37,37....code like this.  Ive seen functions that are something like codetoListcode, but I dont want this.  I dont want to convert to a list everytime I display.  So I figured I would need to use codeprintfcode.  So I replaced codeprint vcode with codeprintf  s, show vcode.  But this doesnt compile. I dont know why.  I thought it would because codeprint  Show a gt a gt IO code and codeshow  Show a gt a gt Stringcode so why wouldnt it work because codescode signifies a string  So I then put to calls next to each other.  To see if printf would even work.p  precodeprintf  s, hello print v codepre  pWhich compiles and displaysp  precode[ hello,64  hello,37  hello,37  hello,37  hello,37  hello,37  hello,37  hello,37  hello,37  hello,37 ] codepre  pWhy can I not use codeshow vcode  Why is haskell IO so infuriating to beginnersp

Negative 29071 pI am in the middle of creating WPF utility library but Im stuck on how to create an easy to use enumeration converter which will help in binding any enumeration to a ComboBox control and when enumeration is declared with [Flags] attribute, ComboBox will contain checkboxes data bound to it. Solution needs to be generic so that it will be easy to use for any enumeration and I suppose it would need fresh pair of eyes of an experienced WPF developer.p  pSo far Ive come up with a combination of ObjectDataProvider as a source of enum items and 2 converters, one for ItemsSource and another for SelectedValue. I used CollectionView as a base class for ItemsSource to use CurrentChanged but it does not work as I tried to raise OnCurrentChanged after the collection has been notified about any CheckBox being checked without converters ConvertBack being executed.p  pThe problem is that data bound property to which ComboBox SelectedValue property is bound, is not updated unless Ill change the selected item not tick the checkbox. Ive set IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem but it did not help.p  pHow to force updating of SelectedValue from data bound object I have a freedom of choice so the solution might involve custom attached properties, inheriting from ComboBox etc. Being really new to WPF I think although the solution is almost right as it almost works, there can be a simpler way of getting to it.p  pAnother issue would be how to customize text displayed on ComboBox so it will contain aggregated selections of ticked checkboxes.p  pI uploaded VS2012 project a hrefhttpwww.opamo.comCheckComboTest.7z relnofollowherea. The structure of a project resembles real application with resources held separately for simplicity in App.xaml.p  pSorry I have not included any code but there is a lot of code involved.p  pBelow is the XAML declaration for a CheckBox bound to standard enumeration although enumeration used is with [Flags], which works fine and further a CheckBox bound to [Flags] enumeration.p  precodeltComboBox ItemsSourceBinding SourceStaticResource someItemsSource               SelectedValueBinding BindToSomeItems               StyleStaticResource enumComboBoxgt ltComboBox ItemsSourceBinding BindToSomeItems, ConverterlocalLocalizedFlagsEnumConverter               IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItemTrue               SelectedValueBinding BindToSomeItems, ModeTwoWay, ConverterlocalSelectedFlagsEnumConverter               StyleStaticResource flagsComboBox     gt codepre  pAnd resources which explain usage of value convertersp  precodeltApplication.Resourcesgt     ltStyle xKeyenumComboBox TargetTypexType ComboBoxgt         ltSetter PropertyItemTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltDataTemplategt                     ltTextBlock TextBinding Path.,ModeOneWay, ConverterlocalLocalizedEnumConverter StylexNullgt                 ltDataTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt         ltSettergt     ltStylegt     ltStyle xKeyflagsComboBox TargetTypexType ComboBoxgt         ltSetter PropertyItemTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltDataTemplategt                     ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt                         ltCheckBox IsCheckedBinding PathChecked,ModeTwoWaygt                         ltTextBlock TextBinding PathName,ModeOneWaygt                     ltStackPanelgt                 ltDataTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt         ltSettergt     ltStylegt ltApplication.Resourcesgt codepre

Negative 29071 pIm having problems with the relation between nested classes and subclasses.

Negative 29071 pOkay, so Ive been banging my head against this problem for a while now months. But I cant seem to find a simple solution to creating a calendar with Javascript that allows my to dynamically add events to it AND support multiday events.p  pMy first approach was using divs with yearmonthday associated IDs so I can easily add events, the issue here is that there is no way to support multiday events, adding single day events is easy though.p  pMy latest approach was to dissect the google calendar, they apparently use tables, which is a good solution as it supports multiday event blocks easily using colspan, however addingrendering events on a table seems to be an entirely different feat, as I cant simply add them to a columncell block. I have to generate a new row, and then if it is a multiday event that pushes events down, I would have to rerender those parts of the calendar as well. Here is a link to my current dynamic approach that Ive been working on a hrefhttpsr3dux.comcsscaldyn.php relnofollowhttpsr3dux.comcsscaldyn.phpap  pand here is a static version to show what it is supposed to look like with events on it a hrefhttpsr3dux.comcsscal.php relnofollowhttpsr3dux.comcsscal.phpap  pI do NOT want to use a thirdparty calendar of any sort. I want to do this with pure Javascript, NO Jquery or other frameworks.p  pIf you could simply give me some suggestions or different ways to approach this, that would be super helpful.p  pThe basic requirements are that it has multiday event support, can be adapted into a week view only shows the current and next week, and allows me to display individual startend times for each day of an event.

Negative 29071 pGenerically, Im wondering how I would store secondary data based on the type of primary data.p  pHeres the realworld situation.  When adding students to my database, I want to start their referral.  This will be done by referencing a table called referrer that stores a list of options that will appear in a dropdown box, as suchp  precode  referrerid  referrer                   1        Student             2  Search Engine             3             Ad   codepre  pSo in the students table, Ill store the referrerid  Easy enough.p  pBased on the selection, Id like the user to be able to enter secondary information.  For instance, if they choose Student from the list, a second dropdown box will appear presenting them with a list of existing students so they can specify which student was the referrer, and I would want to store the studentid.  If they chose either Search Engine, I would present them with a text box where they can enter the name of the search engine, and I would store that text.p  pSo my question is, how should me students table be structured in order to hold this information, since sometimes Ill be storing a studentid, or the text entered in a box, or...   My initial thought is to create additional columns in the students table to hold the various possibilities, but that seems both messy and not scalable, so I dont care for it.  Im wondering if an additional crossreference table would be warranted here, that would hold the studentid, the referrerid, and then a value such as the referring studentid, or the value entered into the text box.  Or perhaps instead of value, I could have valueid, valuetext, and so on for different data type possibilities.  The value of referrerid in this table would tell me which column contains the data I want.  While this seems cleaner than expanding out the students table, it does still seem a bit messy.p

Negative 29071 pWhat Im doing is a simple map on one tab of an office space that has all the cubicals laid out.  On this map, I have conditional formatting checking another table of listen computers for the last time they were updatedmaintained.  It works as it stands, but we are moving into a new building and the map which is already done has WAY more cubes than last time.  So Im trying to figure out a more efficient way to do this task.p  pHere is the codep  precodeANDVLOOKUPCCA C1,LOCATION,3,FALSEltgt,VLOOKUPCCA C1,LOCATION,3,FALSEltTODAY80 codepre  pSo as it sits, it works fine.  But what Im trying to do is change the CCA C1 to simply read the contents of the cell its formatting so I can just format an entire range of cells rather than doing it cell by cell.  The CCA C1 is in the location of the second sheet its a named range.  So this checks that entire range for CCA C1 and checks if the date a couple columns over in that row is within 80 days, if its not it highlights the cell in the map in red reminding us we need to check the computer.  But what I would like to do is simply put CCA C1 in the cell in the map which is already is labeled, and have this check for the value of the cell its formatting and look for that value the same way its looking now.  Just without me having to put CCA C1 in the formula, Id like to say something like thisp  precodeANDVLOOKUPCURRENT CELL VALUE,LOCATION,3,FALSEltgt,VLOOKUPCURRENT CELL VALUE,LOCATION,3,FALSEltTODAY80 codepre  pMake sense  Anyone know of a way to do this  Otherwise I have to conditionally format each individual cell with the value manually rather than just format all the cells with the same formatting and have the formula check the contents of the cell for what to look for in the location range of the other sheet.p  pAnd to clarify, I know that I can put in the actual cell, such as E3, but then I still have to manually change the formula for each cell which defeats the purpose.  I want to just say current cell or something like that.  I have 3 conditional formats for each cell, I have around 100 cells to be formatted, so rather than having 300 formats I have to put in, Id love to just do 3.  Not sure if this is possible, thats why Im asking p
Negative 29071 pI have been hunting around developer.paypal.com for a couple of days now and have the gist of what I need.  But I am still looking on the best way to accomplish my task.p  pWhat I need is a way for people to pay a fee for an event from my website.  I would prefer to allow Guest Checkout as not all attendees will likely have a paypal account yet.  But what I would really like is for the paypal website to handle all of checkout.  In ebay, you see the total, a small summary and you pay for it right there.  I have looked at express checkout, and it wants to return the user to my website to finalize everything.p  pSo in shortbr Allow guest checkoutbr Show payment total on Paypal webpagebr Allow payment to be finalized and Captured from PayPals website, only coming back to my page to say Thanks.br And if possible, not require an address of the attendee  p  pCan this be done  I have long used StackOverflow for answers, but I am having a hard time finding this answer mainly because I dont know exactly what I am looking for.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 29071 pIve got a simple app that lists some models in a codeNSTableViewcode.p  pThe table is a completely standard viewbased table with a couple of columns, and is populated through an codeNSArrayControllercode using bindings.

The new column is added just fine, but its never populated.p  pI imagine that the basic NSTableColumn instance I create is cellbased, not view based, and thats causing trouble. However, I have no idea how to proceed from here, and the docs never talk about binding columns that have been added programmatically.p  pIn this case, all I want is a simple text column, bound to the model, exactly like the one I can easily set up IB.p  pI could do all this by implementing an codeNSTableViewDataSourcecode and manually feeding the table, but Ive got everything else set up with bindings already.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 29071 pI have a really nasty problem with a CodeIgniter application which I want to load balance using also MySQL replication.p  pIn other PHP frameworks this would be a 5minute job because you may switch the datasource just before saving the data CakePHP allows this, for example, but it seems in CodeIgniter thats a different story. My problem is the application is legacy and I have to load balance it so I have all the hardware setup already done, the filesystem is in sync, the database has a slave and updates it as it should, but I have to make the second CodeIgniter application to read from the slave and write to the master.p  pI already found a solution but since the application is legacy I wouldnt want to go into its internals because I could destroy something that already works its also pretty sensible because people are paying within the app and its also live which makes things even worse.p  pThe solution Ive found is a hrefhttplabs.earthpeople.se201108codeigniteractiverecordsetuptousemasterslavedbreplication relnofollowthis onea which makes you change all the models in the application.  As further information CodeIgniter database driver strongCIDBmysqldriverstrong in this case doesnt have any method for switching the connection or something.p  pstrongDo you have another suggestion for tackling this problemstrong besides changing all the models which I find a bit too intrusivep

No exceptions are thrown. The scroll view even scrolls, albeit the content view is partly offscreen.p  pNo where do I explicitly set the scroll views content size I leave that to the system. The content view has an intrinsic size the content views size appears to be fine its the content views origin that is the problem. p  pThe scroll views content offset is the same before and after dismissing the view controller. However, the displacement of the x component of the content views origin is proportional to the content offset. The greater the content offset, the more negative the x component of the content views origin is after the modal view controller is dismissed. And, at a content offset of zero, the x component is zero. So if the modal view controller is presented while viewing the first page of content when the content offset is zero, the content views frame is correct upon dismissal of the view controller. The contentoffsetofzero case is the only circumstance in which the content views frame correctly reflects its constraints. p  pI have tried inserting calls to layoutIfNeeded in various places with no results.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 29071 pI have a few doubts about how to approach my goal. I have an outside camera who is recording people and I want to draw an ellipse on every person. p  pRight now what I do is get the feature points of the people from the frame I get them using a mask to only have the feature points on the people, set a EM algorithm and train it with my samples the feature points extracted. The number of clusters is twice the number of people from the image I get it before start the EM algorithm using other methods such as pixel counting with a codebook.p  pMy question is a Do I have to just train it only for the first frame and then use predict in the following frames or b use train with the feature points in every frame p  pRight now I am doing the option b I dont use predict because I dont really know how to use the predict.p  pIf I do a, can you help me with it and after that how to draw the ellipses. If I do b, can you help me drawing an ellipse for every person Since right know I got different ellipses for the same person using the cov, mean, etc one for the arm, for example.p  pWhat I want to achieve is this paper using the Gaussian model  a hrefhttpieeexplore.ieee.orgxpllogin.jsptpamparnumber5580105amptag1ampurlhttp3A2F2Fieeexplore.ieee.org2Fxpls2Fabsall.jsp3Farnumber3D558010526tag3D1 relnofollowhttpieeexplore.ieee.orgxpllogin.jsptpamparnumber5580105amptag1ampurlhttp3A2F2Fieeexplore.ieee.org2Fxpls2Fabsall.jsp3Farnumber3D558010526tag3D1ap  pLet me know if I did not express myself correctly.

Negative 29071 pI have a project in which a am using Bison to generate parser. Project itself is build with SCons and all of my code is written in C. One of the things I decided on the beginning was separating code into 3 main diretories includes, src and test, where first one could contain only empublicem headers, emsrcem containing both implementations and emprivateem headers, and emtestem containing just tests.p  pCurrently this convention is broken by 3 files strongstack.hhstrong, strongposition.hhstrong and stronglocation.hhstrong. They are automatically generated by Bison since I use it in a C mode. But, while I could use argument emdefinesincludenamespaceparser.hppem to set where parsers header should be placed I cannot find a way to define where those 3 files should be put, so they are saved in the same folder as emsrcnamespaceparser.cppem.p  pId like to find out how to handle it cleanly. So far I came up with 2 ideas first is to use emdefineem and emapi.locationem to set it to currently used classes which would prevent Bison from generating those files again and then move those files there. The other is to reimplement empositionem and emlocationem classes on my own and set them up with said api. One idea sound to me like a dirty hack while the other as an overkill for such a simple task.p  pIs there any other clean way to make sure that helpers used by parser will be placed in a emincludeem directory while emsrcem will contains only implementationsp  pEDITp  pThe reason why those files or their replacement should be put in public headers folder is that they are being included in strongparser.hppstrong file generated by Bison. As a result I would not be able to compiling any file that includes parser.hpp without adding those files to list of searched folders. Currently I have to add path to source folder to includes, so that compiler can find those 3 files required only in 1 place parser.hpp header that is generated and I have no control over it. It is inconsequent and confusing so I would like to make it right.p

Negative 29071 pI need editable text in an Apache Wicket Application. As the text has to appear very commontablelike, with editing only after the user double clicks on the text and so on, using normal TextFields is not really an option.p  pSo I decided to go for the new HTML5 attribute codecontenteditablecode, which does the overall job quite fine. With the following markup and Java code I get a label that looks like static text, but after the user clicks inside the text is editablep  precodeltdiv wicketidid contenteditablegtltdivgt  ...  item.addnew Labelid, dummy content codepre  pBut now I obviously need to catch some event when the user actually edits the text, as the new text should be stored back into the database.

Negative 29071 pIm trying to display a Bitmap on a form, but the problem is I have to resize it beforehand for it to even fit. Its a large map like an actual map...geographical, so of course if I make it really small just to fit on the form, it wont be readable. So, I figured my only option was to possibly add in some sort of scrolling functionality. That way I could the keep the full size of the image, and still have it contained with my form. I would just have to use vertical and horizontal scroll bars around a specified area of in which I could navigate the entire map. Keep in mind, I do need some room within the form for buttons, checkboxes, etc.p  pI looked around for some information on the subject, and I wasnt really able to find anything besides something on CodeProject. However, it was related to VC and dialogs, and Im using C. p  pAs of now, the only thing I can think of is to make a borderless second window with horizontal and vertical scrolling enabled on creation, size it accordingly, and pin it to my main window. I could then place the Bitmap within entire size of the second window, and it should work like I want it to. Is that even possible Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should dop

Negative 29071 pOverview I am building a CMS using PHP, and I am trying to implement this using MVC. I am trying to extend my code using a hrefhttpr.jemvc2.phps relnofollowthis structurea, as it represents an accurate representation of MVC and it is quite straightforward. To communicate with my database I use Domain Objects and Data Mappers.p  pQuestionsp  ul liIs it really necessary to have a 111 mapping between a model, a view, and a controller li ul  blockquote   pExample For a blog system, when displaying a blog entry page I would create a controller called DisplayEntryController, and a View called DisplayEntryView. The view would get its information from the BlogMapper class which communicates with the DB to retrieve the current blog entry and a CommentMapper class which communicates with the DB to retrieve the comments for the current blog entry. Is this good practice, considering that view works with 2 model objects If not what is the alternative If yes, how can this be implemented in a generic wayp blockquote  ul liCan multiple controllers handle one page For the example above, would it be possible to have a DisplayEntryController and a CommentController handling the relevant parts of a page displaying the blog entry If yes, how would the 2 controllers coordinateli ul  pThank you in advance. Examples will be greatly appreciated.p  hr  pMost PHP MVC implementations Ive seen on the web use the page approach to organise their MVC. E.g. for the Home page, you have one view, one controller and one model. Routing for 111 mapping in MVC is straightforward, as you can enforce the location and naming of your MVC components, and when a request for the Home page comes it automatically looks for the following classes HomeView HomeController and HomeModel.p  pThis obviously doesnt work well in larger projects. How should routing be handled to support routing to multiple models DataMappers, multiple views, without creating an overcomplicated router or adding a complex dependency injection layerp  blockquote   pExample As discussed above, when displaying a blog entry you display   the blog entry code and the comment section. To achieve this, it   communicates with two DataMappers, the one which gets the blog entry,   and the one which returns the comments for the blog. How can the view   be assigned to work with these two datamappers to get the data from   the DBp blockquote

Using the notation m for multiplication, a for addition, and x for no operation as well as a number to indicate the partial sum e.g. m5 means multiplication with the 5th partial sum I can writep  precodeport0  m1  m2  m3  m4  m5  m6  m7  m8  m1  m2  m3  m4  m5  ...  port1   x   x   x   x   x  a1  a2  a3  a4  a5  a6  a7  a8  ... codepre  pSo by using 8 partial sums after nine clock cycles four from the load and five from the multiplication I can submit one AVX load, one AVX addition and one AVX multiplication every clock cycle.p  pstrongI guess this means that its impossible to achieve the maximum throughput for this tasks in 32bit mode in Ivy Bridge and Haswell since 32bit mode only has eight AVX registersstrongp  pstrongEditstrong In regards to the bounty.  My main questions still hold.  I want to get the maximum throughput of either the Ivy Bridge or Haswell functions above, codencode can be any value greater than or equal to 64.  I think this can only be done using unrolling eight times for Ivy Bridge and 10 times for Haswell.  If you think this can be done with another method then lets see it.  In some sense this is a variation of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8389648howtoachieve4flopspercyclehow to achieve 4 FLOPs per cyclea.  But instead of only multiplication and addition Im looking for one 256bit load or two 128bit loads, one AVX multiplication, and one AVX addition every clock cycle with Ivy Bridge or two 256bit loads and two FMA3 instructions per clock cycle.p  pI would also like to know how many registers are necessary.  For Ivy Bridge I think its 10.  One for the broadcast, one for the load only one due to register renaming, and eight for the eight partial sums.  So I dont think this can be done in 32bit mode and indeed when I run in 32bit mode the performance drops significantly.p  pI should point out that the compiler can give misleading results a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21134279differenceinperformancebetweenmsvcandgccforhighlyoptimizedmatrixmultpDifference in performance between MSVC and GCC for highly optimized matrix multplication codeap  pThe current function Im using for Ivy Bridge is below.

I will want it to return a status      and populate a global variable with the data.    void cancel       Cancels and closes driver      is called from with in getData   end codepre  pIm aware that the methods are currently written in C syntax here, Im not sure if that is bad practice or not though at this point. Here is how I intend to call the method. p  precodeDriverOne driver  [[DriverOne alloc] init] driver.getData   codepre  pAm I completely off base here or is this approach correct in what Im trying to achieve  Thanks for any advice or suggestions.p

Negative 29071 pI have a UITextView which displays some notes the user wrote down. There are multiple pages of notes. I added a swipe gesture recognizer to the text view so that it flips to the next page if the user swipes to the left, and previous page if the user swipes to the right. I want to add sliding animations when the user swipes. That is, when the user swipes to the left, the current page slides out to the left and the following page slides in from the right.p  pI saw some other posts saying that codeCATransitioncode can be used for this purpose but looks like there has to be at least two views, but I only have one here the UITextView.

Negative 29071 pHere comes a straightforward question about random access when it comes to file systems using FAT. p  pI have seen different explanations of FAT with different kinds of picturesanimations showing different things. I dont understand how random access is possible without going through the file once. I thought of some kind of table that listed all the blocks that belong to a certain file, but it looks like the FAT is only mapping to the next block, meaning you still have to go through the FAT until you find the EndOfFile, then save these indexes in an array, and only then would you be able to perform random access.p  pMy question is if what I wrote above is true. Is the whole random access only possible after first looking through the table to find all the blocksp

Negative 29071 pTrying to find an approach to perform some regular housekeeping in a Worklight Server. Simplified scenariop  pWe have an adapter talking to a backend system. When user authenticates with Worklight they create some credentials that are passed to the backend on each service call. Those credentials can become stale if not used for a period of time. Hence what we want is a heartbeat for all active sessions. I have a singleton Java object in which I stash the credentials when the user authenticates, what I want to do is have some kind of background worker thread to iterate the list of credentials and make a heartbeat call to the server.p  pI end up with adapter methods like thisp  precode   in business service adapter    businessMethod        make service call using credentials from users Worklight session         in authentication adapter, normal adapter authentication methods and a heartbeat    authentication         get backend credentials         store credentials in users session         stash credentials in singleton        how do we cal this heartbeat every x min   heartbeat         for each credential in singleton stash             make heartbeat call to server keeping credential alive    codepre  pThe question is how do we trigger that heartbeat. Ive tried using a Java TimerTask, which nearly works. I can arrange that the Java TimerTask will call my heartbeat. The problem is that when running under the TimerTask we dont have a normal Worklight Server environment, calls to WL.Server.invokeProcedure throw exceptions, and thinking about this its seems unlikely that I would have access to the normal Worklight APIs from effectively a foreign thread.p  pWe are using Worklight 6.1, deploying  on a WebSphere Liberty server. At present best I can think of is to write some external miniapplication or shell script that periodically calls the heartbeat method.p  pAny better suggestionsp

I have setup a AssemblyInitialize to a class that just contains that static method, and told that method to fire the static methods for ClassInitialize. It of course fires before any constructors. Though the root of the issue is still unresolved as it is not self contained but dependent on a class function to call the class setup.p

Negative 29071 pWhere I work our main web application is served with nginxuwsgiDjango. A given production box has 80 uwsgi worker processes running on it. Our Django application makes moderately frequent requests to Amazon S3 but, if each of those 80 workers has to use its own HTTP connection for such requests, theyre not frequent enough to take advantage of the relatively short HTTP KeepAlive allowed for by Amazons servers. So, we frequently have to pay a reconnection penalty after the connection is dropped on Amazons side.p  pWhat I would like is if there were a proxy service running on the same box that could concentrate the S3 connections from those 80 processes down into a smaller pool of HTTP connections that would get enough use that they would be kept alive. The Django app would connect to the proxy, and the proxy would use its pool of keptalive connections to forward the requests to S3. I see that it is possible to use nginx itself as a forward proxy, but its not clear to me if or how this can take advantage of connection pooling the way I have in mind. An ideal solution would be good at autoscaling so that a uwsgi worker would never have to wait on the proxy itself for a connection, but would pare back connections as load drops so as to keep the connections as hot as possible perhaps keeping 1 or 2 spare to handle occasional upticks.p  pIve run across other forward proxies such as Squid but these products seem designed to fulfill the more traditional caching proxy role for use by e.g. ISPs that have many disparate remote clients.p  pDoes anyone know of an existing solution for this type of problem Many thanksp

Negative 29071 pIm trying to figure out how closures are implemented in JS in theory, and theres one thing that confuses me and I couldnt find an answer to.p  pClosures in JS use a chain of Activation Objects. Each function invocation has one, and it points to its parents Activation Object, which points to emitsem parents Activation Object and so on.p  pIf I understand correctly, the parent in this case is the function call in which the child function was emdefinedem in.p  pBut how does the child know its parents Activation Object The child function could have been called anywhere in the program, even outside of the function call that defined it. Is the Activation Object of the parent somehow stored in the function object itself when the function is defined Does every function invocation somehow get its parents Activation Object from its own function object Thats the only explanation I could think of, but I couldnt verify it.p  pAlso, is there a way to inspect an Activation Object much like how codeprotocode can be inspectedp

In my ngrepeat, I am creating a group by conditionally showing a header row with the category name if it is different that the previous value by using codeitems[index  1]code to check the previous value. This works, but if I apply an orderBy filter, it would seem that index doesnt reflect the new order. What am I doing wrongp

Negative 29071 pIm using Moxy in my Jersey 2.7 project basically just to marshall my objects to JSON when the service issues a response.

Negative 29071 pI am making a java program that classifies a set of latlng coordinates to a specific rectangle of a custom size, so in effect, map the surface of the earth into a custom grid and be able to identify what rectangle polygon a point lies in. p  pThe way to do this I am looking into is by using a map projection possibly Mercator. p  pFor example, assuming I want to classify a longlat into squares of 100m x 100m, p  p44.727549, 10.419704 and 44.727572, 10.420460 would classify to area X p  pand p  p44.732496, 10.528092 and 44.732999, 10.529465 would classify to area Y as they are within 100m apart. this assumes they lie within the same boundary of coursep  pIm not too worried about distortion as I will not need to display the map, but I do need to be able to tell what polygon a set of coordinates belong to. p  pIs this possible Any suggestions welcome. Thanks. p  pstrongEditstrongp  pOmitting projection of the poles is also an acceptable lossp

Negative 29071 pI am in the process of designing a checkbook register application, for my own personal project and use.  I am running into some design decision stumbling blocks, which I would like some input for.p  pFirst, I initially thought of creating one whole class to input the register entries into the database which stores everything.  However, upon further reflection I was thinking that maybe the withdrawal and deposit functionality of the application should be in different classes On the basis that a class should only house 1 responsibility.  When I wrote this out on paper, I found that the two classes withdrawal and deposit would have similar functionality and in my mind should be in the same class.p  pI am going to develop this application in C.  What are other options or just thoughts on what I should do  Should it be in one class, or should it be dealt with multiple classesp

Ill startp  ol liThe traditional application server approach a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgjetty relnofollowJettya, a hrefhttptomcat.apache.org relnofollowTomcata, etc. ul liAssemble software into codewarcode files and craft your own provisioning and deployment script, e.g., using a hrefhttpizpack.org relnofollowizpacka, a hrefhttpsant.apache.org relnofollowant scriptsa, a hrefhttpcargo.codehaus.org relnofollowcargoa or something similar.br nbspli ulli liRely on integration platforms, e.g., a hrefhttpfabric8.io relnofollowfabric8a, a hrefhttpservicemix.apache.org relnofollowservicemixa, a hrefhttpwww.jboss.orgproductsfuseoverview relnofollowfusea, etc. ul liSeems like a nice opinionated approach. If not already using one of these, apart from a lockin, rerolling an application into this format requires a bit of work. Isnt the trend to move away from large frameworksbr nbspli ulli liBundle application codewarcode files into codeearcode Enterprise archives files ul liRequires a fullfledged java EE server, e.g., a hrefhttpwildfly.org relnofollowwildflya, a hrefhttpsglassfish.java.net relnofollowglassfisha etc. Unless the capabilities of such server is needed it adds a lot of overhead to what a ziparchive could do already.br nbspli ulli liVirtual machines a hrefhttpwww.vagrantup.com relnofollowVagranta, a hrefhttpswww.docker.com relnofollowDockera, etc.  ul liDocker is nice but on a windows host needs to be run in a VM anyway. VMs vagrant or not incurs a performance overhead and tends to rely on complex provisioning tools such as a hrefhttppuppetlabs.com relnofollowpuppeta or a hrefhttpwww.saltstack.comcommunity relnofollowsalta.br nbspli ulli liRunnable jars, e.g., a hrefhttpsgithub.compuniversecapsule relnofollowCapsulea, a hrefhttpmaven.apache.orgpluginsmavenshadeplugin relnofollowmaven shade plugina, a hrefhttponejar.sourceforge.net relnofollowOneJARa.  ul lia hrefhttpsgithub.compuniversecapsule relnofollowCapsulea seems great, its like an executable, selfextracting zip file, which also runs the application. With an embedded jetty multiple traditional codewarcode files can be served from one executable. li ulli ol  pThe first option has been my reference approach for long but requires a lot of provisioning, install scripts, both which varies on different environments e.g., Linux, Windows. p  pWhat modern alternatives are out there that makes packaging and deployment easier p  psup1 Picture a SOA like setup with microservices, RESTful communication etc. supbr sup2 With that in mind lets rule out codePaaScode providers such as cloudbees, cloudfoundy etc. They deserve a topic of their own. sup p

Negative 29071 pI am creating a set of forms with ngrepeat, each form has a checkboxmight change to radio if that matters and I am trying to manipulate the specific level that is checked.

Is this to be expected p  pI was hoping to improve results by converting all AJAX calls to REST but the speed Im seeing is discouraging. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBpbXd.png altenter image description herep

Negative 29071 pIm attempting to upgrade my website to the newest, or at least a newer, version of PHP.  Through out my site I receive Internal Server Error messages.  Some are consistent and occur every time you access a page.  Others are intermittent even though the same actions were taken.  I am trying to solve at least one of the errors in hopes of gaining a foothold in solving all the rest.p  pCode that consistently produces the Internal Server Errorp  precodetry      global dbCon     stmt  dbCongtprepareSELECT pdftemplate, aitemplate, idtemplate, imgtemplate FROM products WHERE skus     stmtgtexecutearrays gt sku            Failure occurs on this line     result  stmtgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC      This is never reached      stmtgtbindValuesku,sku,PDOPARAMSTRAttempted alternate form of binding     stmtgtexecute                            Alternate binding still failed here   catch PDOException e      loggergtwarnDatabase call failed, was unable to gather product templates, pricing modal, sku sku  codepre  pAs you can see by my comment, the line codestmtgtexecutearrays gt skucode is consistently the culprit.  If it is commented out, page still loads.  More specifically, if I put codestmtgtexecutecode the statement executes and the page still loads minus DB required content of course. So it seems that during PHPs attempt to bind the variables to the prepared statement there is a failure.  This also applies to codebindValuecode. Anytime a value is bound previously execute fails.p  pI have tried many ways to get some type of output in the logs.  For example at the top of the pagep  precodeerrorreportingEALL iniset displayerrors,1 inisetlogerrors, 1 iniseterrorlog, tmpphperror.log errorlog Hello, errors  codepre  pIn the .htaccessp  precodephpflag  logerrors on phpvalue errorlog  tmpphperror.log codepre  pI have tried various permutations of the previous code trying to produce an error in the log file.  Yes, some of it is redundant, I was getting desperate for an answer.  Yes, Hello, errors does appear in the log file.p  pThe cause of all of this  Website works wonderfully on PHP 5.3.  It is the version it was developed in.  I know, should of developed it on the newer version.  I have logistic reasons that were previously out of my control When I bump the version up to 5.4 or 5.5 I get the internal server error.

Negative 29071 pI have a program that is intensive in CRUD operations on a SQL Server Express 2012 database. I was hoping to create a CLR assembly that contained most of the code and then attach it to the database so that it would stay on the server. I was hoping to have resourceintensive calculations performed on each row in a specific table and then the results from this calculation will be entered into a column not involved in the calculation itself in that table. I wanted this to stay on the server so that the server could automatically do the calculations without the frontend application having to call it, and without the application having to submit TSQL back and forth from the server.

Negative 29071 pIm working on a multithreaded application that uses the SQLAlchemy ORM. It already uses scopedsession with the thread as its scope, but we are having some issues when we pass an ORM object from a worker thread back to the main thread.

Negative 29071 pWe are working on a windows application which caters to an engineering calculation which are essentially very long running. So we are basically trying to keep the calculation module separate and working in a separate worker thread and pass it an Action delegate in method signature which will be invoked to report the calculation progress in the UI. The delegate handler declared in the UI will be updating the UI. We found that while a huge loop is running in the calculation, the UI is not showing the periodic progress and only displaying the final result. If a Thread Sleep for 1 millisecond is introduced in the calculation loop, the UI is getting updated correctly. This is not expected behavior as we are executing the calculation using a separate Task and updating the UI using BeginInvoke calls.p  pI have created a simple application to demonstrate our approach and code so that it is easier to understand.

Negative 29071 pIm looking for an easy way on some of my flows to be able to log when some event occurs.br In my simple case an event might be whenever any message flows down a channel, or whenever a certain  of messages flow down a channel, Id like to print out some info to a log file.  p  pI know there currently is a codeloggingchanneladaptercode but in the case just described Id need to be able to tailor my own log message and Id also need to have some sort of counter or metrics keeping track of things so the codeexpressioncode on the adapter wouldnt suffice since that grants access to the codepayloadcode but not info about the channel or flow.  p  pIm aware that Spring Integration already exposes a lot of metrics to JMX via codeManagedResourcescode and codeMetricTypecode and codeManagedMetriccodes. Ive also watched Russells Managing and Monitoring Spring Integration Applications YouTube video several times a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvTetfR7ULnA8 relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvTetfR7ULnA8abr and I realize that Spring Integration component metrics can be polled via codejmxattributepollingchanneladaptercodep  pThere are certainly many ways to get what Im after.  A few examples  p  ul liServiceAdapter that has a counter in it that also has a reference to a loggerli liHook into the advicechain of a pollerli liPoll JMX via jmxattributepollingchanneladapterli ul  pIt might be useful however to offer a few components that users could put stronginto the middle of a flowstrong that could provide some basic functionality to easily satisfy the usecase I described.br Sample flow might look likebr codeinboundchanneladapter gt  metricloggingchannelinterceptor gt componentY gt outboundchanneladaptercodep  pVery highlevel such a component might look like a hybrid of the codeloggingchanneladaptercode and a codeChannelInterceptorcode with a few additional fields  p  precode    ltintmetricloggingchannelinterceptorgt         id         order          phase         autostartup         ref         method         channel         outchannel         logtriggerexpressionSendCount  10  0         level         loggername         logfullmessage         expression           gt codepre  pInternally the class implementing that would need to keep a few basic stats, I think the ones exposed on messageChannel would be a good  i.e. SendCount, MaxSendDuration, etc.  The codelogtriggerexpressioncode and codeexpressioncode attributes would need access to the internal counters as well.p  pPlease let me know if there is something that already does what Im describing or if Im overcomplicating this.  If it does not currently exist though I think that being able to quickly drop a component into a flow without having to write a custom codeServiceActivatorcode just for logging purposes provides benefit.p

So here is my situation Im creating a simple game in HTML using JS and CSS. All you have to do is to find 6 differences between two images.

Negative 29071 pIm trying to write a single page app which will persist the current users into a database tableHSQL and also a list of storiesjust 1 liners into a separate table in same DBp  pI have 2 POJOs, User and Story. Then 2 dtos, 2 repositories etc but am struggling to figure out how to persist these to 2 tables...p  pBasically I need to know whether I need 2 persistenceunits and 2 entityManagerFactorys , even though I wish to write to a single database, but to 2 tables...as seems to be the case from looking around but part of the problem is that I am very confused with some of the lingo.p  pThere are many questions regarding multiple tables, but they always seem to be in different data sources. In this context are data sources simply tables Ie persisting to same database but different tables aka data sources  If not, are datasource and database interchangeable in this contextp  pThanks.p
Negative 29071 pIve been recently assigned on a project using Teradata. Ive been told to strictly use DROPCREATE instead of DELETE ALL, because the latter leaves some space allocated someway. This is counterintuitive to me, and I think its probably wrong. I searched the web for a comparison between the two methods, but I found nothing. This only reinforces my belief that DELETE ALL doesnt suffer from the issue above. However, if this is the case, I must prove it both practically and theoretically.p  pSo, my question is is there a difference in space allocation between the two methods If not, is there an official document user guide, technical specification, whatever else that proves itp  pThank youp
Negative 29071 pIn a hrefhttplunrjs.com relnofollowlunr.jsa, you can add a unique reference using the code.refcode method but I cant find any method to add extra datainfo about that particular record.

Negative 29071 pI am experiencing a quite weird issue on my clients MyBB instance. Attachments upload works, but I cant see them when readin the thread after saving the modifications. p  pAt first I thought it was a permission issue chmod or htaccess, but the upload works. I can see uploaded attachments in the uploads201503 folder. I see one thumbnail file and another one with the .attach file extension, which is in fact my jpg image when renaming the .attach extension to .jpg. So upload works.p  pNow looking at the database attachments table, I can see the uploaded attachment row. The attachname field shows 201503post214252719788162c40a2a603edc2b441bd78460f9a7.attach, which is exactly the my uploaded attachment. So, persistence to database works.p  pI tried removing all my htaccess files and putting chmod to 777... negative. Its not going anywhere.p  pDoes anybody here already faced that issue p  pI have searched the forum before posting.. some very old threads have showed up, but unfortunately the op did not post the solution.p  pI got no errorwarning message whatsoever.p  pMany thanks for help.p  pCharlesp

Negative 29071 pI have an exe that is run by nonadmin users and therefore cant be installed to CProgram Files. However, I also dont really want it to be installed to AppData because a some antimalware apps flag it immediately for being there, b some cleaning tools will delete it from there, and c most users have a negative stigma about exes being there.p  pAs my exe is used by limited users, Ive seen that InnoSetup will allow me to present CMyAppFolder as the default presented folder. If the limited user accepts this path, Windows actually lets the app install there  contrary to reports Ive seen that claim that nonadmin users cant write to the C drivep  pI even tested this myself on my limited Win7 setup, and I can indeed use InnoSetup to install to CMyAppFolder but not to the root of C itself.p  pDo you think theres anything wrong with presenting not forcing a default install path of CMyAppFolder for limited users, based on all the above facts The user can always change the folder manually, but Im assuming most will just click Next and install there.p  pThanks in advance for anything I may have overlooked.p

Negative 29071 pI am looking to create a method that will be able to strongupdatestrong any table in a database, given any number of columns to update as well as any number of fields to look up for in where clause. The problem is that i cannot find a design pattern of such function that will be able to do that. How am i gonna send the parameters It looks like im going to need two params[] which is not possible and sending the query string itself is out of the question. The method should be able to process any query like thisp  precodeUPDATE [Table] SET [Col1]  1, [Col2]  2, ... WHERE [Col10]  1 AND [Col11]  2, ... codepre  pAs an example for a generic Insert method i have used multiple overloads of the same function with different object type as its parameter.p  precodepublic void InsertBroadcast obj... public void InsertComments obj... public void InsertSeated obj... codepre  pNow this is simple since depending on the type of object, i am inserting into the respective database table the values taken from the object obj. Cant figure out one for an update.p
Negative 29071 pWe currently use Mandrill to send our emails and this is working OK.p  pNow we wish to capture Mandrill webhooks back into our server and annotate the appropriate email source record with the event information.  In order to do this we believe we have to pass the ID of the original message to the webhook so that we can pull up that message from our server when the webhook arrives.p  pWe believe the correct approach is to add a Mandrill metadata field to the message, but were having trouble doing that.p  pWeve tried the following with variationsp  precodeMessage.Headers.AddXMCMETADATA, OriginId   Id   codepre  pbut the OriginId is never returned in the webhook and we dont see this header in the emails source.

Negative 29071 pLets say that I have 200 expensive method calls to make each with different arguments. For some reason, I can execute 5 of those calls in parallel, but no more.

Ive played around with code samples, read some of the documentation, and I think I have a rough understanding of it.

Negative 29071 pIn C Ive four binary numbers stored in four codestringscode, lets say codestring s11010, s21011, s30100, s40011code OR directly stored as codeintcodes codeint i110, i211, i34, i43code.p  pI dont know which situation will lead to the better solution, thats why I wanted to clarify, that I can start with both.p  pNow what I want to do is as follows. Convert the above values to hex values and store them digit wise in one string codestring hexresultAB43code as code101010Acode, code101111Bcode, code010044code, code001133code.

Negative 29071 pIm sure theres a well documented way to do this in Laravel, Im just missing it or not understanding what Im reading.

The problem is if the user bookmarks a page, such as codefirststepscode, when the project moves on to stage 2, the user can still access the stage 1 pages. I want to be able to have a method that runs before the one indicated by the route that makes sure that they are visiting the correct URL for the stage the job is in, redirect if necessary and then store the job an eloquent object in the class or inject it to the method called. p  pIve tried creating a codebeforecode method in the controller but it doesnt get calledp  precodepublic function beforeRequest request, token      thisgtwebsite  Websitewhereaccesstoken, , tokengtfirstOrFail  codepre  pAs you can see in the router I have a custom middleware that validates the token.

Negative 29071 pPHP has only one thread so that means it can perform 1 command at a time, while node.js has the non blocking future the event loop so it can perform asynchronous functions.p  pI dont see how this is useful. For example  if a user performs a form registration with a codePOSTcode request and we need to insert that data to the database, both Node and PHP need to complete the operation and only then return the response to the user.p  pIf we want to get data from the server, both Node and PHP will query data from the database, wait until the data retrieval is finished and then return the answer to the user. That means the client needs to wait anyway.p  pSo of what benefit is the non blocking futurep

Negative 29071 pI have my web page setup to use a new management system, but would also like to use some basic html pages for other content such as images or whatever, and I seem to remember from years ago that there was a way to use PHP to load HTML pages that are not formatted into a content area, which I assume are DIVs.p  pI also seem to remember that I didnt have to create an if statement, but Im not sure and quite honestly Im awfully confused about how to do this. A friend used to do this coding for me way back when, so the way it was setup was that all I had to do was tell my navigation where to find the file and it would load it inside of my index.php file. p  pHopefully my question is clear, but if not, my website is a hrefhttpdbzfinalcut.com relnofollowright herea, and I just want my HTML files to load into the are with the content image, but only the grey portion which I do have a DIV set up for.

What ends up working is to include this in the apps build.gradle filep  precodedependencies      compile com.android.supportappcompatv722.0.0     compile com.google.android.gmsplayservices7.5.0       compile fileTreedir libs, include [.jar]     compile org.altbeaconandroidbeaconlibrary2.3.5     compile commonscodeccommonscodec1.10       compile projectmyLibrary  codepre  pWhy do I need to include dependencies in both the .aar and the final application What am I not understanding about how dependencies work Why isnt the final application able to grab the .aars dependencies from maven or jCenter at build timep

Negative 29071 pWe are using postgres in a multi tenant nodejs set up. Each client has a separate database and a separate node process. Connection pooling is implemented for each tenant using nodepostgres module. Because of the increasing number of databases, we are soon hitting the maxconnections limit of postgres. increasing maxconnections indefinitely is not an option due to connection overheads. Should there be a change in the architecture for large number of databases Any pointers would be appreciated.p

Negative 29071 pIn my application i have used Retrofit for uploading files to server. Now i want to show the percentage of file upload in progress bar.

Negative 29071 pIm using pyside and sqlalchemy for a database of contact information.p  pThe setup of sqlalchemy is pretty standard, except for the fact that when I created the session using sessionmaker, I set codeexpireoncommit  Falsecode.p  pIn order to be able to create a new session within a sitting Im using a sort of refresh button. The problem is every time I use the refresh button, when I try to add a new lineentry, I get 2 or 4 additional entries with one click, whereas if one gets deleted, all the copies are deleted too they arent actual copies though because each of them has their own unique id.p  precodedef refreshself      self.session.closeall     self.session  CreateSessionself.username, self.password custom method defined elsewhere for creating a session      self.TableViews initializing the table views for pyside      self.WidgetsToAttributes connect widgets of the gui to the sqlalchemy scheme attributes      self.connectSignals connects the qt signals to the appropriate functions in code      pass codepre  pthere are also some additional initializations but they are irrelevant here because they only initialize some widgetsp  pAll the above functions are used in other places, for example for the first initialization of the GUI, so what doesnt work here is the combination of the methods. From what I gather, its the codeconnectSignalscode method that causes all the trouble. Signals are apparently doubled sometimes quadrupled which results in several entries execution of code from one click.p  pWhat causes that and how can I avoid itp

Negative 29071 pSay I have a student table with the following fields  student id, student name, age, gender, marks, class.Assume that due to some error, there are multiple entries corresponding to each student. My requirement is to identify the duplicate rows in the table and the filter criterion is the student name and the class.But in the query result, in addition to identifying the duplicate records, I also need to find the original student detail which got duplicated. Is there any method to do this.

Negative 29071 pSo I am incredibly new to MySQL and I am struggling every step of the way to learning it.  I am supposed to create a small database that can be about anything for my class assignment.  I have the tables created but I am trying to figure out how to correctly JOIN them together. p  pHere is the code I currently have for itp  precodeCREATE TABLE monster    monsterid INTEGER NULL AUTOINCREMENT DEFAULT NULL,   name VARCHAR30 NULL DEFAULT NULL,   hitpoints TINYINT NULL DEFAULT NULL,   armorclass TINYINT NULL DEFAULT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY monsterid   CREATE TABLE monstersize    monsterid INTEGER NULL AUTOINCREMENT DEFAULT NULL,   sizeid INTEGER NULL DEFAULT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY monsterid   CREATE TABLE size    sizeid INTEGER NULL AUTOINCREMENT DEFAULT NULL,   size VARCHAR15 NULL DEFAULT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY sizeid   ALTER TABLE monstersize ADD FOREIGN KEY monsterid REFERENCES monster monsterid ALTER TABLE monstersize ADD FOREIGN KEY sizeid REFERENCES size sizeid    Here is where I am trying to get the joining to happen        SELECT name,hitpoints,size FROM monster m  JOIN size s ON m.monsterids.sizeid JOIN monstersize ms ON s.sizeidms.sizeid codepre
Negative 29071 pI am using csssprites on a few pages of a website as navigation buttons, with a part of the image darkening when hovered over. All these buttons have text on them. Before I had just written the text onto the image and things worked fine, but I wanted to add the text to my html so that it renders better for anyone that zooms in to the page. Doing this however has now caused the images for the sprites not to appear in Firefox, Chrome and IE still works fine in Safari. p  pObviously I assumed that adding the text to the code had caused this but now even when I remove the text, the images still dont show up. Im really having trouble figuring out why this is, especially as I have 2 other pages that use sprites and they are still working fine. The only difference is that i hadnt attempted to move the text into my code on those pages.p  pAny suggestions are really appreciatedp  pCode for the broken spritesp  precode.row5  width 940px height 220px position absolute left 10px top 1215px   .box1  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox1sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px   .boxtext  fontfamily elron color rgba255,255,255,1.00 fontsize 18px width 306px height 18px position absolute top 175px left 0px textalign center   .box1hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   .box2  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox2sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px left 317px   .box2hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   .box3  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox3sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px left 634px   .box3hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   .row6  width 940px height 220px position absolute left 10px top 1425px   .box4  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox4sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px   .box4hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   .box5  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox5sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px left 317px   .box5hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   .box6  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox6sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px left 634px   .box6hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   ltdiv classrow5gt     lta hrefhttpwww.sungblue.comweddings.htmlgt         ltdiv classbox1gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtWEDDINGSltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt     lta hrefhttpwww.sungblue.comprewedding.htmlgt         ltdiv classbox2gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtENGAGEMENT SHOOTSltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt     lta hrefhttpwww.sungblue.comcontact.htmlgt         ltdiv classbox3gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtCONTACTltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt ltdivgt ltdiv classrow6gt     lta hrefhttpsungbluephotography.zenfolio.comgt         ltdiv classbox4gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtCLIENT AREAltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt     lta hrefhttpwww.sungblue.comprices.htmlgt         ltdiv classbox5gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtPRICINGltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt     lta hrefhttpsungbluephotography.zenfolio.combloggt         ltdiv classbox6gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtBLOGltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd heres the code from my other page where my sprites are workingp  precode.row3  width 940px height 288px position absolute left 10px top 335px textalign center   .box1  backgroundimage urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesweddingbox1sprite.jpg width 465px height 288px position absolute top 0px left 0px   .boxtext  width 465px height 18px position absolute left 0px top 260px fontfamily elron fontsize 18px color rgba255,255,255,1.00 textalign center   .box1hover  backgroundposition 0 289px   .box2  backgroundimage urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesweddingbox2sprite.jpg width 465px height 288px position absolute top 0px left 475px   .box2hover  backgroundposition 0 289px   .row4  width 940px height 288px position absolute left 10px top 633px textalign center   .box3  backgroundimage urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesweddingbox3sprite.jpg width 465px height 288px position absolute top 0px left 0px   .box3hover  backgroundposition 0 289px   .box4  backgroundimage urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesweddingbox4sprite.jpg width 465px height 288px position absolute top 0px left 475px   .box4hover  backgroundposition 0 289px  codepre
Negative 29071 pIm adding multiple polygons to a Mapbox map usingp  precodeL.polygonpolyPoints, polyOptions.addTofeatureGroup codepre  pWhats the easiest way to add labels to each polygonp
Negative 29071 pI have a JSON object codetblscode which contains an array called codesectionscode. This array contains titles codencode and IDs codeviewidcode of rooms that are also a part of the JSON object. This means you can do codetbls.[roomid]code and get the array that contains the objects of each room. I have a hard time making this work in Angular.p  pIt was built this way because it makes it easy to work with when it comes to UITableViews in iOS where its implemented and works. Therefore I cannot change the data. I tried below solution, but that gives me an error. Is there an effective way to do this in Angularp  precodelttbody datangrepeatsection in tbls.sectionsgt     lttrgt         lttdgtsection.nlttdgt     lttrgt      lttr datangrepeattable in tbls.section.viewidgt         lttdgttable.nlttdgt     lttrgt lttbodygt codepre  pJSON JSFiddle a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netLu2ocqku relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netLu2ocqkua Edit removed tableObj as its not relevant to the question and doesnt match data example exactly.
