Positive 2827 pI have an iOS app which uses the VOIP property in iOS to have the socket connection maintained in the background. The app is not actually VOIP but I have used the property so that the socket connection is not killed when app is suspended. This worked just fine in iOS8. But while testing with iOS9, I can see that the socket gets killed a few min after the app is minimized and the device is locked.br If the device is not locked ie. I minimize my app and keep using the device, the socket connection is not killed. Have anyone faced such an issue. Is there any extra configuration required for VOIP apps in iOS9 Appreciate any help on this.p

Negative 2827 pIm working with my ASP.NET development team to try and create better i.e. cleaner HTML when rendering pages.  At the moment, .NET has a nasty tendency to do things like dump JavaScript into the page, making it a mandatory requirement on form controls and not allowing forms to work when JS isnt available.  In some instances, were struggling to overcome this without having to add a notable chunk to development time estimates.p  pIve worked with MVC before  via Struts in Java  and found that in that instance, I was able to keep HTML pages exactly as Id wanted them to be. emThis viewpoint is based on the best case static HTML I typically developed beforehand, then handed over to the Java programmers to fill in the holes.emp  pThis worked out really well and we were able to produce some of the best web pages from a CMS that Ive seen.  Could .NET MVC give me the separation I need, or would it be a false economy to put aside valuable development time to test thisp  pIf .NET MVC isnt going to give me this finegrained control over separation, any recommendations for .NET coding practices, libraries, etc. which might would be really helpful.p

Negative 2827 pIve often wondered, if I load a compressed image file, edit it and the save it again, will it loose some quality What if I use the same quality grade when saving, will the algorithms somehow detect that the file has already be compressed as a JPEG and therefore there is no point trying to compress the displayed representation againp  pWould it be a better idea to always keep the original say, a PSD and always make changes to it and then save it as a JPEG or whatever I needp

Negative 2827 pThe AS3 getBounds function returns a rectangle that is not fitting tightly to a rotated ellipse. Instead it returns an axisaligned rectangle based on the bounds of a rectangle whose widthheight corresponds to the maxmin diameter of the ellipse and follows its rotation.p  pThe answer to a similar question on Stack Overflow elegantly outlines the math part of my questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions87734howdoyoucalculatetheaxisalignedboundingboxofanellipseStack Overflow QA about the math of ellipses and bounding boxesap  pBased on this I took a stab at coding a solution in AS3. So far I have been able to produce a rectangle that fits perfectly along the xaxis, but as I rotate my ellipse it acts very weird along the yaxis. Rather than alternating between 2rmin and 2rmax while rotating, it alternates between 2rmin and 0. My best guess is that I have done something wrong when solving the differentiated t for gradient  infinity...p  pHere is an example from my codep  precodevar rmaxuint  45 var rminuint  20 var rotNumber  ellipse.rotation  Math.PI  180 var tnilNumber  Math.atan rmin  Math.tanrot  rmax var tinfNumber  Math.atanrmin  Math.atanrot  rmax  Math.PI  2 var xNumber  rmax  Math.costnil  Math.cosrot  rmin  Math.sintnil  Math.sinrot var yNumber  rmin  Math.sintinf  Math.cosrot  rmax  Math.costinf  Math.sinrot codepre

Negative 2827 pDo you have any insights into the most elegant way of persisting objects from a dynamic language in a document databasep  pI have a solid background in C and have just started programming in Python. At the same time I am trying to learn the ropes of MongoDB. p  pNow I am wondering what is the most elegant way to persist my data to the MongoDB database I have considered several approachesp  ol lipMake all my Python classes able to create a graph of dictionaries and lists representing their state. Moreover, make them able to initialize their state from such a graph. When I want to persist an object, I will ask it for its graph representation and persist that. When I want to get an object, I will retrieve a document graph and provide this to the codeinitcode method of my class. pli lipCreate a separate Mapper class capable of inspecting a given object and creating a graph of dictionaries and lists, which I may then store in MongoDB. The mapper would also be responsible for creating objects whose data has been retrieved from the database. pli lipI tried out a hrefhttppypi.python.orgpypimongoengine0.2.2 relnofollowmongoenginea, a documentobject mapper. However, I was disappointed when it forced me to derive my classes from a particular class Document. It reminded me of Microsofts Entity Framework 1.0 and the lack of POCO support. I dont want to be forced to derive from a particular class. It doesnt feel right, but I am unsure whether this is really a problem in a dynamic language.pli ol  pIs my thinking being hindered by my background in C I am sure I havent grokked the extent of the flexibility that a dynamic language provides, so any advice or hints at best practices would be greatly appreciated.p  pThank you.p

Negative 2827 pSo Im writing yet another Twisted based daemon.  Itll have an xmlrpc interface as usual so I can easily communicate with it and have other processes interchange data with it as needed.p  pThis daemon needs to access a database.  Weve been using SQL Alchemy in place of hard coding SQL strings for our latest projects  those mostly done for web apps in Pylons.p  pWed like to do the same for this app and reuse library code that makes use of SQL Alchemy.  So what to do  Well of course since that library was written for use in a Pylons app its all the straightforward blocking style code that everyone is accustomed to and all of the nonblocking is magically handled by Pylons via threading, thread locals, scoped sessions and so on.p  pSo now for Twisted I guess Im a bit stuck.  I couldp  ol liJust write the sql I need directly if its minimal and use the dbapi pool in twisted to do runInteractions etc when I need to hit the db.li liUse the objects and inherently blocking methods in our library and block now and then in my Twisted daemon. Bah.li liUse sAsync which was last updated in 2008 and kind of reuse the models we have defined already but not really and this doesnt address that the library code needs to work in Pylons too. Does that even work with the latest version SQL Alchemy  Who knows. That project looked great though  why was it apparently abandoned  li liSpawn a separate subprocess and have it deal with the library code and all its blocking, the results being returned back to my daemon when ready as objects marshalled via YAML over xmlrpc.li liUse deferToThread and then expunge the objects returned having made sure to do eager loads so that I have all my stuff that I might need.  Seems kind of ugha to me.li ol  pIm also stuck using Python 2.5.4 atm so no 2.6 yet and I dont think I can just do an import from future to get access to the cool new multiprocessing module stuff in there. Thats OK though I guess as weve got dealing with interprocess communication down pretty well.p  pSo Im leaning towards option 4 mostly as that would avoid the mortal sin of logic  duplication with option 1 while also staying the heck away from threads.  p  pMy first attempt though will be option 2 to just get the thing going and then separate out the calls to the library code perhaps into a separate process if it looks like theres a good chance that something might take a bit too long to block on.  Sad.  Maybe a combination of Stackless Python and Twisted would be interesting here.p  pAny better ideasp

Put 121200Z, and its no more in the results.p  pSo, I guess my question is, is that a bug in WSS 3.0, or am I doing something wrong If so, how can I do to correct this BTW, I want to keep my stored times in UTC and cannot control what users do with their sites settings. Is there a way to retrieve the locale used by the site using web servicesp  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4265766isthereawaytogetasharepointsiteslocalewithwebservicesIs there a way to get a Sharepoint sites locale with web servicesa for the solution.p

Negative 2827 pI have a project that I got from someone else. I dont know how exactly they configured it. All I know is that MyEclipse thinks the project has Spring and Hibernate capabilities but not Hibernate 3, which is required for reverse engineering to output Spring DAOs. Therefore the option to create Spring DAOs is grayed out, when in reality the project does use Hibernate 3. p  pstrongIs there some way to trick or force MyEclipse into reverse engineering the tables and creating Spring DAOs, or just to convince it that it is indeed using Hibernate 3, which would allow normal reverse engineeringstrong I want to avoid remaking the project.p  pIf there is some other convenient way to reverse engineer them and bring them into the project, I would be perfectly happy with that, as long as it ouput something that MyEclipse could understand. I am new to this area, so I really only know how to use MyEclipse for the reverse engineering at this point.p
Negative 2827 pim developing a multiplatform C fuzzing application. The app spawns a child process and checks whether it stopped unexpectedly. Ive already managed to do this on linux, however, windows exception handling mechanism is making things hard for me. p  pMy code right now does the following  Call CreateProcess to spawn the process.  WaitForSingleObject to wait for it to terminate.  Then call GetExitCodeProcess and check if the exit code corresponds to an exception.p  pEverything works as it should, ive tested it with a null dereferencing test application, and i can catch the exception gracefully. However, each time i test this, a Windows error message box spawns telling me to Send or Not Send the error report. Since the fuzzer is supposed to be an automatic testing application, id need to somehow disable this notification, so that even if an exception is caught, the fuzzer can continue testing.p  pIve already tried installing a SEH handler, but had no luckapparently these handlers arent inherited by child processes. Ive read something about using vectored exception handling, but suppose it would be the same, i believe vector handlers arent inherited. p  pCould anybody help me with this problem I dont know what to search for, ive already googled a lot and havent found anyhing. p  pThanksp

Negative 2827 pstrongEDIT After spending several hours researching this, I dont think Im going to find anything that will actually end up saving me time compared to the amount of time and effort of finding suitable language, suitable bindings, and maintaining that environment in the face of change on all these platforms.  Im accepting the answer that seems most realistic because it would be the best idea for most people.  The opinion Im drawing from these conversations and others Im having is that the only true way forward is to either use a Functional language that can operate without external bindings, or something that has bindings maintained by a commercial entity such as F.  Its too much work and too little demand and the state of whats available in the wild reflects that.  I hope it changes one day.strongp  pId like to start using a functional language in my software, strongin addition tostrong ObjectiveC which is my primary language C may be workable as the binding.  Must be crossplatform, meaning Windows, Linux, OSX x86, and iOS ARM.  What should I use and how can I achieve thisp  pIm planning to switch to LLVM backend and Clang for my ObjectiveC soon, if this makes any difference.  p  pI dont have any knowledge investment in any functional language, although Ive screwed around with a few.  Im learning one from scratch so I want to learn something nonarcane if possiblep  ul liThe solution must be strongrealstrong, theres a lot of preliminary or prototype work done but..li liIm using objective C and I really do need Cocoa bindings because a large amount of my data is using Cocoa types so things would be a mess otherwise.

Negative 2827 pIm trying to automate the download of a file from a website. Normally to download the file, I login with a username and password. Navigate to a particular screen then click a button.p  pIve been trying to watch the sequence of POSTs using Chromes developer mode, and then replicate all the steps using .Net WebClient class, but to no success. Ive derived from the WebClient class and added cookie handling. Which seems to be working. I go to the login page and post using WebClient.UploadValues. About half the times it seems to work. The next step appears to make another POST action to a reporting URL. Once again I use WebClient.UploadValues, but the response from the server is a page showing an internal error.p  pI have a couple of questions. 1 Are there better tools than hand coding C code to replicate a bunch of web browser interactions I really only care about being able to download the file at a particular time each day onto a Windows box. 2 The WebClient does not seem to be the best class to use for this. Perhaps its a bit to simplistic. I tried using HttpWebRequest, but it has no facilities for encoding POST requests. Any other recommendations 3 Although Chromes developer plugin appears to show all interaction, I find it a bit cumbersome to use. Id be interested in seeing all of the raw communication unencrypted though, the site is only accesses via https, so I can see if Im really replicating all of the steps.p  pI can even post the exact code Im using. The site Im pulling data from, specifically is the Standard and Poors website. They have the ability to create custom reports for downloading historical data which I need for reporting, not republishing.p

You can make Rails rescue errors and render error pages on a  perscenario basis by tagging a scenario or feature with the allowrescue tag.   If you set this to true, Rails will rescue all errors and render error  pages, more or less in the same way your application would behave in the  default production environment. Its not recommended to do this for all  of your scenarios, as this makes it hard to discover errors in your application. ActionControllerBase.allowrescue  false   If you set this to true, each scenario will run in a database transaction.  You can still turn off transactions on a perscenario basis, simply tagging   a feature or scenario with the notxn tag. If you are using Capybara,  tagging with culerity or javascript will also turn transactions off.   If you set this to false, transactions will be off for all scenarios,  regardless of whether you use notxn or not.   Beware that turning transactions off will leave data in your database   after each scenario, which can lead to hardtodebug failures in   subsequent scenarios.

Negative 2827 pI have a codeUIScrollViewcode and a codeUITapGestureRecognizercodewhich are both pretty basic, and have got them to work together in every way I need except one. The codeUIScrollViewcode doesnt use any zooming, and the codeUITapGestureRecognizercode just writes to the console for now. p  pI can get the codeUITapGestureRecognizercode to write to the console when the codeUIScrollViewcode is tapped, either while stationary or animating through codesetContentOffsetcode, but I cannot get it to work when the codeUIScrollViewcode is moving due to being swiped. When the codeUIScrollViewcode is swiped and still in motion, the first tap after swiping will stop it moving, and then only the second tap is picked up by the codeUITapGestureRecognizercode. I hope to get the first tap to both stop the codeUIScrollViewcode from scrolling and also write to the console through the codeUITapGestureRecognizercode. p  pI hope that my problem here is just through a gap in my knowledge of either the codeUIScrollViewcode or codeUITapGestureRecognizercode and there is just a Property to set to fix this, but so far no amount of reading has helped me with this issue. Any ideas on whether this is possible p  pstrongEdit Thanks for the suggestions, please see belowstrong p  pApologies, I dont think I explained myself very well. I realise the first movement on the stationary codeUIScrollViewcode is a swipe which in my case is just handled by the codeUIScrollViewcode btw, not a gesture recognizer. p  pThe problem is after swiping and releasing, if you tap  emwhile it is still in motionem and no other touch is in progress, it isnt picked up by the codeUITapGestureRecognizercode, instead it is only picked up by the codeUIScrollViewcode and  stops the codeUIScrollViewcode moving. If you let it decelerate then tap, this works fine. Also if it is moving due to an animation but not a swipe, the tap also works fine. p  pThis is the same when using a UILongPressGestureRecognizer which is what I want to use ideally, but thought if I cant get it to work with a tap, I have no chance with that  p

Negative 2827 pSo Ive been writing a simple 3D GUI application that I intended for users to use simply by doubleclicking on the JAR file. I got it working perfectly before putting it into the JAR file, and I got it working perfectly IN the JAR file while running from command prompt typing java jar Modeler.jar while in the directory of the jar file. However, when I doubleclick it, nothing happens. It runs perfectly fine with no errors from command prompt. I know from experience that crash reports on startup are not shown because the console doesnt appear or it disappears too fast, but when running from the command prompt there are no crash reports. Any ideas as to why it wont work Im running Windows 7 Home Premium. Here are the contents of the JAR file if it helps  p  precodeModeler.jar  all the class files necessary  METAINF        MANIFEST.MF codepre  pContents of MANIFEST.MFp  precodeManifestVersion 1.0 BuiltBy AnonymousJohn ClassPath binj3dcore.jar binj3dutils.jar binvecmath.jar CreatedBy 1.6.016 Sun Microsystems Inc. MainClass Start codepre  pEDIT So after messing with the file associations to use java.exe instead of javaw.exe thereby providing a window for printouts, then modifying the startup mechanism a little to print out the current working directory, I discovered that the jar is running from CWindowssystem32 instead of the folder on my desktop I put it in. Go figure. However, moving the necessary outside files there doesnt help anything.  p  pEDIT 2 I tried making another JAR file, this time with a simple JFrame with a button in it that tells you the current working directory. Press the button and it opens a useless JFileChooser. This worked on doubleclick no matter where I put it in my computer. So there must be something wrong with my JAR file. Ill start troubleshooting my program again.  p  pEDIT 3 The problem is just what I thought it was its not loading libraries correctly when I double click on it. The weird part is that in my tests where I display the current path and library path, the output is exactly the same whether I run it via command prompt or via doubleclicking on it. Heres the stack tracep  precodejava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError no j3dcored3d in java.library.path   at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibraryUnknown Source   at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0Unknown Source   at java.lang.System.loadLibraryUnknown Source   at javax.media.j3d.NativePipeline1.runNativePipeline.java231   at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method   at javax.media.j3d.NativePipeline.loadLibraryNativePipeline.java200   at javax.media.j3d.NativePipeline.loadLibrariesNativePipeline.java157   at javax.media.j3d.MasterControl.loadLibrariesMasterControl.java987   at javax.media.j3d.VirtualUniverseltclinitgtVirtualUniverse.java299   at javax.media.j3d.Canvas3D.ltclinitgtCanvas3D.java3881   at ModelPreview.ltinitgtModelPreview.java51   at Modeler.ltinitgtModeler.java76   at Modeler.mainModeler.java1227   at Start.mainStart.java92 codepre  pOnly problem is that it IS in the library path. I specifically set it in the program. Now that I think about it that may be the problem. I set it like so this was a method I found somewhere on the internet. I dont remember wherep  precodeabove was code to get newPath based on the Operating System. all this code is set in a trycatch phrase. reset the library path System.setPropertyjava.library.path, .binnatives  newPath   make sure the ClassLoader rereads the NEW path. Field f  ClassLoader.class.getDeclaredFieldsyspaths f.setAccessible true  f.setnull, null ClassLoader will automatically reread the path when it sees that it is null.   codepre  pEDIT FINAL Well, after looking and relooking at my code, I discovered the problem was in some BSery involving the detection of 64bit systems where it was loading the wrong dlls. Why it worked from the commandline and not via doubleclick I dont know and will probably never know, but it works via doubleclick now, so Im happy. Sorry about the troubles.p

Negative 2827 pIn my view, there are 5 dropdownlists. The first one is populated when the user first gets to the page. Then the rest of the dropdowns are populated based on what they select from the dropdowns. The binding of the dropdowns work fine..no problem. Basically, there is a submit button on the page which displays the results from the values selected from the dropdowns. The problem is on HttpPost, whatever was selected from the dropdown, they disappear. The other thing is while i keep changing the selectedvalue and do submit, they show up. p  pFor example, i select values from each of the dropdowns. Do a submit, the results display and only the first one shows the selected value. The rest are gone. Then on the same time, I select the remaining values, do a submit, now the first and second show up and the rest are gone. I repeat the same thing, do a postback and the 1st, second and thrid show up and the remaining are gone. Not sure whats happening here. Let me know if I would need to update this post with my code.

Negative 2827 pstrongSetupstrong I have a custom class Ive created that handles data retrieved from a web source using ASIHttpRequest. This data is json encoded. In the completion block of the async request , the custom object is allocated to memory and the json values are set to their corresponding properties. strongThis object is property of the viewstrong. Within the completion block, a method to setup the view is called and the object is passed into a headerView which is subclassed from UIView and is then set to tableView.tableHeaderView. At this point everything works strongperfectlystrong. UILabels in the headerView are set using the custom objects properties without a hitch. p  pstrongProblemstrong Within the view, I have a UIBarButton that calls a method. When this method is called and I attempt access any property from the custom object, the program crashes iPhone simulator freezes and xcode points to the line in which the property is attempting to be accessed and says Thread 1. There arent any errors in the debugger. When I NSLog the custom object, there is a memory address returned which matches the address when I dont have any problems accessing it.p  pAny ideas Are their any debugging methods to help work this out  I dont understand why one method of the view doesnt have any problems accessing these properties and another would.

Negative 2827 pIm 90 sure of the answer to this question, but Id like to be positivep  pBy default e.g. not using the 301 modifier, does modrewrite route internally within Apache or redirect the client via http headers or some other methodp  pAll of my intuition, research, and experience indicates that the redirection is done internally.  By internally, I mean that the client is oblivious to the fact that modrewrite is in use.  For example, consider the following rulep  precodeRewriteRule [] dispatcher.htmlcat1 codepre  pWhen a request is made for which this rule applies e.g. codeexample.comtestingcode, the request is redirected e.g. to codeexample.comdispatcher.htmlcattestingcode. My understanding of modrewrite is that the module simply rewrites the request so it appears that the original request came to codeexample.comdispatcher.htmlcattestingcode.p  pIs this correctp

Negative 2827 pWhat is the bestpractice for developing webpages for both nonJSenabled and JSenabled pages I am developing a Spring MVC webapplication using JSPJSTL as the view technology. p  pThe way I work is to create a full webpage with html, head, etc tags in it. This will work on all browsers. My entire app works however uglybugly with JS disabled.p  pAlso included in each page is some jQuery script that prettifies the page, typically turning toplevel divs into tabs, other divs into dialogs, etc. The JS hijacks the underlying HTML. My JS hijacks the links and buttons, using AJAX calls to load the content into the correct dialog or tab div.p  pThis all works nicely and I like the architecture, but I have added an optimisation such that the AJAX requests appends a contentOnly parameter this is picked up by the Spring MVC view which conditionally ignores the head, etc  i.e. it only renders the real content that the AJAX version wants. It just feels clunky. p  pI know I could load the entire page and discard the outer bits but this seems inefficient to load all the associated CSS and JS files which are not strictly necessary.p  pMy question is is there a nicer way to write this conditional formatting, should I be using a different view technology or something else, something like Velocity or FreeMarker or whatever Grails usesp  pAn example of my conditional p  precodelt page languagejava contentTypetexthtml charsetISO88591 pageEncodingISO88591gt  lt taglib prefixc urihttpjava.sun.comjspjstlcore gt lt taglib prefixfmt urihttpjava.sun.comjspjstlfmt gt  ltcif testparam.contentOnly  nullgt ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lt include filestylesAndScripts.jspgt     lttitlegtMy App Titlelttitlegt ltheadgt  ltbodygt     lt include fileheader.jspgt     lt include filemenu.jspgt ltcifgt     ltdiv idleadListPanel classcontentPanelgt         lth1gtMy App Titlelth1gt         ltpgtThe time on the server is serverTime.ltpgt          lttable idleadTable classlistgt                     ... rest of content...  ltcif testparam.contentOnly  nullgt      lt include filefooter.jspgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt ltcifgt codepre

Negative 2827 pI have a site that uses FB LoginSignup button. This button is handled by JavaScript SDK. Also in the sign up page, I have another type of signup form.

I will have to replacemodify the default config files with my own of course, can I do this with an install script before I install apachephpmysql, I think I read somewhere that apache doesnt override existing config files, not sure about the others. brbr Is there anything else I am not taking into consideration Basically I want the installation to be as automated as possible and I definitely want to avoid things like the mysql server setup which would be pretty silly in an already made server install package. brbrIm new with web development in general and I have also never made an installation file before so that is why I have so many questionsp
Negative 2827 pWe recently had an issue with an Eclipse project for one of our team members. Tomcat was not deploying JARs of the application. p  pWe eventually noticed the code.classpathcode Eclipse file was not the same as for the team members where the project was OK. We replaced the code.classpathcode file with one from a project that was OK and the Tomcat deploy was complete.p  pJust out of curiosity and to know at what to look in the future if something is wrong, strongwhat is  inside the code.classpathcode and code.projectcode files. What can I add in there, what does it all meanstrongp

Negative 2827 pI am having a real pain of trying to draw multiple polygons from a geojson file. Below I have pasted a sample of the geojson file and the javascript used to access it. It seems the main problem I am running into is that I cannot get into that array of coordinates nested in each record as it either returns the error that coordinates is undefined or that there is no method setMap for undefined. I have been able to return other nested aspects of a similar JSON file this is a test file, the real one actually has data, just trying to get the polygon drawing here, but getting those coordinates is not working. I am not a javascript master so I cant tell where the code is failing to make the proper access.p  pthanks in advance.p  pthe json data looks like thisp  precodevar data     type FeatureCollection,

This really has me stumped. Thanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong It looks like the caching only works at a certain level of the Blackberry libraries. I have added logic to check the current Software level and turn on the caching if it is supported by the devices current software level. This provides me with a good work around, but i would still like to know if there is a better way for the caching to work with all devices.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Based on comments The site no longer displaying properly pertains to site not displaying the proper layout, images and text. It basically give a white background with links and text displaying as a bulleted list, all formatting removed.p

Negative 2827 pI have a HashMap called codeexamListcode which stored exam grades of each course a student took. The key of this hashmap is codecourseIDcode, and the value is an array list codegradeListcode which contains all grades a student got in a course. The problem is as followsp  precode Add a new course exam listing  where each course exam can be done a max 5 times protected void addExamString courseID, int grade      ArrayListltIntegergt gradeList      First check if course is in the list, if not add it     if  examList.containsKeycourseID           gradeList  new ArrayListltIntegergt         examList.putcourseID, gradeList         examList.getgradeList.addgrade      If course is already on the list, check if max number of attempts has been reached, if not add new grade      else if  examList.containsKeycourseID          if  gradeList.size lt 5              THIS IS WHERE ERROR OCCURES             examList.getgradeList.addgrade  HERE ALSO         else             System.out.printlnMaxim number of attempts has been reached.       codepre  pAs you can see I first define gradeList, but I do not yet initialize it. Under IF I check if student has already done this exam before. If he hasnt then new entry is created for hashmap, and gradeList is finally initialized. Under ELSE where, it is considered that there is an element with gradeList already initialized I just add new grade. However, that seems to be the problem. I cant compile it because program presumes that gradeList is not yet initialized here.  So, how can I fix this Or can I avoid it since logically, gradeList will always be initialized under ELSE through error handling, of which I know little aboutp

Negative 2827 pI have an assignment for a business which is basically just about extracting data from a database Microsoft SQL Server 2008. In the process, the users will be able to choose which columns to select, choose which view to select from, and build the WHERE clause. Based on what the user chooses, the SQL query is constructed accordingly. A requirement is that the user may select ANY column from ANY view and filter by ANY column in the WHERE clause. The company does not want the solution to use data warehouseOLAP, and wants to limit any third party software. So basically they just want a .NET Windows Forms application which dynamically constructs SQL queries based on a GUI and connects to a database.p  pMy concern here is how to optimize the queries. I am by no means good at optimizing SQL queries yet, but my first thought was what if the user chooses to filter by a column which has no index in the WHERE clause By giving the user so much flexibility, they can potentially construct queries that are so ineffective that they will take a long time to execute.p  pI realize that the performance can never be good with a lot of data if they filter on columns that have no indices, but is there anything I can do to improve it For sure I cannot just add indices to all columns.p  pI am not necessarily just looking for query optimization, but I am also thinking if there are any server tweaks that I can do, such as caching Basically I am all ears and looking for any advice that can help me improve the performance.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 2827 pI need to get some sensitive data from an Oracle server to a SQL Server for use in my ASP.NET website. Lets say its passwords. Our security guys say that these passwords need to be secured every step of the way. My website needs to be able to compare user input to these passwords. These passwords must be transferred from the Oracle server to SQL Server at night and can only be used on SQL Server during the day.p  pThe best solution I can come up with is that we need to hash the passwords on Oracle and pass the hashes to SQL Server lets assume the connection between the two is secure, because thats not my job P . Then my ASP.NET web application needs to be able to implement the exact same hashing on user input so we can compare the input hash to the database hash.p  pSo my question is how can I hash something using the same algorithmkeysalt on Oracle and .NET  I know how to use the .NET hashing functions, but Im not sure what I can use in Oracle that would be comparable...  I could potentially pass them in plain text from ASP.NET to SQL Server and hash them there if thats easier, but lets call that Plan B.p

Negative 2827 pim working on a .NET application that would allow me and subsequent users to input audio and picture assets and then organize them on a 2D grid. This was assigned to a 4 person group, of which 2 can program and one myself knows C. None of us have experience making Windows applications and i dont even know what kind of things to Google that will help me out. I was able to design a GUI for it not too hard with Visual Studio but i have no idea on how to make it import and display assets nor how to make a 2D grid and be able to assign locations there. Any adviceassistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks p

Negative 2827 pI have an activeMQ broker using an SSL transport. I have about 10 consumers that are using the broker. I am using camel to configure my routes. p  pEvery so often, it hangs up and will not consume new messages, even if I restart the consumers, even though there are messages pending in the queues.p  pI started trying to isolate where this was happening by stepping through my consumers one at a time trying to replicate the problem. I finally got to a consumer that I could recreate the problem on. It will hang after a period of time, however, if I go to the active MQ admin console and try to view messages in the queue, it will start running again. I think that Jetty is causing a connection to happen to refresh the queue for the webpage, and thus unblocking some thread problem I am having. How should I debug thisp  pThanksp

Negative 2827 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq6317367269126MSDN is a huge hierarchical doc site.ap  pTo be more precise, the content is organized in a hierarchical manner, but the URLs are not. The URL space is flat, making it look like everything is in the same directory. In reality, there probably isnt a directory I guess things are coming out of some other database but thats not relevant here.p  pSo if you want to download part of MSDN, say, the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd9y37ha.aspx relnofollowNMake manuala, you cant just recursively download everything below a given directory. Because that will be all of MSDN. Too much for your hard drive and bandwith.p  pBut you could write a script that looks at the DOM HTML to then follow and download only those links contained in certain navigational sections of the document, like those of CSS codeclasscode attribute codetocchildrencode and codetocsiblingscode, but not codetocparentcode.p  pWhat youd need would be some downloader that allows you to sayp  precodewebclientgtaddlinks xpathexpression   or webclientgtaddlinks cssselector  codepre  pIt shouldnt be too difficult to cobble something together using Perl, LWP and XMLLibXML HTML parser, but maybe you know of a tool that allows you to do just that so I dont need to reinvent it.p  pIt doesnt have to be Perl, any other language is fine, too, and so is a readymade program that has the flexibility required for this job.p

When I thought that probably there is some feature or plugin for Eclipse that can track it for me and show me. After all, this is information the java compiler has at hand.p  pWhat I need is to see the strongorderstrong in which each method is called and returns. p  pIt should print the method name and all the stack above it, so I can know who called.p  pstrongOptionallystrong, if it prints the time of enter and return and the difference, it would be good info for profiling.p  pI remember trying TraceView in the past, I dont know if it is the answr, but I clearly remember that there was too much information there and I could not get a clear picture of what was going on.br If someone knows how to properly use it to get only the info I need, it would be great too.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr I am having hard time using TraceView and his companion dmtracedump. I did something I wasnt supposed to do, I searched dmtracedump code source and look into it.br This is code producing the error message I am getting.p  precodeTraceData data1 DataKeys dataKeys  parseDataKeysampdata1, gOptions.traceFileName,                                    ampsumThreadTime if dataKeys  NULL      fprintfstderr, Cannot read trace.n     exit1  codepre  pBut I dont know how to fix the trace file.br  It is generated by         codeDebug.startMethodTracingtracefilecodep  pI wish there was a way to tell the Java compiler to print each method call. I am quite frustrated at this point.p

Negative 2827 pI have been working on this app for at least 34 months and just recently it hasnt been working.p  pIt started today, because yesterday it was running fine and smooth. Now it runs, but the window doesnt become visibleI checked the process list in Task Manager and it was running. I have made sure that the  ShowWindowhwnd, nFunsterStil was not accidentally deleted, but it is still there.p  pI believe the problem to be something with WMPAINT because that is what I was working on when the program stopped working.p  pThis is what I had when it compiled and first started being invisiblep  precode    PAINTSTRUCT ps     HDC hdc     case WMPAINT                      hdc  BeginPainthwnd, ampps                      static RECT Background, Background2                     SetRectampBackground, 0, 0, 476, 555                     SetRectampBackground2, 300, 300, 200, 400                     FillRecthdc, ampBackground, HBRUSH INTPTRCreateSolidBrushRGB50,55,50                     FillRecthdc, ampBackground2, HBRUSH INTPTRCreateSolidBrushRGB100,200,100                     EndPainthwnd, ampps                      codepre  pNow I tried getting rid of some of the lines in there, making the whole block into a comment, and even entirely deleting it but it did not help anything.

Negative 2827 pI have a Rails 3.2.6 application which requires you to login to use it. It also has an Rails Engine mounted to codeapicode which provides a JSON API to certain parts, without requiring authentication.p  pWhen I kick up the Rails server and make the following requestsp  precodeGET apisomething GET  GET apisomething codepre  pEverything works as expected, the API requests returns JSON as they should, the home page renders the html page.p  pHeres the weird part. If I make the requests in this order right after starting the  Rails serverp  precodeGET  GET apisomething GET apisomething codepre  pThen the API requests fail. The before filters from the root Rails app fire for the API engine, causing a redirect to codeUserSessionsControllernewcode, which doesnt exist in the API engine, and fails. While if make a request to the API engine first instead of the root Rails app, the API engine does not inherit before filters. Any light shed on this weirdness would be great p  pThough my current plan is to turn the API engine into a properly selfcontained Rack app. It seems the only reason its an engine at this point is cause someone before me really liked engines.p

Negative 2827 pWhen you retrieve the ID of a selector with codeselectorcode, is the selector value different depending on the types of the argumentsp  pHeres what I mean. I have a method that takes an object reference and a selector, then calls it with a parameterp  precodevoidCallLaterNSObject Obj Sel SELSel      Some stuff, then     [Obj performSelector Sel withObject SomeOtherObject]  codepre  pIm using this method with a selector to a function that takes a typed object reference, not an codeidcodep  precodevoidMyMethod MyObject a    [self CallLater self SelselectorMyMethod] codepre  pIt seems to work, but my senses are tingling. In a statically typed language like C this would be a foul, an upcast  codeCallLatercode is expecting a selector for a function that takes an codeidcode and Im giving it a function that takes a codeMyObjectcode.p  pOn the other hand, the compiler does not complain, and both codeidcode and concrete object references seems to be mere pointers deep down, trivially castable to one another. Then again, there are many fouls that Objective C compiler does not complain about.p  pSo the real question is  is it safe Language lawyers welcome.p

Negative 2827 pSo I know this question has been asked 20 other times and 20 different ways but after all of my researching I still cant seem to figure this out.  My setup works great until I type in a URL with a trailing slash and then I get 404 errors.  For example, when I type in the URL codemydomain.comfirstcode and hit enter, it works fine.  When I type in codemydomain.comfirstcode and hit enter, it works fine then too.  But then, if I type in codemydomain.comsecondcode it sends me to codemydomain.comfirstsecondcode and throws a 404 error.p  pHere is my entire htaccess pagep  precodeltIfModule modrewrite.cgt RewriteEngine On RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule [azAZ09] index.phpurl1 [NC,L] ltIfModulegt codepre  pMy index pagep  precodeltphp defineROOTDIR, dirnameFILE .

Negative 2827 pI have a view that displays an image field among other fields from some content nodes.  I want the image field to link to the content node so Ive set its formatter to Image and linked it to the node.  However, Id like to have an additional link on the view page possibly in the view header area that would display all the images on the page in a colorbox.p  pIve tried adding a rel tag to all the images displayed by the view and then configuring the link in the header area to have a class of colorbox and a rel tag that matches those of the images and a src attribute set to the URL of the image from the views first row but all I get in the colorbox then is that single image, not the rest of the ones on the page.p  pIm a bit nave in my understanding of how this all works and would appreciate any advice on how to get this working.p

I am storing CheckIns, Recipients, and ContactMethods.p  pThese objects are related as followsp  precodeCheckIn ltmany  to  manygt Recipient Recipient ltone  to  manygt ContactMethod codepre  pIn Java, these objects fields are defined as followsp  precodepublic class CheckIn      private int id     private boolean isEnabled     private Date startTime     private Repetition repetition      private SetltRecipientgt recipients   public class Recipient          private String name     private SetltContactMethodgt contactMethods       public class ContactMethod          private String type     private String address      codepre  pThe database schema I have come up with for these objects is defined as followsp  precodeCREATE TABLE checkIn   id               INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,   isEnabled         INTEGER,   startTime         INTEGER,   repetitionNum     INTEGER,   repetitionUnits   TEXT   CREATE TABLE recipient   id               INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,   name              TEXT   CREATE TABLE contactMethod   id                       INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,   type                      TEXT,   address                   TEXT,   recipientID               INTEGER,   FOREIGN KEYrecipientID REFERENCES recipientid ON DELETE CASCADE   CREATE TABLE checkInrecipient   checkInID         INTEGER,   recipientID       INTEGER,   FOREIGN KEYcheckInID REFERENCES checkInid,   FOREIGN KEYrecipientID REFERENCES recipientid  codepre  pI have two questions.p  pstrong1. How do I efficiently INSERT a CheckIn to the database, along with its related objectsstrongp  pTo be more specific, if I have a CheckIn object in Java, not yet committed to the database, how can I structure an INSERT statement that will insert the CheckIn to the CheckIn table, but also store the new CheckIns relation to one or more Recipients It seems like to store the relation to the Recipients, I would need to already know the checkIn.id, which hasnt been set yet, since the CheckIn hasnt been entered into the database yet.p  pstrong2. In Android, what is the best way to rebuild a CheckIn object, for example, from a database querystrongp  pI think I know the SQL query that I will need to get the right data p  precodeSELECT checkIn., recipient.name, contactMethod.type, contactMethod.address FROM checkIn JOIN checkInrecipient     ON checkIn.id  checkInrecipient.checkInID JOIN recipient     ON checkInrecipient.recipientID  recipient.id JOIN contactMethod     ON recipient.id  contactMethod.recipientID codepre  pThis query will get me rows of data containing all of the information I need to build an object for every CheckIn and Recipient in the database, and I know how to get a Cursor object that will iterate through these rows. However, since the data required for a single CheckIn appears on multiple rows, I am confused about the best way to construct individual CheckIn objects. If I am trying to write a method like codepublic SetltCheckIngt getAllCheckInscode that will return a set of all CheckIns that are stored in the database, do I need to run the query above, then loop through each row with the same checkIn.id, and within that loop, every row with the same recipient.id, and so forth Is there any better way to do thisp  pI am sorry for the long question. I have only been working with SQL beyond single table databases since this morning, and I didnt want to leave out any important information. Let me know if I missed something.p

My issue is how to populate the generic structure.p  pFor example an internal bunch of fieldsp  precode[Serializable] public class Location      public string sAddress  get set      public string sCity  get set      public int iZipCode  get set   codepre  pNeeds to be transformed intop  precodeltAttributeListgt   ltAttributegt     ltNamegtsAddressltNamegt     ltValuegt123 ABC StreetltValuegt     ltDataTypegtstringltDataTypegt   ltAttributegt ltAttributeListgt codepre  pRepeat for sCity and iZipCode.p  pOnly I am not sure the best way to do this, as some of the fields, e.g. iZipCode may not be instantiated. p  pThe only way I can think of is to have code looking for each specific field in the internal data structure, making sure it is not null, then mapping the Attribute.Name from a enum object or something that contains the actual internal field name like sAddress, then the value, and then setting the type as I know what type if field that is as I am looking for it specifically.p  pThis is fine if there are only 3 fields, but there will be far more than that, and it seems like a bad approach, as if a new field is added I need to update the code  not to mention a lot of code that is basically doing the same thing.p  pIdeally I would like something that can generically cycle through everything in the internal structure, e.g. Location, and automatically check if the field is there, pulling the name of the field, value and type if it is without having specific code for each field.p  pI dont know if this is possible, any advice would be appreciatedp

Negative 2827 pThe following code base worked for years on Windows Server, Windows XP and became unreliable on Windows 7.p  pTwo COM components, caller and callee, share the same transaction context and participate in indirect recursion.  The caller initially calls the callee multiple times, and the callee always eventually calls codeSetCompletecode or codeSetAbortcode before returning regardless of whether this is a CallerCallee invocation, or maybe CallerCalleeCallerCallee.p  pWhat I see is that the first SQL query inside the second invocation of the callee errors out withp  blockquote   pDistributed transaction completed. Either enlist this session in a new transaction or the NULL transactionp blockquote  pThe transactions are, in some configurations, very slow and can easily exceed 60 seconds of duration.p  pThe error looks like a transaction timeout, or maybe component deactivation following the suspect codeSetCompletecode which is setting the done bit.  However, it was not the root component of the transaction and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms68159028vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowthis documentationa specifically says emHowever, unless the object calling SetAbort is the root of the transaction, the transaction continues to run even though nothing can save it from eventually aborting.em a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryyfktbhxc28vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowThis documentationa says emA transaction is neither committed nor aborted until the root object of the transaction deactivates.em so I am not sure whether the codeSetCompletecode could be contributing to the error somehow.p  pTransaction timeout is set to 1800 seconds at component level for all components at install time, the global transaction timeout is set to 60 seconds.

Negative 2827 pI have wpf, c, sql express application, which means software with database. Lets say I have a tab item, inside tab item there are data grids. From one data grid I buy staff and put it to Basket Data grid. Suppose in my main data grid there was 10 pencils and I bought 5. Now it is 5 in Main Data grid and 5 in Basket data grid. Until I press buy button it will stay in the Basket. Now my question is, suppose electricity went down and my application is closed. In my main data grid is 5 and Basket is 0 after initializing. So I am losing what it was in my basket. I could manage it while closing application or closing tab items. But can not manage it, when application is closed improperly. Is there any mechanism, method, event to handle this in c I know most of you will say use transaction, I will use in next version which will be not soon. For now I want to find how to deal with this with out transaction. I hope you understand what I mean. Any ideasp  pHere example  Suppose you gave 12 pens and 15 pencils in your stockMain data grid. And you are selling 2 pens and 5 pencils from you stock. And when you are selling it is going to Basket data grid. Now in Main data grid 10 pens and 10 pencils. In the basket 2 pens and 5 pencils. If I do not click submit button it will not be recorded in the sell data base. Suppose I am working and selling items from stock and electricity goes down. In my stock there are 10 pens and 10 pencils. Basket is empty. And it is not recorded in sell database because did not click buttonp
Negative 2827 pI have a datagrid that may display many rows per page.  Lets say I am displayed 25 rows per page.

So there is a scroll bar on the grid.p  pWhen I remove a single row in the grid, the grid automatically moves to the first row in the grid.  If I have scrolled the bottom and deleted the last row, I am once again moved to the 1st row.p  pI have attempted several ways of combatting this, but I cant find a solution that works the way I want it to.p  pIve tried scrolling the row directly before or after the deleted row into view using the scrollIntoView method.p  pIve tried figuring out how to determine which rows were in the visible range before the deletion, but the getVisibleRange method is relevant to the page range, not the actual displayed range.p  pIve searched the web for this and seems like Im the only one having this problem.

Negative 2827 pI have a program that executes the same code sequentially and in parallel simultaneously between various checkpoints throughout the program. To do this, the initial program forks off a child process which runs sequentially whilst the parent process runs in parallel. Whichever process reaches the next checkpoint first then kills off the other process and this repeats until the end of execution thereby executing as fast as possible ignoring fork and copy overheads.p  pI have implemented this and everything works fine when only sequential execution is the fastest, or only parallel execution is the fastest, but when the first few sections execute fastest in parallel followed by the next few executing fastest sequentially the program stalls with both processes sleeping. I cannot see what could be causing this. Have I hit some limit imposed on forking processes Can killing a parent process affect the execution of a forked child process or vice versap  pThe code below gives my function codecheckPointcode which is executed at every checkpoint, with some custom code handling the end of the final section.

Negative 2827 pI recently ran into a problem in our SQL Server 2008 Analysis Services Cube. Imagine you have a simple sales data warehouse with orders and products. Each order can be associated with several products, and each product can be contained in several orders. So the data warehouse consists out of at least 3 tables One for the Products, one for the Orders and one for the reference table, modelling the nn relationship between both. The question I want our cube to answer is How many orders are there which contain both product x and product y In SQL, this is easyp  precodeselect orderid from dbo.OrderRefProduct where ProductID  1 intersect select orderid from dbo.OrderRefProduct where ProductID  3 codepre  pSince I am fairly proficient in SQL, but a newbie in MDX, I have been unable to implement that in MDX. I have tried using distinct count measures, the MDXfunctions codeintersectcode and codenonemptycode and subcubes. I also tried duplicating the dimensions logically by adding the dimension to the cube twice as well as physically by duplicating the data source table and the dimension.p  pOn a hrefhttpwww.zeitz.netthtsintersection.zip relnofollowhttpwww.zeitz.netthtsintersection.zipa, you can download a zip file of 25kB size which contains an SQL script with some test data and the Analysis Services Solution using the tables.p  pWe are using SQL Server 2008 R2 and its Analysis Services counterpart. Performance considerations are not that important, as the data volume is rather low millions of rows compared to the other measure groups included in that cube billions of rows.p  pThe ultimate goal would be to be able to use the desired functionality in standard OLAP custom calculated measures are ok, since Excel is our primary frontend, and our customers would like to choose their Products from the dimension list and get the correct result in the cube measures. But even a working standalone MDXQuery would greatly help.p  pThank youp  pstrongEdit March 12thstrong Did I miss something or cant this be solved somehowp  pIf it helps to build the mdx, here is another way to get the results in sql, using subquerys.

Im changing how the data is laid out by inserting each respective item into separate tables and adding relationships between each entity. p  pFor example, a city can have multiple zip codes and a zip code can sometimes cover multiple cities so that would be represented by a many to many relationship. Cities and zip codes have only one state so that relationship is many to one.p  pI have a table for cities, zip codes, and states. I also have a table for relating cities to zip codes. I will need to modify my relationship table schema to take into effect that cities with the same name may exist in multiple states. The relationship table should really be a set including the city, state and zip code and not just the city and zip code.p  pMy end goal is to distribute the SQL Server CE database with password protection with another application for city, state and zip code validation. I dont want to distribute the CSV database as anyone could change that to pass validation.p

That is the question Im concered.p  pI do have clojuremode and other libs nrepl.el use. But they are all in different directoryIn my case, emacs.dpacksliveclojurepacklib. Do I have to duplicate these files into my cloned nrepl project in order to run the test Is there a better way to run test files like we do in IDE. For instance, in Intellij, I simply write import statements in test files, and it automatically prepares the dependency libs for me. This bothers me quite a lot. Im wondering if there is a best practice for this problem.p

Negative 2827 pIm working on a hrefhttpsgithub.comlihaoyimacropy relnofollowMacroPya, and one of the things the project does is hook into the Python import system via PEP302 import hooks.

Negative 2827 pmy question is quite tricky so Ill try to make it as clear as possible.p  pIn my program, I compare cells value with a database in order to find matches.  The cells I am comparing are under a column format, with one word in each cell. The cells from my database, on the other hand, contain a whole sentence in a cell. p  pstrongFor examplestrong   img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxtOIa.jpg altenter image description herep  pMy programs goal is to find matches to identify a place.  So far, here is what it is doing it activates cell from the database and compare with each cell of elementsListRange which is a selection of elements from the column so in my picture B2B7. When there is a match, it adds a score of 12 on the line. p  precode loop in the DATABASE   For i  a To b RangeB amp i.Activate    try to find a match btwn active cell and one of the elements from parsed address For Each cell In elementsListRange.Cells    If MatchActiveCell.Value, cell.Value Then     RangeK amp i.Value  RangeK amp i.Value  12     Else     RangeK amp i.Value  RangeK amp i.Value  0   End If Next codepre  pSo in this case, there is a match three times, with cell 1 corporate, cell 2 center and cell 3 building, which makes a total of 36 points.p  pstrongHere is what I want to do strong now, I want to make it more accurate by taking into account the position of words. So if the cell in the database is Corporate Center Building, and the words CorporateCenter and Building appear in the same order, it would add more points. The idea is  If there is a match between active cell and cell 1 Corporate, Then add 12 points and do another check  If match between active cell and cell 1  cell 2 Corporate Center, then add 10 additional points and do another If If match between active cell and cell 1  cell 2  cell 3 Corporate Center Building, add 15 additional point, and so on.p  pSo it wont only find matches, but it will give importance to the position of words.

Negative 2827 pMy client is a college professor who wants to add online quizzes for his students on his Wordpresspowered website, among other things. So Im building a custom plugin that allows him or any administrator to make these quizzes from the admin pages. All this info is saved in the mysql database in their own tables, no problem here. Its when showing the quizzes to the studentsregular users of the blog that I got lost.p  pWhat I wanted was a way to generate these quizzes. At first I figured a codeGETcode parameter with the quizs ID the student wants to do would do the trick, but then, where would that even go Should I use a separate php file in the main directory of wordpress and would that even work p  pShould I create a regular old post and slap the code with shortcodes Should I work with custom post types But remember the quizzes are already created in the database and I feel making one post, custom or regular, for each quiz seems excessive and complicated. Can you even make a wordpress page dynamic and pass it a parameter p  pOr is there a way to use hooks to rewrite the main page to show my code instead of the loop or any other place at all Or am I too far off and is there another method altogetherp

Negative 2827 pI am looking for a best way to import data to SQL from XML file. One of the requirements is to have whole db available on destination server which means that initially, large XML files should be transferred and later only new and updated files will be transferred.

My guess is that xml files should be just increments, like tablename1.xml, tablename2.xml etc. If that is the case, whats the best case to automatically read data from new filesp  pMaybe my logic is completely wrong and there is some better solutionp

Negative 2827 pI have been looking all of for an answer to this problem and have not been able to find anything. When my ISR is triggered, it goes through and does everything that it is supposed to perfectly fine, then before exiting and returning back to the main loop the ISR executes again. Once it has gone though the second time it then returns back to the main loop. This only happens when I use a 115V relay to operate the interrupt. p  pI am trying to detect when there is a power outage or when the power comes back on. I am using a Pin change interrupt to sense if the relay is closed or open. When the power goes out the relay will open and will trigger the ISR. If I connect this setup to a normal push button or switch everything works as needed and there is no problem, it is only when it is connected to the relay that there is a problem.p  pHere is the code that I haveI know I dont need cli I have just been trying everythingp  precodeISRPCINT2vect      cli      sbiPORTC,5     delayms6000     cbiPORTC,5     fordelaycounter0delaycounterlt2delaycounter              delayms6000          sbiPORTC,5     delayms6000     ifbitissetPIND,2              lcdclrscr         lcdputsSending SMS         usartprintat         USARTTransmitr         delayms6000         fori0ilt1i                              usartprintatsmsm2m                 USARTTransmit                 forj0jlt11j                                      USARTTransmitAlertNumbers[i][j]                                  usartprint Power has been lost                 USARTTransmit                 USARTTransmitr                 delayms6000                           lcdclrscr             lcdputsSMS Sent             delayms6000             lcdclrscr             lcdputsStatusNO POWER             cbiPORTC,5                   else ifbitisclearPIND,2                      lcdclrscr             lcdputsSystem Reset             delayms6000             delayms6000             usartprintat             USARTTransmitr             delayms6000             fori0ilt1i                              usartprintatsmsm2m                 USARTTransmit                 forj0jlt11j                                      USARTTransmitAlertNumbers[i][j]                                  usartprint Pump regained power                 USARTTransmit                 USARTTransmitr                 delayms6000                           lcdclrscr             lcdputsPOWER ON             delayms6000             lcdclrscr             lcdputsStatus Good                   else                        int mainvoid     Initializations     DDRC  0x20  PORTC,5 is now output     sbiPORTC,5     USARTInit51     lcdinitLCDDISPON     lcdclrscr      Set interrupts     DDRD   0b11111011    set PD2 to input     PORTD  0b00000100    set PD2 to high     PCICR  1 ltlt PCIE0     PCMSK0  1 ltlt PCINT0     PCICR  1ltltPCIE2     PCMSK2  1ltltPCINT18     sei       lcdclrscr     lcdputsStatus Good      Main Program Loop NOP     while1                  lcdclrscr             lcdputsMAIN LOOP             fordelaycounter0delaycounterlt3delaycounter                                  delayms6000                    codepre

Negative 2827 pIm currently working on translating our current Dart Web UI project to Polymer.dart. We use Bootstrap 3 for the frontend styling and many web animations e.g. dropdown menus, modals, tooltips. p  pHowever after I translated one Web UI component into Polymer, all the Bootstrap JavaScript stopped working for the sub component, since it was now encapsulated in the ShadowDOM. To access an element in the ShadowDOM from Dart I have to use the shadowRoot field, and from JavaScript in Chrome I have to use the webkitShadowRoot property, but still I cant get a single dropdown menu to work properly.p  pFirstly, after calling the dropdowntoggle API in bootstrap, the dropdown menu appears but never goes away. Also, it seems impossible to detect which link is triggered by the click event since the event is fired on the window level. This means I cant find which dropdown menu to display.p  pDoes anyone have experience using twitterbootstrap and Polymer togetherp

Negative 2827 pOk, this idea might seem quite a bit crazy and it kindo is at least for me at my level.  I have a fairly standarad rails app some content pages, a blog, a news block, some authentication. And I want to make it into a single page app.p  pWhat I want to accomplish isp  ol liAll the pages are fetched through codeAJAXcode like when using codeturbolinkscode, except that the AJAX returns only the codeview partcode the yield part in the layout withought the layout itself, which stays the same less data in the responces, quicker render and load time.li liThe pages are mostly just static html with codeAngularJScode markup so not much to process.li liAll the actual data is loaded separately through JSON and populated in the view. li liAlso the url and the page title get changed accordingly.li ol  pIve been thinking about this concept for quite a while and I just cant seem to come up with a solution. At this point Ive got to some ideas on how this actualy might be done along with some problems I cant pass. Any ideas or solutions are greatly appreciated. Or might be Ive just gone crazy and 3 small requests to load a page are worse then I big that needs all the rendering done on server side.p  pSo, heres my idea and known problems.p  ol liWhen user  first visits the app, the view template with angular markup is rendered regularly and the second request comes from the codeAngular Resourcecode. li liThen on ngClick on any link that adress is sent to ngInclude of the content wrapper. ol liHow do I bind that onClick on any link and how can I exclude certain links from that bind e.g. links to external authentication servicesli liHow do I tell the server not to render the layout if the request is comming from Angular I though about adding a parameter to the request, but there might be a better idea.li olli liWhen ngInclude gets the requested template, it fires the ngInit functions of the controllers usually a single one in that template and gets the data from the server as JSON along with the proper page title.li liAngular populates the template with the received data, sets the browser url to the url of the link and sets the page title to what it just got. ol liHow do I change the page title and the page url The title can be changed using jQuery, but is there a way through Angular itselfli liAgain, I keep thinking about some kind of animation to make this change more fancy.li olli liProfitli ol  pSo. What do you guys thinkp

Negative 2827 pI have a methodp  precodepublic TaskltTaskgt DoSomeWorkOnARemoteMachine codepre  pwhich, very descriptively, executes some work on a remote machine byp  ol liQueueing a message on a message bus signalling that work should be doneli liA remote agent picks up the message and executes the workli liThe work finishes and the agent queues a message on a message bus to say that the work is doneli liThe application which invoked the work picks up the message that the work is doneli ol  pThe reason I used codeTaskltTaskgtcode is because the first codeTaskltgtcode is for the queueing of the message while the inner codeTaskcode is completed when the work has been completed on the remote machine i.e. when the message from the agent has been received. Any exceptions which the remote agent caught during execution of the work are passed along with the completion message and are rethrown when the inner codeTaskcode completes. p  pTo call this method I usep  precodeawait await DoSomeWorkOnARemoteMachine codepre  pwhich would wait for the message to be queued to execute the job, as well as to complete the job and receive any exceptions. However, if I was not interested in whether the job completed on the remote agent or not, I might call it as followsp  precodeawait DoSomeWorkOnARemoteMachine codepre  pwhich would not codeawaitcode the inner codeTaskcode. However, the inner codeTaskcode which receives the message from the remote agent, and rethrows the exceptions would still execute at some point. I feel that this is a bit of a waste and I would like to avoid executing it when I dont codeawaitcode for the results. p  pMy question is thus is it possible for a codeTaskcode to know whether it is being codeawaitcodeed and not execute if it is not, or execute some other code path such as an empty codeTaskcode body. p  pI do realize that there are alternatives that I could implement, such as passing a fire and forget flag, or adding an overload for fire and forget. It would be great though if I could implement this without the client API changingp  pAnswers involving other projects which implement this sort of remote work execution would also be greatp

Negative 2827 pIm working on a macro for a friend of mine who needs to import a set of images in an excel document and later use this document on other computers. The problem I encountered is that when opening this document on a different computer, all the images are gone and instead you get these little error signs, indicating that the image path could not be found.p  pI have developed the macro on my own computer where I have Excel 2007 and for me, the code works perfectly fine. My friend uses Excel 2013 and apparently, there seems to be a major difference on how those 2 versions deal with the image importing and saving.p  pOverall, I found 2 different ways how to insert images. The first one I tried was something similar to thisp  precodeSet pic  ActiveSheet.Pictures.InsertCdocumentssomepicture.jpg codepre  pThe second way of doing this looked like thisp  precodeSet pic  Application.ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddPictureCdocumentssomepicture.jpg, False, True, 1, 1, 1, 1 codepre  pIn the documentation for this 2nd approach it is said that the 3rd paramenter which is True here is responsible for saving the picture with the document.p  pHowever, both these approaches look more or less the same in the end result They work fine for me but wont work if they are executed on my friends pc with Excel 2013. So what I need is a workaround for the newer Excel versions I read somewhere that from Excel 2010 upwards, there is a bug or something like that with these image import methods.p

Negative 2827 pI have a simple problem where I think I am missing something obvious but could not find anything to understand the behavior. I have a table and then a p tag and a div tag. All the samelevel tags are default positioned. Only the innerdiv in the last div has an absolute position. I thought that an absolute position in an innerdiv would be absolutely positioned relative to ITS outer div idouter.  p  pTherefore, I would expect the display to consist of, in vertical order, the table, Text1 and finally Text2. That is not what is happening. Table is displayed as expected, Text 1 is also displayed after table as expected. However, Text 2 is displayed on top of the table because it takes absolute position from the body tag or whatever is the outermost tag. Why How to get Text2 to position after Text1. I need Text2 to be positioned absolutely for a reason. Removing the absolute positioning on div idinner is not an option. So, how to get around this p  precode  lttable border1 stylebordercollapsecollapsegt       lttrgt         ltthgtHeader 1ltthgt       lttrgt       lttrgt         lttd gt09122013 1241 pmlttdgt        lttrgt   lttablegt   ltp styledisplayblockgtText1ltpgt   ltdiv idoutergt     ltdiv idinner styledisplayblockpositionabsolutetop30pxgtText2ltdivgt   ltdivgt codepre

Negative 2827 pBy default, in Spring Data Rest the Id of the entity is not exposed. In line with the REST rules, were supposed to use the URI of the resource to refer to it.

Negative 2827 pI have been looking at some USACO gold level algorithm problems, and I need someone to help explain the solution of this problem to me.  a hrefhttpwww.usaco.orgindex.phppageviewproblem2ampcpid365 relnofollowHerea is the problem, and the solution is belowp  blockquote   pUsually the first step in solving incrementalupdate problems is to solve the problem without the incremental updates, but in this case it can lead one up a blind alley. There is a quite simple DP solution to the nonincremental version of this problem, but it is not at all obvious how to incrementally update this in less than linear time.p      pInstead, we can find a divideandconquer DP solution that will be easier to update. Divide the range in half, and in each half solve the problem again. In fact, we solve four variants of the problem, depending on whether the left andor right endpoint is allowed to be used. Given these results from the two halves, we can easily combine them to form the results for the whole range. The ranges form a segment tree over the barn, where each tree node depends on its two children, and the answer is held at the root of the tree.p      pGiven this tree structure, it is now clear how we can make incremental updates in Olog N time an update affects a leaf of the tree, which in turn requires its Olog N ancestors to be updated.p blockquote  pThere is no code in this solution, and I dont really understand how to implement this idea.  I would really appreciate it if someone could explain it more thoroughly or show me how to code it.  p  pEditp  pI understand what the solution is saying better now, and I have coded a solution.

When I click on another container, Id like the same thing to happen, however, Id also like the previously opened menu to hide.

The data received is a segment of a large compressed stream.p  pCurrently, I maintain a codeMemoryStreamcode and am calling codeWritecode on it whenever I receive data. However, to decompress this data I need to wrap a codeDeflateStreamcode around it. The problem is that when you call codeReadcode on the codeDeflateStreamcode, it reads zero bytesp  pThis is because the codeDeflateStream.BaseStreamcode is the codeMemoryStreamcode I just wrote to, so the codeMemoryStream.Positioncode has been updated, for both reading strongandstrong writing.p  pIs there an alternative to calling codeMemoryStream.SeekbytesJustWritten, SeekOrigin.Currentcode after every single codeMemoryStream.Writecodep  pI need to be able to read the decompressed bytes in realtime without waiting for closure of the stream.p  pI thought I could just use two codeMemoryStreamcode objects, one for buffering my input and then one to copy into and then read from, but I quickly realized that it would present the same problem you cannot write to a stream and then read from it without first seeking.p

Negative 2827 pNSResponder defines numerous actions that are related to keyboard actions like codemoveUpcode, codemoveUpAndModifySelectioncode and codemoveToBeginningOfLinecode. With the exception of the actions that arent triggered by pressing a modifier key e.x. codemoveUpcode is simply the codeUpcode arrow key I cant get any of the actions to be called on my custom codeNSViewcode. p  pHeres the setup p  ul liXcode 5.1  10.9li liBasic Cocoa app with nothing more then a codeCustom Viewcode added to the main window.li liThis custom view is just an codeNSViewcode of class codeSTViewcodeli licodeSTViewcode does nothing more than override codeacceptsFirstRespondercode to return codeYEScodeli ul  pIn this setup, my codeSTViewcode instance will correctly receive all keyboard events including those with a modifier like codeCtlAcode in both codeperformKeyEquivalentcode and codekeyDowncode, as expected. Both methods are commented out for the discussion below.p  pIf I provide an implementation for codemoveUpcode, as defined in codeNSRespondercode then codemoveUpcode is correctly called when the user presses the codeUpcode arrow key. p  pConfusingly, codemoveUpcode is also called whenever the codeUpcode arrow key is pressed with a modifier key. When a modifier key is being held e.x. codeCtlUpcode I would expect the appropriate keyboard action method to be called.p  pEx p  ul licodeCtlUpcode  codemoveUpcode expected codescrollPageUpcodeli licodeAltUpcode  codemoveUpcode expected codemoveToBeginningOfParagraphcodeli licodeShiftUpcode  codemoveUpcode expected codemoveUpAndModifySelectioncodeli licodeCommandUpcode  codemoveUpcode expected codemoveToBeginningOfDocumentcodeli ul  pThis pattern repeats itself for all keymodifier combinations. p  pTwo areas in Apples documentation seem relevant p  ul lia hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualEventOverviewHandlingKeyEventsHandlingKeyEvents.html relnofollowHandling Keyboard Actions and Inserting Textali lia hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualEventOverviewEventArchitectureEventArchitecture.htmlapplerefdocuid10000060iCH3SW10 relnofollowThe Path of Key Eventsali ul  pReading through that documentation, it looks like the system is responsible for mapping key events to their appropriate key action. And indeed, this works for me when a modifier key is not pressed. But when a modifier key is pressed, then the event is just being handled like any other event and passed through the normal responder chain. p  pI can see the modifier key event coming in through codeNSApplication sendEventcode, though codeNSApplication sendActiontofromcode is never called, and continuing down the view hierarchy, which I would expect given my reading of the documentation above.  p  pThe documentation hints that text editing views might be treated differently. Are these keyboard actions only sent to views that edit text If not, then how does one get a message like codemoveUpAndModifySelectioncode to be called on their custom codeNSViewcode class when the user presses codeShiftUpcodep  pFor reference, Im using this chart for keyboard bindings, though to be frank Ive tried just about every combination, listed or not  p  ul lia hrefhttpwww.hcs.harvard.edujrussitesystembindings.html relnofollowDefault Mac OS X System Key Bindingsali ul  pAt the end of the day, I could likely just override codekeyDowncode and manually handle all the combinations Im interested in, but I was hoping to at least understand why this isnt working as intended for me. p  pNote that the intended application here is to allow the user to navigate a gridlike view of items, much like a collection view. p  pAny tips, advice or comments would be much appreciated. p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIf you do the following in your codekeyDowncodep  precode voidkeyDownNSEvent theEvent    ...

I assume this is because the actions Im interested in are textlike actions, which require the input manager to interpret and convert to their appropriate actions. p  pIts still not entirely clear to me why codemoveUpcode is properly getting called. Who in the responder chain is recognizing the codeUpcode arrow key being pressed and then sending out a codemoveUpcode messagep

Negative 2827 pI am having a table Employee which has employeeID and ManagerID. I would want to be able to drill down the tree structure from the ManagerID at the highest level and go down till the bottom of the tree. I understand that sybase does not support common table expression. Could you kindly suggest me ways of getting this information out when the levels of hierarchy is not known and will be different for different ManagerIDs.p  pI am guessing we might need a recursive procedure but how do i return this tree structure list from a procedure.p  pI looked around similar questions on the same topic but was not able to get anything concrete. Any kind of help will be appreciated.p
Negative 2827 pI am developing a social network and am having some problems with my profile pages. So what I am doing is having three divs as an example. One being the main post part, the other two being the about me and friends section. I have the post one floating on the left, and the sidebars floating on the right. When I have two divs on the sidebar on the right, the post div will not go directly under the cover, there will be a giant space there as if there were an invisible div there a hrefhttpprntscr.com3988wj relnofollowhttpprntscr.com3988wja Here is my htmlp  precodeltdiv idsidebargt     ltdiv classsidebarcontainergt         ltdiv classsidebarcontentgt         ltdiv classsidebarheadergtAboutltdivgt             ltdiv classsidebarlistgtBirthday ltbgt09052000ltbgtltdivgt             ltdiv classsidebarlistgtGender ltbgtMaleltbgtltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv idsidebargt     ltdiv classsidebarcontainergt         ltdiv classsidebarcontentgt         ltdiv classsidebarheadergtFriendsltdivgt             ltdiv classsidebarlistgtBirthday ltbgt09052000ltbgtltdivgt             ltdiv classsidebarlistgtGender ltbgtMaleltbgtltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv idmessagegt     ltdiv classmessagecontainergt     ltdiv classmessagecontentgt         ltdiv classmessagepaddinggt             ltdiv classmessageavatargtltimg srcltphp echo avatar gtgtltdivgt             ltdiv classmessageauthorgtlta hrefgtltphp echo user gtltagtltdivgt             ltdiv classmessagedategt12042014ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pHere is my cssp  precodemessage      float left     marginleft 20     width 44.4  .messagepadding      padding 10px 10px 10px 10px  .messagecontainer      padding 0 10px 10px 0  .messagecontent      boxshadow 0px 1px 1px CCC     border 1px solid BFBFBF     background fff     color 6B6B6B     borderradius 3px     overflow hidden     width 100  .messageavatar      width 42px     height 42px     float left     paddingbottom 10px  .messageavatar img      width 42px     height 42px     borderradius 3px  .messageauthor      color 3A5796     fontsize 12px     cursor pointer     fontweight bold     fontfamily Tahoma, Arial, Segoe UI, Verdana, sansserif     paddingleft 50px     paddingtop 5px     textdecoration none  .messageauthor a      color 3A5796     cursor pointer     fontweight bold     fontfamily Tahoma, Arial, Segoe UI, Verdana, sansserif     textdecoration none  .messagedate      color 999     fontsize 10px     cursor pointer     fontweight bold     fontfamily Tahoma, Arial, Segoe UI, Verdana, sansserif     paddingleft 50px     paddingtop 4px  sidebar      float right     marginright 19.49     width 16     clearboth  .sidebarcontainer      padding 0 10px 10px 0  .sidebarlist      margintop 1px     padding 7px 10px     bordertop 1px solid EEE     fontsize 12px  .sidebarcontent      boxshadow 0px 1px 1px CCC     border 1px solid BFBFBF     background fff     color 6B6B6B     borderradius 3px     overflow hidden     width 100  .sidebarheader      background f8f8f8     padding 10px     fontfamily Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sansserif     fontsize 13px     fontweight bold     color 777     borderbottom 1px solid EEE     width 100  codepre  pIs there any way to make it so the post div goes in the right place, and so other post divs can go under it, and other divs in the sidebar Thanks for any helpp

Negative 2827 pUsing Dimple, I would like to create a simple line chart with numeric XY data points. I use addMeasureAxis for Y axis. If I use addCategoryAxis for X, I get a data point for each X value if all X are unique, else dimple will aggregate for like values of X. If I use addMeasureAxis, again, Dimple will aggregate, this time by summing. If I modify the X values to be time hhmm and use addTimeAxis, dimple will treat each X value as a time, and will place the data points properly. Is there a way to create a similar chart with numeric X values of arbitrary scale Im not sure, but I may be asking if Dimple can create charts with no aggregation on the X values.p  pThe code for an XY line chart with time values on X axis is shown below. Note that the time values are not equally spaced.

Negative 2827 pCan you get mac addresses from Active Directory using Powershell  I am looking for a way to search for mac addresses in specific OUs if this is possible.

Console.ReadKey         end main     end class Program end namespace codepre  pThe problem Im having is twofold p  pFirst, the error on line 34 and 35 keeps saying that there is no constructor in MyClass that takes one argument. So its easy to deduce that, wow, I need a constructor that can take one argument in the class. I can make the constructor just fine, but the difficulty is in passing the var1 and var2. I believe I need to pass by reference here.p  pSecondly, I believe I need to take into consideration the fact that var1 and var2 are different variable types. This I really dont know what to do about. But the main question of this post is figuring out the first problem.p  pThe limitation put on us by the instructor is that we are not allowed to change anything within the Program class.p  pThe required output is as followsp  pDisplay your first name here Display your last name here Press any key to terminate.p

Negative 2827 pImagine this You have a number of controls which you want to have a context menu, the same menu. That context menu will be dynamic and can change at any time. So you create a static class like thisp  precodepublic static class EmployeeContextMenu      private static ContextMenu EmployeeMenu  get set       static EmployeeContextMenu              EmployeeMenu  new ContextMenu           public static ContextMenu Get              return EmployeeMenu           public static void SetListltStringgt employees              EmployeeMenu  new ContextMenu         MenuItem mi         foreach var item in employees                      mi  new MenuItem             mi.Header  item             EmployeeMenu.Items.Addmi                codepre  pAnd at some point you need to change the menu items and use the Set method above, works perfectly fine. Somehow you want to bind your controls context menu to the Get method. Might be achieved likep  precodeltWindow.Resourcesgt     ltObjectDataProvider ObjectTypexType localEmployeeContextMenu MethodNameGet xKeymyCM gt ltWindow.Resourcesgt ltGridgt     ltTextBlock Nametb ContextMenuBinding SourceStaticResource myCM gt ltGridgt codepre  pAnd of course you want the controls context menu to be updated as soon as the static Set method is called.p  pBut above, something is basically wrong with the binding...no context menu shows up at all. So how would you set the binding Datacontext, datasource Where and howp  pIt would of course work if you implementp  precodetb.ContextMenu  EmployeeContextMenu.Get codepre  pBut that would be a bad solution if you have an unknown number of dynamically created user controls which you badly want to have the mentioned context menu which will be updated on the fly.p

So, when I touch the screen somewhere where inFigure will return false I should be ignoring any move started with that touch, but still, my figure moves. With startMoving variable and additional checks everything works fine. But I dont want to use that variable, I want to know why my code doesnt work without it. What could be the issuep

Negative 2827 pIn short, Im trying to select an image from a phone gallery to display as a bitmap to be played with get average RGB in another activity.p  pFirst thing, Ive come across a couple topics dealing with URI to Bitmap conversion.  A lot of them have suggestions like from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20782713retrievebitmapfromuriRetrieve bitmap from uriap  precode    Uri imageUri  intent.getData     Bitmap bitmap  MediaStore.Images.Media.getBitmapthis.getContentResolver,imageUri     Imageview myimgview  Imageview  findViewById R.id.myimgview     myimgview.setImageBitmapbitmap codepre  pThe Bitmap line is the important line.  Whenever I run my Android app on my simulator, the app crashes debugger in Eclipse confirms in happens on the URI  Bitmap conversion line, and if I put the conversion in different activities it is Bundled, then it still crashes on the Uri  Bitmap conversion line.p  pIm not sure why this is.  Ive tried making my intent both EXTERNALCONTENTURI and INTERNALCONTENTURI on the initial intent, and either choice doesnt matter.  Im going to keep looking for potential solutions to my problem, but Im short on time right now and I feel it would be helpful if I had some advice from outside sources.p  pAnyone know why it always crashes on that line, or if there are any possible solutions to my problem  Thanks.p
Negative 2827 pI have a ScrollView with RelativeLayouts inside that include TextViews. I can only see text that appears at first, but if I scroll hidden elements do not appear I should see the rest of the text when I scroll but I see empty space. Sometimes It shows one line of text just at the end, but only that.p  pI tried viewport  true in ScrollView, I changed the hierarchy... but nothing.p  pDoes anyone know how to solve this Its driving

Negative 2827 pIm trying to figure out how to calculate the shipping refund on orders where some of the items are being refunded.

Negative 2827 pHaving a bit of a mysterious issue with IE11Windows 8.1 and it seems to only affect emsomeem users. I have a font thats generated from fontello.com that works in every browser I can think of, its sweet and bullet proof. All was fine til this past week when I logged into our software and the fontface wasnt loading properly. Ive spent a good chunk of my day searching, googling, and yearning for an answer but Im finding no such luck.p  pHeres what Ive foundp  pThe font works in a staging environment thats....similar to the live environment. Staging is Apache 2.2.25 and live is Apache 2.2.3. In staging, when on IE11 the font pulls through just fine, and the ContentType header comes out as codeapplicationvnd.msfontobjectcode and the font loads fine. On live the fonts are either blankempty or they come through as ChineseJapanese characters and the ContentType comes through as textplain. On another computer Ive tried this out in Windows 8.1IE11 and it worked just fine and the type was still textplain, but on my home computer it still has issues with textplain. I havent had these issues on IE11 with Windows 7 or 8 Ive tested on other computers, but maybe I dont have enough computers to fully test this out. Here are some screenshots for clarification.p  pWhat it should look likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comw8ovw.png altWhat it should look likep  pWhat it looks like in IE11Windows 8.1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comy0gEa.png altWhat it looks like in IE11Windows 8.1p  pHere is the CSS Im using thats generated from Fontello. One other interesting note is IE11 is trying to pull the fontssweeticons.eot303474737448iefix, not the fontssweeticons.eot303474737448. In staging, it will only download fontssweeticons.eot303474737448 but on live it tries to download fontssweeticons.eot303474737448iefix and fontssweeticons.woff303474737448 and fontssweeticons.ttf303474737448, but none of them are working correctly or maybe thats why they arent working correctly. When viewing developer tools, IE11 recognizes all the classes for the font that should be loading, but all the statements are crossed out as if the class is being overridden by a class lower in the file, or by an inline stylep  precodefontface    fontfamily sweeticons   src urlfontssweeticons.eot303574737448   src urlfontssweeticons.eot303474737448iefix formatembeddedopentype,        urlfontssweeticons.woff302374734478 formatwoff,        urlfontssweeticons.ttf303374737448 formattruetype,        urlfontssweeticons.svg303274734478sweeticons formatsvg   fontweight normal   fontstyle normal   [classfa]before, [class fa]before    fontfamily sweeticons   fontstyle normal   fontweight normal   speak none   webkitfontsmoothing antialiased   mozosxfontsmoothing grayscale   display inlineblock   textdecoration inherit   width 1em   marginright .2em   textalign center   fontvariant normal   texttransform none   lineheight 1em   marginleft .2em   [classfa]hover,[class fa]hover     textdecorationnone  codepre  pAnd heres a quick screenshot of the live server and what it tries to dop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfAmWL.png altLive server requestsp  pAnd here some header info for the live eot filep  precodeDate Wed, 24 Sep 2014 174906 GMT   Server Apache2.2.3 Red Hat   LastModified Thu, 18 Sep 2014 203215 GMT   AcceptRanges bytes   Vary AcceptEncoding   ContentEncoding gzip   ContentType textplain charsetUTF8   ContentLength 24212   Connection close  codepre  pAnd also, just to be crystal clear in case you dont notice from the CSS above, this has nothing to do with CORS, or cross domain anything, these are local files hosted directly on the server. I have snooped around on google and the best that I can come up with is to wait and see if another update from Microsoft will fix these issues as it has in the past. I have IE 11.0.9600.17278 and update version 11.0.12. Im stumped so any insight as to a workaround would be great.p  h2Edith2  pSo now that Ive done a little more testing on it, Im thinking this is a server issue I created this test file. a hrefhttpsky9.comie11 relnofollowhttpsky9.comie11a and it works in IE11 all on its own. I copied those exact files to my live server and tested it there, and it does not work. Leads me to believe there is an issue with Apache 2.2.3 somewhere along the lines Etags are turned off for EOT files and they are gzipd... I just tried gziping the file on sky9 and it still came through just fine.p  pAlso, just to point out that the sky9.com Apache version is 2.2.15p

So if there is nobody playing with my kiosk device and some amount of time passes, the screen goes off and it should display my activity on the screen.

Negative 2827 pI have successfully migrated a SVN repo to GIT few weeks back, but we didnt migrate all the revisions, say we had 10 revisions in all, we needed until revision 6 only back then. Now we want to get the remaining revisions i.e 7 to 10, with commit history details. I tried cloning usingp  precodegit svn clone A authorstransform.txt r7HEAD url . codepre  pwhich gets all the changes but when i try to merge it into local branch, the changes are in the working copy and i have to manually merge as a single commit instead of n different commits which i am not in favor of since i want to retain the original commit messages and dates. Are there any alternative ways to achieve thisp  pthanksp

Negative 2827 pIve assigned a static IP address to my computer. From my computer, when I browse to a hrefhttpwww.whatismyip.com relnofollowWhatIsMyIPa, I can check my IP amp verify that it hasnt changed.p  pNow, when I ping my computer from another network, most of the times, everything is fine amp I get responses but occasionally I get Request Timed Out messages 4 out of 4 attempts onp  precodeCMDgt ping ltIPgt codepre  pwill result in the request timing out. p  pSo far, I have not been able to identify why sometimes it works, but times out at other times. At the times it has timed out, Ive used a hrefhttpwww.teamviewer.comenindex.aspx relnofollow titleTeamViewerTeamViewera to connect to my computer amp check a hrefhttpwww.whatismyip.com relnofollowWhatIsMyIPa to verify that its the same. So I know its connected amp online amp everything is accessible from the computer atleast.p  pNormally this would not be a problem, but Im trying to host a small website form my computer amp for the most part, its online, but now amp then it goes offline  even though the host computer is up amp running with no change in its IP address.p  pIm on Google Fiber, if that helps. Also, under the Advanced Settings, I have reserved an IP address 192.168.1.4 for my computer so I know that will not change. And as Ive mentioned my outward facing IP has been made static so I know that is always the same.p  pAnother thing to mention, I have never faced any problems when browsing, gaming online No disconnects or timeouts or anythingp  pI would like some insight as to how this can be resolved or at the very least, if the root cause can be identified.p

Negative 2827 pIm calling an executable from within  a c program via the system command. Although each call is successful, I run into problems when the c code calls the executable many times while running. At that point, the executable takes a lot longer to run than it is supposed to.p  pI should add that the c code where the executable is called from is an optimisation routine. Yet, the executable is only called sequentially. After it finishes the c code continues to the next iteration and calls the executable once again with another set of parameters.p  pAre there any restrictions behind the system command that might be generating this Is there a maximum number of times you can call it in a short time intervalp  pThank you for your help.p  pMDR.p

Negative 2827 pI am working with the awsome MPandroidChart opensource library and i am populating the chart live from data i am receiving online, when populating the chart with new values,  I allow only a specific amount of x index to be visible, using setVisibleXRange and moveViewToX to slide the chart to the left of the screen, displaying only the last entries at a time.p  pthis all works great but I want to achieve a situation where the view port is modified to fit exactly the highest and lowest visible values, same as fitScreen but that modifies the Y axis only. zoomOut and zoomIn are using relative inputs, same as zoom so i cannot use them based on my data. what i need is a way to position the view on the Y axis so the it fits different ranges at each cycle, for example 2 to 15 or 98 to 34 an so on.p  pdoes anyone have any ideas on how this could be done appreciate all answers.

Negative 2827 pIm working on setting up a new MVC payment site with a dependencyinjected database connection in a separate project, and experimenting with some new things as I do.  Currently, Im trying to load an existing transaction from the database, authorize the card payment, and then save the result back to the database.  Simple and straightforward, but when I call codeSaveChangescode, nothing gets saved, and Ive run out of things to try.p  pThe database interaction for this is handled by a codeCheckoutDataProvidercodep  precodepublic class CheckoutDataProvider  ICheckoutDataProvider      private readonly CheckoutEntities context      public CheckoutDataProviderCheckoutEntities context              this.context  context             public ITransaction GetTransactionDetailsGuid transactionId              var trans  context.Transactions.FirstOrDefaultx gt x.CheckoutTransactionId  transactionId         return trans  Its OK if trans  null, because the caller will expect that.            public void AddAuthorizationITransaction  transaction, IAuthorizationHistory history              try                      var trans  Transactiontransaction             var hist  AuthorizationHistoryhistory             trans.AuthorizationHistories.Addhist             context.SaveChanges                  catch DbEntityValidationException ex                      throw new InvalidDataExceptionex.EntityValidationErrors.First.ValidationErrors.First.ErrorMessage, ex                codepre  pcodeTransactioncode and codeAuthorizationHistorycode are EF objects and correspond directly to the database tables.  codeCheckoutEntitiescode is the context, as injected by Ninject.  p  pcodeGetTransactionDetailscode works flawlessly.  I give it the transactionId, I get the object, and then I use that data to run the card and generate the codeAuthorizationHistorycode class.  Then I call codeAddAuthorizationcode to attach it to the transaction and save it to the database.  But both the new codeAuthorizationHistorycode object and any changes to the original codeTransactioncode fail to save.  p  pI can tell from inspecting the codecontextcode object that its not aware of any changes, and if I make changes withing codeGetTransactionDetailscode before it gets returned as an interface they emwillem persist.  So it looks like a problem with the casting which makes me feel icky anyway, so Id love to find out that thats the problem.p  pAm I missing something obvious  Is there something missing to get this to work  Is there a way to avoid the casting in codeAddAuthorizationcodep

Its in a thumbnail file, so I can read it into memory and display it. However I know that the JList rerenders every time the window moves or the window needs redrawn which is emreally badem for performance and just not good design. The issue I have is that this list is dynamic so I cannot simply load all images at startup because users can add them at runtime and itll auto update the list.p  pSome people mentioned loading the image into memory in the constructor and setting it in the codegetListCellRendererComponentcode method but that doesnt appear to be possible because it only creates one cell renderer and uses it for everything in the list. I also verified this by printing out the constructor method. Since I will have a list of frogs with all different images this doesnt really make sense.p  pHere is the code I am using to create the thumbnail right now.p  precodepublic Image createListThumbnail      try          Image returnImg  null         get latest frog image         SiteImage img  frog.getLatestImage         BufferedImage src  ImageIO.readnew FileXMLFrogDatabase.getImagesFolderimg.getImageFileName         BufferedImage thumbnail  Scalr.resizesrc, Scalr.Method.SPEED, Scalr.Mode.FITTOWIDTH, 200, 150, Scalr.OPANTIALIAS         if frog.isFullySearchable             ImageFilter filter  new GrayFiltertrue, 30               ImageProducer producer  new FilteredImageSourcethumbnail.getSource, filter               returnImg  Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit.createImageproducer                    return returnImg      catch IOException e          IdentiFrog.LOGGER.writeExceptionWithMessageUnable to generate thumbnail for image in memory., e          return null  codepre  pI call this method in my codegetListCellRendererComponentcode which I know causes terrible performance but I dont understand how to cache it in memory for multiple frogs and also use only one object. Perhaps an image map I cant seem to find any solid evidence of a proper way to do this.p

Even in my compiler it says that this casting is Redundant and i dont understand why, as far as i know it should treat the object like its from the codeMusiciancode class and it doesnt.p  pSecond, i would like to know how come that in the codeprintInfocode method on the first line it calls the codeplaycode function, and it calls the codeplaycode function of the object class instead of stick with the codeplaycode function of the codeMusiciancode class... Ill explain myself, since the codegetInfocode class is found only in the super codeMusiciancode class it will always go to that method, never mind what was the class of the object that called it. So if Ill have a codeRockMusiciancode object it will activate the codeMusiciancode codegetInfocode method, but in the first line when it will try to call the codeplaycode method it knows that the object that called it was indeed a codeRockMusiciancode, even if Im calling it from a codeMusiciancode method.p  pHope i was clear enough, Im not that new to OOP, but Im new to Java, and i dont really understand how it works under the hood...p  pHope you could help me, Thanksp

Negative 2827 pI am writing a JSON class for C11, see a hrefhttpgithub.comnlohmannjson relnofollowhttpgithub.comnlohmannjsona. My central data structure is a class wrapping the JSON value types null, array, object, string, bool, number in a union and offering it in via a nice C and STLlike interface. The types for the values can be set via template parameters and default to codestdvectorcode for arrays, codestdmapcode for objects, codestdstringcode for strings, codeboolcode for booleans, codeint64tcode for integer numbers, and codedoublecode for floatingtype numbers.p  pTo support the concept of an a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppconceptAllocatorAwareContainer relnofollowAllocatorAwareContainera, I also allowed to pass an allocator type which defaults to codestdallocatorcode. As the array, object, and string types are stored with pointers in my union, I use this allocator to allocate memory for these types.p  pSo far, so good see a hrefhttpsgithub.comnlohmannjsonblobmastersrcjson.hpp relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnlohmannjsonblobmastersrcjson.hppa for the complete source code...p  pNow my question is whether it makes sense to pass an allocator which is then implicitly used for the types array, object, and string. Alternatively, I could customize the allocator by passing an allocator with the concrete type codestdmapcode, codestdvectorcode, and codestdstringcode. Then, however, I need to be able to specify this specialization, because currently, my class uses the following definition for the templatesp  precodetemplate lt     templatelttypename U, typename V, typename... Argsgt class ObjectType  stdmap,     templatelttypename U, typename...

Even worse, codeObjectTypecode should be a mapping from codeStringTypecode to codebasicjsoncode. The code shown here and completely found here a hrefhttpsgithub.comnlohmannjsonblobmastersrcjson.hpp relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnlohmannjsonblobmastersrcjson.hppa compiles and is fine, but I have no idea how to allow to specify an allocator per type rather than for the whole class.p  pAny ideasp

Unauthorized IPs are redirected to kick them out.p  pHow can my customer pass the user ID aka the email in my case from his Intranet to my web site, in such a way that it is securep  pHere are my concerns about being secure A is the user ID is passed as a parameter to my web site for example as part of the query string in the url or as a hidden input field in a form in a POST call, then there is the danger of anyone in that intranet altering this user ID by anyone elses user ID and entering as them. For example, if I am joeabc.com, then joeabc.com would be passed somehow from the intranet to the site as a parameter. I could easily make a change from joeabc.com to daveabc.com which would then log me in the site as daveabc.com.p  pB lets say that the user ID is then encrypted. So, now joeabc.com becomes something like AAABBB000111. If I share this encrypted value with anyone, then this person could use the encrypted value and login as me. Of course I would have to share this encrypted value with him.p  pSo, do you think that there is a good and elegant way to accomplish passing the user ID from the intranet to the external site in a secure way   p
Negative 2827 pI have trouble grabbing some info from an Intent.

When I come back to dialog B from A or C the keyboard starts popping up when i swipe on the HTML content. p  pHTML content is a touch based content.p  pI am assuming that the code for hiding keyboard is not executed every time the dialog is opened. p  pI have tried SOFTINPUTSTATEALWAYSHIDDEN and SOFTINPUTSTATEHIDDEN.p  pEDIT  If I opened google on the web view which has a text field for search. key board does not popup when I touch the edit text which is good even though i navigate. But when I try to scroll up and down on the page the keyboard pops up and disappearsHappens from the second visit to the dialog. p  pCould you please share your thoughts on how to hide the keyboard every time I open this dialog B.p  precodeOverride Deprecated protected Dialog onCreateDialogint id      AlertDialog.Builder builder  new AlertDialog.Builderthis,R.style.AlertDialogCustom     final  Boolean pinVerficationDialogPopedUp  loginData.getBooleanpinVerficationDialogPopedUp,             false      if pinVerficationDialogPopedUp  false          switch id              case DIALOGADDAPERSONBODYMAP              try                      LayoutInflater inflaterBodyMap  this                             .getLayoutInflater                     final View inflatorBodyMap  inflaterBodyMap                             .inflate                                     R.layout.dialogincidentwindowbodymap,                                     null                     bodyMapWebView   WebView inflatorBodyMap.findViewByIdR.id.webView                      bodyMapWebView.getSettings.setJavaScriptEnabledtrue                     bodyMapWebView.getSettings.setBuiltInZoomControlstrue                     bodyMapWebView.getSettings.setSupportZoomtrue                                           Trying to resolve issue where sometimes when the HTML page loads, it does                     not load the whole content                                           bodyMapWebView.postnew Runnable                          Override                         public void run                              bodyMapWebView.loadUrlfileandroidassetbodyMap.html                                                                    bodyMapWebView.addJavascriptInterfacenew WebAppInterfacethis, Android                     builder.setTitleInjured person                     builder.setViewinflatorBodyMap                     builder.setPositiveButtonNext,                             new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                                  Override                                 public void onClickDialogInterface dialog,                                                     int which                                                      next dialog                                                                                     builder.setNegativeButtonBack,                             new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                                  Override                                 public void onClickDialogInterface dialog,                                                     int which                                     previous dialog                                                                                    alertBodyMap  builder.create                     alertBodyMap.getWindow.setSoftInputModeWindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFTINPUTSTATEHIDDEN                     alertBodyMap.show                     return dialog                  catch Exception e                      e.printStackTrace                                                   return dialog          codepre  pYour help much appreciated.

Negative 2827 pWhat is the current, canonical approach to proximity alerts for numerous locations on Androidp  pIm working on an app that needs to notify users about deals near them as they go through their daily activities.p  pI have tried activity recognition to develop a formula for when to check for deals but it was hugely unpredictable.  It rarely executed as it should.  So I dropped down to simple location monitoring, but even that seems to be triggered unpredictably and optimizing the search radius is difficult.p  pThere are some apps that seem to very effectively notify you when you get very close to a store  they do so consistently and without error.  What approach do they take to ensure this qualityp
Negative 2827 pI have to serialize a Json using Avro in Node.js. For this I used a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.compackagenodeavroio relnofollownodeavroioa package using help from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22935558serializingdatawithavroinnodejsthis stackoverflow linka. But the serialized data using this contains schema with each serialized Json. Is there a way I could do it without adding schema to each serialized JSON. In Java I was able to achieve it by directly operating upon Datum Writer.p
Negative 2827 pAs stated in the title, Im trying to determine if a drive DVD drive or a CD drive.  Again, I am not asking about the media, Im asking about the actual drive itself... the object pointed to by a DriveInfo class.p  pIm thinking the DriveInfo class isnt enough and Ill instead have to get the Win32DiskDrive instance from WMI and dig around in there. The problem is all the samples Ive found so far talk about the detected media, but a DVD drive can use CD media so that isnt sufficient. Plus, the code should work regardless if media is present or not.p
