Positive 106940 pOk, so I thought I understood this, but it seems I dont have complete understanding of it.p  pIve just created an app on my local machine. I had a local code.envcode file storing my local environment variables. I understand that when you commit the app to the server with git, the code.envcode file isnt pushed, and that you should set the environment values on the server.p  pWell, Im using DigitalOcean, and I have created a new virtual host file, and set the environment variables in there using the codeSetEnv APPENV localcode syntax.p  pWhen I access the site through the browser, I know its picking up the env values because I get an error message saying that the base table isnt found, and the database name is what is set in my environment variables. This is fine, because I havent run migrations yet.p  pHowever, When I ssh into the server, and run codephp artisan migratecode, it appears to not be picking up the Env values. I assume this is because artisan is not running through an apache virtual host.p  pDoes this mean I need to create a code.envcode file which will store my database details etc If so, whats the point in setting the environment variables in the virtual host file, and not just have a single code.envcode file By setting values in the Virtual Host config file, and also a code.envcode file, Im duplicating environment variables, which is surely bad practicep  pIf I shouldnt create another code.envcode file for the server, how do I specify the environment values to use within artisanp  pI hope I explained the question well enough, but if I havent, or I need to clear something up, please ask.p

Positive 106940 pI am trying to hack up a multi tenancy multi database application using laravel. After going through a lot of articles on the web, I now understand that there are different approaches to the database architecture.p  ol liTo have a single database and have codetenantidcode foreign key to separate the tenant recordsli liTo have multiple databases to separate each tenants datali ol  pThe project I am working on requires that every tenant has his own database for security purposes. Now I am trying to manually hack up a Laravel 5 installation to achieve this but I am not a pro and I am seeing some setbacks.p  pSo I started with creating the migration for the main DB which will store all the tenants. I created this migration in a folder called codemaincode under the migrations folder. The schema looks like sop  precodeSchemacreatetenants, function Blueprint table      tablegtincrementsid     tablegtstringname     tablegttextdescription     tablegtstringlogo     tablegtstringusername     tablegttimestamps  codepre  pThen I went ahead and created the migrations files for the tenant databases and I placed them in the codetenantscode folder inside the migrations folder. The schema looks like sop  pUsers Tablep  precodeSchemacreateusers, function Blueprint table      tablegtincrementsid     tablegttimestamps  codepre  pRoles Tablep  precodeSchemacreateroles, function Blueprint table      tablegtincrementsid     tablegtstingname     tablegttimestamps  codepre  pAnd a pivot between the twop  precodeSchemacreateroleuser, function Blueprint table      tablegtincrementsid     tablegtintegerroleidgtunsigned     tablegtforeignroleidgtreferncesidgtonroles     tablegtintegeruseridgtunsigned     tablegtforeignuseridgtreferncesidgtonusers     tablegttimestamps  codepre  pAt this point I started with a seed files which would create multiple fake tenants and then for each tenant run the migration to create the tenants database. The seed file looks like sop  precodepublic function run      faker  Fakercreate       Fetching all tenants     tenants  AppTenantall       Deleting their databases     tenantsgteachfunctiontenant         DBstatementDROP DATABASE IF EXISTS  . tenantgtusername         DBstatementDROP USER IF EXISTS  . tenantgtusername            Truncating the tenants table itself     DBtabletenantsgttruncate      fori  0 i lt 3 i         company  fakergtcompany         description  fakergttext         logo  fakergtimageUrl50, 50         username  strrandom20          Tenantcreate[             name          gt company,             description   gt description,             logo          gt logo,             username      gt username,         ]           Creating a new user by the username of the tenant          Also giving him privileges on the database by the same name         DBstatementCREATE USER  . username . localhost IDENTIFIED BY admin12345         DBstatementGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON .

So is storing the password in the main database a good idea I mean I can encrypt and store it and then when I need to connect to the DB, I can take the username of the tenant and the decrypted password to connect to the DB. Is this a good approachp  pOther than this I am also confused on how to connect to a DB dynamically and run the migrations for the tenant tables. I know I can call artisan commands to run migrations but how to connect to the DB firstp  pI am also confused as how to go about checking which user is logged in. I mean every tenant has its own users. So when a user is logging in, I am also asking then their tenant username so that I know which database to connect to and then authenticate them to the users table in it.p  pBut again I am confused that if I am even on the right track with this approachp  pSo my main problem right now is to connect to a different database dynamically. How do I go about doing thatp

Negative 106940 pSo I have a form that uses infopath services via sharepoint, and after multiple attempts at attempting to fix a rendering problem tables appear WAY too wide to be readable, I think I have found the problem  date controls.p  pIt seems date controls within Infopath 2007 screw with rendering somehow.

Negative 106940 pWe have a Java Applet built using AWT. This applet lets you select pictures from your hard drive and upload them to a server. The applet includes a scrollable list of pictures, which works fine in Windows, Linux and Mac OS X 10.5. We launch this applet via Java Web Start or within a web page. p  pOur applet does not behave properly in Mac OS X 10.4, regardless of the version of Java 1.4 or 1.5. You can find a screenshot of the incorrect behaviour, when scrolling, herep  pa hrefhttpwww.lavablast.comtmpuierror.png relnofollowhttpwww.lavablast.comtmpuierror.pngap  pSimply put, sometimes when scrolling the pictures end up overlapping the header or footer of the application. This behaviour does not occur on other platforms. On Mac OS X 10.4, it shows the pictures in the incorrect location when scrolling, which would not be so bad if it refreshed the screen after painting the image at that location. However, it does not appear that the application knows it painted it incorrectly and thus does not refresh.p  pIf the window is minimized, resized or even moved, the application is refreshed and the incorrectly positioned elements vanish and the application resumes normally. I spent quite some time trying to force a refresh of the background image unsuccessfully. the repaint the image directly, repaint all children of a few panels, etc.  Thus, I am looking for any tips that would help me  resolve this problem under Mac OS X 10.4 or, in the worst case, simply simulate a full applet refresh. p  pUntil recently, everything was compatible with Java 1.1 but this has changed in a few locations which now require 1.4. I dont feel these changes created the issue, I am just providing this as extra information. If you are interested in implementation details of the scroll panel, I will investigate, but I am assuming this is a common platform bug for which workarounds must be known.p  pTo replicate the problem, open the following Java Web Start application a hrefhttpwww.lavablast.comtmpopalwebstart.php.jnlp relnofollowhttpwww.lavablast.comtmpopalwebstart.php.jnlpap  pSelect a folder containing lots of images and play with the scrollbar. At some point fairly quickly, you should get the refresh problem. p  pEdit I followed the first suggestion here and replaced all my controls that feature background images with a Swing equivalent and the issue is still there. Plus, there are numerous other fixes I would need to do to do a complete change. Any other ideas A simple one line of code that forces a full refresh would be great p  pEdit2 The main thread creates the panels and launches X threads. Using an observernotifier pattern, the threads complete and notify the main control, which adds a panel to the page. This is done via an EventQueue.invokeLater which, unless I am mistaken, should run on the right thread. The issue is at its most severe when scrolling even if no extra threads are running as during the loading.  p

Negative 106940 pI have a Python interface of a graph library written in C  igraph the name of library. My need is to invoke the python modules pertaining to this graph library from Java code. It goes like this, the core of library is in c. This core has been imported into Python and interfaces to the functions embedded in core are available in Python. My projects rest of the code is in Java and hence I would like to call the graph functions by Java as well. Jython  which lets you invoke python modules with in Java was an option.I went on trying Jython to discover that it will not work in my case as the core code is in C and Jython wont support anything that is imported as a c dll in python code.I also thought of opting for the approach of calling graph routines directly in c. That is without passing through Python code. I am assuming there must be something which lets you call c code from Java, how ever I am not good in C hence I did not go for it. My last resort seems to execute Python interpreter from command line using Java. But that is a dirty and shameless. Also to deal with the results produced by Python code I will have to write the results in a file and read it back in java. Again dirty way.

Negative 106940 pIm writing an application in Python 2.6 that requires me to use a dictionary as a data store.p  pI am curious as to whether or not it is more memory efficient to have one large dictionary, or to break that down into many much smaller dictionaries, then have an index dictionary that contains a reference to all the smaller dictionaries.p  pI know there is a lot of overhead in general with lists and dictionaries. I read somewhere that python internally allocates enough space that the dictionarylist  of items to the power of 2.p  pIm new enough to python that Im not sure if there are other unexpected internal complexitiessuprises like that, that is not apparent to the average user that I should take into consideration.p  pOne of the difficulties is knowing how the power of 2 system counts items Is each keypair counted as 1 item Thats seems important to know because if you have a 100 item monolithic dictionary then space 1002 items would be allocated. If you have 100 single item dictionaries 1 keypair then each dictionary would only be allocation 12 aka no extra allocationp  pAny clearly laid out information would be very helpfulp

Negative 106940 pReport design, generation and maintenance isnt hard, but it is dull. We have a number of legacy to quite different degrees of legacy reports in Crystal Reports XI. These are designed for A4PDF  not necessarily printed, but to be of a predictable layout and theres no possibility of us retiring them any time soon. p  pAll connect to existing stored procedures SQL Server 2005 to acquire their data. A lot of time has been sunk in getting these reports to look emjust soem. The actual creation of reports is mostly done via the .NETC API and exported to PDF. There are a number of locally developed and maintained applications that are stable and handle this process well. p  pSo we like the fact that Crystal Reports is stable, that our apps produce these reports reliably, that the PDF output is consistent and that when the Crystal Reports template is approved and set, it just works. p  pThere are some big problems with this situation though. The biggest being that any changes to the underlying report templates themselves are a huge pain getting the Crystal Reports template to a point that users are happy is a royal hassle and can involve a long iteration of DTPgraphicsdatabasereconciliation and myriad other niggles. p  pCombine that with Crystal Reports being a relatively rare skill and not one people want to admit to, we are trying to think up alternative solutions. p  pSome thoughts Ive started to consider  and any others welcome p  ul liDoes Crystal Reports 2008 offer any benefits over XI li liHow have others managed a migration away from CR And what to li liGiven the data access layer is well formed, perhaps generate graphs via an Excel service and then import them as graphics to a framework template Crystal, another  has anyone tried anything like this li liIs Reporting Services any better We have some RS skillz but again, another thing that people are loath to actually own up to knowing anything about. li liAre there any layout tools available preferably with a .NET API for what, in the old days, would be called Desktop Publishing If we have graphicstablesother objects as images that could then be rendering automatically,  li ul  pIdeally I want to move to a solution where the users are in greater control of the underlying changes, and whether this can be handled programatically within tools that we can provide to them and so that I can be coding rather than editing Crystal Reports templates. p

Negative 106940 pI need to implement a custom handler for MVC that gives me the first look at URLs requests to determine if it should rewrite the urls before submitting the URL to the routing engine. Any pattern is a candidate for the redirect, so I need to intercept the URL request before the standard MVC routing engine takes a look at it. p  pAfter looking at a whole bunch of examples, blogs, articles, etc. of implementing custom routing for ASP.NET MVC, I still havent found a usecase that fits my scenario. We have an existing implementation for ASP.NET that works fine, but were returning the standard handler when no overrides are matched.

Negative 106940 pFirst to describe the problem During a relayout due to a change in width or height, Javas ScrollPaneLayout requests the preferredSize of its children BEFORE setting the bounds of its viewport. On TextComponents calling getPreferredSpan can change the layout since this getPreferredSpan calls setSize internally. The effect is, that no view extending javax.swing.text.View can for sure retrieve the real size of its parent Component in this situation. A getVisibleRect will fail in this situate as the bounds of the viewport are not yet set. Checking the validity of the text component to block the layout process is not an option as it is already valiid in this scenario.p  pSo, the question is is there a possibility to find out, whether the bounds of a JComponent are up to datep

Negative 106940 pIm trying to find out how to programmatically i.e. without using the codeFieldAttributecode add an index column for NHibernate Search Lucene.net.p  pIm having inheritance issues due to the fact that the codeFieldAttributecode is not automatically inherited.p  pThe following code illustrates what I want to do. p  precodeclass A      [FieldIndex.Tokenized]     public virtual string P1              get                      return P1                 class B  A      public override string P1              get                      return P1                codepre  pI expected the override of P1 to be indexed but it didnt. When I inspected the codeFieldAttributecode class, I found that it didnt have codeInherited  truecode specified in the codeAttributeUsagecode attribute.p  pI then added a codeFieldAttributecode to the overridden property but that resulted in NHibernate Search bailing out with an exception stating that an item with the same key has already been added to a dictionary.

Negative 106940 pI understand the differences between CHAR and VARCHAR, one being fixedlength and the other variablelength, and that if all fields in a row are fixedlength, a table will generally perform better.p  pHowever, something that is unclear to me is that if I give VARCHAR a length, such as VARCHAR500, does this retain the row as fixedlengthp  pFor context, I have clean table with 50 columns, mostly TINYINTs, but I need two columns in this table as VARCHAR, as they will need store up to 500 characters each. The exact length is subject to user input and therefore unknown.p  pAs an additional qualification, I dont really want to put these VARCHAR fields into a separate referenced table as it produces unnecessary joins and doesnt fit the expected query patterns very efficiently.p  pAny help would be appreciated.

Negative 106940 pWe are planning to implement a system for logging a high frequency of market ticks into a DB for further analysis. To simply get a little what kind of storage performance we can get on the different DB solutions I created a little application for inserting a basic row of tick information.

When actually implementing a solution we would of course do buffering, bulk inserts etc.p  pWe only care about the speed of the inserts, as the querying is done offline later.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions for other databases that could fit I will be trying with HDF5 and MonetDB later tonight too. Its required to have multi client access.p  pThanks for any suggestionsp  pUPDATED  p  pSorry, but i did a major edit of my question before positing, and it seems i left out the server versions and some details of the hardware. All tests were on an 8 core server with 12GB RAM running Windows 2008 x64.p  pMicrosoft SQL Server 2008 Enterprise x64. MySQL 5.1.44 running as InnoDB table. MongoDB 1.2.4 x64p  pThe current test is a simple loop of row inserts into the DBs with real historic data from NASDAQ compiled in a CSV file already imported to memory. The code was in C NET4 x64.p  pThe MS SQL and MySQL servers were tuned to perfect settings, while the MongoDB was just set up with defaults. The SQL tables are set up with no indices, as the purpose of the DB is simple as a staging ground before being transfered into the main analysis system.p  pMany suggested Bulk inserts, however its a difficult way of doing it as we have several clients pushing single ticks into the DB independently from live streams. To allow for such methods, we would have to expand the layer in front of the DB beyond what we have a chance to test for right now. However I imagine something will have to be done for the final architecture, as the numbers we are getting from everything except the MongoDB is not enough to handle the number of inputs needed.p  pUPDATE 2 SSD drives are indeed great for just this, and we are using this ourselves. However the final product will be installed at a few different customers which all provide their own iron.. and getting servers from the IT department with SSD is still hard... p  pUPDATE 3 p  pI tried the BulkCopy approach suggested. Performance for the same loop as the others, but first into a DataTable and then BulkInsert into the SQL Server resulted in the following p  pstrongMicrosoft SQL Server Bulk strongp  pTotal test time  2 seconds. 39401 prices per second.p

Negative 106940 pI have a C library that should expose some system resource calls as callbacks from the linked application. For example the interfacing application which uses this library can send socket management callback functions  send, receive, open, close etc., and the library will use this implementation in stead of the librarys implementation. This way enables the application to manage the sockets by itself, can be useful. This library has to expose also more callbacks, like, for example, a password validation, so I wonder if there is a preferred method to expose the callback sending option in one API. Something likep  precodeint AddCallbackFunc int functionCallbackType, ltgeneric function prototypegt, ltgeneric way to pass some additional argumentsgt codepre  pThen within my library I will assign the callback to the appropriate function pointer according to the functionCallbackType parameter.p  pIs there any way to implement it in a generic way which will fit ANY function prototype and ANY additional argumentsp  pYour help will be more than appreciated...

Negative 106940 pTo summarize the issue Im encountering, I have an EJB which uses version A of a library lets call it depvA.jar. depvA.jar is packaged in the root of the EJBs jar file. The domain lib folder in the application server contains version B of the same library lets call it depvB.jar. When calling the EJB, I get an error due to depvB.jar file being loaded rather than depvA.jar. p  pI guess the first part of this question is, does Sun One Application Server v9.1 isolate EJBs from each other I was under the impression that it does. But it seems like another application loaded depvB.jar and this EJB is directly using it without loading its own. p  pThe second question is, if the app server does isolate EJBs, does it load dependencies from the EJBs jar file before looking in the application servers lib folders I was under the impression that this is also true, but maybe not...p  pIs anyone familiar enough with Sun application servers to explain why depvB.jar is being loaded rather than depvA.jar Is there any way to get it to load depvA.jar without changing whats in the application servers lib folders I would hesitate to do anything that might affect other applications on the serverp  pThanks.p

Negative 106940 pI am implementing a web server API for my application, and I got stuck in the process of figuring out what authentication method I should use to authenticate requests by the users and also by other client applications. I think that I did not really understand what OAuth and other authentication protocols are made for.p  pI want the authentication to be performed without the intervention of a web browser, entirely from my iPhone app, or another custom thirdparty client. Is sessionbased authentication the good way to go here How does for example the Facebook iPhone client authenticates itself with the web API I dont think it uses OAuth or anything like that, since touch loginauthorization form is never displayed. OAuth is, as far as I know, used only for thirdparty apps. But why is that so Couldnt the iPhone client be considered a thirdparty app toop  pI am sorry if my questions are vague and unclear, please point me out with the details that are missing and such. Thank you.p

Negative 106940 pHI Allp  pI was hoping someone could help me improve a query I have to run periodically. At the moment it takes more than 40 minutes to execute. It uses the full allocated memory during this time, but CPU usage mostly meanders at 2  5, every now and then jumping to 40 for a few seconds.p  pI have this table simplified examplep  precode    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[dataTable]          [ID] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,     [dteEffectiveDate] [date] NULL,     [dtePrevious] [date] NULL,     [dteNext] [date] NULL,     [Age] [int] NULL,     [Count] [int] NULL      ON [PRIMARY]      GO codepre  pHere are some input valuesp  precodeINSERT INTO [YourDB].[dbo].[dataTable]            [dteEffectiveDate]            ,[dtePrevious]            ,[dteNext]            ,[Age]            ,[Count]      VALUES 20090101,NULL,20100101,40,300, 20100101,20090101, NULL,40,200, 20090101,NULL, 20100101,20,100, 20100101,20090101, NULL,20,50, 20090101,NULL,20100101,30,10 GO codepre  pEach entry has a dteEffectiveDate field. In addition, each has a dtePrevious and dteNext, which reflects the dates of the nearest previousnext effective date. Now what I want is a query that will calculate the midvalue on the Count fields between successive periods, within a specific age.p  pSo for example, in the data above, for age 40 we have 300 at 20090101 and 200 at 20100101 so the query should produce 250.p  pNote that age 30 has only one entry, 10. This is at 20090101. There is no entry at 20100101, but we know that data was captured at this point, so the fact that there is nothing means that 30 is 0 at this date. Hence the query should produce 5.p  pIn order to achieve this I use a FULL JOIN of the table on itself, and use ISNULL to select values. Here is my codep  precodeSELECT      ISNULLT1.dteEffectiveDate,T2.dtePrevious as [Start Date]     ,ISNULLT1.dteNext,T2.dteEffectiveDate  as [End Date]     ,ISNULLT1.Age,T2.Age as Age      ,ISNULLT1.[Count],0 as [Count Start]     ,ISNULLT2.[Count],0   as [Count End]     ,ISNULLT1.[Count],0ISNULLT2.[Count],02 as [Mid Count]      FROM     [ExpDBClient].[dbo].[dataTable] as T1     FULL JOIN [ExpDBClient].[dbo].[dataTable] as T2      ON      T2.dteEffectiveDate  T1.dteNext     AND T2.Age  T1.Age      WHERE ISNULLT1.dteEffectiveDate,T2.dtePrevious is not null     AND ISNULLT1.dteNext,T2.dteEffectiveDate is not null  GO codepre  pwhich outputsp  precodeStart Date  End Date    Age Count Start Count End   Mid Lives 20090101  20100101  40  300         200         250 20090101  20100101  20  100         50          75 20090101  20100101  30  10          0           5 codepre  pIt works perfectly, but when I run this on the actual data, which is about 7m records, it takes painfully long to execute.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestionsp  pThanksbr Karlp

Negative 106940 pIve been playing around with the Reactive Extensions RX in Windows Phone 7 and am very close to a working solution but got caught up on one small detail. I am trying to process the raw touch events using a hrefhttpwww.wintellect.comCSblogsjprosisearchive20110114buildingtouchinterfacesforwindowsphonespart2.aspx relnofollowTouch.FrameReporteda and codeObservable.FromEventcode a bit of an educational quest to learn the Touch API and RX better, but I only want to process the events under certain conditions. For example I may want to filter the subscription to the touch down and touch up events only when a specific page is selected in a pivot control, but it could be any arbitrary condition that changes back and forth between true and false. Since the condition is a value that changes over time it feels like it should be another observable that gets merged with the touch event stream, but I cant for the life of me figure out how to do that.p  pInstead I have a semiworking solution using the codeTakeWhilecode and codeSkipUntilcode extensions for IObservable. I have a stream that receives all the touch events for the whole app codeoTouchAppcode, a second stream that only takes items while my filtering condition is true codeoTouchPagecode, and then two other streams that filter the touches into touch down codeoTouchDowncode and touch up codeoTouchDowncode actions. All of these streams are of type codeIObservableltIEventltTouchFrameEventArgsgtgtcode, so they can easily be merged and compared to create custom gestures. The problem is that I cant get the the oTouchPage stream to restart once the filter condition changes from true to false. Id have to manually recreate the stream, where as I would prefer that it somehow toggles itself between on and off.p  pHere is the code I have so far. Any help on how to filter a stream using a boolean value like an onoff switch would be greatly appreciated.p  precodevar oTouchApp  Observable.FromEventltTouchFrameEventHandler, TouchFrameEventArgsgtx gt new TouchFrameEventHandlerx, ev gt Touch.FrameReported  ev, ev gt Touch.FrameReported  ev This stops working after TestCondition goes from True to False var oTouchPage  oTouchApp.SkipWhilex gt TestCondition  False.TakeWhilex gt TestCondition  True var oTouchDown  from t in oTouchPage                  let primarypoint  t.EventArgs.GetPrimaryTouchPointthis                  where primarypoint.Action  TouchAction.Up                  select t var oTouchUp  from t in oTouchPage                let primarypoint  t.EventArgs.GetPrimaryTouchPointthis                where primarypoint.Action  TouchAction.Down                select t Code for testing var sub1  oTouchPage.Subscribex gtDebug.WriteLineTouchPage var sub2  oTouchDown.Subscribex gtDebug.WriteLineTouchDown var sub3  oTouchUp.Subscribex gtDebug.WriteLineTouchUp codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong Turns out all I needed was to add a simple where clause to the oTouchPage stream codevar oTouchPage  oTouchApp.Wherex gt TestCondition  Truecode  It may not be the best solution, since the TestCondition is evaluated each time an item is produced, but it works well and is easy to read. If the test condition was based on events or some other condition that was easy to convert into an IObservable, then I think the Window or SelectMany approaches mentioned below might be better, but then you may have to deal with a Stream of streams. Im fighting that right now in a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4841635howtousethenewbufferwithtimeorcountinrxthatreturnsiobservableiobservabrelated questiona. p

Negative 106940 pIIS supports two types of compression strongstaticstrong content compression and strongdynamicstrong content compression. According to strongapplicationHost.configstrong, they are handled by different modules DynamicCompressionModule compdyn.dll and StaticCompressionModule compstat.dll, and they are configured to compress strongdifferent types of requestsstrong. Also, Im guessing that the dynamic compression does not cache the compressed requests as opposed the static compression by default, the compressed files are saved to codeSystemDriveinetpubtempIIS Temporary Compressed Filescode.p  pemHowever, besides those obvious differences, I suspect that there is something else.em I think that they hook to the IIS pipeline to a slightly different way. Would anybody have an inside into the some more detailsp  pThe way I found out was that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5609479customiismoduleconflictingwithgzipI was toying with a custom module for modifying CSS files on flya. When the static compression was turned on and set to handle the default set of files, i.e. also textcss, on cached request my custom module was served the already gzipped content. When I moved textcss to the list of dynamically compressed request, it all started working. But I would like to have a more solid proof that it is really the correct way to do it. Are there some other known consequences  problemsp  pstrongUpdatestrong I think I may have a theory as to why its happening. It may not be 100 correct, but it at least it may explain the observed behavior. I think that the static compression module registers itself to the following events among some othersp  precodeRQMAPREQUESTHANDLER RQEXECUTEREQUESTHANDLER codepre  pThen when a request for a static file is served, the static compression module in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms69305628vVS.9029.aspxOnMapRequestHandlera checks whether the file has been compressed before and whether the actual file has not been changed. If so, it will remap the request to itself returning the appropriate redirection using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms692607.aspxIMapHandlerProvidera. When it later actually serves the response in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms69110428VS.9029.aspxOnExecuteRequestHandlera, it sends the compressed file. If, on the other hand, the file has not been compressed before or if it has changed, it does not do the mapping redirect and lets the static content module serve the request and then later in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms69303328VS.9029.aspxOnPostExecuteRequestHandlera compresses the content and updates its cache. As mentioned above, Im not saying that this is exactly whats happening I dont know the source code, it may be only an approximation. Also, the dynamic compression module does not most likely do any of this. It simply compresses the outgoing responses sometimes after RQEXECUTEREQUESTHANDLER.p

Negative 106940 pI have worked with C for a while and have firm understanding of OOP. I recently began playing around with Java, and found it pretty easy to learn, but one thing came to my mind. In C, I would either use a lib such as Allegro, or OpenGL for game developing. In Java, is it a must to use an external lib just like in C The reason I ask is because I know that Java has a lot of default functions for just about anything, but are they good enough for gamesp

Negative 106940 pI have created a set of multiplatform C components to load and manage various types of digitally signed shared libraries. This handles all aspects of loading and initialziation including mapping them into the calling process, applying branch fixups, binding any imports and calling the initialization entry point. The components cannot use LoadLibrary as it is platform specific and not all of the shared libraries are in PE format. p  pOne of the few remaining issues I am faced with is providing appropriate debugger support for targeted platforms and development environments. In MS Windows environments this includes getting the debuggers to load symbol information generated by the compiler and linker or converted from other source. Because the loading and initialization of the libraries occurs outside of the kernel, the debugger never receives LOADDLLDEBUGEVENT and UNLOADDLLDEBUGEVENT events. This leads to the following questionsp  ol liIs there an API or system call that allows events such as LOADDLLDEBUGEVENT to be sent directly to the debuggerli liIs there a documented way to communicate directly with the program or session debug managers or with the machine debug manager serviceli liIs there an API or system call available to notify the kernel and subsequently the debugger that a DLL has been loaded Since PE files are one of the primary supported formats this is the most desirable option. It also has the potential benefit of allowing the library to appear in the module list of the process.li liDoes the WinDBG SDK apply to debugging on Windows as a whole and can WinDBG extensions be used to instruct the debugger to load the symbol informationli ol  pI have search extensively for information on the above mentioned topics but have come up short. I have located a bit of information about the data structures used by the Windows debugger but nothing relevant to my specific situation.p  pI am open to APIsystem calls and approaches that are documented or undocumented and those requiring elevated privileges to function.p

This link will be available on each page of the blog.p  pIf I wasnt using CodeIgniter, I would create a link with a parameter e.g. index.phpinvertedtrue and in my controller detect if GET[inverted] was set, set a SESSION variable.  The link would be changed and the additional CSS file would be added when SESSION is set.  The links new href would be something like index.phpinvertedfalse and the SESSION variable would be unset.  It would work sitewide and regardless of the rest of the URI.p  pIve tried using the urisegement functions in CodeIgniter, but because this needs to be across the whole site, my URIs change sometimes just index.phpcontrollerfunction, other times index.phpcontrollerfunctionpara1para2para3.  Therefore I cant just make my link [hrefSESSION[REQUESTURI] . inverted] and then detect if that URI segment exists because I dont know which number the segment inverted would be.  Also, if a user is on the same page and clicks the link twice, the URI keeps adding inverted again and again.p  pI made a mock form so I could use the POST array instead, but I know this isnt good practice.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 106940 pSo weve got this 32bit software package that is installed on both Win XP and Win 7 machines.p  pThe current issue that Im looking at is that when installing part of the package, registry values are written to add an executable in the package to the windows context menu. These registry values are part of a wix fragment that is generated by heat from a dll that is part of the process ie. a dll of the executable.p  pThe problem is that while it works on windows xp embedded, on windows 7, not only does the application NOT show up in the context menu, it also breaks something so that the New Folder option is removed from all context menus. Uninstalling the application doesnt work, but it can be fixed by adding the registry settings from this site a hrefhttpsocial.technet.microsoft.comForumsenIEw7itprogeneralthread97de8a2a12f24381a409a78f4ae551cf relnofollowhttpsocial.technet.microsoft.comForumsenIEw7itprogeneralthread97de8a2a12f24381a409a78f4ae551cfap  pOf course when you install a new build, then it gets wiped away again, and as developers, sometimes were installing and uninstalling 56 builds a day. Ive confirmed that it is those particular registry settings by removing them from the installer and building and installing it, and the New Folder option happily stays where it is.p  pSo my question is is there a problem with heat generating valid registry values to write for a 32bit applicationdll to be added to the context menu on windows 7 for complete disclosure, Im using win7 64bit, but weve had the same issue on win7 32bit, but we havent tried vistap

Negative 106940 pSo im trying to map color space in HTML and my knowledge is pretty much limited to CSS HTML and Javascript. I am looking for a way to construct a 2 dimensional gradient, with 2 variable along 2 vectors. My research has indicated that CSS and SVG tech only has capacity for single dimension grdaients. Or rather Linear Grads can only have a single vector. So to make up for this limitation I am using JS to iterate over the 256 changes I need so that I can get a gradient on 2 RGB color channels. So picture if you will an xaxis that is relative to for example purposes  Red and Grads from 0 to 255 and yaxis that is likewise relative  Green and Grads from 0 to 255 but with a JS iteration instead of a CSS lineargrad.p  pWhat I end up with is a beautiful representation of RGB color space BUT changes to the zaxis blue channel in this example means that I have to call on a JS function that iterates through 256 loops updating the background of 256 DOM elements with new CSS linear grads. p  pI am making this webapp because of the limitations that I see in current webbased color pickers a 256 step loop for each change of the Zaxis will place an unacceptable amount of computation overhead into the program.p  pAny Ideas for a better way to make a dual vector gradient Perhaps I could make an app specific library for the HTML 5 canvas element Where I would be operating on a bitmap instead of DOM elements maybe significantly lower the processor costpercallp

Negative 106940 pI am interested in querying data from the FQL tables which are listed under the Facebook FQL references. I understand that some piece of information is available to the public whereas some other is not. p  pI am looking to start working on a project which requires gathering data for Fan Pages. This will include number of likes, who liked the page, posts, responses, etc. Also possibly I will be looking into demographics about the users.p  pI was reading that since being a fan of a page doesnt automatically mean that you have full access into the profile of a user. Somebody said that a good idea is to create a separate FB Application which will request permission for reading data from fans. But again, I dont like this idea. Nobody would install an application without motivation like that.p  pSo, what is the best practice to do that p  pAny pointers to start looking would be appreciated.p  pThank you,p  pGeorgep

Here is my code belowp  precodevar featuredTab  this..featured,     tabContainer  e.target.parent,     menu  this.el,     index  tabContainer.index,     count  tabContainer.parent.children.length       iffeaturedTab.length gt 0          menu.offanimationend webkitAnimationEnd MSAnimationEnd oAnimationEnd, featuredTab, function              console.logoff             do stuff                    tabContainer.addClassfeatured       menu.onanimationend webkitAnimationEnd MSAnimationEnd oAnimationEnd, tabContainer, functione              console.loge.originalEvent             do stuff      codepre  pany ideas as to why the off event isnt firingp

Negative 106940 pIm trying to implement very basic deferred shading in DirectX9. I have the ability right now to only use 2 render targets The back buffer and another texture. So I can render the normals or the depth but not both. My question is can someone explain how to render to more than one texture target. I was under the impression I could just use something like the code below. It only works if the indexes are zero which probably means one of the surfaces is not being written to.p  precoded3dDevicegtSetRenderTarget0, surfaceDepth d3dDevicegtSetRenderTarget1, surfaceNormal codepre  pI get this message Direct3D9 WARN Can not render to a render target that is also used as a texture.

Negative 106940 pI upgraded from 0.5.3 to 0.9.2 of backbone.js and I noticed a significant decrease in speed on my application. The application handles many large collections and adds a large number of models at certain points. There is anywhere between 0 to 600 models added at a time. In the 0.5.3 version the sortedIndex function was the most used taking 12 of the CPU. in the 0.9.2 version the code became significantly slower and the sortBy function was taking 70 of the CPU.p  pI suspect that they are adding all the models then sorting it rather than adding each model to where it should be to keep the collection sorted. Is there a flag I can use to make it use the old method or any other way of speeding it up.

Negative 106940 pI have a service hosted in a WPF application with an async method with the Beginend methods, and when I catch an exception in the service, I want to throw a faultException to warn to the client.p  pHowever, when I try to throw the faultException, the host application crash, shutdown suddenly.p  pIn my repository, I catch the UpdateException, then, I create a custom exception, UniqueKeyException, that is throw to the caller. The caller is an auxiliar method that is called in the Begin method.p  pThis auxiliar method, catch the UniqyeKeyException and only do a throw, that is capture in the trycatch block of my end method.

The FaultException is not throw, and throw the generic exception to the client.p  pIn this case the host application does not shutdown, but close the connection with the client and I have to reconnect.p  pIt seems that the problem is the creaton of the FaultException, but I dont see the problem.p  pRoeal suggests that perhaps is only possible to use faultException with synch methods, but in this a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSasyncthreadd7f6127c0e514f2d84c9a49765fa83ac relnofollowlinka I can see an example in which is used with async methods.

My problem is that in the FaultException, T is an object that have a property that was a self tracking entity, and this is a problem, if I am not wrong, I only can use basic types as properties of the exception.p  pThen, in the exception, I have implmemented ISerialize. Its needed to be able to send the information to the client, without this, the client receives an exception.Detail with null properties.p

Negative 106940 pI have an embedded application, running on a linux based modem, that sends data via SSL socket to a specific url. The modem is set up to send data via ethernet eth0. However, if the ethernet connection is unavailable, it needs to switch to wireless ppp0 as a backup. I tried SOBINDTODEVICE but it did not work, I believe because of permission issues. What works, but is complicated and prone to errors, is to reconfigure the modem on the fly by disabling the eth0 port with an AT command which forces the socket connections to be made through the wireless port. Then, I periodically check if eth0 is back up by reconfiguring the modem, checking the connection and then reconfigure back to ppp0 if it is not. Its clumsy and the devices AT server is unreliable.p  pIs there a better way p  pOne idea would be to have two urls on our remote server. One for ethernet socket and one for wireless. Thus, you could set up the routing tables accordingly. if the connection to the ethernet url is not successful, try the other url which will be routed to the ppp0 interface. p  pGood idea or not Any other ideasp
Negative 106940 pI have a form built with Form Builder, containing an XBL component that is a little form with just xforms labels and inputs. I want to display the form and by the way the component in two languages FR French, and NL Dutch, so in the XBL, I duplicated each label, with attributes langfr and langnl. But, when i run my form in Form Runner with the parameter frlanguagenl, i get all my form translated in Dutch, except the XBL component that is still in French by default. Can you help me please if i did something wrong. Thank you.p
Negative 106940 pIve just come across a situation in the app Im working in, in which I wrote an action specifically for setting the language cookie and redirect to the last url. Something like thisp  precodedef language   cookies[locale]  value gt params[locale], domain gt APPDOMAIN   redirecttoback end codepre  pThing is, Im not very pleased with this. Since the whole purpose of the endpoint is to set a new language for the app on the server side, this superlight logic kind of gets jammed in the whole middleware stack before it actually reaches the controller, which hurts the performance of the workflow. But later, I found out I could redirect straight from the route mapper httpguides.rubyonrails.orgrouting.htmlredirection, and thought I had found the solution to all my problems. p  precodematch languagelocale gt redirect p, req req.cookies[locale]  value gt p[locale], domain gt APPDOMAIN  req.referrer    codepre  pProblem is, Even though I have access to the request, and can therefore insert cookies in it, only the last value of the redirect block will be taken to form the redirection response. Which will not check the request and set its cookies or whatever more there may be accordingly. So yeah, the question is, does anybody know a way of influencing the route.rb redirections a bit more than by passing the destination route p  pAnd no, I dont want a clientside solution. Im fully aware I can also do this with JS, I just wanted a noJS solution. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 106940 pMy basic situation I have an include file that has something like codedefine foo Flag1  Flags2  Flag3code, so its a predefined combination of bit flags. For the sake of typesafety, I wanted to replace these defines by static consts, i.e. codestatic const int foo  Flag1  Flag2  Flag3code or similar. This include file is included in dozens of places in the program.p  pNow when Im doing a release build with all relevant optimisation options enabled using the C compiler of VS2010, replacing the defines seems to increase the executable by a few KiB, depending on how many constants I replaced.p  pWhy does this happen To my knowledge, integer constants are supposed to be inlined into the ASM code that is produced if possible, and I dont see how using a codestatic constcode vs codedefinecode would make a difference here. Clearly, the variable isnt inlined as the disassembly showsp  precodedefine 01325041  or          eax,0FFD87FE0h static int 011E5451  or          eax,dword ptr [CMainFramesTemplateModulePaths38h 151F008h] codepre  pSo the final question is How can I avoid codedefinecode but still rely on the variable being inserted directly into the generated assemblyp

Returning 0 at the end of main has never hurt me before, and the memory address doesnt match up with either of the ones Im using.  When I run my program in Terminal, I get codeSegmentation fault 11code.  The only thing I can think of is that its something to do with the operating system, which makes sense for several reasons  the relatively low memory address, and the error being thrown by the O.S. trying to access the memory address on the stack to return to.  Why could this be happening, though  I dont know much about Operating Systems Im learning about C so I can skip a course requirement and take the Operating Systems course offered by my university so maybe this is a really easy question.  I tried running another C program in the same directory, and it went just fine.p

Negative 106940 pI am using Eclicpse to develop a static library made of functions that I use often. I have done so creating a C  Static Library project in my workspace.p  pIn the same workspace I have created an other project Test that I use to test that my functions work as expected. I have linked the libraries to this project and I am able to use the library in my code.p  pOne of my functions has some problems and I would like to debug it. If I run Debug in Eclipse on my test project I cant however step in the function that is causing problems.p  pHow can I achieve this Alternatively which is a good way by which I can test and debug my static libraries in Eclipsep

Negative 106940 pThe Dynamic Shared Object library on Linux is approximately equal the dll in Windows. Thats what I found online. But there are some differences and they are explained here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6251171architecturallywhatisthedifferencebetweenasharedobjectsoandadynamiArchitecturally what is the difference between a shared object SO and a dynamic link library DLLap  pThen I am confusedp  ol lipIn linux one can use shared to create a DSO library, then link with lmylib. But in windows, things are different. One have to add dllexport into the code. Only the exported part can be linked If I am correct. Is there a option to make windows dll linkable without adding dllexport I tried to make a dll with just functions and no dllexport, but what I can tell so far is that the dll without dllexport is something useless, rightpli lipWhat does MinGW do I thought it create dlls in the days when I used it. But now I think the library that created by MinGWgcc shared is something else. Is it windows version lib.so Can MSVSintel compiler do the similar thingpli ol  pI am asking these because of cross platform issues. For example, a linux code can be compiled without any changes on windows machine. But if one want to create a dll by using the code compiled with MSVS which is equivalent to the .so without modifying code adding dllexport, it is impossible. Am I rightp
Negative 106940 pHaving followed several examples with no success, I find myself at a dead end on this issue. The issue I am encountering is how to fill a codeListViewcode with data from a database.p  pThe purpose is to create a screen with the listView which displays only the name column from the database, then when the item is selected the application goes to a new screen where it displays the other data related to the item.p  pThe things Id like help with understanding are filling the codeListViewcode

I need to programmatically draw objects so I am overriding the ondraw method.p  pThe problem is that when I have a zoom scale of anything other than 1, if I pinch on one side of the drawn object, the drawn object jumps away from pinch focus point and you end up with a focus point other than what you started with if the zoom scale is greater than 1. If the zoom scale is less than 1, the drawn object jumps towards the pinch focus.p  pIve tried just about everything, but I must be getting too old and tired, because I just cant figure it out.p  pIn the ondraw, I am scaling then translating, then drawing the object at a fixed point.p  pAm I going about this in the right manner I cannot find anything on searches that involve drawing an object at a point on a canvas whilst implementing pinch zooming.p  pIf anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated.p  pCode is as follows...p  precodeclass clsTarget  ImageView, ImageView.IOnTouchListener      private ScaleGestureDetector mScaleDetector     private ScaleListener sListener     private static float mScaleFactor  0.6F     private static float scalePointX     private static float scalePointY      private static int INVALIDPOINTERID  1     private int mActivePointerId  INVALIDPOINTERID     private static float mPosX, mPosY, mLastTouchX, mLastTouchY      public clsTargetContext context          basecontext              this.SetOnTouchListenerthis          sListener  new ScaleListener         mScaleDetector  new ScaleGestureDetectorcontext, sListener         mScaleFactor  800F  floatMath.MinResources.DisplayMetrics.WidthPixels, Resources.DisplayMetrics.HeightPixels           protected override void OnDrawAndroid.Graphics.Canvas canvas              canvas.Save          canvas.ScalemScaleFactor, mScaleFactor, scalePointX, scalePointY         canvas.TranslatemPosX, mPosY          Paint p  new PaintPaintFlags.AntiAlias         p.Color  Color.Orange         p.SetStylePaint.Style.Fill         p.StrokeWidth  1F         canvas.DrawCircle400, 400, 200, p          canvas.Restore           public bool OnTouchView v, MotionEvent e              mScaleDetector.OnTouchEvente          switch e.Action amp MotionEventActions.Mask                      case MotionEventActions.Down                 float x  e.GetX  scalePointX  mScaleFactor                 float y  e.GetY  scalePointY  mScaleFactor                  mLastTouchX  x                 mLastTouchY  y                  mActivePointerId  e.GetPointerId0                 break              case MotionEventActions.Move                 int pointerIndex  e.FindPointerIndexmActivePointerId                  float x2  e.GetXpointerIndex  scalePointX  mScaleFactor                 float y2  e.GetYpointerIndex  scalePointY  mScaleFactor                  float dx  x2  mLastTouchX                 float dy  y2  mLastTouchY                  if mScaleDetector.IsInProgress                                      mPosX  dx                     mPosY  dy                      mLastTouchX  x2                     mLastTouchY  y2                                   this.Invalidate                  break              case MotionEventActions.Up                 mActivePointerId  INVALIDPOINTERID                 break              case MotionEventActions.Cancel                 mActivePointerId  INVALIDPOINTERID                 break              case MotionEventActions.PointerUp                 int pointerIndex2  inte.Action amp MotionEventActions.PointerIndexMask gtgt intMotionEventActions.PointerIndexShift                 int pointerID  e.GetPointerIdpointerIndex2                  if pointerID  mActivePointerId                                      int newPointerIndex  pointerIndex2  0  1  0                      mLastTouchX  e.GetXnewPointerIndex  scalePointX  mScaleFactor                     mLastTouchY  e.GetYnewPointerIndex  scalePointY  mScaleFactor                      mActivePointerId  e.GetPointerIdnewPointerIndex                                   break                   return true           private class ScaleListener  ScaleGestureDetector.SimpleOnScaleGestureListener              public override bool OnScaleScaleGestureDetector detector                      scalePointX  detector.FocusX             scalePointY  detector.FocusY              mScaleFactor  detector.ScaleFactor             mScaleFactor  Math.Max0.5f, Math.MinmScaleFactor, 7.0f              return true                codepre

Negative 106940 pI am working on some legacy code which uses MFCs UI Threads to implement a manager threadworker thread mechanism. The code used to run under an MFC GUI application but now its in a separate dll and is run both from the GUI application and from a console application.p  pThe manager thread, worker threads and main application communicate via Thread messages the worker thread doesnt really need to send messages to the manager thread but this is the way it was implemented originally and worked, so there you go.p  pNow, when I run my code from  the console app, messages sent from the main thread to the manager thread are handled and my handler is called. It is only when I try to send a message from the manager thread to the worker threads that I have problems. The call to codePostThreadMessagecode succeeds but the handler is never invoked. This behavior was reproduced in both a plainold console application as well as in a Win32 console application that includes a precompiled header with all the MFC goodies.p  pI found this old Microsoft article a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb142415 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb142415a but I have to admit I didnt really understand it. I tried as it suggests to override the codePreTranslateMessagecode function and to explicitly handle my custom messages there but the function was never invoked after calling codePostThreadMessagecodep  pI tried to reproduce the problem in the sample below and in my sample even the message to the manager thread is never handled, which confirms my suspicion that Im doing something wrong.p  pEDIT I added the missing codeInitInstancecode and codeExitInstancecode to overload codeManagerThreadcode that was missing from my sample code, as MarsRover suggested and indeed codeManagerThreadcode messages are now pumped, but codeWorkerThreadcode messages are not, which acurately reproduces the problem Im having in my original code.

Negative 106940 pWe have a quatz job that does a lot of calculations and is taking a while to complete.  In order to speed it up we want to split the primary job to start multiple smaller jobs that do the calculations and return the result.

But, alongside I am placing an image which is actually getting created based on the two values. Now on selecting the next dropdownlist item there is a page refresh and the placed image dissapears.

In my case, there exists a table in which there are two halfs, the left has text boxes n a button n to the right side of the table the image appears.p

Negative 106940 pI was reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8690567settinganinttoinfinityincSetting an int to Infinity in Ca. I understand that when one needs true infinity, one is supposed to use codenumericlimitsltfloatgtinfinitycode I guess the rationale behind it is that usually integral types have no values designated for representing special states like emNaNem, emInfem, etc. like IEEE 754 floats do again C doesnt mandate neither  codeintcode amp codefloatcode used are left to the implementation but still its misleading that codemax gt infinitycode for a given type. Im trying to understand the rationale behind this call in the standard. If having codeinfinitycode doesnt make sense for a type, then shouldnt it be disallowed instead of having a flag to be checked for its validityp

Negative 106940 pSuppose I want to define a set of functions, each having 4 overloads, the first overload taking a single parameter of type codeint32tcode and the second taking codeint64tcode, the third  codeuint32tcode and the fourth  codeuint64tcode. For each function, all overloads have the same implementation so I could define a function template insteadp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt void fT t     ...  codepre  pHowever this is different from having four overloads because now I have a separate function for each integer type that can be used to instantiate codefcode. The implementation details of codefcode are such that it might not work for other integral types however. To address this I can wrap the function template in four overloaded functions p  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt void fimplT t     ...   void fint32t value  fimplvalue  void fint64t value  fimplvalue  void fuint32t value  fimplvalue  void fuint64t value  fimplvalue  codepre  pIt works but requires substantial amount of code for each function 4 function overloads  1 function template. Is there a way to simplify thisp  pTo clarify, it is not desirable to use template directly because it doesnt make sense for implementation reasons or otherwise to have its specializations for types other than codeint32tcode, codeint64tcode, codeuint32tcode and codeuint64tcode.p  hr  pIve tried using codestdenableifcode already and the problem with it is best illustrated by this examplep  precodeinclude lttypetraitsgt include ltiostreamgt  template lttypename Tgt struct issupportedint    static const bool value  false   template ltgt struct issupportedintltint32tgt    static const bool value  true   template ltgt struct issupportedintltint64tgt    static const bool value  true    ...  template lttypename T, typename  typename stdenableifltissupportedintltTgtvalue, Tgttypegt void fT t   ...   int main    short s  42   fs  codepre  pUnlike in the original version with overloads which Im trying to emulate, this example will not compile since codefcode will be excluded from the set of matching functions for codeshortcode.p  pUnfortunately codestdisintegralltTgtcode as suggested by Rapptz doesnt help either because due to implementation details of codefcode this function can only be defined for specific types, not for all integral types.p

Negative 106940 pI was given this question to test my programming ability. Though I feel it is as much math as it is programming. I have failed honestly, but I would like to know how it is done for future reference.p  pThe ideal answer will use recursion and threads.p  pYour niece was given a set of blocks for her birthday, and she has decided to build a panel using 31 and 4.51 blocks. For structural integrity, the spaces between the blocks must not line up in adjacent rows. For example, the 13.53 panel below is unacceptable, because some of the spaces between the blocks in the first two rows line up as indicated by the dotted line.p  pThere are 2 ways in which to build a 7.51 panel, 2 ways to build a 7.52 panel, 4 ways to build a 123 panel, and 7958 ways to build a 275 panel. How many different ways are there for your niece to build a 4810 panel The answer will fit in a 64bit integer. Write a program to calculate the answer.p  pThat is the issue, I am not sure where to begin in terms of math. I understand I need to compute all possible combinations for the first row. But I am not really sure how. Then you could at this point on a particular thread calculate all possible combos for the next row and so on. And then each first row combination could get its own thread and pass its setup into a recursive algorithm that compares the current row to the last one, and finds a possible answer. But I cant really program it because I dont know how to calculate the possible combinations for any row. If I did, then maybe I could check to see if its a legal row no two blocks exactly on top of each other staggered and move on to the next one. Possibly each row would be a for loop for nested around the next one in terms of Code. But again I dont know what to do for the mathematical aspect of it. p

Negative 106940 pIve observed the following behavior with CompositionTarget.Rendering if I dont do anything in the event handler, it is raised 30 times per second. If I invalidate something in the event handler, it is raised 60 times per second discarding times when it is raised several times per frame.p  pMy monitors refresh rate is 60hz, so it looks like the event will skip a refresh if nothing was done last time it was raised.p  pWhat is the reason for this behavior and is there any way to get called consistently at the monitors refresh rate without invalidating something every timep  pThis is on .NET 3.5 by the way.p

Negative 106940 pI use a generic base class and derived classes that implement specific instances with their own specialist individual dependencies.  I dont want developers to have to install all the dependencies, only the ones they need, so I put the derived classes in their own assemblies  dlls.  I then use a factory that creates the correct instance depending on parameters passed in.  All calls against that returned instance need to get routed to the correct derived method.  Only that isnt working.  They get routed to the base class methods instead.  Is there a way to configure this  It worked fine when they were in the same assembly.p

Negative 106940 pI am really trying to optimize my code for moving codeUIImageViewscode.p  pI have a primary method for enumerating through all of my codeUIImageViewscode.p  pWhich enumeration would perform faster, or would they both perform exactly the samep  pExample 1 In this example I enumerate through all codeUIImageViewscode in my codeUIViewControllercodes view p  precode for UIImageView imageView in self.view.subviews      ...  codepre  pExample 2 In this example I enumerate through all codeUIImageViewscode in my codeNSMutableArraycode. The array always contains all of the codeUIImageViewscode found in codeself.view.subviewscode Its just a copy of all the UIImageViews normally found in self.view.subviews that I only need to create oncep  precode for UIImageView imageView in self.imageViews      ...  codepre  pSo which example should provide me with a faster and more optimized enumeration Note that these are constantly enumerated by a CADisplayLink that I have setup. Also note that codeself.view.subviewscode returns an codeNSArraycode so perhaps this codeNSArraycode is constantly being created when I use the first enumeration, making me think that the codeNSMutableArraycode approach would perform better and have less overhead but im not sure.p  pEdit All of the subviews are codeUIImageViewscode. I am also not sure if there is any significant overhead when using the subviews property because it looks like it may do some behindthescenes work to get me that NSArray.p

Also if you could give me any suggestion on how to accurately store these created words into the 2d array arrWords it would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 106940 pOur security department wants us to use 256bit encryption to encrypt SSN, Names of Users etc, so we decided to go with JASYPT with the sample code belowp  precodeencryptor  new StandardPBEStringEncryptor encryptor.setProvidernew BouncyCastleProvider encryptor.setAlgorithmPBEWITHSHA256AND256BITAESCBCBC encryptor.setPasswordOURKEY encryptor.encryptTEXT TO ECNCRYPT codepre  pThe problem we noticed is when our application creates an encrypted record from our local machine, the application on the appdev server cannot decrypt it and vice versa even though the key is same.

This creates a problem for us because if we ever migrated our production server to another machine, or refreshed preprod data with the prod data, we may need a couple of million years to recover the information.p  pThe security department wants us to use a well know library and not brew an inhouse solution. Can someone please throw some light on this issue on how we can generate encrypted string that can be decrypted across different machines using jasypt 256 bit encryption, or when we refresh preprod database with prod data, how we would be able to recover names etc that were encrypted through a different serverp  pAny useful insights will be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 106940 pIm using codeTObjectBindSourceAdaptercode to use livebindings with an object.  One of the properties of the object im using with codeTObjectBindSourceAdaptercode has an enumerated type, but the field in the adapter is never generated when i use an enumerated type in my objectp  pThe Only solution i have found for now is to define the enumerated type as an integer in my object and typecast it.

Negative 106940 pstrongIssue summary AFUNIX stable sending, bursty receiving.strongp  pI have an application B that receives data over unix domain datagram socket. There is peer application A that sends data to it. Both A and B are running continuously and are SCHEDFIFO. My application A also prints the time of reception. p  pThe peer application B can send data at varying timings varying in terms of milliseconds only. Ideally what I expect the packet send delay should exactly match with reception delay. For example p  precodeA sends in time              5ms     10ms      15ms     21ms   30ms   36ms B should receive in time     5x ms  10x ms   15x ms  21x ms ...  codepre  pWhere x is a constant delay.p  pBut when I experimented what I observe in B is  p  precodeA sends in time              5ms     10ms      15ms     21ms   30ms   36ms B received in time           5w ms  10x ms   15y ms  21z ms ...  codepre  pw,x,y,z are different constant delays. So I cannot predict reception time when sending time is given.p  pIs it because some buffering is involved in unix domain socket  Please suggest some  workaround for the issue so that the reception time is predicable from send time.

The last function generates row and column sums of what I am calling a heavy matrix, and based on these values, I calculate row and column sums for a light matrix rp,cp, and then test dominance to see if a light matrix is feasible, where a light matrix is just 0s, and 1s, of half the weight of the heavy matrix. The problem is that I generate a lot of data and through out around half of it when I get down to the dominating and conjugating functions. Is there a way to somehow get this done faster, or cut out unnecessary data sooner  Also is there a way to parallelize another function that will run more processes on the output from partitionlistsp

Negative 106940 pI have created a pivot table in excel with vba. Now I have to group some different rows. For Example A1, A6, A19 ...p  pThe information which rows should be grouped are on an own Worksheet where I read from. When I create an new string which contains for example groupString  A1, A5, A90, A103 and then I use codeWorksheetsTableTest.RangegroupString.Groupcode I always get an Runtime Error that I cannot group multiple selections.p  pWhen I use codeWorksheetsTableTest.RangeA1, A23.Groupcode it works, but I need the groups which I read from the other Worksheet. Thanks for helping.p  pKind regards  p

Negative 106940 pSay, you begin a SqlTransaction from C inside which you are inserting data from a DataTable into a SQL table, but this data is A LOT of data, so you do it in chunks with a SqlBulkCopy inside the SQL transaction and only commit the transaction if ALL the chunks copied succesfully. p  pNow, lets say you know that at times the length of the values being inserted will surpass the max column size in the target table, so the SqlBulkCopy will fail at that point for that particular chunk. Is it possible or even advisable to catch this exception and alter the tablecolumn to increase the max length of the target column, then continue SqlBulkCopying data picking up the next chunk to be copied even though you havent committed your insert transaction you began withp  pSo, trying to paraphrase this, is it possible to start a DML transaction, stop in the middle of this uncommitted transaction, perform a DDL to alter the target table, then complete the original DML and commit itp

After 10 minutes of waiting nothing shows up. The application is not terminated since my last notification comes from codeapplicationDidEnterBackgroundcode and codeapplicationWillTerminatecode was never called while I was working on the task.p  pIn a quite accidental way I discovered that if my app is running and is still scanning in the background and another BLE scanning application Im using the excelent a hrefhttpsitunes.apple.comusappblexplrid524018027mt8 relnofollowBLExplra is in the foreground and starts scanning, my application is finaly receiving results in the same time as the foreground appliaction.

Negative 106940 pI understand that ISession is not thread safe and SessionFactory is thread safe.  As such, Ive wrapped and confirmed that I have one session per thread.p  pIm receiving an error under the following situation and was wondering if this is something not supported, or Im still missing something with my ISession thread isolation.p  pI am running NUnit tests.  I have a scenario where my Entity is stubbed out as a field variable.  I have a test that runs 2 parallel tasks. p  p Each parallel task creates its own session from the same SessionFactory and begins an NHibernate Transaction.br  They each update the entity and perform a SaveOrUpdate on it.br  Then Commit and close the transaction.br Each task does this about 10k times.p  pDuring this test I get a message  p  precodeSystem.AggregateException  One or more errors occurred.   gt NHibernate.HibernateException  identifier of an instance of Domain.Entity.MyEntity was altered from 2 to 1 codepre  pThis makes sense because the MyEntity is a field object and consumed by both threads.  So a single object created in the NUnit class is reference and updated by both threads.  p  pMy question is whether a scenario like this can be avoided by pessimistic locking or other NHibernate features  Or is this just not doable and I have to make sure this situation i.e my Entity object is not referenced and updated by more than one thread at a time never occurs in my code  p  pIve tired some options in NHibernate, like ensuring versioning of the entity and tried some locking calls, but Im guessing in the dark through the documentation which is the right way, if any to handle this scenario.p  pEdit  Thanks for the comments  Here is the code in the unit testp  precodeprivate PluginConfiguration configStub1      [SetUp]     public void Setup              new FluentMapper.Configuration.ExposeConfiguration             e gt new SchemaExporte.Dropfalse, true                       configStub1  new PluginConfiguration                              Enabled  true,                 Keys  Name,                 Value  Fred,                 PluginName  red,                 RuntimeId  1                         [Test]     [Explicit]     public void HighVolumeSavesMultiManagerSameDataRecordSameInstanceMultiThread              Action action1   gt                      var dal  new DataAccessManager             for int i  0 i lt 10000 i                              dal.Begin                 dal.Current.Session.SaveOrUpdateconfigStub1                 dal.Current.Commit                 dal.End                                Action action2   gt                      var dal  new DataAccessManager             for int i  0 i lt 10000 i                              dal.Begin                 dal.Current.Session.SaveOrUpdateconfigStub1                 dal.Current.Commit                 dal.End                                var task1  Task.Factory.StartNewaction1         var task2  Task.Factory.StartNewaction2          task1.Wait         task2.Wait      codepre  pThe DataAccess Manager referenced in the test is as followsp  precodepublic class DataAccessManager  IDataAccessManager      private readonly ThreadLocalltISessionManagergt current  new ThreadLocalltISessionManagergt      public void Begin              Current  new SessionManager          public ISessionManager Current              get  return current.Value          set  current.Value  value           public void Endbool doComplete  true              bool isActive  Current.Transaction  null ampamp Current.Transaction.IsActive          if doComplete ampamp isActive Current.Commit         else if doComplete ampamp isActive Current.Transaction.Rollback          Current.Dispose       codepre  pThe SessionManager is as suchp  precodepublic class SessionManager  ISessionManager       ltsummarygt      Initializes a new instance of the ltsee crefSessionManagergt class.      ltsummarygt     public SessionManager              Session  ContextFactory.OpenSession         Transaction  Session.BeginTransaction           public ITransaction Transaction  get private set      public ISession Session  get private set       public void Commit              try                      Transaction.Commit                  catch Exception ex                      Transaction.Rollback             throw                codepre

Negative 106940 pIm trying to mock an object that is passed to my SUT. When passed, the SUT registers the mock as observer for some properties. In SUT dealloc, it calls coderemoveObservercode on the mock. This was working just fine with OCMockito 0.23, but when updating to 1.0.0, this test makes OCMockito to get trapped in code[HCIsEqual .cxxdestruct]code. Debugging a little bit, lead me to codeMKTInvocationContainercode methodp  precode voidsetInvocationForPotentialStubbingNSInvocation invocation codepre  pin which the invocation is told to retain its arguments. Could be a retain cyclep  pFurthermore, Ive been doing some research and I found several SO answers stating the incompatibility between codeNSProxycode and KVOp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9054970nsproxyandkeyvalueobservingNSProxy and Key Value Observingap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma174571552824409httpstackoverflow.coma174571552824409ap  pHowever, I wonder why this was working with OCMockito 0.23 and not now. Any ideap  pThe solution in my case is to replace the mock with a real object. This works fine, but it is painful to build a whole object for a test suite that barely uses it.p  pAt any case, if KVO is not supported with mocks, I believe this should be documented, and properly handled.p  p[EDIT]p  pI found a workaround for this problem.p  pWe are using a custom block based KVO infrastructure, similar to the described here a hrefhttpwww.mikeash.compyblogkeyvalueobservingdoneright.html relnofollowhttpwww.mikeash.compyblogkeyvalueobservingdoneright.htmla. Now, SUT is registering the mock for KVO, passing codeselfcode inside a block. I believe codeselfcode is being retained somewhere, but it shouldnt be, since it is weakified before the block...p  pUsing the default kvo framework provided by Apple seems to fix this problem. However, Im still worried about the underlying problem. What changed in OCMockito that makes this fail nowp  pAnyway, sorry for the trouble and thank you very much.p

I could call appContext.getBeandataSource1 but Ive read thats bad practice since it creates an explicit dependency on the spring framework in your code.  Is there are better way to accomplish this in a way that is not implementation specific  Perhaps something like DatasourceFactory.getInstancedatasource1p  pIs this a weird request  I realize this would be very easy if the container class was a Spring bean since I could just use standard dependency injection in that case.  But this is something Ive been curious about.  It seems that using dependency injection creates an endless loop, where if you want to use a spring bean in a class then that class must also be a bean, and then if another class wants to use that bean then it must also be a bean, and so on, and so on.  I dont see an elegant way to break the dependency injection chain.p  pAgain, maybe its not necessary to break the chain, maybe the answer is that you do make all your classes spring beans, but I was just curious.p  pCan service locator pattern be applied here  If so can someone provide an example  Thanks.p

Negative 106940 pI have a text document with several sections and each section has title and body. This needs to be filtered by certain criteria and removed all junk characters in it.  There is a problem with processing this document in map reduce as the order of lines gets jumbled in mapper output.  So I have introduced a custom datatype linenumValuetuple and assigned a line number to each line as it is read with the text in the value so that it gets sorted by line number in reducer and key as the title id.  But the problem is each section gets split across different mappers and single section gets different title ids. How do I make a single section as one split so that I can get the same title id for all lines and sort it in output in same order as the input p

Negative 106940 pI created a recursive DFS algorithm to generatesolve sudoku boards in Java, but its taking forever to terminate, and an explanationoptimization would be welcome. I cant imagine that generating a sudoku board would be so timeconsuming, especially with all the apps around although they might have a database.p  pBasically, I traverse all cells, seeing whether any of [19] would satisfy the sudoku constraints, and backtrack on deadend branches. To conserve memory and avoid copying the 2D array that serves as the board with each invocation of the recursive method and there are potentially 819 leaves in that tree, if Im not mistaken..., I created a 2D matrix of integer stacks, in which an element is pushed every time a branch is explored, and popped if its a deadend.p  pBelow is the implementation. Any advice on speedup would be welcome. Im doing this as a personal excercise, and Im wondering if something asymptotically better exists.p  pHope its not a terrible read below..

Negative 106940 pIn my WPF application Im using the MVVM pattern and the repository pattern. I have a repository that provides a list of aircraft objects. From a user perspective, I want to display these aircrafts in several different ways e.g. on a map, in lists, in textual form, etc.., and also allow the user to filter the objects. To achieve this I have built views and viewmodels for each of the different ways of representing the data. p  pMy problem now is that Im not sure what the best practice is for making the list of aircraft objects available for all the different viewmodels. Heres some of the alternatives Ive considered p  p1.Inject the repository into each viewmodel, and then get all the objects from the repo.p  p2.Inject the repository into a MainViewModel that retrieves all the objects from the repo, and then inject the object collection into all other viewmodels that needs it.p  pSo in sum I have a set of viewmodels that all make use of the same collection of model objects. What is the best practice for sharing this collection between the viewmodels when using the repository patternp

Promise, array and infinite parametersp  pAnd I dont know why I dont have any logs.p  pI just tried again but from my program this time and I get correctly the callbacks. Should I assume that there is a problem with the mongomigrate module that dont trigger callbacks I tried to run the script in debug mode IDE and I couldnt reach the callback when I could reach the call to the functions.p  pWhat do you thinkp

Negative 106940 pIm trying to improve the performance of my code. The code basicly calculates the value of codeLtotalcode 1x2640 and it does it by fetching the data from another variable called codeLCNcode 1320x6. I also have codecolindexescode matrix 2640x3 which stores the values of rows to look at in codeLCNcode.p  pSo, how this goes is, the code looks at codecolindexescode to get the row data. Say codecolindexescode is of the following formp  precode55    65    75 68    75    85 ... codepre  pThe program will calculate codeLtotal1code using codeLCN55,1  LCN65,1  LCN75,1code. Here the first indices refer to the row numbers obtained from the codecolindexescode matrix. The second indices represent the number of occurrences of these row numbers so far. Therefore, when we calculate codeLtotal2code, it will be codeLCN68,1  LCN75,2  LCN85,1code. Here codeLCN75,2code happened because codeLCN75,1code was used before.p  pTo calculate the entire codeLtotalcode matrix, the following code works well. It stores the number of occurrences for each index by incrementing the corresponding index in a variable called codelistcode2640x1 and thus calculates codeLtotalcode. It does so in 0.023715 seconds. Note that codencode is 2640 belowp  precodefor i1n      listcolindexesi,  listcolindexesi,  1      Ltotali  sumdiagLCNcolindexesi,,listcolindexesi, end codepre  pThe problem is, I will be running this portion of the code over and over, maybe like a million times. Its a part of a big simulation. Hence, even a smallest portion of increase in the performance is what I am after for. First, I thought getting rid of the for loop would serve for this purpose and switched the code into the following  getting a little help from this topic a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19695619vectoroftheoccurencenumberVector of the occurence numberap  precodelistcol  reshapecolindexes,1,[] occurrence  sumtriubsxfuneq,listcol,listcol. list  reshapeoccurrence,3,[] straightindex  colindexes  list  1k Ltotal  sumLCNstraightindex,2 codepre  pThis code also does the job for codelistcolcode 1x7920, codeoccurrencecode 1x7920, codelistcode 2640x3 and codestraightindexcode 2640x3. However, contrary to my expectations, it takes 0.062168 seconds, about three times worse than the for loop implementation. 0.05217 seconds of this operation is due the second line, where the occurrence matrix is formed. With array sizes like mine, it is truly inefficient to find the occurrences like this way.p  pThe question is, with or without the for loop, how can I increase the performance of this code The vectorization method seems nice, if only I can figure out a way to calculate the occurrence matrix faster. As I said, this portion of code will be run a lot of times, and thus any percent of increase in performance is welcomed.p  pThank youp  pFurther info codecolindexescode represent a big matrix of size 1320x2640. Instead of storing this entire matrix, I only store the row locations of 1s in this matrix in codecolindexescode. The rest is zero. So the codecolindexescode I specified in the question means, there is a 1 in 1st col 55th row and 2nd col 85th row... So the min,max range is 1,1320. There are only 3 1s in each column, so thats why its size is 2640x3. This is, of course, background information, for how it is formed. If that helps, the number of occurences for each value in codecolindexescode is also the same, which is 6.p  pSo, for a matrix codeA  [1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0]code, the codecolindexescode is code[1 2 2 1]code.p

For example if I add 5 products it will only show one, but if I put a break point and I run the code in debug mode I see that the value inserted in the Quantity table is 5 not 1, so the Quantity value on the table is inserted correctly, but the repeater reports 1. p  pHere is the codep  precode    ltaspRepeater IDrptConfirmOrder runatservergt          ltItemTemplategt                      ltfieldset class  OrderConfirmationFieldsetgtltlegend class OrderDataLegendgtOrder Summaryltlegendgt                      lttd alignleft width60 runatserver idTd25gt                         ltaspLabel IDlblQuantity runatserver TextQuantity  CssClass  lblOrderConfirmationgt                         ltaspLabelgt lt EvalQuantity  gt                         ltbr gt                      lttdgt                          lttd alignleft width60 runatserver idTd26gt                             ltaspLabel IDlblProductName runatserver TextProduct Name  CssClass  lblOrderConfirmationgt                             ltaspLabelgtlt EvalProductName ,0c   gt                             ltbr gt                         lttdgt                         lttd alignleft width60 runatserver idTd27gt                             ltaspLabel IDlblProductPrice runatserver TextProduct price  CssClass  lblOrderConfirmationgt                             ltaspLabelgt  lt EvalProductPrice ,0c   gt                             ltbr gt                         lttdgt                         lttd alignleft width60 runatserver idTd28gt                             ltaspLabel IDlblSubtotal runatserver TextSubtotal  CssClass  lblOrderConfirmationgt                             ltaspLabelgt  lt EvalSubtotal ,0c   gt                             ltbr gt                         lttdgt                          lttd alignleft width60 runatserver idTd29gt                             ltaspLabel IDlblTotal runatserver TextTotal  CssClass  lblOrderConfirmationgt                             ltaspLabelgt  lt EvalTotal ,0c   gt                             ltbr gt                         lttdgt ltItemTemplategt      ltaspRepeatergt codepre  pCan Anyone helpp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 106940 pi have a problem with my program. Im using Aforge for the video stream, ZXing for the qr code decoding part, c and windows forms.p  pI have set up, in the initialize function, the event handler for each framep  precodevideoSource.NewFrame  new NewFrameEventHandlervideoNewFrame codepre  pIn the videonewFrame i have all the code i need in my application it takes the frame, compute it, find the QR code, decode it, check something and then show a messageBox and so on for every frame. My problem is when i show the qr code, program computes it and the messagebox appears with the ok button, so app should be stopped if i get out of the camera field of view the paper with the qr code, im expecting that, when i will click on the ok button, it will go on in the code and the next frame will be empty meaning without the paper with the qr code  so NO messagebox in the next frame. But it isnt like that The most of the times, the event handler has already fired up 123 call to the videonewframe, and that means that i will have another 123 messagebox. The code is thisp  precodeprivate void videoNewFrame2object sender, NewFrameEventArgs eventArgs   Bitmap img  BitmapeventArgs.Frame.Clone var result  reader.Decodeimg if result  null      if DialogResult.OK  MessageBox.Showhello          do something     img.Dispose   codepre  pI have tried different things ive tried to unsubscribe from the event handler at the beginning and subscribe again at the end of videonewframe functionp  precodevideoSource.NewFrame  videoNewFrame  at the beginning, at first line ... videoSource.NewFrame  videoNewFrame  in the if of the DialogResult, in the  do something codepre  pbut no results. p  pSo i tried with a bool value i added an if statement that check if the bool value is true and if it is, it puts bool value  false to avoid the next event handling, it does the stuff and if value is false it returns then, when it is doing the stuff, in the if of the DialogResult, in the  do something, ive put bool  true again. No success for me.p  pSo my problem still remains there i just want the function to work always but i want, somehow, that when it finds a result a qr code it stops firing events for just the time needed to show only one messagebox so, for example, stop the event handling or something like that...p  pHope you can help me Thanks in advance p  pstrongEDITstrong after Bartosz answerp  pfirst of all thank you Now i didnt know about singleton or what they are, so thank you also for the knowledge Unfortunately, problem still remains probably it is my fault in developing well the class i have tried this p  precodepublic sealed class Singleton      static readonly Singleton instance  new Singleton     static Singleton       Singleton       public static Singleton Instance              get                      return instance                   public bool alreadyWorking  codepre  pthen, i made two test make a global variable and use the Instancep  precodeSingleton test  Singleton.Istance dont know if this is good codepre  pand in the intialize method i havep  precodetest.alreadyWorking  false  global variable Singleton.Istance.alreadyWorking  false  istance codepre  pthen i modified the videonewframe function like thisp  precodeprivate void videoNewFrame2object sender, NewFrameEventArgs eventArgs    if test.alreadyWorking  or if Singleton.Istance.alreadyWorking       test.alreadyWorking  true  or Singleton.Istance.alreadyWorking  true      Bitmap img  BitmapeventArgs.Frame.Clone     var result  reader.Decodeimg     if result  null          if DialogResult.OK  MessageBox.Showhello              do something         img.Dispose          test.alreadyWorking  false  or Singleton.Istance.alreadyWorking  false         else      return  codepre  pand i thought it was right but...unfortunately there still are more than one messageBox p  pAm i doing something wrong in the singleton implementation Thx again...p

Negative 106940 pCan I publish messages to several channels within the same command using the globstyle pattern, such as codeConnection.GetSubscriber.Publishroom, my messagecode and the message gets published to all channels that match the pattern p  pMaybe the above question makes little to no sense in case I misunderstand the basic pubsub pattern in Redis. My understanding is that each codeSubscribecode command establishes a channel on the Redis server and hence the channels Ids are known to the server and hence when the server receives a publish command that it should have the ability to fan out published messages to all channels that match the globstyle pattern. Please correct if I am wrong.p  pAdditional question, I assume I can also subscribe to multiple channels using the globstyle pattern, correctp  pThanksp

Negative 106940 pThis seems like a very simple task but I find it extremely hard to accomplish in Moq.  I have a repository that calls a unit of work to query a random picture from a database.  This query has one constraint the random picture from the database cannot be equal to the current picture being displayed.  Im building an NUnit test for the repository and Id like to mock the unit of work like sop  precode[TestFixture] public class WhenthenextrandompictureforTopSlidePictureshowhasbeenrequested      private Guid currentPictureID     private Picture randomPicture     private MockltIUnitOfWorkltGuidgtgt unitOfWorkMock      [SetUp]     public void Context              currentPictureID  Guid.NewGuid         randomPicture  new Picture  ID  Guid.NewGuid          unitOfWorkMock  new MockltIUnitOfWorkltGuidgtgt         TODO  Find out how to setup and verify expression when mocking method with equality comparison in a lambda expression.         unitOfWorkMock.Setupuow gt uow.GetRandomltPicturegtpic gt pic.ID  currentPictureID             .ReturnsrandomPicture           [Test]     public void ThePictureRepositorycanquerynextrandompicture              Arrange         var picRepo  new PictureRepositoryunitOfWorkMock.Object          Act         var randomPicture  picRepo.GetNextRandomPicturecurrentPictureID          Assert         unitOfWorkMock.Verifyuow gt              uow.GetRandomltPicturegtpic gt pic.ID  currentPictureID             , Times.Once          Assert.AreEqualrandomPicture, randomPicture       codepre  pIn the code above, the codeGetRandomltPicturegtExpressionltFuncltPicture, boolgtgtcode in the UnitOfWork is supposed to return any picture in the database whos Guid ID isnt equal to the current pics ID.  However, Setup method called from unitOfWorkMock returns null regardless of randomPictures value.  After much research I found the following procedurep  precodeunitOfWorkMock  new MockltIUnitOfWorkltGuidgtgt unitOfWorkMock.Setupuow gt uow.GetRandomltPicturegtIt.IsAnyltExpressionltFuncltPicture, boolgtgtgt     .ReturnsrandomPicture   var randomPicture  picRepo.GetNextRandomPicturecurrentPictureID  Assert unitOfWorkMock.Verifyuow gt      uow.GetRandomltPicturegtIt.IsAnyltExpressionltFuncltPicture, boolgtgtgt     , Times.Once codepre  pThis allows the test to pass.  BUT, I didnt test whether the picture returned from the db has the same Guid ID of the current picture ID passed in which is the key principle for even building the testp  pI love the Moq framework and prefer it over all other testing tools, but this seems like a massive breach of integrity as far as a unit testing platform goes.  Please, someone, inform me on what Im not seeing clearly and show me a simple and easy way to accomplish this seemingly simple taskp  pGratitudep  pUPDATEp  pThanks to StriplingWarrior, I was able to solve the problem His boolean algebra was wrong, but his answer was sound  I found these modifications to my above code to workp  precode        unitOfWorkMock  new MockltIUnitOfWorkltGuidgtgt         unitOfWorkMock.Setupuow gt uow.GetRandomltPicturegtIt.IsltExpressionltFuncltPicture, boolgtgtgte gt TestIdMatchExpressione             .ReturnsrandomPicture      private bool TestIdMatchExpressionExpressionltFuncltPicture, boolgtgt expr              var func  expr.Compile          Assert.IsFalsefuncnew Picture  ID  referencePictureID           return true                Assert          unitOfWorkMock.Verifyuow gt              uow.GetRandomltPicturegtIt.IsltExpressionltFuncltPicture, boolgtgtgte gt TestIdMatchExpressione              , Times.Once codepre  pThanks again StriplingWarriorp

Has anyone had better luck using it If so, could you point me towards or can you share any example snippets p  pIve spent a long time looking at and testing existing Python EXIF modules and so far all of them seem to be incomplete and unable to fully parse current EXIF image data. p  pI also looked at the Perl based EXIFTool which is a very complete tool, but when called from a Python shell call is 10x slower than calling native Python code to do the same. p  pThis BitStream module really seems like it is the Python tool to use to parse binary data with. p  pYet right now the learning curve has been steep. p  pThe biggest problem I am running up against is all the EXIF Image Spec docs just are not matching up to what I am seeing as I parse an image using BitStream.p  pIt feels like I am getting closer here, but could use a little advice or code snippets from some others who have spent time parsing image file EXIF headers using BitStream and Python to get this back on track.p

Negative 106940 pOur Herokuhosted Django app does some simple image processing on images our users upload to Amazon S3mostly resizing to the sizes we will display on the site. For this we use Pillow the fork of the Python Imaging Library, running in a Celery task.p  pWe have seen the time for this operation change from a fraction of a second to half a minute or more. My best guess for why is that we are now often getting memoryquota R14 conditions just because the application is bigger, which I would navely expect to make resizing particularly slow.p  pSo I am considering refactoring the tasks to use an external ImageMagick process to do the processing rather than inmemory PIL. The thinking is that this will at least guarantee that memory used during resizing is released when the codeconvertcode process terminates. p  pSo my question is, is this going to help Is ImageMagicks codeconvertcode going to have a smaller memory footprint than Pillowp

Here is my code.confcode filep  precodeNameVirtualHost 80  Flask Site ltVirtualHost 80gt    ServerName my.domain.comsuburl    WSGIDaemonProcess flasksuburl userwww groupwww    WSGIProcessGroup flasksuburl    WSGIScriptAlias suburl Usersmynamesuburlapp.wsgi    ltDirectory Usersmynamesuburlgt       WSGIApplicationGroup GLOBAL       Order deny,allow       Allow from all    ltDirectorygt ltVirtualHostgt   Web2py Site ltVirtualHost 80gt    ServerName my.domain.com    WSGIDaemonProcess web2pymain userwww groupwww    WSGIProcessGroup web2pymain    WSGIScriptAlias  Usersmynameweb2pywsgihandler.py    ltDirectory Usersmynameweb2pygt       AllowOverride None       Order Allow,Deny       Deny from all       ltFiles wsgihandler.pygt          Allow from all       ltFilesgt    ltDirectorygt ltVirtualHostgt codepre  pReordering the two VirtualHost definitions doesnt do anything. Removing the Web2py site allows me to access the Flask site.p  pId rather not combine them into a single VirtualHost, because that causes problems with the two applications sharing the same Python interpreter and certain C extensions are apparently flipping out.p  pIve changed the domain and a few other names to hide protected information. Im also excluding a few AliasMatch commands that handle serving the static subfolders. Theres also another VirtualHost for the SSH server on port 443, but I didnt include it because I expect that to not affect things.p  pSo how on earth do I make it so I can visit both sites, instead of the Web2py site swallowing everythingp

Then, a COUNT is generated from the final list of product IDs. This method can get slow when many nested queries are there.p  pIm working on a filtering system. So one or more filters and sub filters are selected and a COUNT is generated based on the current selection.p  pIt will be fantastic if I can create a SQL statement to return the number of products based on any number of sub filters without creating WHERE IN clauses.p  pThe above query can be simply made to use only the WHERE...AND clause. The problem lies in using something like the following as sub queries because it needs to select multiple conditionsp  precodeSELECT products.id FROM products    LEFT JOIN attributes ON attributes.productid  products.id   WHERE attributes.Label  Horsepower AND         attributes.Value gt 200 SELECT products.id FROM products    LEFT JOIN attributes ON attributes.productid  products.id   WHERE attributes.Label  Category AND         attributes.Value  Motors codepre

What I see is the followingp  precode[ ... idcolpartdesc,visvis,width500,ix3,descPart Desc., ... ] codepre  pOn the PHP file, I read the codePOSTcode value, and feed it back to the calling page to the code.saveresponsecode element in this example as a response.  What I get as a reply is thisp  precode[ ... idcolpartdesc,visvis,width270,ix3,descPart Desc., ... ] codepre  pAs you see, the codewidthcode value is different.  In fact, a value of code270code is the value that I sent the last time I pressed the code[Save]code button.  If I press code[Save]code again, the server will receive the code500code value sent in this call.  But it may be that the value of code500code is wrong by that time.p  pIf I press the code[Save]code button twice each time before changing the input, then the functionality works as expected.p  pAs you see, Ive disabled the codecachecode in the Ajax call, so I dont think this is the problem.p  pDoes anyone have an idea why I am experiencing this behaviourp  pemAside the original HTML page is generated using Smarty templating engine.  However, I have switched off caching in the Smarty engine too, so again, I dont think this is significant.  Also, the PHP file processing the Ajax call does not use a Smarty template.emp

Negative 106940 pIam implementing a solution to allow the user to receive push notifications only from the list of users he is following. I read about advanced targeting recipients when pushing messages. How should I setup up my installation object in order to receive posts only from the users Im following. Should I fetch the list of users he is following and setup the installation object. The issue is, Im using Parse login view controller and Ill get the list of users Iam following, only after I login. My second question is if the user will be able to get the push notifications if he is not logged in. My third question, is a new Parse installation object is created every time the app is launched The  requirement is I should see push notification from users Iam following. Please advise.p

No error report or registers are given and the game freezes at the current frame. The only way to exit the game is by signing out of Windows as no other process windows are usable. Sometimes there will be a 5 second delay between pressing the key and the game freezing without the message box being shown ingame.p  pIf codeshowDialogcode is called by specifying a codestatic stringcode while calling the function, e.gp  precodeshowDialog0, 2 , 2, MYTITLE, MY TEXT, OK, CLOSE codepre  pit will run correctly without freezing ever. I assume this rules out the possibility of my codeshowDialogcode function being incorrect.p  pMy question is, does the freezing sound like it is being caused by a memory corruption linked somehow to my use of codecharcode, codestdstringcode, code.cstrcode, etc... Does anyone have a suggestion as to how I can make this code work without freezing the gamep

Negative 106940 pI am trying to make a Navbar for my site that has a dropdown menu on the left, image in the center, and collapsable item on the right. I am using bootstrap with less to style the navbar, but I am having trouble.p  pI have searched Stack overflow looking for ways to make this work, like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19733447bootstrapnavbarwithleftcenterandrightaligneditemsthisa question, but the solutions there arent working for me. I cant seem to get my image to line up so that its horizontal axis is centered with the dropdown menu, collapsable item, and navbar container. When I try the solutions like in the previously mentioned link, taking the image out of the flow of the page by maxing its position fixed, it always appears below the navigation bar. I can fix this for my screen by messing with the CSS attributes, but as soon as I resize the window things look awful.p  pIs there a way possibly using less to style the bootstrap navbar so that no matter what the size of the window is, I have an item on the left, image in center, and item on the right, all sharing a common horizontal center axis with the navbar p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOkay, so I have changed my mind and decided to just add some links on the left, an image in the center still, and some links on the right. When the screen gets smaller, I want the links to collapse to the right offering a toggle button for a menu. The collapsing is working fine, but when the links are on the screen I want them to be horizontally centered in the nav bar, along with the image. The image right now is partially in the nav bar and partially out. I also want the image to slide to the left when the links collapse at smaller screen sizes.

Negative 106940 pI am studying for the Spring Core certification and I am unclear about how to configure strongSpring Securitystrong project into an application.p  pIn the course documentation I found these 2 code snippetsp  p1 strongConfiguration in web.xmlstrong p  precodeltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtspringSecurityFilterChainltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgt         org.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy     ltfilterclassgt ltfiltergt  ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtspringSecurityFilterChainltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt codepre  pI am pretty new to Java EE and also to Spring, so reading online I understand that this strongfilterstrong is something like a strongServletstrong that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource a servlet or static content, or on the response from a resource, or both. So if the standard strongServletstrong are objects used to handle request, create content and give a response for example the HttpServlet that handle HttpRequest, and give an HttpResponse containing the view to show the strongFilterstrong doesnt create content but elaborate resources.p  pSo, strongFiltersstrong are Java classes that can be used in Servlet Programming for the following purposesp  ul listrongTo intercept requests from a client before they access a resource at back endstrongli listrongTo manipulate responses from server before they are sent back to the clientstrongli ul  pand there exists various types of filters suggested by the specifications as the strongAuthentication Filtersstrong is this the type used for Spring Security for this taskp  pSo what exactly do the filter declared and mapped into the previous snippet do I think that it applies the strongspringSecurityFilterChainstrong to all the requests directed towards the strongstrong URL pattern that I think it means to all the servlet eventually declared that handle request.p  pOk, but what exactly is this strongspringSecurityFilterChainstrong . Looking here a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringsecuritysitedocs3.0.xreferencesecurityfilterchain.html relnofollowhttpdocs.spring.iospringsecuritysitedocs3.0.xreferencesecurityfilterchain.htmlap  pIt seems to me that Spring doesnt use a single filter, but that this strongspringSecurityFilterChainstrong maintains a filter chain internally so it uses more filters where each of the filters has a particular responsibility and filters are added or removed from the configuration depending on which services are required.p  pBut where exactly are these filter declaredp  p2 The second code snippet showed in the course slides is this one and I cant understand if it is relatedlinked to the previous one or notp  precodeltbeansgt     ltsecurityhttpgt         ltsecurityintercepturl patternaccountsedit accessROLEADMIN gt         ltsecurityintercepturl patternaccountsaccount accessROLEADMIN,ROLEUSER gt         ltsecurityintercepturl patternaccounts accessISAUTHENTICATEDFULLY gt         ltsecurityintercepturl patterncustomers accessISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY gt     ltsecurityhttpgt ltbeansgt codepre  pI understand that it intercepts urls and that these intercepted URLs are evaluated in the order listed first match is used, put specific matches first.p  pSo for example if the URL match with strongaccountseditstrong pattern it is applied the strongROLEADMINstrong access level. But what exactly is this Is this something that I have to write or is it something provided by Spring frameworkp  pThe other doubts are where are this second code snipped declared Into the XML Spring configuration file How is it related if a relationship exists with the first code snippetp  pTnxp
Negative 106940 pI have an app that makes a broadcast and receives message from multiple network nodesI also wrote these apps, so I can control what and how they send. While receiving this data, I need to separate each nodes message, so I can deserialize them to a meaningful Class that I have. Until now, I solved this by keeping every message of every client the same size, 267 bytes. However, this solution is obviously not correct. Another idea i have is to put 0 at the end of the byte array while sending, so my app can receive datagrams one by one.p  pCould anyone direct me to the right mindset with this problem p  pThanks.p  pEdit The question was not clear p  precodeUdp.receivePacketbindedPort, byteSize, discoveryTimeout codepre  pHere I am receiving message from multiple hosts, almost at the same time. So they are all stacked in the Udp buffer i suppose. I thought in order to receive datagram one by one and prevent ruining the byte order and integrity, I needed to know how much bytes to receive. My question was meant to learn about techniques to do that.p
Negative 106940 pI am trying to write a mac app which can read and write xml to files on the system. Im a beginner to Cocoa Im coming from iOS so this question may be very basic. Ive worked out that I have to have a document type app and that I read and write data using  override func dataOfTypetypeName String, error outError NSErrorPointer  NSData and override func readFromDatadata NSData, ofType typeName String, error outError NSErrorPointer  Bool p  pI believe my problem is with the Document Types or Exported UTI which are still a black art to mep  pIf I make the extensions in each anything other than xml lets say grf then things work fine. I can read and write xml data to files with the extension .grfp  pHowever if I set the extensions to xml then I can write data to an xml file, but when I try to read it, then xml files are disabled in the file navigator. So I cant select them and therefore cant read them.p  pI dont need help with parsing the xml once Ive got it. Its just understanding how I read the xml files.p

Negative 106940 pA short description of my problem is as followsp  pI developed a function that calls a CUDA kernel. My function receives a pointer to the host data buffers input and output of kernel, and has no control over the allocation of these buffers. p  p It is possible that the host data was allocated with either of malloc or cudaHostAlloc. My function is not specifically told which allocation method was used.p  pThe question is what is a feasible way for my function to figure out whether the host buffers are pinnedpagelocked cudaHostAlloc or not regular mallocp  pThe reason I am asking is that if they are not pagelocked, I would like to use cudaHostRegister to make them the buffers so, to make them amenable for streams.p  pI have tried three ways which have failed 1 Always apply cudaHostRegister this way is not good if the host buffers are already pinned 2 Run cudaPointerGetAttributes, and if the return error is cudaSuccess, then the buffers are already pinned, nothing to do else if cudaErrorInvalidValue, apply cudaHostRegister  for some reason this way results in the kernel execution returning an error 3 Run cudaHostGetFlags, and if return is not a success, then apply cudaHostRegister  same behavior as 2.p  pIn the case of 2 and 3, the error is invalid argumentnp  pNote that my code currently is not using streams, rather always calls cudaMemcpy for the entire host buffers. If I do not use any of the three above ways, my code runs to completion, regardless of whether the host buffer is pinned or not.p  pAny advice Many thanks in advance.p

cardImageView.setImageResourcecardGallery[imageId]        codepre  pp  pi think its because ive declared the old and new imageId values as the same, but if I were to change them to say imageId and newimageId, this would change the conditions in my code where I call for values to be compared to imageId. Thanksp

Negative 106940 pI have simple dynamic web project in eclipse to run jsf 2 mojarra 2.2.8 web application using richfaces 4.4.5.Final ui component library.

I blame myself not richfaces UI component. I had used it many years ago and it had served me well. However I switched to primefaces ui component library after struggling with richfaces for a few days. After fixing many common issues people run into for implementing jsf 2  ui component library, in the end it worked. p  pOne thing I would like to share with others who may be interested on this matter, I got plain HTML at first time for implementing emprimefaces panelMenuem. However when I used chromes developer tools to see if there are any errors, sure enough there was. After reading following thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14553417uncaughtreferenceerrorprimefacesisnotdefinedUncaught Reference Error PrimeFaces is not defineda from stackoverflow, I was able to enable panelMenu just fine. p  pFor emrichfaces panelMenuem, no errors were detected.p  pI hope this statement does not discourage people from using richfaces. I believe that it is one of great open source UI component libraries. Hope I could figure it out someday why I was failed to implement it in my environment. p

So, in my code, I have two different classes, one called mainScene and one called tieScene.

How do I incorporate the information for playerArray and enemyArray from class mainScene, and use these values in class tieScene p  pOne thing I tried was subclassing tieScene as part of mainScene as follows p  precode class tieScene mainScene ... codepre  pThis allowed me to use the playerArray and enemyArray in class tieScene.

Negative 106940 pIm trying to make a Java project that pinpoints the place on a image of a map, when given coordinates taken from Google Maps. p  pIve tried using the topleft corner of the image place that has highest latitude, and the lowest longitude, as an some kind of an reference point, which would be 0,0 point on the map image, and than Ive tried to calculate every place on the map based on that reference point. However, this method proved inaccurate, probably because of the curvature of the Earth mind that the map Im working with Serbia covers area of 4 latitude, and 4 longitude.p  pIve seen couple of answers talking about converting into Mercator projection, but they are not very clear to me, because they are not covering a case similar to mine, and are not written in Java.p  pWhat can I do to pinpoint those points more accurately 3km would be accurate enoughp

Negative 106940 pI am a developer of a library and our old code uses codesscanfcode and codesprintfcode to readwrite a variety of internal types fromto strings. We have had issues with users who used our library and had a locale that was different from the one we based our XML files on C locale. In our case this resulted in incorrect values parsed from those XML files and those submitted as strings in runtime. The locale may be changed by a user directly but can also be changed without the knowledge of the user. This can happen if the localechanges occurs inside another library, such as GTK, which was the perpetrator in one bug report. Therefore, we obviously want to remove any dependency from the locale to permanently free ourselves from these issues.p  pI have already read other questions and answers in the context of floatdoubleint... especially if they are separated by a character or located inside brackets, but so far the proposed solutions I found were not satisfying to us. Our requirements arep  ol lipNo dependencies on libraries other than the standard library. Using anyting from boost is therefore, for example, not an option.pli lipMust be threadsafe. This is meant in specific regarding the locale, which can be changed globally. This is really awful for us, as therefore a thread of our library can be affected by another thread in the users program, wich may also be running code of a completely different library. Anything affected by codesetlocalecode directly is therefore not an option. Also, setting the locale before starting to readwrite and setting it back to the original value thereafter is not a solution due to race conditions in threads.pli lipWhile efficiency is not the topmost priority 1 amp 2 are, it is still definitely of our concern, as strings may be read and written in runtime quite frequently, depending on the users program. The faster, the better.pli ol  pstrongEditstrong As an additional note codeboostlexicalcastcode is not guaranteed to be unaffected by the locale source a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18980423localeinvariantguaranteeofboostlexicalcastLocale invariant guarantee of boostlexicalcastltgta. So that would not be a solution even without requirement 1.p  pI gathered the following information so farp  ul liFirst of all, what I saw being suggested a lot is using boosts lexicalcast but unfortunately this is not an option for us as at all, as we cant require all users to also link to boost and because of the lacking localesafety, see above. I looked at the code to see if we can extract anything from it but I found it difficult to understand and too large in length, and most likely the big performancegainers are using localedependent functions anyways.li liMany functions introduced in C11, such as codestdtostringcode, codestdstodcode, codestdstofcode, etc. depend on the global locale just the way sscanf and sprintf do, which is extremely unfortunate and to me not understandable, considering that stdthread has been added.li licodestdstringstreamcode seems to be a solution in general, since it is threadsafe in the context of the locale, but also in general if guarded right. However, if it is constructed freshly every time it can be slow good comparison a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1550dochtmlboostlexicalcastperformance.html relnofollowhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1550dochtmlboostlexicalcastperformance.htmla. I assume this can be solved by having one such stream per thread configured and available, clearing it each time after usage. However, a problem is that it doesnt solve formats as easily as codesscanfcode does, for example code  g , g  code.li ul  pcodesscanfcode patterns that we, for example, need to be able to read arep  ul licode  g , g codeli licode   g , g  ,  g , g  codeli licode  top  g , g  , left  g , g  , bottom  g , g  , right  g , g codeli ul  pWriting these with stringstreams seems no big deal, but reading them seems problematic, especially considering the whitespaces.p  pShould we use codestdregexcode in this context or is this overkill Are stringstreams a good solution for this task or is there any better way to do this given the mentioned requirements Also, are there any other problems in the context of threadsafety and locales that I have not considered in my question  especially regarding the usage of stdstringstreamp

Negative 106940 h1The ploth1  pThere is a rather complicatedly formatted string, like theres no such readable regex that parses it. And the aim is to get a specific substring for example, and to get its original position. That substring is reached after parsing a bit, like trimming, removing the beginning something and searching the nth element for example. I just want to demonstrate you the complexity with this example, otherwise its pretty general.p  pFor demonstration, see this rudimentary example. The way it is isnt really important, just to reach a pretty complicated parse model. Obviously, there can be more rule and you can write a simplier model as well.p  ul liFirstBlockIndex1, Index2 SecondBlock ThirdBlockli li FirstBlock Index1,Index2 SecondBlockli liFirstBlock SecondBlock ThirdBlock FourthBlockli ul  pIve tried to make as random as it could be. The parsing model is likep  precodestring text   FirstBlock Index1,Index2 SecondBlock  text  text.Trim  if text.First        text  text.SubString1, text.Length  2   text  text.Trim  string firstBlock  text.Splitnew char[]   ,  [0]  text  text.Remove0, firstBlock.Length.Trim  string indices    if text.First        indices  text.Splitnew char[]  ,  [0]     text  text.Remove0, indices.Length.Trim   string[] blocks  text.Split  codepre  h1The easy wayh1  pThere is a way that is pretty easy to implement and straightforward. But does not give you the correct result sometimes. That way you parse the string and get the substring and then you make a research, for example codestring.IndexOfcode and get the position. But if there are two match for example, you are given the first one even though it is not sure you wanted that one.p  h1My notionh1  pThe way I think is quite elegant but still not consummate is to index the characters of the string at the beginning, then parse it, and eventually you end up with the proper characters and their position also. My problem there is that then you cant really use the functions the library gives, and I dont know a way to do that. Using the snippet abovep  precodeListltTupleltint, chargtgt indexedText  text                 .Selectch, index gt new Tupleltint, chargtindex, ch                 .ToList codepre  pAnd with this structure you can still process the string without library methods but you are given the position indices eventually. For example, trimp  precodeindexedText  indexedText                 .SkipWhileindexedChar gt char.IsWhiteSpaceindexedChar.Item2                 .ToList codepre  h1The actual questionh1  pThe question can either be a new solution or the way you can use library methods with indexed strings. The aim is to get the indices back after parsing a string. It is possible that there is a very simple way that is just out of my scope but I havent found a proper solution yet. The solution I dont want is to simplify the parsing system, as I said it is just for demonstration.p

Negative 106940 pThe high level problem is that I want to know if the user is present for a given time period in the past. This can be solved when the computer is awake by tracking codeUSERIDLEcode and codeUSERPRESENTcode events. p  pHowever, Ive found that when the laptop lid is closed, it does not fire the codeUSERIDLEcode event, nor does it fire codeUSERPRESENTcode when the laptop lid is opened. The laptop can be closed for hours and neither events are ever dispatched. p  pSo how can I know if the user is present Ive looked into all sorts of events to capture the laptop being suspended, including codeSUSPENDcode, codeDEACTIVATEcode, etc, but none do what I want.p  pFor example, I have this test codep  precodevar logFileFile  File.documentsDirectory.resolvePathevents.log  var appNativeApplication  NativeApplication.nativeApplication app.addEventListenerEvent.USERIDLE, logEvent app.addEventListenerEvent.USERPRESENT, logEvent app.addEventListenerEvent.SUSPEND, logEvent app.addEventListenerEvent.EXITING, logEvent app.addEventListenerEvent.ACTIVATE, logEvent app.addEventListenerEvent.DEACTIVATE, logEvent app.addEventListenerInvokeEvent.INVOKE, logEvent  logEventnew Eventstarted  function logEventeEventvoid      var logString  n  e.type   at   new Date      var fileStreamFileStream  new FileStream     fileStream.openlogFile, FileMode.APPEND     fileStream.writeUTFByteslog     fileStream.close  codepre  pIf I run this app, change window focus away then back, close the laptop, then open the laptop, I get this outputp  precodestarted at Tue Sep 1 092911 GMT0400 2015 invoke at Tue Sep 1 092911 GMT0400 2015 activate at Tue Sep 1 092912 GMT0400 2015 deactivate at Tue Sep 1 092913 GMT0400 2015 activate at Tue Sep 1 092913 GMT0400 2015 deactivate at Tue Sep 1 092917 GMT0400 2015 activate at Tue Sep 1 092931 GMT0400 2015 codepre  pAs you can see this doesnt seem to help me figure out if the user is present laptop awake or not. There are no codeUSERIDLEcode or codeUSERPRESENTcode events, and the codeACTIVATEcode and codeDEACTIVATEcode events happen even when the user is present. p  pIs there any way to know if the laptop is suspended Or to know if the user is presentp  hr  pstrongEditstrong I guess that I can poll the system clock.
