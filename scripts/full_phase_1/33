Positive 33 pSo Im implementing a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiContinuedfraction relnofollowcontinued fractiona library for handling a subset of a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiQuadraticinteger relnofollowquadratic integersa and a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiRationalnumber relnofollowrational numbersa.  Continued fraction terms are represented by unsigned integers.  Ive noticed the following general patterns when working with continued fractionsp  ol liMost terms are small single digit numbers, with 1 being the most common.li liSome terms can be enormous, the largest possible for my application is 366 bits, but these are extremely rare.li liA large term represents an especially good number approximation, which means there are usually fewer terms overall for a large fraction.li liThe worst possible continued fraction is the golden ratio, and a rational approximation of that with 366 bits of precision corresponds to roughly 525 1s in a row.li liRandom rational numbers do not generally have large runs of the same number, but may have two to four in a row, with 1 again the most common.li ol  pSo I have a limit on both the number of terms and the size of a term, with the number of terms roughly inversely proportional to their size.  So storing these terms in machine words or even bytes is usually very wasteful of space, and I still need to handle multiword arithmetic in the worst case.  Given the roughly inverse relationship between term size and number of terms which both also depend on the size of the fractions numerator and denominator, Ive been trying to find or come up with a good compression scheme so that I dont waste so much space storing the integer terms.p  pIve considered a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiHuffmancoding relnofollowHuffman encodinga, as the speed of encoding and decoding is nice, but Im not sure how to come up with the probabilities for the code values.  I have a vague intuition that a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSternE28093Brocottree relnofollowSternBrocot Treesa might offer a hint, as they are a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiBinarytree relnofollowbinary treesa with a direct relationship to continued fractions.p  pDoes anyone know of a good compression approach for handling lots of small numbers with occasional huge ones where runs of the same number are typically short but might be long in rare cases  In particular I need to be able to encode and decode fairly fast say Onlgn is the absolute worst speed I can tolerate, with On or better preferable, and be able to get at the position of individual terms so that I know which term number Im operating on fourth term, fifth term, etc.p  pAlso, Im not interested in using any third party real number or continued fraction libraries.  Ive looked at several and they are either insufficient or overkill for my needs, and Id like the experience of coding this up myself for my own edification.p  pstrongemUpdateemstrongp  pIve also learned of a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiGaussE28093Kuzmindistribution relnofollowGaussKuzmin distributiona which gives the probability distribution of a particular continued fraction term of codekcode for a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.  It is p  pcodePk  lg1.0  1.0k  1.02code in Python pseudocode, where lg is the base 2 logarithm.  This is the limit as codekcode approaches infinity, so my case is somewhat more restricted though code2366code is still huge.  a hrefhttpwww.linas.orgmathentropy.pdf relnofollowThe Entropy of Continued Fractionsa by Linas Vepstas gives the information entropy of GaussKuzmin distribution as approximately 3.43 bits.  My maximum denominator is large enough that the information entropy of my continued fractions is probably close to that limit, though the graph in the linked article shows the limit is approached quite slowly and so is different for relatively small denominators.p

Positive 33 pIm new to these concepts and currently trying to understand what business and application logic is in my application that im developing using MVC concept.p  pIt seems to me that most of the people agree on the fact that application logic belongs to controller and business logic belongs to model. And that is basically the reason i want to be able to determine what is what, so keep that in mind while reading the question to not miss the point.p  h2Business Logich2  pOne of the approaches ive heard is to consider business logic as more of a thing that can be described by people who have nothing to do with programming and just trying to explain how everything would work. So that would basically involve various data to be displayed and how that data is processedright.   p  pSo for example designing calculator application business people would say that were going to have two numbers at our input and when user presses Calculate button we would perform certain actions with given inputsfor simplicity lets say add them, and output the result into the Result label. p  h2Application Logich2  pNow application logic is more of a thing that developers care about and more of a thing that business people tend to omit when describing a project of some kind.    p  h2Main Problem and Questionh2  pNow heres the main problem if youre using the same approach for determining where is business and where is application logic. Notice that i didnt specified what emactuallyem application logic involves. And that is because if you think about it this way it really becomes unclear what application logic may or may not involve since different business people may or may not include things of all kinds while describing some app which makes this approach impossible to use practically without some kinds of restrictions.  p  pAnd my question being, what kinds of restrictions should be applied to this approach for having the ability to properly determine where is application and where is business logic strongorstrong what approach should be used instead Also is it really correct to say that controller is for application logic and model is for business or can they share some parts of both and if yes then in which wayp  h2Examples read this section if question is still unclear for youh2  pExamples from which obscurity comes are  p  ul liwhile describing, business people may or may not mention  ul liform validationli lidatabase interactionli lireally any kind of data manipulation that should bother developer but mensioned by nondevelopers because they realize it is needed for system to function properly li ulli ul  pLets come back to out calculator application. Description given by nondevelopers could be translated into model in pseudocode like this  p  precodeClass CalculatorModel extends Model    public int firstNumber   public int secondNumber   public int result    public void calculate          thisgtresult  thisgtfirstNumber  thisgtsecondNumber     codepre  pThen controller would look like thisp  precodeClass CalculatorController extends Controller    public void onCalculateButtonClick        thisgtmodelgtcalculate     codepre  pLets ignore that business said that on click we should perform calculation and we put that part in controller which is for application logic, because MVC states that controllers must handle these kinds of things, we have different problem anyway  where do we update codefirstcode and codesecondcode codeNumbercode fields If this approach is used then it simply becomes unclear since different people might and might not mention it, which makes it neither business, nor application logic or both of them which of course doesnt make any sense.  p  pIf we imagine business didnt mentioned that were updating any numbers before calculationbut we realize that it has to be done for any calculation to occur, then we wouldve determined that it is indeed application logic and wouldve placed code inside the controllerp  precodeClass CalculatorController extends Controller    public void updateNumbers        thisgtmodelgtfirstNumber  input1gttext     thisgtmodelgtsecondNumber  input2gttext      public void onCalculateButtonClick       thisgtupdateNumbers     thisgtmodelgtcalculate    codepre  pBut if business himself mentioned that we should update the first and the second number before doing the calculation that wouldve been considered as business logic and accordingly wouldve been put into the model. At that point we have 2 another options, which are adding the field update directly into codecalculatecode method, or creating separate method in our model so we can call it from controller before calling codecalculatecode.  p  pBusiness also may or may not mention if user input should be validated before performing any actions, but it would make calculation impossible if user gives at input two nondigits so you have to implement it and you have to know where to put it.  p  pAnd lets say one day your clients tell you that they want to store every result of a calculation somewhere and then be able to watch it somehow. That would mean you should send requests to database, but since they didnt exactly mentioned that it has to be database it becomes unclear once again where to put code.  p  pI hope ive made myself clear and you can understand the problem fully to be able to help andor maybe give your opinion on proper way of designing applications using ModelViewController.p

It was not codep1code by observation and codep2code will only change state to codetruecode at codet  30code, therefore it was codep3code.li liNo variables are observable It is known that codep1code changed state to codefalsecode at time codet  30code, codep2code changed state to codefalsecode at codet  75code, and codep3code changed state to false at codet  80code. A variable changes state. At codet  1code codep2code is observed to have a value of codetruecode. Because codep1code is still codefalsecode, and codep2code has been observed to be codetruecode, it should be inferred that codep3code is codefalsecode, and will change state back to codetruecode at codet  60code.li licodep1code and codep2code are observable. It is known that codep3code changed state to codefalsecode at time codet  70code. No variable changes state. It should be inferred that codep3code is true, since it would have changed from codefalsecode to codetruecode at codet  10code, and if it had changed from codetruecode to codefalsecode, we would have been informed of a variable changing state.li ul  pOne approach I have tried involved iterating over each of the variables on each notification of a variable state change, and ruling out the possible matches based onp  ul liwhether it was visible and had not changed stateli liwhether its last state change is known and not far enough in the past for it to have changed back.li ul  pthen, for the leftover variables for which state is known, determining an upper and lower bound on their last variable change based on when the variable was last observed in a particular state, when the variable may have changed state back, from codefalsecode to codetruecode, etc. Then if there exists only one variable change event within that bounds, it should be the one corresponding to the variable. It ended up being too cumbersome and I didnt continue. Every line was a burden because it seemed as if the number of possible combinations of states was too large and I would not take something into account.p  pIs the above approach a reasonable one to take, given the problem statement Is there a general way that problems like this are modeled that allows them to be solved more elegantlyp

Positive 33 pThe PRNG I wrote has a period of 264. When I use a spinlock to protect it from 4 threads, It runs twice slower than when there is a single thread. A mutex appears better at making things slower. So I decided to have separate generators per thread, but the problem here is that when the seeds are too close, The same series of random numbers will appear again and again each in a different thread. Im not 100 sure how bad this will affect my simulation, but Id like to avoid having very closely seeded PRNGs.p  pMaybe my original question was too less specified to get an easy solution. Below I posted the PRNG that Im using. It performs very well in statistical tests such as Diehard or FIPS, but I really cannot prove why as Im no expert in this area. I need a way to find good seeds for 4 or more generators running in parallel. With 2 seeds, the worst pair of seeds are the same seeds so that 2 threads are getting the same sequence of random numbers. The best pair of seeds will produce two sequences with no overlapping part.p  pI see that it gets harder to find the best set of seeds as the number of parallel generators or the number of random numbers generated or both get greater. There will be at least 4 threads and at least a billion random numbers generated per task.p  pI simplest solution I can reach is periodic reseeding. Sometimes I may get a bad set of seeds, but it will soon get replaced by a better one after a periodic reseed.p  pIs there a general solution to my problem that can be applied to any PRNG Or at least something available to the generator Im currently using I can possibly change my PRNG, if theres one which is specifically designed and well suited for parallel random number generation.p  precodestatic threadlocal unsigned long long n  void seedRandunsigned long long s    n  s   unsigned genRandvoid    n  123456789   n  n gtgt 3   n  n ltlt 5   return n  n gtgt 7  codepre

Positive 33 pWhen doing IoC, I think that I understand its use for getting the desired application level functionality by composing the right parts, and the benefits for testability. But at the microlevel, I dont quite understand how to make sure that an object gets dependencies injected that it can actually work with. My example for this is a codeBackupMakercode for a database.p  pTo make a backup, the database needs to be exported in a specific format, compressed using a specific compression algorithm, and then packed together with some metadata to form the final binary. Doing all of these tasks seems to be far from a single responsibility, so I ended up with two collaborators a codeDatabaseExportercode and a codeCompressorcode. p  pThe codeBackupMakercode doesnt really care how the database is exported e.g. using IPC to a utility that comes with the database software, or by doing the right API calls but it does care a lot about the result, i.e. it needs to be a thiskindofdatabase backup in the first place, in the transportable version agnostic format, either of which I dont really know how to wrap in a contract. Neither does it care if the compressor does the compression in memory or on disk, but it has to be BZip2.p  pIf I give the codeBackupMakercode the wrong kinds of exporter or compressor, it will still produce a result, but it will be corrupt  itll look like a backup, but it wont have the format that it should have. It feels like no other part of the system can be trusted to give it those collaborators, because the codeBackupMakercode wont be able to guarantee to do the right thing itself its job from my perspective is to produce a valid backup and it wont if the circumstances aint right, and worse, it wont know about it. At the same time, even when writing this, it seems to me that Im saying something stupid now, because the whole point of single responsibilities is that every piece should do its job and not worry about the jobs of others. If it were that simple though, there would be no need for contracts  a hrefhttpwww.jbrains.caJ.B. Rainsbergera just taught me there is. FYI, I sent him this question directly, but I havent got a reply yet and more opinions on the matter would be great.p  pIntuitively, my favorite option would be to make it impossible to combine classesobjects in an invalid way, but I dont see how to do that. Should I write horrendously specific interface names, like codeIDatabaseExportInSuchAndSuchFormatProducercode and codeICompressorUsingAlgorithmXAndParametersYcode and assume that no classes implement these if they dont behave as such, and then call it a day since nothing can be done about outright lying code Should I go as far as the mundane task of dissecting the binary format of my databases exports and compression algorithms to have contract tests to verify not only syntax but behavior as well, and then be sure but how to use only tested classes Or can I somehow redistribute the responsibilities to make this issue go away Should there be another class whose responsibility it is to compose the right lower level elements Or am I even decomposing too muchp  h2Rewordingh2  pI notice that much attention is given to this very particular example. My question is more general than that, however. Therefore, for the final day of the bounty, I will try to summarize is as follows.p  pWhen using dependency injection, by definition, an object depends on other objects for what it needs. In many book examples, the way to indicate compatibility  the capability to provide that need  is by using the type system e.g. implementing an interface. Beyond that, and especially in dynamic languages, contract tests are used. The compiler if present checks the syntax, and the contract tests that the programmer needs to remember about verify the semantics. So far, so good. However, sometimes the semantics are still too simple to ensure that some classobject is usable as a dependency to another, or too complicated to be described properly in a contract.p  pIn my example, my class with a dependency on a database exporter considers anything that implements codeIDatabaseExportInSuchAndSuchFormatProducercode and returns bytes as valid since I dont know how to verify the format. strongIs very specific naming and such a very rough contract the way to go or can I do better than thatstrong Should I turn the contract test into an integration test Perhaps integration test the composition of all three Im not really trying to be generic but emamem trying to keep responsibilities separate and maintain testability.p

Positive 33 pIve a need for 3D triangletriangle collision detection using integer math only. Unfortunately, Im not in a position where I can use 64bit integers only 32bit and my vertex values can be larger than 24bit values.

Positive 33 pI have been looking into some strategies for an interprocess shared memory data structure that allows growing and shrinking its committed capacity on windows by using a chain of memory chunks. p  pOne possible way is to use strongpagefile backed named memory mapsstrong as the chunk memory. An advantage of this strategy is the possibility to use codeSECRESERVEcode to reserve a big chunk of memory address space and incrementally allocate it using codeVirtualAlloccode with codeMEMCOMMITcode. Disadvantages appear to be a the requirement to have codeSeCreateGlobalPrivilegecode permissions to allow using a shareable name in the codeGlobalcode namespace and b the fact that all committed memory contributes to the system commit charge.p  pTo circumvent these disadvantages, I started investigating the use of strongtemporary file backed memory mapsstrong. I.e. memory maps over files created using the codeFILEFLAGDELETEONCLOSE  FILEATTRIBUTETEMPORARYcode flags combination. This appears to be a recommended strategy that according to e.g. a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comblarryostermanarchive20040419116084.aspx relnofollowthis blog posta should prevent flushing the mapped memory to disk unless memory pressure causes dirty mapped pages to be paged out.  p  pI am however observing that closing the mapfile handle before the owning process exits, causes dirty pages to be flushed to disk. This occurs even if the viewfile handle is not the one through which the dirty pages were created and when these viewsfile handles were opened after the pages were dirtied in a different view. p  pIt appears that changing the order of disposal i.e. unmapping the view first or closing the file handle first has some impact on when the disk flush is initiated, but not on the fact that flushing takes place. p  pSo my questions arep  blockquote   ul   liIs there some way to use temporary file backed memory maps and prevent them from flushing dirty pages when the mapfile is closed, taking into account that multiple threads within a processmultiple processes may have open handlesviews to such a fileli   liIf not, what iscould be the reason for the observed behaviorli   liDo you know of an alternative strategy that I may have overlookedli   ul blockquote  pstrongUPDATEstrong Some additional info When running the arena1 and arena2 parts of the sample code below in two separate independent processes, with arena1 being the process that creates the shared memory regions and arena2 the one that opens them, the following behavior is observed for mapschunks that have dirty pagesp  ul liIf closing the view before the file handle in the arena1 process, it flushes each of these chunks to disk in what seems a partially synchronous process i.e. it blocks the disposing thread for several seconds, strongindependentstrong of whether or not the arena2 process was started.li liIf closing the file handle before the view, disk flushes only occur for those mapschunks that are closed in the arena1 process while the arena2 process still has an open handle to those chunks, and they appear to be asynchronous, i.e. not blocking the application thread.li ul  pRefer to the c sample code below that allows reproducing the problem on my system x64, Win7p  precodestatic uint64t startts static uint64t elapsed      return GetTickCount64  startts   class PageArena  public     typedef uint8t pointer      PageArenaint id, const char basename, sizet pagesz, sizet chunksz, sizet nchunks, bool disposehandlefirst          idid, basenamebasename, pgszpagesz, disposehandlefirstdisposehandlefirst          for sizet i  0 i lt nchunks i              chunks.pushbacknew Chunki, basename, chunksz, disposehandlefirst                  PageArena          for auto i  0 i lt chunks.size i              if chunks[i]                 releasechunki                  stdcout ltlt [ ltlt elapsed ltlt ] arena  ltlt id ltlt  destructed ltlt stdendl           pointer alloc          auto ptr  chunks.backgtallocpgsz         if ptr              chunks.pushbacknew Chunkchunks.size, basename, chunks.backgtcapacity, disposehandlefirst             ptr  chunks.backgtallocpgsz                  return ptr          sizet numchunks          return chunks.size          void releasechunksizet ndx          delete chunks[ndx]         chunks[ndx]  nullptr         stdcout ltlt [ ltlt elapsed ltlt ] chunk  ltlt ndx ltlt  released from arena  ltlt id ltlt stdendl       private     struct Chunk      public         Chunksizet ndx, const stdstringamp basename, sizet size, bool disposehandlefirst              mapptrnullptr, tailnullptr,              handleINVALIDHANDLEVALUE, size0,              disposehandlefirstdisposehandlefirst               name  nameforbasename, ndx             if handle  createtempfilename, size  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE                 handle  opentempfilename, size             if handle  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE                  size  size                 auto maphandle  CreateFileMappingAhandle, nullptr, PAGEREADWRITE, 0, 0, nullptr                 tail  mapptr  pointerMapViewOfFilemaphandle, FILEMAPALLACCESS, 0, 0, size                 CloseHandlemaphandle  no longer needed.

Positive 33 pI was asked this problem during an interview. p  pYou are standing at 0 and you have to reach a position X. You can take a jump of upto D 1 to D. If X  D, its obvious that you cant reach the position X at initial jump.p  pNow there are tiles appearing at random position every second from 1 to N. This is given as a zero indexed array A[k], where A[k] represents the the position of tile appearing at kth second. You have to find out, at which second it becomes possible for you to reach or cross the destination X.p  pIf its possible at initial or after A[0] then return 0, or return the minimum second. If its not possible even after all tiles, then return 1.p  pConstraints 1 lt N lt 100,000p  p1 lt D lt 100,000p  p1 lt X lt 100,000p  p1 lt A[i] lt Xp  pEg.p  pX  7, D3p  pA  1,3,1,4,2,5p  pthen answer is 3. Since at 3rd second tile appear at position 4 and it becomes possible to reach X7. Its not possible at any second before that. p  pI understand thats a too much worded problem but I can definitely clear anything if I couldnt communicate well. p  pThe catch is that expected time complexity is ON and you can use extra space OX. p  pI found a solution which is On  log n  log n. That is to binary search over second and get first [1..mid] elements, sort them by positions and verify for solution. It seemed to pass the test cases but it is not linear.p  pI tried hard but couldnt find any ON solution. Can you please help me   p

Negative 33 pSo, I got this idea that Id try to prototype an experimental user interface using OpenGL and some physics. I know little about either of the topics, but am pretty experienced with programming languages such as C, Java and C. After some initial research, I decided on using Python with EclipsePyDev and Qt, both new to me, and now have four different topics to learn more or less simultaneously.p  pIve gotten quite far with both OpenGL and Python, but while Python and its ecosystem initially seemed perfect for the task, Ive now discovered some serious drawbacks. Bad API documentation and lacking code completion due to dynamic typing, having to import every module I use in every other module gets tedious when having one class per module, having to select the correct module to run the program, and having to wait 30 seconds for the program to start and obscure the IDE before being notified of many obvious typos and other mistakes. It gets really annoying really fast. Quite frankly, i dont get what all the fuzz is about. Lambda functions, list comprehensions etc. are nice and all, but theres certainly more important things.p  pSo, unless anyone can resolve at least some of these annoyances, Python is out. C is out as well, for obvious reasons, and C is out, mainly for lack of portability. This leaves Java and JOGL as an attractive option, but Im also curious about Ruby and Groovy. Id like your opinion on these and others though, to keep my from making the same mistake again.p  pThe requirements arep  ul liKeeping the hell out of my way.li liGood code completion. Complete method signatures, including data types and parameter names.li liGood OpenGL support.li liQt support is preferable.li liObject Orientedli liSuitable for RAD, prototypingli liCrossplatformli liPreferably OpenSource, but at least free.li ul

Negative 33 pThe Java WebStart application I am working on uses SWT for GUI, and I have recently realized a small but annoying problem. When I choose an action that uses a codeFileDialogcode i.e. save the image, the user interface freezes immediately after the dialog closes.  The image is saved, and can be opened with a default image viewer without any problem, but the application is nonresponsive from then on, and I am forced to kill the application.p  pI noticed that the result is the same when try to open a file using a codeFileDialogcode, if I instead open the same file by sending it as an argument by using the jnlp file, it works fine, so I dont think its a problem with the local filesystem. p  pI have tried to replicate the problem on windows only to see that it works fine on Win 7. As a second attempt to troubleshoot, I tried to save an image from the local version of the application in other words, nonJWS and that works fine as well... p  pI was suspecting a permissions problem on the jnlp file, but allpermissions are given to the application, and signatures are all ok as well the fact that the app starts points to that. Besides the image file is written anyways, so it cant really be a permission thing.p  pAny ideasp  pstrongUPDATEstrong It appears as there the problem doesnt only depend on FileDialog but any kind of graphical user interaction.

Negative 33 pAfter doing a lot of research on how mobile phone applications and games work i noticed one thing that was mentioned a lot, particularly with Android development, and that is ad integration.  I was a little confused how the ads work and how it benefits the developer.  I decided to ask my friend to use his phone and played Angry Birds, launched a task killer application, and played another game that was a free edition.  I noticed that in the application the ad was in the bottom of the screen far from any actual obstruction to the use of the program, but on the game it was ether on the far left or in the case of Angry Birds, it was in the top right.  Nothing appeared to be obstructed when the add would show up.p  pMy question is for a better understanding of how the ad way of income and development works  Does the ad bring income to the developer based upon how many users clicked it  Do i have control of the ad and its size and where it is located  In the case of angry birds it did not appear to be to bad.  So besides the overly verbose, above, how much control does a developer have if they choose to integrate ads into their game or applicationp  pThank you for your help and helping me understand how mobile phone markets work.p

Negative 33 pId like to merge two arrays with each otherp  precodefiltered  array1 gt a, 3 gt c changed  array2 gt b, 3 gt c codepre  pWhereas the merge should include all elements of codefilteredcode and all those elements of codechangedcode that have a corresponding key in codefilteredcodep  precodemerged  array1 gt a, 3 gt c codepre  pcodearraymergefiltered, changedcode would add the additional keys of codechangedcode into codefilteredcode as well. So it does not really fit.p  pI know that I can use codekeys  arrayintersectkeyfiltered, changedcode to get the keys that exist in both arrays which is already half of the work.p  pHowever Im wondering if there is any native function that can reduce the codechangedcode array into an array with the codekeyscode specified by codearrayintersectkeycode I know I can use codearrayfiltercode with a callback function and check against codekeyscode therein, but there is probably some other purely native function to extract only those elements from an array of which the keys can be specifiedp  pIm asking because the native functions are often much faster than codearrayfiltercode with a callback.p

Negative 33 pIm planning an Android app for some kind of information service.p  pClients can query some text information from the server and they can add text information too. The concept is the followingp  ul liThe central instance is an apache web server with php running on it.li liWhen the Android app contacts the server the first time for example when the client queries the current information, the client ip address should be registered on the php script running on the server and should receive the latest data.li liWhen any registered client adds text data, every registered client should get the information to update the data to see the latest text data.li liThis should be managed by an udp response to the ip addresses of all clients android apps. That means that every IP address whichbr has been attached that means registered should be informed.li ul  pI though about implementing this with the observer pattern SplObserver and SplSubject at server side. Unfortunately Im not very familiar with the technical background of php. So I wonder how an observer can work with php at all.p  pDoes php use some kind of instances although it is an interpreted language to remember the state of the observer My thought is that the php script runs at this time when it is invoked and forgets its state immediately. That is actually what client server communication is about.p  pSo can anybody explain to me how an observer should work in this case, respectively how can I guarantee that the registered clients dont get lost by using the php observer pattern      p  pIf this doesnt work, I would just save the ip addresses into a database to not forget it and implement it as simple database query.p

Negative 33 pstrongEDITstrong Ive reorganized this question to reflect the new information that since became available.p  pThis question is based on the responses to a question by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers154467viliamViliama concerning Guava Maps use of lazy eviction a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5899383lazinessofevictioninguavasmapsLaziness of eviction in Guava39s mapsap  pPlease read this question and its response first, but essentially the conclusion is that Guava maps do not asynchronously calculate and enforce eviction.  Given the following mapp  precodeConcurrentMapltString, MyObjectgt cache  new MapMaker         .expireAfterAccess10, TimeUnit.MINUTES         .makeMap codepre  pOnce ten minutes has passed following access to an entry, it will still not be evicted until the map is touched again. Known ways to do this include the usual accessors  codegetcode and codeputcode and  codecontainsKeycode.p  pstrongThe first part of my question [solved]strong what other calls cause the map to be touched Specifically, does anyone know if codesizecode falls into this categoryp  pThe reason for wondering this is that Ive implemented a scheduled task to occasionally nudge the Guava map Im using for caching, using this simple methodp  precodepublic static void nudgeEviction      cache.containsKey  codepre  pHowever Im also using codecache.sizecode to programmatically report the number of objects contained in the map, as a way to confirm this strategy is working. But I havent been able to see a difference from these reports, and now Im wondering if codesizecode also causes eviction to take place.p  pstrongAnswerstrong So Mark has pointed out that in release 9, eviction is invoked only by the codegetcode, codeputcode, and codereplacecode methods, which would explain why I wasnt seeing an effect for codecontainsKeycode. This will apparently change with the next version of guava which is set for release soon, but unfortunately my projects release is set sooner.p  pThis puts me in an interesting predicament. Normally I could still touch the map by calling codegetcode, but Im actually using a computing mapp  precodeConcurrentMapltString, MyObjectgt cache  new MapMaker         .expireAfterAccess10, TimeUnit.MINUTES         .makeComputingMaploadFunction codepre  pwhere codeloadFunctioncode loads the codeMyObjectcode corresponding to the key from a database. Its starting to look like I have no easy way of forcing eviction until r10. But even being able to reliably force eviction is put into doubt by the second part of my questionp  pstrongThe second part of my question [solved]strong In reaction a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5899383lazinessofevictioninguavasmaps61599966159996to one of the responses to the linked questiona, does touching the map reliably evict all expired entries In the linked answer, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers450027nirajtoliaNiraj Toliaa indicates otherwise, saying eviction is potentially only processed in batches, which would mean multiple calls to touch the map might be needed to ensure all expired objects were evicted. He did not elaborate, however this seems related to the map being split into segments based on concurrency level. Assuming I used r10, in which a codecontainsKeycode does invoke eviction, would this then be for the entire map, or only for one of the segmentsp  pstrongAnswerstrong maaartinus has addressed this part of the questionp  blockquote   pBeware that codecontainsKeycode and other reading methods only run codepostReadCleanupcode, which does nothing but on each 64th invocation see DRAINTHRESHOLD. Moreover, it looks like all cleanup methods work with single Segment only.p blockquote  pSo it looks like calling codecontainsKeycode wouldnt be a viable fix, even in r10. This reduces my question to the title emHow can I reliably force eviction to occuremp  pstrongNotestrong Part of the reason my web app is noticeably affected by this issue is that when I implemented caching I decided to use multiple maps  one for each class of my data objects. So with this issue there is the possibility that one area of code is executed, causing a bunch of codeFoocode objects to be cached, and then the codeFoocode cache isnt touched again for a long time so it doesnt evict anything. Meanwhile codeBarcode and codeBazcode objects are being cached from other areas of code, and memory is being eaten. Im setting a maximum size on these maps, but this is a flimsy safeguard at best Im assuming its effect is immediate  still need to confirm this.p  pstrongUPDATE 1strong Thanks to Darren for linking the relevant issues  they now have my votes. So it looks like a resolution is in the pipeline, but seems unlikely to be in r10. In the meantime, my question remains.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong At this point Im just waiting for a Guava team member to give feedback on the hack maaartinus and I put together see answers below.p  pstrongLAST UPDATEstrong feedback received p

Negative 33 pWe are currently attempting to port a very very large project built with ant to maven while also moving to svn.

We will visit the classifier   later, but for now it suffices to know that those kinds of projects   are displayed as groupIdartifactIdpackagingclassifierversion.p blockquote  pandp  blockquote   pThe classifier allows to distinguish artifacts that were built from   the same POM but differ in their content. It is some optional and   arbitrary string that  if present  is appended to the artifact name   just after the version number. As a motivation for this element,   consider for example a project that offers an artifact targeting JRE   1.5 but at the same time also an artifact that still supports JRE 1.4. The first artifact could be equipped with the classifier jdk15 and the   second one with jdk14 such that clients can choose which one to use.p      pAnother common use case for classifiers is the need to attach   secondary artifacts to the projects main artifact. If you browse the   Maven central repository, you will notice that the classifiers sources   and javadoc are used to deploy the project source code and API docs   along with the packaged class files.p blockquote
Negative 33 pI have an app where I am creating two subviews of the main window, the subviews are of a class called Page and on each subview I am placing another subview of a class called Ad. I am dragging the Ad classes between the Page subviews. Initially I was just resetting the Ad class views frame, but what I really want to do is place it where the NSLeftMouseUp event occurs. p  pMy process for doing this is to register all the Page subviews into an array as they are being created. I then made a subclass of NSWindow and assigned that class to my main window in IB. I pass the array of Page views to this class. p  pI think overwrite the sendEvent method, checking to see if the event is a NSLeftMouseDown, NSLeftMouseDragged or NSLeftMouseUp. The NSLeftMouseDown is to check and see if the subview clicked on is the deepest subview of the window hierarchy  windowPage classAd class, since I want to move ads and not pages. I loop through the array and then check the descendentOf method of the NSView Ad clicked to see if is a descendent of the NSView Page being enumerated. Hope that made sense. I then pull its frame as well. p  pIn NSLeftMouseDragged I change the cursor to resemble the ad being dragged. p  pIn NSLeftMouseUp I check to see what view we are looking to move the ad to.

Negative 33 pWe have been developing an ecommerce application for a year now and we started doing business in different countries. This means having to implement a number of very different payment systems inside a single application. For example we have different types of credit card processor gateways for each country, mobile payment gateways in some countries, pay pal, direct banking in each country and so on ... Each of these systems is designed in its own way with its own data model and sometimes its own workflow and we use different subgroups of these payment systems in different countries. There is a great need to make this plugable. However we have no experience with such architecture. Since we started by adding one by one as the need arose, we currently have no real architecture for this, as we have only one table in database and this single table contains all the fields for all the payment systems we support, which is becoming very error prone and chaotic.p  pWhat do you think is the best solution to create a truly plugable system for all of these different payment options each with its own data model but completely pluggablep

Negative 33 pIve been trying to find a good jquery auto grow plugin but every single one I find either doesnt work correctly in all browser, up to date ones, not so worried about older browsers, or they dont allow me to put my own css heightwidth etc. to them. I just want a simple one that works, I dont want any fancy animations, unless that plugin works great, one I have had worked perfect in firefox, however in webkit it would autogrow when you typed, even before the text got to the end of the line, and then another autogrow one wouldnt allow me to set the heightwidth to specific values. p
Negative 33 pI have a very fast loop which renders animation in a Bitmap buffer and adds filter to it by using LockBitsUnlockBits to access to the raw data and Marshaling changes to it. in an independent thread. p  pI wanted to figure out a way to display the render on the Form, realtime, so I created a PictureBox and linked its Image to the bitmap I created. Everytime immediately after the bitmap is unlocked, I refreshed the PictureBox using delegate, to do crossthreading so that the rendering is updated properly.p  pIts totally fine and works very fast, but one big problem came out as I tried dragging the form to the border of the screen, to see if any bug would appear, and oops, the app collapse..saying the bitmap is being locked This happens when either theres other window moving above the PictureBox or the PictureBox is dragged partially out of the screen. I suspice it because PictureBox can refresh itself when redraw is neccessary, and it does when the bitmap is still being locked. So...any way to sovle this problem Or anyother ways to render the my animation betterp

Negative 33 pFor my application, I have the requirement to develop the same functionality in a ASP.NET Web Forms application and a WPF disconnected application. I need to choose a presentation pattern that will accommodate both technologies smoothly. I was leaning toward MVP, using the MVC framework but it seems that all of the MVP frameworks are not really supported any more or need to be extended to support WPF. On the other side of the coin, MVVM seems to be the hot presentation pattern at the moment but wikipedia mentions that there are drawbacks to MVVM when it comes to larger applications.p  pI need some guidance on choosing a pattern and an implementation framework that will not be deprecated in just a few short years. Is MVP dead for the .NET stack Is MVVM the better choice Is there an MVVM framework for ASP.NET Web Formsp  pAny suggestions would be greately appreciatedp
Negative 33 pI created a new project, then I clicked on Import to Subversion repository but I had problems with the initial set up so I decided to start again. p  pFor that, I browsed my local repository with SVN, deleted the repository that was created with the command above from Netbeans and now that repository is totally gone. p  pWell, I then deleted my project in Netbeans and created a new one with the same folders namestructure. I was expecting to have that Import to Subversion repository option enabled as this was a new fresh project but somehow Netbeans remembers things from the 1st attempt and doesnt have that option enabled, it displays all the options, as in the repository existed in SVN. p  pIf I right click and choose Diff or Show Changes, then I can see the Netbeans displays the original folders in the Repository Location section, but where is that information coming from as I deleted that folder from the SVN repository with Tortoise p  pAnd how can I delete all the information Netbeans has and start again I was looking for a .svn folder in my project but theres nothing As said, I deleted the whole project and started again but Netbeans still remembers things, that are not correct p  pMany thanks for any tip...p

Negative 33 pI am building system to analyze large quantities of financial data regarding securities trading prices. A large challenge in this is determining what storage method to use for the data given that the data will be in the 10s of terrabytes. There will be many queries on the data such as taking averages, calculating standard deviations, and sums filtered by multiple columns such as price, time, volume, etc. Join statements arent a requisite, but would be nice to have.p  pRight now, I am looking at infobright community edition, monetdb, and greenplum community edition for evaluation purposes. They seem great so far, but for more advanced features, some of each are required are not available in some of these editions using multiple servers, insertupdate statements, etc.p  pWhat solutions would you use for this situation, and benefits does it provide over the alternatives Being cost effective is a major plus. If I must pay for a data warehousing solution I will, but I would much rather avoid it and take the opensourcecommunity edition route if possible.p

Negative 33 pI would like to compare two eyetracking scanpaths. The eyetracking results in a sequence of labels that the observer look at, for a division of an image into labeled tiles rectangular regions. We also know from the eyetracking at what time, and for how long the eye look at tile N.p  pThe Levenshtein or string edit distance works fine, as long as the timing of the fixations are not taken into account. For example, f user 1 looks at the tiles AKPLA, and user 2 looks at tiles ATPLB the string edit distance will be 2, but user 2 might look at P in a much longer time than user 2.  p  pAny ideas of how to improve the  distance measure to measure timing differences as well note that the algorithm is not restricted to character strings, it works equally well with arrays of integers.p

Negative 33 pstrongHello allstrongp  pThis is my first post on stackoverflow. After hours of searching and trialing, StackOverflow coming up on alot of possible fixes I decided it was time to ask the question myself.

Also note I do not expect direct plugin support but I will cite the plugins being used, that it could help potentially.p  pstrongPrefacestrongp  ol liI am using a plugin called NextGen Gallery, this plugin powers my portfolio. All my clients have their own gallery which I display on the portfolio site. li liI have also installed a plugin called Fancybox for Wordpress. This plugin allows for a good looking lightbox display of all my clients.li liI have a third plugin called Custom Fields for NextGen Gallery, this plugin allows me to add custom fields specific to each gallery and image within. You will see I have already utilized this by creating custom thumbnails through a link added through the Custom Fields plugin.li ol  pAll that being said my goal was to, utilizing the custom fields plugin, add html rich description text and html rich Client title text specific to each slide. The top of the slide reads the Client name and under the slide reads a description with links.

Negative 33 pIm trying to interface a large Scala  Akka  PlayMini application with an external REST API. The idea is to periodically poll basically every 1 to 10 minutes a root URL and then crawl through sublevel URLs to extract data which is then sent to a message queue.p  pI have come up with two ways to do thisp  h21st wayh2  pCreate a hierarchy of actors to match the resource path structure of the API. In the Google Latitude case, that would mean, e.g.p  ul liActor latitudev1currentLocation polls a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1currentLocation relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1currentLocationali liActor latitudev1location polls a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1locationali liActor latitudev1location1 polls a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location1 relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location1ali liActor latitudev1location2 polls a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location2 relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location2ali liActor latitudev1location3 polls a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location3 relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location3ali lietc.li ul  pIn this case, each actor is responsible for polling its associated resource periodically, as well as creating  deleting child actors for nextlevel path resources i.e. actor latitudev1location creates actors 1, 2, 3, etc. for all locations it learns about through polling of a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1locationa.p  h22nd wayh2  pCreate a pool of identical polling actors which receive polling requests containing the resource path loadbalanced by a router, poll the URL once, do some processing, and schedule polling requests both for nextlevel resources and for the polled URL. In Google Latitude, that would mean for instancep  p1 router, n poller actors. Initial polling request for a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1locationa leads to several new immediate polling requests for a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location1 relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location1a, a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location2 relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location2a, etc. and one delayed polling request for the same resource, i.e. a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1locationa.p  pI have implemented both solutions and cant immediately observe any relevant difference of performance, at least not for the API and polling frequencies I am interested in. I find the first approach to be somewhat easier to reason about and perhaps easier to use with system.scheduler.schedule... than the second approach where I need to scheduleOnce.... Also, assuming resources are nested through several levels and somewhat shortlived e.g. several resources may be addedremoved between each polling, akkas lifecycle management makes it easy to kill off a whole branch in the 1st case. The second approach should theoretically be faster and the code is somewhat easier to write.p  pMy questions are p  ol liWhat approach seems to be the best in terms of performance, extensibility, code complexity, etc.li liDo you see anything wrong with the design of either approach esp. the 1st oneli liHas anyone tried to implement anything similar How was it doneli ol  pThanksp

Negative 33 pIm trying to design a page which works on many different types of display sizes. Right now I have an important piece of content a small rectangle showing current status, essentially which is absolutely positioned inside a relatively positioned container.  This gives the desired behavior when the page is loaded in a device with a large screen the content appears above the fold no scrolling needed at the intended position.p  pFor devices with small screens or, I suppose, browsers which arent maximized such that the box would appear off the first screen, I want the box to be shown at the bottom of the page until the user scrolls down far enough to return the box to its normal position, at which point it should resume that place.  Yes, it should scroll off the top of the page if the user scrolls far enough down.p  pIve seen this dynamic effect before, so its definitely possible. Something not entirely dissimilar is used at a hrefhttpgoogleblog.blogspot.com relnofollowhttpgoogleblog.blogspot.coma. But how is it done I dont think Javascript was used, though I could be wrong.p  pObviously, a media query would not get the desired behavior, since that could give it a fixed position but not one which transitions in the desired fashion.p

Negative 33 pI have a server that receives GPS data from a mobile device iphone and then finds the distinct cities from which the data comes strongfor each distinct daystrong. The app syncs every three hours. Since the granularity I need is not that small Im not interested in anything smaller than cities Id like to be able to say this person was in this or that city during this or that date. The problem is, GPS warmup, bad accuracy and the sheer amount of data received the device collects data every ten minutes and syncs with the server every 3 hours sometimes yield false positives or bad data I have a user that lives near the border of nycnj and I keep getting alternate locations from one or the other place, even though he spends most of his actual day far from the border, so those times when hes home shouldnt matter.p  pMy question is what algorithms should I consider, what papers should I read, or, even, what terms should I google to find an approach that will help me get rid of the noise and false positives for data thats being synced every n hours and that neednt be more granular than a certain level city, in this case and which is significant for a certain period of time think about it as the fact that Im counting the visits to distinct cities, states or countries for distinct dates. I was thinking of something like clustering or dissolving the data, but I dont know anything about geo algorithms, yet p

Ive tested in FF14, Chrome 21, Safari 5 Windows and Safari Mac and Webkit browsers on Android and iPhone. p  pMy application runs on the trigger.io a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comVCHoa.pngforgea platform and uses a proxy to route requests from the web application to the service. The proxy simply forwards the requests and cookies along and this works as expected in most of the browsers.  p  pAfter inspecting the request in dragonfly, I noticed that the server sends the proper headers in the response, but Opera seems to be ignoring setting the values.

On first load, the page has no PostBack, so it will bind the data to the dropdown cmbAfdeling.p  pThen, when submitting the form, there IS a postback, so we dont reach the code inside the if statement. To me, that would mean that ASP.NET would NOT bind the data to the combo box.p  pHowever, the data is still there after submitting and thus having a postback.p  pHow is this explainedp  pThanksp
Negative 33 pJSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netM2ALY3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netM2ALY3ap  pMy goal is to make a module that I can use and distribute. Therefore I must not pollute the global namespace. The module Im making is also going to be used multiple times on one web page. Thats why I chose to use OOP, but this introduced a problem.p  pI want my object to bind a function to be run when the user clicks an element in the DOM. In this simplified example I made, I want an alert box to pop up when the user clicks a paragraph. As an example, one of the things I need in the real project Im working on is The user clicks a canvas, the function figures out where the user clicked and saves it to this.clientX and this.clientY.p  pInstead of doingp  precodethis.bind  function      p1.bindclick, function           code here       codepre  pI figured it would work if I didp  precodethis.bind  function obj.codeMovedToThisMethod codepre  pThe problem is that this isnt a good design. Inside the class you shouldnt need to know the name of the objects that is going to be made of this class. This doesnt get better when Im making multiple objects of the class...p  pSo I figured I could do p  precodep1.bindclick, functionthis           code here       codepre  pBut it didnt work because sending this into the function didnt work as I thought.p  pHow should I solve this problem Here is a simplified sample problem. Same as JSFiddle.p  precodevar test  function      this.alert  function          alertHi           this.bind  function          p1.bindclick, function              obj.alert                         window.obj  new test obj.bind   What if I want to do this  var test2  function       Private vars     this.variable  This secret is hidden.      this.alert  function          alertthis.variable           this.bind  function          p2.bindclick, functionthis              obj2.alert             this.alert                         window.obj2  new test2 obj2.bind codepre  pThanksp

Negative 33 pIm trying to use a .NET COMdll which is part of the SDK for a stepper motor control interface. The SDK provides a type library, which I imported into Delphi via Import Component  Import a Type Library.p  pAlthough I know some basics about COM programming, I struggle to get the interface working.

Negative 33 pI have a repository with an open source iOS framework. Theres two branches at the moment codemastercode and codedevelopcode.p  pcodemastercode contains the current version of my framework, which is now obsolete. codedevelopcode contains the new version, which is ready for release. p  pNow, I want to make the new version on codedevelopcode the official version so I want to move it to codemastercode. Normally, Id use a simple merge from codedevelopcode to codemastercode. However, there are quite a bit API changes between codedevelopcode and codemastercode so I get quite a bit of merge conflicts. p  pBefore I dive into these conflicts, Id like to know if theres a better way to just switch codemastercode and codedevelopcode.

Negative 33 pIs there any way to recognize by process codehttpcode packet or filtering codetcpcode connections does several requests belong to one opening url or another p  pTry to explain in more detail.  When we open any page in browser it also initializes different requests to download images, resources, scripts. I d like to get know that some scope of requests was invoked by opening site call it main site.  I can get codereferercode property but in that case how to distinguish request to resorce from  request to different site link on which was clicked on main site. In both cases codereferercode will be the same. I suspect that this problem could not be resolved, but I hope that Im mistaken. Or you can offer some workaround.p

Negative 33 pI have some question regarding SQL Server Database.p  pI have a old database in working state in which the actual data of Employee exists. I am creating a new database for my application. For this new application I need to depend on data from old database. I am only storing the Employee Id in my new database and fetching the names and other details for display as and when required. I am using join between two databases to fetch employee details Example p  precodeJOIN [ASES].[dbo].[USERS] AS USERS     ON CRMDR.Requester COLLATE SQLLatin1GeneralCP1CIAS  USERS.RID COLLATE SQLLatin1GeneralCP1CIAS codepre  pI am trying to find out the performance difference. This join from two difference database is better or if I copy the Employee details in my new database and then my query will have only single database join Which one is  more better as per performancep
Negative 33 pOn ipad  iphone, the overlay appears over the top of media in fancybox, that is the whole page is filled with the overlay incuding the content of fancybox.

Negative 33 pNow, I know it is generally bad to add new virtual functions to nonleaf classes as it breaks binary compatibility for any derived classes which havent been recompiled.

Negative 33 pSometimes I need to make multiple copies of code with incrementing numbers. In a form Im coding, I need to make upwards of 12 checkboxes, each of which requires the following codep  precode    self.checkBox1  QtGui.QCheckBox     self.checkBox1.setGeometryQtCore.QRect20, 20, 70, 17     self.checkBox1.setObjectNamefromUtf8checkBox1 codepre  pThe script below enables me to avoid the boring task of manually changing the numbers for each checkbox. I just copy the 3 lines above into the windows clipboard, and then... I insert checkBox into the first field in the form, 1 into the second field, and 12 into the third field. When I hit the ok button, the 12 sequentially numbered copies of the 3 lines appear in the 4th field in the form. I hope this provides some help to other people.

Negative 33 pIm trying to implement a Remember Me feature in the new Padrino 0.11 Admin interface, but having a little bit of trouble due to the differences between it and Rails. Basically, Im following along with a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes274remembermeresetpassword relnofollowhttprailscasts.comepisodes274remembermeresetpassworda.p  pIve managed to get the Remember Me and authtoken working handily, and I can see the cookie in the Dev console when I go to look at it. I am having a lot of trouble figuring out how to get the application to do autologin emonem the cookie when it is present though. Im sure its something stupid, but this is where Im up to.p  pFor instance, Ive got the actual Remember Me creating an authtoken and setting it fine to the cookie I can see it on localhost in the dev console on Chrome via this in the sessions controller.p  pemadmincontrollerssessionsemp  precodepost create do   if account  Account.authenticateparams[email], params[password]     setcurrentaccountaccount     if params[rememberme]       response.setcookiedaapp, value account.authtoken,                               expires Time.now  1.year  1.day     end     flash[success]  Youve successfully logged in as account.name.     redirect urlbase, index   else     params[email], params[password]  hparams[email], hparams[password]     flash[error]  patlogin.error     redirect urlsessions, new   end end codepre  pHowever, due to my inexperience with padrino, a little stumped as to where Id put the bit of logic which triggers before an incoming request, checks for the cookie and then logs the user in. I tried the following, which is not perfect but which is definitely not working though not sure why... lt  and in fact, the code block to detect the cookie does not even seem to be firing which seems pretty basic..p  pemadminapp.rb not sure this is the right place for it actuallyemp  precodebefore  do   if request.cookies[daapp].exists     setcurrentaccountAccount.findbyauthtokenrequest.cookies[daapp]     redirect urlbase, index   end end codepre  pSo, Im sure its probably dead simple to solve but a bit stumped on this one and also, am really trying to avoid using a gem plugin like padrinowarden or the like at the moment and implement this from scratch as an exercise..p  pemAlso, bonus karma points on helping solve this one as Im implementing this as part of some pro bono work for a global conservation charity.emp

Negative 33 pI have to create a MySQL InnoDB table using a strictly sequential ID to each element in the table row. There cannot be any gap in the IDs  each element has to have a different ID and they HAVE TO be sequentially assigned. Concurrent users create data on this table.p  pI have experienced MySQL autoincrement behaviour where if a transaction fails, the PK number is not used, leaving a gap.

I cant afford having users writing on the table and waiting long times.li liI might need to shard the table... but still keeping the ID count.li liThe sequence of the elements in the table is NOT important, but the IDs have to be sequential ie, if an element is created before another does not need to have a lower ID, but gaps between IDs are not allowed.li ul  pThe only solution I can think of is to use an additional COUNTER table to keep the count. Then create the element in the table with an empty ID not PK and then lock the COUNTER table, get the number, write it on the element, increase the number, unlock the table. I think this will work fine but has an obvious bottle neck during the time of locking nobody is able to write any ID. Also, is a single point of failure if the node holding the table is not available. I could create a mastermaster replication but I am not sure if this way I take the risk of using an outofdate ID counter I have never used replication.p  pThanks.p

Ideally, it would be great to have the button 1 with text centered vertically i.e. as appears normally in a button and 2 with the progress bar below the text. The button would be 2 times default height to allow space for the progressbar. I can tweak position and spacing of anything you come up with. I am very interested in getting the bindings done correctly to update the progressbar.p  pThanks Buckp

Negative 33 pI want to create a weekly MySQL dump from my production environment intended for our developers. We have a SQLscript which deletes unnecessary production data and anonymouses user information.p  pIs there any way to run this script, which contains INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE TABLE, without loading the entire database into a secondary MySQL database and without running it on the production database which I obviously do not wantp
Negative 33 pOk, this is hard to search for and see if there is anyone else that might have run into this problem.p  pI am using the GZipStream to Compress XML files in my application which was developed using VS 2010 and the .NET 4.0 Framework.  I use this feature to export data from my production databases and then upload them to my clients server, where I then Decompress the file, load the XML and write the data to the database.  This has worked without a problem.p  pNow, comes the fun part.  I have now upgraded my Development to VS 2012 and .NET 4.5 Framework.  The Compress and Decompress works fine.  So, in my production environment I export work to an XML file, which I then compress.  I take that file and upload to my clients still running .NET 4.0 and it will not Decompress the file.  It doesnt create an error, it just creates a new file with the exact contents of the compressed file.  Of course it isnt XML so it crashes.p  pHas anyone had this issue  Any workarounds in .NET 4.5  Looks like Microsoft changed the way it compresses using that same code in 4.5  Is there a way to make it workp

Negative 33 pSo I have a 2D array of 1 and 0 values, a value is either on or off, this can generate shapes and I want to check for vertical lines, for examplep  precode[0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] codepre  pthat has a vertical line in column 5 so we will return those ones and strip all other results change the 1s that arent part of that line to 0s...p  precode[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] codepre  pMy 2 dimensional array is much more complex, it is about a 300x600 2D array. Inorder to visually see the values I generated UIViews with red background and stuck them on the screen in a view the size of my array. This is what the returned image was the blue arrow was later photoshopped in to indicate the longest vertical line the values we want to keepp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commtixT.png altenter image description herep  pSo whats a good method to find the longest vertical line of 1 values in a 2 dimensional array and change all other values to zero. So that if I render the array in a visual graph format again only this is displayed other red dots are fading out because they have been changed from 1 values to 0 values.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUvXhn.jpg altenter image description herep  pI was thinking maybe something along the lines of generating a forloop that would keep track of all of the 1 values in each column and a set of maybe any given 6 columns that are consecutively next to each other that have the largest amount of 1 values is the area 6 columns wide where the longest vertical line is most likely located, but I can see a few issues with this, also I dont know how to get the rows that are part of that line after I have the columns.... hmmmmp  pbrbrhrbrbrNote I am making my 2 dimensional array by just have a variable for the fixed number of columns and then I have an array that just has all of the values for all columnrow combinations. For example a 3x3 board would be code[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]code which I can then understand means thisp  precode[0,0,0] [0,1,0] [0,0,0] codepre  pBecause I know there is always 3 columns per row. br code[row1column1,row1column2,row1column3,row2column1,row2column2,row2column3,row3column1,row3column2,row3column3]codep

Negative 33 pIm trying to set up a Git repo for a personal project Im working on that will use the Opencart software as a foundation.  The Opencart project is hosted on Github at github.comOpencartOpencart, so obviously its using Git as its version control tool.p  pId like to have the Opencart project as a remote repo upstream and keep the Master branch of the Upstream Repo in my local repo to merge future commits into my working copy.  The main problem Im coming across is that the OpencartOpencart Repo is set up so all the source files are kept in a directory called upload, but Id like to keep all the files in the repo directory so I can deploy my repo to my web servers root publichtml directory.  If I set up my Repo to have all the files in the repo root, when I try to merge in commits from the upstream repo it basically duplicates ALL the files except in a directory inside the repo called upload.p  pIs there a way to set upconfigure my repo so that all my files can be in the repo root directory and have the upstreammaster branch keep the files in the upload directory but have git consider the two directories the same That way I can then merge commits from the upstream master into my Repo for future changesfixesimprovements without Git thinking the there are two sets of filesp

So I did this by defining an event in the base class, that is called after File.ReadAllLines, and all derived classes attach their mapping logic to the inherited event. p  pBut I understand this solution is not correct designwise. First of all, there is no meaning in instantiating the base class, so it should be abstract. The reason I did not make it abstract is that the construction code for all the derived objects is the same, so I defined it as the base constructor. Should I declare an Initialize method in the abstract class and simply call it in every derived classs constructor looks weird... Perhaps interfaces I dont see how using an interface would give me any benefits here, besides it will not solve this constructor problem...p  pWhat is the correct solutionp  pCode demonstration of my scenariop  precodepublic delegate void myDelegateobject parameter  class Base     region Attributes    ...    endregion     public Baseobject p          initialization code      ...         region Methods    protected void m1      protected void m2      ...    endregion     public event myDelegate myEvent   class Child1      public Child1object o  baseo            this.myEvent  new myDelegateChildMethod           public void ChildMethodobject o            ...       codepre

Negative 33 pWere about to begin work on a new web application. Were almost 100 that development will be done in Typescript rather than Javascript. p  pIve begun to look at frameworks  code structures that make sense for the application. Obviously most of these frameworks are written in Javascript. My worry is that these frameworks have been designed with the limitations of Javascript in mind, not strongly typed modular Typescript e.g. Backbones events are string names.p  pAre these frameworks still worth using for the structure  utility they bring Are we going to end up fighting to make a Javascript framework work the Typescript wayp

The problem is I want the UDP packets to continue to stream even while the bluetooth device is trying to connect but I cant find why the packets arent being received while the device is trying to connect.p  pThese are the permissions I have setp  precodeltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.BLUETOOTHADMIN gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.BLUETOOTH gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.INTERNETgtltusespermissiongt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSNETWORKSTATEgtltusespermissiongt codepre  pBluetooth device connectionp  precode    public void run          synchronized BluetoothSocketService.this              if mState  HeadsetConnectionState.CONNECTED                  Log.iTAG, BEGIN mConnectThread                  BluetoothSocket tmp  null                 try                      tmp  mmDevice                             .createRfcommSocketToServiceRecordMYUUID                  catch IOException e                      Log.eTAG, create failed, e                                  mmSocket  tmp                 mAdapter.cancelDiscovery                  try                      mmSocket.connect                  catch IOException e                      try                          mmSocket.close                      catch IOException e2                          Log.eTAG,                                 unable to close socket during connection failure,                                 e2                                          Log.dTAG, bluetooth failed to connect                     if connectTimer  null                         connectTimer.schedule                                 new ConnectTimerTaskmmDevice,                                 DELAYBEFORERECONNECTATTEMPTMS,                                 TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS                     return                                  connectedmmSocket, mmDevice                            codepre  pUDP packet receivingp  precodepublic void run      if myDatagramSocket  null          if isRunning              Logger.printProcessUdpServer.run,                     UdpServer is running    myPort               else          Logger.printErrorUdpServer.run,                 Socket is null. closing UdpServer.         return           while isRunning          try              byte[] myBuffer  new byte[myDatagramSize]             DatagramPacket myPacket  new DatagramPacketmyBuffer,                     myDatagramSize             System.out.printlnReceiving datagram packet             myDatagramSocket.receivemyPacket             myListener.processmyPacket, myPort          catch IOException ioex              Logger.printProcessUdpServer.run,  socket closed.             break          catch ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException ex              Logger.printErrorUdpServer.run,                     ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException    ex                   dispose  codepre

Negative 33 pI have a very long natural key hundreds of characters in a chemical application. I can use MD5 against the value to create an ersatz natural key. What Id like to know is whether the following is possible consider two sets of child rowsp  precode       ParentTable        parent1        parent2         ChildTable        parent1....md5 value a        parent1....md5 value b        parent1....md5 value c         parent2....md5 value b        parent2....md5 value c        parent2....md5 value a codepre  pIs it possible to compute each threerow set of md5 values and compare the computed values against each other in order to determine whether parent1 and parent2 have the same set of children  The children are not in the same order but there is really no order in any case  those three tuples are really just a bag of rows.p  pSo the question could be, do parent1 and parent2 have the same things in their respective bagsp  pAnd again, to be clear, I am hoping to avoid having to compare one set against the other, row by row.  Ideally Id like to find something analogous to codeselect summd5 from ChildTable where parent1code.p  pEDIT there would be a unique index on the child table to prevent the same value from occurring more than once for the same parent codecreate unique index UXCHILDTABLE on ChildTableparent, md5codep  pEDIT2 sameness or equality when bag is compared to bag would be defined  as  they contain the same set of MD5 values, i.e. emeveryem item in one bag has its twin in the other bag.  All of bag1s entities are found in bag2 and all of bag2s entities are found in bag1.p

So far, I identified the following general groups of features User role modeling and personas support, User stories and epics management, Acceptance testing support, Highlevel release planning, Lowlevel iteration planning, and Progress tracking. Each group contains some specific features, e.g., support for story points, writing of acceptance tests, etc.p  pWhich features of user story management should an agile team look for especially when switching from tangible tools index cards, pin boards and big visible charts to a software tool Are some features more important than the others Many thanks in advancep

Negative 33 pI have a Delphi program D2010 that accesses a local SQL Server 2005 Express database using the ADO components TADOConnection and TADOQuery. At program startup I use a correlated subquery to identify the maximum of a specific field for a range of values. This works well in all our testing.p  pHowever, on some customer systems we have seen that if our program is shutdown and restarted immediately, the program fails when running this subquery with an EOleException The requested properties cannot be supported. Subsequent restarts of the program repeat this error, until the PC is rebooted. In this state, all other database access in the program seems OK this is the only use of a correlated subquery in the program.p  pThe correlated subquery isp  precodeSELECT p1. FROM Packs p1 WHERE p1.MachID  MachID AND p1.BuildID lt MaxPosID AND p1.PackID    SELECT MAXp2.PackID FROM packs p2 WHERE p2.BuildID  p1.BuildID and p2.MachID  p1.MachID  ORDER BY BuildID codepre  pThe MachID and MaxPosID fields do not change on an individual system, so the query is the same in any run of the program. The only difference with the customer systems is that they may be running with larger databases typ. 1GB.p  pI have added some code to iterate over the database connection properties, and seen that on our working systems the Subquery Support property has a value of 31H, which according tobr a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryofficeaa14002228voffice.1029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryofficeaa140022voffice.10.aspxa means that correlated subqueries are supported. p  pI assume that when the problem occurs on customer sites the property does not have the same value set for some reason. p  pOne workaround was to open a command prompt, and use sqlcmd to just USE our database name. If this command prompt is left open, then our program starts normally. I have no idea how this would affect the running of our program, or the value of the properties returned by the connection object.p  pAny ideas about why the supported properties change, or why program shutdownstartup should see this changep  pI can rewrite the code to replace the use of the correlated subquery with a slower search through the table until I find all the required values, and this would probably not be affected by the problem, but I would like to understand what is happening.p  pEdit the connection string isp  precodeProviderSQLNCLI.1Integrated SecuritySSPIPersist Security InfoFalseInitial CatalogTQSquality codepre  pThe connection string is modified at runtime to add OLE DB Services  2, to switch off connection pooling. p  pThe query is executed byp  precodeSetCnxLastPackIDQry, CnxQuality LastPackIDQry.Parameters[0].Value  GetMachNo LastPackIDQry.Parameters[1].Value  TQS.PosRange.Last QryOpenLastPackIDQry try   while not Eof do   begin codepre  p...process the datap  pQryOpen is a utility that just calls .Open on the input query, but provides some logging on errors.

Negative 33 pI would like to return a matrixdata.frame each row containing arguments and the content of a file.p  pHowever, there may be many files, so I would prefer if I could load the file lazily, so the file is only read if the actual content is requested.

Negative 33 pI have a form in MS Access that allows users to enter data they collect from the field and that form also has the option to compile all of the information into a formal report. The report contains a cover sheet and a table of contents as well as leaves section header pages for additional documents to be attached when printed outexported. p  pThere are 2 things that execute before their processes are actually finishedp  ul lipOne subroutine creates many formatted tables but the tables only get created with the appropriate data, the formatting does not apply right away and as a result, the formatting finally kicks in once the document is done typing and will delete any extra pages. This is affecting the second problem. pli lipSince the page numbering for each page is not the same, sections are used so that each page can have a unique footer with the page number included in that. A loop is used to run through the document and unlink all headers and footers from the previous ones. It then starts from the beginning of the document and moves from footer to footer and writes the page number. That code is belowp  precodeWhile Not Selection.InformationwdActiveEndPageNumber  If Selection.InformationwdActiveEndPageNumber  SectionPage  1 Then   Selection.TypeText Page  amp pgNum  SectionLength   pgNum  pgNum  SectionLength  Else   Selection.TypeText Page  amp pgNum  End If  pgNum  pgNum  1  ActiveWindow.ActivePane.View.NextHeaderFooter move to the next pages footer Wend codepreli ul  pThe problem that I am having with this section of code is that the Selection does not always move to the next footer fast enough and as a result footers that belong on the next page sometimes cram onto the same page as another footer and the footer looks something like Page 5Page 6 rather than Page 5 on one and Page 6 on the next.p  pPlease do not suggest the built in Word page numbering  I shortened the code here, there are anywhere between 3 and 7 sections that need spacing. I think if there was a way to get the code to execute asynchronously that block of code will work.p

Negative 33 pWhat is the advantage of passing in a strategy to execute as a method argument as opposed to having the implementation in an explicit method  For example, consider this calculator classp  pEdited to include IOperation interfacep  precodepublic class Calculator      public double DoOperationIOperation operation, double num1, double num2              return operation.Executenum1, num2        public interface IOperation      double Executedouble num1, double num2   public class AddOperation  IOperation      public override double Executedouble num1, double num2              return num1  num2         Leaving out implementations for SubtractOperation, DivideOperation, and MultiplyOperation codepre  pAs opposed top  precodepublic class Calculator      public double Adddouble num1, double num2              return num1  num2           public double Subtractdouble num1, double num2              return num1  num2           public double Multiplydouble num1, double num2              return num1  num2           public double Dividedouble num1, double num2              return num1  num2          codepre  pWith the strategy pattern, if you need to add an operation, you must create and test a new class.  In the second example, you must create and test a new method.  Seems like the same difference to me.  In fact, I prefer the explicit method name version better because I think its easier to understand.p  pThere is only one advantage I can think of for the strategy pattern.  That is, if you are developing a framework for other people to use, and you really cant determine what strategy other people might implement.p  pIn all other cases, there are always a finite number of strategies that can be implemented.  So, what advantage does the strategy pattern have over the explicit method name patternp  h2Edith2  pThanks to Markus, there is another advantage that I can think of to the above pattern.  In the first example, if the DoOperation method performed a more complex algorithm, and only used the strategy to factor out the differing code, then this would be an example of DRY.  And if the differing code is factored out into strategies, then there is a clear benefit to being able to test the strategies and the common part in isolation.p

Negative 33 pI was able to partly successfully read in a file in MIPs. Below is my current code. In QtSpim, when I run it, I get a pointer to the file in a1, but the last few characters of the file are repeated twice. The number of characters that is repeated changes depending on the file. From what Ive seen, it seems to be linked to the number of newline characters in the file unless the newline chars are at the very end of the file meaning, if there were 5 newline characters, the last 5 characters of the file would appear duplicated at the end of the file read in, although I dont see any reason why this should be true.

The problem is that Im having difficulty binding the lookups.columns object with my ngrepeat directive in my table.  Ive tried to reference the object using columns, lookups.columns, and permits.lookups.columns, yet I cannot seem to access it.p  pI tried to do something similar in my main controller, and after researching, I found that if I created a variable and assigned this to it, then referenced that variable when creating my object, it worked  my assumption is that the assignment of this effectively allows the function to assign objects in a scope outside of its own scope.  I tried to do that here by creating lookups, but that doesnt seem to be helping here.  I can see that lookups.columns is indeed created, but it is not in the scope of the controller.  Im just learning AngularJS please be gentle and still trying to wrap my head around all the binding and scope limitations.  Im guessing that my answer is to build a servicefactory and inject it, but when I try to do that based on all of the examples Ive seen, it breaks the parts that I have working, so I come back to this starting point, where at least everything else works.p

The results are sorted by table1.cola, as if codeORDER BYcode were not present.

Negative 33 pAt the moment Im working with ASP.NET MVC 5 and the new Identity 2 framework for authentication and authorization. Based on these principals I implemented a custom claimbased system which is able to check if a user action is permitted by passing an area and an action e.g area is reservation and the action is create.p  pNow I have the requirement to extend the system for using it in a multitenant application which differentiate the tenants by a url sub path. e.g. codehttpswww.mydomain.comtenant1controlleractioncode.p  pThe Identity framework is imho not able to set cookies based on a specific url sub path. On every place I tried to hook in and set the cookie path failed.p  pThe second use case I have, is granting a user temporary for a set of actions without the need to logout afterwards. This should also work if cookies are disabled.p  pI decided to rewrite the authentication system from scratch to fulfill my needs. Whats the best way to implement a cookie less temporary login. Story User wants to place a reservation. Therefore he must be authenticated to navigate through a wizard 2 or 3 async server requests. After finishing the wizard the user must be logged out without any interaction. Created tokens must be invalidated used for a kiosk mode.p  pWhat kind of principles and best practices exists for this scenario And experience with a similar use casep

Negative 33 pI wrote a program in Java and made a test for it, which tests the program a few billion times with different test data. The program itself only does calculation and is working with strings I cant provide the source code, sorry. To speed things up, it uses a thread pool with 15 threads on a 8 Core CPU with 16 threads, where it takes up to 12 hours to finish.p  pThe problem is, the performance of the whole test differs from start to start. After a little warmup, I normally get 3 millions tests per second, but sometimes only 2 million tests per second. This performance difference stays for the whole test time 812 hours, so it has nothing to do with the JIT. If I cancel a slow test and run it again with the exact same command line, there is a good chance it is faster the second try. So far I noticed a difference of up to 50 from start to start.p  pAm I doing something completely wrong or what could be the causep

Negative 33 pIm trying to build an app in Rails which will take audio file uploads and read metadata off them to populate a database. Im using the Taglibruby gem to handle various file types. The uploads seem to be working on their own, but Taglib considers any file given to it as null. p  pHeres my controller p  precodeclass UploadsController lt ApplicationController     require taglib      def new     end      def create         file  params[upload]         TagLibFileRef.openfile do fileref             unless fileref.null                 tag  fileref.tag                  properties  fileref.audioproperties                 song  Song.newtitle tag.title, artist tag.artist, album tag.album,                     year tag.year, track tag.track, genre tag.genre                 if song.save                     redirectto songspath                 else                     render new                 end             else                 raise file was null             end         end     end end codepre  pand my view for form submissionp  precodelth1gt Upload lth1gt  lt formtagurl  action create , html  multipart true  do gt      lt labeltag upload, Scan your song gt     lt filefieldtag upload, multiple true gt      ltbr gt     lt submittag Submit gt  lt end gt codepre  pTaglib itself seems to be working  adding require taglib removed the error I had been getting in regards to that, and a mockup I made of this outside of rails worked fine so the files Im using are also not the problem. Every time I run this, the control flow hits my raise command, and no record is saved. Its clear that fileref.null is returning true, which suggests to me that theres something wrong with the upload process... but Im not sure what.p  pIdeally, Id like to use the multiple uploads option and run this process on each file sequentially, but I cant even get a single upload to register as anything but null. p

Negative 33 pI am able to add shapefiles with less than 1000 points by using the ArcGIS Portal REST API as shown in this example a hrefhttpsdevelopers.arcgis.comjavascriptjssamplesportaladdshapefile.html relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.arcgis.comjavascriptjssamplesportaladdshapefile.htmlap  pHowever, there is a 1000 point maxRecordCount through their service. I have tried setting the maxRecordCount in the publishParameters without any luck. I also thought it may be possible to publish our own service with a raised maxRecordCount, but I am not very experienced in publishing custom scripts and did not know whether there was a toolbox that already provided this functionality.p  pSo my question is, is there a way to use the ArcGIS Portal REST API to return more than 1000 records If not, what would be the best approach to solve this problemp  pThank youp

Negative 33 pI want to create a proxy server which routes incoming packets from codeREQcode type sockets to one of the codeREPcode sockets on one of the computers in a cluster. I have been reading the guide and I think the proper structure is a combination of codeROUTERcode and codeDEALERcode on the proxy server. Where the codeROUTERcode passes messages to the dealer to be distributed. However, I cannot figure out how to create this connection scheme. Is this the correct architecture If so how to I bind a dealer to multiple addresses. The flow I envision is like this codeREQgtROUTERDEALERgt[REP, REP, ...]code where only one codeREPcode socket would handle a single request.p

Negative 33 pIm a VHDL newbie and Im struggling with the following idea. I think I still misunderstand the idea of counters and timers in VHDL. I will explain it with a simple blinking LED diode. BTW Im learning on Spartan3E FPGA kit. br So here is my code Im not using reset yetp  precodeentity toplevel is   Port clk  in STDLOGIC         led1  out STDLOGIC end toplevel  architecture Behavioral of toplevel is     signal timer  STDLOGICVECTOR25 downto 0  00000000000000000000000000      signal reset boolean false  begin       process clk      begin         led1 lt 1         if clk1 and clkevent then             if reset lt true then                 timer lt others gt 0             end if             timer lt timer  1         end if          if timer lt 11100100111000011100000000 then             led1 lt 0         end if     end process end Behavioral codepre  pThe oscillator frequency is 50 MHz so one period is 20 ns. If I want to blink with a LED for 1.2 second which makes 60 000 000 cycles I need to create a 26 bit vector. So I created a process which is triggered by clk change.br  bWHAT I THINK IT SHOULD DOb the first line of code is a logic 1 assignment to led1. So the led1 should light until the counter wont count 60 000 000 cycles. When counter counts 60 000 000 cycles, the led logic state should switch to 0 which means no light. As the maximum value of 26 bit number is 67 108 863, the LED should light for 60 000 000 cycles and be turned off for the remaining 7 108 863 cycles. Isnt that right br bWHAT IT DOESbMy impression is, that its kinda reversed. The LED is off for the most of the time 67 108 063 cycles and lights for 7 108 863 cycles. Why is this happening  I dont really get it.brbr bAdditional questionb How can I achieve to run this process only oncetwice... E.g. I want to blink with my LED 3 times and then turn it off. Because as far as I know after reaching maximum 26 bit number, the time vector will start counting from the beginning from 0. And so on, endlessly.p

Negative 33 pIm trying to extract a dates components from a given string and Ive discovered that strongdatevecstrong suits my needs perfectly. However I have two problems that Ill discuss based on the following examplep  precodedateString  12.03.09 1718  This is some random date as a string dateFormat  dd.mm.yy HHSS  This is the format of the date date  datevec dateString, dateFormat  Create a vector with each component being part of a date year,month,day etc. codepre  pExecuting  this example revealed to me two issuesp  ol listrongdatevecstrong scrambles my daymonthyear part of the date and spins it around so it becomes yearmonthdate. This does NOT correspond to my strongdateFormatstrong. It makes sense though since timewise year  month  day  hour  minute  second  ... but the question is Is this always happening or is it something that I did wrongli lipstrongdatevecstrong produces a 1x6 vector with the last component being the seconds in my date. I have discovered this completely by accident since my final goal is to havep  precode[year,moth,day,hour,minute]  datevec... codepre  pbut my initial experiments see code at the beginning showed me that the seconds are ALWAYS stored no matter what my format is. If seconds for example are not present in my strongdateStringstrong, the value is simply set to 0. The question here is again as in issue 1 Am I doing something wrong or is this how datevec always misbihavespli ol  pThe a hrefhttpde.mathworks.comhelpmatlabrefdatevec.html relnofollowdocumentationa is somewhat unclear here. It does say that strongdatevecstrong supports up to milliseconds as a fraction of seconds like HHSSMM.FFF with FFF being the milliseconds part however it does not tell at least I was unable to find it anything about the order in the resulting vector.p  pThe order is not too much of a big deal as long as this sort of behaviour is constant. Id like however to be able to tell strongdatevecstrong to store only those components of a date that I have chosen. For those of you who are going to say Its just one more number, whats the big deal I can simply reply It becomes a great deal memorywise if you have millions of dates that you have to work with. in my case  data mining.p  pThanksp

Negative 33 pI need help to better understand how codeCADisplayLinkcode and codedrawRectcode behave, so that I can figure out how to keep my apps framerate at a smooth 60fps. My presumably incorrect understanding so far is the followingp  p1 codeCADisplayLinkcode calls a specified selector when the display refreshes a socalled vsync event about every 16ms.p  p2 iOS uses double buffering, meaning that while one frame buffer is being displayed we can prepare draw to the other, and the two are swapped at the next vsync event.p  p3 Therefore, from the time the display link fires, I have about 16ms to ensure that all calculations and drawing required for the next frame has been completed, so that everything is ready by the time the buffers are swapped and the screen refreshes.p  p4 The drawRect method of a custom UIView draws to the back buffer, so any custom drawing is displayed at the next vsync event after the codedrawRectcode method is called.p  pIs this how it really works And what happens if the next vsync event happens before Ive finished drawing to the back bufferp  pThen, how should I use codeCADisplayLinkcode to redraw custom UIViews Ive tried calling codesetNeedsDisplaycode whenever the display link fires, but theres a delay before the drawRect method actually beginsp  precode20141210 191721.000 myApp[3948760b] Display link fired. 20141210 191721.001 myApp[3948760b] Sending setNeedsDisplay 20141210 191721.012 myApp[3948760b] drawRect beginning 20141210 191721.013 myApp[3948760b] drawRect finished 20141210 191721.017 myApp[3948760b] Display link fired. 20141210 191721.018 myApp[3948760b] Sending setNeedsDisplay 20141210 191721.029 myApp[3948760b] drawRect beginning 20141210 191721.031 myApp[3948760b] drawRect finished 20141210 191721.033 myApp[3948760b] Display link fired. codepre  pThis is a very simplified example, with almost no drawing being done in the codedrawRectcode method. Some of my more complex drawRects can take up to 10ms to complete. But there are only 5ms between when codedrawRectcode starts and the next display refresh Plus, there are 11 whole milliseconds apparently wasted between the display link firing and the drawRect beginning How do I make use of that timep  pIf I try calling codedrawRectcode directly in the display link selector, I get something like thisp  precode20141210 192441.000 myApp[3949560b] Display link fired. 20141210 192441.001 myApp[3949560b] Sending setNeedsDisplay 20141210 192441.002 myApp[3949560b] drawRect beginning 20141210 192441.003 myApp[3949560b] drawRect finished 20141210 192441.016 myApp[3949560b] Display link fired. 20141210 192441.017 myApp[3949560b] Sending setNeedsDisplay 20141210 192441.018 myApp[3949560b] drawRect beginning 20141210 192441.020 myApp[3949560b] drawRect finished 20141210 192441.032 myApp[3949560b] Display link fired. codepre  pNow my drawing code seems to have plenty of time to execute. However, the Apple documentation states explicitly that you should never call the codedrawRectcode method directly yourself. So why is this the wrong thing to do And how do I make maximum use of the 16 short milliseconds I have to draw each framep
Negative 33 pI am having some trouble with a Spring JMS application and have narrowed down the problem to be either a bug in the Spring framework or some weird misconfiguration on my part.p  pI listen to messages on a JMS JBoss 5 queue with a DefaultMessageListenerContainer which is configured like thisp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeDefaultMessageListenerContainer container  new DefaultMessageListenerContainer container.setSessionTransactedtrue container.setConnectionFactoryconnectionFactory A CachingConnecitonFactory container.setBackOffnew ExponentialBackOff container.setSessionAcknowledgeModeSession.SESSIONTRANSACTED container.setCacheLevelDefaultMessageListenerContainer.CACHENONE  .. more Queue specific configuration codepre  pI use a MessageListenerAdapter that is specified to call a certain handler method from my code and also is passed a a hrefhttpsgithub.comspringprojectsspringframeworkblobmasterspringjmssrcmainjavaorgspringframeworkjmssupportconverterMarshallingMessageConverter.java relnofollowMarshallingMessageConvertera which is set up with a JAXB marshaller to handle my classes.p  pThe setup works perfectly as long as my handler method does not throw an Exception. If that happens the message is returned to the queue as it should be and is shortly reevaluated by the ListenerContainer. This is expected behavior. However, the unmarshalling on the second try fails, because the MarshallingMessageConverter a hrefhttpsgithub.comspringprojectsspringframeworkblobmasterspringjmssrcmainjavaorgspringframeworkjmssupportconverterMarshallingMessageConverter.javaL295 relnofollowdoes not reset the pointer on the bytearray of the ByteMessage that is received from the queuea. This would not be a problem if the MessageContainer would create a new object for the second evaluation of the message, but it does infact pass the exact same object to the converter.p  pMy current workaround is to subclass the MarshallingMessageConverter and to overwrite the codeunmarshalFromBytesMessage..code method to do a codemessage.resetcode before calling codereadBytescode.p  pAs mentioned above, I can imagine two reasons for this behavior 1. This is simply a bug in the Spring provided MessageConverter this is also true for the SimpleMessageConverter. 2. My configuration is somehow messed up and should be different, creating a new object on every subsequent message receipt even if it is the same message on the queue.p  pShould I submit a fix to the Spring framework or this behavior intendedp

Negative 33 pIm working on a Web application that I decoupled it in multiple containerized microservices. I have now around 20 services, but the whole system will definitely need more than 300. Most of the services now and some in the future will not need an entire machine so Ill deploy multiple services on a same host. Im wondering how others deal with interservice communication. My preferred way was to go with a REST based communication but...p  pIsnt it too heavy to have multiple web servers running on the same machine Im developing in Ruby, but even a lightweight web server like Puma can consume a good amount of memoryp  pI started writing a custom communication channel using UNIX sockets. So, Id start one web server and  my router app would communicate with the currently running services on that host through UNIX sockets.  But I dont know if its worth the effort and on top of that, all services have to be written and customized to use this kind of communication. I believe it would be hard to use any framework like RubyonRails or others, even different languages which is the whole appeal with microservices architecture. I feel like Im trying to reinventing the wheel.p  pSo, can someone suggest a better approach or vote for one of my current onesp  pI appreciate any help,p  pThanks,p

This text will need to be printed very specifically on around 80 double sided pages.

I am also toying with the idea of having text cut off mid letter in one place and continued elsewherep  pNote that I have done this before, by manually placing text using a word processor. However, the sheer magnitude of this project really requires programming. I have thought about making some PNG files which is easy enough to do, but I do not know how nicely they will look when printed. I have also briefly looked at some standard document file formats like doc and pdf and it looks like itll take a long time before I can learn these last. p  pDoes anyone happen to have any helpful tips, or at least know the best file format to use for such a projectp  pThanksp

Negative 33 pI need to mock an external API request as part of a new cucumber test.  My usual practice is to first write the test that makes the call, and expect WebMock to complain about it.  Then using the information that WebMock provides, stub the request.  p  pBut in this repo which is new to me, WebMock does not intercept the request.  It just times out.  Even more curious, it behaves exactly as I expect in rspec it intercepts my request attempt, and tells me how to mock it, but not in cucumber.p  pI DO have this in codefeaturessupportwebmock.rbcodep  precodeWebMock.disablenetconnectallowlocalhost gt true codepre  pIve also tried putting that same line in codefeaturessupportenv.rbcode.  Still allows the request.  p  pI can figure out how to stub this another way, of course, but it bothers me that my tests could be making live calls if I make a mistake.  Can anyone helpp  pUPDATE  p  pIve determined that codeallowlocalhost gt true code does indeed keep the external requests from being made, but it does not trigger the WebMock mechanism that shows the bad request I assume by rescuing an exception, and instead the request simply times out.  Still dont know why.p

Do people alwaysvery often using JSON like this  DatabaseServer  JSON  Client.. what i mean by that is, all our data from database will be put into JSON, so people can use it easily to any other platformlanguage brp  pbecause from my point of view, if the data, which we need to output not much, why not just directly write on HTML directly, and if its a lot of data, why not use database If you dont mind please add an example case to use json brbr big thanks everyonep

Negative 33 pI have hit a roadblock in my access form and Ive searched high and low for an answer.  I have a form Enter Numbers in which users enter information that obviously is stored in a table Numbers.  I need to have a field  of models in the numbers table, however, I dont want to ask the users to input that information.  Furthermore, in another table property info I have that information already inputted.  Now before you tell me that it is redundant...blah blah blah, to store the same information in two tables.....the  of models field in the property info table may change, whereas by storing that number in the numbers table each time users enter info in the form, Im getting a snapshot that will not change. p  pI have a textbox that uses a dlookup function to pull the  of models from the property info table and displays it in the form.  I had and have no clue why it no longer functions properly a button in the form, that when pushed would run the following code  text66  models  Then I had a docmd.close so that it would put the dlookup result located in field models into text66 whose control source is the field  of models in the numbers table.  This was functioning flawlessly, and then something happened, and now when I click the button I receive a you cant assign a value to this object error.p  pI dont care by what method I copy the dlookup result into the numbers table, but I would certainly appreciate any help in doing so  Thanks.p

However, when I try to access that version again via the Plugin schema, the codeupdatedCheckscode value hasnt changed  I checked the codeidcode value on the version Im updating versus the version that gets pulled from the codePlugin.versionscode field and they are they same.  Do I need to remove the version from codePlugin.versionscode and reinsert a new one with the updated value  I also tried just updating the value and calling codesavecode but that didnt seem to work either.p

Negative 33 pI dont do a lot of web work, and when I do I generally stick to what I know. But I recently found bootstrap3 and I was intrigued. I checked out a few themes, found one that I liked.  It has a nice navigation that I will customize.  Included in the theme were a bunch of pages, each page seems to be solid html with the author having recoded the navigation on each page. I guess thats fine for a demo, but seems that it would add a lot of additional work, if you are updating the navigation, such that you would have to update every single page. My end project will have 4 or 5 pages. I dont want to have to redo all of them every time I want to add something to the navigation. p  pSo the question comes down to what I expect is either best practice or preference. Is it better to create 1 page with the navigation, and have a main content div that gets updated via javascript, or should I have several pages with a div that inserts the navigation via javascriptp  pIf I have 1 page and update the content, then I dont have to worry as much about session variables because you would stay on the same page all the time. If I have multiple pages, I would have to check the session variable, but it would also force having the browser rerender that navigation every single time. p  pIm torn. What is bestp

Negative 33 pHi I have been working on compiling an android image for my Samsung Note 3. Basically I downloaded the source from Samsung, which directed me to download a version of Android Open Source Project code.  I then followed the procedures in the readme files provided. But there are some discrepancies between the procedures and tools to be used from Samsung vs. Qualcomms documents. My question is about finding the right procedure, and get a working image. I have followed the Samsungs procedures, and they have not resulted in a working image as of now. I tried to flash the boot.img file I created, and collected the recovery logs which are posted a hrefhttppastebin.comvpxedp8e relnofollowherea I could be doing something wrong though I am not saying the procedures are wrong. So here are the issues I am struggling with p  p1 Samsungs readme file says to download armeabi4.7, while Qualcomm says to used 4.8 with their compiler add on llvm. As of now, I plan to try llvm with 4.7 and 4.8 and see what happens. I have already tried 4.7 wo llvm and it has not helped. p  p2 Samsung procedures state to update the CROSSCOMPILE statement with the path to above armeaby4.7 executable, export ARCHarm, then create a config file with the following statement p  precodemake VARIANTDEFCONFIGmsm8974sechltesprdefconfig msm8974secdefconfig SELINUXDEFCONFIGselinux defconfig  codepre  pand then run make. While Qualcomms llvm readme file states to issue the following command p  precodendkbuild NDKTOOLCHAINVERSIONsnapdragonclang3.6 APPABIarmeabiv7a C ltsomeprojectgt codepre  pI know I have to have a path to ndkbuild script and I know where it is. What I do not know isp  p1 If Samsungs procedures run ndkbuild also. I looked through the Makefile in the projects root directory and do not see any reference to it. Would the armeabi4.7 run ndkbuild perhaps p  p2 What is the best way to get to a working image for me I do not see the NDKTOOLCHAINVERSION and APPABI variables in the Samsungs .config file. Can I set these as environment variables  p  p3 Samsungs procedures state to set an environment variable of ARCHarm, while Qualcomms configuration passed to the ndkbuild is armeabiv7a p  p4 Qualcomms procedure calls for a project name. Is this something generic or would I find it somewhere in Samsungs files I did a search in the .config and Makefile and did not see any reference to it. p  p5 Are there any tags I should add to this post to get the attention of right folks who know and deal with questions like mine stated above p  pjww  Thanks. Ill try the procedure, and I am going through the material you shared. I hope I can have my other questions above addressed also.p  pUpdate  Hey I noticed I did not get any reply about actual issue. Another question I wanted to ask is if it helps to build an image, which provides more information about what is wrong with my image Do I do that via the config command p

Negative 33 pMy Java application heap dump shows that a specific lambda used in my class has locked up some amount of memory and its not being released during GC.p  pHeap shows the specific anonymous lambda class as strongParentClassLambdaIDstrong and in current case, the ID is 79image attached. This ID does not seem to have any relation with the number of lambdas that exist in the class and hence we cannot conclude on which lambda is represented. Im interested to point at the exact lambda expression as it helps in analyzing, fixing and testing the scenarios related.p  pDecompiling the class file with DJ did not help as it recreates the lambda expressions to a readable code. Let me know if any ideas on this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfYuDA.png altenter image description herep

Negative 33 pIm playing around with the Rust macro system in order to learn more about how it works. I wrote a simple macro which takes an identifier and adds a list of numbers to it.p  precodemacrorules doyourthing       vident eexpr,  gt          let mut v  0                      v  e                 fn main      doyourthingi 3, 3, 3     println, i  codepre  pIf I run a hrefhttpsplay.rustlang.orggistaf1161154ff2756acb8bampversionnightly relnofollowthis programa, the compiler will complain three times i being an unresolved name for every repetition inside the macro for v  ep  precodeltanongt513 515 error unresolved name i ltanongt5             v  e                       codepre  pI know that macros in Rust are hygienic. That is why I used the codeidentcode designator. Is it possible that there is an additional syntactic context for the repetition code...code p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAfter DK.s answer I did a little digging and found the codehygienecode argument for the codeprettycode option. Basically, it annotates the syntax contexts after macro expansion happened. After runningp  precoderustc Z unstableoptions pretty expanded,hygiene main.rs codepre  pon my initial program it gave me the following outputp  precodefn main  670       let mut i  684   0     i  683   3     i  683   3     i  683   3  codepre  pRunning the same command on DK.s modifications resulted inp  precodefn main  670       let i  684                        let mut i  685   0             i  685   3             i  685   3             i  685   3             i  685            codepre  pSo, the ... inside the macro did in fact introduce a new syntax context in my original macro. However, wrapping it in a block, as DK did, somehow prevented that from happening. Instead a new syntax context was introduced for the whole block.p

Negative 33 pRecently I made mostly out of curiosity a borderless form. After making my own title bar which includes the title, and the three buttonsminimize, maximize and close, just like every normal Windows program. I also made the code for these buttons just ask if you want to see the code.p  pHowever, Ive noticed that there are no animations. What I mean is that, e.g. if I click the minimize button, there is no animation, the program instantly disappears it doesnt close, the button works, but without an animation. This happens in all cases When I open the program it instantly appears, when I close it, it instantly disappears.p  pIs there some sort of way to use these animations that standard Windows programs usep
Negative 33 pI am building a page using Salvattore JS combined with Twitter bootstrap to build a responsive Pinterest like layout. There are no issues here and everything is working great.p  pWhere the problem lies is that I am trying to add embeds from Embed.Ly. When I use the code taken from a hrefhttpembed.lycode relnofollowherea everything works great on the initial page load, however when I resize the page and Salvattore kicks in, it updates the elements on the page and the rendered Embed.Ly embeds go invisible. I can see that the Embed.Ly markup is still on the page after the resize, however it is just invisible. p  pI have set up a quick a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netjh64fpsw relnofollowJS Fiddlea to show whats going on. I have dumped the Salvattore JS file into the JS window as they dont have a CDN to link to. On the JS fiddle I am getting a slightly different result however, in that when you press run you can see the embed for a split second before it dissapears, so slightly different to whats happening on my page but related nonetheless.p  pHere is the markup I am usingp  precodeltdiv idgrid datacolumnsgt ltdivgt     lta classembedlycard hrefhttpwww.mosseurope.co.ukshopbymodelmazdamx5brakesfrontbrakesbrakekitslotteddiscs41198.htmlgtS2000 VS MX5 REMATCHltagt ltdivgt ltdivgtItem 2ltdivgt ltdivgt     lta classembedlycard hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvALArNDw0QgtS2000 VS MX5 REMATCHltagt ltdivgt  ltdivgtItem 20ltdivgt codepre  pp  pIf anybody has some ideas as to what could be happening here that would be much appreciated.

Negative 33 pI am having a problem with my web user control WUC.  Whenever the page tries to it load, the browser gets a javascript error ReferenceError  is not defined.  This is occurring because my WUC is trying to execute some jquery before my scriptmanager on my master page is referenced.p  pFirst, my WUC is a menu bar that every web page will have.  I am actually referencing a dll file to create my user control, which it seems to use jquery to build the menu bar.  In order for the jquery to work, it needs to reference jquery1.11.3.  Now, as I mentioned, I have a master page that has a scriptmanager, and I am properly referencing jquery1.11.3 in it.  Also, just to clarify, my scriptmanager is the first tag in my form tag.p  pNow, the only way I can seem to get my WUC to load properly is by referencing jquery1.11.3 in the header contentplaceholder for each page specifically.  This is very redundant, and something I want to avoid.  Does anyone know how to solve this issuep

Negative 33 pI would like to develop an app that targets everything from Gingerbreadversion 2.3 API 9 to JellyBeanversion 4.3 API 18. p  pThe problem I need to transfer large images40 to 50 at a time either independently or in a zip file without the user having to click on each file being transferred. As far as I can tell I need to use the HttpClientorg.apache that was deprecated after JellyBean. p  pRight now the application takes the images and zips them to a zip file prior to uploading. I can create additional zip files, for example if I have 50MB to transfer I can make each zip file about 10MB and have 5 files to be transferred if I have to. I need to transfer these files to a web server. I cant seem to find anything about transferring files after Jellybean. All the searching Ive done uses the deprecated commands and the posts are 25 years old. I have installed andftp and transferred a 16MB zip file last night that was created by my app, but I really dont want to use that as it will require additional steps from the user. I will try andftp today and setup an intent to transfer the files to see how that works out. Supposedly andftp works until Lollipop5.0. If there is an easier way please let me know, hopefully Ive missed something about transferring files. Is there another way to do this after JellyBeanp

When the build order has been set I need to be able to merge propertyfiles from the selected modules with the propertyfile for the core so I endup with an assembledaggregated propertyfile with the aggregated properties from the core and all the selected modules.

Negative 33 pI am using one of those online application builders to build an android application. But from what i have researched, online application builders are used to build hybrid mobile applications. Since these are HTML files, they use the inApp browser and are rendered in WebView. So, My question is  Is webviewinApp Browser capable of remembering the session information suppose I have users log into a website by displaying it in a webview. Will the users be still logged in if they visit the website a second time When I test these applications in an online environment running inside a fullyfledged browser, the application seems to remember the user. I suspect this is because the test environment itself is contained within the browser which stores the session information. So, If a user was to sign into a website on a real device, will heshe be required to sign in every time the user launches an application or will heshe remain signed in until sign outp

Negative 33 pWe have migrated to CRM 2015 online, and we are experiencing an issues with Completed Phone Calls. When we open the form of one of those click for instance on the description field that is a textarea and then close it, we get prompted with a text message that says Your changes have not been saved. To stay on the page so that you can save your changes, click Cancel.p  pWe have no code running on that field, nor is the text changing. I assume there is some indentationnew linecarriage optimizing running on the form, but it is bothering us.p  pWe have autosave on, and we would like to keep it on.

In other words, if the user decides to display the listings inp  pstrongAstrong Price from lowest to highestp  pstrongBstrong Alt Viewp  p... and then click on page 2 where there are more of these listings, the layout and order will all go back to normal thus making the user have to reclick on the preferences they had chosen before on the first page  which means that this facility is pretty stupid if it cannot remember.p  pSo I know stronglocal storagestrong is the solution however I am battling to implement it with no success and thats probably because I am very new to it.p  pIve got other scripts that are using local storage and I am trying to copy what they did and try apply it to this.p  pLike for example, my attempt for the strongVIEW MODEstrong user option was addingp  precodelocalStorage.setItemviewmode, alt codepre  pSo to complete my method, the code would look like this  p  precode  jQuerydocument.readyfunction     .order a.layout.onclick, functione   e.preventDefault    ifthis.hasClassactive     do nothing if the clicked link is already active   return       .order a.layout.removeClassactive   this.addClassactive     var clickid  this.attrid   .listings.fadeOut240, function   ifclickid  thumbnailslist      this.addClassalt   localStorage.setItemviewmode, alt    else      this.removeClassalt       .listings.fadeIn200      codepre  pWhich doesnt work.p  pThats just for the VIEW MODE part ... now setting localstorage for the strongSORT BYstrong part seems a bit daunting  very higher grade and Ive attempted a few feeble attempts but I know Im not doing it right.p  pIs there a simple solution to apply local storage to both preference optionsp  pId really appreciate some help  guidance and I can imagine this would be a great solution for others looking to do the same with their project.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIve broken down the script to tackle just the VIEW MODE part of it all. See this a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netn2o70xgg1 relnofollowfiddlea and the following javascriptp  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction   .order a.layout.onclick, functione e.preventDefault  ifthis.hasClassactive     do nothing if the clicked link is already active   return   .order a.layout.removeClassactive this.addClassactive   var clickid  this.attrid .listings.fadeOut240, function    ifclickid  thumbnailslist      this.addClassalt     localStorage.setItemviewmode, alt        else      this.removeClassalt     localStorage.setItemviewmode, default        .listings.fadeIn200       codepre  pNotice in the javascript above, Ive created the setItemsp  precodeifclickid  thumbnailslist      this.addClassalt     localStorage.setItemviewmode, alt      else      this.removeClassalt     localStorage.setItemviewmode, default    codepre  pWhen I go on Chrome resources  local storage and test to see if these setItems are working, they are indeed.p  pMy problem is that I am battling to do the stronggetItemstrong part which is doing my head inp  h2strongLATEST UPDATE part 2strongh2  pNeil S has provided a great and simple solution for the VIEW MODE state Works like a charm p  pI am now trying to work on getting the strongSORT BY price or paxstrong see original  very first fiddle to also use local storage however this is proving to be much harder than I thoughtp  pPlease see this stronga hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netyq8eqz7d3 relnofollowfiddleastrong of my attempt to use local storage for the sort by PRICE.p  pWhat makes this more complicated is the fact that the strongsort bystrong can either go in ascending or descending order.p  pAs you can see in the fiddle, Ive done this and Ive done many other attempts but this looks most logicalp  precodeif localStorage.getItemsortby  price   function  ratingAscending  true var sorted  .listings.sortfunctiona,b      return priceAscending             convertToNumbera.findspan.html lt              convertToNumberb.findspan.html  1  1  priceAscending  priceAscending .results.appendsorted    codepre  pNothing special here ... all Ive done is replacedp  precode.container.onclick,.sortbyprice,function codepre  pwith p  precodefunction  codepre  p... because the click function is obsolete now that its a memory thing.p  pSurely that should workp  pIve tried thisp  precodeif localStorage.getItemsortby  price         this is where the answer probably lies      .container .results.appendsorted   codepre  pand no success.p  pI just need to have local storage remember that the user had chose the preference strongSORT BY  pricestrong ... so that when the user clicks on page 2 ... the listings on that page are also sorted by price.p
Negative 33 pIm using the standard ActiveModelAdapter in my Ember app to do most of my queries to work with Ember model object.p  pIn one case, however, I want to make a arbitrary REST request to get back JSON to populate a chart not backed by a model but I want to go through the ActiveModelAdapter so the correct host values are used.p  pHeres whats not workingp  precodeupdateChartFromIndustry function    Ember..ajax     context this,     method get,     url apiv3chartsallrisk.json,     dataType json,     data  ind this.getind    .thenfunctionjson        Ember.riskdaysdata.highchartsjson     ,     functionerrs        console.logerrs         .observesind, codepre  pIn development, that query goes to localhost4200 the ember server rather than the rails backend at localhost3000.  Explicitely setting the full URL makes the query go through but without the various user session informatino that authenticates the request. p  pIm really hoping for something simple likep  precodethis.store.queryarbitrary url and params, .... codepre  pas if I were making a normal query for a model or, alternately, to leverage the adapterp  precodeEmber.adapter..ajax....  codepre
Negative 33 pI have a 5 nodes consul cluster. When i run the DNS command below, it lists only three IPs at a time randomly. How can i have all 5 IPs listed at the same time randomly as opposed to three at a timep  precodedig  127.0.0.1 p 8600 servicename.service.consul  codepre
Negative 33 pI need to develop an application that will process csv files as soon as the files are created in a predefined directory. Huge number of incoming files is expected.p  pI have seen applications using Apache Commons IO File Monitoring in the production. It works pretty well. I have seen it processing as many as 21 million files in a day. It seems Apache Commons IO File Monitoring polls the directory and do listFiles to process the files.p  pMy question Is JDK WatchService as good an option as Apache Commons IO File Monitoring Does anyone know of any pros and consp
Negative 33 pIm trying to use R to extract data from a website where I have to select information from 5 dropdown menus and then click on an export or consult button a hrefhttp200.20.53.7dadosaguawebdefault.aspx relnofollowhttp200.20.53.7dadosaguawebdefault.aspxa. I found this excellent thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27381889gettingdatainrasdataframefromwebsourceGetting data in R as dataframe from web sourcea, but it didnt answer my question because of some differencesp  p1 The websites forms method is Post, not Getp  pI tried using the RHTMLForms package together with RCurl, in a way that would work for Post or Get.
