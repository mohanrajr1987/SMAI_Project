Positive 1292 pWith late static binding in PHP v5.3, one can usefully declare codestaticcode methods in interfaces with traits in PHP v5.4, methods can be either codestaticcode or codeabstractcode but not both.  This appears to be illogical and inconsistent.p  pIn particular, suppose one has an interface for which a trait provides all implementation, except for a static method unless that method is declared in the trait, static analysers balk at any references thereto from within the trait.  But providing a concrete implementation within the trait no longer forces implementingusing classes to provide their own implementationwhich is dangerous codeabstract staticcode would be ideal, but is not allowed.p  pWhat is the explanation for this contradiction  How would you recommend resolving this problemp  precodeinterface MyInterface      public static function getSetting     public function doSomethingWithSetting   trait MyTrait      public abstract static function getSetting  I want this...      public function doSomethingWithSetting          setting  staticgetSetting  ...so that I can do this          ...         class MyClass implements MyInterface      use MyTrait     public static function getSetting  return  ...    codepre

Positive 1292 pWhat is the best way to declare global instances of a function object so I can import and use the instances as callables throughout my programp  pSpecifically, I have created a template class which serves as a custom deleter for a shared pointer. Several pointer types in a third party library need to be deleted with a Free function that takes a reference to the pointer. An instance of the class is instantiated with the type of the pointer to delete, and a pointer to a function with the signature of the Free function.  I am declaring the instances as const because there is no need for the member function pointer to ever change.p  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt class Deleter  public   typedef typename boolCALLINGCONVENTION DeleterFuncT   DeleterDeleterFunc deleter  deleterdeleter    void operator T t  if t  deleterampt   private   DeleterFunc deleter   static const DeleterltIxgt xdeleterFreeXInterface codepre  pMy first attempt was a create instances for each of the pointer types in the .h file, but this resulted in multiply defined symbols if I include this header file in other code.  So I changed the declaration of the instances to static and this compiles and seems to work fine, but I have seen warnings that this is not a good idea especially if the objects belong to a namespace because static is causing the linkage to be fileonly, and that each compilation unit will have its own copy.p  pMy question is does this matter if I dont really care if they are the same instance between files I am not using this as global data, and the function objects dont really have any state. Would I have any concerns about threading if these objects are declared static Is there a better way to implement this without using the static keywordp
Positive 1292 pThis question is only meant to clear the concepts, so please do not emphasis on why would someone write up a class like thatp  pI already know that how static functions can be accessed without making an instance of an object means not modifying state of an object. But lets consider this case of two classes having only two functions in itp  precodeclass A       no class attributes       no constructor      public function someFunction           public static function someStaticFunction       codepre  pp  precodeclass B       no class attributes       no constructor      public function somefunction           public function someNonStaticFunction      with same implementation as of AsomeStaticFunction         codepre  pFor class A there is no constructor and attributes, and all the functions are public. So,p  ol liIs there any purpose of declaring a function as static for such classli liInstead of using class A, if I use class B then I can call the function after making an instance of this class. What would it cost to call the function like this In terms of execution time and memory considering no constructor and attributesli liMaking an instance of a class allocates memory to the object, but do the object consumes memory if it has no attributes at allli liDoes calling the function as static will automatically flushes out the memory, after the function is completely executed Or no memory is consumed by the function itself the only cost is computation and memory of the variables insideli ol

Do not change the structure of the codeMethodBcode in ClassB. Consider the fact that 50 other methods in static and non static classes must use a codeClassAcode field .

Positive 1292 pAfter reading a ton of documentation, I still dont have a good grasp on what exactly counts as a static vs. a  user uploaded file... or what exactly a static file is even. p  pstrong1. Static filesstrongp  pDjango a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevhowtostaticfiles relnofollowdescribesa static files as things like images, javascript, css. OK, makes sense. But all those .py files and .html template files etc... they arent static They dont change while the site is running. What exactly is a static file What does serving static files mean How is that different than serving a views.py file or a home.html file p  pOn top of that, why do I even need collectstatic anyway Why do all my static files need to be in one place I suppose if youre using a separate web server to serve them that makes sense... still, not sure what exactly that even means. p  pAlso, where does collectstatic go to find all the supposed static files anyway Does it go through all my code and see where Im accessing image  javascript filesp  pstrong2.

Positive 1292 pThis is the first time Im trying to compile and use a library on Windows. I downloaded the .exe that contains opencv3.0.0 on the official website and extracted it. I ignored the codebuildcode directory and used the CMake GUI on the codesourcecode directory to output two dirs, one named codesharedcode when I set CMake variable codeBUILDSHAREDcode to codetruecode and one named codestaticcode when I set this variable to codefalsecode.p  pIn the two of them I used codemake installcode in the root and in the codeincludecode directory and I got two similar codeinstallcode directories, the only difference being that the one in codesharedcode has codebincode and codelibcode dir in code.x86mingwcode and the one in codestaticcode has codebincode and codestaticlibcode. I merged them by moving the codestaticlibcode dir next to the codebincode and codelibcode dirs. So now I only have one codeinstallcode dir containing the codeincludecode and all the libraries.p  pThats where I dont really understand how to properly manage compiled libraries on windows.

Negative 1292 pBesides opensourcing your project and legislation, are there ways to prevent, or at least minimize the damages of code leaking outside your companygroupp  pWe obviously cant block Internet access to prevent emailing the code because programmers need their references. We also cant block peripheral devices USB, Firewire, etc.p  pThe code matters most when it has some proprietary algorithms and inhouse developed knowledge as opposed to regular routine code to draw GUIs, connect to databases, etc., but some applications like accounting software and CRMs are just that complex collections of routine code that are simple to develop in principle, but will take years to write from scratch. This is where leaked code will come in handy to competitors.p  pAs far as I see it, preventing leakage relies almost entirely on human process.

If I use a function like codefilegetcontentscode or codefopencode to connect to a socket the callback is invoked, but if I use codestreamsocketclientcode it does not.p  pI assume it should because Im passing the context to codestreamsocketclientcode and if I use codestreamsocketrecvfromcode I get the same string back from the socket as fgets would return.p  pRelevant PHP docs are linked at the end of the post.p  precodeclass IMAP        Connection Parameters     private host     private port     private timeout       Credentials     private email     private password      private client     private transcript      function constructconnection, credentials        Set Connection Settings     thisgthost  connection[host]     thisgtport  connection[port]     thisgttimeout  connection[timeout]       Set Credentials     thisgtemail  credentials[email]     thisgtpassword  credentials[password]       Connect to the IMAP server     params  arraynotificationgtarraythis, getLine     ctx  streamcontextcreate     streamcontextsetparamsctx, params     thisgtclient  streamsocketclienttcpthisgthostthisgtport,errno, errstr, thisgttimeout, STREAMCLIENTCONNECT, ctx     streamsocketsendtothisgtclient, a001 NOOPrn            function getLinenotificationcode, severity, message, messagecode, bytestransferred, bytesmax      args  funcgetargs       vardumpargs        connection   array     host gt somehost,     port gt 143,     timeout gt 10   credentails  array     email gt someemail,     password gt somepassword   imap  new IMAPconnection, credentails  gt codepre  pa hrefhttpus3.php.netmanualenfunction.streamcontextsetparams.php relnofollowhttpus3.php.netmanualenfunction.streamcontextsetparams.phpa a hrefhttpus3.php.netmanualencontext.params.php relnofollowhttpus3.php.netmanualencontext.params.phpap  pI found this somewhat related PHP bug report too, but it looks like the report was pointlessp  pa hrefhttpbugs.php.netbug.phpid42387ampedit1 relnofollowhttpbugs.php.netbug.phpid42387ampedit1ap

They are currently being saved as JPG files, and I want to insert them into a book that I am preparing for Print On Demand. p  pThe book is an OpenOffice ODT file, which will later be converted to a PDF.p  pCurrently I use JPG files, but the print facility they use requires 300 DPI, so I modified my diagramming tool to set the xDensity and yDensity to 300, and resUnits to 1, using getAsTree, and then expand the diagram by a factor of 3 30096.  IMO the result looks pretty goodp  pUnfortunately, someone on another forum pointed out that line diagrams are fuzzed on JPG files, so suggested that I change over to PNG, or possibly BMP files, both of which ODT files allow to be inserted.p  pMy problem is that BMPs dont seem to have a DPI, and PNGMetadata doesnt seem to support getAsTree.  Can someone point me in the right direction  Thanks.p

Negative 1292 pWithin an Infragistics 8.2 UltraComboEditor, we had the following properties set via Cp  precode        DataSource  dataSource         ValueMember  Measure         DisplayMember  Name         DataBindings.AddValue, repository, Measure         DataBindings[Value].DataSourceUpdateMode  DataSourceUpdateMode.OnPropertyChanged codepre  pwhere dataSource was an array of objects, each with a property Measure, and repository was an object with a property Measure.  Those strings are actually constructor parameters  just using explicit strings to simplify the example.p  pIn the course of some refactoring, the name of the property on the objects in the array was changed to BaseEnum the objects are actually wrapped enumerations, for the curious, but the name of ValueMember above was not changed.  And yet, the combo box binding continued to work through initial testing, beta testing, and even after release... until two customers emailed in noting that the combo box was no longer changing the underlying parameter.

Negative 1292 pBy common script startup sequence, what I mean is that in the majority of pages on my site, the first order of business is to consult 3 specific files via codeincludecode, which centrally define constants, certain functions used in many scripts, and a class or two, as well as providing the database credentials. I dont know if theres a more standard term for such a setup.p  pWhat I want to know is whether its possible to have too many of these and make things slower as a result. I know that using codeincludecode has a certain amount of overhead because its another file to look for in the filesystem, parse, and execute. If there is such a thing as too many codeincludecodes, I want to know whether I am anywhere near that point. N.B. Some of my pages codeincludecode still more scripts that they specifically, individually need for example, a script that defines a function used by only a few pages, and I do not count these occasional extra codeincludecodes, which are used reasonably sparingly anyway. Im only worrying about the 3 codeincludecodes that occur on the majority of pages and set everything up.p  pWhat are the 3 codeincludecodesp  pTwo of them are outside of webroot. codecommon.phpcode defines a bunch of functions, classes and other things that do not vary between the development and production sites. codeconfig.phpcode defines various constants and paths that are different in the development and production sites which database to connect to, among other things. Of course, its desirable for this file in particular to be outside of webroot. codeconfig.phpcode codeincludecodes codecommon.phpcode at the bottom.p  pThe other one is inside webroot and contains a single linep  precodeinclude [path to appropriate directory]config.php codepre  pThe directory differs between the development and production sites.p  pFeel free to question the rationale behind setting up the codeincludescode this way, but I feel that this does provide a good, reliable system for preparing to execute each page, and my question is about whether it is bad to have that many codeincludecodes as a baseline on each page.p

Negative 1292 pI am developing some scientific software for my university. It is being written in C on Windows VS2008. The algorithm must calculate some values for a large number of matrix pairs, that is, at the core resides a loop iterating over the matrices, collecting some data, e.g.p  precodesumA  sumAsq  sumB  sumBsq  diffsum  diffsumsq  return  0 for int y0 y lt height y      for int x0 x lt width x               valA  matrixAx,y         valB  matrixBx,y         sumAvalA         sumAsqvalAvalA         sumBvalB         sumBsqvalBvalB         diffsumvalAvalB         diffsumsqvalAvalBvalAvalB       return  sumA  sumB  sumAsq  sumBsq  diffsum  diffsumsq codepre  pThis routine is executed millions of times for different matrixA, matrixB pairs. My problem is that this program is extremely slow, compiled in Release mode with all optimizations activated. Using the pausewhenbusyandinspect debugger technique, I established that the program sits inside this loop virtually emeveryem time, even though, as you might expect, this routine is surrounded by a whole bunch of conditions and control branches. What puzzles me the most is that during its execution on a dualprocessor Xeonbased system, the program utilizes one of the 4 cores no surprise, it is singlethreaded for now but only up to about 25 of its limit, and with relatively large oscillations, where I would expect steady, 100 load until the program terminates.p  pThe current version is actually a rewrite, created with optimizing the performance in mind. I was devastated when I found out its actually slower than the original. The previous version used Boost matrices, which I replaced by OpenCV matrices, after having established them to be over 10 times faster in comparing the execution time of multiplying two 1000x100 matrices. I access the matrix by manually dereferencing a raw pointer to its data which I hoped would gain me some performance. I made the calculation routine a multiline define macro to enforce its inlining and to avoid function calls and returns. I improved the math behind the calculations so that the final value is calculated in a single pass through the matrices the old version requires two passes. I expected to get huge gains and yet the opposite is true. Im nowhere near my old programs efficiency, not to mention commercial software for the particular application.p  pI was wondering if it perhaps had something to do with the matrix data being 8bit chars, I once saw that access to floats was actually slower than to doubles in my old program, perhaps chars are even slower since the processor retrieves data in 32bit chunks this Xeon probably grabs even 64bits. I also considered turning the matrices into vectors to avoid a loopinsideloop construct, as well as some form of vectorization, like for example calculating the data for 4 less more consecutive matrix cells on a single loop iteration.

Negative 1292 pOne thing that Ive always hated more than just about anything in MS SQL Server is the way that security works. The security context constantly switches if you look at the server funny and its often very hard for me anyway to predict or debug.p  pIn dealing with an issue today, I though, I wish I could just add a line to my code that would display the security context that SQL Server is using when this code runs. Does such a command exist For example, codeSELECT securitycontextcodep  pTo be a little clearer... if Im in a stored procedure and am therefor subject to the security context of the owner of the SP then Id like to see that. If Im in code that was called by spexecutesql and its causing the security to be under the context of the SQL Server service account, then I would want to see that.p  pAt least then I might be able to figure out why SQL Server thinks that I shouldnt have access to something.p  pThanksp  hr  pstrongEXAMPLEstrongp  precode Set up CREATE USER TestUser WITHOUT LOGIN CREATE TABLE TestSecurityContext myid INT INSERT INTO TestSecurityContext VALUES 1 DENY SELECT ON TestSecurityContext TO TestUser GO CREATE PROCEDURE TestSecurityContextSP AS   SELECT SUSERSNAME   SELECT  FROM TestSecurityContext   This will return ok   EXECSELECT SUSERSNAME SELECT  FROM TestSecurityContext   SUSERSNAME will match above but select fails GO GRANT EXECUTE ON TestSecurityContextSP TO TestUser GO   Switch to the new user SETUSER TestUser GO   Do the test EXEC TestSecurityContextSP GO   Clean up SETUSER DROP PROCEDURE TestSecurityContextSP DROP TABLE TestSecurityContext DROP USER TestUser GO codepre

These devices need to be able to do two things.p  ol liGrab new config from the server. I suspect I can just do this via a http get from the device to the server and pull down some XML, then reload its own config.li liOpen an ssh connection to the server to allow an admin to login to the command line of the device and do maintenance and troubleshooting remotely.ie device  server lt admin and admin can get to bash command line or equivalent. li ol  pthe device is a low powered embedded device that will be running linux. A solution in python would be preferable im thinking something with paramiko for the ssh but im open to other solutions. The main thing is there is there will be no technical users in the private network, so it should be able to plug into a consumer grade ADSL modem, get a DHCP address and all this should work. I can preload the device with anything before hand, for example ssh certificates for passwordless ssh etc.p  panybody got any ideasp  pCheersp  pMarkp

Negative 1292 pstrongProblem statement strong The virtual keyboard is required in linux environment which should be launched every time when user presses on editable UI components, like virtual keyboard in iPhone, iPad, Android, etc.p  pstrongSolution overview strong As basis for virtual keyboard was taken matchboxkeyboard which is an opensource application and provides rich functionality. The mechanism of autotoggling was solved by modifying the source of QT and GTK to send Dbus signals on onpress signal when user presses on editable UI comp. to some daemon which turns virtual keyboard on.p  pstrongIssue strong onpress Dbus signal is sent when user presses or clicks on UI components i.e. during onclick event of QT and GTK. The virtual keyboard is hidden on focusout event of QT and GTK. Keyboard is not switched on during focusin event because some application while launching are emitting focusin event for a moment then emitting focusout event, so virtual keyboard was shows for a short time then hidden which was not accurate. this was solved by generating onpress Dbus signal during onclick GTK and QT events. p  pSo now here I have another problem.p  ol liLets say user pressed on editable box, virtual keyboard appeared,  onclick GTK, QT event  onpress Dbus signal  virtual keyboard is launchedli liThen user presses on Tab button to switch to other editable box. focusout GTK, QT event  hidekeyboard Dbus signal  virtual keyboard is hidden and is not launched again.li ol  pThis happens because the second editable box emits focusin event and not onclick event. p  pSo please help to find a solution for the case when user switches between editable box with tab button.

I thought this would be a fairly easy task, but I still havent managed to come up with something that just works over a wide variety of Android phones.p  pThe first thing I tried was this p  pstrongDefine an intent showing a list of apps capable of sending the vCardstrongp  precodeIntent i  new IntentIntent.ACTIONSEND i.setTypetextxvcard i.putExtraIntent.EXTRATEXT,MMS with vCard i.putExtraIntent.EXTRASTREAM, Uri.parse someFilereference startActivityIntent.createChooseri, Select MMS application. codepre  pWhen using this, I noticed the following p  ul liOn a strongSamsung Galaxy Sstrong, the chooser allowed me to pick Bluetooth,Gmail strongand the Messaging appstrong. When using the Messaging app, the attachment and text was present, and I could send the MMS. I processed the MMS on an old Sony Ericson phone preandroid and the vCard was processed fine.li liOn a strongGoogle Nexus Sstrong and strongMotorola DroidXstrong, the chooser only allowed me to pick Bluetooth and Gmail. strongthe Messaging app was missing from the chooserstrong.li ul  pMy conclusion  It appears that Android doesnt come with a stock application that is capable of satisfying the Intent specified here. no app allows with the textxvcard mimeType. The Galaxy S comes with its own Messaging app that is capable of handling the vcard mimetype.p  pThats all very well, but how do we go about and solve this p  pI tried the following approach  p  pstrongLaunch the messaging intent directly by specifying the classstrongp  precodeIntent intent  new IntentIntent.ACTIONSEND  i.setClassNamecom.android.mms, com.android.mms.ui.ComposeMessageActivity  i.setTypetextxvcard i.putExtrasmsbody, SomeText i.putExtraIntent.EXTRASTREAM, Uri.parse someFileRef   startActivityi  codepre  pUsing this code, the messaging app is launched directly. This approach was choosen as it at least allows us to pop a messaging app on the Nexus S before with the chooser, the messaging app was not present.p  pOn the strongSamsung Galaxy Sstrong, the attachment is added on the MMS compose screen and is correctly sent. On the strongGoogle Nexcus Sstrong, the attachment is not present.p  pWhen removing the mimeType from the Intent, the Messaging app pops an strongUnsupported media typestrong error message.p  pSo the questions is  is there a simple and uniform piece of code that allows you to send an MMS with a vCard attachment p

Negative 1292 pI have a view that holds some UIButtons.  Another view covers and hides the buttons.

Negative 1292 pI have a bunch of big files, each file can be over 100GB, the total amount of data can be 1TB and they are all readonly files just have random reads.p  pMy program does small reads in these files on a computer with about 8GB main memory.p  pIn order to increase performance no seek and no buffer copying i thought about using memory mapping, and basically memorymap the whole 1TB of data.p  pAlthough it sounds crazy at first, as main memory ltlt disk, with an insight on how virtual memory works you should see that on 64bit machines there should not be problems.p  pAll the pages read from disk to answer to my reads will be considered clean from the OS, as these pages are never overwritten. This means that all these pages can go directly to the list of pages that can be used by the OS without writing back to disk OR swapping wash them. This means that the operating system could actually store in physical memory just the LRU pages and would operate just reads when the page is not in main memory.p  pThis would mean no swapping and no increase in io because of the huge memory mapping. p  pThis is theory what Im looking for is any of you who has every tried or used such an approach for real in production and can share his experience are there any practical issues with this strategyp

Negative 1292 pIm writing some code that does date and time calculations against the current time. In Joda time, this is accessed through a Java constructor, as it is an immutable object.

Negative 1292 pWe are currently evaluating failover support in different databases.br We were earlier using HSQLDB but it seems that it does not have clusteringreplication support.  p  pOur requirement is simply to have two database servers, one being only for synchronous backup but if the primary server is down, then the secondary should automatically start acting as the primary server.p  pHas anyone evaluated MySQL, PostgreSQL or any other DB server for such a use case p  pEdit We had thought of using MySQL cluster but it now seems that it is under GPL license which we wont be able to work with. Could anyone please suggest a synchronous replicationclustering solution which can be used We are currently using HSQL, so a solution with HSQL used in clustered mode will be ideal for us but we are open for change.p

Negative 1292 pI have read the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2529184differencebetweenmethodandfunctioninscalaDifference between method and function in Scalaa and many articles about differences between method and function. I got a feeling that a method is just a named function defined as a method in a class, a trait or an object. A function represents things like the anonymous function or function literal or function object in those articles. An evidence can be found in the book Programming in Scala  a hrefhttpwww.artima.comshopprogramminginscala2ed relnofollowhttpwww.artima.comshopprogramminginscala2eda , page 141, section 8.1, The most common way to define a function is as a member of some object. Such a function is called a method.p  pHowever, when I checked the Scala Language Reference a hrefhttpwww.scalalang.orgdocufilesScalaReference.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.scalalang.orgdocufilesScalaReference.pdfa, there are concepts like named method. In page 91, Section 6.20 Return expressions A return expression return e must occur inside the body of some enclosing named method or function.  You can also find the term named function in the same page and other places. p  pSo my question is, in Scala, do method,  named method, and  named function refer to the same concept Where do you get the definition of named function p  pIn code codeList1, 2.map  1code, the original expression code  1code is a named method, then the method is converted into a function. What kind of function,  anonymous function, function object, named function p  pIn my understanding, Scala only has two types of function a named function that is a method an anonymous function that is a function literal. Function literal is compiled into a function object of trait FunctionN for it to be used in the pure objectoriented world of Scala.  p  pHowever, for a regular named funcitonmethod such as code  1code in the above code, why does Scala transform it into another function object p

Negative 1292 pIm looking for a efficient data structurealgorithm for storing and searching transliteration based word lookup like google do a hrefhttpwww.google.comtransliterate relnofollowhttpwww.google.comtransliteratea but Im not trying to use google transliteration API. Unfortunately, the natural language Im trying to work on doesnt have any soundex implemented, so Im on my own.p  pFor an open source project currently Im using plain arrays for storing word list and dynamically generating regular expression based on user input to match them. It works fine, but regular expression is too powerful or resource intensive than I need. For example, Im afraid this solution will drain too much battery if I try to port it to handheld devices, as searching over thousands of words with regular expression is too much costly.p  pThere must be a better way to accomplish this for complex languages, how does Pinyin input method work for example Any suggestion on where to startp  pThanks in advance.p  hr  pEdit If I understand correctly, this is suggested by Dialecticusp  pI want to transliterate from strongLanguage1strong, which has 3 characters codea,b,ccode to strongLanguage2strong, which has 6 characters codep,q,r,x,y,zcode. As a result of difference in numbers of characters each language possess and their phones, it is not often possible to define onetoone mapping.p  pLets assume phonetically here is our associative arraystransliteration tablep  precodea gt p, q b gt r c gt x, y, z codepre  pWe also have a valid word lists in plain arrays for strongLanguage2strongp  precode... px qy ... codepre  pIf the user types codeaccode, the possible combinations become codepx, py, pz, qx, qy, qzcode after transliteration step 1. In step 2 we have to do another search in valid word list and will have to eliminate everyone of them except codepxcode and codeqycode.p  hr  pWhat Im doing currently is not that different from the above approach. Instead of making possible combinations using the transliteration table, Im building a regular expression code[pq][xyz]code and matching that with my valid word list, which provides the output codepxcode and codeqycode.p  pIm eager to know if there is any better method than that.p

Negative 1292 pI have question regarding on how to display the values into the Android Client from online database in MySQL using the PHP Web Service. The idea is such that initially when the activity is displayed, the first record must be displayed in the textview. There would be a button called Next which would display the next record and move the cursor to the next record in the database. My question is that the move to next record logic should be written in which place That means should I write the movetonextrecord  code in the Android client or should I write in the PHP code p  pFor the basic understanding of how to connect to an online db in Android Client I had referred to the question in this forum itself a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4124805connecttoremotedatabaseonlinedatabaseConnect to Remote DB a which gave me a good understanding on how to connect to remote db.

Negative 1292 pI am a newbie here, so I apologize if my question seems weird. This is about my SPH simulator, which not be able to handle fluidsolid interaction yet. My simulator can simulate fluid well, but I got confused when I want to add a solid object during the simulation.p  pIve read many paper, and I got several conclusion in my mind, please correct me if Im wrong,p  ol liBoth of solid and fluid object are modeled with single particle system, which each object particle has own parameter value, like mass, mass density, artificial viscosity, etc.  li liIn each time step, SPH loop procedure is computed as usual in both of object, means that each particle object can contribute to another particle object if they are in radius of h, regardless what kind is that particle.     li liThe difference with system that contains only fluid particles, is in fluidsolid system, exists Elastic Force that computed only between solid object. This force is not computed for fluid particle.li ol  pThat is. At last, the questions.p  pWhat about SPH specific parameters like smoothing length, radius of particle, etc Are these different between solid and fluid when computing forces for each particle What actually correct way when calculating forces for both kind of particle Is it just compute it in single loopingp  pThe papers Ive read tells me the formula, but I think I need the basic idea first.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1292 pIve recently come on board with a PHP application.  There has not been much design put into the app  there is a front controller, however, view, model and controller code is usually mixed together.p  pI would like to slowly start refactoring the code beginning with moving all the SQL queries into appropriate models.  Having looked at a few frameworks, it seems that most frameworks are setup with the assumption that an app will be developed from scratch using that framework.p  pIs there a good framework that I can just kind of plugin so that I can use the model libraries and then perhaps later on, integrate more of the app into the framework  Would Doctrine be a good tool for something like this  Or should I just setup my own models without relying on thirdparty librariesp
Negative 1292 pHope you can help. I have been trying to resolve this for a week but not getting anywhere and cant quite piece together what I need  My scripting skills are far from great so please forgive my naivety strongOk, The Problem......strong I have an IIS server that has multiple sites that all save their logs in a separate directory, I need to copy the logs from the last 24 hours to a local directory on my machine so I can analyse these in Log Parser Lizard GUI Version on a daily basis. I can map a drive from the remote server to my local machine via a hardware VPN, so this makes things a bit easier. Using the forfiles command I can recurse the directories to find the logs that are only a day old, and using either copyxcopy or Robocopy I can set a command to copy. My problem is that the IIS logs all have the same name so my copy command just keeps overwriting the previous file, rather than creating a new file. I have tried using the random parameter for the file name, but this again creates one random file that is overwritten with the next file, keeping the same name instead of creating lots of randomly named files in one directory. I know that Log Parser commands include recurse, which I have used successfully, however the format of the log is changed slightly and the GUI Lizard cannot read the data within, so this is not a solution. My code as it stands at this time is shown below, with IPs changed for obvious reasons. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp  pecho offp  pNET USE Q Delete yesp  pNET USE Q 255.255.255.255DLogsp  pcd Cp  pRD S Q CWeblogsProductionp  pMD CWeblogsProductionp  pforfiles.exe p Q s m .log d 0 c cmd c robocopy S XC XN XO file CWeblogsProductionrandom.logp  pNET USE Q deletep  pexitp

Negative 1292 pIm developing a Rails app with a lot of dependencies on external APIs, for example Delicious.  All APIs share two workflowsp  ul liOn the first call they are going to load all data since the beginning of time.li liAll following calls will load data filtered by the last execution time if supported.li ul  pTesting them in real means I must create a test account for each API or at least use my private one. Even with a hrefhttpsgithub.commyronmarstonvcr relnofollowcodeVCRcodea, because they would be called once. And my biggest problem I would have to mess around a lot with codeDatecodes and codeTimecodes to emulate the two different workflows mentioned above. Though a hrefhttpsgithub.comjtrupianotimecop relnofollowcodeTimecopcodea makes it really easy, it feels like a pain in the ass.p  pAnother approach is to fake the API calls and their corresponding responses completely, but this means no real tests and furthermore I would never realize changes or problems with the APIs.p  pAny suggestions Maybe a good combination of both waysp

Negative 1292 pI am writing a stackable file system which would rename unlinked files to a particular folder say abc by default. So as any file xyz is unlinked its renamed to abcxyz. I want to do this by overriding the unlink function of stackable file system. I am using wrapfs so I am modifying wrapfsunlink for this. I have dentry of the unlinked file also I have inode of parent directory , now I need to have inode of abc and dentry of abcxyz to call vfsrename instead of vfsunlink. I could find the dentry and vfsmount for the  so I have a dentry for  but I dont know how to get the dentryinode of abc I know I can get inode from dentry but I cannot get dentry also. I tried using lookuponelen abc is created but still it returns a negative inode , also I tried to use vfspathlookup to find the directory abc it also returns an error. Am I using wrong functions Or these methods see cache only not the actual directory structure  Please help.p

Negative 1292 pI have had an existing iOS iPhone app in the app store for the past several months v1.0. Everything on that app worked just fine. p  pI have been spending the past several weeks creating a new version of the app. I thoroughly tested the app before submitting it to Apple for an update. p  pApple approved the update v1.1 and the app works just fine on a firsttime install. The issue I run into is that if you are updating from a previous version, the new version downloads, but when you open it up, the app is broken. In fact, it appears to be a cached version of the old app, with blank screens and missing icons.p  pUnfortunately, I did not perform an update scenario test prior to sending the app in for review.p  pSince my apps code base has changed significantly, it appears as if there are some leftover cached files inside of the iPhone apps Documents directory from the previous version of my app that are at fault.p  pI am trying to prepare an updatefix that detects the presence of the old cache files in Documents and Library and remove them. Thus treating the app as a new install, rather than trying to merge code from the previous versions cache.p  pAnyways, I was wondering if other folks have run into this issue, and if there are any tips on how I should proceed.p  pThanks in advance for any insight.p  pBest Regardsp

Negative 1292 pIm sorry in advance if this question is flawed. Im pretty new to databasesI have set them up but not used them much in my development learning. p  pstrongBackGroundstrong  I have a process that generates alot of test data, its basically a hashtable with several hundred million records every daybut at the end of the day I can delete those records.  Generating the data takes too long on one machine so Im splitting the process up over several servers, which basically need to look up a databaseor currently hashtable and if it exists do some work and if it doesnt exist then add it. I thinkso far my needs is a database that can handle the large amount of writes in a consistent wayi.e. updates should be avail. instantly and the database should be able to effectically transfer this table over the network to other worker nodesafter the table is created another job runs that is based on it, but I dont think a single server server a 10 gig table to several servers is efficent so I was thinking it needs to be distributed.p  pstrongProblemQuestionstrong If I use a NoSql solution, like Hbasewhich I have a bit of experience setting up, will my application logic work  If I have 2 servers writing to a distributed database, is there any chance that server1 added an entry but when server2 looks it up it cant find it because it hasnt replicated though the cluster yet  Also, is there a better way to do what Im trying to do Would a single serverI also am considering just using mysql with no distribution work betterI was avoiding it because I wanted a solution that if was too slow I could simply add more worker servers to write to a database, Im not sure if my performance returns would diminish if I add 100 workers to write to a single serverp  pAny tips or suggestions would be great.p  pThanksp  pUpdate I just realized that facebooks messaging infrastructure uses hbase.  If it was not consistent that I would be getting crazy delays when messaging my friends.

Negative 1292 pI am using the excellent modification to Pythons PIL by Etienne a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma43552811264727from herea. What I need is exactly what the modification does  to save a JPEG file using the same quantization tables as the original. Doing it through that modification seems elegant, Im currently achieving that by using a hodgepodge of C code.p  pMy problem is that I get a JPEG file object in PIL, but after any modification it becomes an object of some other type. What I want is to take the image, crop it and save it with the same quantization table.p  pI tryp  precodeimg  Image.opensomeimage.jpg width, height  img.size crop  img.crop8, 0, width, height img  img.resizewidth  8, height img.pastecrop, 0,0 img.savecrop.jpg, qualitykeep codepre  pThe img object is first a PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile but becomes just an Image after the resizepaste operation. So consequently I cant use qualitykeep as its no longer a JPEG. Ive tried cropping and pasting as above, I tried a few other ways but nothing seems to preserve the JpegImageFile object. p

To add some context, here is an example of the alignment stringbr br example  28G11AC10T32br br Here is how to interpret the string the first 28 bases match the sequence, then there is a G mismatch 29th base total, the next 11 bases match 40th base total, an A mismatch 41st base total, C mismatch 42nd base total, and so on...br br I need to find out the base position where there are mismatches ie, the string has a character instead of digits and store that into an int array so that I can look this up in a later subroutine.br br So here is where my issue comes into play.

When the payment is done Paypal send back all data IPN to paypal script including all information sent via using the form. In that case I should be able to check if the transaction was completed and if so doing the parser of the reply and send data via email using PHP to seller. Is it correctp  pDoes anyone can show me a simple examplep  pThanks a lot.p

The SQL Set theory of applying the resursive nature is a little harder.p  pMany thanks, Bertie.p

Negative 1292 pI have a web application which often takes an inordinate amount of time to deploy on Tomcat.

Negative 1292 pI have a simple Backbone view which uses jQuery UIs buttons.p  pFor example I have a delete button, which should delete the model and view. I managed to add the button to the view in the render method using the followingp  precodevar self  this this.el.finddeleteButton.buttontext  false this.el.finddeleteButton.bind click, self.deleteView codepre  pand then I have the corresponding method in the viewp  precodedeleteView function     console.logthis.model  codepre  pThe deleteView method gets called, but it will print undefined to the console, as this is referring to the button and not the view. Replacing this with self doesnt work either.

Negative 1292 pWhat Im trying to dop  pCreate a grid once the page loads with some settings, then rather than using post backs to regenerate this grid I want to use nice quick service methods, i.e. page change, filter resultsp  pWhat Id usually do is recreate the html based on a DTO that the service passed back. Now the issue I have is that Im in effect creating the Html in two places in the asp.net page and also in the JavaScript.p  pNow I know this could be done by using MVC in the same application, creating a partial, rendering it on the server and sending back the Html After adding the model to it.. But it seems a bit hackyp  pAlternatively I could create the html in the code behind, but that seems a bit crap, would be great to have it in a html like editor.. again like a partial..p  pAm I missing something really obvious, is there a cleaner way Still using ASP.netp

See a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netTXPcM relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netTXPcMap  pAfter zooming and panning around use shiftclick to zoom out press the Default Zoom button then try to pan around again. Youll notice a jarring shift as it resets to the state prior to the button press.p  pThe code is a bit of a prototype and fairly long winded  but look for the applyZoom function.

Negative 1292 pLets imagine there is a LED. It blinks on and off with a period of 0.5 seconds. So on second 0  0.5 it is on, from second 0.5  1 it is off, from second 1 1.5 it is on again.p  pLets imagine I want to read that input from outside camera say iphone camera.  What I do is 1. Take input stream, make image out of it, scan the image for presence of certain number of white pixels, if it is there, the led is on, I write 1 to my file. If it is not there I write 0. I read input stream twice a second. So generally speaking if everything goes well and my processing does not lag somewhere I get good results. But imagine ifp  p0  0.5 LED is ON 0.49  my camera reads info as 1p  p0.5  1.0 LED is OFF  0.99  my camera reads info as 0p  p1.0  1.5 LED is ON 1.51  my camera lagged and reads it as 0p  pSo we have data corruption here. Question is, how do I synchronise reading so it preferrably goes into the middle of this window, for larger margin of error. Also imagine if Im trying to do that 10 times per second.

Negative 1292 pIve got some Java code uses JDBC to connect to a MySQL database, then the code does some read operations then a single update, all using the same connection. If there is an exception, then codeconnection.rollbackcode is called if theres no exception, codeconnection.commitcode is called.

My code only ever creates one connection, and it is used throughout the test.p  pThe connection being used has codeconnection.setAutoCommitfalsecode called immediately after the connection instance is created.p  pFor some reason, when there is an exception and codeconnection.rollbackcode is called, it turns out that my update has been committed rather than rolled back.p  pVia debugging, I have confirmed the following,p  ul lipAfter calling codeconnection.setAutoCommitfalsecode, codeconnection.getAutoCommitcode returns a value of codefalsecode, as expected.

Negative 1292 pIm using two libraries in an android app Im trying to make. New to android. The app is for connecting to serial devices and controlling their console via a terminal. p  pOne library is for setting up a serial connection, setting baud rate etc and can also write readdata over serial.. The other is for creating a terminal session. I have no problem running these libraries to get simple separate examples up and running. Eg, with the first library I can set up a serial connection with a router and sendreceive data via textboxes which looks like thisp  pa hrefhttpslh5.ggpht.comR4CAJXY9ZPDVsgt8jUZg5hcv81aa70sctiegIGDjzv2lyvuG6OZyYas4Ihes4Aq relnofollowhttpslh5.ggpht.comR4CAJXY9ZPDVsgt8jUZg5hcv81aa70sctiegIGDjzv2lyvuG6OZyYas4Ihes4Aqap  pWith the second library I am able to set up local terminal on a tablet and look at the directories etc. My problem lies in incorporating both of these together to have a terminal that is connected to a serial device and with the layoutpassing of data.p  pIn the terminal library I need to supply an InputStream and OutputStream to provide input and output to the terminal. So I have to call setTermInjava.io.InputStream and setTermOutjava.io.OutputStream to connect the input and output streams to the emulator.p  pIn the serial library however there are two methods for sending and receiving and these deal with arrays of bytes.  sendDatabyte[] data for sending data and a dataListener for receiving data. I have to implement this and code the method onDataReceivedint id, byte[] data with id being the name of the device.p  pSo my question is, how do I hook these up Do I create java.io.InputStreamOutputStream implementations on top of sendData and OnDataReceived, just convert the arrays to streams and call the setTermInOut methodsp  pFor OnDataReceived I suppose all I do is receive the byte[] data and convert it to a stream inside the method and send this to the terminalActivity but what about sendData, I am not implementing this, I just send an array of bytes, how do I send it as a stream instead to setTermInp  pI am also very confused about having these things happening in different activities and how that works. Because I have the serial stuff happening in one activity, so I hit connect, it reads the relevant baud rate etc and connects to the serial device, then a terminal is opened in a new terminalActivity which is currently connected to nothing, just looks like a blank terminal. Im not sure how everything should be laid out. Like if I hit the enter key in a terminal, should the implementation for sending data over serial not be in that same activity, not the one I am initially in where I am connecting to a serial device But to know if I am connected to a serial device in the first place I need to sendreceive data...should there be implementations of these methods in both activities Or maybe I should simplify it and add the connection options and the terminal to the same activityp  pShould I be combining these both in one activity maybep

Negative 1292 pIve worked with various ORMs and database abstractions designed to make it easy to work with multiple databases, both relational and not. The more comprehensive solutions will usually give you access to some date functions that boil down to actual SQL or whatever, in the case of nonSQL dbs. On the other hand, many of these abstractions dont provide direct access to SQL functions and you lose the ability to deal with dates directly. Instead, youre expected to use the upperlevel language PHP, Python, whatever to do your datewrangling, and finally only insert, select, whathaveyou the formatted date.p  pSo my question is this if the SQL server never gets to do anything with the date itself, am I better off just using an int and putting epoch timestamps in it, or is there additional value to the database server knowing its a datep

Negative 1292 pI am using emafreechartem and codeedu.emory.mathcs.jtransformscode and codeorg.afree.chartcode in numerous different activities I am writing for Android.  I have a tremendous amount of trouble getting each new project configured so that I can p  ol liSee the classes from the library as I write code in Eclipse IDE.li liSee attached source for these classesli liSee attached javadoc for these classesli liSee the .class files for these classes when I try to run my Activity.li ol  pWhat I do now is make a copy of the .jar, doc src and .properties for each library I use.  I copy those four things into the local lib folder for each project one per activity I am creating.  p  pI must be missing something simple.  It seems obvious that I should have these libraries, with their doc, src, and .properties, in one location, and that I should be able to reference that location in each project that uses those libraries.  But I havent figure out yet how to do that.  Please tell me how.    p  pIf there is a way to define a set of jars and associated src amp doc that will automatically and always be searched by any new eclipse project I do, that would be even better.p  pEDIT ADDED After answers about external Libsp  pSo indeed I did put jtransforms2.4.jar in an external directory.  In that same directory I put the src and doc for the package, and a file jtransforms2.4.properties with a doc and src entry pointing at the local files with doc and src.  I added them to my build path as external jar.  p  p1 Eclipse IDE certainly found the classes in the .jar and flagged nothing as missing. 2 The doc and the src were shown as not attached.  strongHow do I put doc and src info along with the library so they automatically show up every place I link the jar as an external jarstrong 3 When I attempted to run the app, I got NoClassDefFound errors for all the classes in the jar.  That is, Eclipse IDE could find these classes in the external lib, but they did not make it in to the class path of the app.  p  pSUMMARY so the external jar technique has failed in two out of three important respects 1 No src and doc show up as attached in eclipse IDE 2 do not provide updated class paths to the App.  p  pFINALLY when I copied the jar, .properties, doc and src in to the lib folder of my project, and removed the external jar reference, everything worked perfectly.  p  pSO I reiterate my original question, the answers given add to build path as external jar did not solve anything.  p

Negative 1292 pIm trying to crosscompile VLC from linux to windows with gnutls support which in turn uses libgmp.  I get linking errors for multiple definitions for symbols in libgmp gmpzabs, for example, among countless others.  I have in turn traced this back to libgnutls.a having multiple definitions of the same symbol, due to object files in emgnutlsem each having their own definitions of emgmpem functions.  The functions that are multiply defined are ones that libgmp is trying to do something tricky with inlining.p  pTheres a lot of variation with inlining between different compilers, standards, and platforms, from what I can tell.  It seems like libgmp is trying to use macros to handle this all properly but is failing.  The end result is inline functions defined in gmp.h are getting copied into every object file in gnutls that uses it.  Ive looked at the actual compiler command lines that mingw is called with to create these object files, and I cant see anything wrong with itp  precodelibtool compile  i686w64mingw32gcc stdgnu99 DHAVECONFIGH I.

I know why, because the String customer can only store one information. p  pemI have a feeling I need to change Customer to an Array.emp  pstrongplease bare in mind, I dont want to use an ArrayList.strong p  pstrongSO my question is, how do I go about solving this Because I tried to work with Customer as an array and I ruined the entire coding thankgod for local history revertstrongp  pCodep  precodepackage testroom  import java.util.  public class TestRoom      public static void mainString[] args           Scanner input  new ScannerSystem.in          String Customer  null         int roomNum  1         String Option          String[] hotel  new String[12]          initialisehotel           while  roomNum  lt 11                        System.out.printlnHotel Booking Options             System.out.printlnV To View all rooms             System.out.printlnA To Add customer to a room             System.out.printlnE To Display empty rooms             System.out.printlnD To Delete customer from a room             System.out.printlnF Find room from customer name             System.out.printlnO View rooms alphabetically by name              Option  input.next              if Option.equalsV viewing all rooms                 viewhotel, Customer                             if Option.equalsA  adding a customer to a room                  System.out.printlnEnter room number110                 roomNum input.nextInt                 System.out.printlnEnter name for room   roomNum                       Customer  input.next                 hotel[roomNum]  Customer                  addhotel, Customer                 System.out.println                             if Option.equalsE view all empty rooms                 vacanthotel, Customer links to private static void empty                           if Option.equalsD Deletes a customer from a room                  Searches if room is occupied, if it is then it will delete customer from that room                 viewhotel, Customer                 System.out.printlnEnter the room which you want to delete a customer from                  roomNum  input.nextInt                 hotel[roomNum]  empty                  deletehotel, Customer                 System.out.println                            if Option.equalsF view all empty rooms                 findhotel links to private static void empty                                  private static void initialise String hotelRef[]               for int x  1 x lt 11 x              hotelRef[x]  empty         System.out.println Welcome to The Plaza            public static void viewString hotel[], String Customer          for int x 1 x lt11 x                      int z0             String Customername  Customer             hotel[z] Customername              if hotel[x].equalsempty                 System.out.printlnroom   x   is empty             else                  System.out.printlnroom   x   is occupied by  hotel[z]                                 private static void addString hotel[], String Customer         for int x 1 x lt11 x                      int z0             String Customername  Customer             hotel[z] Customername             if hotel[x].equalsempty                 System.out.printlnroom   x   is empty             else                  System.out.printlnroom   x   is occupied by  hotel[z]                                  private static void vacantString hotel[], String Customer         for int x  1 x lt 11 x                       int z0             String Customername  Customer             hotel[z] Customername             if hotel[x].equalsempty if statement                 System.out.printlnroom   x   is empty                       private static void deleteString hotel[], String Customer link to this when pressed the D key         view hotel         for int x  1 x lt 11 x                       int z0             String Customername  Customer             hotel[z] Customername             if hotel[x].equalsempty                               System.out.printlnroom   x   is empty                          else                  System.out.printlnroom   x   occupied by   hotel[x]                                 private static void findString hotel[]          Scanner input  new ScannerSystem.in            System.out.printlnEnter customer name for room          String customersname         customersname  input.next  stores name they enter as customers name         for int x  0 x lt 10 x                       if hotel[x].equalscustomersname                 System.out.printlnroom   x   is occupied                       by hotel[x]                 codepre

Negative 1292 pI am creating an app that allows a user to build a custom 2D avatar by specifying things like shoes, socks, skin color, etc...p  pCurrently my solution has been to create a .PNG of each item and then to stack them all on top of each other in a RelativeLayout.  So for example, I create an ImageView of two shoes and align the ImageView to the center of the relative layout and the bottom of the Relative Layout.  Next I stack the bottom edge of the socks to the top edge of the shoe.  And on and on.  p  pThis method works, but I feel like I dont have much control over where the parts sit and would much rather be able to calculate the x,y coordinates at run time and place the images that way.  For instance, this works well if all of the ImageViews are stacked, but if I need to place one ImageView 10 pixels below the top edge of another ImageView I cant do it or at least I havent figured out how yet.  p  pstrongI am looking for a solution that will allow me to control the x,y position of ImageViews and allow ImageView to be offset from each other.strongp

Negative 1292 pI am calling a PHP script to get results, and then turning the array to a javascript array. My array is for a multiple choice quiz, there can be 2 to 6 answers, it pulls the question with the answer.p  pIve been doing alot of testing, and sometimes a record is missing when it is expected. For example, after pulling the next question which should have 5 answers, only 4 answers are pulled. Even if I reload the quiz, the same result is missing.p  pThis is seemingly random, there is no pattern as to when this problem occurs, for example, the first test found the first question which has six answers was missing an answer result. Another test found the third question which was a four answer question was missing an answer result.p  pI used the Javascript console, and the only pattern I could identify when one of these questions has a result missing, it is always the answerid which would be the first, ie if the answerids are 285, 286, 287, then 285 would be the missing one.p  pOut of 25 tested questions, only 3 have a result missing.p  pHere is my code, the PHP script...p  precodethisquizid  REQUEST[quizidvalue] questionquery  pgquerydbhandle, SELECT  FROM question LEFT JOIN answer USING questionid WHERE quizid  thisquizid questionrows  pgnumrowsquestionquery  questionresult  pgfetcharrayquestionquery   questions  array  whilerow  pgfetcharrayquestionquery      questions[row[questionid]][]  row  diejsonencodequestions codepre  pAnd my Javascriptp  precodevar questions var currentquestion  0   document.readyfunction          console.debugin ajax         jQuery.ajax                      error function data, textStatus, errorThrown                         console.logdata                         console.logtextStatus                         console.logerrorThrown                     ,                     urlquizajax.php,                     dataType json,                     data                           quizidvalue ltthisquizidgt                     ,               .donefunctiondata                      questions  data                     fori in data                         console.logdata[i]                                                  nextquestionbtn.clickfunction               nextQuestion                function nextQuestion      fori in questions          ifiltcurrentquestion             continue          currentquestion  i           fory in questions[i]              console.logCurrentA  currentquestion             console.logI   i             console.logquestions[i][y].answerid                    console.logCurrentQ  currentquestion         console.logI   i         console.logquestions[i]          questionVariables            break      codepre  pAnd here is a question with its records in my databasep  precodequestionid  quizid  questiontype  qdescription  qfilelocation  noofanswers  answertype  answerid  adescription  afilelocation  iscorrect           295      57  text          6mark work    null                     6  text             795  sadfds        null           t         295      57  text          6mark work    null                     6  text             796  asdfsd        null           f         295      57  text          6mark work    null                     6  text             797  asfsadf       null           f         295      57  text          6mark work    null                     6  text             798  asdfsadf      null           f         295      57  text          6mark work    null                     6  text             799  asdfsadf      null           f         295      57  text          6mark work    null                     6  text             800  sadfasdf      null           f codepre

Negative 1292 pIve been through many posts about stopping bound services, but most are just misunderstandings of the Android API, and none answers my question. I didnt find the answer on the Android Developers website either I might have missed something.p  pI have a service that can both be started and bound to. I know that calls to codestopServicecode wont stop my service if clients are still bound to it therefore codeonDestroycode will not be called.p  pHowever, I would like to do something in the service when codestopServicecode is called even if this does not stop it because its started behaviour is slightly different from its simple bound to behaviour.p  pI know that codeonStartCommandcode is called whenever codestartServicecode is called even if the service is already started, but codeonCreatecode is called only once when the service starts.p  pWhat I would like to have is a callback like codeonStopCommandcode, which would be called whenever codestopServicecode is called, even if codeonDestroycode is not called in the case of a stillbound service, but AFAIK this does not exist, does itp  pThe options I considered to solve my problem are the following, but I dont like either of themp  ol liSplit my service in 2 services 1 started, and 1 boundli liImplement a codestopcode method in my service that I should call everywhere just before codestopServicecode I could do that through the binder.li ol  pWhat do you think of these solutions Do you have any better ideap  pstrongEDIT Here is a more detailed description of the differences between started and bound to behaviours of my servicestrongp  pLets call my service S1. It contains a state that can be accessed from other activities and services by bounding to it. There is another service, S2, that can only be bound to.p  pWhen started through codestartServicecode, S1 binds to S2 to listen to events in S2 that can change the state in S1. p  pWhen stopped through codestopServicecode, I would like S1 to unbind from S2 and stop updating its state. For now I do it in codeonDestroycode.p  pMy problem is that if clients are bound to S1, S1 wont stop and so wont unbind from S2.p  pI hope it helps understanding my problem.p

Negative 1292 pI am implementing a custom emNSIncrementalStoreem subclass which uses a relational database for persistent storage. One of the things that I still struggle with is the support for optimistic locking. p  hr  pemstrongfeel free to skip this lengthy description right to my question belowemstrongp  pI analyzed how Core Datas SQLite incremental store approaches this problem by examining SQL logs produced by it and came up with following conclusionsp  ul lipEach entity table in the database has a strongZOPTstrong column which indicates the number of times a particular instance of this entity row has been modified, starting from 1 initial insertion.pli lipEach time a managed object is modified, strongZOPTstrong value in its corresponding database row is incremented.pli lipThe store maintains cache referred to as emrow cacheem in Core Data docs of emNSIncrementalStoreNodeem instances, each having a strongversionstrong property equal to strongZOPTstrong value returned by previous strongSELECTstrong or strongUPDATEstrong SQL query on managed objects row.pli lipWhen a managed object is returned from emNSManagedObjectContextem e.g. by executing emNSFetchRequestem on it, MOC creates snapshot of this object which contains this strongversionstrong number.pli lipWhen the object is modified or deleted, Core Data makes sure that it has not been modified or deleted outside the context by comparing versions of cached row and object snapshot. All of this happen when strongsavestrong is called on the context that the object belongs to. If the versions are different then a merge conflict is detected and handled based on set merging policy.pli ul  pWhen MOC is being saved, the strongnewValuesForObjectWithIDwithContexterrorstrong method is called  for each modifieddeleted object which in turn returns emNSIncrementalStoreNodeem with version number. This version is then compared to snapshots version and if they are different, the save fails with appropriate merge conflicts at least with default merge policy.p  pThis simple use case works properly with my store since strongnewValuesForObjectWithIDwithContexterrorstrong checks the row cache first which is enough if the object was concurrently modified in other context using the same store instance. If this is the case, then the cache contains updated row with higher version number which is enough to detect a conflict.p  pBut how can I detect than the underlying database has been modified outside my store, possibly by other application or other store instance using the same database file I know this is an unfrequent edge case but Core Data handles it properly and I would prefer to do the same.p  pCore Datas store uses SQL queries like these to updatedelete objects rowp  precodeUPDATE ZFOO SET ZOPTY, ... WHERE ... AND ZOPTX DELETE FROM ZFOO WHERE ... AND ZOPTX codepre  pwherebr strongXstrong  version number last known to the store from cachebr strongYstrong  new version number  p  pIf such a query fails no rows affected the row is updated in stores cache and its version compared against the one previously cached.p  hr  pstrongMy question isstrong how can a custom emNSIncrementalStoreem inform Core Data that optimistic locking failure has occurred for some updateddeletedlocked objects It is only the store that is able to tell that when it handles emNSSaveChangesRequestem passed to it its strongexecuteRequestwithContexterrorstrong method. p  pIf the underlying database does not change under the store, then conflicts are detected since Core Data calls strongnewValuesForObjectWithIDwithContexterrorstrong on each modifieddeletedlocked object prior to executing save changes request on the store. I was not able to find any way for emNSIncrementalStoreem to inform Core Data that an optimistic locking failure has occurred strongafterstrong it started to handle the save request. Is there some undocumented way to do that Core Data seems to throw emsomeem exception in that case which is then magically translated into failed save request with NSError listing all the conflicts. I am only able to mimic that partly by returning nil from strongexecuteRequestwithContexterrorstrong and creating the error message by myself. I think there must be a way to use the standard Core Data conflict handling mechanism in this scenario as well.p

Negative 1292 pI am rewriting a console application and trying to use Unit Tests. Im using NUnit, C, .NET Framework 4 in Visual Studio 2010 on a Windows 7 PC.p  pWhen I change code within the application my unit tests dont pick up the latest changes. I can see that NUnit is reloading but for some reason its not getting the latest version. The only way to get NUnit to work with the latest version is to remove the reference to the Console app, add it back and compile.p  pIs there a way to avoid doing this I think the problem is that the the console app is compiled as an EXE, whereas with most applications Ive unittested they have tended to be DLLs.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI had hoped that this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10423267unittestingaconsoleapplicationinsidevisualstudioUnit Testing a Console Application inside Visual Studioa contained the answer. If you look at the accepted answer this was the way Id been proceeding but my test project wasnt picking up the changes. Ive now created a class library and Im applying my tests to that. My console app will simply load, then call, this class library.p  pstrongSecond Editstrongp  pIve now got my code to a stage where I can test functionality and Ive noticed the same problem with my console app. Although it says it is referencing the compiled DLL, it only picks up the latest change when I delete and reattach the reference. So, Im thinking that the problem isnt necessarily connected to NUnit, rather an issuequirk with console apps.p

Negative 1292 pI am trying to set up a program that can generate balance sheets based on summing a number of transactions, and present the results in a format like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comM3tbE.jpg altbalance sheet The important attributes here are that the toplevel account e.g. Assets is decomposed into a tree of subaccounts, and only the lowestlevel accounts leaves track their own balances the balances of higherlevel accounts are just the sums of the balances of their subaccounts.p  pMy goto approach is to use inheritancep  precodeclass Account    string name    virtual int getBalance 0 generic base class has no implementation    virtual void addToBalanceint amount 0  class ParentAccount  public Account    vectorltAccountgt children    virtual int getBalance        int result  0       for int i  0 i lt children.size i           result  children[i]gtgetBalance       return result        virtual void addToBalanceint amount        cout ltlt Error Cannot modify balance of a parent account ltlt endl       exit1      class ChildAccount  public Account    int balance    virtual int getBalance  return balance     virtual void addToBalanceint amount balance  amount  codepre  pThe idea is that which accounts are present is not known at compile time, so the tree account must be generated dynamically.  Inheritance is helpful here because it makes it easy to generate an arbitrarily deep tree structure ParentAccounts can have children which are ParentAccounts, and because it makes it easy to implement functions like codegetBalancecode using recursion.  p  pThings get a bit awkward when I attempt to incorporate the features which are unique to the derived classes, such as modifying the balance which should only be possible for codeChildAccountcode objects, as codeParentAccountcode balances are just defined by the balances of their children.  My plan is that a function like codeprocessTransactionstring accountName, int amountcode would search through the tree structure looking for an account with the correct name, then call codeaddToBalanceamountcode on that account note below.  Since the tree structure above would only allow me to find an codeAccountcode, it would either be necessary to implement codeaddToBalanceamountcode for all classes, as I did above, or to codedynamiccastcode the codeAccountcode to a codeChildAccountcode before calling codeaddToBalancecode.  The first option seems slightly more elegant, but the fact that it requires me to define codeParentAccountaddToBalancecode albeit as an error seems kind of weird to me.p  pMy question is Is there a name for this awkwardness, and a standard approach for resolving it, or am I just totally misapplying inheritance  p  pstrongNotestrong I recognize there is probably a more efficient way of organizing the accounts for searching, but my primary objective is to create a program which is intuitive to interpret and debug.  Based on my current level of understanding, this comes at the price of computational efficiency in this case at least.p

Negative 1292 pIm trying to build a smart package for Meteor app that provides some monitoring capabilities and other tools based on the features of the smart package. For more details read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq17356615586086this questiona.p  pIn any case, Im trying to figure out the best way to create an admin interface for this package, which will of course be itself running in Meteor. Ideally, Id like something similar to a hrefhttpobservatoryjs.comobservatorya, except on a separate part of the site that the package can control or even on a different port. p  pThe way the observatory folks have tackled this problem is pretty ingenious  they just have a popup div on the main app page that provides the necessary information. Thats fine, but not the optimal way for revealing the interface on an app, in my opinion. The problem with using routes is that the popular a hrefhttpsgithub.comtmeasdaymeteorrouterMeteor routera that everyone uses a hrefhttpsgithub.comtmeasdaymeteorrouterissues101doesnt support more than one stack of pagesa, and better Meteor routers that have been developed such as by Chris Mather in a hrefhttpwww.meetup.comMeteorSFBayevents122224422Devshop 5a havent been released yet. p  pCan anyone suggest a good approach to tackle this problem Ideally my package would just be able to render its own admin templates on a separate part of the site such as codeadmincode.p

Negative 1292 pMy frustration is that there is no solid structure there. Here is the example.p  pLet say i wanted to find something similar to below though i didnt even know where should i look for it. I would think it would be like element.create... or something. p  pstrongcreateAttributestrongp  pI would goto MDN site, hover at Docs nav and then click Reference. As normal people would do.. Out of all 4 possible options which i am presented afterwards i only find web api to be most related. p  pAfter guessing and checking out couples of things in the huge list. I finally give up and search for it straight. p  pAnd what you know its not there at all. In fact, the correct path to get here would have been..p  phover at docs click strongmore docsstrongmeaning something not as core and useful click DOM click DOM reference.p  pNow i ask Shouldnt this be in Web APi  reference Or at LEAST shouldnt this be in Reference section.p  pIts not the things i know i am worried about, its the things that i want to discover. I dont remember all the methods and properties or even that such apiobject even exist. So i need a solid way to explore. Whereas, MDN is fragmented, always in a wiki stage, unorganized, and when you do find stuff it is presented in very bad way. list of properties should be at left and definitions at right NOT underwaste time scrolling. Better than w3 though..p  pFor these reasons if i need a strongreferencestrong i just go to w3schools, they may not have complete list of all attributesargumentsusage hints but have all most used apifunctions. In very very organized way. Nothing is away than 2 or three clicks and sortingreading is way easier. p  pcheck this out a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comjsrefdomobjdocument.asp relnofollowhttpwww.w3schools.comjsrefdomobjdocument.aspap  pBut even though exploration is efficient and easy there. Its not complete.

Negative 1292 pA lot of programming languages have statements terminated by lineendings.  Usually, though, line endings are allowed in the middle of a statement if the parser cant make sense of the line for example, p  precodea  3  4 codepre  p...will be parsed in Ruby and Python as the statement codea  34code, since codea  3code doesnt make any sense.  In other words, the newline is ignored since it leads to a parsing error.p  pMy question is  how can I simplyelegantly accomplish that same behavior with a tokenizer and parser  Im using Lemon as a parser generator, if it makes any difference though Im also tagging this question as yacc since Im sure the solution applies equally to both programs.p  pHeres how Im doing it now  allow a statement terminator to occur optionally in any case where there wouldnt be syntactic ambiguity.  In other words, something likep  precodeexpression  identifier PLUS identifier statementterminator. expression  identifier PLUS statementterminator identifier statementterminator. codepre  p... in other words, its ok to use a newline after the plus because that wont have any effect on the ambiguity of the grammar.  My worry is that this would balloon the size of the grammar and I have a lot of opportunities to miss cases or introduce subtle bugs in the grammar.  Is there an easier way to do this  p  pEDIT  Actually, that code example wont work for Python.  Python does in fact ignore the newline if you pass in something like this, thoughp  precodeprint 1, 2, 3 codepre

Negative 1292 pI am confused as to what ANSI specification says about changing a variable declared codeconstcode can be legally modified through its address. Unfortunately I do not have access to C90 specification but got conflicting pointersp  ol lipThe keyword const doesnt turn a variable into a constant A symbol with the const qualifier merely means that the symbol cannot be used for assignment. This makes the value re ad onl y through that symbol it does not prevent the value from being modified through some other means internal or even external to the program. It is pretty much useful only for qualifying a pointer parameter, to indicate that this function will not change the data that argument points to, but other functions may. Expert C Programming Deep C Secrets Peter van der Lindenpli lipIf an attempt is made to modify an object defined with a constqualified type through use of an lvalue with nonconstqualified type, the behavior is undefined.  If an attempt is made to refer to an object defined with a volatilequalified type through use of an lvalue with nonvolatilequalified type, the behavior is undefined. a hrefhttpflashgordon.me.ukansi.c.txt relnofollowhttpflashgordon.me.ukansi.c.txtapli ol  pI have seen the latter in C99 specification n1256.pdf.p  pCan anyone clarify as to which of the above two views is true pleasep  pEdit The Expect C Programming actually gives an example to demonstrate the ability to change a codeconstcode variable using pointer.p

On the first time through it has to open a WebSocket to the C. On subsequent loads in the same tab     I want it to recognize that the WebSocket connection exists and continue using it.      I tried to create a window.myApi object to save data, but each page seems to get a new window object.      I was going to try to use local storage but that is shared between all local instances of all the scripts     and a fresh instance of the content script does not know whether it is running for first time or not.      By the way, when my content script opens a WebSocket to the C, the C responds with a unique id GUID so     all further communications use this unique id in the messages.      It would be great if a content script can tell if it has been assigned a unique id by the C program.

Negative 1292 pI inherited an old project that uses an Innovasic ia188em processor previously AM188 from AMD. I will likely need to modify the code, and so will need to recompile. Unfortunately, Im not sure which compiler was used previously it compiled into a .hex file, and searching through the source code and in particular the header files doesnt seem to indicate it either. p  pI did see one program that could work, but I was wondering if anyone knew of any free programs that might do this. I saw some forums where people said they thought either an old Borland compiler or Bruces C Compiler may work with 80188 chips which I assume my chip falls under, but nothing concrete. I failed to compile with Borland C 5 when I tried, though I admit I probably didnt have it set up correctly.p  pThis is for an embedded board i.e. no OS. I dont program too often, so my compiler knowledge is limited. I mostly just write simple C programs and compile with gcc under linux. Any help is appreciated.p  pstrongUpdated 108 I apologize, I was looking at both this code, and the PC side code that talks to the embedded board, and got mixed up. The code for the ia188em embedded board is actually C not C. Updated title to reflect that. Im not sure if it makes a huge difference or not.strongp

The slow tests still run. When maven constructs the effective codepom.xmlcode file, it applies the codeskipSlowTestscode profile and configures codemavensurefireplugincode to exclude the groups codeSlowTest.classcode. Then the codeskipWindowsTestscode profile is applied and this overwrites the excluded groups to be codeWindowsTest.classcode.p  pWhat I really want is the excluded groups to be codeSlowTest.class,WindowsTest.classcode when both profiles are activated, but I cannot figure out a way to do this. p  pTheres no way that I can see in maven of appending a value to a property, e.g.p  precodeltpropertiesgt   ltexcludedGroupsgtIgnoreTest.classltexcludedGroupsgt ltpropertiesgt  ltplugingt   ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt   ltartifactIdgtmavensurefirepluginltartifactIdgt   ltconfigurationgt     ltexcludedGroupsgtexcludedGroupsltexcludedGroupsgt   ltconfigurationgt ltplugingt  ltprofilegt   ltidgtskipSlowTestsltidgt   ltpropertygt     ltexcludedGroupsgtexcludedGroups,SlowTest.classltexcludedGroupsgt   ltpropertygt   ... ltprofilegt  ltprofilegt   ltigtskipWindowsTestsltidgt   ltpropertygt     ltexcludedGroupsgtexcludedGroups,WindowsTest.classltexcludedGroupsgt   ltpropertygt   ... ltprofilegt codepre  pThis codepom.xmlcode is broken, because theres recursion in assigning a value to the codeexcludedGroupscode property.p  pAnd theres no way to set up a third profile e.g. codeskipSlowTestsAndWindowsTestscode that activates whenever both the codeskipSlowTestscode and codeskipWindowsTestscode are activated.p  pAny suggestions here Maybe adding separate phases to codemavensurefireplugincode one for slow tests, one for windows tests, one for all others and using profiles to determine which phases runp  pstrongEdit 1strong p  pI tried creating separate execution phases for the codemavensurefireplugincode as followsp  precodelt By default, do not skip slow tests or windows tests gt ltpropertiesgt   ltskipSlowTestsgtfalseltskipSlowTestsgt   ltskipWindowsTestsgtfalseltskipWindowsTestsgt ltpropertiesgt  ltplugingt   ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt   ltartifactIdgtmavensurefirepluginltartifactIdgt   ltexecutionsgt     lt Default execution will skip SlowTest and WindowsTest categories gt     ltexecutiongt       ltidgtdefaulttestltidgt       ltphasegttestltphasegt       ltgoalsgt         ltgoalgttestltgoalgt       ltgoalsgt       ltconfigurationgt         ltexcludedGroupsgtSlowTest,WindowsTestltexcludedGroupsgt       ltconfigurationgt     ltexecutiongt     lt Slow Test execution will run the slow tests only if not skipped gt     ltexecutiongt       ltidgtslowtestltidgt       ltphasegttestltphasegt       ltgoalsgt         ltgoalgttestltgoalgt       ltgoalsgt       ltconfigurationgt         ltskipgtskipSlowTestsltskipgt         ltgroupsgtSlowTestltgroupsgt       ltconfigurationgt     ltexecutiongt     lt Windows Test execution will run the windows tests only if not skipped gt     ltexecutiongt       ltidgtwindowstestltidgt       ltphasegttestltphasegt       ltgoalsgt         ltgoalgttestltgoalgt       ltgoalsgt       ltconfigurationgt         ltskipgtskipWindowsTestsltskipgt         ltgroupsgtWindowsTestltgroupsgt       ltconfigurationgt     ltexecutiongt   ltexecutionsgt ltplugingt  ltprofilesgt   lt Skip slow tests when skipSlowTests profile enabled gt   ltprofilegt     ltidgtskipSlowTestsltidgt     ltpropertiesgt       ltskipSlowTestsgttrueltskipSlowTestsgt     ltpropertiesgt   ltprofilegt   lt Skip windows tests when skipWindowsTests profile enabled gt   ltprofilegt     ltidgtskipWindowsTestsltidgt     ltpropertiesgt       ltskipWindowsTestsgttrueltskipWindowsTestsgt     ltpropertiesgt     ...   ltprofilegt ltprofilesgt codepre  pThis configuration will run tests in three separate executions the codedefaulttestcode execution will run every test except for slow tests and windows tests the codeslowtestcode execution will run the slow tests only and the codewindowstestcode execution will run the windows tests only.

Similarly, this test case will also be executed when the codeskipWindowsTestscode profile only is enabled. The only way to skip this test case is to specify both the codeskipSlowTestscode and codeskipWindowsTestscode profiles.p  pI tried modifying the executions as followsp  precode    ltexecutiongt       ltidgtslowtestltidgt         ...          ltgroupsgtSlowTestltgroupsgt         ltexcludedGroupsgtWindowsTestltexcludedGroupsgt         ...     ltexecutiongt     ltexecutiongt       ltidgtwindowstestltidgt         ...          ltgroupsgtWindowsTestltgroupsgt         ltexcludedGroupsgtSlowTestltexcludedGroupsgt         ...     ltexecutiongt codepre  pBut now the codeslowWindowsTestCasecode method is never executed.p  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pAnd even if I could get the test executions working correctly, I would need to add a dependency on codemavensurefireplugincode so that the codeSlowTestcode and codeWindowsTestcode interfaces can be loaded during testing. I have put codemavensurefireplugincode in the codepluginManagementcode section of my parent POM, but any dependency defined for this plugin cannot have codetestcode scope. As a result, running a test outside of the module that defines the codeSlowTestcode and codeWindowsTestcode interfaces will not work. I can add a codetestcode scope dependency for the plugin in the profiles, but that will not cover the case when no profiles are active.p

Negative 1292 pWere working on a project using OpenCV 2.4.6 and Qt 5.1.1 in C. We have to load images for image processing at several points in our code, which we did using cvimread, as normal. However, we wanted to make software compatible with other language filesystems, and found that having file paths with foreign characters would fail to load. p  pThe problem, we believe, has to do with the fact that imread can only take in a stdstring or char, and casting a path with non Latin1 symbols to a stdstring results in characters that use multiple bytes in UTF8 the encoding used for QString, which is how we store the paths being converted to multiple chars. p  pTo confirm that the file paths are valid, weve opened them by passing a wstring to a regular ifstream, which successfully opens the file and reads bits. Our current hack is to load the image as a QImage and then copy the data to a cvMat, but this isnt a satisfying solution, for multiple reasons, chiefly that as we understand it, QtQImage loads images in 8bit format, and our images are of a higher bit depth. p  pIs there any clean way to get around this I saw a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13375076imreadopencvqstringunicodesthisa questions, but toAscii is deprecated, and its replacements didnt work for us. Weve tried the following ways of converting the QString to a stdstring and passing them to imread.p  pQStringtoStdString, QStringtoUtf8.data, QStringtoLocal8Bit.data, QStringtoLatin1.data. They all appear to yield roughly the same results. p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1292 pI am just getting started with AWS and EC2 and cant quite get my head wrapped around what to do with email.p  pOn previous servers, I would use it as a mail server and on cPanel create all the email accounts I needed, and could access them trough web mail.p  pI cant get a consistent answer on how to set up email accounts on a domain that is pointing to an EC2 instance.p  pMy question is, how can you set up email accounts for a domain pointed at EC2 instance, and if its not possible is there a way to set up emails on a third party like gmail with the domain pointed at EC2p  pJust so you know the domain is managed at GoDaddy.p  pThanksp

Negative 1292 pI am trying to use a genetic algorithm with DEAP to solve an optimization problem not all that different from a knapsack problem. A chromosome is represented by a vector of integers and the constraint is that the sum of the vector must be equal to some number X. It seems inefficient to deal with this in the fitness evaluation as there are relatively few crossoversmutations that will lead to having a vector with sum exactly equal to X. p  pInstead it seems like I should be remapping crossovers and mutations to be within the bounded set of possible solutions.

What we wish to implement is a production repository where ONLY the versions of code that have been put into live are stored.

There would have to be a number of variable declaration statements in front of that expression to make sure the variables we want to expose to the user for his expression. p  pSo the user would be presented with a text field, he would enterp  precodex1  3.5x2  x3 codepre  pand we would do our interpreting process to come up with an open delegate object. We then punch the values into this object from a map, and call execute, to get the result of the expression. p  pAny objections to using Jython, or should I be doing something other than modifying source code I would like to think that some kind of mutable object akin to Cs Expression object, where we could do something likep  precodePythonExpression expr  new PythonExpressionuserSuppliedText expr.setDefaultNamespace expr.loadLibrariesnumPy, other libraries  comes from somewhere else in the flow, but effectively we get MapltString, Doublegt symbolValuesByName  new HashMapltgt     putx1, 3.0     putx2, 20.0     putx3, 2.0   expr.loadSymbolssymbolValuesByName  Runnable exprDelegate  expr.compile  sometime later exprDelegate.run codepre  pbut, Im hoping for a lot, and it looks like Jython is as good as it gets. Still, modifying source files and then passing them to an interpreter seems really heavyhanded.p  pDoes that sound like a good approach Do you guys have any other libraries youd suggestp  hr  h2Update NumPy does not work with Jythonh2  pI shouldve discovered this one on my own.p  pSo now my question shifts Is there any way that from a single JVM process instance meaning, without ever having to fork I can compile and run some Python codep

Negative 1292 pI am working on a site with many forms . Most of the forms will be submitted via jquery AJAX.p  pI have implemented recaptcha for security but the client does not like it as the words are sometimes difficult to read.p  pAs an alternate I am looking at honeytrap method for less important forms. As I understand In this method I keep a field in the form hidden from normal users via CSS. So legitimate users will leave the field blank while a bot will fill it .p  pNow my question is since I am using jQuery AJAX for form submission, instead of hidden field if form , cant I just pass an extra variable along with form field variables from javascript to AJAX. like var secretword  1 AJAX will check this variable if secretword  1   and if it is emptybot will not use javascript to sumbit form so var will be empty then the form will not be submitted.For legitimate users javascript function will add 1 value to the variable.Is my method as secure as honeytrapp  pNOTE Website does not work without javascript so need not go into what happens if javascript is disabled.p  pPlease provide me your valuable advice on this.p

Negative 1292 pFrom what I have read, to determine network speed I need to download an image from the web with known file size, and then determine the time that this process took to get my variables for my Mbps calculation. My first question is, how would I download an image to Windows Phone using javascript I am somewhat familiar with javascript functions now that I have been researching, but I am not sure how to tell the function where to save the image. Also, my guess is that I will use the Navigation API new to HTML5 to determine the time the download process takes. For this, which metrics should I use from the codewindow.performance.timingcode to get this calculation. Currently I have a function made for each metric which I can return, but I am unsure of which to use in this calculation.p

But now how do you get the value of foo.Descp  pI tried the following which doesnt workp  precodegoo g  new goo PropertyInfo pInfo  g.GetType.GetPropertyf PropertyInfo pInfo2  pInfo.PropertyType.GetPropertyDesc string Name  stringpInfo2.GetValuepInfo.PropertyType, null codepre  pUnfortunately I get a Mismatched object error which I can understand because I am trying to use the property type and not the actual instance of the foo class.  I also tried to fins a way to instantiate an object from the propertyinfo but if there is a way then it eludes me.  I could do something like thisp  precodegoo g  new goo PropertyInfo propInfo  g.GetType.GetPropertyf object tmp  propInfo.SetValueg, Convert.ChangeTypenew foo, propInfo.PropertyType, null tmp  g.f codepre  pThis works but besides having to hard code the class, that is creating a new instance and therefore of now use to me.p  pAs I say I have been up and down looking for a solution.  Everything I have found is basically variants on the get a value of a property of a class theme but nothing about going another level deeper.p  pCan anyone help  Is this even possible because I would really like to stay away from hard coding.p  pEDIT I have edited the class to more accurately represent what I am working with.  Based on the comments below, I am getting the names of the foo instances from a database and that is why I am using Reflection or want to use Reflection instead of hard coding 30 switch statements.p  pEDIT Also I dont know before runtime which foo classes will be populated with data.  Also each foo class is different.  Unlike my example where each foo class has a string property, in my project each class has a different design which mirrors the database.p  pEDIT  So Ulugbek Umirov gave the answer.

However, I cant seem to figure out how to use it. According to this a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7apijavaxvalidationConstraintValidatorContext.htmlbuildConstraintViolationWithTemplate28java.lang.String29 relnofollowdocumentiona for the version Im using, I can add bean and property nodes to the violation. These are the only additional details I can specify to the violation definition, but I dont understand how they might map to parameters in the error message.p  pstrongMillion dollar question how can I pass dynamic parameters to my validation error messages using a custom validatorstrong I would like to fill in those codevaluecode and codereasoncode fields using the codeConstraintValidatorContextcodes interface for building violations.p  pObtaining an instance of the message source and interpolating the message within the custom validator is not an option  the messages coming out of validation get interpolated no matter what, and interpolating internally will result in some messages being interpolated twice, potentially annihilating escaped single quotes or other characters with special meanings in my message definitions file.p

Negative 1292 pI need to sort cubic bezier splines around a point by their outgoing tangent. My first attempt was to determine the outgoing tangent angle and sort by that. For a spline with four points codep0, p1, p2, p3code, the outgoing tangent angle isp  precodep0  p1  anglep0, p1  p0  p2  anglep0, p2  anglep0, p3 codepre  pThis handles degenerate a cubic that is actually a quadratic or even a line. However, the point may have two outgoing splines with the same tangent angle but a different control point or end point position later on down the spline that impacts the sorting order.p  pIs there a nice closedform algorithm for sorting two arbitrary bezier splines by outgoing angle that handles degenerate cases and also uses the rest of the spline to disambiguate cases when the tangents are equal I can do it by trying codetcode values until I disambiguate but it seems like there could be a closedform algorithm.p

Negative 1292 pI recently started using Python and Ive been working on an Open CV based project for over a month now.p  pI am using Simple Thresholding to detect a coloured blob and I have thresholded the HSV values to detect the blob. All works well, but when the blob goes out of the FOV of the camera, the program gets stuck. I was wondering if there could be a whileif condition that I can add at the top of the loop in order to skip the whole loop in case the blob goes outside FOV of the camera and then enter the loop when the blob returns.p  pWould really appreciate your help on this one Cheers.p

Negative 1292 pIm having problem making a empermanentem calibration in my embedded solution. Im developing a Qtbased app for a Embedded Linux environment with touch screen. For this last part, I use codetslibcode configured by previous developers.p  pIn what comes to simply calibrate the touch screen, everything is fine tscalibrate runs and creates the codepointercalcode file correctly. If after calling tscalibrate I run my Qt app or tstest, I can notice that the calibration is successful.p  pThe problem is that the calibration results only works for 1 opening of my app I calibrate with tscalibrate, run my app, close it and if I run my app again, the screen is one again noncalibrated.p  pNow obviously I dont want to have to call the calibration each time my app is closed and reopened. The question is stronghow to make the calibration results become permanentstrong that is, till another calibration is madep  hr  pstrongExtra infostrongp  pI did some research on the web and I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4503223reloadtslibtouchscreencalibrationthis SO threada telling about a way to handle this problem using codeQWSServercode. At first I disliked this solution since it depends on the Qt framework to do the job I was expecting a more general, C solution or a call to a script, whatever. But I implemented it and it worked  but only in a specific case, namely, if I calibrate, open my software, close it and reopen it, then the calibration is maintained. But the problem nevertheless persists if I shut down the hardware completely, turn it on and run my app without a call to tscalibrate reloading the Linux kernel in the process so this show to be only a partial solution and, therefore, not acceptable.p  pTrying to find the source of the problem, I created a copy of the codepointercalcode file just after calibration and another copy of it after shutting down and turning up my hardware and confirming that the calibration was over and I noticed that the file was changed in the middle despite no call to the tscalibrate or similar app was madep  pAfter calibration 55438 118 1920736 543 36058 34531168 65536 800 480p  pAfter hardware shutdown 55040 1280 2526720 288 35040 34398240 62768p  pThe terminal log for the linux boot codetftp bootmcode command dont mention codepointercalcode or a relevant calibration process.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI recently learned that the codepointercalcode file located inside codeetccode is changing between sections because that entire folder is made new when the hardware is restarted. So what is essentially happening is that Tslib is going after a file that is constantly reset to default each time the hardware is restarted, and what I need to do is to configure Tslib not to look there, but to a more secure folder in my case, the SD Card. The new question now is how to do that I know I have to configure the codetslib.shcode file making the codeTSLIBCALIBFILEcode variable point to the new location of codepointerscalcode, but codetslib.shcodeis itself inside codeetccode, being itself temporary.p
Negative 1292 pI would like to create something like an admin subapplication that is available on every page of my existing ember 1.6.x app. It will have its own statemachine router allowing it to load different controllerstemplates depending on its own state. I have seen a lot of similar discussions that revolve around having multiple state machines routers or extensive use of subroutes but nothing really hits the nail on the head. p  pIs there a clear way to create what is in effect two ember apps on the same page p  pThe subapp does not need to actually have routes that are interpreted in the url bar. It also does not need to have its state maintained when the parent app changes routesstates. It can be reset every time the parent app changes to a different route. What I want to avoid is repeating the same code over and over again inside multiple controllers in the parent app. I would also like to avoid polluting the application or global levels. p  pBelow is a list of discussions that I have looked into. The closest thing that I can find that makes sense is the work on ember flows which has not been finished yet. Or should I literally be looking into creating a new statemachine via the emberstates plugin for the subapp p  pTo be clear I am not looking for someone to write the code for me.

Negative 1292 pI am using JDK 1.6 and Spring 3.1.3 to create a RESTful service that accepts an object as JSON which gets converted into a Java object by Spring that I have specified in my service method.

With a regular image I could use imreadmyImage.jpg, ..., but in this case I cannot even load the database image in the data attribute of Mat because it is jpeg and not bmp.p  pAny idea  Is there some opencv method I could use that could understand directly the binary data and convert it to the appropriate structure  the imdecode functions seems to be used for bitmap datas.p  pedit  Berak, using a vector the imdecode function returns null Matrice What happens If the buffer is too short or contains invalid data, the empty matriximage is returned.

Now after I create a picture and a page which has the id of a picture in the headlineimageid attribute, I can fetch that headlineimage with emtargetpage.headlineimageem.

Negative 1292 pI am writing a python based monitoring agent and a php based service that aggregates all of the agents data.. I want to be able to securely validate that the server is authorized to talk to the agent.p  pMy thoughts were to exchange SSL certificates between the agent and the server and do some sort of validation with the publicprivate keys. Much like puppet doesdid with agents and puppetmaster.p  pThe agent runs a small python web service on port 8089, and accepts connections from a whitelisted hostname srv01. This web service receives commands and does various stuff on the client system in which the agent runs on.p  pWhat would be the best way to authenticate and authorize this cross communication from serveragent8089. Initially I was going to generate a unique sha256 hash and store it both on the agent and server and just do a comparison of this. Is this acceptable, or is there something else I should be looking intop  pI would assume a basic flow of getting this process to work would be..p  ol ligenerate a keypair on the serverli licopy the private key to the agent via ssh or scpli liserver communicates to the agent via http port 8089, passing along its public keyli liagent validates the public key against the private keyli liif the validation is successful, the agent goes and does stuff.li ol  pas an FYI, These servers are firewalled off from the rest of the world in an enterprise environment.p

Negative 1292 pIm trying to do the below tutorial question.p  precode Create a method called greatestCommonFactor  It should return the greatest common factor  between two numbers.     Examples of greatestCommonFactor    greatestCommonFactor6, 4    returns 2    greatestCommonFactor7, 9    returns 1    greatestCommonFactor20, 30  returns 10   Hint start a counter from 1 and try to divide both  numbers by the counter. If the remainder of both divisions  is 0, then the counter is a common factor. Continue incrementing  the counter to find the greatest common factor. Use a while loop  to increment the counter. codepre  pAnd my code is belowp  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList import java.util.Collections import java.util.List  public class Ex4GreatestCommonFactor        This is the main method that is executed as      soon as the program starts.       public static void mainString[] args           Call the greatestCommonFactor method a few times and print the results           public static int greatestCommonFactorint a, int b         int i  1          while i gt 1              i                  if ai  0 ampamp bi  0             ArrayList factor  new ArrayListltIntegergt             factor.addi                    else if ai lt 1  bi lt 1             Collections.sortfactor             ListltIntegergt topnum  factor.subListfactor.size  1, factor.size                   return topnum       codepre  pSo I have 2 questions. p  p1 In my elseif statement, I get an error where codefactorcode cannot be resolved to a variable.

I thought of making a row class, with row.text and row.deleteButton properties, and at each creation of a row, respective events will be created for button clicks and text edits.p  pIs there anyway to do this, ie a function that can be created that creates new objects by passing the required namep

Negative 1292 pIn c, if memory address of a variable is displayed as 0XFFF, for instance, I am not sure if its 2047 or 4095including the sign bit. 0xFFF is 1111 1111 1111 in binary. And I have recently learned about the sign bit, which just indicates if the number is positive or negative. My another guess is that it would be 0000 0000 0001 after converting into 2s complement positive number. So my question is this does memory address of 0XFFF indicate that its 4095 or 2047 or, perhaps, is it 1p

Negative 1292 pI am building a chat application in Java where there is one server and multiple chat clients connect to it so two clients can chat with each other. There is one thread with one socket connection per client. I am also implementing a way for the users to send files while sending chat messages. This is done by creating another thread with another socket. Or in other words, if client A wants to send a file to client B, then client A and the server will open a new socket connection on top of the one to send chat messages and the file will be sent to the client. Then, the socket will close and the server will open another socket to send the file to client B.p  pHowever, I seem to get a very strange error message shown below. I researched about the StreamCorruptedException and it seems to be about conflicting sockets and I thought the message passing socket and the file passing socket were interfering with each other.

Negative 1292 pI have done various searches and have yet to find a forum or article that discusses how to approach building a modeling computer for use with NetLogo.

Clearly, the capability of computers to run large NetLogo worlds is becoming increasingly important.p  pPresumably, the best solution for researchers at universities with access to Windowsbased machines would be to run 16GB to 64GB of RAM with a six or eightcore processor such as the Intel Xeon capable of hyperthreading for running multiple simulations in parallel with BehaviorSpace. As an example, I used SELES Fall amp Fall 2001 on a machine with a 6core Xeon processor with hyperthreading enabled and 8GB of RAM to run 12,000 replicates of a model with a 1meter resolution raster map of 1580x1580. This used the computer to its full capacity and it took about a month to run the simulations.p  pSo  if I were to run 12,000 replicates of a 12,000x12,000 world in NetLogo, what would be the best option for a computer Without reaching for the latest and greatest processing power out there, I would presume the most fiscallyreasonable option to be a server board with dual Xeon processors likely 8core Ivy bridge with 64GB of RAM. Would this be a sufficient design, or are there alternatives that are cheaper or not for modeling at this scale And additionally, do there exist guidelines of processorRAM combinations to cope with the increasing demand of NetLogo on memory as the size of worlds and the number of parallel simulations increasep

Negative 1292 pI cant come up with a solution to a problem Ive had when trying to create my own codedata.framecode and run a quantitative analysis such as a codechisq.testcode on it. p  pThe backdrop is as follows Ive summarized data I received relating to two hospitals. Both measured the same categorical variable n number of times. In this case its how frequently healthcare associated bacteria were found during a specific observation period. p  pIn a table, the summarized data looks as follows, where  indicates the percentage of all measurements made during the time period.p  precode                                    n Hospital 1       n Hospital 2  Healthcare associated bacteria          829 59.4            578 57.6 Community associated bacteria           473 33.9            372 37.1 Contaminants                             94 6.7              53 5.3 Total                                  1396 100.0          1003 100.0 codepre  pNow looking at the percentages, its evident that the proportions are very similar and you may wonder why on earth I want to statistically compare the two hospitals. But I have other data, where the proportions are different and so the aims of this question is p  pHow to compare Hospital 1 to Hospital 2 with regards to the categories measured. p  pAs the data is provided in a summarized fashion and in an array format, I decided to make a codedata.framecode for each of the single variablescategories. p  precodehosp1 lt repcYes, No, timesc829,567 hosp2 lt repcYes, No, timesc578,425 all lt cbindhosp1, chosp2,repNA, lengthhosp1lengthhosp2 all lt data.frameall namesall[2]lthosp2 summaryall codepre  pSo far so good, because the summary seems to look right to be able to now run a codechisq.testcode. But now, things get weird. p  precodewithall, chisq.testhosp1, hosp2, correctF      Pearsons Chisquared test  data  hosp1 and hosp2 Xsquared  286.3087, df  1, pvalue lt 2.2e16 codepre  pThe results, seem to indicate that theres a significant difference. If you crosstabulate the data, you see that R is summarizing it in a very strange way p  precodewithall, tablehosp1, hosp2         No Yes   No  174   0   Yes 251 578 codepre  pSo of course if the data is summarized in that way, therell be a statistically significant finding  because one category is summarized as having no measurments at all. Why on earth is this happening and what can I do to correct it Finally, instead of having to make a separate codedata.framecode for each category, is there anyway evident function to loop it I cant come up with one. p  pThanks for your helpp  pstrongUPDATED BASED ON THELATEMAILS REQUEST FOR RAW DATA.FRAMEstrongp  precodedputSOExamplev1 structurelistType  structurec3L, 1L, 2L, .Label  cCommunity,  Contaminant, Healthcare, class  factor, hosp1WoundAssocType  c464L,  285L, 24L, hosp1BloodAssocType  c73L, 40L, 26L, hosp1UrineAssocType  c75L,  37L, 18L, hosp1RespAssocType  c137L, 77L, 2L, hosp1CathAssocType  c80L,  34L, 24L, hosp2WoundAssocType  c171L, 115L, 17L, hosp2BloodAssocType  c127L,  62L, 12L, hosp2UrineAssocType  c50L, 29L, 6L, hosp2RespAssocType  c135L,  142L, 6L, hosp2CathAssocType  c95L, 24L, 12L, .Names  cType,  hosp1WoundAssocType, hosp1BloodAssocType, hosp1UrineAssocType,  hosp1RespAssocType, hosp1CathAssocType, hosp2WoundAssocType,  hosp2BloodAssocType, hosp2UrineAssocType, hosp2RespAssocType,  hosp2CathAssocType, class  data.frame, row.names  cNA,  3L codepre  pExplanation This codedata.framecode is actually more complicated than what is summarized in the table above, as it also contains where the specific types of bacteria where cultured i.e. in wounds, blood cultures, catheters etc..

Negative 1292 pFor my college project I am trying to develop a python based traffic generator.I have created 2 CentOS machines on vmware and I am using 1 as my client and 1 as my server machine. I have used IP aliasing technique to increase number of clients and severs using just single clientserver machine. Upto now I have created 50 IP alias on my client machine and 10 IP alias on my server machine. I am also using multiprocessing module to generate traffic concurrently from all 50 clients to all 10 servers. I have also developed few profiles1kb,10kb,50kb,100kb,500kb,1mb on my serverin varwwwhtml directory since I am using Apache Server and I am using urllib2 to send request to these profiles from my client machine. Here while running my scripts when I monitor number of TCP Connections it is always lt50. I want to increase it to say 10000.

Negative 1292 pIam a little bit confused on which stepPattern to use with DTW algorithm.p  pI have to admit that a month ago i didnt know the existence of that algorithm.p  pSo the story starts with a specific type of images comparison.  As you can see below, is the way i chose to extract the time series data from images.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrNtaL.png altenter image description herep  pThe idea is to get the distances from all forks to the first fork as it sown. So for two different images you have two different arrays with distance values. A key point of that idea is that the values of these two arrays are correspond to each other. p  pBy that, i mean that the first value of both arrays is the distance from the second left fork to the first main fork as sown in the image with number 1 and so on...p  pBy having those values, i used DTW algorithm by using the a hrefhttpdtw.rforge.rproject.org relnofollowR packagea.p  pHere is where i want your opinion. I tried this in 2 waysp  pA Asymmetricp  pI used that, because as i understood from something i read that you can use the asymmetric stepPattern if you have corresponding values to check. To compare value 1 of the first image with the value 1 of the other image, value 2 of the first image with the value 2 of the other image and so on...p  pFirst i run thisp  precodedist  dtwF,K1,keepTRUE,step.pattern  asymmetric codepre  pand then i changed it to thatp  precodedist  dtwK1,F,keepTRUE,step.pattern  asymmetric codepre  pThose two different executions returned me different distance value codedistdistancecode. I didnt like that but as i understood latter that results must be expected because that method change only by the i value x axis correct me if im wrong.p  pB Symmetric1p  pAfter that i decide to run it with a different way wherep  precodedist  dtwF,K1,keepTRUE,step.pattern  symmetric1 codepre  pandp  precodedist  dtwK1,F,keepTRUE,step.pattern  symmetric1 codepre  preturns the same distance value codedistdistancecode.p  pAs you know, there are more than those stepPatterns.

Negative 1292 pCurrently we are setting up session in the cookie using codeexpresssessioncode with codepassport.jscode and codeconnectrediscode to store the data in redis.  I have multiple node server serving requests. For each request without a session, I am creating a new session. Sometimes, an existing session id is being assigned to a new request.

Negative 1292 pMy name is Stefano Fanti,I am a developer in Plexa.We are actually using your component  FireDAC  and I am contacting you in order to solve some problems we have not been able to fix ourself.br In our company we decided to port a legacy 3Tier DATASNAP application written on Delphi7 for the new environment Delphi XE7 , and we decided to use the new components library FireDAC too. Our application is built in this way  a Client side using TClientDataSet directly connected to the Server side with TDataSetProviderMIDAS and TTable TQuery TDatabase components BDE  We replaced BDE components with the related FireDAC  FDConnection , FDTable and FDQuery  without issues and we started testing thinking anyway it was not needed to perform it. After some test ,  a couple of issues have arosen   the first problem is related to the modifications performed on DB  MS SQL Server  , the second is related the the reopening of the table after applying the modifications. In our case , the RequestLiveTrue property  default  , doesnt allow to apply modifications  PostApplyUpdates to the Database. Assigning  RequestLive  False , we are able to apply modifications on all tables records except the first,  the last giving us the error .br The above anomaly have been verified on each Database table . However all database tables have the primary key defined properly. Trying to use FireDAC Help I read the option RequestLiveFalse excludes fiMeta from Fetch,Options, preventing the component to use the primary key of the table, being otherwise seen correctly in any other case. After several trials I found two configurations applied to the Server side, allowing us to achieve the result.p  pFirst configurationp  ol liFDTable.RequestLive Falseli liFDTable.UpdateMode  upWhereKeyOnlyli liwith FProvider.DataSet.FieldByName pkField do    ProviderFlags  ProviderFlags  [pfInKey]li ol  pSecond configurationp  ol liFDTable.RequestLive Falseli liFDTable.UpdateMode  upWhereAllli liTDataSetProvider.UpdateModeupWhereAllli ol  pThe above configurations give us the possibility to apply modifications to tables without errors , but nevertheless dont allow us to solve the second problem   reopening of the tables for each operation.  Indeed , the BeforeOpen and AfterOpen managers are executed each time. What can I do to avoid  the Table to be needless reopened after each modification   Are the configurations used to apply modifications correct , or maybe another solution exist allowing us to avoid code modifications causing us to lengthen development times p  pThank you in advance for your help.p  pBest regards Stefano Fantip

I also wanted to know if its possible to calculated the CRC of the frame on the base of the entire frame values And Is it possible to find a CRC calculation example in CRC16 andor CRC32 with explanations Im c so Im sometimes lost in Zmodem specs. Thks in advancep

But as following manner it will be a dynamic query and how can I execute it. p  pDynamic query I need to build, p  precodeString sql  SELECT usr FROM User usr WHERE usr.configurable  TRUE  forString word  filterText.split,                  sql   AND lowerusr.name like lower  word   OR lowerusr.userType.classType.displayName like lower  word   OR lowerusr.userType.model like lower  word    codepre
Negative 1292 pI have a Recursive Descent Parser project, and I earlier posted a problem that I was having regarding stack overflow error.

Negative 1292 pIm writing a simple chat program using sockets. When Im sending a long message, flush the stream and a short message afterwards, the end of the long message gets appended to the short message. It looks like thisp  pSend aaasdsdp  pRecieve aaasdsdp  pSend bbp  pRecieve bbstrongasdsdstrongp  pThrough debugging Ive found that the Flush method, thats supposed to clear all data from the stream, does not do that. According to mdsn, it is the expected behaviour, because NetworkStream is not bufferized. How do I clear the stream in that case I could just follow every message with an empty consisting of 0 chars one of the same length, but I dont think its correct to do that, also, it would screw up some features I need.p

Negative 1292 pI have a 1master, 7slave elasticsearch setup on amazon ec2. Recently the ec2 instance on which the master nodeversion 1.5.2 was hosted failed and all applications were shutdown. It has since been restarted and its stable, but this failure has somehow affected the master node. Each time elasticsearch is started on the master node, it receives an anonymous shutdown request and proceeds to shutdown. There is no error message of any sort, just the log statement indicating that a shutdown request was received. I have ensured that none of the clients or browsers are connected to the cluster when the master is restarted, but I always end up with the same issue. The related log snippet is below.

Negative 1292 pI have a class named as A and another Class named as B. Class A contains Class B as a property.p  pI have a business logic. Based on the value of a property in Class B, I have to calculate the value of another property in Class A. To do this calculation, I have to call a SOAP service, get a value and then, based on the value of a property in Class B, i have to do a mathematical calculation on the returned value from the SOAP service and then set the value for property in Class A.p  precodepublic Class A   public string Property1getset   public int Property2getset   public B Property3getset   public class B  public string Property1getset  public string Property2getset  codepre  blockquote   pThe logic in pseudocodep blockquote  ol liIf classB.property1  Something1 then call soap service,get some         integer value, perfome some arithmatical calculation using a constant, and assign the result to classA.Property2li liElse If classB.property1  Something2 then call soap service,get some         integer value, and assign the result to classA.Property2li liElse then set classA.Property2 to a default value.li ol  pI dont like the If else, it doesnt follow the OCP. I was thinking of doing this with a decorator. The second option is to use a builder pattern and encapsulate the if else logic, but still it would break the OCP. Or a completely new Domain service that would perform thisBut still the OCP is being broken if If else even if i chose to go the Domain service way.p  pThe above logic is being performed in a business logic class.p  pSo where does the responsibility for above logic of calculation go Also how to avoid that if elsep
Negative 1292 pI have some code herep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int main       char foo  0xE7   if foo  0xE7     printf truen   else     printf falsen   return 0    codepre  pThat prints false. Im not too concerned about that because I can believe that foo contains 0xE7, which is now considered signed 25 and compares false to 0xE7  which is 231 in decimal.p  hr  pBut what about thisp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int main       char c  0xE7   if c  0xFFFFFFE7     printf truen   else     printf falsen   return 0    codepre  pThat prints true.p  pAccording to the C standardp  blockquote   pA hexadecimal integer literal base sixteen begins with 0x or 0X and consists of a sequence of hexadecimal digits, which include the decimal digits and the letters a through f and A through F with decimal values ten through fifteen.p blockquote  pAndp  blockquote   pThe type of an integer literal is the first of the corresponding list in Table 6 in which its value can be represented.p blockquote  pThe first item on the list is int. And since the comparison is true it would appear that 0xFFFFFFE7  25.p  hr  pHowever, 0xFFFFFFE7 is another way of writing 4294967271. So lets tryp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int main       char c  0xE7   if c  4294967271     printf truen   else     printf falsen   return 0    codepre  pThat prints false. So, 0xFFFFFFE7 is not the same as 4294967271.p  pGoing back to the Standard, what do the words in which its value can be represented really mean Clearly you can stuff 0xFFFFFFE7 into a 4byte signed int, but that is not really representing the value 4294967271.p  pHoweverp  precode  if 0xFFFFFFE7  4294967271   gt prints true codepre  pAlsop  precode  if 25  0xFFFFFFE7   gt prints true codepre  pSo it appears that its value can be represented means at the binary level, not treating the hex constant as its equivalent decimal number. Does this sound rightp  pTested on gcc 4.8.2, Ubuntu 14.04, 64bit processor.p

Negative 1292 pA custom type by default is moved through default assignment. By implementing the codeCopycode trait, I get copy semantics through default assignment.p  pAs I understand it, I also get deep copy semantics on a codeCopycode type by impling and using the codeClonecode trait, and explicitly copying the object that the methodfnwhatever was going to consume through a move.p  pIs there a way to force a move on a codeCopycode type I tried using the codemovecode keyword and through a closure codelet newid  move  idcode but the error message tells me Im emvery wrongem.p  pIm not into closures yet but from seeing them here and there had thought that thatd work.p  pstrongEditstrong The purpose, simply, is to sometimes surrender a codeCopycode value completely to a function or the like, and have the compiler error if the variable is not given a new value afterwards. Thiss how normal moveassignment works all the time, not how copy works at all.p  pTo stress the purpose is emnotem optimization.p

Negative 1292 pIm working with the Racket macro extension codesyntaxidrulescode, that some other Scheme implementations provide under the name codeidentifiersyntaxcode. These let you specify macro expansions that will happen even when the defined identifier isnt in head position. So for examplep  precodedefine hidden f definesyntax proxy   syntaxidrules set     [set proxy v set hidden v]     [proxy hidden] codepre  pwill set up the identifier codeproxycode to be a proxy for codehiddencode. This is a useless example, but it illustrates the usage.p  pI find myself in a situation where I want a global ordinary macro, lets call it codefoocode, that I want to override in some cases where Im using an identifier macro like codeproxycode. That is, I want to be able to do something like thisp  precodedefinesyntax foo   syntaxrules      [foo arg ... default]  define hidden f definesyntax proxy   syntaxidrules foo set     [foo proxy arg ... special]     [set proxy v set hidden v]     [proxy hidden]  foo proxy  should return special codepre  pBut in fact the last line returns codedefaultcode, because the codefoocode macro gets expanded before the codeproxycode one.p  pAny ideas how I might achieve something along these lines, but with the codeproxycode identifier macro overriding the default macro definition for codefoocode Im not committed to the above architecture specifically.p  pAdded This isnt for any realworld usage, but part of a demonstration of a theoretical point in formal semantics.p

Negative 1292 pI am using the MCV pattern for my Mancala game.  The classes are not finished yet, but I can already foresee a problem in my design.  My model class represent the mancala board with a vector.  This board data is updated each time I call models member function carry.  Once called The board then has the END result of that move.  So when I try to draw the pieces in my view class they will not have the allusion of movement rather they will act as aspected, teleporting to their new position.p  pI originally had the model class update its status within its carry function, so I could access the data using a thread while the board is updating.  I tried using SFML threads and C threads, but I have heard they are experimental and not safe.  I do not have access to C threads and when ever I tried to use SFML threads the window goes unresponsive.  Point being I am not interested in working with threads right now. p  pIve tried coming up with some ideas, but I cant figure out a way to implement them without breaking up the carry function.

Negative 1292 pIve created a Cordova app and Im testing it on a Nexus 4. Ive used the basic steps listed in the Cordova CLI workflow to get up and running. Ive also modified my config.xml with thisp  precodeltpreference nameFullscreen valuetrue gt codepre  pMy app runs fullscreen as expected. As soon as I click on an input field the keyboard slides up as expected, BUT androids black top and bottom bars appear too, which remain even after the keyboard is closed.p  pTo make matters worse, they actually hide portions of the app. At that point, the only way to get rid of them and return to fullscreen is to quit the app and restart it. UPDATE Ive discovered that the user can remove them by swiping down and back up again on the status bar or tapping the recent apps button, but this is not obvious.p  pIs there a way that I can prevent the top and bottom bars appearingp  pIdeally Id like to avoid changing anything in the codeplatformsandroidcode directory, as Im new to mobile development. Perhaps a theres a config option, hook, or even a plugin that I can just drop in that would solve thisp

Negative 1292 pWe have a SSH server implementation which we are using Paramiko client to test against which consistently fails in host key signature mismatch for diffiehellmangroupexchangeshaX. I have figured out the reason for the signature mismatch but cannot understand which side server or the client is doing the wrong thing. Below are the reasons for the mismatchp  p1.Client sends min  n  max to Server.p  p2.Server finds a group that best matches the clients request, and sends        p  g to Client. where p is big prime and g is generator Now the problem happens where the server sends the generator of size more than one which is represented in byte array with preceding zeros plus with its length preceding it asbig num representation p  pcode00 00 00 04 00 00 00 02code  where code04code is the generator length and code02code is its value. H which is used for host key signature matching uses complete byte buffer for big nums for hashing.  H is represented by p  pcodeH  hashVC         VS  IC  IS  KS  min  n  max  p  g  e         f  Kcodep  pNow when paramiko stores the generator it removes the preceding zeros and does not store the length.br It converts g back to bytes and prepends the byte deflated gs length using leng for hashing using the below routine.p  precodedef addstringself, s                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Add a string to the stream.                                                                                                                                                                                                                param str s string to add                                                                                                                                                                                                                    s  asbytess     self.addsizelens     self.packet.writes codepre  pThis comes out to be just one byte so what we are essentially hashing for g byte buffer is as follows code00 00 00 01 02code where 01 is the string length and 02 is the value which is different form server g buffer hence the signature mismatchp  pSo my question here is which side is representing the byte buffer of big nums incorrectly p

Negative 1292 pIm trying to determine the percentage of various land uses in 76 watersheds in Alabama based on the National Land Cover Dataset NLCD in ArcMap10. I have the watershed shapefiles that were delineated in the USGS StreamStats online from sample sites on various streams. The NLCD is a raster datatset where each pixel has a value that represents the land cover at that point. I have tried to get the raster data within the individual watershed by using the extract by mask tool in Spatial Analyst, but there there seems to be no data in the resulting raster layer. What would be the best way to get the proportion or total number of cells of each land use class in each watershed It would be especially great if there is a way to batch this process. My apologies if this question has been answered elsewhere. p
