Positive 2148 pI am trying to create a report that can retrieve the results of a procedures output for the end user. It would serve as a proxy  broker of sorts.  In our Users Web Application, we can install a procedure as a webbased report that end users can run. We want to allow them to enter an ID number associated with the proc they want to run as an input parameter to this report.p  pProcess Would Look Like thisp  ol liUser enters ID number into public web report which is PROCAli liPROCA takes that ID and looks up the requested procedure in a simple table with IDProcname we will call this looked up proc, PROCBli liPROCA then runs PROCB, which returns a data setli liPROCA hands off the data set as output for the web report user downloads as excel.li ol  pInstalling a procedure using our Web Applications configuration utility as an enduser report is possible but a LOT of work, and we want to be able to have a single report that can call many different procs. We would only need to add the proc to the ID lookup table to make it available.  We have tried a bunch of different approaches to no avail. We know we can check to make sure the ID is numeric before using it in SQL to avoid injection, so that isnt a problem.    They are all procedures not calling functions and do not have any input parameters for now. However they return a refcursor rather than populating a table. At least the parent needs to do that as our Web Application allows that to be downloaded as an extract.p  pAny ideas how this might best be accomplished p  pso far, This works using the inline conditionals, but we are still not able to get it to run looking up the name of the proc dynamically. It may be because the proc needs to be called with the ref cursor passed in as a parameter which you can see on the conditional version that works. Not sure how to get that to work with the dynamic version see commented out section  p  precodecreate or replace PROCEDURE icrepextractretrieval    eid IN integer,   exout OUT sysrefcursor    IS  useprocname varchar2200  BEGIN  IF eid  1 THEN   icreptest1 exout ELSIF eid  2 THEN   icreptest2 exout END IF  SELECT PROC   INTO useprocname FROM OPSGENERAL.ICEXTRACTS WHERE extractid  eid EXECUTE IMMEDIATE begin   useprocname  exout end  END icrepextractretrieval codepre

Ive done my research with the as table of varchar2 and I think it just simply means a column of a table with varchar as a type.p  pFrom what I understood, the invArry declared as the type itemval in the iteminv header just basically means invArry is a varchar, since itemval is a varchar right But I got confused when in the iteminv body, the invArry is initialized to itemval again. Was it initialized to a varchar again Or does         the type itemval already pointing out to a column in the database If its the latter, Im not sure how it got pointed to the database.p  precode    create or replace TYPE iteminv AS OBJECT     invArry itemval,    invArry declared as itemval     CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION iteminv              RETURN SELF AS RESULT,     CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION iteminv recrd VARCHAR2               RETURN SELF AS RESULT,      FINAL codepre  pp  precode    create or replace TYPE BODY iteminv AS      CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION iteminv              RETURN SELF AS RESULT        IS        BEGIN           invArry  itemval    invArry initialized to itemval.

Negative 2148 pi have a small problem with a program that im writing. I have a table  stocks which contains informationproducts, barcodes etc. about items stored in a fridge. I then have another table  shop which acts like a shop,containing loads of products and their barcodes.some of the products in the shop table are in the stock table at the moment, and there is a boolenan field called stock which tells us if that product is in the stock table or not, if its equal to 1, it is in the fridge, if it is equal to 0, it is not in the fridge. Two fields in the stocks table are amount and quantity. The amount is what is in the fridge at the moment, the quantity is what has to be in the fridge at all times. When something is taken out of the fridge, that products amount amount drops by 1.  Each barcode in the stocks table has a matching one in the shop table. I need to make a query to the database from a python program which will order products from the shops table when the amountwhats in the fridge is less than the quantitywhats meant to be in the fridge at all times. So you need to take the barcode of a row in the stocks table where the amount is less than the quantity and match that up to the barcode in the shops table. Then in the row of that matching barcode you need to set stock  1.

Negative 2148 pIs this typical behavior of the UpdateProgress for an ASP.Net UpdatePanel  I have an update panel with the UpdateProgress control inside of a user control window on a page.  p  pIf I then make the page in the background do some loading and click a button in the user control update panel the UpdateProgress does not show up at all.  Its like the UpdatePanels refresh request is not even registered until after the actual page is done doing its business.  Its worth noting that it will show up if nothing is happening in the background.p  pThe functionality I want is what you would expect.  I want to loader to show up if it has to wait for anything to get its refresh done when after the button is clicked. p  pI know I can get this functionality if I just use jquery ajax with a static web method, but you cant have static web methods inside of a user control.  I could have it in the page but it really doesnt belong there.  A fullblown wcf wouldnt really be worth it in this case either.  Im trying to compromise with an UpdatePanel but these things always seem to cause me some kind of trouble.p  pMaybe this is just the way it worksp  pbEditbSo Ill clarify a bit what Im doing.p  pWhats happening is I have a page and all it has on it are some tools on the side and a big map.  When the page initially loads it takes some time to load the map.  Now if while its loading I open up the tool a user control that has the update panel in question in it and click the button on this user control that should refresh the update panel with new data and show the loading sign in the updateprogress then the UpdateProgress loading image does not show up.  However, the code run by the button click does run after the page is done loading as expected and The UpdateProgress will show up if nothing on the page containing the user control is loading.  p  pI just want the loader to show up while the page is loading.p  pI thought my problem was that perhaps the map loading is in an update panel and my UpdateProgress was only being associated with the update panel for the user controls update panel.  Hence, I would get no loading icon when the map was loading.  This is not the case though.p

A lot of big sites seem to agree friendfeed, delicious, and flickr come to mind and this question is about how to accomplish that on the server side.p  pLets assume the real URL for alice is foo.comuserpageuseralice and that if someone tries to surf to a nonexistent user page lets say foo.combob they should reach foo.comcreatenewuserbob.p  pThe user of course should never see the ugly real URLs above, just foo.comalice or foo.combob.  And note that the root namespace is shared.  For example, foo.comhelp should not get translated to foo.comuserpageuserhelp.p  pPresumably Im asking for some simple modrewrite rules, but perhaps theres some completely different approach to this that Im not thinking of.  In any case, I thought it would be good to record a definitive or best practice solution to this common question.p  pPS Feel free to comment on the merits of other alternatives like alice.foo.com or users.foo.comalice.p  pPPS I think Ive seen this issue debated in other questions but it seems to be tricky to search for.  Pointers welcome  As well as additional keywords to make this more searchable, of course.  Keywords  userspace, global namespace, URL namespace.p

Negative 2148 pIn VB.NET there is a keyword shadows. Lets say I have a base class called Jedi and a derived class called Yoda which inherits from Jedi.  If I declare a method in Jedi called ForcePush and shadow that out in Yoda then when calling the method on an instance of the Yoda class, it will ignore the base class implementation and use the derived class implementation. However if I have an instance of Yoda that was declared originally as of type Jedi, i.e. codeDim j as Jedi  new Yodacode, and called the ForcePush method on the instance, it will use the Jedi implementation.p  pNow lets say I have an event that is called UsingForce which is raised when the ForcePush method is called, and I shadow the event out in the derived class this is because Yoda has an interface IForcePowers that declares this event and each class raises its respective event.  p  pIf I have an instance of Yoda that is declared as type Jedi like above and I put an event handler on the UsingForce event of Jedi, and then the ForcePush method is called in the Yoda class, will this event handler be reachedp

Negative 2148 pI have some AS2 code that opens a SWF file through an HttpHandler. p  pIm trying to get the program to recognize when a requested file is missing. p  pMy first attempt involved using LoadVars and load, and only calling loadMovie if the file successfully loaded found the technique somewhere out here.

This way does call ProcessRequest only once whether or not the file is found. But my problem is that the onLoadError function is only working when I give it a bad URL.

Negative 2148 pIm writing software which is demonstraiting video on demand service. One of the feature is something similiar to IIS Smooth Streaming  I want to adjust quality to the bandwith of the client. My idea is, to split single movie into many, lets say  2 seconds parts, in different qualities and then send it to the client and play them. The point is that for example first part can be in very high quality, and second in really poor if the bandwith seems to be poor. The question is  do you know any software that allows me to cut movies precisly For example ffmpeg splits movies in a way that join is visible and really annoying seconds are the measure of precision. I use qt  phonon as a player if it matters. Or maybe you know any better way to provide such feature, without splitting movie into partsp

Negative 2148 pIm trying to use the bios video interrupt to display a character on the screen.

In the parent window, I have the following line,p  precodeltinput typehidden namemyField idmyField valuegt codepre  pThis parent window would open a popup window, where it would allow the users to make their own selections.

Negative 2148 pOk... this is sort of a twoparter here.  Sort of.  May actually just be one.  Thats what Im hoping anyway.p  pFirst, more generally, is it possible to target, via XAML only, a named item in a controls emtemplateem  For instance, if a controls template has a ContentPresenter named PARTFoo and we want to specifically set the HorizontalAlignment on that specific item to Stretch via pure styling, can it be done  I know we can do this in the OnApplyTemplate override of a subclass where we explicitly search for the control by name then set the property in code, but again, were hoping for a XAMLonly solution so we can do this strictly via styling and not subclasses, which are mostly discouraged anyway except for specific usecase scenarios.p  pAlso, we do emnotem want to have to manually specify the template for the control as we want the current theme to determine what that template is and thus how the control appears.  We just want to say In whatever template the theme has chosen, if theres a part named foo, set this property on it via pure styling.  If a part with that name isnt found, do nothingp  pThe desire for a XAMLonly approach is more because of the second part, which is were targeting a generated container object, not the control itself, meaning it wouldnt be a straight subclass anyway as wed have to muck around with ItemcontainerGenerators and such, which is a real pain in the a, especially when the ItemsControl is virtualized.p  pFor specifics, our ultimate goal is to single out the Border named Bd in a TreeViews TreeViewItems template and set its attached property Grid.ColumnSpan to 2 instead of its default of 1.  Thats it  It amazes me how something so simple seems damn near impossible without manually replacing the entire TreeViewItems template or resorting to a codebehindbased solution.p

Negative 2148 pIm implementing piping on a simulated file system in C with mostly C.  It needs to run commands in the host shell but perform the piping itself on the simulated file system.  p  pI could achieve this with the codepipecode, codeforkcode, and codesystemcode system calls, but Id prefer to use codepopencode which handles creating a pipe, forking a process, and passing a command to the shell.  This may not be possible because I think I need to be able to write from the parent process of the pipe, read on the child process end, write the output back from the child, and finally read that output from the parent.  The man page for codepopencode on my system says a bidirectional pipe is possible, but my code needs to run on a system with an older version supporting only unidirectional pipes.  p  pstrongWith the separate calls above, I can openclose pipes to achieve this.  Is that possible with codepopencodestrongp  pFor a trivial example, to run codels l  grep .txt  grep cmdscode I need to p  ul liOpen a pipe and process to run codels lcode on the host read its output backli liPipe the output of codels lcode back to my simulator li liOpen a pipe and process to run codegrep .txtcode on the host on the piped output of codels lcodeli liPipe the output of this back to the simulator stuck hereli liOpen a pipe and process to run codegrep cmdscode on the host on the piped output of codegrep .txtcodeli liPipe the output of this back to the simulator and print itli ul  pstrongman popenstrongp  pFrom Mac OS Xp  blockquote   pThe codepopencode function opens a   process by creating a bidirectional   pipe, forking, and invoking the shell.   Any streams opened by previous codepopencode   calls in the parent process are closed   in the new child process.   Historically, codepopencode was implemented   with a unidirectional pipe hence,   many implementations of codepopencode only   allow the mode argument to specify   reading or writing, not both.  Because   codepopencode is now implemented using a   bidirectional pipe, the mode argument   may request a bidirectional data flow.   The mode argument is a pointer to a   nullterminated string which must be   r for reading, w for writing, or   r for reading and writing.p blockquote

Negative 2148 pI have a GUI in java swing with a JTable and JButtons that implements both ActionListener and MouseListener. I use both because ActionListener cannot be registered for JTable.  If I select a row of the JTable  and press the JButton Delete, a row must be deleted. This works only for the first time I press delete.  The next time I select a row, mouseListener does not seem to be triggered. I print the selected row number whenever I click on the JTable.  If I consecutively click on the JTable the row gets printed correctly.  But if I press one of the buttonsthat trigger ActionPerformed and then JTable mouseClicked is not called.

Im clueless..p  pstrongEdit2strong After I added a few more products for testing purposes, some not all of them where actually available for purchase. Although further testing is necessary, it appears like only those products are available which are cheaper than the original one or are below some magical limit... Can you guys make anything out of thisp  pstrongEdit3strong After quite some time and even more testing, still no success. I am pretty sure now that this is connected to the product price.

Negative 2148 pI am attempting to have a bunch of independent programs intelligently allocate shared resources among themselves. However, I could have only one program running, or could have a whole bunch of them.p  pMy thought was to codemmapcode a virtual file in each program, but the concurrency is killing me. Mutexes are obviously ineffective because each program could have a lock on the file and be completely oblivious of the others. However, my attempts to write a semaphore have all failed, since the semaphore would be internal to the file, and I cant rely on only one thing writing to it at a time, etc.p  pIve seen quite a bit about named pipes but it doesnt seem to be to be a practical solution for what Im doing since I dont know how many other programs there will be, if any, nor any way of identifying which program is participating in my resourcesharing operation.p

This enters the path name as something like codeCfoobarfilename.txtcode .  When I run the first line in the interpreter I get out codeCfoobar,filename.txtcode.  The problem is that for some reason the last backslash isnt automatically escaped so when I run the codeos.chdirpath[0]code line I get errors.p  pMy question is why is the last backslash not being automatically escaped like the others  How can I manually escape the last backslash  Is there a better way to get the files directory and change to itp

Negative 2148 pI encountered a code design problem while working on a small application. Im a beginner by the wayp  pIn terms of feature, there are a list of tables, each having 2 seats. If two players sit down at the same table, then a game starts.p  pFor this part, I have a tables controller, a table model, and a game state model creating a game state means a game has started.p  pWhen a user sits down, it fires an ajax request which is handled by the tables controller, which calls the appropriate method in table model for sitting. If the table model finds out both seats are filled, the game starts, which is the tricky part.p  pI didnt want to have the table model call game state model because it feels messy and tracking whos calling game state model may become difficult later on. So I made the table model return a successtrue hash to table controller, which determines whether to call game state model.p  pBut then I realize Im putting logic in controller, which according to Rails 3 Way, is a nono.p  pCan someone more experienced than I am tell me what I can do betterp  pIm also having problem with forfeit the game if user disconnects part. Currently the user pulls the table controller in order to let my app know hes still connected. And having that part handle game forfeit seems awkward and coupling.p  pAdditionally, Im making the javascript code do one setInterval pull for each type of resource, in an attempt to keep things modular. But as a result, Im making 67 different AJAX requests every interval. And that seems inefficient.p

Negative 2148 pI have a hash that looks something like thisp  precode a gt some string, b gt another string, c gt yet another string  codepre  pI want to call codetojsoncodeon it eventually, but the resulting jsonstring cannot be longer than codencode bytes. p  pIf the string is too big, then first codeccode should be truncated first. If thats not enough, codebcode should be truncated. Finally codeacode. Also the strings can contain multibyte characters like German umlauts and the Ruby version is 1.8.7. The umlauts first take 2 bytes, but as json they are 5 bytes long.p  pWhat I wrote was a loop that converts the hash tojson and checks the length. If its less or equal codencode its returned, otherwise I concat the values of codeacode  codebcode  codeccode and shorten by half. If the new hash is too bigsmall, I shortenextend by 14th, 18th, 116th of the original string. Finally I get length of codehash.asjson  ncode.p  pIt all feels very hackish and although all tests check out Im not sure thats even stable.p  pDoes anyone have a good suggestion how to solve this properlyp

Negative 2148 pI know this is game design related, but I have read the StackOverflow FAQ and it states software algorithm questions can be asked here. If this is better off in game design then I hope someone can help me move it, thanksp  pI am designing a multithreaded procedural dungeon generator. However, I am wondering what kinds of problems I am likely to run into I havent been able to find many algorithms that clearly showed multithreaded in them. p  pI have three distinct objects which must be created. A World which houses multiple Rooms and each room will house potential Objects. p  pThe current algorithm works like thisp  precodeStep 1 Generate World Step 2 Generate Rooms and Objects concurrently codepre  pThe World houses a room list, and an available objects list. The Room creation method will generate rooms and add them to the Worlds room list. the Object creation procedure will not communicate with the Room procedure in any way. Rather, the Object creation procedure will pick random rooms from the Worlds room list and generate random objects in the room.p  pThe only problem I see with this is if the Object creation procedure finishes prematurely. In other words only some of the rooms in the room list will have objects created in them because the room creation procedure finished later than the object creation procedure. p  pAre there more problems, and does anyone have any advice or experience with developing such algorithms p
Negative 2148 pI want to load an image of dimensions larger than 2000x2000 pixels on the iPad to show in canvas on a webapp  e.g. 4000x4000 pixels. Due to memory limit, this doesnt work.

Negative 2148 pI am trying to extract numbers from a typical scoreboard that you would find at a high school gym.

I frequently get confusion between 31 and 71p  p3 cvMatchShapes  this one is fairly bad, it usually cant tell the difference between 2 of the digits for each input digitp  p4 Tangent Distance  This one is the closest, but the smallest tangent distance between the input and my templates ends up mapping 7 to 1 every timep  pIm really at a loss to get a classification algorithm for such a simple problem. I feel I have cleaned up the input fairly well and its a fairly simple case for classification but I cant get anything reliable enough to actually use in practice. Any ideas about where to look for classification algorithms, or how to use them correctly would be appreciated. Am I not cleaning up the input What about a better input database I dont know what else Id use for input, each digit and template looks spot on at this point.p

Negative 2148 pGNUMake manual 5.7 states the followingp  blockquote   p5.7 Recursive Use of makep      pRecursive use of make means using make as a command in a makefile.   This technique is useful when you want separate makefiles for various   subsystems that compose a larger system. For example, suppose you have   a subdirectory subdir which has its own makefile, and you would like   the containing directorys makefile to run make on the subdirectory.   You can do it by writing thisp  precode subsystem          cd subdir ampamp MAKE or, equivalently, this see Summary of Options   subsystem          MAKE C subdir codepre blockquote  pSo, basically it implies that codecd subdir ampamp MAKEcode is the same as codeMAKE C subdircode.p  pHowever, it turns out that it is not really an equivalent. When using codeCcode option, the directory path, if it is a symlink, is always dereferenced, so there is no way to get logical as in codepwd Lcode directory name. Consider the following example. Having the following codeMakefilecode in codetmpbcode directory, which is a symlink to codetmpacode directoryp  precodefoo     echo PWDLshell pwd L     echo PWDPshell pwd P     echo CURDIRCURDIR codepre  pNow, lets invoke codemakecode differentlyp  precode pwd tmp  cd b ampamp make foo PWDLtmpb PWDPtmpa CURDIRtmpa  make C b foo make Entering directory tmpa PWDLtmpa PWDPtmpa CURDIRtmpa make Leaving directory tmpa  make directoryb foo make Entering directory tmpa PWDLtmpa PWDPtmpa CURDIRtmpa make Leaving directory tmpa   codepre  pAs you can see, codepwd Pcode and codeCURDIRcode are always showing dereferenced symbolic link. But codepwd Lcode works only when changing directory before running codemakecode, which proves that codeCcode option to GNUMake always makes it dereference the directory path, for no good reason. I was trying to find any explanation for this behavior in the documentation but couldnt. Neither I can come up with a workaround for this problem without changing directory using codecdcode before running  codemakecode or wo very bad hooks trough codeLDPRELOADcode.p  pThe question is  did anyone else run into this problem before, have an explanation or a workaround Thanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pTrying to get to the bottom of it, I have downloaded source code for codemakecode and did not find any special processing of directories, only calls to codechdircode. So I wrote a little program to conduct an experiment, and here is what I found.p  pWhen you are in a symlinked directory codetmpbcode and trying to change directory to the same, the operation has no effect and current working directory continues to point to the symbolic link.p  pWhen you call codechdir code and specify either full or relative path, it dereferences it before changing directory. Here is a provep  precode cat cd.cpp  include ltstdio.hgt include ltunistd.hgt  int main       chdir tmpb     printf Current dir sn,         getcurrentdirname   Forgive my memory leak.     gcc o test .cd.cpp   pwd tmpb  .test  Current dir tmpb  cd ..  .btest  Current dir tmpa  cd   tmpbtest  Current dir tmpa   codepre  pSo it seems like either codelibccode or Linux is playing tricks on me that I didnt really care about before. And on top of that, bashcodescodecd is working somehow different.p  pStrangely enough, a hrefhttpwww.kernel.orgdocmanpagesonlinepagesman2chdir.2.htmlLinux codechdir code man pagea doesnt mention anything about it, but there is a note on it in Borland Builder sic documentation, a hrefhttppublib.boulder.ibm.cominfocenteriseriesv5r3index.jsptopicapischdir.htmherea. So I wonder what codebashcode does in this regard.p

Negative 2148 pIm trying to figure out which cache concurrency strategy should I use for my application for entity updates, in particular. The application is a webservice developed using Hibernate, is deployed on Amazon EC2 cluster and works on Tomcat, so no application server there.p  pI know that there are emnonstrictreadwriteem  emreadwriteem and emtransactionalem cache concurrency strategies for data that can be updated and there are mature, popular, production ready 2L cache providers for Hibernate Infinispan, Ehcache, Hazelcast.p  pBut I dont completely understand the difference between the emtransactionalem and emreadwriteem caches from the Hibernate documentation. I thought that the emtransactionalem cache is the only choice for a cluster application, but now after reading some topics, Im not so sure about that.p  pSo my question is about the emreadwriteem cache. Is it clustersafe Does it guarantee data synchronization between database and the cache as well as synchronization between all the connected servers Or it is only suitable for single server applications and I should always prefer the emtransactionalem cachep  pFor example, if a database transaction that is updating an entity field first name, etc. fails and has been rolled back, will the emreadwriteem cache discard the changes or it will just populate the bad data the updated first name to all the other nodes  Does it require a JTA transaction for this p  pThe a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4997620concurrencystrategyconfigurationforjbosstreecacheas2ndlevelhibernatecaConcurrency strategy configuration for JBoss TreeCache as 2nd level Hibernate cachea topic saysp  blockquote   pREADWRITE is an interesting combination. In this mode Hibernate   itself works as a lightweight XAcoordinator, so it doesnt require a   fullblown external XA. Short description of how it worksp      ol   liIn this mode Hibernate manages the transactions itself. All DB   actions must be inside a transaction, autocommit mode wont work.li   liDuring the flush which might appear multiple time during   transaction lifetime, but usually happens just before the commit   Hibernate goes through a session and searches for   updatedinserteddeleted objects. These objects then are first saved   to the database, and then locked and updated in the cache so   concurrent transactions can neither update nor read them. li   liIf the transaction is then rolled back explicitly or because of some   error the locked objects are simply released and evicted from the   cache, so other transactions can readupdate them. li   liIf the transaction is committed successfully, then the locked objects are   simply released and other threads can readwrite them.li   ol blockquote  pIs there some documentation how this works in a cluster environmentp  pIt seems that the emtransactionalem cache works correctly for this, but requires JTA environment with a standalone transaction manager such as JBossTM, Atomikos, Bitronix, XA datasource and a lot of configuration changes and testing. I managed to deploy this, but still have some issues with my frameworks. For instance, Google Guice IoC does not support JTA transactions and I have to replace it with Spring or move the service to some application server and use EJB.p  pSo which way is betterp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 2148 pLooking for a good SQLite Lua library. I found a hrefhttplua.sqlite.orgindex.cgidircitip relnofollowLuaSQLite3a but trying to figure out how to use it in Lua. Ive created DLLs to expose functions to Lua before with RakNet a networking library, but cant see how this SQLite would work. This seems to be setup to compile for nonWindows machines and I would need it for Windows. I can create a DLL but not following how it works. p  pThe examples that come with it simply say requirelsqlite3 at the top of the files, but I dont know where that Lua file is. The C code would create the DLL that I would expect that lsqlite3 would load in because Im pretty sure coderequirecode doesnt load a DLL as when I did my RakNet DLL I had to use codepackage.loadcode I believe it was. So lsqlite3 must be a Lua file, but I dont see it in the downloaded package. Maybe Im blind p  pAny ideasp  pI pulled the C source file into a new Visual Studio Express 2010 DLL project. Brought in Lua source and sqlite source and compiled the DLL. That worked all well and so I have a lsqlite3.dll file. When I put coderequirelsqlite3code in my Lua project I get an error from Lua saying it cant open the file. The file is in the same dir as my lua interpreter.p

Negative 2148 pI am new to Linux. I have access to two Linux machine, one 40 core serverA and a clusterB. I am trying to do the same on both machines, it works on A and doesnt on B. I have sudo rights on neither. A runs on debian squeezesid. B runs on kernel 2.6.18238.el5. I could not find any release info file under etc. A has gcc 4.6.2, whereas B gcc 4.1.2. p  pI compiled and installed locally on both machines a given meshing software Pkg1, and Pkg2, a given solver. Both need Libtool and automake. Pkg2 is a .so file. All work fine, I could run the examples. The code was built with mpicxx. Both have different mpi compilers. A uses openmpi154, B uses qlogicmpignu0.1.0.p  pNow I introduce my code, say Pkg3, a few .cpp files. I built a .so out of it. I did not use Libtool and automake. A simple make file, with gcc as compiler and linker also tried mpicxx was used.p  pOn A, Pkg3 runs fine. On B, Pkg3 crashes. It crashes when it tries to dynamically cast some type in Pkg3 to a type defined in Pkg2 with message St8badcast. For another data file, it crashes when a function in Pkg2 tries to cast a type from Pkg3, with message element type is N5ngfem8FESegm2E expected type is N5ngfem19ScalarFiniteElementILi1EEE p  pWhere do I look for problems  Sorry for being vague. All the software here is opensource, but the packages are too big to make a self contained repro with little amount of work. I have neither worked with automake and Libtools, nor with mpi yet, which compounds the issue. I looked into the makefiles of Pkg1 and Pkg2 and tried to map the CXX, LDFLAGS etc with my simple makefile, but the multiple indirections created by automakelibtools makes it difficult. p  pI understand the symbols in Pkg2 are mangled differently in the symbol table than the ones in Pkg3. But that should have been taken care of the linker I have tried with both with and without Wl,E options for Pkg3.  fPIC is always there. The rule to link Pkg3, points to library Pkg2 . I have posted the body of Pkg3s makefile.p  precode .o  .cpp      gcc  O2 fopenmp fPIC DNETGENELTRANS DUSETIMEOFDAY DLAPACK I.

But that is how it was specified to me, as reference.p  h3Note 2h3  pThe path defined in the link rule, Lhomelv70227elannglib, has pkg2.so.0.0.0, two symbolic links to it, and pkg2.la, not pkg2.sa since it was created by libtools.p  pAny hint as to where the problem could lie is appreciated. I have followed the same procedure on both machine, making minimum deviations to accommodate the different mpi, gcc, mkl libraries installed in A and B.p  pThank you, Elan.p

Negative 2148 pAs far as I understood, ZendTranslate uses strings as keys for translation files. This means that if I change the original string e.g. fix some typo, all translations for this string will be lost.p  pIs there a way to update those translations automatically My idea is to mark those translations as TODO when the original string has changed.p  pTo achieve this, I guess I have to use an ID based translation system instead of a string based translation system. Every string has a unique ID.p  pI know that a string based translation system has the advantage that equal strings do not have to be translated twice. This is a very rare use case in my application, so translation equal strings twice would be absolutely fine.p  pI thought of implementing this myself, but I dont know how to do it with good performance.p  pAny suggestions on this Can ZendTranslate handle changes in the original string Are there other translation systems that can handle this use casep

Negative 2148 pIn the Reminders app introduced with iOS 5 you have the ability to setup a geofence, so your reminder alerts when you come near an address. Location based reminds can also be configured for a specific day. Apple is very efficient about how they handle location and time based reminders in that they do not start tracking your location until it is the day of the reminder.p  pExamplep  pIt is Monday and I set a reminder for Wednesday to remind me when I get home to take out the trash. p  pIf you pay attention, you will notice that the location services indicator purple triangle next to the battery life indicator will not show up until the stroke of midnight on Wednesday.p  pI am curious if there is a public API that allows your application to respond to time changes like this or if they are using some private APIs.p  pI was able to find a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosDOCUMENTATIONUIKitReferenceUIApplicationClassReferenceReference.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40006728CH3SW44codeUIApplicationSignificantTimeChangeNotificationcodea and a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationuikitreferenceUIApplicationDelegateProtocolReferenceReference.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40006786CH3SW7codeapplicationSignificantTimeChangecodea but it is stated in the documentation that p  blockquote   pIf your application is currently suspended, this message is queued until your application returns to the foreground, at which point it is delivered.p blockquote  pSo it leads me to believe this wouldnt work. p  pMy other thought is to use UILocalNotification and set the notification for the time you are interested in and when that notification is fired, execute the code to enable location services.

Negative 2148 pstrongContextstrong I am trying to put up a Decorator pattern in Ruby. As a Decorator should delegate all unknown methods to the underlying objects, I used the Delegator class.

Seems good.p  pBut the thing I did not want was for the code handling the Decorator to know it is manipulating a Decorator. I want full transparency.p  pAt this moment codeDecorator.newObject.new.classcode returned codeDecoratorcodep  pSo I tinkered a bit and came up with this p  precodeclass Decorator lt Delegator   undefmethod    undefmethod class   undefmethod instanceof     Stores the decorated object   def initializecomponent     super     component  component   end    def setobjo component  o   end   def getobj    component       end   def sends, a   sends, a  end end codepre  pThis way, I can safely use codeclasscode or codeinstanceofcode on my Decorated object, it will send the method to the underlying object via methodmissing which is implemented by Delegator.p  pThe thing is  I dont understand why I had to undef codeclasscode and codeinstanceofcode. I can see that BasicObject defines codecode so I had to undefine it but what about those two  I looked at the BasicObject documentation and a bit in the C code but did not find anything. I looked the same at the Delegator documentation and code, and did not find anything either.

Negative 2148 pI am continuously getting data for my application as it runs, but I am having a bit of trouble displaying the data once I have read it in and stored it in a map.p  pWhen I try to display the data in the QML, it simply displays zero, despite the fact that I can see it updating in the application output.p  pI access the value in QML using property bindings I was under the impression that these led codeheadingSensorcode to be updated whenever codecarData.headingSensorcode changedp  precodeproperty int headingSensor carData.headingSensor Text   text Heading   headingSensor  codepre  hr  pIn my data class I havep  precodeQPROPERTYint headingSensor READ getHeadingSensor NOTIFY headingSensorChanged         int headingSensor codepre  hr  pIn the c implementation I originally hadp  precode    int datagetHeadingSensor         return data.valueheading[headingSensorReading]      codepre  hr  pWhere it returns the value in the map which is being updated with the incoming information.p  pThis I realized, probably doesnt work, because the property is dependent upon the headingSensor variable, which is itself not being updated despite the correct value being returned. So, I thought if I changed it to update the headingSensor value and return that it might work.p  pSo in my data aquisition logic I wrote a method to update the variables as well.p  precode                data.insertkey, value                 updateVariables                                void dataupdateVariables         headingSensor  data.valueheading[headingSensorReading]          int datagetHeadingSensor         return headingSensor      codepre  pWhile this led to the codeheadingSensorcode variable being updated in addition to the value in the map, the correct value is still not displayed in the QML display. It simply displays code0code its default value when it is initially displayed since it has not gotten a value from incoming data yet.p  pSo, I am wondering, how can I get the value of sensorHeading displayed in the QML to update as the value of it andor the value in the map changes in C Do I need to do something likep  precodeConnections      target carData     onSensorHeadingChanged updateValues  codepre  pEDIT Trying something like this, the onSensorHeadingChanged never fires.

Negative 2148 pIm really looking for advice here on best practices so I will explain the situation.  We have a fairly large application built on top of POCO and EF 4 with a complicated database.  While we have been happy with Entity Framework there are definite performance improvements to be made for example with the following scenario quite simplified.p  pWe have a table called News which has a collection of users that have added it to their favourites and a collection of ratings 1  5 by users for examplep  precodepublic class News     public virtual int NewsId    public virtual string Title    .......etc....     public virtual ICollectionltUsergt UserFavourites  get set     public virtual ICollectionltRatinggt Ratings  get set   codepre  pWe have written a stored procedure which returns news for a user and allows us to return whether it is a favourite and whether it has already been rated by the user we are requesting the data for and the current rating for News rather than use EF to build this data from the ICollections and we end up with an object like below.p  precodepublic class NewsDataModel     public int NewsId    public string Title    .......etc....     public bool IsFavourite  get set     public bool IsRated  get set     public double Rating  get set   codepre  pThe stored procedure is much faster and a single database hit rather than EF with Lazy Loading which could be multiple calls but the data returned by the sproc does not match the POCO class for news which is above.  p  pWe have been trying to workout the best way to move forward with this as we have a INewsRepository which can either return the entity framework related class or the custom DataModel class we are populating with a stored procedure and ADO.NET.  This doesnt feel right and I would appreciate any advice or insight from others experience about the best way to handle these scenarios when you want a single object with data built from multiple tables which would be a lot faster with a sproc than an entity framework call with lazy loading enabled.p  pMany thanks for any helpp

Negative 2148 pThere is a lot of posts about that and I have already tried to apply solutions that have worked for others, but still not for me.p  pFirst, everything was fine with a c project I am working on under Linux, with Eclipse Indigo, gcc4.7.1, cx11 activated, and Gentoo Linux. My project uses a home built static library. I made some modifications regarding some template class declarations. Then, I had some unexpected could not be resolved in my library.p  pWhat I did is to rebuild the index of the library, clean the project and rebuild it. It compiles fine like it already used to before the modifications and before the index rebuild, but the could not be resolved is still here.p  pOK, I try to see at least if my main project builds. There is one strongunresolved namestrong from the library. So I rebuild the main project index, and here, strongall standard keywords become underlined with a could not be resolved everywherestrong, and no compilation possible since it finds thousands of unresolved names.p  pI tried to clean and rebuild, to add many include paths in the project properties p  precodeIusrlibgccx8664pclinuxgnu4.7.1plugininclude Iusrlib64gccx8664pclinuxgnu4.7.1includegv4algorithm Iusrlibgccx8664pclinuxgnu4.7.1include Iusrinclude Iusrincludelinux Iusrlocalinclude codepre  pThat has changed nothing. p  pThe indexSearch for unresolved features finds p  blockquote   palgorithm, cassert, cmath, cstdlib, fstream, iostream, map, set,   sstream, string, tuple, utilityp blockquote  pI tryed to add explicitely the algorithm include path.

The children objects have custom validation and indeed this works ok, meaning that if I give wrong values the validation trigger and I get an error back.p  pNow I am in a strange situation where one of the model is invalid in the database lets not question why, lets just say I can go in the DB and run some SQL to make the model invalid. If I go in my app I can see the invalid values and this is fine. I fix the values and save again and I can see, stepping in the ruby code that the validation is called also BEFORE saving the new values, meaning that I will get an error and Rails will never execute the SQL to actually update the values to the correct ones.p  pI hope the above makes sense. Do you have any idea or do you think there is something I am overlookingp  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  pWhat was happening was that a manytomany relationship was validating the existing DB data before being replaced by the new data. Basically the structure was like thisp  precodeclass User     hasmany userpermissions     hasmany permissions, through gt modelpermissions  class Permission     hasmany userpermissions     hasmany users, through gt userpermissions  class UserPermission     belongsto user     belongsto permission     validatesassociated user        THIS was causing the problem     validatesassociated permission  and THIS as well codepre  pI simply removed the codevalidatesassociatedcode directive, since I am validating the linked records independently anyway.p
Negative 2148 pI have a Python program precisely, a Django application that starts a subprocess using a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2.7librarysubprocess.htmlsubprocess.Popen relnofollowcodesubprocess.Popencodea. Due to architecture constraints of my application, Im not able to use a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2.7librarysubprocess.htmlsubprocess.Popen.terminate relnofollowcodePopen.terminatecodea to terminate the subprocess and a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2.7librarysubprocess.htmlsubprocess.Popen.poll relnofollowcodePopen.pollcodea to check when the process has terminated. This is because I cannot hold a reference to the started subprocess in a variable.p  pInstead, I have to write the process id codepidcode to a file codepidfilecode when the subprocess starts. When I want to stop the subprocess, I open this codepidfilecode and use a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2.7libraryos.htmlos.kill relnofollowcodeos.killpid, signal.SIGTERMcodea to stop it.p  pstrongMy question isstrong How can I find out when the subprocess has really terminated Using codesignal.SIGTERMcode it needs approximately 12 minutes to finally terminate after calling codeos.killcode. First I thought that a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2.7libraryos.htmlos.waitpid relnofollowcodeos.waitpidcodea would be the right thing for this task but when I call it after codeos.killcode it gives me codeOSError [Errno 10] No child processescode. p  pBy the way, Im starting and stopping the subprocess from a HTML template using two forms and the program logic is inside a Django view. The exception gets displayed in my browser when my application is in debug mode. Its probably also important to know that the subprocess that I call in my view codepython manage.py crawlwebpagescode itself calls another subprocess, namely an instance of a Scrapy crawler. I write the codepidcode of this Scrapy instance to the codepidfilecode and this is what I want to terminate.p  pHere is the relevant codep  precodedef processmainpageformsrequest     if request.method  POST         if request.POST[formtype]  uwebpagecrawlerform             templatecontext  crawlwebpagerequest          elif request.POST[formtype]  ustopcrawlerform             templatecontext  stopcrawlerrequest     else         templatecontext               webpagecrawlerform WebPageCrawlerForm,             stopcrawlerform StopCrawlerForm      return renderrequest, main.html, templatecontext  def crawlwebpagerequest     webpagecrawlerform  WebPageCrawlerFormrequest.POST      if webpagecrawlerform.isvalid         urltocrawl  webpagecrawlerform.cleaneddata[urltocrawl]         maximumpagestocrawl  webpagecrawlerform.cleaneddata[maximumpagestocrawl]          program  python manage.py crawlwebpages   n   strmaximumpagestocrawl     urltocrawl         p  subprocess.Popenprogram.split      templatecontext           webpagecrawlerform webpagecrawlerform,         stopcrawlerform StopCrawlerForm      return templatecontext  def stopcrawlerrequest     stopcrawlerform  StopCrawlerFormrequest.POST      if stopcrawlerform.isvalid         with openscrapycrawlerprocess.pid, rb as pidfile             processid  intpidfile.read.strip             print PROCESS ID, processid          os.killprocessid, signal.SIGTERM         os.waitpidprocessid, os.WNOHANG  This gives me the OSError         print Crawler process terminated      templatecontext           webpagecrawlerform WebPageCrawlerForm,         stopcrawlerform stopcrawlerform      return templatecontext codepre  pWhat can I do Thank you very muchp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma134026391125413the great answera given by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers260897jacekkoniecznyJacek Koniecznya, I could solve my problem by changing my code in the function codestopcrawlerrequestcode to the followingp  precodedef stopcrawlerrequest     stopcrawlerform  StopCrawlerFormrequest.POST      if stopcrawlerform.isvalid         with openscrapycrawlerprocess.pid, rb as pidfile             processid  intpidfile.read.strip           These are the essential lines         os.killprocessid, signal.SIGTERM         while True             try                 time.sleep10                 os.killprocessid, 0             except OSError                 break         print Crawler process terminated      templatecontext           webpagecrawlerform WebPageCrawlerForm,         stopcrawlerform stopcrawlerform      return templatecontext codepre

Negative 2148 pWHMCS uses Smarty for its template system, though a great template system it has a flaw, the codephpcode tags. These tags allow smarty to interpret PHP code directly in the template, or in this case through the ticket system when a new ticket is created. This hack happens all the time to WHMCS systems, you can try blocking the code in WHMCS through block text option in configuration. But most of the time this doesnt work.p  pWhat happens is that WHMCS accepts the ticket and the hacker added the following to the ticket messagep  precodephpevalbase64decodeencoded messagephp codepre  pSo smarty sees the codephpcode part and immediately lets PHP run that command. So it first decodes the PHP encoded in base64. This will bring out some PHP functionscript that the hacker is trying to run.p  pThen eval takes over and actually evaluates the PHP code and runs it on server side.p  pA lot of hackers get in this way, they run codes that they know will work in WHMCS that then grab Database information and echo it to a file. Then they just grab this file through the browser URL and get the information they wanted.p  pThis works on only some WHMCS installs, though WHMCS says that the most recent version doesnt allow this and php is disabled in Smarty, at times the hackers do find a way to get around that and codeevalcode their code.p

Negative 2148 pTrying to figure out the limitations of the Google Maps API for Business.p  pIt appears that usage limit is 100K loadsday per one Business account a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationbusinessfaqusagelimits relnofollowherea. A business account can  include a number of authorized URLs up to 100, which can be as general as domains a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationbusinessarticlestroubleshootingauthbasics relnofollowherea. Meanwhile, a single website can load up to 25K loadsday for free a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsfaqusagelimits relnofollowherea.p  pSo my main question is  seems the Business account doesnt get you all that much in terms of usage limits  and actually hurts you in case you have several domains e.g., 8 domains which would have 200K combined limit 25Kx8 in the free case, but only 100K in case of using Business account. Is that how it worksp  pA smaller question are there limitations on which URLs can be authorized I.e., do they have to be within the same TLD or notp

Negative 2148 pMy question is this  strongemIs there ever a role for JPA codemergecode in a stateless web applicationemstrongp  pThere is a lot of discussion on SO about the codemergecode operation in JPA.  There is also a a hrefhttpblog.xebia.com20090323jpaimplementationpatternssavingdetachedentitiesgreat article on the subjecta which contrasts JPA merge via a more manual DoItYourself process where you find the entity via the entity manager and make your changes.p  pMy application has a rich domain model ala domaindriven design that uses the codeVersioncode annotation in order to make use of optimistic locking.  We have also created DTOs to send over the wire as part of our RESTful web services.  The creation of this DTO layer also allows us to send to the client everything it needs and nothing it doesnt.p  pSo far, I understand this is a fairly typical architecture.  My question is about the service methods that need to UPDATE i.e. HTTP PUT existing objects.  In this case we have these two approaches 1 JPA Merge, and 2 DIY.  p  pWhat I dont understand is how JPA merge can even be considered an option for handling updates.  Heres my thinking and I am wondering if there is something I dont understandp  p1 In order to properly create a detached JPA entity from a wire DTO, the version number must be set correctly...else an OptimisticLockException is thrown.  But the JPA spec saysp  blockquote   pAn entity may access the state of its version field or property or   export a method for use by the application to access the version, but   must not modify the version value[30]. Only the persistence provider   is permitted to set or update the value of the version attribute in   the object.p blockquote  p2 Merge doesnt handle bidirectional relationships ... the backpointing fields always end up as null.p  p3 If any fields or data is missing from the DTO due to a partial update, then the JPA merge will delete those relationships or nullout those fields.  Hibernate can handle partial updates, but not JPA merge.  DIY can handle partial updates.p  p4 The first thing the merge method will do is query the database for the entity ID, so there is no performance benefit over DIY to be had.p  p5 In a DYI update, we load the entity and make the changes according to the DTO  there is no call to codemergecode or to codepersistcode for that matter because the JPA context implements the unitofwork pattern out of the box.  p  pemstrongDo I have this straightemstrongp  pstrongEditstrongp  p6 Merge behavior with regards to lazy loaded relationships can a hrefhttpshibernate.onjira.combrowseHHH4135differ amongst providersa.p

Negative 2148 pFirst of all, some context about the problemp  pIm working in a system that has several types of resources A, B, C.... I am given some resources requirements and I need to determine if I can afford them. p  pFor this, I have some sources, each one can provide more than one type of resource, but I need to choose wich of them I am using for each resource. p  pFor example, if I need to pay 1A, 2B and 0C represented as 1,2,0 and I have this sourcesp  ol li1,1,0 Means I must choose produce A or Bli li0,1,1 Means I must choose produce B or Cli li1,1,0 li ol  pIt is obvius that I must use source 2 for resource B and I can choose for 1 and 3 wich one produces A and Bp  pMy approach to implement this is to view it as a dependence graph where the situation above is represented like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiCXui.jpg altenter image description herep  pSo I loop over the resources, and for every resource I loop over the links reaching it. If removing the current node for the current resource means the other resources have enought remaining reaching links to pay the remaining cost to pay, I use it. p  pFor the previous example, I try first to use source 1 for resource A. B still has 2 links, so i can do it. Only type B resources are left to pay, so I use the remaing sources to pay B.p  pAll right up here, but now I need to work in a new scenario, where have two types of source, each one producing one type of resource at cost 1 or cost 2, and I need to minimize the total cost.p  pA slight change over the example can be this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvQSnB.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe common sense solution should be use 1 and 2 to pay B, and use 3 to pay A for a total cost of 1, but with my implementation, as described above, source 1 is used to pay A because B has still 2 links to it, so at the end i have to use source 3 with a cost of 2.p  pSolutions implying trying all choice combinations should be avoided if possible. p  pDo you know about any general algorithmic problem with known solution that can be applied to this case Or how to improve my actual solution to work in this new scenario Or should I take another different approachp

Negative 2148 pI have created a Sencha Touch 2 app and built a production mode version. However, I have encountered a big issue with the production build and it running in PhoneTablet modes.p  pThe current profile implementation of ST2 seems flawed as even if you have a specific profile activated, all views are still loaded in.  In my application I want to be able to specify views using the xtype alias in the view config, and have the correct view for phone or tablet profile loaded in without any special coding. If all views from profiles are loaded in then this cant work one view will always override another.p  pThe only way I could achieve this was to dynamically add the profile at bootup stage within app.js like sop  precodeExt.application     name MyTestApp,      var activeProfile  Ext.os.is.Phone  [Phone]  [Tablet]      requires [ ... ],      profiles activeProfile   codepre  pThis has worked fine.  It means I can then load the correct view and still just use the xtype alias within the config of another view andor ref in a controller.  However, I noticed that when I generate a production build and load up a console window, both of the following are definedp  precodeMyTestApp.views.phone.Login MyTestApp.views.tablet.Login codepre  pNormally the tablet or phone version would be undefined depending on the profile. Im assuming this is the case because the production mode build has parsed ALL dependencies and then included all views regardless of the profile.p  pSo in my startup controller I have a button handler which then creates a login view from the xtype. p  pControllerp  precoderefs                              loginView                  selector loginview,                 xtype loginview,                 autoCreate true                codepre  pHandlerp  precodevar loginView  this.getLoginView codepre  pIn development mode, the loginView variable will either be strongMyTestApp.views.tablet.Loginstrong or strongMyTestApp.views.phone.Loginstrong depending on the profile.p  pHow do I ensure that the loginview instantiated here gets the correct version depending on the profile when in production modep

I guess I should have mentioned that strongI want it to work from the file system.strongp  pNext was to save the page as complete with all the environment using some kind of the Save menu browser dependent. It saves the page and all the related files forming a closure, which can be open from the file system.

Negative 2148 pI know similar questions have been asked a million times. Ive read them and I still cannot get to the bottom of this. Im using the Novell.Directory.Ldap c library in my code Winforms, c. It works very similar to the microsoft ldap libraries but it can also access the attributes specific to Novell eDirectory. p  pusing Novell.Direcotry.Ldap is in there. I also added the reference and pointed it to the Novell.Directory.Ldap.dll file. p  precodestring LDAPServerIP  12.34.56.78 string serverUserName  cnRrunner,oacme string serverPassword  nvi1  LdapConnection ldapConn  new LdapConnection MessageBox.ShowldapConn.ToString ldapConn.SecureSocketLayer  true ldapConn.ConnectLDAPServerIP, 636 ldapConn.BindserverUserName, serverPassword codepre  pI get a NullReferenceException when it gets to the ldapConn.Connect method.   Stepping through in the debugger is can see the ldapConn object, and it is a Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapConnection object and seems to have sensible values assigned to it. For example, it does get SSL set to true, and at the point of the exception it even has already had the Hoststring variable set to the LDAPServerIP, and the Portint set to 636 just as the ldapConn.Connect ordered. Given this information, I put a trycatch on just that statement to get past it since it is putting the attribute in anyways. It then will also get the exception on the Bind method, and bind did put the appropriate values userDN and password into the object as well. p  pThat section of code I copied directly from another program I usewrite and it works perfectly fine in that so I dont know why it shouldnt work in this program. The only difference is that this is a differnt project in Visual Studio. p  pGiven that, Ive tried going through the things again that could be different because its a different projectp  pIve tried verifying that the reference to the Novell supplied is in the project. Im fairly certain that part must be working because the object in memory is of the correct type and has a bunch of attributes that my program doesnt tell it about so they had to come from that dll file. p  pThe SSL cert exists on my computer in a spot where .net can find it as this is the same computer that I develop the program that does connect to LDAP successfully. p  pWhat am I misssing It seems like it has to be something really simple. p

Negative 2148 pI have a UDP server in a .NETMF application the solution would probably be similar for classic .NET Framework 4.5, except that there arent some classes and methods such as UdpClient. I start listening on a socket like thisp  precodeserver  new SocketAddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp server.Bindep codepre  pAnd now I want to accept data from a several threads one thread for every IPEndPoint. The point is to maximize speed. Note that I am using .NETMF so UdpClient class is not availible.p  pI had two ideas. First was to create a thread for each expected codeIPEndPointcode and acceptprocess data there. However the problem is that after a thread accepts data and determines that the accepted source IPport is different than the assigned IPport to this thread, this data is thrown away and is not availible for the other appropriate thread anymore. Is there a simple way to fix that See sample code herep  precodeusing System using Microsoft.SPOT using System.Net using System.Net.Sockets using System.Threading  namespace MFConsoleApplication1      internal class ServerThread              internal IPEndPoint EP  get private set          internal Socket Server  get private set          public ServerThreadIPEndPoint ep, Socket s                      EP  ep             Server  s             new Thread gt                              byte[] buffer  new byte[2048]                 int byteCount                 EndPoint recvEP  new IPEndPointIPAddress.Any, 0                 while true                                      byteCount  Server.ReceiveFrombuffer, ref recvEP                     if recvEP.EqualsEP cotinue this makes the thread to ignore                      to ignore the data as EP is different,but it throw the data away                       Process data                     Debug.PrintbyteCount.ToString  For example                              .Start                codepre  pThe other idea is to have one thread which accepts data. When a data chunk is accepted, based on the source IPport, this thread will create a new Thread to process data. This way doesnt seem to be too elegant as it would require creating tens or hundreds of threads per second. A little imporvement would perhaps be to create threads for each expected IPEndPoint, and to keep them in suspended state till a data for the particular End Point is available.p  pWhat is the solution of this problem pleasep  pThanks for any efforts.p  pstrongUpdatestrong The natural approach would bep  precodeserver  new SocketAddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp server.Bindep while true      byteCount  Server.ReceiveFrombuffer, ref recvEP      Process data     Debug.PrintbyteCount.ToString  For example  codepre  pHowever I need to process data on the basis of the address of the sender. So I could perhaps add a line with similar meaning likep  precodenew Threadnew ParameterizedThreadStartProcessData.StartrecvEP codepre  pand execute it each time after some data is received, but as the server receives tens  hundreds of messages per second this woudnt be too elegant either.p  pPlease suggest an optimum solution for my problem.p

Negative 2148 pI have a table that has an integer column from which I am trying to get a few counts from. Basically I need four separate counts from the same column. The first value I need returned is the count of how many records have an integer value stored in this column between two values such as 213 and 9999, including the min and max values. The other three count values I need returned are just the count of records between different values of this column. Ive tried doing queries like...p  precodeSELECT SELECT CountID FROM view1 WHERE MyIntColumn BETWEEN 213 AND 9999 AS Value1, SELECT CountID FROM FROM view1 WHERE MyIntColumn BETWEEN 500 AND 600 AS Value2 FROM view1  codepre  pSo there are for example, ten records with this column value between 213 and 9999.

How would it be possible for me to only have it return one record of 10 insteadp

Negative 2148 pI apologize in advance for the length of this note. I spent considerable time making it shorter, and this was as small as I could get it.p  pI have a mystery and would be grateful for your help. This mystery comes from the behavior of an rxjava codeobservercode I wrote in Clojure over a couple of straightforward codeobservablecodes cribbed from online samples.p  pOne observable synchronously sends messages to the codeonNextcode handlers of its observers, and my supposedly principled observer behaves as expected.p  pThe other observable asynchronously does the same, on another thread, via a Clojure codefuturecode. The exact same observer does not capture all events posted to its codeonNextcode it just seems to lose a random number of messages at the tail.p  pThere is an intentional race in the following between the expiration of a wait for the codepromisecoded codeonCompletedcode and the expiration of a wait for all events sent to an codeagentcode collector. If the codepromisecode wins, I expect to see codefalsecode for codeonCompletedcode and a possibly short queue in the codeagentcode. If the codeagentcode wins, I expect to see codetruecode for codeonCompletedcode and all messages from the codeagentcodes queue. The one result I DO NOT expect is codetruecode for codeonCompletedcode AND a short queue from the codeagentcode. But, Murphy doesnt sleep, and thats exactly what I see. I dont know whether garbagecollection is at fault, or some internal queuing to Clojures STM, or my stupidity, or something else altogether.p  pI present the source in the order of its selfcontained form, here, so that it can be run directly via codelein replcode.

Negative 2148 pso Im editing some strings in R, and I would like to delete everything that is in parentheses from a string. The problem is, Im not very savvy with regular expressions, and it seems that any time I want to use gsub to mess with parentheses, it doesnt work, or doesnt yield the correct result.p  pAny hints I have a feeling its a solvable problem. Might there be a function that I can use that isnt gsubp  pEx. Strings abc def foo abc def should be stripped to abc def abcp  pIf the only way to do this is to specify whats in the parentheses, that would be fine as well.p

Negative 2148 pOn startup of my application i would like to make an rpc call form the client to the server.

Negative 2148 pHere is the thingp  pI have a server with total 85 GB disk space and right now i have a folder with the size of 50 GB which is containing over 60000 files .p  pNow i want to download these files on my localhost and in order to do that i need to tar the folder but I cant tar the whole folder because of disk space limitation.p  pSo im looking for a way to archive the folder into two 25 GB tar file like part1.tar and part2.tar but when the first part is done it should wait for asking something like next part name or permission or anything so I can transfer the first part to an another server and then continue archiving to part2.

Negative 2148 pI am using a COMAddin in PowerPoint 2013.This addin does some processing and shows a message say Document is going to open to the user, when the user tries to open any existing presentation.p  pThis addin is working fine with previous versions of PowerPoint. But as PowerPoint 2013 shows the preview of recently opened presentations to the user and in order to do so, it needs to open the file. The addin starts processing and the message box is shown, even when we are on the welcome page of PPT 2013 and no document is opened by the user.p  pI dont want to disable the Recent Presentation option. Therefore I was wondering if there is a way to prevent PowerPoint from generating the preview of recent document by changing some setting in registry etc. Or if there is any API which can be used to prevent this behavior of PowerPoint.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2148 pI have a questionchallenge for the community. p  pI am working with [several] databases that are new to me, and thoroughly undocumented. As I explore and learn them, each time I look at a new table I have to start poking and prodding it to determine what each record is telling me, more specifically which fields actually make up a unique record. p  pOne of these databases is created by a process designed by my predecessors which involves loading a series of csv files to individual tables. No care was taken to do any form of validation or indexing, and all fields are brought in as nvarchar50, so I really have no clues via table structure as to what should be treated as a primary key. In almost every case, there is no one column in which I can count distinct values and have that equal the number of records, so what makes up a record is a combination of two or more fields. p  pMy questionchallenge is this Can someone get me started as to a procedure, algorithm, or even manual process that would test the possible combinations of fields for uniqueness, and report back the possible field combinations using the fewest number of fields that result in a set of unique records. p  pManually, I have just been cross joining a table to itself on every field, then commenting out fields. By comparing countem on the cross join with countem on the original table, I can know that my selected fields for joining are making unique records, but this requires a lot of typing, and my personal time to test combinations. Im hoping to figure out a way to machineautomate the process, and throw back possibilities that I may not have even caught doing it manually. The fact is, when all Ive got to go on is the data in the table, there are probably a bunch of possible answers using the fewest possible number fields. p  pI have hundreds of tables with widely varying sizes in both row count and number of fields. Most of them are modestly few columns lt20ish fields.p  pIdeas anyone Open to any approach. p

Negative 2148 pMy application is supposed to give a warning before a pc locks. It uses a timer, set to x seconds x  time before the computer locks with inactivity.

An even better question is How can I detect how long until the computer locks, so I wouldnt even need to have count or detect user activityp
Negative 2148 pI have a Time dimension that has Fiscal and Gregorian hierarchies that Im trying to use either, not both as row labels in an Excel pivot table.

Negative 2148 pI am having Intel Core IvyBridge processor , IntelR CoreTM i73770 CPU  3.40GHz L132KB,L2256KB,L38MB. I know L3 is inclusive and shared among multiple core. I want to know the following with respect to my system p  pstrongPART1 strongp  ol liL1 is inclusive or exclusive li liL2 is inclusive or exclusive li ol  pstrongPART2 strongp  pIf L1 and L2 are both inclusive then to find the access time of L2 we first declare an array1MB of size more than L2 cache256KB , then start accessing the whole array to load into L2 cache. After that we access the array element from start index to end index with stride of 64B as cache line size is 64B. To get better accurate result we repeat this processaccessing array elements at index ,startend for multiple times, say 1 million times and takes the average.p  pMy understanding why this approach gives correct result as follows When we access the array of size more than L2 cache size, then whole array is loaded from main memory to L3, then from L3 to L2, then L2 to L1. The last 32KB of the whole array is in L1 as it is recently accessed. The whole array is also present in L2 and L3 cache also due to inclusive property and cache coherency . Now, when I start accessing the array again from starting index, which is strongnotstrong  in L1 cache, but in L2 cache, so there will be a cache miss and it will be loaded from L2 cache. And this way there will be higher access time required for all elements of whole array and in total I will get the total access time of whole array. To get the single access I will take the average of total no of access . p  pMy question is  strongAm I correct strong p  pThanks in advance . p

Negative 2148 pIve been given a homework that goes something like thisp  blockquote   pYoure given an image consisting of pixels in four colors. Colours correspond to terrain, enemies, allies and walls. A bomb can be dropped at any coordinate a pair of integers. You are also givenp      ul   licodercode  bombs radius of effect in pixels, positive integerli   licodeecode  number of points for killing an enemyli   licodeacode  number of points for killing an allyli   ul      pfor example coder  10code, codee  1code, codea  2codep      pWhen a bomb is dropped, all enemies and allies in radius Euclidean distance are killed, unless there is a wall between them and the bomb ie. nonantialiased line connecting the soldier with bomb crosses a wall. When the bomb falls on a wall, this specific pixel behaves just like normal terrain. The rest of the wall is still a wall.p      pYoure starting with a score of 0. Find the coordinates where you should drop one bomb to get best score possible. If there are multiple optimal solutions, return any of them.p blockquote  pHeres an example image cropped, resized and with colors changed to improve readabilityp  blockquote   pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6gxo2.png altExample fourcolored imagep blockquote  pOriginal image Ive been given can be found a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comhZbul.pngherea.p  h1What I have already worked outh1  pI know that bruteforcing this problem is a terrible solution. I came up with an idea how to solve it quickly when there are no walls. Heres some pseudocodep  precodeargs Map, R, A, E  for every Soldier     create a Heightmap with dimensions of Map     zerofill the Heightmap     on the Heightmap draw a filled circle of value 1 around Soldier with radius R      if Soldier is Ally         multiply Heightmap by A     else         multiply Heightmap by E  add all Heightmaps together return coordinates of highest point in TotalHeightmap codepre  pOf course this emsnippetem can be optimized, but its easier to understand in this form. It could be extended to a full solution by constraining heightmap circles with walls. Drawing circles is simple and many imageprocessing libraries provide functions to do it, so maybe its a good idea to draw circles, then draw walls on them and floodfill circles from the center stopping on walls or circle boundaries. Ill check the performance when Ill be implementing it.p  pWithout constraining circles I would do it like thatp  precoderun the above code to get a TotalHeightmap create empty PointList  for every Point in TotalHeightmap     create PointObject with properties         Coordinates,         Height,         WallsFlag  False     add PointObject to PointList  sort PointList by descending Height  until PointList[0].WallsFlag  True     for every Soldier in radius R from PointList[0]         if Bresenham line connecting Soldier with PointList[0] intersects a Wall             subtract A if Soldier is Ally else E from PointList[0].Height      set PointList[0].WallsFlag  True     sort PointList by descending Height  return PointList[0].Coordinates codepre  pIt will work as long as both enemy and ally scores are nonnegative, so its far from perfect. To fix that I could loop over all pixels, but that would be terribly slow not as slow as bruteforcing it, I guess, but it doesnt sound like a good idea. The method of finding wall intersections seems crude too.p  pIm looking for a more elegant and emfastem solution to this problem. How would you solve it Ill be implementing it in Python with PIL, if that helps.p  pBtw I believe my teacher is fine with me posting this question on SO, I believe he even expects me to discuss it and implement best solution. p  hr

Negative 2148 pI am studying assembly for the Motorola 68000 CPU. The book I use isbr 68000 Assembly Language Programming, Second Edition, Leventhal, Hawkins, Kane, Cramerbr and the a hrefhttpwww.easy68k.com relnofollowEASy68ka simulator.   p  pI have a few questions about the conversion of a binary number to a BCD binary coded decimal.br The original problem in the book says Convert the contents of the variable NUMBER at memory location 6000 to four BCD digits in the variable STRING at location 6002 most significant digit in 6002. The 16bit number in NUMBER is unsigned and less than 10,000.  p  pExample  p  precode input  NUMBER  6000  1C52  output STRING  6002  07                   6003  02                   6004  05                   6005  00 codepre  pBecause 1C52 hex  7250 decimal    The MC68k is a bigendian CPUp  pSince the MC68k is a nice CISC CPU with a rich arsenal of instructions, it wasnt hard to code a solutionp  precodeDATA       EQU 6000 PROGRAM    EQU 4000          ORG DATA  NUMBER     DS.W 1 STRING     DS.L 1          ORG PROGRAM  MAIN                CLR.L D0                 Clear D0                        MOVE.W NUMBER, D0        Store our number 2 bytes to D0               MOVEA.L STRING4, A0    Well go backwards gt so we store the address of the last byte  1 of the variable STRING to A0 1 because we use predecrement addressing         MOVEQ 1, D2             A counter which will cause DBRA two iterations of the LOOP part of the program                 MOVE.L FFFF,D3         D3 is a mask used to clear the 2 most significant bytes of D0 in each iteration of LOOP         LOOP   DIVU.W 10, D0           Divide D0 by 10 the result will be saved in the first 2 bytes od D0, and the remainder our BCD digit in the second two more significant two bytes of D0                  MOVE.L D0, D1            Make a copy of D0                  SWAP D1                  swap the first 16 bits of D0 with the second 16 bits of D0                     MOVE.B D1,A0          Now the first 16 bits of D1 contain the remainder our BCD digit which we will save to address A0                   AND.L D3, D0             Use the mask to clear the second half 16 bits of D0 so that the next DIVU instruction doesnt by mistake take the remainder as a part of the number which needs to be divided               DBRA D2, LOOP            Decrement our counter D2 by 1 and go back to LOOP if D2 is not equal to 1          DIVU 10, D0             This last division by 10 will cause our most significant BCD decimal to be at the lower 16 bits of D0 while the second most significant BCD decimal will be the remainder of the DIVU instruction and therefore stored at the higher 16 bits of D0                   MOVE.B D0, 2A0        Save the most significant BCD digit                SWAP D0                  swap lower and higher 16 bits of D0                  MOVE.B D0, A0         Save second most significant BCD digit          MOVE.B 9, D0         TRAP 15          END MAIN codepre  pDIVU  DIVision Unsigned  p  pI am happy with that solution but I would like to knowlearn how the MC68k performs this division calculation of the result and remainder in more detail, let me explain. If we, for example, want to do the opposite, i.e. convert a BCD number into a binary number, we can use the following algorithm Lets take the sequence 7, 2, 5, 0 of BCD digits where 7 is the most significant digit and 0 the least significant digit. If we wanted to make a decimal number of those digits we can do it like this pseudocodep  precodenumber  0 number  number  10  7    0  10  7  0  7  7  number  number  10  2    7  10  2  70  2  72  number  number  10  5    72  10  5  720  5  725   number  number  10  0    725  10  0  7250  0  7250   codepre  pBut of course, we need to adjust the multiplication for numbers written in base 2. The MC68k offers more or less, 2 approaches  p  ol liA multiplication mnemonic like MULU 10, D1 which will simply yield a number multiplied by 10li lipOr a set consisting of simple instructionsp  precodeADD.W D1, D1             D1  D1  D1  2x   MOVE.W D1, D3   LSL.W 2, D3             D3  8x  2x  4  ADD.W D3, D1             D1  10x  2x  8x   codepreli ol  pwhich yields the same result original number x  10x.  The ADD instruction works like this  p  precodeADD D1, D2   pseudocode   D2  D2  D1 codepre  pAnd the LSL instruction is a logical shift left instruction. And we know that the result of logically shifting a number to the left by 1 bit is the same as multiplying it by 2 and shifting it left by 2 bits is the same as multiplying the number by 4.p  pSo, for BCD to Binary conversion, I can use a multiplication instruction like MULU in my algorithm, while for Binary to BCD, I can use a division instruction like DIVU in my algorithm.  p  pAnd also, for BCD to Binary, I can use ADD and Logical shift instructions to simulate the multiplication, but what would be the analogous way for Binary to BCD How can I simulate division and calculate the quotientremainder by using simpler instructions than DIV like subtraction, addition, logical shifts, ... p  pI also found an interesting algorithm for Binary to BCD conversion herebr a hrefhttpwww.eng.utah.edunmcdonalTutorialsBCDTutorialBCDConversion.html relnofollowhttpwww.eng.utah.edunmcdonalTutorialsBCDTutorialBCDConversion.htmlap  pBut I cant figure out why this works. Why do we need to add 3   11 binary to every column  4 bits which contains a number larger than or equal to 5p  pI thought about coding a solution which uses this algorithm butbr  after 3 shifts, I would have to check if the ones column contains a number larger than 4 after every shift  after 7 shifts, I would have to check if the ones and tens column contain a number larger than 4 after every shiftbr  after 11 shifts, I would have to check if the ones, tens and hundreds column contain a number larger than 4 after every shiftbr  after 15 shifts, I would have to check if the ones, tens, hundreds and thousands column contain a number larger than 4 after every shiftp  pwhich seems like the CPU would have a lot more to do...p

Negative 2148 pIs there an strongapplicationagnosticstrong signaling protocolp  pThe use case is this. We have an opensource library for a multiagent system that supports several protocols of the application layer of the OSI model. On the moment HTTP, XMPP, and ZeroMQ are supported for example. We would like to add highbandwidth realtime streaming possibilities. It is logical to use RTP for that.p  pSo, to recapitulate, we already have a connection to the other party that we can use for signalling. We want to negotiate only a new channel for data communication.p  pHowever, regarding the current standards, with respect to signaling all of them seem to be tied to their application. These current standards seem to be SIP, RTSP, and Jingle. They all seem to use RTP or SRTP on the application layer, and UDP on the transport layer. See e.g. a hrefhttpxmpp.orgextensionsxep0167.html relnofollow titleXEP0167XEP0167a. p  pThe only thing we want to negotiate is another connection to that party that can be used for data transmission.

Negative 2148 pReally stumped on this one, dont know where to begin.

Negative 2148 pInstalled Keplerbased STS 3.4.0.RELEASE current latest version and the Gradle Support package from the Dashboard Extensions. Now I would like to create a Spring MVC project from scratch that uses Gradle as its build and dependency management tool instead of Maven.p  pI start by creating a Spring Project with a Spring MVC Project Template, but apparently this is based on Maven, and there is no option in any wizard screen to switch the project to Gradle. So, after creation, I rightclick on the project and select Configure  Convert to Gradle Project. However, contrary to my expectations, the project still holds its Maven nature, dependencies in the project still belong to Maven despite Gradle having dependency resolution enabled, the codepom.xmlcode file is still there, and there is no codebuild.gradlecode file anywhere to be seen. Eclipses Console reports a successful build, which I believe comes from Gradle but based on emwhatem When I open the Gradle Tasks view, it is empty if I try to refresh it, a message saying that the model is not yet available appears, just before triggering another successful build. Then, when I try and remove the Maven nature from the project, errors start to appear, about classes and tag library descriptors that are not found anymore. I select Gradle  Refresh Dependencies from the contextual menu of the project, but it has no effect.p  pI try the other way around create a Gradle project from scratch. Unfortunately, Gradle templates do not cover Spring projects at all, and adding the Spring nature afterwards has no tangible effect, nor I am able to find a way to apply the Spring MVC Project Template to this newly created Gradle project.p  pOn the Internet, everyone talks about how powerful the import facility of the Gradle Eclipse plugin is, and how to create a Gradle project outside the IDE, then create the necessary files for Eclipse to be able to import the project, finally import it and be able to develop using the IDE. The sample project used in these tutorials is not a Spring MVC project, so I would be left on my own as the creation of the directory hierarchy and further configuration are concerned.p  pSo I wonder is such a thing as creating a Spring MVC Project with Gradle from within STS even empossibleem at this time Given that STS, Spring, and the Eclipse Gradle plugin are developed by the same vendor, you would bet it is, because it seems such a basic feature that would hardly be missing from even a first release of STSSpringGradle integration tools.

This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in your applications project, when using an IDE such as Eclipse. If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats going on.  However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality.  If you really intend to build a core library  which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application  then use the corelibrary option to suppress this error message.  If you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem.  If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation. codepre  pI have not got the reason of getting this error .

Negative 2148 pSo I am attempting to use an table or array to list and sort items this following sequence of letters, or items,  by what is eaten firstin the captured perl regex  These four lists are the exact same items, just entered in a different order, in succession.p  pinput items these letters represent an action or an input into the client.p  blockquote   pa b c dp      pb c d ap      pc d b ap      pd a b cp blockquote  pperl regexp  precodew eats aan w. codepre  pso matches[4] will be the item captured.p  pthis will trigger regex will fire in the client with each set of lettersa,b,c,d Entered, separately.  So four sets of a,b,c,d that will be input in succession but on a rotating order basis. The above regex will in fire 16x once for each letter. I need to be able to sort it so, if a is eaten first every time, then that will have priority at the top going down. But it might not always be a, it could be any of the letters that hold priority.p  pI need this priority list to be displayed to a Geyser such asp  precodePrioList Geyser.MiniConsolenew   namePrioList,   x70, y50,   width30, height50,  codepre  pI then need to be able to set each letter to a different priority list or variable. Because each separate letter will indicate a different action needed to be taken, so I will need to sayp  precodeif a  highestpriority then  do action  function end codepre  pI am unsure of how to write the for statement that will be able to sort and list these items based off the 4 groups of letters. I figure the list will have to be saved and reset, after each sequence then somehow entered into a table or array, and compared to each other for the highest priority. But this seriously beyond what I know how to script, but I would definitely love to learn this.p  pThanksp

Negative 2148 pstrongProblemstrongp  pAs the title says, Im currently experiencing an issue where the codeNSHTTPCookieStoragecode is loosing the cookies for our app when its initialised in background before the phone has been unlocked at least once after a reboot.p  pOnce the cookies are lost, they cant be recovered in any way, forcing the user to re login to retrieve a new set of cookies and recover a session.p  pIf app activity is registered for the first time AFTER the user has unlocked herhis phone, then everything works like a charm.p  pstrongContextstrongp  ul lipThis issue happened to us using codeNSURLRequestcode and codeNSURLSessioncode as well as using ASIHTTP and AFNetworking with automatic cookie handling, so we came to the conclusion its affecting the whole codeNSHTTPCookieStoragecode class.pli lipOur app has SLC Significant Location Change monitoring so itsbr triggered in background automatically.pli ul  pstrongSteps to reproducestrongp  ol liMake a demo app that performs a network call Lets call it CALL A, to authenticate to a server, getting some cookies in response to that.li liPerform a second call Lets call it CALL B that requires this cookies to be sent in order to work. If everything goes well, cookies should be automatically managed and sent to the server accordingly.li liMake your demo app be able to execute some background stuff, for example enable SLC monitoring. In the execution of this background behaviour perform CALL B again If its inside a background task or not doesnt really matter for the test purposeli liReboot your phone and DONT unlock it.li lipWait until the SLC, or the background behaviour you chose is triggered and CALL B is done. p  pTIP You can disable and enable Airplane mode to force an SLC trigger on the device. p  pProblem If in that time a significant location change is triggered, the app looses all the cookies forever, without any chance of recovering them in any way.pli ol  pAny help or idea will be appreciated.p

I have my codeStudentcode class declaration like followsp  precodeclass Student ltEgtimplements Serializable, Comparable   int studentNumber  String firstName String lastName String major double gpa  Student leftChild Student rightChild  public Student      this0, , , , 0.0   end noargument studentNumberRecordSerializable constructor  public Studentint sNum, String first, String last, String major, double gpa      setstudentNumbersNum     setFirstNamefirst     setLastNamelast     setMajormajor     setGPAgpa   end fourargument studentNumberRecordSerializable constructor .... codepre  pand then my Node classp  precodeclass TreeNodeltE extends ComparableltEgtgt   TreeNodeltEgt leftNode E data TreeNodeltEgt rightNode  public TreeNodeE nodeData      data  nodeData     leftNode  rightNode  null    end TreeNode constructor  public void insertE insertValue       if insertValue.compareTodata lt 0           if leftNode  null             leftNode  new TreeNodeltEgtinsertValue         else             leftNode.insertinsertValue       end if .... codepre  pand then Im trying to to declare codeTreeltStudentgt tree  new TreeltStudentgtcode and it is saying that that student is an invalid argument. I want also call codetree.insertNodenew StudentstudentNumber, firstName, lastName, major, gpacodeto add it to the node. Is there an extra step that I am not following or something I am not doing right I have done a lot of research on generics and also BSTs but I am having troubles tying the two together. please helpp
Negative 2148 pI know I can use Octave builtin ODE solver to solve a ODE system. Now I want to solve the multiple ODE systems of the same structure but with different coefficients. For example, I have the following ODEsp  pfunction xdotfx,tp  precodea  0.1  xdot1  a  x1  2  x2 xdot2  x1  x2 codepre  pendfunction p  pInitial conditions x10, x20 at t0.

Negative 2148 pI just started to learn about Express 4.0 in my Node.js app, and I found that it generated code.binwwwcode file, on which only the application server and port settings are written and everything others like middleware and routing is defined in code.app.jscode file.p  pHowever, Im not sure what this code.binwwwcode does. Ive used Express 3.x and I have always defined server and port settings as well as routing and middleware on the identical code.app.jscode file, and launched my node app with codenode app.jscode. So whats the point of using the code.binwwwcode Does it only separate the server and port definition from othersp  pRight now, when I create the package using expressgenerator, the codepackage.jsoncode includes the following definitionp  precodescripts      start node .binwww  codepre  pHowever, I wonder whether I should launch my app using codenode .binwwwcode, or codenpm startcode. Which command should I run to start my appp  pAnd also, when I deploy my app to heroku, what should I write in the codeProcfilecode file Is codeweb node app.jscode enoughp

limitata. e in particolare si segnalano la monografia il mondo giuridico e politico di karl kraus n. 12, tematicamente originale ma interpretativamente alquanto forzata la monografia schmittiana nomos

giudizio complessivo in base ai criteri e parametri adottati, il sottoscritto commissario prof. luigi alfieri giudica che il candidato adolfo sergio spadoni non abbia raggiunto una adeguata maturita scientifica nel settore disciplinare pertanto propone che al candidato adolfo sergio spadoni non venga attribuita l abilitazione scientifica nazionale alle funzioni di professore universitario di

Negative 2148   pI am porting a program from Python 2 to Python 3. I am having difficulties dealing with  interpolation operator, when values are bytes.p  pSuppose we need to port this expression from Python 2 codes srn  name, valuecode. p  pcodenamecode and codevaluecode in the ported version of the program are of type codebytescode. The result should be of type codebytescode too. In Python 3 binary interpolation is only planned for Python 3.5 PEP 460. So, not sure if I am correct, but there are only two ways to deal with this problem  concatenation or string encodingdecoding where appropriatep  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodegtgtgt name  bHost gtgtgt value  bexample.com gtgtgt  Decode bytes and encode resulting string. gtgtgt s srn  name.decodeascii, value.decodeascii.encodeascii bHost example.comrn gtgtgt  ... or just use concatenation. gtgtgt name  b   value  brn bHost example.comrn codepre  pAs for me, both of these solutions are a bit ugly.

This works and the code is below. p  precodeGets the next story from the same story type in line.  query SELECT  FROM news WHERE storytype2  storytype2 AND id gt currentid result  mysqlqueryquery or die Error in query query  . mysqlerror row  mysqlfetcharrayresult  numresults  mysqlnumrowsresult  if numresults gt 0     echo lttd width20alignrightgtlta hrefnews.phpid.row[id].gtltimg titleNext News srcwebImgforwardarrow.pnggtltagtlttdgtlttrgt else    echo lttd width20alignrightgtlttdgtlttrgt  End of the next button codepre  pHowever, when I try do the same for the previous button. All I ever seem to get back is the first id of that category regardless of where my iteration is. For example, if I am on news article 10 and try to go to previous one which say has an id of 7 it will automatically show the first news article within that category, say id 4. p  pBelow is the code. p  precodeGets the next story from the same story type in line.  query SELECT  FROM news WHERE storytype2  storytype2 AND id lt currentid result  mysqlqueryquery or die Error in query query  . mysqlerror row  mysqlfetcharrayresult  numresults  mysqlnumrowsresult  if numresults gt 0     echo lttd width20alignleftgtlta hrefnews.phpid.row[id].gtltimg titlePrevious News srcwebImgbackarrow.pnggtltagtlttdgt         else    echo lttd width20alignleftgtlttdgt  End of the next button codepre  pWhat have I done wrong p  pThanksp

Negative 2148 pI am using ADOMD 6.1 in an Excel 2010 Environment to send custom MDX Queries to an Analysis Services 2008 R2 Cube and to display the results in the excel workbook.

Negative 2148 pIve been told that IntelliJ has a .metadata equivalent, but I was wondering are people referring to the .idea folder More importantly, strongare IntelliJs metadata files scarce or abundantstrong compared to Eclipses metadata filesp  pMy problem is that strongEclipses .metadatas tend to have hundreds, even thousands of files which are a huge inconvenience for mestrong more on that later. p  pIve imported my projects into an IntelliJ project and theyve all succesfully run. I noticed that the .idea folder does not use a lot of space or contain a lot of files. However, stronghaving spent a lot of time on Eclipse, I know that the metadata files gradually grow in size and quantity. A new user me can not use his own experience to verify thatstrongp  pThe reason why this is an inconvenience for me is that strongI sync some of my Eclipse projects to dropbox and to my other hard drive.strong To be clear I do not use backup utilities which is different from syncing as I need my files to be changed and backed up bidirectionally. The problem is that strongsyncing multiple files seems to be very time inefficientstrong. Even syncing a single large file is inefficient, but it seems to take significantly less time. As a result, I can no longer efficiently code some programs in Eclipse especially in dropbox because its even slower to transmit data to the cloud.p  pSo here are my numbered questionsp  ol liDoes IntelliJs .metadata equivalent take as much space li liDoes IntelliJ generate more files or less files compared to Eclipse li liWhere are the metadata files storedli ol  pIf I have 4000 metadata files, I was hoping IntelliJ produces a factor of 110 of that amount. That would make my life much easier.p

Negative 2148 pI am trying to figure out if its possible to rename images on the fly  by that meaning if you can do some sort of rename function, so in code the imagenames are changed, but the orginal image name is not.p  pExamplep  pI have a database with a table containing 2 rows, like thisp  precodenewdiverse    id   tekst   active       pic  Row1            1    yellow     1    testimage.jpg Row2            2    green      1    testimage.jpg   ltimg srcimagestestimage.jpg gt codepre  pLets say on page yellow.php the row id  1 is called and on page green.php, row id  2 is called. p  pBoth rows link to the same jpg image, but I would like for the code the  to have the color from the tekst in the table as filename instead, so if you right click the image, properties would state that the filename would be eg. green.jpg instead of testimage.jpg  is this possiblep  pSomeone told me that GDlib perhaps could do the trick, but I have no knowledge of this.p  pThank you so much in advancep  pEDIT p  pSorry for the late response to update this question.p  pWhat I am trying to accomplish by doing this is in regards to SEO. Im in the process of developing a website with several languages I believe itll be in 10 languages, when done. For each page there will be images, and I would like to be as good in SEO as possible and therefore I would like to have the images named in their respective languages without having to make 10 identical copies of the images only with the filename in difference. Therefore I am looking for a way to write a filename in a specific language on the fly. p  pE.g. I have an image named 2012niceredmustang.jpg in my root folder on my webhotel. When I access my page in english, the filename of the image would be as the original, but when viewing the spanish page with the image, the filename has been renamed to 2012bonitorojomustang.jpg where the translated filename is retrieved from a table in a database. p  pI hope this clarifies the problem and what I am trying to do.p

Negative 2148 pI decided to backup my directory with git, so I did codegit initcode and codegit addcode and codegit commitcode and all. Now I can manage the version on my hard disk.

So I cloned the second directory to the first directory location. and I realize the first directory has the second directory as the origin, and the second directory has the first directory as the origin.

They are now cross gitting  p  pIm worried I may screw things up in this configuration of course I can copy whole directory to a third directory for safety. How can I make the first directory as the real origin and make second directory follow the first directory as beforep

Negative 2148 pI want to open an URL into a new tab, but I only find out the URL i want to redirect to after the click. I know codewindow.openurl, blankcode opens the url on a new tab, the problem Im facing is it is getting blocked by Chrome as a popup.p  pBeing a little bit more specific, the reason I only find out the URL when the user clicks, is that Im making a ajax request to another API, and want to redirect the user based on the answer I get from that API.p  pIm not sure if it helps, but here is the application, right now its opening on the same window, and I find it a bit counter productive, so I want to open in a new tab.p  pa hrefhttpiagowp.github.iomicToSong relnofollowhttpiagowp.github.iomicToSongap  pEDIT The ajax request only happens after the user says something, so I cant do it on mouseover, or something like that, I cant dynamically change the url element before the user clicks.p
Negative 2148 pIm still new to JavaScript and Google apps script, and this is the first time Im trying to use a TryCatch statement. p  pIm running a script that connects to a page. It connects most of the time without issue, but occasionally it wont respond and throw a http error Or, the response will be empty. I want to trycatch this response to have it run a second time if I get an error code, but Im not 100 sure I understand the syntax, because no matter how I format it, It either never throws the exception, or always throws it.p  pHere is some sample code Ive been experimenting with p  precodefunction myFunction    var response   UrlFetchApp.fetchgoogle.com    Logger.logResponse Code   response.getResponseCode  try ifresponse.getResponseCode  200  catch err      throw Page connected   codepre  pIf I can get this to work, Im sure I can figure out the rest. However, even though the log shows me I get a HTTP response of 200, it never throws the error Page connected. p  pIf someone can guide me on p  p1 Is this the correct method to achieve what I want, or is TryCatch for something else  2 The correct syntax.p  pI would be very grateful.  p
Negative 2148 pI have an MVC view that has a model with a codeIEnumerableltSelectListItemgtcode which populates a codeHtml.DropDownListcode Form select. I want to write code so that when a item in the drop down list is selected, it will populate another listbox also a form select with values from the server.p  pShould I use AJAX to get a seperate partial view that contains the listbox with the values on each click of the dropdownlist  Or should I generate a listbox on load and then use WebAPI to just get the data on each clickp  pIt seems like a simple problem but Im trying to figure out my models and views and the best approach.p

The bean gets certain values like the services base address from a property file which just contains values like p  precodeservices.address  http0.0.0.08080 services.address.ssl  https0.0.0.08081 codepre  pand other ssl keystore related stuff. Note that CXF will use the jetty configuration beans during its initialization process and therefore create a SSL secured connection for HTTPS invoked URLs  at least it did before the versionupgrade.p  pThe route now can access the service using this very simple routep  precodepublic class Endpoint1Route extends RouteBuilder      Override     public void configure throws Exception              fromcxfbeanendpoint1Service             .tologendpoint1Service          fromcxfbeanendpoint1ServiceSSL             .tologendpoint1ServiceSSL       codepre  pThis worked well with CXF 2.7.10 and Camel 2.13.0  but as already stated above, after the upgrade there is a protocol mismatch for some reason as hopefully can be seen from the githubproject Ive linked after cloning the project, you need to execute generatesources and then start codeServicesAppcode as Java standalone application.p  pIve also created a new branch for the versionupgrade to simplify the switch between both versions.p  pAnyone has any idea why the configuration of Jetty, which worked before the version upgrade, now returns this protocol mismatch error Am I missing any updated libraries I havent figured out yet Or am I configuring something wrong in first placep  hr  pEditp  pAfter further testing I am now sure that some API changes inside CXF led to the problems as the bean which configures the SSL secured Jetty server is no longer executed on startup, while with version 2.7.10 the bean gets executed.p  pThis changes the actual question to How to configure a SSL secured Jetty Server in Apache CXF 3.0.1p  hr  pEdit 2p  pI managed to get a SSL secured Jetty server running in Camel 2.14.0CXF 3.0.1 but only via a hrefhttpsgithub.comRovoMeCamelCxfJettytreeJettywithXMLconfiguration relnofollowXML configurationa. As we prefer Java config over XML, we are still looking for a method to configure Jetty with SSL in CXF 3.0.1  The skip of the jettySSLEngineFactory Spring bean, though, seems like a further CXF bug to me.p  pTo clarify, in CXF 2.7.x a jetty server could get configured in Java on creating a Spring bean which returns a codeJettyHTTPServerEngineFactorycode instance, as showcased in the masterbranch of the github project linked above. This bean was used by CXF while configuring the server instance and therefore set up the SSL secured Jetty server. However, in CXF 3.0.1 this bean no longer is invoked  only codeJettyDestinationFactorycode which I have no clue on how to set up a SSL secured server with. Also the XML example prestended a hrefhttpcxf.apache.orgdocsjettyconfiguration.html relnofollowin the docsa gives no clue on how to set up Jetty with SSL using a destination factory.p  pAs the codeenginefactorycode inside the XML example in the docs actually maps to a codeJettyHTTPServerEngineFactorycode and Jetty configuration over XML is working fine, this seems to pinpoint a Spring bean injection bug inside CXF 3.0.1 to me.p

Negative 2148 pI am using a certain API to fetch data from a server and store it my DB. Since the size of the data is very large, I am doing it this way as realtime fetching would take a lot of time.The point is the master DB might be updated records updated, created or even dropped from the DB. To update the DB, one way is to refetch the data again and check each record if any changes have occured to it. This way is not efficient.p  pIs there any other way to do DB synchronization between both of them ensuring that my DB is up to datep

Negative 2148 pI have a C server that implements supplierconsumer pattern. This server has a supplier thread that produces some data. Several consumer threads consume the data. Access to the data is properly locked so everything works fine. But sometimes the supplier thread cannot get the data. In this case it throws an exception. The exception is caught within the same thread. But after the exception is occurred it is necessary to throw this same exception on every consumer thread. So I have a question is it safe to throw one exception object several times on multiple threads I know that CLR Exception and all classes that inherit Exception must have code[Serializable]code attribute. This maybe an indication that Exception object is serialized on throwing, but I couldnt find any info on this.        p

Negative 2148 pI want to create a 32 bit number out of an ASCIIstring. CRC32 algorithm is exactly what Im looking for but I cant use it because the table it requires is way too huge it is for an embedded systems where ressources are VERY rare.p  pSo any suggestions for a fast and slim CRC algorithm It does not matter when collissions are a bit more probable than with the original CRC32.p  pThanksp

Negative 2148 pIm trying to cross compile openssl for 2 embedded controllers. Both Systems have similar hardware linuxppc just different Linux Kernel versions.

Negative 2148 pI have two webpages on my website a welcome page with links to other pages, and a bio page and some other pages, irrelevant atm. The bio page has a cloud effect so that the background scrolls slower than the content. When you click the link to the bio page, the welcome page uses .load to load the content of the bio page into a div with idbodyContent, and the link tag to my css is changed so that it now points to the css from the bio. The javascript is also loaded so that the scrolling functions work. You can check it out here jamesstevenson.co.nfTestVersion and jamesstevenson.co.nfTestVersionbio.p  pNow, when I load the bio page into the welcome page, everything looks fine, but nothing happens when you scroll. What should happen is that the div with idground gets .cssbackgroundposition, somethingIf I look in the chrome javascript console, I can type ground and the console will show that the div does in fact have the backgroundposition set correctly, but the browser isnt displaying anything different. Further, if I type ground.html, it returns the div with a blank interior, but nothing actually changes on the page. If I navigate directly to the bio page and try this, the whole page goes blank.p  pWhats going on here let me know if I should post the code.p  pEDIT heres the code. I should have done this in the first place. Just ignore other issues, its a work in progress.

Negative 2148 pI want to use multisampling in my program, but everything I find uses just one or two fuctions to enable multisampling and consider it done. I want to make my own stencil buffer, and apply it on the multisampler, making it only oversample the pixels I choose. Basically I want to make my own edge detection algorithm. Is it possible with OpenGL I use SDL if that matters...p
Negative 2148 pThis is more of a design question while integrating couchbase with elastic search plugin. I have used couchbase with multitenancy in our previous product and we followed the the very first suggestion we found on couchbase blog here a hrefhttpblog.couchbase.commultitenancycouchbaseserver relnofollowSingle Couchbase Bucket for All Tenantsa. p  pNow we are researching on exploiting elastic search features on couchbase data using the couchbase elastic search plugin. Going through the couchbase elastic search plugin documentation installing and setup I realized that you will be able to map only one codecouchbase bucketcode to one codeelasticsearch indexcode. That documentation can be found here a hrefhttpdocs.couchbase.comadminelasticupdateconfig.html relnofollowElasticsearch plugin configurationa and here a hrefhttpdocs.couchbase.comadminelasticconnecttocluster.html relnofollowConnecting to Clustera. Now in that case, just as couchbase bucket, all the documents regardless of the tenant will reside in the same index.p  pNow heres my question. Regardless of how the documents are stored in couchbase, I would like elasticsearch to index to be per tenant. I am still quite new to playing around with the integration between these 2 systems but I am assuming that having separate search index per tenant and each tenantindex having many different types of its own can most definitely 1 increase search performance per tenant 2 the performance of a particular search query on a specific tenant that might have minimal sets of data will not be impacted by having huge sets of data for some other tenant on the same index although not plausible, assuming that the data sets between tenants differ by a factor of 50xp  pWhat I am wondering is, are my concerns valid. Will performance on search queries be impacted by having all the tenants indexed together And if so, anyone has any solutions on how can achieve this using couchbase elastic search plugin  p  pAll help and thoughts appreciated p

Negative 2148 pEssentially, I want to make a color spectrum where I have multiple individual colored divs next to each other, each with a link to a different site.

Everything I have tried puts them underneath the one before it. I know it will be a lame color spectrum if it only has 6 colors, but that is okay.p  pAlthough, if theres a way to blend the divs together as well while still preserving their hitbox to be forwarded to a link in order to give it a bit more of a rainbowy feel, that would be very helpful too. But getting them in order is more important. For now.p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 2148 pThis must be the stupidest question and Im sure it was covered in some basic tutorial, but here it isp  pIm using Xcode 6, and creating a new UITableView in storyboard. I get the default Row Height as 44. Whenever Im running the application using simulator, and any of the iPhone 4s, 5, 5s, and 6, my row height changes to 88 For iPhone 6 Plus it triples.p  pThe reason Im asking is because Im trying to create a full length and height background for each custom cell in the Table View, so Ive created images with size 44x640 image1.png, and 88x1280 image12x.png. But when I run the application, I noticed that the image12x.png is displayed all the time, and instead of being displayed in full, it gets cut off.p  pSo, is there a guideline on how to make these sort of images that would go into table view cells Should I make images as 44x320, 88x640 and 132x960.

Negative 2148 pSo I have two projects in VS 2010, the first is a windows form app that handles the configuration of a game the two projects together make up a game. The second project that is a dependency of the first  the first has a reference to it is an XNA game. Since I integrated the two, everything has been fine, I press the play button, the first form in the first project opens, I can configure it through another form, then that form runs the game. Now what happens is when I press play VS skips over the first project entirely, and starts the game. This is really really weird, it started happening just after I restarted my computer and I cant figure out why it is happening.p

Negative 2148 pI am having troubles figuring out how to approach thisp  pId like to have a TableView in my scene graph that will represent a certain class Product. The class has a String type field that I would like to use to categorize the products. Therefore, I would like to populate the TableView in a loop, adding all the products , while adding a Category row before each specific type of product. p  pSo If I have for example 10 products and lets say 6 of them are of type Alcohol and the rest of type Food , the first row of the TableView would have its name column set to ALCOHOL and the rest of the columns would be blank, while the whole row would have a slightly different formatting bg color and font mostly. Then after the last Product of type Alcohol there would be another row like that , saying Food etc.p  pAny ideas how could I do this  As far as I know, a TableView can only represent one class and I cannot create more than one table because I need the fixed column headers functionality when scrolling.p  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 2148 pIm facing a problem and want to ask for a solution.p  pIm working on an eclipse plugin project, in which an editor for a type of resource file is required. The resource file has similar structure like csv file. My idea is to provide user the option to edit this type of file both in plain text format and also in an SWT table. Plain text is required for examining data and table provides more flexibility to editing such as sorting by column. p  pI have been able to create a codeMultiPageEditorPartcode, with one page of codeorg.eclipse.ui.editors.text.TextEditorcode, and another page with a codeorg.eclipse.swt.widgets.Tablecode and several other widgets like search bar. The content of the resource file can be shown in the codeTextEditorcode, can also be edited and saved. On the other hand, the content can be loaded in the table too, sorting and searching all work good. p  pThe problem is when I edit a cell in the table, I want the change also reflected in the codeTextEditorcode, and vice versa. Since the resource file can be very large, I want the saving action happen only on the codeTextEditorcode, i.e. I dont want any modification in the table directly stored to resource file, but to mark the file dirty. But I cant figure out how. How can I for example get the content of codeEditorInputcode, check it line by line, and modify it outside codeTextEditorcodep  pOr, are there more efficient ways to do this Can anyone give any hintsp

It also increases the the SNAPSHOTversion of strongAstrong in the developbranch.p  pThe strong2ndstrong Jenkins job merges the releasebranch changes back to the developbranch except the version in the pom.xml and also merges the changes of the releasebranch to the masterbranch. Afterwards, it builds an artifact off the masterbranch, uploads the artifact to a nexus server and deletes the releasebranch.p  pWhat I want I want to automatically change the dependency version of strongBstrong that yet is a range to the newest releaseversion of strongBstrong, during the strong2ndstrong job is running. Meaning After the strong2ndstrong job is done, I want to have the dependencyversion of strongBstrong to be set to the latest releaseversion of strongBstrong emonlyem in the masterbranch and of course in the released artifact, but still be a version range in the developbranch.p  pI tried to manipulate the pom.xml of strongAstrong in between the emJGit Flow Pluginem steps in many different ways, to reach my aim, using the a hrefhttpmojo.codehaus.orgversionsmavenplugin relnofollow titleVersions Maven Plugin  Introduction  Mojo  CodehausMaven Versions Plugina. But it only made the emJGit Flow Pluginem crash in one way, or another.p  pCan you please help me here There must be a simple solution for this. Thanksp

Negative 2148 pI am currently working on Google play game services for my app, but i have great problems in testing it, because the services need the signature of my app to allow access. To be able to sign my app I have to do a release build using cordova cli, because the debug build get signed automatically. My problem now is if I want to test my app it has to signed with the key assigned to the services, but if I sign it I can no longer use chrome remote debugging.p  pSolutions that come to my mind would bep  ol liFind out the key used to sign the debug build and give it to the servicesli liHave the possibility to create a debug able build which is unsigned so I can sign it with my keyli liCreate a version of the services which do not check for a signature web version or other but still accessible out of a cordova appli ol  pI currently work with cordova 5.0 and use the following plugin for the services access a hrefhttpsgithub.comptgamrcordovagoogleplaygame relnofollowhttpsgithub.comptgamrcordovagoogleplaygamea, but i have to say that Im not totally happy with the plugin, so if you could also give me a better plugin or solution i would be happy.p  pI also looked at the official google api for java script a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibraryjavascriptstartstartjs relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibraryjavascriptstartstartjsa, but wasnt able to get it to work in my cordova app. Any solution here would also be the appreciated.p  pThanks and Greetings, FallenRiteMonkp

Negative 2148 pIm tackling something Ive not dealt with before and would really appreciate some pointers to get me started.p  pIm creating a Web API project to bridgeinterface two other applications.  One application will be posting data not XML into my application of which I need to transform based on an XSD schema and then post back out to another application as XML.p  pIve successfully created C classes based on a couple of XSD schemas via the XSD.exe utility.  Also I have created a model to holdrecieve the posted data from application 1. I now need to reformat this data to meet the XML structure for application 2.p  pThe structure of the XML that I need to pass is similar to thisp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 ltNewItem xsischemaLocationhttpexample.com.. xmlnsxsihttpwwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xmlnshttpexample.com..gt ltCreateSystemIDgtMyAppID12345ltCreateSystemIDgt    ltSystemDetailsgt       ltColourgtGreenltColourgt       ltUsagegtHeaveyltUsagegt       ltBaseLocationgtTBAltBaseLocationgt    ltSystemDetailsgt  ltNewItemgt codepre  pI can post data to the controller which works fine and is stored in my holding model.  Here comes the tricky partp  pI have two XSD schemas, one which has a single entry for CreateSystemID which is the parenttop level.  And a second schema which specs out the fields found in the SystemDetails section.p  pI wasnt sure how to concatenatestitch the two XSD schemas together.  So I concluded that I needed to create another C model.  Effectively creating the fields in a nested format, which to some degree recreates my XML structure.p  precodepublic class NewItemModel  public string CreateSystemID getset public SystemDetailsModel SystemDetailsModel get set   public class SystemDetailsModel   public string Colour getset public string Usage getset public string BaseLocation getset  codepre  pThe output from a transformation method Ive started to write does something like thisp  precodepublic IEnumerableltNewItemModelgt SetupNewItemIEnumerableltModelApp1gt passInItems  var items  passInItems.Selectx gt new  var CreateItem  NewItemModel     CreateSystemID  Test Entry,    SystemDetailsModel  new SystemDetailsModel     Colour  x.color    Usage  x.uses    BaseLocation  x.region    codepre  pHowever Im not sure how to get my method to convert this model so that I can post it out to application 2 in the XML structure I listed earlier.  p  pSo Im hoping someone out there has done something similar to this project and could shed some lightguidance on working with XSDs in this manner.  The end goal is to take data from application 1, inject it into a new model to meet the required structure for application 2 and then post it out as XML.p  pHopefully the above makes sense and apologies that my approachcoding must look rather backward.  Im not the strongest C programmer as its still quite new to me.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2148 pLets say that I have a servlet running that accepts files of any size from a client applications. The file being sent is loaded into a DataHandler and is transmitted by webservices as such is received and put back into a DataHandler. What happens if the file being sent exceeds the size of available RAM on the receiving hostp  pMy initial thoughts arep  p1The codeJVMcode will just put this in the virtual memory, as the size of the file would already been known through the header messages and the codeJVMcode could be sneaky and allocate the space ahead of time. However, I did not think that the virtual memory space could get to big. p  p2The codeJVMcode will create a hidden file to hold all the data on the hard disk and then the codeDataHandlerscode output stream will just load the data back into the RAM as needed. p  pIn either case it seems like it would be easier to just write the file to the hard disk anyway but I would like to avoid this as I will be using the data immediately after I receive it. The server hosting the codeservletcode will have many different clients all sending large files around the same time and I am wondering how the codeJVMcode will handle issues like this.p

Negative 2148 pWhat is the recommended way to execute a container or pod based on a timebased schedule  For example, a task to run at 2am for 10 minutes every day.  p  pOn a traditional linux server, crontab would easily work, and that obviously still is possible inside the container.  However, since this task only executes for 10 minutes I was looking for a mechanism to execute a basic container on a given time interval, then dispose of of the container.  p  pChronos part of Mesos appears to have a similar behavior, is this possible in Container Enginep

Next we focus only on two columns codeP1code and codeP2code. As you can see in first row we have two names codeAT3G61540code and codeAT4G30920code and thats our starting point loop I believe will be necessary. We put the number 1 in codeClustercode column. Than we take first name codeAT3G61540code and scan through both columns codeP1code and codeP2code if we find this name once again somewhere with other name than in first row we put number 1 as well in codeClustercode. Next we take second name from first row codeAT4G30920code and do the same screening through whole data.  The next step will be to analyze next row and do exactly the same things. In that case in the next row we have exactly the same name for codeP1code that means we dont need to screen it but the second name codeAT4G30910code is different so would be great to screen with that one. The problem which appears here is that this row should be the codecluster 1code as well. The codecluster 2code starts with third row because we have completly new pair of names.p  pI am aware thats not so easy task and probably it has to be done in couple steps.

Negative 2148 pSo Im starting a Monogame project used XNA in the past. I want to make heavy use of sounds, and I want the power to apply immersive effects such as 3D sound, attenuation with distance, the doppler effect, etc. p  pIt would seem that Monogame has got my back. Now, I dont actually know if these features were in XNA, because I only made 2D games before, but the SoundEffect has all kinds of great stuff. I can do 3D sound via calls to Apply3D. Right now, I set the position of every AudioEmitter based on the state of the game world, and I do this for every audio emitter every update step. That seems like the obvious course to me control the position of sounds the same way you would control the position of sprites. That way, I can be sure that every sound is in the correct position at all times.p  pBut Im assuming here that in order to take advantage of the doppler effect, Id have to set the Velocity property of my AudioEmitter. Why would you give an AudioEmitter an independent velocity In a game, these sounds are going to be tied to things I dont see how youd get away with emnotem setting its position every frame.

Negative 2148 pI have a save button that will upload an image to parse. It used to work really well. But for some reason, it stops working. p  pWhen I press the button, nothing happens. As if the code ignored the onClick method. I thought something is wrong with the button or the other objects being saved. So I disabled every single object and found out it works fine when I disabled the image uploading.p  pSo if I disable the image uploading, I can still save the name.

Negative 2148 pIm building a layout using flexbox, and its fairly simple overall. There are three parts of the view a navigation bar at the top, a sidebar on the left, and a content area that fills the remaining space. The navigation bar has a fixed height, and the sidebar has a fixed width.p  pFurthermore, the sidebar and content areas should scroll individually. If the content in the sidebar overflows, it should create a scrollbar specific to the sidebar. The same is true with the content view. Importantly, this means that the overall viewport must never scroll it should remain static only the elements should scroll.p  pBuilding this layout is very simple with flexboxp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodehtml, body    height 100   width 100   body    margin 0   root    display flex   height 100   frame    display flex   flex 1   flexdirection column   navigationbar    backgroundcolor bab   display flex   height 70px   overflow hidden   main    display flex   flex 1   leftbar    backgroundcolor aaa   overflow auto   width 250px   content    backgroundcolor ccc   flex 1 codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv idrootgt   ltdiv idframegt     ltdiv idnavigationbargt       lth1gtWebsite Namelth1gt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idmaingt       ltdiv idleftbargt         lth1gtSome contentlth1gt         lth1gtSome contentlth1gt         lth1gtSome contentlth1gt         lth1gtSome contentlth1gt         lth1gtSome contentlth1gt         lth1gtSome contentlth1gt         lth1gtSome contentlth1gt         lth1gtSome contentlth1gt         lth1gtSome contentlth1gt       ltdivgt       ltdiv idcontentgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgtcodepre div div p  pHowever, notice that the sidebar does emnotem scroll individually.

Such as this posting a hrefhttpscode.google.compgmapsapiissuesissuesdetailid7187 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compgmapsapiissuesissuesdetailid7187a I was wondering if anyone might suggest something to help alleviate this issue. It is hard to replicate but it happens when reloading the parent activity of the view pager, that contains the map view. I would prefer not to designate a large heap as well, since I have seen that does not always solve this problem. Also my primary test Device is an ATT S5 SMG900A. I have not yet been able to replicate it on other devices, which is where this stack trace is from. I have also tested on a 11 in a limited fashion and have not received this error.  I also plan to test it on an S3 when it is available. Thanks.p  pBelow is my stack trace.p  precode0910 095152.973  2688327820com.egovlink EAndroidRuntime FATAL EXCEPTION Thread161927 Process com.egovlink, PID 26883 java.lang.OutOfMemoryError Failed to allocate a 86442 byte allocation with 40103 free bytes and 39KB until OOM         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.k.by.aUnknown Source         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.k.by.aUnknown Source         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.k.by.aUnknown Source         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.k.bl.aUnknown Source         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.l.b.w.cUnknown Source         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.l.d.aUnknown Source         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.l.d.bUnknown Source         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.l.d.aUnknown Source         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.l.g.handleMessageUnknown Source         at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java102         at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java145         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.l.d.runUnknown Source         at com.google.maps.api.android.lib6.gmm6.l.af.runUnknown Source codepre  pHere is my Fragment code.p  precodepublic class MapFragment extends Fragment implements OnMapReadyCallback   private MapView mapView private GoogleMap googleMap private double latitude private double longitude private double userLat private double userLong private static DataManager dataManager  DataManager.getInstance  Override public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState      View view  inflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentmap, container, false      mapView  MapView view.findViewByIdR.id.mapView     mapView.onCreatesavedInstanceState     mapView.onResume        int resultCode  GooglePlayServicesUtil.isGooglePlayServicesAvailablegetActivity      if resultCode  ConnectionResult.SUCCESS            create the map            try              MapsInitializer.initializegetActivity.getApplicationContext          catch Exception e              Log.dMap Error, There was a map error.
