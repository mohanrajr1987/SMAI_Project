Positive 261 pI am port forwarding an FTP and XAMPP server on my home computer. Today, I tried to transfer a MathJax folder more than 30000 files using DreamWeavers put command on FTP and it took nearly an hour. p  pI have seen on the internet that many servers, especially search engines, combine the processing power of multiple machines as well as their memory to create a more powerful server.

Positive 261 pWe are starting a project soon that requires integration to a legacy system. That system requires us to use FTP amp CSV as our communcation protocol and data format. p  pAs were in the design phase, were trying to decide best practices on using FTP. One of the caveats is that we will be passing data backforth fairly frequently every 60 to 120 seconds. Were concerned about collisions where the TO system goes out to find a file and the FROM system is still writing the file, and we may get incomplete data. is this a valid concernp  pTo mitigate this, we figured wed have the file extension be something like .wri while writing, then the last step of the FTP script would rename from .wri to .csv...p  pIn terms of file naming we were going to include a datatime stamp maybe YYYYMMDDHHMISS as part of the file name. We were also going to include the data type and the TO and FROM system as part of the file name... So it might look like ORDERS20150929133559TOLEGACYFROMWEB.csvp  pLove to hear others experience with this, and if theres other things we should be thinking about.p

Positive 261 pI have recently been taking over a websiteproject where I now have a couple of websites to administer. the only problem is that i have to manually go into the ftp in order for me to delete the phpsession files from the tmp in the rootmap. So for instance if our websites are down, usually this means that there are too many session files, and that these must be deleted immediately in order for the sites to get up running normally again. p  pI have contacted the developer who is in charge of the code optimization of the websites, and he have been telling me for a couple of weeks now that this problem should be solved and that he will get to it, but that writing the code for making the session files to delete automatically, is a complicated process and the it takes time. p  pSince I am not a programmer and have very limited knowledge about PHP, I dont really have a clue if this problem is hard to solve or not.

Positive 261 pI have AlwaysON setup in an Azure environment. I was hoping that I could use the listener as my FTP IP address using FileZilla ServerClient. It actually works in regards to using the IP address but when I do a manual failover and connect via the client the files get transferred to Node 1 now secondary instead of Node 2 now primary. p  pI know that I can use an external server for FTP and read from a UNC file path within the same data center but I am also in the process of configuring DR and having another Replica added to the Availability Group and if we do have an event that would trigger a DR failover, I could still use the listener IP and it would be transparent to all our FTP clients.p

Negative 261 pI was reading the Singleton article on Wikipedia and I came across this examplep  precodepublic class Singleton       Private constructor prevents instantiation from other classes     private Singleton              SingletonHolder is loaded on the first execution of Singleton.getInstance        or the first access to SingletonHolder.INSTANCE, not before.           private static class SingletonHolder       private static final Singleton INSTANCE  new Singleton           public static Singleton getInstance      return SingletonHolder.INSTANCE       codepre  pWhile I really like the way this Singleton behaves, I cant see how to adapt it to incorporate arguments to the constructor.  What is the preferred way to do this in Java  Would I have to do something like thisp  precodepublic class Singleton      private static Singleton singleton  null       private final int x      private Singletonint x      this.x  x           public synchronized static Singleton getInstanceint x      ifsingleton  null singleton  new Singletonx     return singleton       codepre  pThanksp  phr p  pEdit  I think I have started a storm of controversy with my desire to use Singleton.  Let me explain my motivation and hopefully someone can suggest a better idea.  I am using a grid computing framework to execute tasks in parallel.  In general, I have something like thisp  precode AbstractTask implements Serializable public class Task extends AbstractTask      private final ReferenceToReallyBigObject object      public TaskReferenceToReallyBigObject object          this.object  object           public void run           Do some stuff with the object which is immutable.       codepre  pWhat happens is that even though I merely pass a reference to my data to all of the tasks, when the tasks are serialized, the data gets copied over and over.  What I want to do is share the object among all of the tasks.  Naturally, I might modify the class like sop  precode AbstractTask implements Serializable public class Task extends AbstractTask      private static ReferenceToReallyBigObject object  null      private final String filePath      public TaskString filePath          this.filePath  filePath           public void run          synchronizedthis          ifobject  null          ObjectReader reader  new ObjectReaderfilePath     object  reader.read                 Do some stuff with the object which is immutable.       codepre  pAs you can see, even here I have the issue that passing a different file path means nothing after the first one is passed.  This is why I like the idea for a emstoreem which was posted in the answers.  Anyhow, rather than including the logic for loading the file in the run method, I wanted to abstract this logic into a Singleton class.  I will not provide yet another example, but I hope you get the idea.  Please let me hear your ideas for a more elegant way to accomplish what I am trying to do.  Thank you againp

Below is a snippet of the schema, and the classes, as well as the schema from the wsdl output.p  pMy problem is that even though I render the xsd for my IXmlSerializable classes, the schema is not included in the wsdl. They are just referenced with codeprocessContentslaxcode. This seems to be a problem for consumers of my services, as they can not use their wizards to create clients.p  pHas anyone encountered this problem Is there anyway to control the wsdl output to avoid this.

Negative 261 pIve written a C library that does some seriously heavy CPU work all of it math and calculations and if left to its own devices, will easily consume 100 of all available CPU resources its also multithreaded to the number of available logical cores on the machine.p  pAs such, I have a callback inside the main calculation loop that software using the library is supposed to callp  precodewhiletrue      do math here     callbackpercentcomplete  codepre  pIn the callback, the client calls Sleepx to slow down the thread.p  pOriginally, the clientside code was a fixed Sleep100 call, but this led to bad unreliable performance because some machines finish the math faster than others, but the sleep is the same on all machines. So now the client checks the system time, and if more than 1 second has passed which  several iterations, it will sleep for half a second.p  pIs this an acceptable way of slowing down a thread Should I be using a semaphoremutex instead of Sleep in order to maximize performance Is sleeping x milliseconds for each 1 second of processing work fine or is there something wrong that Im not noticingp  pThe reason I ask is that the machine still gets heavily bogged down even though taskman shows the process taking up 10 of the CPU.

Negative 261 pI am creating a custom CMS in PHP written from scratch and want to know whether I should store user created pages as files or in a MySQL database.p  pThe content is all HTML code, at least for now.p  pI cannot decide which to do as writing files with php seems like a security risk, and retrieving file contents from MySQL on every page load feels wrong and could be a performance issue.p  pI also have custom pages coded by me for a blog, etc. These contain PHP code but do not need to be modified by the user.

Negative 261 pIm crossfading between two views using UIView animation. Ive noticed the following surprising factp  pIf I have say two identical views in an identical place, and I animate a cross fade between them e.g. animate the alpha from 0.0 to 1.0 on one while going from 1.0 to 0.0 on the other, in the same animation, during the animation, the visible result arcs slightly below opaque during the animation this is a noticeable artifact and can be verified by putting some other view behind the crossfaded views it becomes visible briefly during the animation before being obscured again.p  pI would expect using emanyem animation timing curve that perfectly paired 01 and 10 alpha transitions would always add up to a net alpha of 1.0, and that in this test situation, I should never see any visible change in alpha, yet I do.p  pAny idea whats going on here I could hack around this for a fix, but Im mostly interested in what Im missing conceptually in the blending.p  pThanksp

An example might helpp  precodeMyObject myObject  new MyObject ListltmyAccountgt myAccountsList  new ListltmyAccountgt  myAccountsList.Addnew myAccount AccountNumber  123 myAccountsList.Addnew myAccount AccountNumber  456  myObject.ListOfAccounts  myAccountsList  var accountsQuery  from ax in myObject.ListOfAccounts                     join a in orgContext.CreateQueryltcustomAccountEntitygt on ax.AccountNumber equals a.accountnumber                     select a  foreachvar item in accountsQuery      Console.WriteLineId of record retrieved   a.Id.ToString  codepre  pThe code above compiles and executes, however, the filtering of the records is being performed locally after retrieving the entire CRM entity recordset. Obviously when the CRM entity contains thousands of rows the query will perform poorly or even timeout.p  pI have read about IQueryable and IEnumerable and tried converting the List using the AsQueryable extension method, which had no effect. I need my above Linq query to run SQL like thisp  precodeSELECT a. FROM customAccountEntity AS a WHERE a.accountnumber IN 123, 456 codepre  pOr using a temporary table if wanted to join on multiple fields. How can I accomplish thisp

No, I cant have the main server TS the events as they come in, because thatll require storing an offset when the event actually emhappenedem and when it was logged, which requires a whole lot of extra work, and that complicates matters needlessly.p  pIve currently set up one server as stratum 2 timeserver, using some startum 1 GPS sources as servers in ntp.conf, on the other servers, Ive set this server to be the sole server in ntp.conf.p  pI hope this will be enough.

I then renamed the implementation class codeService1.cscode with the name of the implementationclass codeJINDEXWcfListener.cscode. I removed the generated code from this class and created class definition codeJINDEXWcfListener[interface name]code.p  pThe tool autogenerated the implementation of the interface. I used the single method adorned with code[OperationContractAttribute]code to put my local implementation code. I modified the default codeapp.configcode generated to adjust the contract and service names as required.p  pWhen I start debug, I can see that the service is starting in the WTC. However, when the single operation is exposed, the is a red dot with a yellow question mark in front of the operation name.

Negative 261 pI am currently making a Facelets page with JSF2.0 and I am using Primefaces to make it look fancy D. But I have a problem which I cant seem to solve. The idea behind my page is the following  I have a dashboard page which contains different accordion tabs and in each tab there is a primefaces datatable. In that datatable are some rows for a given user. But when I want to add a new row to my datatable I use the following method. I have a button Add row beneath my datatable and when I click it I load through JQuery a page into a div thats beneath my button. In that div is then my addrow page loaded with the validation and so on.p  pBut here is the problem when I click on my add button on the included page, I want to update my datatable in the parent page, so the page that includes my add page, and this is not working as the update attribute for my pcommandButton doesnt seem to find the datatable or any other component on my parent page.p  pSo if someone could tell me how that I could update my component in my parent page p  pHere is the related code fragments  strongParent page which includes the add page in the content divstrongp  precode

The user can fill a form and makes a POST request to the same page with parameter codeFiltercode set. But I dont want to miss the parameter codeStationNrcode thus I thought I give it into a hidden input field. But then the parameter codeStationNrcode is either in the codeGETcode variable first call or in the codePOSTcode variable second call. I can do something likep  precodeif issetGET[StationNr]     snr  GET[StationNr] else if issetPOST[StationNr]     nr  POST[StationNr] codepre  pBut I dont like this.

With one of them, I was able to make a separate window popup and disappear. What I am trying to do with the second one is this...p  pI have a MainWindow with a button, and when that button is pressed, the CentralWidget changes to the QWidget with another button. Then, when I press a button on the new button, it restores the CentralWidget to the original one. p  pI did try storing the initial CentralWidget before changing it but I have yet to be able to successfully restore it.

Negative 261 pI am working on something similar to a canvas, users can add drag labels onto a view, resize them and whatnot.p  pMy Question for you is What do you think is the best way to load these labels programatically p  pThis may sound foolish at first but I do not know how many labels there will be, so I do not want to hardcode n Labels and find the user uses n200, if you see what I mean I am aware that it is simplistic to dop  precodeUILabel myLabel  [[UILabel alloc] init] codepre  pbut then I have one label called myLabel, is there any way to programatically name these variables As we all know we cannot have more than variable with the same name.p  pAn example may help User drags on 2 labels, saves this view. I come to load it later, programatically. What is the best way to create and name these 2 labels, having no prior knowledge of how many labels there were i.e. cannot be hardcoded.p  pI am aware this is a shoddy explanation but, if someone can wade through my crap and see the question, please add your 2 centsp
Negative 261 pI am making an app that parses an RSS Feed into a SQLite database which is then read from to populate a list of posts. The database is there so that even without a connection, the user can view posts that have been retrieved earlier.p  pI have put all the parsing into a trycatch however, when it catches the exception, the application crashes. Is there a way to gracefully handle this exception so it just skips to reading what is in the database I have looked into using codeSocketExceptioncode and codeXmlPullParserExceptioncode, but these either bring more errors or dont affect the problem.p
Negative 261 pMy problem lies a hrefhttpuntruth.webs.comnotesfolder.htm relnofollowherea. My goal is to have the first set of divs, the notebook, always on the left of the page. This was easily accomplished. But now, trying to get the other set, the folder, to align to right right of the page and also display beside the notebook is a bit tricky. p  pSo far the closest I have gotten to my goal is using absolute positioning. This would be fine except it causes a few problems. For example, the folder is ALWAYS linked to the right, which leads to problems when the window is resized narrowly. I doubt this is fixable using absolute positioning, but its the best I could get.p  pPlease help suggest better ways of doing this that actually work. So far Ive tried other types of positioning, inline displaying, spans, and what not.  Im not much used to using spans and possibly could have just used them wrong.p

Negative 261 pBest case scenario  Just modify  the urlpatterns of one of them to include the urlpatterns of the other.  p  pBut as of now they both have seperate settings.py, seperate DBs, seperate directories.

Can I somehow just have one invoke the other through urls.py and forego all the above.  Any website documentation covering all this in detail, thats the main thing.  Sorry if this has been asked.

Im using Csharps framework for serialization so when I deserialize the class C, the framework creates a new instance of all in objects rooted at C shown in the diagram by the new classes. Now Id like to replace As instance of C with Cnew but the problem is that B1 and B2 still point to the old D1 and D2. It would be nice to not have to reinitialize B2 and B2s dependencies.p  pI am looking for a way to have B1 and B2 be able to access D1 and D2 through A without giving them access to C or to each other.

Negative 261 pIm writing an app similar to app protector  it prompts the user to authenticate himself when a protected app is launched. Since Android doesnt provide a way to use BroadcastReceiver on explicit intents, Im detecting app launches by monitoring logcat. For most apps, Im listening for something like Starting activity... and then throwing an intent to my own authentication activity.p  pHowever, there seems to be a loophole in this when a protected app A is launched via another App B. App A is only launched onceand hence will only have one Starting activity... entry in logcat, and if I switch to App B from my activity, it will reroute to App A, and this time, I wont be able to detect it since logcat doesnt show its launch.p  pAn example would be package installer being a protected app, and a file manager launching package installer upon tapping an apk file. While my authentication activity is called up the first time, if I switch to the file manager again, it will automatically display package installer, and this time my app doesnt detect it.p  pIve tried a few app protector apps such as App Protector Lite and Smart App Protector, and they dont seem to have this problem. They have similar permissions as well  GETTASKS, READLOGS, RECEIVEBOOTCOMPLETED, and SYSTEMALERTWINDOW. Does anyone know what can be done to solve my problemp  pThanks.p

Negative 261 pMy company makes desktop software and we want to create an iPhone app that will be a free addon for our customers.

Im also not asking about the max app size allowed when submitting to the app store. I am simply asking about whether my app risks rejection because of the necessity to download so much data upon first launch in order for the app to function. And if there is indeed a risk of rejection, what steps may be taken to mitigate this riskp

Negative 261 pI have ignored javascript forever. I started using jQuery a few years back so I could get by. But as Ive started doing TDD more I decided yesterday to really dive into javascript and possibly coffeescript after that.p  pIn my ASP.NET Web Forms application I have many pages and currently most of those pages do not have a ton of javascript. Im in the process of changing that. Im using Jasmine with Chutzpah to create my tests.p  pI was moving along with my tests passing and failing as expected. But then I wanted to create a namespace so I wouldnt be trampling all over global space.p  pAfter reading this article a hrefhttpenterprisejquery.com201010howgoodchabitscanencouragebadjavascripthabitspart1 relnofollowhttpenterprisejquery.com201010howgoodchabitscanencouragebadjavascripthabitspart1ap  pI decided to try and use the pattern from the SelfExecuting Anonymous Function Part 2 Public amp Private section of the article.  It appears to have the most flexibility and appears to encapsulate things very well.p  pI have a folder called Scripts.  Under that folder are some of the frameworks Im using like jQuery, jasmine, twitter bootstrap and modernizr.  I also have a subfolder called Site where I am putting my code for the site in multiple files based on the page.  product.js, billing.js, etc. p  pUnder ScriptsSite I added a subfolder to Tests or Specs that have the files producttest.js, billingtests.js, etc..p  pWithout having namespaces everything is fine. I have a utility.js file I created with a empadLeftem helper function. I then used that global padLeft in another .js file.  My tests all worked and I was happy. I then decided to figure out the namespace and changed my ScriptsSiteutility.js to look likep  precodefunction myns, , undefined      private property     var isSomething  true      public property     myns.something  something      public method     myns.padLeft  function str, len, pad          str  Arraylen  1  str.length.joinpad  str          return str            check to see if myns exists in global space     if not, assign it a new Object Literal window.myns window.myns , jQuery  codepre  pThen in my ScriptsSiteTestsutilitytest.js I havep  precode ltreference path..utility.js gt  describeNamespace myns with public property something, function       itShould Equal something, function           expectmyns.something.toEqualsomething       codepre  pWith this extremely simple test I was expecting myns.something to come back with the string value of something.  p  pIt doesnt.

The most help came from the commenter T.J. Crowder.  I didnt know the jsbin tool existed and after being convinced that the code I put above was put into the tool and the results were right I knew something had to be off in my environment.p  pThe link in the accepted answer also helped me out a lot. After seeing that the syntax and logic was consistent and working I just had to determine what was off about my setup. Im embarrassed to say it was me passing in jQuery but in my test harness where I was trying to get this to work I wasnt actually using jQuery.  This meant the module wasnt actually being loaded  so myns was never set.p  pThanks everyone. Hopefully this may be helpful to someone in the future.  If you use the above make sure you include the jQuery object.  The other option is to not pass in jQuery and remove the  from the param list. p

Negative 261 pIm looking for a way to create shortcuts in java for WinXP, Vista, and Win7. In addition to the shortcut itself, I need to be able to specify the icon of the shortcut.p  pThe solution can use command line commands, however I cannot use a solution that is GPL. p  pIf WinXP creates shortcuts differently than Vista7, than Im okay with adding conditional logic Ill just need to know how to do it for both cases.p  h2Backgroundh2  pThe shortcut creation will happen during the install process. The installer we are using is Java based, which is why Im looking for the solution in Java. So it is important to note that the shortcut can vary, based on the users selected install directory.

I would prefer a simpler solution though.p

Negative 261 pIm in need of some desperate help. Ive been at this for 4 hours, and Im getting pretty worn out.  Heres my situationp  pI have a Javascript application that is making a POST request using jQuery .post to an external site. On the external site I have Apache Camel running with Jetty to expose it to the web. The web services I wrote in Camel expect JSON data for all of the requests. For instance, one request needs an id, so I send it codeid 10code.p  pHeres my issue it doesnt work from Javascript. I have a few different tools that will send post requests for me like the Poster extension for browsers. If I use Poster and set the body to codeid 10code, it works just fine. I get that exact string in the service.p  pBut, if I post from Javascript, I get something different. Posting the JSON object will give me the string id10 on my service side. Its OK for this scenario, but I will need actual JSON objects eventually. If I stringify the JSON object, I get the JSON string, only all of the characters are escaped. Ex. 7Bid33....p  pI swear Ive tried every method possible for posting the data, but I either get the weird already parsed JSON, or the escaped string or nothing at all. Is there some way I can have Javascript NOT parse the JSON object and just send it like my posting tool does If not, is there a safe, efficient way to unescape the JSON string that I getp  pI really appreciate any help.p

I hit the first problem there may be more during the very first step. After trying to figure out how to get the SPIisWebServiceApplicationPool from C on my own for a while, I decompiled Microsoft.SharePoint.Powershell to see how the GetSPServiceApplicationPool cmdlet is implemented and its done by accessing SPIisWebApplicationSettings in the Microsoft.SharePoint assembly. It uses the SPIisWebApplicationSettings.Default.ApplicationPools enumeration. That class is marked internal and access to it is allowed from the Microsoft.SharePoint.Powershell assembly by the inclusion of an InternalsVisibleTo attribute on the Microsoft.SharePoint assembly.p  pSo, without hacking and recompiling the Microsoft.SharePoint assembly to give my assembly InternalsVisibleTo access and without hosting PowerShell within my feature, how can I check if the SPIisWebServiceApplicationPool exists, remove it if it does and then create a new SPIisWebServiceApplicationPool Also, using reflection to get access to the internal classes isnt prefered... Im looking for what Im missing in the SharePoint API that will let me do this.p
Negative 261 pIm building my EF v4.0.30319 data model from my SQL Server database. Each table has codeCreatedcode and codeUpdatedcode fields populated via database triggers.p  pThis database is the backend of a ASP.NET Web API application and I recently discovered a problem. The problem is, since the codeCreatedcode and codeUpdatedcode fields are not populated in the model passed into the api endpoint, they are written to the database as codeNULLcode. This overwrites any values already in the database for those properties.p  pI discovered I can edit the EF data model and just delete those two columns from the entity. It works and the datetimes are not overwritten with codeNULLcode. But this leads to another, less serious but more annoying, problem... my data model has a bunch of tables that contain these properties and all the tables need to be updated by removing these two columns.p  pIs there a way to tell EF to ignore certain columns in entities across the entire data model without manually deleting themp

Negative 261 pIm trying to use the ValueInjector latest version from NuGet to inject my view model with data from my EntityFramework Code First object. Ill want to do the reverse of this as well, but this is the attempt Im starting with.p  pIve researched the various mappings and have tried many of them. I havent found one that does what I need and I think my need is a rather basic one there are several of these questions on SO and each seems to get a different answer, which is fine..p  pIve really tried to do my due diligence on this. Ive googled and trolled CodePlex and downloaded the ProDinner application got it up and running and stepped through the code in debug. p  pIm at a point where I have my own ValueInjection class to handle the injecton. Im about to paste my code and objects in a pretty friendly way so you can grab and run them. Mind you I have a solution that uses the base LoopValueInjection, but I dont like it because itd require manual plumbing for injections going from entity to mapping and then mapping to entity. The ProDinner example had a more templated approach, which I liked, but I couldnt adapt it to my needs.p  pI think where my code is messing up logic wise is that I dont understand how to force a recursive injection to occur if the source property type is not a simple object. In this example, the Person.Address. properties will match by name and type those on the PersonViewModel class however, the injection loops over the properties on Person and tries to match on the name and type of the Person.Address property. p  pI thought the linep  precode        Object result  Activator.CreateInstancec.SourceProp.Type             .InjectFromltCloneInjectiongtc.SourceProp.Value codepre  pWould perform this recursion, but I dont think it does.p  pSo...Can anyone give me any direction on how to fix thisp  precode  ENTITY MODELS  public class Person      public int Id  get set      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set      public virtual Address Address  get set    public class Address      public int Id  get set      public string City  get set      public string State  get set      public string Zip  get set      VIEW MODEL   public class PersonViewModel      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set      public int PersonId  get set      public int AddressId  get set      public string City  get set      public string State  get set      public string Zip  get set         CUSTOM INJECTOR public class EntityToViewModel  ConventionInjection       protected override bool MatchConventionInfo c              ignore int  0 and DateTime  to 1010001         if c.SourceProp.Type  typeofDateTime ampamp DateTimec.SourceProp.Value  defaultDateTime              c.SourceProp.Type  typeofint ampamp intc.SourceProp.Value  defaultint             return false          if c.SourceProp.Name  c.TargetProp.Name ampamp c.SourceProp.Value  null             return true          if c.SourceProp.Type  typeofint ampamp             c.TargetProp.Type  typeofint                       if id.Equalsc.SourceProp.Name.ToLower ampamp                                  c.TargetProp.Name.ToLower.EndsWithid ampamp                 c.TargetProp.Name.StartsWithc.Source.Type.Name             return true                   Transition logic to SetValue for value types.

To be clear if I just type the command, I receive the same thing, rather than terminal returning the manual for the command. Ive tried locate and whereis and have only been able to find a single reference to it at usrsharemanman1mdcheckschema.1 Has the command been moved or removed all together The apple docs still suggest it should be in usrbin.

Negative 261 pI am writing a web application in Visual Studio 2010 using C.

Negative 261 pThis isnt really a Haskell question at all, but I imagine there are a lot of people following the Haskell tag who will know the answer to this...p  pIm currently trying to wrap my brain around how you can hold a functions inputs emandem outputs emandem local variables emandem temporary values all on the same stack, yet end up with the correct stack layout on exit.p  pUsually a emstackem provides Push and Pull operations, which modify the topmost stack item only. Sometimes youre also allowed random read access to items further down the stack. That explains how you can keep variables there and randomaccess them. But usually the only way to change the size of the stack is to Pull items off it. Thats not much good if you want to keep the item on top of the stack and delete stuff below it.p  pHow do real compilers do this stuffp

Negative 261 pI have a console app at the moment, which monitors a folder for files, and then based on rules and the file name, copies any new file to a location on the network.p  pI have a requirement to make the application more pretty, so decided to go with a simple WinForms single form application which displays status and last updated file type information.p  pThe console app was written in such a way that all Console display information went through a single method, which I called Notify, taking two parameters. A string to display the information I want the user to see, and an ErrorLevel Enum, which, if Normal displayed in green text, if Warning, was yellow, and if error, was red. But the point is, all my code just did was use the Notify method to output any text.p  pI want to change my console app into a normal class, run it as a background worker from the WinForms project, and have the Notify method in the thread send updates to the winforms app, safely. I think it can be done with events, but I am not sure what would be the best way to handle this. Could you propose a method to get this working p  pTheres the Invoke way of doing things. Is it good Something likep  precodethis.BeginInvoke new MethodInvoker gt UpdateLabels codepre  pIt seems it would be basic, but Id like to still make use of my Notify method, and have that send messages to the UI layer.p  pI also need the console app to send messages to the thread. For example, Stop, where I then run code that gracefully quits the thread... and also, Refresh, which does some logic within the thread.p  pAnother option is to run the processing class as a service And then have a UI that somehow connects to the system service and gets updates I have never done anything like that, but the process is meant to run all the time...p  pAt the moment, I have my code running, but no updated to the UIp  precodepublic partial class MainForm  Form      BackgroundWorker bw  new BackgroundWorker     public MainForm              InitializeComponent           private void MainFormLoadobject sender, EventArgs e               bw.DoWork  bwDoWork         bw.RunWorkerAsync           private void bwDoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e              var bw  sender as BackgroundWorker         var monitor  new Monitor         monitor.RunMe        codepre  pI think I just need to find a way to get my Notify method in my thread to send a message or something An object that I create, with Message String and ErrorCode properties back to my UI, and process it safely on the UI.p  pAnd here is the code within the class thread...p  precodepublic class Monitor              public void RunMe                      NotifyChecking for network connectivity..., Constants.ErrorLevel.Information             if FileManagement.FolderExistsConstants.FolderToMonitor  false                              NotifyUnable to monitor folder  Aborting., Constants.ErrorLevel.Error                 Console.ReadKey                 return                          NotifyOK, Constants.ErrorLevel.Information ....  codepre  pNote Readkey will be removed..p

Another issue is that even in the SUM loop if use CC instead of C1CX where X is however many rows, it crashes excel or takes forever to loop through. Im guessing its because excel doesnt know when to stop in a UDF unless I somehow tell it top

Negative 261 pTrying to decide between the two for an asp.net mvc singlepage application.  One thing I cant seem to find out about TypeScript is if can I reference a TypeScript class server side, for example in a controller or model.  I tried it but it doesnt seem to work.p  pIve tried SharpScript Script and I love that I can code a class in C, and now from one single file, I have access to that class ServerSide and ClientSide since Script converts the C class into a javascript file automatically.  This makes it easy to have one single class that I can use to populate a model,  then use it with HtmlHelpers to setup a view, web api uses it to return json, and then clientside, reference the model via javascript for all my clientside stuff. I dont have to code two different files for each end.p  pDoes Typescript offer this also  Or is Typescript only for client side usep  pIm wondering if I need both  I use Script for those classes I want access to from both ends and I use TypeScript for the clientside browser only logic.p  pEDIT 1  Turns out I was actually using something called SharpKit in another project. That is what was generating my javascript files from C and allowing me to use one single C class at both ends.  As soon as I add Script via nuget to my test asp.net mvc project, it stops compiling.p  pFINAL DECISION  Not going to use Script.  No support. No docs.  Cant even compile my app with it. Not worth troubleshooting if its just another variation of what TypeScript is. Also not going to bother trying to use TypeScript server side either via TypeLITE since theres really no support or anybody using that TypeLITE either. Plus, I want to be able to have a single C class with a string property that gets auto mapped to a javascript knockout observable and it seems like SharpKit is the only thing that can handle this.p  pLooks like SharpKit is really what I want to stick with since it does everything I want, keeps me in C even better, and has a lot of support.  Just need to hope I dont hit the 5000line limit and then need to buy it.  Maybe I will give TypeScript a shot, but it seems like once I am using SharpKit, I dont really gain anything with TypeScript.p

Negative 261 pI am working on developing some code for an embedded application.

Negative 261 pI stumbled upon the imho rather poorly documented fact that by default PHP PDO has the flag codeMYSQLATTRDIRECTQUERYcode enabled for its MySQL driver.p  pThis means rather than actually use prepared statements, it emulates the behaviour of prepared statements. This means it replaces the placeholders clientside with escaped values and just sends the full query to the database asis.p  pThere used to be a good reason to do this, as under older versions of MySQL prepared statements would bypass the query cache. But this hasnt been the case for a while now. Theres still a slight performance advantage, as it reduces the number of roundtrips from your app to the database, but Im not sure thats worth itp  pThe obvious downside to using this method is that were still relying on clientside escaping, which is usually a bad idea. Ive run into weird issues with codemysqlirealescapestringcode in the past where invalid characters were allowed into a query due to some character set misconfiguration. Id rather not have something like that happen again.p  pIm only finding halftruths and superficial comments on this issue e.g. yeah, you can enable that or itll cause issues. Looking for a real reason why I wouldnt switch this off Is using actual prepared statements in MySQLPDO in anyway incompatible with emulated prepared statements p  pPart of the reason why Im asking is because we use PHPActiverecord, which relies on PDO. It doesnt ship with tests and I dont want it to suddenly break in production because switching off emulated prepared statements subtly changes behaviour in certain edge cases or something.p  pas a sidenote, before anyone brings it up checking codePDOATTREMULATEPREPAREScode wont work as its not actually fully implemented for the MySQL driver, you have to check codePDOMYSQLATTRDIRECTQUERYcode instead. Yeah, that one took me a while.p  pTo clarify I am wondering if there is a good reason to strongNOTstrong switch off this behaviour. Not reasons why I shouldnt be caring in the first place.p

Negative 261 pI am new to Symfony2, but having a good time with it so far. I am attempting to design a tool that will generate contracts for us, based on input provided by the sales representative. The sales rep will choose a service on the form, and then enter the negotiated price.p  pI have three types of entities.p  precodeContracts id, name ContractServicecontractid, serviceid, adjustedPrice Serviceid, name codepre  pI build my forms service field using the codeentitycode type to create a dropdownselect containing all of the possible services. However, I get an error when the form is submitted, because the ContractsetService expects a codeContractServicecode entity, but the form returns a codeServicecode type.p  pSo I created a listener with a prePersist condition that executes a method that accepts a codeServicecode entity, and a codeContractcode entity, and returns a codeContractServicecode entity.p  pI believe at this point I need to somehow swap the newly created codeContractServicecode in for the codeServicecode entity that the form returns, but I am not sure how to do that. It also seems like there may be a better way for going about this. Any help is appreciated, and if you need code examples or anything please let me know.p

Negative 261 pIm building a CakePHP application. The code is structured logically so that each controller is considered its own mini application. p  pIm using jQuery for all my JavaScript functionality. p  pMy question is what is the right way to structure the JavaScript so that only the pages that require it have it p  pShould I have separate js files per app. That way App 1 will have app1.js included in all of its views, App 2 will have only app2.js and so on.

Negative 261 pI am trying to implement a DICOM proxy server using WCF. That it is DICOM isnt really important, except that it forces me to use a particular process for getting image files Under DICOM, you set up a listener on a well known IPAddressPort which is registered with an ID AETITLE on a server. You then send a query to that server, and at some time in the future or maybe never the server sends the image file directly to your listener.p  pMy listener will be a method on the proxy, that will receive the DICOM file.p  pThe proxy will work using WCF, receiving requests from the desktop client. In this case, the desktop client will send a request to the proxy using WCF, for a particular study UID a GUID for the file from the actual server, I am then happy to have that thread block for a reply from the proxy until the file arrives at the listener, I might also, eventually, use callbacks  but the same problem applies.p  pSop  precodeClient                 Proxy                  DICOM Server                          RegisterListenergt                           RequestStudyIDgt                         Request StudyIDgt                                                                            ltSendDICOM ltReturnDICOM codepre  pIs there a pattern or example I can use to implement this I assume I need to register a pointer delegate to the client making the request, so the proxy knows which client to return the image to when the listener gets the file from the DICOM server Can I make a dictionary of StudyUID, ListOf Delegate or some similar structure to get this to work will be ListOf Delegate as their could be multiple clients requesting the same studyp  pOr is it better to just have the proxy thread watch a shared dictionary and wait until that entry is populated with the file ie have a shared dictionary of StudyID, DICOMFile that is monitored by the clients requesting thread and populated by the proxy listener This would preclude me from using Async Callbacks though.p  pAny suggestions welcome. Hopefully this isnt too vague...p

Negative 261 pApple documentation says we need to register for codeNSUbiquityIdentityDidChangeNotificationcode and to compare the current iCloud token with the one previously stored in codeNSUserDefaultscode to detect if a user disabled iCloud from strongemDocuments amp Data Settingsemstrong or switched to another iCloud account.p  pI use a standard codeUIManagedDocumentcode and I target iOS 7 so the fallback store is handled automatically by CoreData. p  pI do not understand what I should do after I find the user enabled  disabled iCloud or switched to another account.

I can probably work around that but Id see it as a last resort rather than the fix.p  pIm looking at using the HasNavigationPropertyLink method for the User property but I dont really understand how it works yet.p  pEdit Okay, Ive got my navigation property link created....p  precodevar noteConfig  edmxModelBuilder.EntitySetltEF.JobNotegtJobNotes  IEdmModel edmxModel  edmxModelBuilder.GetEdmModel     noteConfig.HasNavigationPropertyLink        noteConfig.EntityType.NavigationProperties.Singlex gt x.Name  User,        entityContext, navigationProperty gt            new UrientityContext.Url.ODataLink                new EntitySetPathSegmentUsers,                new KeyValuePathSegmententityContext.EntityInstance.Id.ToString,                new NavigationPathSegmentnavigationProperty.Name,        false codepre  p... but its giving me the same issue. I presume thats because Im updating the configuration after Ive already built the model but I cant rebuild and reassign it.p

Negative 261 pI have a graph of the dependencies of all tasks, and the costs of each task. Now I want to calculate a scheduling for a given amount of CPUs. Ive found many papers on scheduling algorithms, optimal schedulers seem to be too expensive for my problem size around 100 nodes as its an NPhard problem. Id settle for a heuristic, preferably one that has a bound how close it gets to the optimum. My problem now is do I really have to code it myself This should have been solved many times before, it can be easily applied to project management, maybe there something existsp  pIf you happen to know a library in python thatd be perfect or the next best thing would be C, otherwise id settle for anything else.p

Negative 261 pWorking on writing a deceptively simple function that finds the accumulation of things. It is quite abstract, and its signature is thisp  precodedef accumulatecombiner, start, n, term     Return the result of combining the first n terms in a sequence.      YOUR CODE HERE  codepre  pMore about this questionp  pAccumulate takes as arguments the same arguments term and n as summation and product, together with a combiner function of two arguments that specifies how the current term is to be combined with the accumulation of the preceding terms and a start value that specifies what base value to use to start the accumulation. from UC Berkeley CS61A Fall 2013, John DeNerop  pCombiner refers to the way that the terms from start to n will be accumulated could be add, sub, mul, etc.. Combiner takes 2 arguments max.p  pTerm refers to the function that is applied to each term beginning with start and ending with n. This could mean taking the square, sqrt, n2, of each term.p  pI want to approach this problem without having to use functools.reduce. p  pI know I have to make a loop of function compositions, but this is the part that confuses me. And then, I have to have each function take two arguments the old accumulation and the current term.p  pI have worked on this for 2 days, and have confused my self a bunch, so my code is messed up. Any suggestionsp  precodedef accumulatecombiner, start, n, term     Return the result of combining the first n terms in a sequence.     now0     while startnow1ltn         def combinerx,y                 oldcombinerstartnow,startnow1                 oldcombinerold,start                 now1     return old codepre  pThe startnow1 refers to the fact that I cant start performing the combiner function on termn until I have at least term of n. But then I become confused because I have to keep combining the last 2 values while storing the old sum and updating it.p

The only way to synchronise that I would see is to call it like service.doSomething.then ..... This would imply the caller needs to know that a promise is returned.p  pIs there any way to wait inside doSomething method until the promise is resolved and ONLY then returnp

Negative 261 pIs there a way to encryptdecrypt data using publickeyprivatekey rather than the RSA encryptionp  pBecause it gives different results for the same string every timep  pWhat I want is to store some sensitive data in my website and as they are sensitive I want to encrypt them before I store them and the only thing I will need to use the stored data is for comparison purposes only. At the same time I want the data to be recoverable with a key that is not stored in anywhere in the website.p  pTherefore, I come up with the idea of encrypting data using a publickey that is saved in the website And keep the privatekey saved in another place. And whenever I want to compare them I will compare the encrypted data whether the match.p  pBut the problem is encrypting data using the RSA publickey produces different encryption each time, as I mentioned earlier.p
Negative 261 pI have a ServiceStack 3based clientserver architecture.

Negative 261 pI am trying to port OpenGL 1.x code a hrefhttpsgithub.combenrichards86Tetris relnofollowherea original code is written by a a hrefhttpsuperuser.comSuper Usera regular, a hrefhttpsuperuser.comusers33595benrichardsBenRichardsa to the WebGLsafe subset of OpenGL 2.x. My plan is to compile the code using a hrefhttpsgithub.comkripkenemscripten relnofollowEmscriptena so that this CSDL app runs as JSWebGL in a modern browser, but to achieve that, I must eliminate the use of the GL 1.x API, since Emscripten is not properly supporting the GL 1.x code that we are using with its imperfectbroken 1.x emulation code. BenRichards is also interested in seeing his newbie GL 1.x code forwardported to a more modern GL API, as long as it runs on both the desktop and in the browser.p  pBoth BenRichards and myself are newish to OpenGL in general, so we have a lot of learning to do in order to understand how to forwardport it. The general approach seems to be to avoid clientside data for performance reasons see a hrefhttpsgithub.comkripkenemscriptenwikiOpenGLsupport relnofollowherea, but I wanted to learn by example.p  pTake this little snippet from a hrefhttpsgithub.combenrichards86TetrisblobmasterTCell.cpp relnofollowherea for examplep  precodevoid TCellOnRender    glPushMatrix   glColor3ubcolor.red, color.green, color.blue    glBeginGLQUADS   glVertex2i20  column  40, 20  row  40   glVertex2i20  column  20, 20  row  40   glVertex2i20  column  20, 20  row  20   glVertex2i20  column  40, 20  row  20   glEnd   ....   glPopMatrix  codepre  pIf someone could write a heavily commented port of this general rendering pattern into WebGLish code still C though, not JavaScript, that would be great. This should provide me a starting point to port the remainder of the app.p  pA good answer to this question will be generally useful beyond the immediate problem I am facing, by explaining the thought process of how to translate this type of immediatemode GL 1.x code into the deferred rendering model of GL 2.x. External references to blogs, guides, etc. are welcomeencouraged.p

Negative 261 pI have a set of base steps in SpecFlow that do simple things like enter text and validate fields. I want so that these base steps can be used by non technical testers in creating higher level steps made out of these base steps. They should not need to know how to code or how to implement step definitions or how to use selenium at all. All they need to do is define a step in English that calls other base steps. Then they can repeat the process and make more steps out of the ones they just defined. This how I want automation to occur where I am so that non technical testers can create tests in English only, while coding can be done by someone else.p  pDoes SpecFlow support this From what I can see you can define a step to use other steps in code in the step definition bindings, but I cant see where you do something like this in the feature file itself, so no code is involved Tools like Fitnesse are very good when offering this kind of functionality.p  pMany Thanks.p

Negative 261 pI created a carousel with React.js, it was simple until I arrived at the animation problem. The carousel is classic, it is composed of slides of content, of small bullets indicating the current slide, and of small thumbnails for navigating between the slide.p  pThe carousel component is datadriven, meaning that it is passed its content as a javascript array of objects. Each slide is a codelicode tag within a codeulcode, and just have to change the codemarginleftcode css property of the codeulcode to move from one slide to another.p  pIm wondering if I should use the codeReactTransitionGroupcode or codeReactCSSTransitionGroupcode to animate the transition from one slide to another. Basically the transition is a sliding effect from left to right when going from one slide to another.p  pMy understanding is that the codeReactTransitionGroupcodes API is helpful when adding or removing some content. Here I wont addremove any slide, change changing the visible one with an animation.p  pMy difficulty wrapping my head around this is that I developped a static aka without animation carousel where the currently displayed slide is the only state saved in the component. This state is just the index of the slide in the array of slides. So when I click a thumbnail to navigate slide number codencode, the only thing I do is updating this internal state, then the rendering takes care of setting the codeleftcode style property based on this index.p  pI dont see how I can add animation to this carousel. Any helphint greatly appreciated.p

Negative 261 pApologies if this question has been asked previously.p  pI have a ListFragment that contains a Button in each list item. Clicking on the Button should change the background color of that particular list item. I understand that the ListView inside the ListFragment refreshes itself implying that if a user scrolls it is likely that a list item that was not previously clicked will have its background color changed. p  pMany of the solutions I have come across involve storing the position of the list item that was clicked in an overridden getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent method implemented in a custom adapter that extends SimpleAdapter in my case. p  pHowever my problem is compounded by the presence of a Button inside every list item implying  that the Button will not be clickable unless I attach an OnClickListener inside a custom adapter this part is done. Now, trying to store the position of the Buttons list item fails because the saved position is always a refreshed position and not the absolute position of the list item. I also tried setting tags for each button but even those get recycled as the page scrolls, which is unfortunately expected behaviour considering the design of ListView.p  pI understand that this problem is easily solvable if the a list item does not have children that need to be clicked. But what if there are children within every list item that need to respond to clicks separate from the parent view that contains each list item  I have also tried using selectors to manipulate a list items background but that hasnt helped either.p  pHere is my Custom Adapters getView methodp  precodeOverride public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent      View view  convertView     final int pos  position      ifview  null          LayoutInflater inflater  LayoutInflater context.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE         view  inflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentlayout, null          Button button  Button view.findViewByIdR.id.button         button.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener               Override             public void onClickView v                   Log.dCLICKED POSITION,Integer.valueOfpos.toString                 View parent  View v.getParent                  parent.setBackgroundColorColor.GREEN                                    return view  codepre  pAnd the XML layout filep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidlayoutwidth300dp androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidorientationvertical  androidlayoutweight1 androiddescendantFocusabilityblocksDescendants androidlayoutmargin5dp  gt  ltListView androidididandroidlist     androidlayoutwidthfillparent      androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   gt       ltTextView         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidtextstringlabel          androidlayoutgravitystart     gt      ltTextView          androidididtextid         androidlayoutwidth0dp         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent          androidlayoutweight1         androidlayoutgravityend     gt       ltButton          androidididbutton          androidlayoutheightwrapcontent          androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent          androidtextstringbutton          androidlayoutmargin2dp          androidlayoutmarginLeft2dp          androidlayoutmarginRight2dp          androidclickabletrue        gt   ltLinearLayoutgt  codepre  pI have spent many hours on this problem and I am unable to arrive at a solution.

Or should i write the fedauth coockie somewhere on disk where Excel can find it  p

Negative 261 pTrying my best to wrap my head around wordpress search process and results. Been reading and researching online for about 8 hours straight at this stage and have gotten almost nowhere.p  pI have a completely custom theme, designed by a friend for a client.  I have a search box in a nav bar at the top of the page, inside the header.  Id like the user to be able to search the sites content from that search box in the nav bar at any time.  Ive found plenty of examples of this being accomplished on other pages, though they often seem to be using a readymade theme.p  pEventually Id like to be able to understand whats going in the search.php file well enough to edit it along with the searchform.php file so that the search box and results appear unified with the rest of the theme.p  pAt the moment the closest Ive gotten to having anything functioning at all is the inclusion of a quantity of search results showing the appropriate number of hits expected, but I still can not figure out how to display a result.p  pIve been combing through others page sources and every hit I can google about customising or just explaining the search.php file, and yet all I keep finding is read the Creating a Search Page and it must be a theme issue.  This is not gainful information.p  pMy understanding of whats being taught in the Creating a Search Page info is that it describes the steps for creating a custom search page that one can hyperlink  permalink to, but which is unrelated to the default search function within the wordpress kit.  Indeed, Ive successfully created a custom search page, but it behaves simply as a standalone page, and is not related to a customised search results page.  To customise the look of default search function results, I understand the search.php file must be edited.  So far the what to edit within that file escapes me, but for now Id just like to understand why I am seeing the correct number of results, but no actual results.p  pMy search.php file looks like thisp  precodeltphp getheader gt  THIS IS THE TOP OF SEARCH.PHP      ltsection idprimary classcontentareagt         ltdiv idcontent classsitecontent rolemaingt              ltphp if  haveposts   gt              ltheader classpageheadergt                 lth1 classsearchtitlegt                     ltphp echo wpquerygtfoundposts gt ltphp e Search Results Found For, locale  gt ltphp thesearchquery gt                 lth1gt             ltheadergtlt .pageheader gt                  ltphp                      Start the Loop.                     while  haveposts   thepost                                                     Include the post formatspecific template for the content.

My current folder is called ewgi2014 however, replacing codetwentyfourteenpagingnavcode with codeewgi2014pagingnavcode spat back the same error, and I cant find any more useful information on the topic.  Also, when looking at other sample search.php files I didnt see the codepagingnavcode call, so I tried commenting it out, and was able to at least avoid the error, though I still dont understand it.p  pSample output on the page after searching for the term, say, program isp  blockquote   p8 Search Results Found For programp blockquote  p...with nothing else written beyond that.p  pNot entirely relevant, I believe, but my searchform.php looks like thisp  precodeltform rolesearch methodget classsearchform actionltphp echo homeurl   gtgt     ltlabelgt         ltinput typesearch classsearchfield placeholdersearch  value names titleSearch for gt     ltlabelgt     ltinput typesubmit classsearchsubmit valueSearch gt ltformgt codepre  pIve read and reread the Creating a Search Page page from the Codex so many times I could probably recite it by heart, but havent found any solutions within.p  pIve read the stackoverflow hit about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14802498howtodisplaywordpresssearchresultsHow to display Wordpress search resultsa and have tried the code from ThemeShaper, but that throws an error on the codeshapecontentnavcode lines.p  pIve read a hrefhttplorelle.wordpress.com20060211understandingandfixingwordpresssearch relnofollowthisa and ... and apparently I cant link to all the other things Ive read as this is my first post, but I have been reading a lot, and fiddling, and making very little headway.p  pApologies for the longwinded post.

Negative 261 pIm trying to read from codestderrcode of a child process. The data is lines of text created with codesprintfstderr, some debug infoncode. Im using codeReadFileEcodex with a completion routine. I dont know how many lines of text or how long each line will be. So, what do I put as the codenNumberOfBytesToReadcode parameterp  pMy guess is I put the max size of my buffer, which I will make 4k although I dont know if thats an optimal size. Im guessing that if the line written to codestderrcode is shorter than 4k, the completion routine wont fire. Im guessing that when the 4k is reached but more data remains, I have to fire off another codeReadFileExcode within the completion routine. Ill know this is the case because codeGetLastErrorcode will return codeERRORMOREDATAcode. Im hoping that I get a call when the buffer isnt full, but the child process has exited. Im not sure I get a completion callback when the child process exits, because I passed the codestderrcode write handle to the child when I created it maybe I get the callback when emIem close that handle.

What I want to do is erase any entry title and paragraphs who has less than 5 paragraphs and then save it to a new JSON file. I wrote the following code and every time I execute it I get 4 OKs else branch is executing and then it stops. I tried to print lendocs[x] and I get the number of paragraphs each title has and I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong and it executed only 4 times. I suspect that something is wrong with my if statement but I cannot get it.

I was testing the cluster with word count program to make sure it works fine.p  pAt the beginning, I got a permission denied error as it cant run mapper.py, some one suggested to move mapper.py and reducer.py to tmp where everyone has execute permission. Looks like I dont get the permission denied Error anymore, but this error as shown shows up all the time.p  pAny clue or suggestions what I should do to go through this, I followed the logs nothing

Negative 261 piOS Facebook required me to add a URL scheme so that users can loginsign up via Facebook in my app.  So, can I also use this Facebook URL scheme for launching my app  I dont need to support deep linkingId just like to launch the app from a marketing email. Clearly adding my own URL Scheme is preferred, but adding my own scheme will take a couple weeks before the app is in production.p  pAny reason why I shouldnt just use the Facebook URL scheme in the meantime like fb12345testp

Negative 261 pHow can I use braceexpansion to make the equivalent of emcal 8 2014 cal 9 2014em emcal 8,9 2014em expands to emcal 8 9 2014em showing the 9th of September. emcal 08 2014,09 2014em isnt a valid brace expansion, and I cant use emcal 08 2014,09 2014em because that expands to emcal 08 2014 09 2014em which is two parameters that obviously dont make sense together here  Im starting to question the utility of brace expansion....p

Negative 261 pI have just started programming in Java again and I am having some trouble. What I want to do is create an object that will be an array of arbitrary dimension. That is it will be an array of arrays of arrays... and so on. What I was thinking of doing was making a class that is an array of arbitrary objects. Thus I could just create the multidimensional array of dimension d by making an array of multidimensional arrays with dimension d1. The code, I think, would look something like thisp  precodeArray[] multiArray  public MArrayint d     ifdlt0MArrayd  null     elsemultiArray  MArrayd1  codepre  pHowever I dont know if Array[] is the correct thing to do to create an array of arbitrary objects. I seem to recall when I was learning Java a few years ago there was a way you could it but I cant remember and my Google searches are proving fruitless. p

Negative 261 pIm working on a project for class using Java and UDP senders and receivers. The premise of the problem is to read in a text file, store the contents within a packet, send the packet, receive the packet, and read out the file on screen and create a new text document on the receiving computer of an identical text file.p  pI have all of that working. When I test with a local host it appears to work 100 of the time. When I send it from my laptop to my PC it appears to work 100 of the time. However, when I send it from my PC to my laptop it does not work. p  pI have several System.out debug statements to verify some of the information I send. I know that the text file should take 7 packets. However, whenever I send it from my PC to my laptop it says that I am sending 46 packets.p  pMy initial thought is that maybe the packets are being sent out of order. The first packet I am sending indicates how many packets the receiver should be expecting to receive. I thought maybe for some reason the 46 could indicate a capital F so I removed all the capital F and it still says Im sending 46 packets. p  pI thought maybe I was sending too much information at once so I used Thread.sleep to give my receiver time to keep up  that did not work either.p  pFinally, I read through the Oracle Documentation and some posts online and found out that UDP is unreliable. So, Im assuming it could potentially be that. However, I want to just verify that that could be the issue.p  pOr if anyone has a better idea as to what could be causing the problem that would be awesome as wellp  pThanks for your help p

Negative 261 pIm observing something that is not consistent with what I know about the codegit checkoutcode command. While on a branch other than codemastercode, I make some modifications to a tracked file without staging and committing those changes, I runp  precodegit checkout master codepre  pGit complies without batting an eyelid but what is even more surprising is that all the modifications I made on that branch are still present Here is an example reproducing the situationp  precodemkdir myrepo cd myrepo git init touch README  create a new file git add . git commit m initial commit git checkout b newbranch echo foo gtgt README git checkout master   codepre  pAt this stage, the codeREADMEcode file in my working tree contains the codefoocode line, even though I added it while on the other branch codenewbranchcode.

Negative 261 pRecently I came to SO in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26047184howtochangethesizeofaqcomboboxsqscrollbarthis questiona asking how could I get my hands on a QComboBox QScrollBar in order to change its thickness. After reading the replies, I tried Marco A. solution for my Qt Embedded application and it didnt worked. Then, for test, I changed the compilation environment to Desktop and the fix worked p  pSo essentially my problem is that when I try to change a QComboBoxs QScrollBar width in Qt for Embedded Linux ARM, nothing happens, but if I compile the exact same code for Qt for Desktop, it works. The following is the code Im using for testsp  precodeQAbstractItemView poView  uigtcomboBoxgtview QScrollBar poBar  poViewgtverticalScrollBar poBargtsetStyleSheetwidth 50px codepre  pand there is another code that does the same, but shows the same problemp  precodeuigtcomboBoxgtsetStyleSheetQScrollBarvertical  width 50px  codepre  pWith codecomboBoxcode being declared in the ui form in Qt Designer inside Qt Creator. p  pQt versions are the same for Desktop and Qt for Embedded Linux 4.8.5. Another thing I found strange but should have nothing to do with it is that compiling the same code again for Desktop shows a QComboBox with a Windows XP style, while for Embedded the Plastique style is used I notice that quite clearly due to Plastique showing three instead of two buttons to scroll the scroll bar.p  pSo what could be happening How may I solve this problemp

The goal is for me to trigger sensor2, have SerialTest.java acknowledge the input of it being triggered and then move the red square from MoveLabel.java to the JLabel named sensor2. I have bolded the area in which I need to call the method, Im just not really remembering how to, granted I was never good with that from the beginning.p  precodeimport java.io.BufferedReader import java.io.InputStreamReader import java.io.OutputStream import gnu.io.CommPortIdentifier  import gnu.io.SerialPort import gnu.io.SerialPortEvent  import gnu.io.SerialPortEventListener  import java.util.Enumeration   public class SerialTest extends MoveLabel implements SerialPortEventListener        SerialPort serialPort              The port were normally going to use.       private static final String COM4[]           devtty.usbserialA9007UX1,  Mac OS X                             devttyACM0,  Raspberry Pi        devttyUSB0,  Linux        COM6,  Windows                    A BufferedReader which will be fed by a InputStreamReader        converting the bytes into characters        making the displayed results codepage independent            private BufferedReader input       The output stream to the port       private OutputStream output       Milliseconds to block while waiting for port open       private static final int TIMEOUT  2000       Default bits per second for COM port.       private static final int DATARATE  9600       public void initialize                       the next line is for Raspberry Pi and                       gets us into the while loop and was suggested here was suggested httpwww.raspberrypi.orgphpBB3viewtopic.phpf81ampt32186                     System.setPropertygnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts, devttyACM0        CommPortIdentifier portId  null       Enumeration  portEnum  CommPortIdentifier.getPortIdentifiers      System.out.printlnCommPortIdentifier.getPortIdentifiers        First, Find an instance of serial port as set in PORTNAMES.       while portEnum.hasMoreElements         CommPortIdentifier currPortId  CommPortIdentifier portEnum.nextElement        System.out.printlnPortid    currPortId        System.out.printlnPortname    currPortId.getName        for String portName  COM4          if currPortId.getName.equalsportName           portId  currPortId          break                               if portId  null         System.out.printlnCould not find COM port.        return              try          open serial port, and use class name for the appName.        serialPort  SerialPort portId.openthis.getClass.getName,          TIMEOUT          set port parameters        serialPort.setSerialPortParamsDATARATE,          SerialPort.DATABITS8,          SerialPort.STOPBITS1,          SerialPort.PARITYNONE          open the streams        input  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderserialPort.getInputStream        output  serialPort.getOutputStream          add event listeners        serialPort.addEventListenerthis        serialPort.notifyOnDataAvailabletrue        catch Exception e         System.err.printlne.toString                            This should be called when you stop using the port.

For the record, I understand that the injected method or function is not able to do inherently unsafe things in the sense of arbitrary memory access, but I would think that it could allow the calling code to call e.g. arbitrary .Net framework functions, corrupt data, or otherwise cause the application to misbehave.p  pIs this assumption wrongp  pIf it is not, what should be done to lock these down Additionally, is there any way to validate the code codecodeFuncltgtcode that is passed into a method or function to ensure that it is of an expected form or to restrict its access to certain types and namespacesp  pAlso, forgive me if Im not quite using the right terminology, Im still learning.p

Negative 261 pFor university, I need to tunnel my SVN traffic through SSH because the server is normally not reachable from the outside. I have to work with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and installed AnkhSVN as my VCS.p  pI now have the problem that I cannot create a tunnel  to the subversion repo. I have done it before with Eclipse with the following settings I opened putty, connected to myproxy.myuniversity22. I also created a tunnel with putty under connection  SSH  tunnels which forwards the traffic from my local port 5050 to the remote port 22. In Eclipse, I edited the settings for the SOCKS proxy and set it to 127.0.0.15050. The fields for httphttps proxy were left blank. That worked fine.p  pBut unfortunately, Visual Studio provides no way to edit the proxy settings. In AnkhSVN I can only edit the httphttps proxy settings but I cannot change the SOCKS settings which is needed. To change Windows SOCKS proxy does not help either.p  pIs there any way to tunnel my SVN traffic through SSH or is there any other Visual Studio plugin which supports this kind of proxy I highly want to avoid to use TortoiseSVN since it has screwed up my laptop ago.p

Negative 261 pMy company just started using git and Im struggling with versioning. We are using semantic versioning major.minor.patch, which we set based on changes made to the product. However, Id like to use the fourth part to indicate the git commit.  Ive read articles on how to do this, especially one using the postmerge hook, but the more I got into it, the more confused I became, not on the technical part, but on the conceptual part. p  pI really like the idea of being able to use the git commit hash in the version, as it makes it very clear what the software is. However, I cant know this until emafterem the commit, at which point, changing the version would require another commit and the hash would be incorrect. So, if I get a version number, go to git, Id actually be getting the commit before the one in use. What Id want is to be able to go to git, grab the tag and have it built emexactlyem as it is in use.p  pI suspect that the answer lies in the build process, in that that process would query git, get the hash, update the codeAssemblyInfo.cscode and then build the product. p  pAs Im very new to all this, Im wondering ifp  ul liAm I missing something conceptuallyli liThere is better way than the buildli liIf using the build process is the way to go, are there any proven ways of handling thisli ul  pThanksp

Whenever someone makes changes, that person adds an entry to the ChangeLog and uses that exact entry as the text of the commit message. A ChangeLog entry could look something like the followingp  precode20150427 L. Ron Hubbard ltlrhsern.chgt      add class Vector to tools.py      add example.root codepre  pMy question is this how should ChangeLogs be handled when dealing with branches Should the entries of a branch ChangeLog be tagged with the branch name Should a branch ChangeLog be updated at all Should all changes made using a branch be listed in one entry when the branch is merged with the trunk Should there even embeem a ChangeLogp

I have the search functionality working fine, it is inside func searchBarsearchBar UISearchBar, textDidChange searchText String so the results are dynamic, but I just cant figure out how to dynamically populate the results in the table view.p  pIn func searchBarsearchBar UISearchBar, textDidChange searchText String, I have tried but it doesnt workp  precode    self.containerView.hidden  false     let searchResultsVC  childViewControllers.first as SearchResultsViewController     searchResultsVC.results  results codepre

Negative 261 pI am familiar with codestdsharedptrcode and codestdweakptrcode and know how they work. However, I would like the codestdsharedptrcode to emit a callback, like a boost signal. This would allow codestdweakptrcode, who still refer to the deleted object, to be cleaned up right in time.p  pIs there maybe already some smart pointer implementation, which will report the destructionp  h2Explanationh2  pI think there might be a small design flaw in codestdweakptrcodes, that can lead to false memory leaks. By false memory leak I mean an object, that is still accessible by the program, but whose reason of existence is not valid anymore. The difference to a true memory leak is, that the true memory leak is completely unknown by the program, while the false leak is just a part that wasnt cleaned up properly.p  pAnother description can be found at a hrefhttpwww.codingwisdom.comcodingwisdom201209referencecountedsmartpointersareforretards.html relnofollowcodingwisdom.comap  blockquote   pUse Watchersp      ol   lipOne of the problems with freeing an object is that you may have done so while other things are still pointing at it.  This introduces dangling pointers and crashes  To combat the evil of dangling pointers, I like to use a basic watcher system.  This is not unlike the weak reference discussed above.  The implementation is like thispli   lipCreate a base class Watchable that you derive from on objects that should broadcast when theyre being deleted.  The Watchable object keeps track of other objects pointing at it.   Create a Watcher smart pointer that, when assigned to, adds itself to the list of objects to be informed when its target goes away.pli   ol      pThis basic technique will go a long way toward solving dangling pointer issues without sacrificing explicit control over when an object is to be destroyed.p blockquote  h2Exampleh2  pLets say we implement the observer pattern using boost a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1580dochtmlsignals2.html relnofollowBoost Signals2a. We have a class codeObservablecode, that contains one or more signals and another class codeObservercode, that connects to codeObservablecodes  signals.p  pWhat would happen to codeObservablecodes slots, when a observing codeObservercode is deleted When we do nothing, then the connection would point to nowhere and we would probably receive a segmentation fault, when emitting the signal.p  pTo deal with this issue, boosts slots also offer a method codetrackconst weakptrltvoidgtamp trackedobjectcode. That means, if I call codetrackcode and pass a codeweakptrcode to codeObservercode, then the slot wont be called when the codeweakptrcode expired. Instead, it will be deleted from the signal.p  pWhere is the problem Lets we delete an codeObservercode and never call a certain signal of codeObservablecode ever again. In this case, the tracked connection will also never be deleted. Next time we emit the signal it will be cleaned up. But we dont emit it. So the connection just stays there and wastes resources.p  pA solution would be when owning codesharedptrcode should emit a signal when it is destroying its object. This would allow other other objects to clean up right in time. Everything that has a codeweakptrcode to the deleted object might register a callback and false memory leaks could be avoided.p

Negative 261 pI have implemented the code necessary to take advantage of reusable header views as described in the accepted answer here   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17651880uitableviewheaderfooterviewininterfacebuilderUITableViewHeaderFooterView in InterfaceBuilderap  pTo summarize, I have a NIB whos class derives from UITableViewHeaderFooterView, I register the NIB in viewDidLoad forHeaderFooterViewReuseIdentifier and I dequeueReusableHeaderFooterViewWithIdentifier in the viewForHeaderInSection method.  This all works, compiles, and runs.p  pThe code closely parallels the typical usereuse of UITableViewCells also being used in this screen.  If I set a breakpoint on the dealloc methods for both the table cells, and table header cells I see the table cells get created, reused, and rarely dealloced.p  pThe call to dequeueReusableHeaderFooterViewWithIdentifier returns a nonnil value and the result gets returned as the viewForHeaderInSection.  However, the header cell dealloc method gets called for each header cell every time reloadData is called on the table.  The table cells dont, so in other words the header cells arent really being reused, if the cell behavior is the standard for defining reuse.  Or, at least it can be said that the header cells arent reused as much as the cells are.p  pApple provides an example of header reuse in the Table View Animations and Gestures code example.  If I add a dealloc method to their custom header class, it DOES get called when table reloadData is called.  I added a timer to their class that calls reloadData every 10 secondsp  pDoes anyone know if this is the expected behavior and Im misunderstanding reuse, or has Apple not really implemented the reuse behavior for header cells that is seen in table cellsp  pThanks   p

The reason is that my real code is more complex and involves passing the codefcode codestdbindcode return object across a thread boundary, and both the codeacode and codebcode codestdbindcode return objects may go out of scope in the original thread before codecallhandlercode calls codefcode, so codeacode and codebcode need to copy or move into codefcode, not be mere references. That said, my question is specifically about codestdbindcode and perfect forwarding, and for the purpose of asking a good question, Ive distilled out everything not needed to reproduce the specific compiler errors I mentioned.p
Negative 261 pConsider the following silly, simple examplep  precodelet arr  [hey, ho] let doubled  arr.map 0  0 let capitalized  arr.map 0.capitalizedString codepre  pAs you can see, Im processing the same initial array in multiple ways in order to end up with multiple processed arrays.p  pNow imagine that codearrcode is very long and that I have many such processes generating many final arrays. I dont like the above code because we are looping multiple times, once for each codemapcode call.

So my question is is there a better, Swiftier way In a hazy way I imagine myself using codemapcode, or something like codemapcode, to generate something like a tuple and magically splitting that tuple out into all resulting arrays as we iterate, as if I could say something like this pseudocode, dont try this at homep  precodelet arr  [hey, ho] let doubled, capitalized  arr.map      codepre  pIf I were designing my own language, I might even permit a kind of splatting by assignment into a pseudoarray of lvaluesp  precodelet arr  [hey, ho] let [doubled, capitalized]  arr.map      codepre  pNo big deal if it cant be done, but it would be fun to be able to talk this way.p

Negative 261 pCurrently I am developing a plugin interface for my C application and am struggling with how to pass my data in an efficient way. I have read a lot of posts, tutorials and so on, and now decided to just use a proxy Cstyle API. p  pIf I got it right I have to convert my classes or more specifically the data members to POD types somehow, but I want to circumvent unnecessary copy operations the passed data can be quite large under special circumstances. p  pI Am I right that the layout of data members inside C classes is up to the compiler and I thus cannot just pass a pointer to the first data member to the pluginp  pII I could move the data members to structs, which in turn would be the only data members of POD type of my classes then.

Negative 261 pI have several Google Sheets that I connect and update cells between them.  Right now I have to use R1C1 or A1 type references to define getting or setting cells based on specific columns.p  pIf a new column is added, all those references are now off.p  pRow one of each sheet has column headers as values in those cells.p  pCan I reference a cell in a format such as [columnHeader]5 for the cell in that column, fifth rowp  pI thought of setting each individual column heading as a named range, but I am stuck at being able to reference a cell using [named range]5.p  pI suppose I could use some method of dynamically defining 100 variables to the then current column numbers R1C1 format in all the sheets and then try to use those pseudoheader variables in my cell references. But I will probably run the scripts 100s of times a day and that horrible inefficiency hurts the engineer in me.p  pThanks in advance.p  pchuckp

Negative 261 pWe are aworking on a project with GIT, but the guy who launch the project and create the git repository doesnt explain to the team how to correctly and properly use GIT. I just arrived into the team last week and I have been charged to clean up the repositories which are all messy.p  pFirst of all, there are 13 subprojects so 13 repositories to one only final project. And the 13 repositories has been badly used. For example, for all this repositories, There are strongmasterstrong branches which are unused since the last march month... and there are second branch strongdevelopstrong which is strongdirectlystrong used by each developer.p  pLast week I tried to explain how to have a better use of git branching and commands to the new team, I think that It will be applied. But at the moment I would like to enjoy again a good branching model in our repository.p  pAt this time, first, I would like to emrebase the remote branch develop on the remote master branchem to get an up to date master branch in the end, she will be a production branch.p  pThen I would keep the develop branch which will be renamed empreproductionem and which will be used with a tag system for each delivery on the preproduction serverp  pAnd to conclude I would have a third branch the new develop which will be well used with pull request etc. by developers.p  pemSo can I safely rebase the remote develop branch on the remote master branch  Or there will be risks and conflicts for others developers emp  pemIf its not possible, which is the best way to correspond to the branching that I want to set up emp  pThank you very much for your help.p  pJeanTimothep

Negative 261 pHi guys Im playing around trying to draw with my Mainthreat onto a canvas. Basicly my aim is to get a rectangle, and when I touch it it changes the color. In the onCreate Method I create the rectangle and call the strongquadr1.setColorstrong Method to give it a fill. Then i start the threat. Now the draw Method should just recall the strongquadr1.drawstrong method, and redraw the rectangle with the same color. When I touch quadr1 the threat calls now strongquadr1.setColorstrong again, instead of strongquadr1.drawstrong.

I expected the SelectList to contain the same 4 items that was passed to the view plus the Selected property set to true for the one that was actually selected. Now I know my assumptions were wrong. So, my question is, how do I pass a Model to my view that contains a list of items, display that list in a kendo dropdownlist, and know which item was selected once the post action is executedp

Negative 261 pRecently, while developing an app for iOS, XCode has begun to exhibit buggy behavior that hasnt gone away even after reinstalling my entire Mac which leads me to believe that something in the project settings may be causing this.  In the left panel, switching to a pane other than the Project Navigator then switching back to it causes Project Navigator to expand ALL of the folders in my project.  In addition, if I attempt to make a new group by right clicking and selecting New Group, a new folder shows up momentarily, then disappears again.  The .pbxproj file is modified as well, but the new folder doesnt show up even if I restart XCode.  Has anyone been able to fix this before  I wasnt able to find any posts anywhere relevant to this its kind of a hard problem to Google....  Thanksp

Negative 261 pI have a fun problem that Im trying to solve. Ive been given a data set from a sensor in Cartesian coordinates. This data is very dense so there is no shortage of points.p  pNow assuming that the origin of this data is at 0,0 I want to find the potential offset of the sensor in that frame. p  pMy attempt was to create the convex hull of this data set, and then check for groups of intersecting lines whichs intersection lies within a certain distance from the origin point. This give a good approximation using this ideal data, a hrefhttpi60.tinypic.com8y6epu.jpg relnofollowClick Mea.p  pIn Link 1 you see a few green lines, these are the Mainline Ive taken from the convex hull that are good candidates to use. There are a lot of them since the image is done from a loop.p  pNow, to my problem. The data I get is noisy so there are many outlying points, that is, points that are really outside the FOV but still get measured. These bad points are few, but enough so that the convex hull approach does not work Ive tried alpha shapes as well, it does work better but still not good enough.p  pI was wondering if you have any ideas to what direction I could go to solve this dilemma Preferably Id like to extract this origin point as binomial distribution.p  pHere is an example image of raw data although Ive changed it and removed data for IP reasons. a hrefhttpi60.tinypic.com8y6epu.jpg relnofollowClick Mea.p  pAn idea I had was maybe work with the data in polar coordinates, and then use dohougs transform to extract clear straight lines in polar coordinates, which could give me a set of arc lengths at a certain distance R and then somehow go from therep  pP.S. Sorry for few links, only allowed to put two here and now images p

Negative 261 pI am working on a parser for a language that hasp  ul lipidentifiers say, a letter followed by a number of alphanumeric characters or an underscore,pli lipintegers any number of digits and possibly carets codecode,pli lipsome operators,pli lipfilename a number of alphanumeric characters and possibly slashes, and dotspli ul  pApparently filename overlaps integers and identifiers, so in general I cannot decide if I have a filename or, say, an identifier unless the filename contains a slash or a dot.p  pBut filename can only follow a specific operator.p  pMy question is how this situation is usually handled during tokenization I have a table driven tokenizer lexer, but I am not sure how to tell a filename from either an integer or an identifier. How is this donep  pIf filename was a superset of integers and identifiers then I probably could have grammar productions that could handle that, but the tokens overlap...p
Negative 261 pIm making this example GUI that simply moves computer parts from one side to another, with the ability to load and save list in xml to the desktop. Everything works fine except for the reloading of saved xml files. I think it has something to do with the annotations in the Save.java. That being said Im not sure what is needed or if that is the issue. Any help will be appreciated. p  pstrongWindow.javastrongp  precodeimport java.awt.EventQueue  import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JPanel  import java.awt.BorderLayout  import

And if I view the records of a particular customer within a date range, then OPENING BALANCE row should show the previous balance until the start date of the given date criteria. Ex If I select records from 08252015 to 08262015 as per above datas, the report will show the two particular records 2nd amp 3rd. But I want to show the previous balance 10,000 or the total amount which is above to the star date 08252015 should be shown in the OPENING BALANCE row. And the sub total amount of this vendors  should be shown in the last NET TOTAL row. So, pls help me, how the formulas will come amp how to do.p  pThank youp  pI expect your great help Thank youp
