Positive 6409 pI am currently trying to extend my own little framework for WordPressthemes by a notification module. This is not supposed to replace exceptions  even though the concept might be similar. Since I am trying to write the framework objectoriented and am still new to this whole concept, I ran into a problem which I cant figure out how to solve.p  pstrongThe following codestrong declares an abstract notification class with a constructor requesting notificationtitle and message. Afterwards, the constructor adds the member method codeshowcode to the wordpress action stack. Since the user and the rest of the frameworkcode should not pass the type of the notification as a parameter, I created four classes for every notification type, extending the notification class. Those child classes dont need to overwrite the whole method of showing the notification, they only need to change the codetypecode property of the class they are extending. The base functionality works, so the notifications are shown on my page.p  pstrongThe problem isstrong The codetypecode property is empty, when codeshowcode is called on the pagefooter by WordPress codedoaction easenotifications code. I found out, that propertys are not set before the constructor is called which really makes sense somehow.... Anyway, the method using the codetypecode property is codeshowcode, and this method is called long after the class has been constructed. So theoretically, the property should have been set by then. Can you explain to me why it isntp  precodeabstract class EaseNotification      private type     private title     private message      public function construct title, message               thisgttitle  title         thisgtmessage  message         addaction easenotifications, arrayampthis, show            public function show              echo ltdiv classeasenotification type . thisgttype . gt            . ltspan classeasenotificationtitlegt . thisgttitle . ltspangt            . ltp classeasenotificationbodygt . thisgtmessage . ltpgt            . ltdivgt        class EaseError extends EaseNotification  private type  error  class EaseWarning extends EaseNotification  private type  warning  class EaseInformation extends EaseNotification  private type  information  class EaseConfirmation extends EaseNotification  private type  confirmation  codepre  pUsage of the notification classp  precoderequireonce class.easenotification.php   new EaseConfirmation Hurray, It works, so you can be very happy.  codepre

Positive 6409 pWe have a WordPress Multisite with a inhouse Bootstrap theme. Its basically a WebPortal for condominiums that allows facility booking with a business directory and a bbPress forum. We are facing the following challengesp  ol liWe have a small dev team, only myself and another parttime fullstack dev, and a QAfrontend developer. Im the third lead developer for this product and the first two didnt really do a good job in planning out the products architecture.li liWe were given the project in a notsomaintainable way. The markup is incorrect no code.containercodes and code.rowcodes for the code.colcodes, isnt valid HTML, and the CSS doesnt follow best practices overlynested, high codeimportantcode usage, usage of codeidscode, etc..li liThere is a reliance on a thirdparty plugin for the facilities booking module, but it produces its own markup and CSS that we have to code around to get it to look and feel like the sites base theme.li liOur codefunctions.phpcode is one huge monolithic file with 2.4k lines. When I came aboard, I tried using includes to mitigate it getting more bloated. I dont even know where to start refactoring this.li liOur base CSS span over 30,000 lines uncompressed and, as mentioned earlier has excessive nesting. We are already using SASS, but even then, most is wrong. Im not sure if this is normal for a Bootstrap theme. Similarly, I do not know how to start cleaning this up.li ol  pWhile it all works, its very far from maintainable. Were quickly discovering that implementing new features is a pain. PO finds issues every once in a while across different devices. Plugin updates also cause issues so our development time is even cut more.p  pIve told our PO that we need to refactor. And while he did agree mostly because of all the issues he finds, hes also asking if its the right time to incorporate all these new tech hes hearing like Angular or Laravel.p  pAre there any advise you can give me to get this product on the right track How long will refactoring this take Should we move away from WordPress If we do, how will we deal with the plugins were currently using Any related advise is appreciated.p  pHeres are production sites in the network in questionp  pa hrefhttpssky11.com.sg relnofollowhttpssky11.com.sgap  pa hrefhttpssignaturepark.com.sg relnofollowhttpssignaturepark.com.sgap

Typically this is done by concatenating the salt with the password before passing it through the hashing algorithm. But the examples vary... Some examples prepend the salt before the password. Some examples add the salt emafterem the password.

Negative 6409 pSo I am a little confused, I have been looking around trying to determine an appropriate way of inheriting from stdexception for my own type. Now according to cplusplus.com and i know this isnt necessarily the standard, thats why Im asking, stdexception is a base class with no members. However, after looking at my implementation of the standard library VS 2005, the class stdexception is quite clearly defined with two member variablesp  precodeclass CRTIMPPURE exception      base of all library exceptions         ...  private     const char mwhat     int mdoFree      codepre  pNow is this standard to have these members included within the base class stdexception, my understanding was that it isnt. My reason for asking is that my derived exception class really only needs a single string for its information, thus this implementation would work fine. However, Im worried that this is nonstandard, and as such I might be better off inheriting from stdexception and adding the appropriate members  copyassignment code myself.p

Negative 6409 pAnybody knows a faster way to do what codejava.nio.charset.Charset.decode..codecodeencode..code doesp  pIts currently one of the bottleneck of a technology that Im using.p  p[EDIT] Specifically, in my application, I changed one segment from a javasolution to a JNIsolution because there was a C technology that was most suitable for my needs than the Java technology that I was using.p  pThis change brought about some significant decrease in speed and significant increase in cpu amp mem usage. p  pLooking deeper into the JNIsolution that I used, the java application is communicating with the C application via byte[]. These byte[] are produced by Charset.encode.. from the java side and passed to the C side. Then when the C response with a byte[], it gets decoded in the java side via Charset.decode...p  pRunning this against a profiler, I see that Charset.decode.. and Charset.encode.. both took a significantly long time compared to the whole execution time of the JNIsolution I profiled only the JNIsolution because its something I could whip up quite quickly. Ill profile the whole application on a latter date once I free up my schedule  . p  pUpon reading further regarding my problem, its seems that its a known problem with Charset.encode.. and decode.. and its being addressed in Java7. However, moving to Java7 is not an option for me for now due to some constraints. p  pWhich is why I ask here if somebody knows a Java5 solution  alternative to this Sorry, should have mentioned that this was for Java5 sooner  p

Negative 6409 pI have a need to run an application in classic mode for backwards compatibility with a specific application, and am trying to understand what kind of impact that will have on the performance of an MVC application that is running on the site.p  pIf we put a few static file maps for .js, .css, .png, etc above the ASP.NET wildcard map to reduce the amount of processing by the ASP.NET handler, will we be approaching the integrated mode in terms of performance  p  pThe thing im primarily concerned with is any effect this might have on output caching.  I understand that integrated mode might  allow for the output cache to handle non ASP.NET content, but that isnt really a concern.  Were more interested in ensuring that the MVC application has full use of the output cache.p  pEmpirically ive found that the two configurations operate on par when things go well, but if the page references resources that are not available, the integrated mode tends to fail much more quickly than the classic mode e.g. 500 ms vs 10 seconds, reducing hang time on the page load.p  pThanks for any feedback.p

Negative 6409 pThis is very odd.p  pWe have some managed C an assembly which uses a .NET COM interop dll generated by TlbImp to make calls into a COM object. When we register the COM DLL we specify that we want it to execute within a surrogate the DLLSurrogate registry entry.p  pOur COM DLL is 64bit and is executing on a 64bit platform.p  pWhen we integrate the assembly with a 32bit application which contains managed and unmanaged code calls into the COM library execute within DllHost. A 64bit build of the same application causes the calls to be executed within the calling process.p  pPure unmanaged client applications both 32 and 64 bit execute properly on the 64bit system which shows I hope that we have configured  installed the COM library properly.p  pThis behaviour could indicate that the .NET COM Interop is ignoring the configuration information in the registry. The 32bit client cannot load the 64bit COM DLL into its address space and defaults to using a surrogate Anyway, this behaviour is disastrous for us as the COM library contains a singleton representing access to some hardware and there maybe many client processes. p  pHas any one noted this behaviour beforep  pThanks,p  pMike Dp

The code refers to some variables off the stack a word at 0004A7, an array of long words of starting at 000CA7 whose length is the value at 0004A7, and a final long word beyond that array that seems to be a pointer to a character string. p  pThe array of long words looks like strings at first glance, so it looks superficially like were dealing with an int argc, char  argv situation, except the argv array is inline in the stack frame.p  pWhat should a program be expecting on its stack  registers when it first gets called by the Mac OSp
Negative 6409 pI just started C but have some prior knowledge to other languages vb awhile back unfortunately, but have an odd predicament. I disliked using so many IF statements and wanted to use switchcases as it seemed cleaner, and I wanted to get in the practice.. But..p  pLets say I have the following scenario theorietical codep  precodewhile1     Loop can be conditional or 1, I use it alot, for example in my game   char something   stdcout ltlt Enter somethingn gt   stdcin  gtgt something    Switch to read something   switchsomething      case a       cout ltlt You entered A, which is correct       break     case b       cout ltlt ...       break     codepre  pAnd thats my problem. Lets say I wanted to exit the WHILE loop, Itd require two break statementsp  pThis obviously looks wrongp  precodecase a   cout ltlt You entered A, which is correct   break   break codepre  pSo can I only do an IF statement on the a to use break Am I missing something really simplep  pThis would solve a lot of my problems that I have right now.p

Negative 6409 pWith the Debugging Tools for Windows you can run SSIndex.cmd against your symbol files and it will embed the command to retrieve each source code file from the TF server.  We have a bunch of indexed files and recently our IT migrated our TFS 2008 installation to TFS 2010 and in the process changed the server name.  Question is, how can I update all these symbol files to point to the new server  I thought SSindex used an alternate data stream named srcsrv but SysInternals streams.exe shows nothing on these symbol files even though srctool.exe shows the data.p

Negative 6409 pmy questions are about login, and changing already saved data.p  hr  pQuestion 1p  pUntil now Ive only saved input in the tables of the database registration steps, now I need to check if the input login steps, match what is in database.  In fact I have 3 types of users, then Ill have to check 3 kind of tables. Then if the input data matches with one of those 3 tables I will redirect the user to their specific area.p  pIm thinking about saving the submitted data codeloginREQUEST[login]code and codepasswordREQUEST[password]code and compare with the login column in the database. Then if the login matches, Ill compare the password submitted with the one in the row, not in the column. But I dont know how to do this search and comparison, neither what to use. Then if both matches Ill redirect the user. Else Ill send a login error message I know how to do this already.p  hr  pQuestion 2p  pWhat if I need to change an already saved user, for example if they change their email address My changing users data web page is exactly the same like the registration user web page. Can I load the already saved options and values of registration Then the user will change whatever is necessary, and then when they submit the new information, they would not create a new row in my table, but just overwrite the old information How can I do thisp

Negative 6409 pI would like to implement a virtual filesystem using FUSE under Linux and Mac OS X. I have mainly worked in Java and .NETC, but also familiar with Python and do write small utilitiesshell scripts in Python.

I have a development team around me which also have worked most in Java and C. On top of that, the environment must have implementations of common cryptographic algorithm such as RijndaelAES and RSA.p  pIve considered Mono since we have a lot of client code in C already, but the binding havent been updated for a while and Im a bit concerned about deploying Mono on Mac OS X. Python is an option, but the team isnt too used to Python syntax although I know it. Java is an option, but I concerned about the bindings which seems to be a hrefhttpgithub.comdtrottfuse4j relnofollowforkeda without to much progress.p  pA last option which I have considered is a hrefhttplive.gnome.orgVala relnofollowValaa which has a hrefhttplive.gnome.orgValaBindingsStatus relnofollowFUSE bindinga, but the documentation and examples are missing.

I thought the easiest way was to have a singleton class that keeps Filestreams open for the appropriate log files so I could just do something likep  precodeUtil.Logger.GetInstance.LogAccessstr codepre  pOr something like that.p  pMy class looks like thisp  precodepublic sealed class Logger     private static StreamWriter sw    private static readonly Logger instance  new Logger    private Logger        sw  new StreamWriterlogfile        public static Logger GetInstance        return instance        public void LogAccessstring str        sw.WriteLinestr      codepre  pThis is all just in my head really, and Im looking for suggestions on how to make it better and also make sure Im doing it properly. The biggest thing is I need it to be thread safe, which obviously it is not in its current state. Not sure of the best way to do that.p

Negative 6409 pIve put an codeMKMapViewcode in a view at certain xy coordinates x25 y120 at a size thats about a third of the view tall and fills much of the width w275, h150. There are other elements in the view, mostly labels and buttons.p  pWhen looking at it after having it appear [edited to add while running the app in the simulator] pushed onto a codeUINavigationControllercode stack, a detail view of a table cell everything on the page is in its appropriate place EXCEPT for the codeMKMapViewcode, which is always its height further up on the page. That is, in the case of the measurements shown above it actually puts it at x25 y30. If I move it further down the page, say y300, it still moves it up the height of the map, in this case to y150.p  pWhy does it keep moving Its a terrible hack to initially position it 150 pixels farther down the view in order to have it end up at the right place.p

Negative 6409 pI want to send a large amount of data to a server using codeNSURLConnectioncode and codeNSURLRequestcode. For this I create a bound pair of codeNSStreamcodes using codeCFStreamCreateBoundPair...code. Then I pass the input stream to the codeNSURLRequestcode codesetHTTPBodyStreamcode and schedule the output stream on the current run loop. When the run loop continues, I get the events to send data and the input stream sends this data to the server.p  pMy problem is, that this only works when the data fits into the buffer between the paired streams. If the data is bigger, then somehow the input stream gets an event I assume bytes available but the NSURLConnection has not yet opened the input stream. This results in an error message printed and the data is not being sent.p  pI tried to catch this in my codestreamhandleEventcode method by simply returning if the input stream is not yet opened, but then my output stream gets a stream closed event probably because I never sent data when I could.p  pSo my question is How to use a bound pair of streams with NSURLConnection correctlyp  pIf this matters Im developing on the iOS platformp  pAny help is appreciatedp  pCheers, Markusp

Negative 6409 pThe question as to how to display an image, stored as an image in the database and as a byte array in code, has been answered several times e.g., a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions880515displayimagefromdatabaseinaspmvchttpstackoverflow.comquestions880515displayimagefromdatabaseinaspmvca, but what if you want to display the image in the context of a form.

I have got it working where the user can upload the image and it gets stored as part of the save process, along with the rest of the object fields.  But how do I send it back out and ideally display it with the rest of the data to populate the Edit form  All of the solutions Ive seen have some sort of ShowImage action that takes an Id and retrieves the image and streams it to the response.

Negative 6409 pI am working on a software project and have written a validation system to help prevent theft of the software. I was reading back through the code, and found a huge loophole that could potentially allow the motiviated users to copy the program and install it without even contacting the activation server. So, I modified the program and the server to patch that up. Now, I need a PHP page that can check to make sure the user paid for the software, payments made using PayPal, then generate a random string. I then need the page to POST that random string to the validation server  HTTP  and listen for the response from the server. It will need to POST this parameter Validator  [Random String] It will tell the page if the random string has already been submitted and to try another, or that it accepted the string. I would like the string to be numerical, but I think alpha  numeric would be better and give more options. I am pretty confident this can be done, but am not sure how to do the PHP part.p

Negative 6409 pIm trying to use application settings with a C.NET project I am working on. But I cant seem to get it to return anything other then the default values. Through the project properties Ive added a single setting, DBConnectionString, and set its value to a connection string I want to use. Its scope is set to application.p  pDoing this created a number of files including Settings.settings, Settings.Designer.CS, and app.conifg. From what I understand the two Settings. files define a custom codeSettingscode class that derives from codeApplicationSettingsBasecode. The codeSettingscode class then has custom, type safe, properties that can be used to set and retrieve each setting. The app.config file is a XML file that stores the actual settings values.p  pWhen I build my project it looks like the app.config file is copied to the target directory as MyApplication.dll.config. My program runs fine and is able to use the default connection string.p  pNext I tried to edit the MyApplicaiton.dll.config file to change the connection string. I ran my program again, but it continued to use the default value. I noticed that in my Settings.Designer file there is a codeDefaultSettingValueAttributecode with the original default string. I tried removing this attribute, but then when I tried to retrieve the connection string setting it just returned null.p  pThis is the code Im using to read the connection string.p  precodestring conn  Properties.Settings.Default.DbConnectionString codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong How can I get it to return the value in the settings file and not the default valuep  hr  pUpdatep  pSorry I should have mentioned this.

Negative 6409 pI build a postprocessing pipeline which collects rendercalls and puts them into a texture. After all postprocessing effects are rendered, I put all the results together. And here is my problemp  pAt the beginning, I clear the buffer with glClearColor0,0,0,0. Then I call the draw calls. The comes when an object has a texture with 0.5 alpha. This results a mix between the backgroundcolor and the texture. I would like to avoid the mix. For example, if the pixel of the texture is 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 the result is 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, because the black background with zero transparency is affected.p  pI use the glCopyTexImage2D function the put my render result into a texture. I read articles about using a framebuffer, but I would like to be sure if I can solve my problem with using of multiple framebuffers.p  pDoes anyone has an advice for mep
Negative 6409 pGreetings.  Does anyone know what this Fortran IF statement is doingp  precodeIFIJJ2 ,409,411 codepre  pI dont think its a typo because there are a few other in the same program.  I assumed it was a standard arithmetic IF that simply defaulted the less than 0 branch to the next exectutbale statement, but Im not sure about that.  I think this code was hosted on a CDC 6600 around 19701972.  I looked through the FORTRAN 77 subset standard but it specifies all three statement lables must be supplied. Any advice is most appreciated.p

Negative 6409 pI guess this is quite a strange question about models transformation.  I am starting from a UML 2.2 model defined with Rhapsody IBMTelelogic and exported in XMI by means of the Rhapsody XMI toolkit. I have succesfully opened it with Topcased The Eclipse based UMLSysml modeling environment. I have therefore applied a QVT transformation to it, aimed at creating a new UML model with a specific subset of entities.  Unfortunately i have not found the right way to retrieve entities description i.e. class and methods description i wrote in Rhapsody. I have noticed these are present in the XMI file as RhapsodyProfileRhpModelElement tags and  descriptionHTML or descriptionRTF attributes. However in the QVT transformation they are neither referrable as stereotypes nor as annotations. It is very important to me not to loose this information. Is there any of you who faced the same issuep  pThank you in advancep

Negative 6409 pHeres the setup  A Cisco 2800 series 2811 to be exact is connected to a dozen or so serial devices.  It acts as our terminal server.  The normal usage is to use this terminal server to telnet to the respective serial devices ie. telnet terminal.server.ip 2070 would open a shell to the device on line 70.  p  pWhat Im trying to do is slightly different  I have a PC connected to the Console port on the back of the terminal server.  Note that this is a serial connection, not a telnet session or the like.  I can connect to the terminal server just fine and get to the normal IOS shell.  What I am stuck on is then opening a console to any of the serial devices from within that IOS shell.  I would like to type something like connect line 70 or telnet serial 131.  p  pIt appears that all of connect or telnet or ssh commands take in a hostname or IP as a parameter, but not a serial port name.  I tried connectingtelnetting to localhost and 127.0.0.1 with no luck.  I tried the IPs of some loopback devices with no luck.  In the loopback case, it actually said connection refused, in other cases, it simply timed out. p  pAny tips  p  pPS.  as a followup, getting into the routerterminal server then using show hosts helps a lot.  if a host name shows up as, say hostX, then simply typing hostX will make a connection to that host.  i believe this telnets the local loopback address and uses the appropriate port to route it to the serial port.  perhaps this is as direct as we can get.  My fear is that I might be able to get to the console server, but not be able to set the loopback address pretend its missing or erroneous, and therefore not be able to telnet to the serial port.  Likewise, what if a serial port wasnt given a host name  how can I connect to that if I dont have the Config passwordp
Negative 6409 pI have a WCF service and 2 clients Im testing with. The first client is written in c .NET 3.5 and has no trouble connecting to the WCF service. The other client is written in Delphi7, and its the one Im interested in getting working. This is the interesting part. If I start the service then hit it with the Delphi client, it wont connect... but if I start the service then hit it with the .Net client then try the Delphi client, it works  Could be something to do with the designtime addresses, Im not sure. Maybe a more experienced person will know whats going on and what I need to do to get my Delphi client working without needing a .Net client running alongside it. It might be relevant to note that the service is currently being hosted in a winforms app.p

Negative 6409 pMy question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5827178usingrxframeworkforasynccallsusingthevoidasyncmethodactiontcallbackthisa question, but as always is slightly different.p  pI currently work on a project that uses a simple pattern to asynchronously receive notifications of underlying data changes.p  pClass Foo is responsible for subscribing to these data changes and provides a method for classes to register their interest in these changes by registering an instance of a class that implements a given interfacep  precodepublic Guid SubscribeToChangesISomeCallbackInterface callback codepre  pClass Bar implements this callback and registers itselfp  precodepublic class Bar  ISomeCallbackInterface      ...     initialise instance of Foo class and subscribe to updates     foo.SubscribeToChangesthis     ...      public void CallbackMethodstring id, IEnumerableltTupleltstring, int, objectgtgt data              ...       codepre  pIdeally we would like to throttle these callbacks, as we can for instance get a callback that changes the value of a particular piece of data from x to y and then back to x within the space of a second. Looking at the Rx documentation this would be trivial by using the DistinctUntilChanged operator.p  pHowever, the question is how to create an IObservable collection that I can then apply the operator to given my callback implementation above. The docs are very clear about how to create an IObservable from standard .Net events or Begin...End... method pairs.p  pUPDATE As Richard Szalay pointed out in his comment, I will need to use DistinctUntilChanged in tandem with Throttle to achieve what I need.p  pAgain, thanks to Richard, I also should have mentioned I need the ability to unsubscribe from the callbacks. In the current model I simply call UnscubscribeGuid subscriptionToken on the instance of Foo.p

Negative 6409 pAfter hours of searching google, with little luck, Im wondering if anybody knows how to either hide the cursor, or set a custom cursor which could be made blank in Windows when dragging and dropping.p  pIm writing a program which draws its own mouse using openGL, and normally the mouse hides just fine, but when I drag files onto the programs window, the windows cursor shows the draganddrop square and will not hide. ShowCursorFalse and SetCursorNone in python are inconsistent for hiding the cursor.p  pIdeally, if anybody knew how to do this in Python using pywin32, that would be ideal, as thats the language my project is using, but if I have to code this up in another language I will.p  pAlternately, if anybody knows when ShowCursor and SetCursor will guarantee to hide the cursor, whether this has to do with window focus or something related, that would also be helpful.p  pIve found this page a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.control.dodragdrop.aspxY1354 relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.control.dodragdrop.aspxY1354a I cannot get the C code to compile, and I get exceptions when I use the C and VB versions.

Negative 6409 pI dont know of a better way to word what Im looking for, so please bear with me.p  pLets say that I have a list of 17 elements. For the sake of brevity well represent this list as codeABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQcode. If I wanted to divide this into 7 sufficiently even sublists, it might look like thisp  pstrongcodeABCcode codeDEcode codeFGHcode codeIJcode codeKLcode codeMNOcode codePQcodestrongp  pHere, the lengths of each sublist are strong3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2strong. The maximum length is only one more than the minimum length codeABCcode codeDEcode codeFGHcode codeIcode codeJKLcode codeMNcode codeOPQcode has seven sublists as well, but the range of lengths is two here.p  pFurthermore, examine how many 2s separate each pair of 3s this follows the same rule of RANGE  1. The range of lengths in codeABCcode codeDEFcode codeGHcode codeIJcode codeKLMcode codeNOcode codePQcode is 1 as well, but they are imbalanced 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2. Ideally, if one were to keep reducing the sublist in such a fashion, the numbers would never deviate from one another by more than one.p  pOf course, there is more than one way to evenly divide a list into sublists in this fashion. Im not looking for an exhaustive set of solutions  if I can get one solution in Python for a list of any length and any number of sublists, thats good enough for me. The problem is that I dont even know where to begin when solving such a problem. Does anyone know what Im looking forp

Negative 6409 pAt a job interview I was asked the question In C how do you access a variable faster, though the normal variable identifier or though a pointer. I must say I did not have a good technical answer to the question so I took a wild guess.p  pemI said that access time will probably be that same as normal variableidentifier is a pointer to the memory address where the value is stored, just like a pointer. In other words, that in terms of speed they both have the same performance, and that pointers are only different because we can specify the memory address we want them to point to.emp  pThe interviewer did not seem very convincedsatisfied with my answer although he did not say anything, just carried on asking something else, therefore I though to come and ask SOers wether my answer was accurate, and if not why from a theory  and technical POV.p

Negative 6409 pWe have a lot of executables that reference one of our dlls. We found a bug in one of our dlls and dont want to have to recompile and redistribute all of our executables to fix it. My understanding is that dlls will keep their compatibility with their executables so long as you dont change anything in the header file. So no new class members, no new functions, etc... but a change to the logic within a function should be fine. Is this correct If it is compiler specific, please let me know, as this may be an issue.p

Negative 6409 pThis is a best practice type of question.  I am developing a complete AJAX application.  The user navigates to the main page of the application and everything from there on out is loaded via AJAX into the content section of the main page.  Is it better to take all the javascript files I have and merge them into one file that is loaded on the main page or to split them up into just what is needed for each page that is loadedp  pPutting it all in one file obviously has the benefit that only one HTTP request is made to load the javascript needed for the site and any request for a page there after will only need to fetch the HTML.  But, this requires that every event that is wired up using jQuery be attached to the document using the live or on function.  So everything will look likep  precodedocument.onclick, SomeButton, function    codepre  pDoing it this way will cause there to be many hundreds and possibly over a thousand events being tied to a single element, the document.p  pPutting them in separate files requires multiple HTTP requests to be made to load the various pages of the site but limits the number of events that are attached to the document.p  pAny thoughts on what is best herep

Negative 6409 pReferring to UDP. Some would suggest that having a single port and thus bound socket per client, as seen in eg. Quake III, would be better for buffering incoming streams. Im not entirely sure I buy this.p  pIsnt it after all down to ones own code to make sure that the contents of those buffers are constantly consumed On my server, I plan to do this about 2030 times a second, and if my clients are pushing out packets at that same rate, I cant see how buffering would be a problem. FWIW, my packets will be up to 1024 bytes in length. Id have 4 or at most, 8 clients. I understand from a number of sources eg. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1507475winsockudppacketsbeingdroppedthis answera that the default buffer size on Windows is 8k. So with 4 clients, this should typically be okay, to my mind... though I guess I might need to up the buffer size somewhat, and am not sure if there are any pitfalls to that, though Im aware this is done via codesetsockoptcode.p

Negative 6409 pThe use of CustomListAdapter to dynamically fill in a ListView isnt exactly overdocumented It has been very difficult to find information on this, but I finally got it working.p  pAbstractly, in my listview CustomListAdapter, I populate a list showing a bunch of boxes and the contents of each.

But the list gets very long with all of those blank lines displayed. In the LinearLayouts with lt 4 items such as Box 1, if I try to shrink the empty vertical space by setting the unused TextViews visibility to Gone, the data gets jumbled up in unpredictable ways, i.e. diving mask will appear in Box 1 instead of Box 2, and the contents of Box 0 will vanish.p  pHas anyone else experienced this unpredictability when using x.VisibilityViewStates.Gone in a CustomListAdapter Is there a better way than setting Android.Views.ViewStates.Gone to get rid of the vertical space occupied by the unused TextViewsp

Due to the fact that I will have to do a lot more of this now and in future Ive decided to learn the correct way.p  pCan anyone recommend any good beginner and I mean beginner tutorials specifically for getting JSP to talk to Java via Servlets to get me startedp  pIm not really sure what I should be searching for to get the right resource but everything I seem to find at the moment seems to be provided by a content farm, incomplete, too advanced, skips the basic steps or using other languages or technologies.p  pI also have very little knowledge of Tomcat so anything that goes into detail about editing the WEBINF folder would be great.p  pAny help is as always, much appreciatedp

Negative 6409 pIm trying to implement a custom MKAnnotationView with a custom button inside. I dont want to use the callout property of the MKAnnotation because the frame for that view cant be accessed. Instead I used the MKAnnotationView view to add my UIView with my custom callout bubble inside. Everything works fine, even the touch is captured by the button. The only problem is in resizing the MKAnnotationView frame. Im able to do that during the codevoidsetSelectedBOOLselected animatedBOOLanimatedcode method inside my custom MKAnnotationView that subclasses MKAnnotationView, but when the resized view should display at MapView, thats only achieved by zooming in or out the map. Ive tried passing things such ascodeneedsLayoutcode and codeneedsDisplaycode but with no success.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Whats the method that the MapView calls when zooming in and out, so I can call it to refresh the custom MKAnnotationView framep  pHeres some code from the CustomMKAnnotationView class that Ive createdp  precode voidsetSelectedBOOLselected animatedBOOLanimated  [super setSelectedselected animatedanimated]  if selected        self.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, 170, 66      self.backgroundColor  [UIColor lightTextColor]      self.centerOffset  CGPointMake54.5, 33      self.image  nil      [self createBubble]      [self animateIn]      [self addSubviewbubbleView] else      [bubbleView removeFromSuperview]      self.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, 13, 17      self.centerOffset  CGPointMake0, 0    codepre
Negative 6409 pPlanning working on a 2D RTS, I tried to learn how Astar works. Indeed, I found articles explaining how Astar could be optimized coupling it with binary heaps, and algorithms taking advantages of Path symmetry, like a hrefhttpharablog.wordpress.com20110907jumppointsearch relnofollowJump Poin Search algorithma. I tried to a hrefhttpsgithub.comYonabaJumper relnofollowimplementa Jump Point Search, and it runs fine. I even made some benchmarks tests with maps from MovingAI.p  pYet there is a problem. Everything runs fine when diagonal moves are allowed.When disabled, no path is returned...p  pIt may be linked to the way I implementd it, then Im all asking...In general, how would you oblige the algorithm JPS to search for path involving only straight moves not diagonals moves to reach a goal p

Negative 6409 pIve posted before on this subject, but after a year of getting on with other things, Ive managed to get into a pickle once again. Ill try and give a brief overview of the scenario and the current attempts to make things workp  ul liIIS web server hosting HTML, JS etc. on host emiis.mycompany.comem referred to as emfooemli liWCF RESTful web services hosted via a Windows Service on host emwcf.mycompany.comem referred to as embaremli ul  pThe Javascript served from emfooem works by making RESTful ajax calls codeGETcode or codePOSTcode depending on the action to the WCF services on embarem, obviously these are cross domain calls as they arent on the same host.p  pThe Javascript uses the jQuery 1.7.2 framework to manipulate the DOM and perform ajax calls to embarem, the expected content type for codePOSTScode is codeJSONcode, and the response from codeGETScode is expected to be codeJSONcode too applicationjson.p  pemBarem has its WCF services configured using codeTransportCredentialOnlycode as the security mode and the transport client credentail type is codeNTLMcode, so only authed users to contact the services.p  pCORS Support has been added to embarsem WCF services using an extension to WCFp  pa hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combcarlosfigueiraarchive20120515implementingcorssupportinwcf.aspxhttpblogs.msdn.combcarlosfigueiraarchive20120515implementingcorssupportinwcf.aspxap  pWe have added additional headers and modfied some that the post already contained based on numerous internet articlesp  precodeproperty.Headers.AddAccessControlAllowHeaders, Accept, ContentType property.Headers.AddAccessControlAllowMethods, POST, GET, OPTIONS property.Headers.AddAccessControlMaxAge, 172800 property.Headers.AddAccessControlAllowOrigin, httpiis.mycompany.com property.Headers.AddAccessControlAllowCredentials, true property.Headers.AddContenttype, applicationjson codepre  pSites giving information on enabling CORS suggest that the codeAccessControlAllowOrigincode response header should be set to codecode however, this is not possible in our case as we make jQuery ajax calls using the following setupp  precode.ajaxSetup   cache false,   crossDomain true,   xhrFields      withCredentials true     codepre  pAs it turns out you cannot use codecode for the accepted origin when you are using codewithCredentialscode in the ajax callp  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenhttpaccesscontrolhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenhttpaccesscontrolap  blockquote   pImportant note when responding to a credentialed request,  server   must specify a domain, and cannot use wild carding.p blockquote  pCurrently in our development lab, this doesnt matter as we can hard code the requests to the IIS foo server URL.p  pThe main problem now appears to be attempting codePOSTcode requests codeGETcode is working using the above configuration. When the browser attempts the codePOSTcode process, it first sends an codeOPTIONScode header to the server requesting allowed codeOPTIONScode for the subsequent post. This is where we would like to see the headers weve configured in the CORS Support WCF extension being passed back, however we arent getting that far before the response comes  back as em401 Unauthorizedem, I believe this is to do with the transport security binding configuration requesting NTLM, but Im not sure. p  pAlso, Im not very experienced with this, but I havent seen much information about codePOSTcode using codeapplicationjsoncode content type as opposed to codetextplaincode when performing cross domain requests.p  pI know that people will probably suggest codeJSONPcode as the one true solution, Im not against different approaches, indeed I encourage anyone to suggest best practices as it would help others reading this question later. However, please attempt to answer the question before suggestion alternatives to it.p  pMany thanks in advance for anyone who contributes.p  ppeteski p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIt appears that Chrome 20.x.x doesnt suffer the problem of not negotiating NTLM to retrieve the codeOPTIONScode header response from the server, but Firefox 13.0.1 does. p  pWeve also noticed that someone has already posted a bug up on the Firefox forum, which weve added information top  pa hrefhttpbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid751552httpbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid751552a p  pstrongPlease vote for this bug to be fixed on the bugzilla sitestrongp  pUsing the following code, we can watch the network trace to see Firefox failing and Chrome working fine p  precodevar url  httpmyWebServiceServerInstantMessagingServicechatmessagesend var data   remoteUserUri  sipfoo.barmydomain.com, message  This is my message              var request  new XMLHttpRequest                      request.openPOST, url, true request.withCredentials  true request.setRequestHeaderContentType, applicationjson                    request.senddata                      console.logrequest codepre  pOn a separate note, IE8 doesnt support the codeXMLHttpRequestcode for cross domain calls, favouring its own magical codeXDomainRequestcode object, so weve got some work to do in changing the client side code to handle IE8 vs the world cases. Thanks IE8.p  pemme crosses fingers that Mozilla fix the Firefox bug.emp  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pAfter some digging it appears that IE8s codeXDomainRequestcode cannot be used to make cross domain requests where NTLM must be negotiated, this basically means that the security on our WCF binding cant be used thanks to limitations in a web browser.p  pa hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combieinternalsarchive20100513xdomainrequestrestrictionslimitationsandworkarounds.aspxhttpblogs.msdn.combieinternalsarchive20100513xdomainrequestrestrictionslimitationsandworkarounds.aspxap  blockquote   pNo authentication or cookies will be sent with the requestp blockquote  pSo, I guess weve taken this as far as it is going to go for now.. It looks like were going to have to create our own custom token authentication and pass it across to the WCF service in a cookie, or in IE8s case, codePOSTcode it with the JSON. The WCF service will then have to handle decrypting the data and using that instead of the codeServiceSecurityContext.Current.WindowsIdentitycode we previously had access to with NTLM auth.p

Negative 6409 pOur team is implementing a VNC viewer VNC client on Windows.  The protocol called RFB is stateful, meaning that the viewer has to read 1 byte, see what it is, then read either 3 or 10 bytes more, parse them, and so on.p  pWeve decided to use asynchronous sockets and a single UI thread. Consequently, there are 2 ways to go  p  p1 state machine  if we get a block on socket reading, just remember the current state and quit. Later on, a socket notification will arrive and the interrupted logic will resume from the proper stagep  p2 inner message loop  once we determine that reading from the socket would block, we enter an inner message loop and spin there until all the necessary data is finally received. UI is not thus frozen in case of a block.p  pAs experience showed, the second approach is bad, as any message can come while were in the inner message loop.  I cannot tell the full story here, but it simply is not reliable enough. Crashes and kludges.p  pThe first option seems to be quite acceptable, but it is not easy to program in such a style.  One has to remember the state of an algorithm and values of all the local variables required for further processing.p  pThis is quite possible to use multiple threads, but we just thought that the problems in this case would be even much harder synchronization of framebuffer access, multithreading issues, etc.  Moreover, even in this variant it seems necessary to use asynchronous sockets as well.p  pSo, what way is in your opinion the best p  pThe problem is quite a general one.  This is the problem of organizing asynchronous communication through stateful protocols.p  pstrongEdit 1strong We use C and MFC as UI framework.p

The main purpose of this app is managing the various PDFS, Images and documents to all of the parts we manufacture. Our ASP application uses a few third party tools to allow viewing of these files. We currently have 980GB of data on the Fileserver. We have around 200GB of Binary data in SQL Server that we would like to extract since it is not performing well hence FILESTREAM seems to be a good compromise to the two major data storageaccess issues.p  pA few things are not exactly clear to usp  ol lipFILESTREAM Can or Cannot store its data on a drive that is not locally attached. We already have a File Server with a RAID 10 1.5TB drives. This server stores all of the documents right now, would we have to move these drives to the SQL Server for FILESTREAM That would be a tough bullet to bite since the server also is doubling as the Application Server Two VMs on one physical server.pli lipFILETABLE stores the common metadata about the files but where is the Full Text part of it stored to allow searching of files like docdocx Is this separate Are you able to freely add criteria to this to search by If so any links to clarify would be appreciated.pli lipCan FILETABLE be referenced in another table with a foreign keypli ol  pThank you in advancep  pEDIT For those having these questions this web video covered everything and more in terms of explaining filestream from 2008 to 2012 and the cavets to consider I would seriously rep him if I could a hrefhttpchannel9.msdn.comEventsTechDaysTechdays2012theNetherlands2270 relnofollowhttpchannel9.msdn.comEventsTechDaysTechdays2012theNetherlands2270ap  pIn conclusion we will not be using FILESTREAM as it would be way to huge of an upsurge to accommodate for investment.p  pEDIT 2 p  pUpdate to 1  After carefully assessing FileTable in addition to FILESTREAM we got a winning combination. We did have to move the files over to the new server wasnt to painful since they were on the same VM.It honestly took more time to write an extraction tool to dump the binary data within SQL to the File System.p  pUpdate to 2  This was seperate but again Bob had an excellent webinar explaining this a hrefhttpchannel9.msdn.comEventsTechEdEurope2012DBI411 relnofollowhttpchannel9.msdn.comEventsTechEdEurope2012DBI411ap  pUpdate to 3  Using TFT inheritance we recycled the Docs table we had minus the huge binary blobs which required very little changes in our legacy apps. This was a huge upshot for the developer team.p

Negative 6409 pI am running out of ideas here.  I have a piece of code adapted from a hrefhttpthetechnofreak.comtechnofreakkeyloggervisualc relnofollowhttpthetechnofreak.comtechnofreakkeyloggervisualca to convert keycodes to unicode chars.  It works fine in all situations except when you try to run the 32bit version from 64bit Windows.  For some reason pKbdpVkToWcharTable keeps returning NULL.  I have tried ptr64 as well as explicitly specifying SysWOW64 and System32 for the kbd dll path.  I have found several items across the internet referring to this exact or very similar problem but I cannot seem to get any of the solutions to work See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10398072kbdlayerdescriptorreturnsnullat64bitarchitectureKbdLayerDescriptor returns NULL at 64bit architecturea  The following is my test code that was compiled with mingw32 on Windows XP gcc stdc99 Wow64Test.c and then executed on Windows 7 64bit.  On Windows XP I am getting a valid pointer, however on Windows 7 I am getting NULL.p  pUpdate So it looks like the problems I am having are due to mingw not implementing ptr64 correctly as the sizeof operation gives 4 bytes instead of the 8 bytes given by visual studio.  So the real solution would be figuring out a way to make the size of KBDLONGPOINTER dynamic or at least 64bits but I am not sure if thats possible.

Negative 6409 pIs there any way I can write to a file that is being used by another process I have a windows service that creates logs and locks the file until the service is stopped.

Negative 6409 pIm leading a small software development team 4 people, and have just broken ground on a sourcecontrolled SQL Server 2008 database project, with isolated development databases for each developer. Im still implementing this one step at a time, but Im envisioning each developer having their own database, with a naming scheme something like codeltProjectNamegtDEVELOPMENTltTFSUserNamegtcode. This was all recommended per the MSDN articles Ive been reading, but someone let me know if that sounds way off.p  pAnyway, we have a shared application solution that weve been developing for some time. In the past, we had no database version control, and just modified our database directly from SQL Server Management Studio when new reference data needed to be populated, or when we were testing functionality  one change immediately affected everyone else. So with this new change, Im wondering what the best way would be to have each person connect to their isolated development databases from the application solution. Prior to isolated databases, our connection to the database was specified in our applications web.config as a connection string. If were each going to have our own database, the only way I can see it working is for each developer to set their connection string in their local solution to point to their personal database. But changing the web.config will check out that file in the solution, so developers will always have to specifically uncheck that file when checking in application changes to the baseline. Is there a less clunky way for each developer to use their isolated database when doing application testingp

I believe this problem also applies to regular Backbone Views and Marionette ItemViews as well though.p  pIn summary, I have a parent view. When it is initialized, it creates two child layouts that are meant to be used as tab content. The problem is that when tab content from one tab is shown, then content from another tab is shown instead, when the original tab content is shown again, the events do not work anymore.p  pThe child layouts are created in the codeinitializecode function of the parent layout and reused because their states need to be preserved when navigation moves back to them.p  pHere is a a hrefhttps3.amazonaws.combsldmpublicfilesmarionetteshowhideindex.htmlsample applicationa that demonstrates what I am talking aboutp  pa hrefhttps3.amazonaws.combsldmpublicfilesmarionetteshowhideindex.htmlimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comz7MWu.gif altenter image description hereap  pHere is a video showing the broken events a hrefhttps3.amazonaws.combsldmpublicfilesmarionetteshowhidefilessoquestionmarionettetabs.swfVideo Linkap  pThanks so muchp

And when I go back into VS and try to create a new Portable Class Library, it lists the same target frameworks as before.p  pI have also turned on the Windows Features for .NET Framework 3.5 and am now out of ideas. Here is a screen shot in case I missed something else.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeWHWk.png altWindows Featuresp  pThanks,p
Negative 6409 pI want to write some C code to initialize my database with some seed data.  Clearly, this is going to require the ability to be able to set the values of various Identity columns when inserting.  Im using a codefirst approach.  By default, codeDbContextcode handles the database connection and so you cant codeSET IDENTITYINSERT [dbo].[MyTable] ONcode.  So, what Ive done so far is use the codeDbContextcode constructor that lets me specify a DB connection to be used.  Then, I set codeIDENTITYINSERTcode to codeONcode in that DB connection, and then try to insert my records using entity framework.  Heres an example of what Ive got so farp  precodepublic class MyUserSeeder  IEntitySeeder      public void InitializeEntitiesAssessmentSystemContext context, SqlConnection connection          context.MyUsers.Addnew MyUser  MyUserId  106, ConceptPersonId  520476, Salutation  Mrs, Firstname  Novelette, Surname  Aldred, Email  null, LoginId  520476, Password28c923d21b68fdf129b46de949b9f7e0d03f6ced8e9404066f4f3a75e115147489c9f68195c2128e320ca9018cd711df, IsEnabled  true, SpecialRequirements  null          try              connection.Open             SqlCommand cmd  new SqlCommandSET IDENTITYINSERT [dbo].[MyUser] ON, connection             int retVal  cmd.ExecuteNonQuery             context.SaveChanges                  finally              connection.Close                codepre  pSo close and yet so far  because, although codecmd.ExecuteNonQuerycode works fine, when I then run codecontext.SaveChangescode, Im informed that Explicit value must be specified for identity column in table MyUser either when IDENTITYINSERT is set to ON or when a replication user is inserting into a NOT FOR REPLICATION identity column.p  pPresumably, because MyUserId which is the Identity column in the MyUser table is the primary key, entity framework doesnt try to set it when I call codecontext.SaveChangescode, even though I gave the codeMyUsercode entity a value for the codeMyUserIdcode property.p  pIs there a way to force entity framework to try and insert even primary key values for an entity, then  Or maybe a way to temporarily mark codeMyUserIdcode as not being a primary key value, so EF tries to insert itp

Negative 6409 pI am new to setting up geocoding on a Google Map Page and I am using examples from the book Map Scripting 101. I am attempting to bring up a static address that is geocoded on a Google Map.  I tried to transfer the code to my own html page and it will not work.  I substituted my Google API key, and the paths to my mapstraction directory is correct. I am definitely in the correct website to use my code as I have no problems with my Google API working with other maps.  The problem is just the geocoding of a static address in the html code.p  pI think I have set up all the proper services when I obtained my Google API.  However I am not clear if there is a special API service that is needed for geocoding in addition to making standard maps.   p  pHere is the HTML code that I cannot get to work.

As the angle approaches 90 degrees the collision area seems to at first move to the right half of the OBB and then become non existent. Between 90 and 270 I couldnt get an overlap and then when it comes round a full 360 the area registers accurately again.p  pAny light on this subject would be great. Im using positive X for 0 degrees increasing CCW.p  pCheers.p  pEDIT Did a little more research and realised that projecting a vector onto another requires more than just a dot product. Could any one give me a correct version of one of the check axis methods below pretty pretty please p  pEDIT 2 Actually just a dot product should do I think since the vectors being projected onto are unit length.p  precodepublic static bool overlapAABBOBBAABB a, OBB o              float rads  MathHelper.ToRadianso.angle         T  Vector2.Subtracto.position, a.position         Ax.X  1         Ax.Y  0         Ay.X  0         Ay.Y  1         Ox.X  floatMath.Cosrads         Ox.Y  floatMath.Sinrads         Oy.X  Ox.Y         Oy.Y  Ox.X         if checkAXa, o ampamp            checkAYa, o ampamp            checkOXa, o ampamp            checkOYa, o             return true         else             return false           private static bool checkAXAABB a, OBB o              float TAx  Vector2.DotT, Ax         float WoOxAx  Vector2.DotVector2.MultiplyOx, o.halfWidth, Ax         float HoOyAx  Vector2.DotVector2.MultiplyOy, o.halfHeight, Ax         if TAx gt a.halfWidth  WoOxAx  HoOyAx             return false         else             return true           private static bool checkAYAABB a, OBB o              float TAy  Vector2.DotT, Ay         float WoOxAy  Vector2.DotVector2.MultiplyOx, o.halfWidth, Ay         float HoOyAy  Vector2.DotVector2.MultiplyOy, o.halfHeight, Ay         if TAy gt a.halfHeight  WoOxAy  HoOyAy             return false         else             return true           private static bool checkOXAABB a, OBB o              float TOx  Vector2.DotT, Ox         float WaAxOx  Vector2.DotVector2.MultiplyAx, a.halfWidth, Ox         float HaAyOx  Vector2.DotVector2.MultiplyAy, a.halfHeight, Ox         if TOx gt o.halfHeight  WaAxOx  HaAyOx             return false         else             return true           private static bool checkOYAABB a, OBB o              float TOy  Vector2.DotT, Oy         float WaAxOy  Vector2.DotVector2.MultiplyAx, a.halfWidth, Oy         float HaAyOy  Vector2.DotVector2.MultiplyAy, a.halfHeight, Oy         if TOy gt o.halfHeight  WaAxOy  HaAyOy             return false         else             return true      codepre

Negative 6409 pI am implementing a Table for iPad and facing some major problems.p  pFor the GridView I implemented my own subclass of UITableViewCell which works fine.p  pThe data is shown correctly, but I have a problem when I want to access a single cell to go to some new detail view. Since one row only contains one cell, the didSelectRowAtIndexPath only gives me access to the complete cell, but I dont know which column the single cell is in.p  pThen I implemented a TapGestureRecognizer. This shows me the row and column and works, but only until I start scrolling... the column part still works, but the row is shown incorrect since the TapRecognizer overlaps the didSelectRowAtIndexPath bad but not so important side effect.. there is no blue highlighting of the selected row. p  pIs there a way to find out how many pixels I scrolled Or is there an even better solutionp

Negative 6409 pPlease forgive me if this has been answered already but Ive searched a lot and still require some clarification.p  pIm building a Property Management tool using Rails 3.2. I already have a User model and authorisationauthentication code in place with full tests coverage.p  pIve just started drawing out the modelsclassestables and have gotten myself a bit confused.p  pLets start with Users.p  h2Modelling Usersh2  pI plan to have allow multiple companies to use this system. Each will have employees users. These users will have different roles e.g. Manager, Agent, Accountant, Secretary etc. For the most part the data I plan to store for each of these users will be similar or so I think at the moment so I am leaning towards Single Table Inheritance and using the type to define the level of access each employee has.p  pSecondly, I plan to allow Landlord and Tenants to also log in to the system. Upon logging in theyll be able to view information about the property they are owning or renting  maybe keep their contact details up to date too.p  pI was thinking of using polymorphic associations to represent these users.p  pSo the plan I have at the moment and would like some feedback on is to havep  pUser lt ActiveRecordBASEp  pEmployee lt User this will have a STI type column and allow for the different employee rolesp  pLandlord lt Userp  pTenant lt Userp  pIs this the best way of approaching this problem or am I shooting myself in the footp  pIve had some people advise me I should have a roles table and assign roles to the users  but I have a feeling this isnt the most elegant way to do this in Rails.p  h2Propertiesh2  pMy next issue is with Properties. Right now I have a model for properties and when I add them they belongto a User i.e. they have a userid foreign key. I then started thinking what happens if the employee user that added the Property leaves the company or has their account deleted for some reasonp  pSo in this scenario is it best to forgo the UserEmployee to Property association and just link the Property to the Company that the employee belongs to This way I can all employee.company.properties to list out all the propertiesp  h2Landlord and Tenant associationsh2  pLets presume we make Properties belong to a Company.p  pIn terms of associations this is what I have in my head. Looking at it now I see that everything belongs to a company because one company using the system shouldnt be able to see the landlordstenantsemployeesproperties of another company.p  precodeclass Landlord lt User   belongsto company   hasmany properties, through gt ownerships end  class Tenant lt User   belongsto company   hasone property, through gt tenancies you can only live at one place at a time right end  class Property lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany tenants, through gt tenancies   hasmany landlords, through gt ownerships   belongsto company end  class Company lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany properties   hasmany employees   hasmany landlords through gt ownerships not sure if through is requiredworks here   hasmany tenants through gt tenancies not sure if through is requiredworks here end  class Employees lt User   belongsto company end codepre  h2Propertiesh2  pAlso Im guessing well have different types of Properties CommercialResidential and of those there will be whole buildings, apartments within a building single address etc.p  pLike with users Im planning on using Polymorphic Associations to define two subclasses CommercialProperty and ResidentialProperty and then use sti to define a type. If the type is multi unit then have a new model for units and an association whereby Property hasmany Units and a Unit belongsto a property.p  h2Aimh2  pIm trying to make sure that my code follows best practice as much as possible so that when I come to add new features and expand Im not left having to rewrite large chunks of the app.p  pI would really appreciate your feedback.p  h2Referenceh2  pSome of the posts Ive read. Hopefully to help others trying to solve the same problem.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7719600designingarailsapplicationsingletableinheritanceDesigning a Rails application single table inheritanceap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2586329rubyonrailswithdifferntusertypesRuby on rails with differnt user typesap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3956588rubyonrailsusermodelformultipletypesRuby On Rails User Model for multiple typesap

The problem now is that whatever I select in the first selection, the second one will not be updated, it always return null.p  pNot sure where the prob is, the code looks fine  Thanks for any help.p  pdemo pagep  precodelthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt   lttitlegtReservation Systemlttitlegt        ltlink hrefjqueryuicsssunnyjqueryui1.8.16.custom.css relstylesheet typetextcssgt      ltlink hrefjquerydatatablescssmrbspage.css relstylesheet typetextcssgt     ltlink hrefjquerydatatablescssmrbstable.css relstylesheet typetextcssgt     ltlink hrefjquerydatatablescssColReorder.css relstylesheet typetextcssgt     ltlink hrefjquerydatatablescssColVis.css relstylesheet typetextcssgt      ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssmrbs.css.php typetextcssgt         ltlink relstylesheet mediaprint hrefcssmrbsprint.css.php typetextcssgt     ltmeta namerobots contentnoindexgt  ltscript typetextjavascript srcjqueryjquery1.7.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjqueryuijqueryui1.8.22.custom.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjqueryuijqueryuii18n.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjqueryuijqueryuidatepickeren.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjqueryuijqueryuidatepickerenUS.jsgtltscriptgt    ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquerydatatablesjsjquery.dataTables.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquerydatatablesjsColReorder.min.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt        var xmlhttp        var url        function createXMLHttpRequest            if window.XMLHttpRequest              xmlhttp  new XMLHttpRequest           else              xmlhttp  new ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP                 function showConfigstr            url  getOptions.phptypestr           createXMLHttpRequest           xmlhttp.openGET,url,true           xmlhttp.sendnull            xmlhttp.onreadystatechange  function handleStateChange                  function handleStateChange            if xmlhttp.readyState  4 ampamp xmlhttp.status  200                            var str  xmlhttp.responseText                 alert url                 createConfigstr                              function createConfigstr            var configs  str           var config  configs.split,           while document.getElementByIdconfig.options.lengtgt0                  document.getElementByIdconfig.options.remove0           for var i0 iltconfig.length i                            var ooption  document.createElementoption                 ooption.value  config[i]                 ooption.text  config[i]                 document.getElementByIdconfig.addooption                      ltscriptgt  ltform idaddroom classformadmin actionadd.php methodpostgt       ltfieldsetgt       ltlegendgtAdd DCAltlegendgt         ltinput typehidden nametype valueroomgt         ltinput typehidden namearea value2gt          ltdivgt           ltlabel forroomnamegtNameltlabelgt           ltinput typetext idroomname namename maxlength50gt         ltdivgt          ltdivgt           ltlabel forroomdescriptiongtDescriptionltlabelgt           ltinput typetext idroomdescription namedescription maxlength100gt         ltdivgt          ltdivgt           ltlabel forroomtypegtTypeltlabelgt           ltselect classroomareaselect idtypeselect namearea onchangeshowConfigthis.valuegtltoption  valueVMgtVMltoptiongtltoption  valueServergtServerltoptiongtltoption  valueDCAV1gtDCAV1ltoptiongtltoption  valueDCAV2gtDCAV2ltoptiongtltselectgt         ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltlabel for  configgtconfigltlabelgt         ltselect idconfig gtltselectgt        ltdivgt        ltfieldsetgt     ltformgt codepre  pgetOptions.php filep  precodeltphp type  GET[type] echo type result   if type  DCAV1         for i0ilt47           result . i.,        result . 48   else if type  Server        result . single node  else if type  VM         result . single host  echo result gt codepre

Negative 6409 pSo Im creating a roster app for my coed softball team.  The league rules say that if two guys bat in a row, a girl has to follow.  This leads to problems if the guy girl ratio is not balanced, eg if there are 4 girls and 14 guys, at least one of the girls will have to bat twice in the same run through the batting order in order to satisfy the guy guy girl rule, and then she has to be placed at the back of the queue of girls, so the next time through the  second girl moves up to the first girl spot, the third to the second, etc etc.  So by the third or fourth inning were frantically scribbling the modified batting order on the back of a receipt or something as we try to keep track of whos batting when.p  pThe purpose, then, of the app Im creating is to allow the user to enter in a batting order, press a button, and see that batting order extrapolated over, say, four times through the order obv user can decide how many, moving the girls in the lineup accordingly.p  pSo far, the app allows you to add players, set their gender, and put them in a desired order.  This is all tracked in a database.  Now Im up to the press a button, see x amount of times through the order.  What I have works, assuming that the order is strictly guy guy girl.  But it cant handle any variation in that, eg the initial order is guy girl guy guy or girl guy guy.  The logic Ive coded just ignores that and changes it to guy guy girl.p  pWhat logic could I use to correctly handle any initial batting orderp  pHeres my codep  precodepos  numerical position in the roster public void computeKickingOrder      String TAG  cKO      instantiate dbhandler     DatabaseHandler db  new DatabaseHandlerthis       get all tasks     ListltPlayergt players  db.getAllPlayers     ListltPlayergt guys  new ArrayListltPlayergt     ListltPlayergt girls  new ArrayListltPlayergt     ListltPlayergt theRoster  new ArrayListltPlayergt      int pCount  players.size     int cycles  4     Log.dTAG, Total Players   pCount      Log.dTAG, Generating   cycles   runs through the order.      one cycle  guycount  guycount2      IteratorltPlayergt itr  players.iterator     IteratorltPlayergt itr       first cycle through the whole roster and separate out guys and girls      use cycles  5 to ensure that there are plenty of players available in each list      for int i  0  i lt cycles  5  i          itr  players.iterator         whileitr.hasNext              Player p  itr.next             ifp.getGender.equalsM  guys.addp              else  girls.addp                     Log.dTAG, guys.size   guys.size     Log.dTAG, girls.size   girls.size         below code automatically creates guy guy girl order IGNORES that a girl might be first or second     int girlSpot  0     int guyKicks  1     int pos  1     forint i0 iltguys.size i          ifguyKickslt3              Player p  guys.geti             p.setPospos             theRoster.addp             guyKicks             Log.dTAG, pos      p.getGender      p.getName                    else              guyKicks  1             Player p  girls.getgirlSpot             p.setPospos             theRoster.addp             girlSpot             Log.dTAG, pos      p.getGender      p.getName                   pos       codepre

Negative 6409 pI have a small value class that I create lots of instances of. Often with the same value. This class is used as a kind of identifier, so the main use is comparing instances of this class with each other via codeisEqualcode. p  pTo save some memory and time comparing I keep only unique instances in a codeNSHashTablecode and use pointer comparison instead of codeisEqualcode.p  pSo my designated initializer looks like thisp  precode initWithStuff NSString stuff      self  [super init]     if self return nil       ... actual initialisation code omitted     hash  UniquingHashTable     static OSSpinLock spinlock  OSSPINLOCKINIT    OSSpinLockLock ampspinlock      id member  [hash member self]    if member self  member    else [hash addObject self]     OSSpinLockUnlock ampspinlock      return self  codepre  pcodeUniquingHashTablecode returns the global codeNSHashTablecode or creates it via code[NSHashTable weakObjectsHashTable]code if it doesnt exist yet. The codeweakObjectsHashTablecode is the important bit  it stores weak pointers to the objects that automatically get removed once there is no other strong reference to that object. The initialization is threadsafe thanks to codedispatchoncecode.p  pThis works fine, peak memory usage is significantly lower and all my test cases still pass.  But I am not quite sure if I can rely on pointercomparison to test for equality. emIs there any case or race condition where I get two distinct instances at the same time so the pointers are different but they still compare equal by codeisEqualcodeemp  h3To clarify what I havewanth3  pGivenp  precodeMyClass a  [[MyClass alloc] initWithStuff stringA] MyClass b  [[MyClass alloc] initWithStuff stringB] codepre  pwe always havep  precode[a isEqual b]  [stringA isEqual stringB] codepre  pThis is not changed with the new code.p  pWhat I am trying to achieve is that alsop  precode[a isEqual b]  a  b codepre  pso that I can replace the codeisEqualcode with a faster pointer comparison. Yes, I measured this, this will be significant.p  pFor single threaded code or if I was using a codeNSMutableSetcode instead of a weak codeNSHashTablecode this always works out.

Negative 6409 pIs there a simple way of reordering sending to top the exiting DOM elements before removingp  pThe reason I want to do this is that there is no other zindex rendering order other than DOM order.

The Spork.prefork block is run only once when the spork server is started.  You typically want to place most of your slow initializer code in here, in  particular, requireing any 3rdparty gems that you dont normally modify  during development.   The Spork.eachrun block is run each time you run your specs.  In case you  need to load files that tend to change during development, require them here.  With Rails, your application modules are loaded automatically, so sometimes  this block can remain empty.   Note You can modify files loaded from the Spork.eachrun block without  restarting the spork server.  However, this file itself will not be reloaded,  so if you change any of the code inside the eachrun block, you still need to  restart the server.  In general, if you have nontrivial code in this file,  its advisable to move it into a separate file so you can easily edit it  without restarting spork.  For example, with RSpec, you could move  nontrivial code into a file specsupportmyhelper.rb, making sure that the  specsupport files are required from inside the eachrun block.   Any code that is left outside the two blocks will be run during preforking  and during eachrun  thats probably not what you want.   These instructions should selfdestruct in 10 seconds.

Negative 6409 pIm building a CakePHP Student Management System to be used by large Universities50.000 users, and im wondering what is the best way for implementing the Access Control Stuff.p  pThe University has many faculties, the faculties as many departments and the departments as many sections and so on...

The same applies to departments under faculties.p  pAlso, there will be teachers that can only access data from the students belonging to their classroomsp  pAnd there will be students that can only access their personal data and events belonging to their classroomsp  pCan you help me designing the access control strategy for this system Im already using CakePHP ACL, but i dont know if it is the good stratey to go.p
Negative 6409 pstrongA synopsis of my questionstrongp  pIs it possible to use your own, custom variables the way that you can use [TARGETDIR] in the Registry screen of a Windows Setup project in VS2010 Specifically, I need to store my assemblys strong name and assembly version in the registry, in order to register a COM object on a machine without the installing user having admin rights.p  pI already tried using a custom action, and Id rather not continue down that road if possible.p  pstrongHere are the specifics, and what Ive triedstrongp  pRecently, my employer started blindly removing all employees admin rights from their machines.p  pI had created a COMexposed C class that Id been using on a few of my workstations, which is no longer able to be registered, because I no longer have the appropriate permissions under HKEYCLASSESROOT.p  pThrough Googling, I found out how to register all of the appropriate keys under HKCU, but now Id like to implement this in my deployment project.p  pI understand how to use the Registry screen within Windows Setup, but there are custom keysvalues that need to be stored install folder, assembly strong name, version.p  pI could use a custom action, but ideally, I want Windows Setup to manage my registry settings, because a its better than I am at automatically removing all the proper keysvalues upon uninstall, b during the install, registry changes are transactional amp rolled back upon install error, and c the logic for registry key installremovaltransactions is already written by Microsoft, and I wont have to rewrite it myself.p  pThe project was in VS2008 until today, but I just upgraded it to VS2010, so perhaps something has changed between 2008 and 2010 that might allow this behavior.p  pSo, rather than using a custom action, is there a better way to do thisp  pstrongEDITstrong I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1801639864414thisa answer, which seems to suggest that you can access the Windows Install Registry table within your install project.

Negative 6409 pIm putting together a simple chess position evaluation function. This being the first time for me building a chess engine, I am feeling very tentative with putting in just any evaluation function. The one shown on a hrefhttpchessprogramming.wikispaces.comEvaluationWhere20to20Start relnofollowthis Chess Programming Wiki pagea looks like a good candidate. However this has an ellipsis at the end which makes me unsure of whether it will be a good one to usep  pOnce the whole engine is in place and functional, I intend to come back to the evaluation function and make a real attempt to sorting it out properly. But for now I need some sort of function which is good enough to play against an average amateur. p

Negative 6409 pI need to find some text in around 120 text files, I want to know which will be the best and fastest way to search text. Am I supposed to read each file in a RichTextBox then use its methods to search text or should I be reading those files into a string variable and then searching using regular expressions  p  pI think the major factor behind performance is to find a way so that there is no need to loop through the lines which have already been tested for match. Is there any way to find all the matches in a file in one go Does anyone knows a way to find matches in text files as Visual Studio does It searched 200 text files for match in around 8001000 Milliseconds. I think it makes use of multiple threads to accomplish this.p

Negative 6409 pIm using a basic UINavigationController design for the settings pages of an app.  Each settings page is its own view controller with xib, and each page has the same background image.  p  pIve since built a viewbased animation to replace the background image, and Id like it to play uninterrupted while the user moves from page to page.  In other words, its as though each settings page had a transparent background, and beneath all of them was a single instance of my animating view.p  pHow would I go about doing this  p  pSo far, Ive tried just putting the animation on each page separately, but the transitions look a bit too sloppy for me.  Id also considered somehow having a single UIView with all necessary animations underneath my navigation controller, but not sure a if thats feasible, and b how to go about that.p  pThanks for reading.p
Negative 6409 pTo preface this question, I am very VERY new to htmlCSS so go easy on me please p  pI am currently designing a webpage that has a fixed position header at the top.  The header contains a logo, some dropdown menus, and a right floated container showing the name of the person currently logged in.p  pThe problem that happens is if I resize the screen to be smaller, the elements of the header wrap onto the next line.p  pThe gray background is a parent div holding the logo, the drop down menus, and the logged in info with a width of 100, a fixed height and fixed position.  I initially had the logo and the list of menus set to floatleft to keep them inline, but have been playing around with displayinlineblock to see if that can help anything sadly, it hasnt much.  The container all the way on the right holding Logged in as Alex  is set to float rightp  pI have tried giving the header bar a fixed width, as well as setting its overflow to auto  neither option fixed the problem.p  pIn my perfect world, at the point where the content begins to wrap now, I would like the entire page to horizontally scroll instead of pushing the content to the next line.  A good example of the functionality Im looking for is the top bar on Youtube, where the items squish together as you minimize the screen and the page starts to scroll horizontally when they cant be squished any closer.p  pIve been struggling with this for many hours over the last few days, and happy help or direction would be greatly appreciated.

So in the .ps1 file that the parent .ps1 script created, the code then looks like thisp  precodeElseIfstr.StartsWithDRIVERDATEstr  DRIVERDATEGetDate  f MMddyyyy codepre  pwhich will not run properly if it is run.p  pSo does anybody know how to textformat scriptblocks so that they can be properly written to another child script file for further execution I did some research and I think that it might have something to do with PSs internal text buffer width or something. I tried other outfile methods as well like [System.IO.StreamWriter], however all of them look the samewrapped and limited to a certain width per line.p  blockquote   pPlease help me, thank youp blockquote  pThe entire purpose of this thing is to generate some scripts automatically and remotely execute these created scripts on other machines.p
Negative 6409 pWhat Im trying to do is paint a solid color andor pattern with some degree of opacity over an existing image. I believe from what Ive read this will involve a bitmap mask.  The examples Ive seen using bitmap masks as opacity masks only show them used against images to crop them a certain way, and I want to use it for painting.  Here is basically what Im trying to accomplishp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhKLW0.jpg alt1. image, 2. mask, 3. resultp  pThe first image is being loaded and drawn onto a derived Canvas class using DrawImage.  Im trying to accomplish what you see in the 3rd image, the 2nd is an example of a mask I might use.  The two key points being that the blue surface in the 3rd image needs to be any arbitrary color, and it needs some opacity so that you can still see the shading on the underlying image.  This is kind of a simple example, some of the other objects have much more surface detail and much more complicated masks.p

Negative 6409 pSo weve all probably seen Facebooks method of removing messenger chat heads from the view, I want to implement a similar method of deletion, however to collection view cells within a collection view. When there is a long press on a cell, a box would appear at the bottom of the view and the user would be able to drag the cell to the box for deletion, or simply let go of the select cell and thus returning to it original position and state. p  pI am aware of two libraries that allow collection view cells to be dragged around and reordered and was going to attempt to use those to implement such a feature, however they allow complete reordering of cells within a collection view and I figured there may be an existing library for implementing my desired feature, or a simpler method.p  pSo basically my question is, whats the best method of implementing this feature into a collection view and if you are aware of a library that allows this easily, itd be great if you could share it.p  pCode examples are always welcome and make things a lot easier.p  pCollection view cell reordering libraries a hrefhttpsgithub.comlxcidLXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout relnofollow titleLXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayoutLXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayouta and a hrefhttpsgithub.comlukescottDraggableCollectionView relnofollow titleDraggableCollectionViewDraggableCollectionViewap  pI understand how to go about deleting the collection view cells, im more interested in the method of deletion. p

Negative 6409 pI developed a stored procedure that queries a linked server, puts the result into a temp table, computes medians with two grouping columns and upserts the results into a table. The Maquina and Artigo fields are varchar30, while TempoUnitario is a float.

Negative 6409 pIm adding rows to a grid in the code behind, but each time some of the rows at the end get displayed on top of each other overlapping as though they were in the same row. I know that the row numbers Im setting are not the same, and that each row has a height of auto. p  pThe grid has no fixed height but is within a tab header of fixed height. Im using a scroll bar with the grid and that works fine it expands when I add more items, but there are always some number of rows at the end that are overlapping. So its not like the grid is only accepting a fixed number or is staying at a fixed length. Even if I add a few rows, and the grid only takes up half the screen, the last couple of rows will be overlapping at the end. p  pNothing I try to do with the grid seems to change anything  I tried setting the height to auto, to a fixed height, it was all the same.

Negative 6409 pI have a query on the significance of codeOMXIndexParamVideoAvccode for an codeOMXcode video decoder. Specifically, my query is Should an codeOMX Video Decodercode support the index codeOMXIndexParamVideoAvccode as part of codegetcode and codesetcode functionalitiesp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pFrom my understanding, this index is more useful from a codevideo encodercode perspective, as this is employed by an codeOMXIL Clientcode to query the underlying component on the existing support and further configure the encoder as the clients needs.p  pFrom a specification perspective, I observe that the specification does indicate the support for index codeOMXIndexParamVideoAvccode on codeVPB0code for a video decoder as in page 359 of the a hrefhttpwww.khronos.orgfilesopenmaxilspec112.pdf relnofollowspecificationa. In this section, only codeprofilecode and codelevelcode are populated. p  pPotentially I feel that this index could be employed for codeOMXGetParametercode to retrieve the max. profile and level supported by the component. However, the same could also be retrieved from codeOMXIndexParamVideoProfileLevelQuerySupportedcode.p  pHence,my main doubts arep  ol lipShould an codeOMX video decodercode support the index codeOMXIndexParamVideoAvccode pli lipIf this index is supported, then what should be the default values when an codeOMXILcode client queries the same, say in codeLOADEDcode state pli lipThe point where this index could logically be filled only after the component is in codeEXECUTINGcode state and the first buffer with codeOMXBUFFERFLAGCODECONFIGcode has been decoded. Until this state is reached, should the decoder populate only max. codeprofilecode and codelevelcode fields and set other fields to zeropli lipIs there a practical scenario where this index is queried from an codeOMX video decodercode A a hrefhttpandroidxref.com4.4r1searchqOMXIndexParamVideoAvcampdefsamprefsamppathamphistampprojectabiampprojectartampprojectbionicampprojectbootableampprojectbuildampprojectctsampprojectdalvikampprojectdevelopersampprojectdevelopmentampprojectdeviceampprojectdocsampprojectexternalampprojectframeworksampprojecthardwareampprojectlibcoreampprojectlibnativehelperampprojectndkampprojectpackagesampprojectpdkampprojectprebuiltsampprojectsdkampprojectsystemampprojecttools relnofollowquick searcha on codeandroidcode shows a predominant support for this index from codeencoderscode. Even in codeAOSPcode sources, the support for this index from codeExynoscode implementations is for codeprofilecode and codelevelcode. Hence, I am not particularly convinced of the intended use of this index for codeOMX video decoderscode.pli ol  pstrongCommon Implementationsstrongp  pWhen I tried to search for common implementations, I found some interesting data. TI and Broadcomm encoders support this index in some cases partially as shown in a hrefhttpprocessors.wiki.ti.comindex.phpOMXVENC relnofollowcodeOMXVENCcodea and a hrefhttphome.nouwen.nameRaspberryPidocumentationilcomponentsvideoencode.html relnofollowcodeomx.broadcomm.videoencodecodea.

Negative 6409 pI did a Mercurial  git conversion using the fastupdate utility.  Everything went fine with the conversion.

Negative 6409 pAs I understand the depth buffer, it calculates a fragments relation to the farnear clipping planes, and deduces the depth value from that before writing it.  However, this isnt what I want as I dont utilize the clipping planes, or the 3rd dimension at all.  However, depth testing would still be immensely helpful to me.p  pstrongMy questionstrong, is there any way to specify what value gets written to the depth buffer manually, for all geometry rendered after you set it that passes the Alpha Test regardless of its true depth in a scene  The Stencil buffer works this way, with the value specified as the second argument of glStencilFunc, so I thought glDepthFunc might have behaved similarly but I was mistaken.p  pThe main reason I need depth testing in a 2D game, is because my lighting model uses stencils a great deal.  Objects closer to the camera than the light must be rendered first, for shadow stencils to be properly laid out, with the lights drawn after that.  Its a pretty tricky draw order, but basically it just means lights have to be drawn after the scene is finished drawing, is all.  p  pThe OpenGL version Im using is 2.0, though Im trying to avoid using a fragment shader if possible.p

Negative 6409 pIm making a program that generates random simple melodies, based an a randomized basic chord progression from the C Major scale.p  pWhat would be a good way to generate a chord progression of 4 triads from this scale Generating 4 completely random triads from the 7 existing ones from the scale usually doesnt sound very good.p  pI need an approach to generate a chord progression that will sound good or okay, but I dont want to simply choose a progression randomly from an existing pool of progressions. I still want the program to generate these 4 triads by itself, using some simple algorithm to ensure that the generated progression sounds decent.p  pAs I said, these 4 triads will each be taken from the 7 triads of the C Major scale.p  pemPlease note This question is not a duplicate of my previous question about an approach for creating an algorithm for melody creation. This one is about finding a way to generate a chord progression. Generating melodies is a different topic.emp  pThanks for your helpp  pEDIT General guide lines on how to know if a triad will sound okay next to another triad, will also be great.p

Negative 6409 pIm working on a pos system based on sqlite. One table contains all ordersbuys. Every night the system should copy all orders to an different table in a different database, because otherwise the orders table will become too heavy monthly about 15000 new rows and the whole system will become too slow. p  pMy problem is, that when i copy the daily orders into the backup database, im loosing my last autoincrement value. That means sqlite is starting again with 1. But i need a unique ID for the orders over 2 databasestablesp  pDoes somebody has an idea, how i can force sqlite to not reset the last autoincrement value, when deleting all rowsp

Negative 6409 pI would like to know if a RegEX engine, before to try to match a regex, checks if the data has a emminimum lengthem that the regexp requires. For example the regex a1000 in a data composed of 999 a, fails. The result can be obtained avoiding to apply the regex, and only performing some checks to the length of the data and the minimum of the regex. So, generically, a RegEX engine performs this kind of tests In particular Im interested to know if the emreem module of Python does this.p

Negative 6409 pIm currently involved in a project concerning vision on the CARMA Board. The CARMA Board is composed by an ARM Tegra 3 CPU  Nvidia Quadro 1000M GPU.p  pI was successful in compiling and running the OpenCV with CUDA Support for this platform, following the instructions at  a hrefhttpcode.opencv.orgprojectsopencvwikiCARMAplatformcompilationandtesting relnofollowhttpcode.opencv.orgprojectsopencvwikiCARMAplatformcompilationandtestinga.p  pSo, Ive written a small program to analyze the difference between the CPU and GPU performances.

Ive tried to see how much time it takes elaborating on the gpu a vector of float of 600000 elements.

Negative 6409 pI have a Windows Store App. Im looking to add a Drop Shadow effect. Ive considered using a Gradiented border, but I cant seem to get it to look right. Ive tried setting the Borders codeBorderBrushcode to a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comlibrarywindowsappsbr210108 relnofollowcodeLinearGradientBrushcodea, going from the background color to black, but it seems... out of place, is the best way to put it. Is there a better way to be doing this Is there a better codeGradientcode I should be using Nonlinearp  pI think based on some suggestions that people had using CSS that going to a dark grey instead of black is the better option, so I will be toying around with that in the meantime.p  pWhat constitutes the standard CSS Drop Shadow Are there specific alpha levels that it goes up to Is it a linear gradientp

Negative 6409 pIve used the builtin codeRegularExpressionscode unit from Delphi XE2 for some time until I figured out that its object files code.objcode depend on codemsvcrt.dllcode, wrapped by codeSystem.Win.Crtlcode.

Negative 6409 pSay Ive created object codeAcode from a class codeAcode. Object codeAcode takes quite of lot of arguments to its constructor. p  pIn object codeBcode from class codeBcode I want to store an instance of codeAcode. However class codeBcode also wants quite a lot of arguments in its constructor. Instead of passing all the arguments for codeAcode to the constructor Im reasoning that its better to first create an instance of codeAcode and then send a reference to it to the constructor of codeBcode, instead of creating an even bigger mess of arguments. p  pIn c it would look something like this p  precodeclass A     Aarg1, arg2,...argn   Aarg1, arg2,...argn   class B     public    Barg1, arg2,...argn, A aptr    A myA   Barg1, arg2,... argn, ampA codepre  pIs this good code practice Also I wonder how the I best assign pointers via the constructor Ive so far done something like thisp  precodemyConstructor object pointerToAnotherObjectStoredInThisObject        pointerToAnotherObjectStoredInThisObject      pointerToAnotherObjectStoredInThisObject   codepre  pIt sure works, but is it neat, good practice etc p

Negative 6409 pI have an ODataController in an Asp.Net Web Api application that allows OData queries. Im only allowing reads, not updates. Instead of exposing the data model directly, Ive created a set of DTOs. The property names on the DTOs do not necessarily match the properties on the EF model. This causes a problem when I try to use the OData query against the EF model. Ive looked at other posts on StackOverflow around this subject but none of them seemed to resolve this issue.p  pHere is what I have right nowp  precodepublic IQueryableltCustomergt GetCustomerODataQueryOptionsltCustomergt query          ODataModelBuilder builder  new ODataConventionModelBuilder         builder.EntitySetltCustomergtCustomers         builder.EntitySetltRECORDgtRecords         builder.Namespace  MyDataService.Models          var opts  new ODataQueryOptionsltRECORDgtnew ODataQueryContextbuilder.GetEdmModel, typeofRECORD, this.ActionContext.Request         var records  IQueryableltRECORDgtopts.ApplyTodb.RECORDS         return ConvertToCustomerListrecords  codepre  pThis works until I reference specific fields in a select or filter. As soon as I reference a field in my OData query I get an ODataException like  codeCould not find a property named LastName on type MyDataService.Models.RECORDcode. This is because the EF properties have a different naming convention. In this case it should be using LASTNAME.p  pIt seems like I need to parse the query and then replace the field references with the correct names. I found the ODataUriParser which seems like it could help with this but its not as clean as I was hoping. p  pCan anyone provide me some pointers in resolving this issue Is there a better approachp
Negative 6409 pI have a map that will only allow 1 marker at a time.

Negative 6409 pThe websites are public facing IIS 6 and the backend is SQL 2005. I ran a network sniffer from both the wan side and the lan side and saw SQL querys are being run from both lan and wan. Some of the SQL querys are going internal others are going out a WAN IP and routed to an internal LAN IP. Most of the SQL querys are going from LAN to LAN. There are 2 NAT rules in the firewall that translate from a WAN IP to the internal IP of the SQL server, SQL mask service 7363 to the standard SQL service 1433. The 2nd rule does the same thing but is pointed to a different WAN IP. If I disable either of these rules the websites do not work. The websites are on a different WAN IP and the NAT translation rules there translate HTTP and HTTPS. Can someone help me understand this a hrefhttpimgur.comSlOoJXA relnofollowhttpimgur.comSlOoJXAap

Negative 6409 pIn Crystal Reports XI 11 strongI am getting a ReportSDKException  by zero e.g. divide by zero  sometime beforeduring we go to preview the report in html.strong  This happening on the middle tier java on our test server.  strongIt fails for the tester, but it works for me on my local development environment running from IntelliJ.  Pointing to the test databasestrong and using the same search criteria, strongI still couldnt get it to fail for mestrong.  p  pAll other reports in that reports module application work, except for one report, using a recently modified .rpt file REPORTINQUESTION.rpt.p  pstrongThe things I did in the REPORTINQUESTION.rptstrong file was to strongdelete one database fieldstrong card id and strongintroduce another onestrong personal id number, which also required me to strongmodify the layout so everything fitstrong.  In so doing, strongemI also chose a different Page Setup I cant recall which I used nowemstrong.  Upon initially entering CR XI IDE it told me the printer setup was not valid, and that it would just use the default.   Thats why I chose a different Page Setup, as I just mentioned.p  pstrongWhat fixed the problem was to NOT change the Page Setup  Printer Layout options at all.  The tester was able to run a version of REPORTINQUESTION.rpt with no formatting introduced  only the introduction of the new database field.strongp  pI then did a final version of REPORTINQUESTION.rpt, again, NOT changing the Page Setup  but just squeezing the fields in tighter, to make it all fit, with whatever my default was.   This also worked for the Tester.p  pAll that said, Im strongtrying to understand what was the specific cause of all thisstrong.  My best guess was the Page Setup  Layout I introduced initially was somehow unknown on the serverworkstation  and that resulted in some value becoming zero, and during the calculations to preview in html position things like the field, etc that divide by zero happened.p  pAny how, hopefully this proves helpful to someone else.  strongIm still curious to know if anyone out there has experienced

Negative 6409 pIm hoping for a little help with a rather intractable problem. For starters, Ill explain the problem, because it almost seems like it may be a conceptual one, then I will post some code samples to illustrate.p  pI have developed an application using HTML and JQuery mobile, using mySQL and PHP for the backend. I am using phonegap to port it over to the phone. The first page login page loads fine on the phone, in chrome, and in DW live view.

The given path does not exist. Ive tried to locate this file with Windows Explorer, ES File Explorer and had no success. I do not have an SD card inserted.

Negative 6409 pAFAIK, there are 3 possibilities when creating a test suite in Microsoft Test Managerp  ol liStatic test suitesli liQuery based test suites  li liRequirements test suitesli ol  pSo far I have been using query based suites that allow me to organize my tests by software area. This is what I dop  pWhen we started the project, I created a test plan release x.x.x.x, some query based suites and some test cases. When we finished developing the first release and started the new one, I created another test plan release x  1.x.x.x, cloned all my suites and test cases. This allows me to do regression on features that has already been developed and delivered to users and to continue to create new tests. Also, because of that I can easily run tests on older versions because a lot of my tests are automated even when requirements have changed when a requirement changes, my test cases and automation also changes. The only thing I need to do is to open the release test plan and I am good to go. So far so good.p  pRecently I read that there is this requirement based suites. This suite allows me to create tests that are associated with a requirement. But the way I see, this only works when we have few test cases, and so far I have more than 2,000 automated tests. I will try to explain whyp  pWhen we begin to develop a new software version, I want to duplicate copy preexisting test cases so they can be reexecuted regression to make sure nothing already developed is broken. But, cloning the test plan does not work, since my requirements have changed and its virtually impossible to duplicate every single test case and add them to the requirement based suite it belongs to.p  pSo my question is how can we use requirement based suites in this scenario Has Microsoft only thought about using few tests cases in a test plan How can we handle thousands of test cases automated or not using Test Managerp  pI am using Visual Studio 2013 Premium, TFS 2013 and and Agile project and methodology kind of.p
Negative 6409 pIm trying to find a solution to my problem, which is only applicable in our test environments. Im working with systems banking depending on each system being on the same specific date. The development we do is solely within system integrations. In short Our systems generate the data, which we then adapt between our systems. Naturally, we do not hold the source  codes to the systems we have.p  pTo my specific problem I have a systemA running on JBoss JBoss423GA on Java JRE build 1.6.032b05. Ive set up a messaging broker in WebMethodsWM listening to a specific port on this system. When users trigger certain events in systemA, JMS topics are created and sent to a queue. WM then do a few validations and deliver the messages to systemB. Everything was working properly, up until recently when we noticed that systemB was expecting a timestamp field being on the same date as the system itself were in the functionality we built wont otherwise work. The problem is that systemA does not provide such a system date option, and the timestamp in the messages are real timestamps from the operating system Windows 2008 R2. So I require a fake date timestamp applied in systemA which would be on the same date as systemB.p  pThe first solution to this problem was simply to disable the NTP sync and set a fake timestamp in Windows running systemA, which would solve the date issue. But doing this, we noticed that our Windows group policies stopped working, which affected normal logins to the server. So this was not a solution we could apply.p  pI know that others have posted this specific issue, and solutions such as using java date alternatives as JodaTime etc. I dont see how I can apply mentioned changes into my systemA due to the lack of source code. Helpsuggestions would be greatfully appreciated. Right now Im blindly focused into changing the timestamp in Java in systemA. Perhaps there are better alternatives such as just applying the fake date in WM I just dont know enough about WM to do this either.p

Access token needed in Header.Authorization], 403code, I will always get this error json. And my accessToken will always be empty.

Negative 6409 pI have a very strange case where a single test that has been passing for several hundred builds has started failing, but only on the Jenkins site. It hasnt been modified since its creation.

We then compare that this mock was correctly returned.p  pI even added some logging to compare the output from running locally vs on the Jenkins server with codeSystem.out.printlntrajectory[i]     Trajectories.geticode.

Negative 6409 pHi to all Python users,p  pI am not 100 sure but it seems that there is a bug in Pythons function codecollections.Countercode which is a part in the codecollectionscode module. The function codecollections.Countercode should count occurrences of numbers in a list, in other words it should determine frequency of the numbers in a list vector. It should not matter if these numbers are floats or integers. In many occasions it does the job properly but NOT always, and here is an example when it fails to give correct answer p  precodeimport numpy as np from itertools import groupby import collections import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  data1[250, 250, 251, 251, 251, 251, 252, 252, 252, 252, 253, 253, 253, 253, 254, 254, 254, 254, 254] data2[250, 250, 251, 251, 251, 251, 252, 252, 252, 252, 253, 253, 253, 253, 254, 254, 254, 254, 254, 255, 256, 256]   Determine no. of repetitions for the sweeped wavelengths  d2collections.Counterdata1  BUG in the collections module for data2 but NOT for data1 d3d2.values  print d3 codepre  pUsing codecollections.Countercode on codedata1code list will give correct answer d3 for all occurrencesp  precode[2, 4, 4, 4, 5] codepre  pHowever, if I apply codecollections.Countercode on codedata2code I get following answer d3p  precode[2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 1] codepre  pwhich is wrong.

When I try to set background view to UIImageView that is loading stretchable image from xcassets, this image view hugs the label which is sizeToFited automatically for some reason.p  pI have set constraints on both label and background view to anchor them to topbottom of content view, but they still get small.p  pThe cells height is 50pt, the label is about 20pt so the difference is quite visible.p  pAny idea what should I do to have background view fill entire content viewp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIn following image, you can see 2 cells, one of them in selected state. The bottom cell has both background view and selected background view set. Background view black one has no vertical slicing, its simply image with 50pt height, the Selected background view the red one has slicing enabled and it hugs the label vertically.p  pWhat I want to achieve is to have slicing enabled for both background and selected background view and having it behave like the nonsliced background view on the image, that is filling entire content view of the cellp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comB6sI3.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pscreenshot of cell layout and constraints set on the imageview that is set as background view on cellp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqJJyS.png altenter image description herep
Negative 6409 pI have an application which uses MVC and KnockoutJS. In my application is a grid in a view which shows a knockout observable array bound as data to a html grid. p  pI want to navigate to another view when a user clicks on any of the row from the grid.

Negative 6409 pHere is a great SO answer which covers the creation of selfsigned CA and then signing executables with the obtained certificates a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions84847howdoicreateaselfsignedcertificateforcodesigningonwindowsHow do I create a selfsigned certificate for code signing on Windowsa.p  pI have read a lot of discussions online on how the driver signing works and the answer seems to be almost unequivocally that you cant load unsigned or selfsigned drivers without having the test mode enabled. However, the answer I linked to and especially one comment by Roger Lipscombe seems to provide a contradicting view p  blockquote   pIf you want to use this for signing drivers, you need to import the CA   certificate into the machine store. My example imports it into the   user store, which is fine for most software, for testinternal   purposes.p blockquote  pTo me, it looks like I would be able to install drivers with selfsigned certificates issued by a selfsigned CA as long as the CA cert was imported to the machine store. I wont have to make any other changes to the system disabling test mode by pressing F8 on boot menu, messing with boot configuration flags such as TESTSIGNING or NOINTEGRITYCHECKS.p  pAm I correct What are the obstacles, if any, that this method is not used more widely when people need to load drivers that have no proper digital signatures provided such as old printer drivers etc.. Instead, people rely on booting to test mode or a thirdparty software DSEO which tampers with your system files to run such drivers. p  pWhat are the drawbacks of this method The process described in the above SO question needs admin privileges but installing drivers should need them anyway. Trusting a selfsigned CA might be a security risk  but wont disabling all signature checks be even bigger security riskp

Negative 6409 pAs of late, I have been researching all sorts of fancy collision detection algorithms and quadtrees for a 2 dimensional app, and have my application at the point where I want to start implementing those collision algorithms in.

Images are inherently expressed as rectangles, and I find it too inefficient to calculate convexconcave polygons around the pixels of the image that fit a defined alpha transparency threshold then perform some other algorithm such as minkowski portal refinement or recursive circles. I choose per pixel despite its inefficiency speed wise because of the specifically rectangular constrained shape of images Knowing this, I decrease per pixel checks by wrapping the check with a AABB collision check.

Negative 6409 pSomething that is bothering me is why the term literal is used to refer to instances of classes like codeNSStringcode and codeNSArraycode. I had only seen the term used in reference to codeNSStringcode and being naive I thought it had something to do with it literally being a string, that is between quotation markers. Sorry if that sounds pathetic, but that was how I had been thinking about it.p  pThen today I learned that certain instances of codeNSArraycode can also be referred to as literal instances, i.e. an instance of the class created using a literal syntax.p
Negative 6409 pI have a WPF application where a dataintensive operation is called by a context menu selection.  Im using Dispatcher to run the dataheavy operation in the background, but the context menu does not fully close before it begins  it starts to close i.e. fade but doesnt disappear completely before the operation begins  the result of which is a sloppy looking halffaded context menu sitting open on the screen while my executing message displays and the data operation completes.  I understand that there is a separate rendering thread that runs in the background of a WPF application, and it seems to me like the Close operation of the context menu is completing but the rendering event of fading the context menu away is not finishing before the dataintensive operation begins.

Negative 6409 pTheres this game, where if you find and modify the save file, you can change your starting weapon. Since its permadeath and the starting weapon is hardcoded, the only way you get to keep your changes is by having your save file open and every time you die close the game, change the corresponding line within the save file, save it, then open up the game again. This obviously takes time, more than what is tolerable between each playthrough. So I made a batch file that overwrote the save file with a copy that had the same data except for the line of text that indicated what was your starting weapon, so all I had to do when I died was close the game and open the batch  p  pcodeXCOPY y Cmodifiedsave Coriginalsave START d CGamesNuclear ThroneNuclear Throne Update 63 nuclearthrone.execodep  pThe problem here was that it overwrote everything in the save file, which made it so any progress I made achievements, stats, enemies killed etc. was lost. The only solution to this is changing an individual segment of text within the save file, instead of overwriting it, but since Im pretty much new to this whole thing noobish I have no idea how to do so.

I was hoping for a None or Disabledtruep  pAlso can the directory path be set web.configp  pstrongUpdate Why would we want to ignore errorsstrongp  pThe short is we dont really have write permission on the servers. p  pThe long is this isnt 100 true.  Our systems is moving towards microservices, the problem with this is that decentralized logging is a tracingvisualization nightmare.  So we moved flow tracing, exceptions, and limited tracing to a centralized system.p  pProgramming Entry points aka message Handlers, web api endpoints, etc are nearly always wrapped in a try catch log throw on each handler, this covers all our programming errors. This isnt anything really that different to normal. The centralized logging location sets of all the nice red flashing real time alarms one could wish for.p  pWhich leaves only configuration type error left like missing queues, bad assembly bindings, faulty config files, or more runtime style stuff like IoC wiring outside of the handler code.  With the centralized logging and monitoring of the error quests, it is fairly easy to detect when the service is broken and if it is then we turn on logging, restart, try the faulty issue, and fix.  Guaranteed delivery will take care of everything else once it is up again D Gone are the days of 150mb log files spread across 10 different servers.p  pThe simplicity of DefaultFactory was nice, as was not needing another nuget package and associated configuration. p  pIs this the correct way forward. Many would argue no.  Could we have done it better yes we could implement the common logger interface and pass it into NServiceBus but we arnt quiet there just yet and the win isnt critical atm. p  pA side note One really really nice thing about the way we log is that in our backoffice tool we have been able to simply show the flow for each order, similar to using a correlation id in greylog. p

Negative 6409 pI have been using mysql version 5.5.41 and have run into an issue.  I change the collation of a specific column in my table from latin1swedishci to hebrewbin, and this changes the data in that column. For instance I inserted codecolecode in the field, and on conversion, I got codecolecode.  So I searched for a solution and found a hrefhttpsdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1encharsetconversion.html relnofollowthisa. You can see it states that to not loose data on changing charsets and collations, you must convert to blob and then to the required charset. I tried that too, only to get codecolecode. So how can I change column collations without loosing data.p  pThese were my queries for the blob attempt  p  precodeALTER TABLE something CHANGE name name BLOB ALTER TABLE something CHANGE name name VARCHAR12 CHARACTER SET hebrew COLLATE hebrewbin NOT NULL codepre

Negative 6409 pIm attempting to design a layout that will accommodate all screen sizes from 3.5 inch through iPad. Currently, I have a view controller that contains a UITableView and a custom cell with some user interface objects. Im able to get the layout to show up fine with all of the constraints applied properly for screen sizes of 5.5 inches and above. However, on any screen sizes smaller than 5.5 inches, all of the user interface objects appear truncated because theyre show up too far to the right rather than in the center where theyre supposed to be. p  pWhen I check the constraints that anchor to the right side of the screen trailing constraints, I notice they extend far beyond what the screen allows and this appears to be the cause of the objects getting truncated on the right hand side of the screen. These trailing constraints are attaching to the edge of the UITableView which is currently has a width of 600 which is too much for the smaller screens to display. p  pIve tried changing the class size to compact width, any height then reducing the size of the UITableView so it can fit on the smaller screens, but this causes the UITableView to be too small on larger screens 5.5 inch an above and it leaves dead space on the right side of the screen. I used the assistant editor preview to verify this. I was surprised to see this behavior because I thought by selecting compact width it would create a separate size class that would not affect the larger screen sizes.p  pIs there any way I can make my layout fit all screen sizes with the correct proportions and so that it looks professional p

Negative 6409 pGood day, p  pParallel execution can be achieved through multiple ways. From strictly manual multithreading to using various helpers created by Microsoft. One of those helpers is the Parallel class. p  pOne of my colleagues is insisting that strongParallel.ForEachstrong or Parallel class overall is old and shouldnt be used.

In other words you should use codeTask.WhenAllcode instead of codeParallel.ForEachcode . p  pWhen asked why not use codeParallel.ForEach,code when this is exactly what was needed  strongmultiple expensive operations executed in parallelstrong, he replied that codeParallel.ForEachcode is old and that Microsoft recommends using asyncawait wherever possible. p  pI searched all over MSDN and Stackoverflow and everywhere I could but I couldnt find anything pointing at the necessity of using asyncawait instead of .Parallel. While you often can achieve similar results by interchanging these  tools it doesnt mean that strongParallel.ForEachstrong is obsolete.

Negative 6409 pI am working on an Image Processing toolbox, that links OpenCV to Scilab, so that OpenCV functions can be used in Scilab directly. Now, my issue is that I have many functions that are used in all the other codes, so i decided to include those in an external cpp file, and include that in my other codes. What I did was, i made a header file common.h with the function definitions. common.c has the actual functions written. And all my other files, for e.g opencvimcrop have a include common.h along with the other included header files. However, when i compile this in Scilab using my builder gateway filea .sce file that compiles my opencvimcrop.cpp, it gives the following errorp  pemopencvimcrop.cpp1422 fatal error common.h No such file or directory compilation terminated.emp  pThis is my common.h filep  precodeinclude common.cpp  string type2strint type int noofchannelsint type int retrieveImageMat ampimage int returnImagechar checker,int amptemp,Mat img codepre  pThis is my common.cpp filep  precodestring type2strint type       string r     uchar depth  type amp CVMATDEPTHMASK     switch  depth               case CV8U  r  8U break         case CV8S  r  8S break         case CV16U r  16U break         case CV16S r  16S break         case CV32S r  32S break         case CV32F r  32F break         case CV64F r  64F break         default     r  User break          return r   int noofchannelsint type      uchar chans  1  type gtgt CVCNSHIFT     return chans  Note  the other 2 functions are also present here, but they  comprise of 800 lines of code, so i did not paste them here codepre  pMy opencvimcrop.cppThe file that has to include the above made header file to use the functions file isp  precodeinclude ltnumericgt include opencv2corecore.hpp include opencv2highguihighgui.hpp include opencv2opencv.hpp include ltiostreamgt using namespace cv using namespace std extern C    include apiscilab.h   include Scierror.h   include BOOL.h   include ltlocalization.hgt   include common.h    int opencvimcropchar fname, unsigned long fnamelen         SciErr sciErr     int iRows0,iCols0     int piAddr  NULL     int piAddrNew  NULL     int piAddr2   NULL     int piAddr3   NULL     int piAddr4   NULL     int piAddr5   NULL     unsigned char pstDataR  NULL     unsigned char pstDataG  NULL     unsigned char pstDataB  NULL     int i,j,k     double x,y,width,height      checking input argument     CheckInputArgumentpvApiCtx, 5, 5     CheckOutputArgumentpvApiCtx, 1, 1       Mat image     retrieveImageimage      for value of topleft xcoordinate     sciErr  getVarAddressFromPositionpvApiCtx,2,amppiAddr2     if sciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0          sciErr  getMatrixOfDoublepvApiCtx, piAddr2, ampiRows, ampiCols ,ampx     ifsciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0              for value topleft ycoordinate     sciErr  getVarAddressFromPositionpvApiCtx,3,amppiAddr3     if sciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0          sciErr  getMatrixOfDoublepvApiCtx, piAddr3, ampiRows, ampiCols ,ampy     ifsciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0           for value of width     sciErr  getVarAddressFromPositionpvApiCtx,4,amppiAddr4     if sciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0          sciErr  getMatrixOfDoublepvApiCtx, piAddr4, ampiRows, ampiCols ,ampwidth     ifsciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0              for value of height     sciErr  getVarAddressFromPositionpvApiCtx,5,amppiAddr5     if sciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0          sciErr  getMatrixOfDoublepvApiCtx, piAddr5, ampiRows, ampiCols ,ampheight     ifsciErr.iErr              printErrorampsciErr, 0         return 0              defining a temporary rectangle, that denotes the area that has to be cropped into the new image     Rect myROIx[0], y[0], width[0], height[0]       Crop the full image to that image contained by the rectangle myROI      Note that this doesnt copy the data     Mat croppedRefimage, myROI      Mat cropped      Copy the data into new matrix     croppedRef.copyTocropped      int temp  nbInputArgumentpvApiCtx  1     string tempstring  type2strcropped.type     char checker     checker  char malloctempstring.size  1     memcpychecker, tempstring.cstr, tempstring.size  1     returnImagechecker,temp,cropped      Assigning the list as the Output Variable     AssignOutputVariablepvApiCtx, 1  nbInputArgumentpvApiCtx  1     Returning the Output Variables as arguments to the Scilab environment     ReturnArgumentspvApiCtx     return 0         codepre  pAnd finally, the .scebuildergatewaycpp.sce file i execute in scilab to compile the above cpp file is as followsp  precodefunction buildergwcpp     WITHOUTAUTOPUTLHSVAR  t tbxbuildgatewayskeletoncpp69690, ..

Negative 6409 pI am working on a project where I have a table view which contains a number of cells with pretty complex content. It will be between usually not more than two, but in exceptions up to  lets say  30 of them. Each of these complex cells contain a line chart. I am using ioscharts a hrefhttpsgithub.comdanielgindiioscharts relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdanielgindiioschartsa for this.p  pThis is what the View Controllers content looks like img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeG0zT.png altview controller contentp  pThe code I use for dequeuing the cells in the viewControllers cellForRowAtIndexPath method is kind of the followingp  precodevar cell  tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierPerfgraphCell, forIndexPath indexPath as UITableViewCell if cell  nil      let nibArray  NSBundle.mainBundle.loadNibNamedPerfgraphCell, owner self, options nil     cell  nib[0] as FIBPerfgraphCell   cell.setupWithServiceserviceObject, andPerfdataDatasourceId indexPath.row  1 return cell codepre  pand in the cells code I have a method setupWithService which pulls the datasources from an already existing object serviceObject and inits the drawing of the graph, like thisp  precodefunc setupWithServiceservice ServiceObjectWithDetails, andPerfdataDatasourceId id Int       let dataSource  service.perfdataDatasources[id]     let metadata  service.perfdataMetadataForDatasourcedataSource      if metadata  nil          if let lineChartData  service.perfdataDatasourcesLineChartData[dataSource]               printlnstarting drawing for lineChartData.dataSets[0].yVals.count values              chartView.data  lineChartData                codepre  pNow the problem depending on how many values are to be drawn in the chart between 100 and 2000 the drawing seems to get pretty complex. The user notices that when he scrolls down as soon as a cell is to be dequeued that contains such a complex chart, the scrolling gets stuck for a short moment until the chart is initialized. Thats of course uglyp  pFor such a case, does it make sense to NOT dequeue the cells on demand but predefine them and hold them in an array once the data that is needed for graphing is received by the view controller and just pull the corresponding cell out of this array when its needed Or is there a way to make the initialization of the chart asynchronous, so that the cell is there immediately but the chart appears whenever its readyp  pThanks for your responsesp

Negative 6409 pI am not very experienced with dependency injection so I very much value your opinion on the following.p  pIt dependency injectionIOC was used in a web application at my company. p  pThe current programming lead at our company hates this app, as he dislikes linq, entity framework and dependency injection all which feature in the app.  He thinks that collectively they all contribute to make the app slow and fragile.p  pHe blames the IOC container most off all for the perceived poor performance and today said words to this effect Im not sure, but it the IOC container must use reflection, which is very bad.p  pHe also dislikes the use of interfaces as it makes finding the definition of a file that implements an interface more difficult in Visual Studio and uses this as another reason to bash IOC containers in general.p  pI have recently discovered the SOLID principles and the above opinions just do not site right with me so I would like to know what seasoned developers think and if there are any facts to support any of the programming leads opinions.p  pThanks for reading.p

I just couldnt reach to the solution. All my other tries were too complicated with creating a graph and finding Independent set and those also were exponential in number of rows. Can someone help me with the solution for this  p  pI tried to check out other contestants code after the contest, they seem to be solving it with DP. I am not asking for full solution. Id appreciate a little detailed hints.p  pEDITp  pIf the description is not clear, the selected rows should not have common one in same column Sorry if its still not clear. Like in the given example, first and second row cannot be selected because they have one in 3rd and 8th column. Similarly 2nd and 3rd row cannot be selected because they have common one in 1st column. There is NO COMMON ONE in 1st and 3rd rows.  p

Here he collects values and turns them from an array codedataIdcode into a commaseparated stringp  precoderetrieveworksform.onsubmit, functione      e.preventDefault     togglesearchterms.triggerclick     var dataId  new Array     li.nw.eachfunction          var thisDataId  this.attrdataid         dataId.pushthisDataId          li.addedgalleryitem.eachfunction          var thisDataId  this.attrdataid         dataId.pushthisDataId          returnedgalleryworkids.valdataId.join, codepre  pThe codePOST[returnedgalleryworkids]code therefore holds a commaseparated string of the values in the codedataIdcode array. I want to revise this so it simply returns the array, with each element in a sequential index. I would think that doing this would do the trickp  precodereturnedgalleryworkids.valdataId codepre  p...but it doesnt it returns a commaseparate string of values, no different than what is returned when codedataId.join,code is the argument of the code.valcode operator.p  pThere are really two questions herep  ol liWhy is the result a commaseparated string in each caseli liHow do I make it return the codedataIdcode array li ol  p[The second question is the truly necessary question, but I want to understand the mechanics of whats taking place here.]p

Negative 6409 pI want to create an app that has a list of clients with ids emails in this case, their phone number and other important information. Most of the time the clients table will be searched by using the client id their email but occasionally I want to be able to do this search using their phone number. Basically I want the app to have a text field where you can either type the email or phone number and be able to retrieve the client data.p  precodeClient  ID, PhoneNumber, Name, LastName, etc... codepre  pAfter researching on DynamoDB, I came up with the solution of having a table for the clients and having an index hash key for the ids with a lot of throughput for read and write since querying based on this attribute will be the most common task. Then, I created a global secondary index, with a key for the attribute phoneNumber, and giving this a low throughput number for reading and writing since the search of a client by its phone number wont be too occasional. However, The app will never make an update using the phone number as a key, it will only make updates using the id as a key.p  pIs this the right approach, or would there be a better thing to do Are the throughput values right based on my needs or do you think that there is no need to have any write throughput values for the secondary index Is there maybe something wrong with thought processp  pThank you very muchp  pUPDATE Lets say the clients table has a throughput read of 10 and a throughput write of 10 on the primary index. This means that I can read about 10 data packages of 4KB each per second by executing a GetItem operation where I have provide the primary key only. And I can write 10 data packages of 1KB each per second by executing something like PutItem or update where I provide the primary key as the only way of looking up the item to be updated. Is that rightp  pNow, for the GSI, if I put lets say a read throughput of 4 and a write throughput of 4 on the global secondary index, would that mean that I can read a maximum without throttling of 4 packages of 4KB each per second by executing a GetItem operation where I only provide the secondary key as lookup method. And since I am not interested in writing down or updating any data based on the secondary key, because my app will only run update queries or putitems using its primary key, then I would be able to put a write throughput of 0 for the GSIp  por are these GSI writes affected by the changes on the primary key operations as well I know that for sure the phone number attribute will emalmostem never change after the item is created unless if I change it myself using the dynamodb manager or this will rarely happen so I could even make the write throughput 1.p

I have used redirect function to redirect the user to login page.p  pThen I get this error a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comI8i1g.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI8i1g.png altenter image description hereap  pmy code is  controllerp  precodepublic function addreviewpotsid      formdata  thisgtinputgtpost     thisgtloadgtmodelblogmodel     ifissetformdata[comment]               state  thisgtisBadformdata[comment]          else              state  thisgtisBad           thisgtdata[blogcommentback]  1     ifissetSESSION[Username]              ifstrcmpstate, 10                       ifstrcmpsubstrpotsid,0,3, Art0                              status  thisgtblogmodelgtaddreviewpotsid, formdata,SESSION[Username]                                       else                      msg  Your comment has inappropriate word.

Negative 6409 pIm trying to run the same simulation with different parameters a lot of times on a cluster. Doing that I want to run one simulation on one core. I have 24 cores available, and need to run about 70 simulations.  The parameters are specified by the path, top layer folder and second layer and in each leaf there is a specific run script which takes these parameters and run the simulation.p  pThe script I need help with, should therefore just find all leaves and then run each script located there. This should be done such that I at almost all time have 23 leaf scripts running on each available core.p  pI have already made my own, which can be seen herep  precodejump to working directory if [ z SLURMSUBMITDIR ] then     echo Running from cmd in PWD else      cd SLURMSUBMITDIR     echo Nodes SLURMNODELIST     echo Running from queue in PWD fi  find  mindepth 2  name run.sh  xargs n 1 P 24 bash codepre  phowever piping to xargs, correctly start the first 23 simulations, but once they finish, it does not start a new one.
