In the first call to codePrintTwoValuescode Im guessing that the return value from codeSomeClass.MyValuecode gets pushed onto the stack.  Then execution continues into codeGetValuecode which just starts the Task and exits.  Then codeDoWorkcode exits and schedules a continuation that will call codePrintTwoValuescode but when that continuation runs the value that had originally gotten pushed on the stack is somehow lost and reverted back to its default value.p  pWhile there are simple ways to workaround this problem, like storing the arguments in temporary variables before passing them to the codePrintTwoValuescode method, Im mostly just curious why this behavior is occurring.p  pNote  Im using Visual Studio 2013, Update 5.  Im building a console application that is targeting .NET Framework 4.5 and running on Windows 10 Enterprise.p

Also what will be an issue is creating empty lists and appending to those lists from from an args. Would it be better to create a order dict to append to, then brake that into lists at the end somehow On returning values for use later down the track I was thinking of making them globals Any suggestions Thanksp

Positive 360 pI am working on an application where I send a post request to my rails server with parameters stored in JSON format. Lets say my application routes the request to the create function on my catscontroller. The cat model has three fields name, hunger, mood. Now each cat hasmany kittens. My Kitten model has two fields catid referring to which cat owns it, because my kitten belongsto a cat and cute. Now every time i create a cat on my application I want to do it with a single call, so I call cats.json from my app with a POST request. The parameters are stored in JSON format and they include the following fields name,hunger, mood,cute. Now the controller takes these params creates a new cat, and then creates a new kitten assigned to this cat using cat.kittens.build. The kitten then just needs to use the last parameter I sent mood to get created properly. p  pNow the question is this, when I print the params variable from this controller I get the following hash name, hunger, mood, cute, catname, hunger, mood. Why does this happen  How does Rails parse the POST request params and take me from p  pname,hunger, mood,cute  to  name, hunger, mood, cute, strongcatstrongname, hunger, moodp  pHow is this strongcatstrong hash generated, when, and what rules does it followp  pThen my followup question would be, since rails 4 forces you to whitelist parameters before you use them. I am doingp  pparams.requirecat.permitname,hunger,moodp  pHow do I also permit the cute valuep

This is tricky, and potentially error prone because of the sheer number of format operations to be changed  but if the checking function is itself sound, works well.li liEstablish the direct path to PQRHOME and validate it for security details below, refusing to start if it is not secure, and thereafter using the direct path and not the value of PQRHOME when they differ.  This requires all file operations that use PQRHOME to use not the value from getenv but the mapped path.  For example, this would require the software to establish that homeattackerpqr is a symlink to optpqr, that the path to optpqr is secure, and thereafter, whenever a file is referenced as PQRHOMEsomething, the name used would be optpqrsomething and not homeattackerpqrsomething.

It requires local shell access, fortunately it is not a remote attack.  It requires a nonnegligible amount of knowledge to get there, but I consider it unwise to assume that the expertise is not out there.p  pSo, what Im describing is a format string vulnerability and the known attack path involves faking the program out so that although it thinks it is accessing secure message files, it actually goes and uses the message files which contain format strings that are under the control of the user, not under the control of the software.p
Negative 360 pNow that codesharedptrcode is in tr1, what do you think should happen to the use of codestdautoptrcode They both have different use cases, but all use cases of codeautoptrcode can be solved with codesharedptrcode, too. Will you abandon codeautoptrcode or continue to use it in cases where you want to express explicitly that only one class has ownership at any given pointp  pMy take is that using codeautoptrcode can add clarity to code, precisely by adding nuance and an indication of the design of the code, but on the other hand, it add yet another subtle issue when training new programmers they need to understand smart pointers and the fine details of how they work. When you use only one smart pointer everywhere, you can just lay down a rule wrap all pointers in codesharedptrcode and be done with it.p  pWhats your take on thisp

Negative 360 pIm trying to create an iPhone application that is always in landscape mode, using the Utility application template.

Stretch it all the way across the view, set the alignment to centered, and set the autosizing springs so that it can stretch horizontally.li liIn Info.plist, add the key UIInterfaceOrientation with value UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRightli liIn the controller classes, change the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation methods to return interfaceOrientation  UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight  interfaceOrientation  UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeftli liRun the app. li ul  pWhen I launch my app, it comes up in landscape orientation, but the main view only covers the top half of the display, and it is stretched horizontally.  I get the same results in both the simulator and on an actual device.  Ive seen it with versions 2.2 and 2.2.1 of the SDK.p  pI have been able to work around the problem by adding the following step to the abovep  ul liAdd self.view.autoresizesSubviews  NO to RootViewControllers viewDidLoad method after [super viewDidLoad].li ul  pIf I do this, then it works as expected. But this feels like a hack. Why should this be necessaryp  pI dont think it is a transformation issue.  All elements are drawn in the proper orientation and with the proper scaling.  The problem seems to be that the bounds rectangles of the main view gets funky.  It looks like the height of the main view is being cut by a little more than half, and the width is being increased by about 50.p  pIf I do the exact same set of steps using the Viewbased Application template instead of Utility, then everything works as expected.  So Im pretty sure the problem is specific to how a Utility application manages its views.p  pAnybody understand whats going on herep

Negative 360 pI have several SQL Server 2005 databases ranging from 20  600 tables in an application and no documentation.

In a well designed database, perhaps there will be multiple schemas that group tables related to one functionality  together. But as all these tables are in one schema, and I want a tool that is smart enough to perhaps suggest which tables should go together under one schema. It wont be perfect but perhaps it is intelligent enough to examine which tables should go together for example based on relationships between them or based on which tables seem to be accessed together in the stored procs.p  pThe bottom line is that I want to understand the datamodel as quickly as possible.

Negative 360 pThere are a few apps on the market that are set up to have a free main componentwhich is a trial limited to 7 days lets say then recharge apps that will add a certain amount of subscription time to an account for the user that allows them to keep using the main app. These recharge apps are available in the market as well. What I would like to know is how to make it so that once the user has paid for one of these recharge apps and used it to add time to their subscription, they are unable to uninstall it and redownload itfor free since they paid for it once. Basically how do I set my application up so that you only get 1 successful download of the app from the market per payment. Once the time has been added to the users account I would like the market to behave as though the recharge app has never been purchased.p

Negative 360 pIve written a large social networking iPhone application, and one of the biggest issues I run into is the fact that NSInteger and all the other NSnonobject types are not first class citizens.  This problem stems from the fact that, obviously, they have no representation for a nil value.p  pThis creates two main problemsp  ol liTons of overhead and opaqueness to convert to and from NSNumber when storingretrieving from a collection.li liCant represent nil.  Oftentimes, I want to be able to represent an unset value.li ol  pOne way to solve this is to use NSNumber all the time, but that gets extremely confusing.  In a User model object, I would have about 20 different NSNumbers, and no easy way to tell if each one is a float, integer, bool, etc.p  pSo here are my thoughts for potential solutions and the proscons.  Im not really sold on any of them, so I thought Id ask for feedback andor alternative solutions to this problem.p  ol listrongContinue to use NSInteger types, and just use NSIntegerMax to represent nil.strongbr PRO  Less memory overheadbr PRO  Clear typingbr CON  NSIntegerMax is not really nil.  If programmers arent careful or dont know this convention, invalid values could leak into the display layer.br CON  Cant store them in a collection without conversions in and outbrbrli listrongUse NSNumber and designate types using hungarian notation eg NSNumber fHeight, NSNumber iAgestrongbr PRO  Firstclass citizensbr PRO  Nil problem solvedbr CON  Increased memory overheadbr CON  Lose compiler type checkingbr CON  Hungarian notation is contentiousbrbrli listrongWrite my own firstclass primitive object types think Java a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferencejavalangInteger.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferencejavalangInteger.htmlastrongbr PRO  Firstclass citizensbr PRO  Nil problem solvedbr PRO  Keeps compiler type checkingbr PRO  Objects will be simpler than NSNumber.

It currently includes object wrappers for some of the more common native data types BOOL, CGFloat, NSInteger, NSUInteger.  We chose to do this because it upgrades these data types to first class citizens with strict typing.  Maybe you disagree with this approach, but it has worked well for us, so feel free to use it if you want.p  pIm adding other classes weve found uses for, including a diskbacked LRU cache, a Pair object, a low memory release pool, etc.p  pEnjoy a hrefhttpsgithub.comZooskZSFoundation relnofollowgithub  ZooskZSFoundationap

Negative 360 pI have a project that was building fine in VS 2008, and then we installed and started using TFS Build, and then we upgraded to TFS 2010.  Everything was still fine and building correctly after I implemented our new build process that made everything very nice with a singleclick build initiation from any remote Visual Studio 2010 client.  Visual Studio did not need to be installed on the Build Agent.  Im trying very hard emveryem hard not to install Visual Studio on the Build Agent because my understanding is that its not necessary, and were not licensed to install it on a nondevelopment machine.p  pNow I tried upgrading the solution to VS 2010, still targeting .NET 3.5 because its an assembly targeted for SQL Server CLR procedures, and SQL Server doesnt support .NET 4.0 yet.  But I simply cannot make it build any more under TFS Build.  I cant seem to get a consistent error message from TFS Build and from an MS Build command line, but I think it has something to do with Microsoft.Cpp.Targets not being in CProgram FilesMSBuild because I havent installed Visual Studio.  I did install the Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1 so that I could run the .NET 4.0 SDK tools like svcutil for some other .NET 4.0 projects, but nothing seems to install what this build wants.  The error TFS build gives me isp  blockquote   pCTFSBld[...]GenerateLanguageGenerateLanguage.vcxproj46,3   error MSB4019 The imported project   CMicrosoft.Cpp.Default.props was   not found. Confirm that the path in   the  declaration is correct,   and that the file exists on disk.p blockquote  pAnd when I click on that error it takes me to this line in the vcxproj filep  precode  ltImport ProjectVCTargetsPathMicrosoft.Cpp.Default.props gt codepre  pAll I really need to do in this project is run resgen to generate resources files from resx files, and compile them into sattelite assemblies.  I was using a makefile build to do this, manually running resgen I think it was because I cant find a way to compile sattelite assemblies as a standalone solution any other way, and then compile those into a DLL I cant remember how that worked now, but I think it was manually running AL.exe to compile DLL files from resources files.  So basically I just need to run command lines to build this project, and I cant seem to find a reasonable way to do it without throwing out the entire project and editing the TFS build script to run a bunch of hardcoded command lines instead.  Theres got to be a better way.p  pIve been at this all day, and tried writing my own .targets file and .xml property sheets to take the place of the standard file, but its way over my head.  I tried simply deleting the  lines, but then MSBuild complains that theres no Build target.  I tried adding a dummy  to the vcxproj file, but then it didnt seem to run the pre and postbuild steps where all the work is done.p

Negative 360 pIm porting a fairly simple iPhone Navigation based app to a Split View iPad app.br I have two nested levels of navigation on the Master view.  The user picks a value from the first table and it loads the 2nd table.  Selecting a value on the second table loads the Detail item for the detail view.  Or its supposed to.  The didSelectRowAtIndexPath on my 2nd controller is firing but indexPath is null.  p  pIm following the SplitView template fairly closely.  Im only really getting off the beaten track by adding that 2nd TableViewController.  My RootViewController loads the 2nd TableViewController on didSelectRowAtIndexPath, and that parts working.  In my 2nd TableViewController.m Im trying to set the detail item for the DetailView. But its that didSelectRowAtIndexPath method thats not giving me the row.  Im fairly new to this, but it seems odd to me that the method for clicking a row would fire but not have the index for that row. p  pHeres the codep  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       TrackerSplitViewAppDelegate appDelegate  TrackerSplitViewAppDelegate [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]     detailViewController.thisRequest  [appDelegate.requests objectAtIndexindexPath.row]     NSLogRequest Loaded , detailViewController.thisRequest.Title     NSLogIndex Row , indexPath.row     [appDelegate release]   codepre  pThe array of requests is loading properly appDelegate.requests but my objectAtIndex is failing because indexPath is null.  Or at least indexPath.row is null.  p  pEDIT  Ok, the comments below are correct, Im not using NSLog properly.  The indexPath.row is fine I thought it was also showing up as null using the mouseover in the debugger, but I just dont know how to use the debugger properly.p  pThe detailViewController property isnt getting set right for some reason.  If I substitute with thisp  precodedetailViewController.thisRequest  [appDelegate.requests objectAtIndexindexPath.row] Request aRequest  [appDelegate.requests objectAtIndexindexPath.row] codepre  pThe aRequest object loads just fine.  So the next question is why setting my property on my detailViewController object isnt working. Im still quite fuzzy on how things persist in this environment.  Any additional input would be great.  p

Negative 360 pI have a project with an Article scaffold  which includes a paperclip file field for the thumbnail  and others on the team are complaining about how they have to add the file to the field again when they submit the form and a validation error is triggered due to missing data on another field.p  pFiguring that was due to browser limitations, I added a remote  true to the form, along with an error.js.erb file, figuring the file field would persist if the page didnt have to be reloaded. Unfortunately that wasnt the case, as I read that browsers are unable to process multipart forms  files through AJAX for security reasons. However, I then discovered the a hrefhttpsgithub.comJangoSteveremotipart relnofollowRemotipart gema which solves this issue. So the relevant parts of my application looks like the following...p  pstrongform.html.erbstrongp  precodelt formforarticle, html gt  multipart gt true , remote gt TRUE do f gt   ltdiv iderrorsgtltdivgt   lt f.textfield title gt   lt f.textarea body gt   lt f.filefieldphoto gt   lt f.submit gt lt end gt codepre  pstrongarticlescontroller.rbstrong Create actionp  precode  def create     article  Article.newparams[article]      respondto do format       if article.save         format.html  redirecttoarticle, notice gt Article was successfully created.          format.xml   render xml gt article, status gt created, location gt article        else         format.html  render action gt new          format.xml   render xml gt article.errors, status gt unprocessableentity          format.js  render errors, locals gt  item gt article         end     end   end codepre  pstrongerrors.js.erbstrongp  precodelt remotipartresponse do gt     errors.empty.appendltdiv iderrorexplanationgtlth2gtlt pluralizeitem.errors.count, error gt prohibited this article from being savedlth2gtltulgtltulgtltdivgt     lt item.errors.fullmessages.each do msg gt         errorexplanation ul.appendltligtlt escapejavascriptmsg gtltligt     lt end gt lt end gt codepre  pSo basically, if there are validation errors, the js file adds those errors to the errors div on the form.

Negative 360 pI know there are many ways to accomplish what I am trying to do here, but I wanted to try it with LINQ, and am seeing some odd to me results.

The question is, do their reference counters decrement accordingly when the Button1 object that created them is removed from the display list and nulled out I tested this code and the event listener in the Test class does seem to shut off, but that doesnt necessarily mean that it or the Button2 instance are eligible for GC. Even if they were, it might only be under Mark and Sweep, which is slower than reference countbased GC.p  pOne obvious solution would be to have the Button1 class remove listeners fromnull out references it makes when it is time for it to be removed like sop  precodepackage com.gui       import fl.controls.Button      import flash.display.          public class Button1 extends Sprite            private var button2HandleButton2           private var testerTest           public function Button1                  constructor code                button2Handle  new Button2                tester  new Test                              public function destroyRefs                      button2Handle  null                      tester.removeEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, tester.yellLoudly                      tester  null                           codepre  pbut in a real program, where I may be working with multiple references to the same object from different classes via passing in the original references in constructors wouldnt setting the reference in one class to null cause the value of all other references to the same object to also become null That would certainly be undesirable... p  pstrongThe main question is as follows when the only reference to Button1 is nulled out, do all the the objects it references have their reference counters decremented either immediately or when the Button1 object is garbage collectedstrong p  pAlso, is there a way to view all instances of an object that exist in real time andor their reference count values through the Flash debugger  A detailed profiler like that would really help in figuring these questions out...p  pthanks, CCJp
Negative 360 pI have a JPanel with a set of items for example combo boxes and text fields. Some action listeners are implemented on those items to register user updates.p  pIf the user selects a value in a JComboBox for example, the action listener captures the event. The corresponding underlying bean method is called and the panel is refreshed. Changing can have an impact on other fields displayed in the pane.p  pThe problem is that when the panel is refreshed, all listeners are triggered, and they call for a refresh themselves. This leads to an infinite loop. p  pHow can I avoid this I cant get rid of the listeners, because I need to capture user updates, but I dont want these to fire when I am only refreshing the panel content.p

Negative 360 pSorry if this is a bit complicated. I will try to describe it as best I can, but please ask questions if I am unclear.p  pI am working on a Rails app that needs to have an autoupdated status page. This status page will have Requests, which have many Attempts, which have many Steps. In order to keep this page as current as reasonably possible, we are using JQuery to poll the server every 5 seconds. p  pThis then brings us to the index.js.erb file via the index action. This file is currently set up to determine based on whats on the screen which partials need to be rerendered. I use whats currently on the screen to determine if a requestattemptstep is still active to know what needs to be refreshed. I chose this, instead of using whats in the database, since the database would update an item to be inactive, causing the onscreen, active item to not be updated to show its new inactive status.... but maybe theres a better way around this.p  pNow to my main issue. In my erb file, I have plenty of p  pcodeif some statement lt escapejavascriptrender partialgtmypartial gtcodep  pwhich, evaluates all partials mentioned in the script, no matter what condition. This is going to increase our rendering time exponentially, and seems to be taking a big hit on our server.p  pIs there a way to conditionally render partials based upon whats currently on the screenp  pIs there a way better approach to this whole ordeal I know dynamically updated status pages are all over the place, but could not find a good example to lead me in the right direction.p  pAlso, heres a snippet of some of my actual code, to maybe provide a better example of what Im doing.

In reality it means that if the last visible row does not entirely fit the available space it should be moved to the next page.p  pTo give you an example lets imagine that we have a list of 10 images. Each one is 10x10 px but my screen resolution only allows me to fit a grid 35x35 px. This means that one empageem is only capable of presenting 9 images in form of a 3x3 grid as 5 px is not enough to present a full image. The 10th image should be then emtransferredem to the second page.p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pThis is obviously not happening automatically with the code that Ive pasted above as the codeTileLayoutcode allows for displaying partially visible rows in a form of a vertically scrolled list. strongI was wondering how I could achieve the behavior described above.strongp  pIf the above description does not sound logical please let me know so that I can adapt it or include more details.p  pAny help on this will be highly appreciated p

Negative 360 pBackground on my situation is this Im a longtime Windows and Linux user and in the past few years Ive moved exclusively to Windows for my userfacing computers and Ubuntu server for my servers.  Im moving into a new research position where I cannot avoid using Mac.  However, I have set up all the Git repos on my server to be readwriteable using Smart HTTP and I let Apache handle my authentication.  All of the connections are over SSL.p  pI have not yet found a freeware client on MacOS well, any GUI Git client that will handle Apaches authentication.  So, I have two solutions to my problem.  The first is the identification of a freecheap Git GUI for MacOS that can handle HTTPS and authentication over HTTP.  If you know of one, awesome, please tell me.  However, I am still interested to know the answer to scenario 2.p  pThe second is to try to use gitosis to do my authentication using keys.  If I pursue that path, I need to be able to leave the HTTP authentication alone for legacy purposes and, frankly, to ease my key management my only having to manage the keys for my own Mac machines.  Im not wellversed enough in gitosis to know if I can push commits to a repo both through gitosis and using Smart HTTP.  If anyone can shed light on whether or not this would be possible, that would be great.  An example of how to do it would be exponentially better, and a solution that also allowed commits over SSH would be the absolute cherry on top.p  pThanks so muchp

My focus is lowcollisions over performance, as the hash will not be calculated very often.p  pMy frontrunners are MD5, FNV1a, MurmurHash2, Hsieh, and DJB.p  pWhatever hash I use will have to be implemented in C and will be used on a microcontroller with a tiny processor.p  pI know that the trick to choosing a good hash function for your needs is knowing what sort of input youre going to be feeding it.p  pThe reason Im asking this question is that the idea popped into my head that both IMEI and MAC have finite lengths and ranges, so perhaps there exists a fairly simple hash function that can cover the full sets of both and not have collisions. Thus, a perfect hash functionp  pAn IMEI number is 15 decimal digits long 1213 bytes in hex, and a MAC address is 6 bytes.

In practice, Id be adding a macro, rather than the actual override identifier, to use our code on older compilers that dont support this feature.

Negative 360 pIm writing a Gaussian blur with variable radius standard deviation, i.e. each pixel of the image is convolved using a different kernel.

Negative 360 pIm part of a team looking to move from our relational data warehouse to a SSAS cube.  With our current setup we have an EmployeeCache table basically a fact which is a mapping from each of our employee ids to their viewable employee ids.  This table is joined in our model to our DimEmployee table so that for every query that needs personally identifiable information the DimEmployee records are filtered.  The filter is applied from a session variable that is the user id which is making the query.p  pAll of the examples we researched to provide dimension level security in a SSAS cube have required the use of Windows managed security.  The systems that create the data that is being analyzed handle their own security.  Our ETLs map the security structure into the aforementioned EmployeeCache and DimEmployee tables.  We would like to keep this simple structure of security.p  pAs we see it there is no way to pass in session values aside from using the query string which were not seeing it possible with Cognos 10.1 to the cube.  Were also not seeing any examples out there on security which does not require the use of Windows auth.p  pCan someone explain if there is a way to achieve dimensional security as I have previously described in a SSAS cube  If there is no way possible could another cube provider have this functionalityp

Negative 360 pSorry if this is blindingly obvious and I seem a little bit stupid here but I am very new to HTML CSS.  I have been teaching myself for a few weeks now.  I am using Microsoft Visual Web Developer 2010 Express, which has a nice layout for a beginner as I can have the style sheet and the code sidebyside.  p  pI created an original image for a page in my website and created a suitable class and ID.  So far, so good I have done that for lots of images in this website without any problems.  This one has developed some strange properties though.p  pIt is almost exactly the same as a number of other images on similar pages but has developed an attached hyperlink to another page in the site.  I didnt copypaste the image, the styles or the code from that page.  Its visible, but not editable, in the CSS properties window but not on the style sheet or in the code and it is not a property of the image itself.p  pHow did this happen and how can I get rid of it  Ive tried using a different image, rewriting the code and renaming the class and ID to no avail.   p  pHelpp

The reason nothing was happening was because my database table REQUIRED certain fields not to be null. CFWheels wasnt throwing any errors. Once I passed values to these fields it was fine so just be sure to check that one outp  pHope that helps.p

Negative 360 pIm currently implementing the Javascript Facebook login API. p  pBased on the callback response from Facebook, this client side script then sends a request with query string parameters to a URL on our site. Based on the email in that URL, the client is authenticated.p  pThis is not secure. No other token that we can verify against is returned from Facebook as far as I know, and we are expected to log the user in based on an email in a query string parameter, and no password.p  pId like to add another query string parameter that gives us some sort of assurance that the query string data came from a JavaScript redirect following the response from Facebook. p  pIm thinking that this should be some sort of hashed value created by a client script that I can compare against server side. However, every resource used to create this secret key would be available to an attacker, via client cookies or through inspecting the client script.p  pIs there a common and secure approach to this problem that I can usep

Negative 360 pI have an iphone app consisting of a tabbar controller in the main.xib, where the tab bar controller contains navigation controllers, which are associated with corresponding view controllers.  I assume this is pretty standard.p  pIf I present a modal view controllers view from a navigation controller contained in this hierarchy, the view owned by this view controller pops up as you would expect.  However, Ive noticed if I have controls such as a button at the very bottom of this modally presented view it is rarely detecting taps.  It seems as though the tabset underneath is blocking the touches.  Note that when I present the modal view controllers view it fills the visible screen, it isnt sliding up from underneath the tab set.p  pI thought this tababar controllernavigation controller hierarchy was pretty standard, shouldnt I be able to present a modal view controller from a navigation controller in this set up without issue  I have also tried to present the modal view controller from the tab bar controller, with the same effect.p  pHow do I present a modal view controller in an app with the tabbar controllernavigation controller hierarchy such that the lowest portion of that view can detect touchesp  pthanks for any helpp

Negative 360 pIm working on a project for a company that finds vendors to perform services for employee relocations.  These services are things that movers dont have the expertise to do, like preparing a piano or for transit or constructing crates for valuables.p  pIn this domain, an Order has 1many Locations.  p  pIn the moving industry, orders are frequently in flux right up until the time the vendor is to perform the services requested of him.  Therefore, in our model we have some statuses e.g. Submitted, Cancelled, On Hold that apply to Orders and Locations.p  pTheres some pretty simple business rules that apply here.  Heres a samplingp  ol liWhen an Order is placed On Hold, all Locations are placed On Hold.li liA Location cannot be taken Off Hold if its parent Order is On Hold.li ol  pAnd so on.

Negative 360 pTLDR I want to eliminate an entire joinsubselect if a parameter says so.p  pLets say I have a query in a stored procedure like thisp  precodeopen curresult for select t1. from table1 t1 join select key, value, rownumber over partition by key order by whatever rn from table2 t2 on t1.key  t2.key and t2.rn  1 where [...lots of things...] and t2.value  something codepre  pYou see, I dont just join table1 to table2, I need to join only the first records of table2 based on some criteria, hence the rownumber calculation in the subquery and rn1 additional join condition. Anyway, the point is that this is an expensive subquery, and I want to filter based on this subquery.p  pMy goal is that this subquery should be conditional, based on an additional parameter. If I want to repeat everything, heres how it looksp  precodeif shouldfiltertable2  1 then   [the above query is copied here completely] else   open curresult for   select t1. from table1 t1    no table2 join   where [...lots of things...]    no table2 condition end if codepre  pThe problem is that there can be many such parameters and so many branches of almost the same SQL which looks ugly and is hard to maintain. I could also do thisp  precodeopen curresult for select t1. from table1 t1 join select key, value, rownumber over partition by key order by whatever rn from table2 t2 on t1.key  t2.key and t2.rn  1 where [...lots of things...] and shouldfiltertable2  0 or t2.value  something codepre  pThis is easy to maintain, but if the parameter says that the subquery doesnt matter, it is still executed unconditionally. Based on my experiences, Oracle cant optimize this and this is a huge performance hit.p  pSo the question can you do this in 1 query AND with good performance Something like thisp  precodeopen curresult for select t1. from table1 t1 join case when shouldfiltertable2  1 then select key, value, rownumber over partition by key order by whatever rn from table2 else [empty table] end t2 on t1.key  t2.key and t2.rn  1 where [...lots of things...] and shouldfiltertable2  0 or t2.value  something codepre  pSo if shouldfiltertable2 is 0, the subquery shouldnt be calculated and the filter shouldnt be applied at all.p  pDynamic SQL should be avoided. I suspect how to do this in dynamic SQL, but it raises the same maintainability issue.p

Hopefully they will provide a fix or a better workaround for this soon.p

In Chrome you have to use  codeObject.getPrototypeOflocationcode, whereas FF allows codeLocation.prototypecode. p  pBasically, I have 2 questionsbrWhats the difference between the codelocation.origincode stuff above andp  precodevar foo  barfunctionreturn Foobar foo.bar.valueOf  functionreturn this console.logfoo.bar  logs Foobar codepre  pAnd secondlybr Are there any other objects that behave like thisp

Negative 360 pObviously, I know why to use a replica set in general.p  pBut, Im confused about the difference between connecting directly to the PRIMARY mongo instance and connecting to the replica set. Specifically, if I am connecting to Mongo from my node.js app using Mongoose, is there a compelling reason to use connectSet instead of connect I would assume that the failover benefits would still be present with connect, but perhaps this is where I am wrong...p  pThe reason I ask is that, in mongoose, the connectSet method seems to be less documented and  wellused. Yet, I cannot imagine a scenario where you would NOT want to connect to the set, since it is recommended to always run Mongo on a 3x replica set...p

You can correctly predict that this computing environment is safety and mission critical thus the need for my teams monitoring software. Installing software in such an environment requires privileges, consumes resources, and imposes a small but real risk to the system. Thus,  prudent but weeksconsuming checks have been implemented by the railroad to scrutinize software to be installed, including signoff by a changecontrol board. This is the route we had planned for. But if we can eliminate this risk and thereby lessen the formality by running without any installation, that could be an advantage to at least consider. However, we do not want our architecture to be restricted by the noninstall requirement, i.e., we dont want to have to write the whole program in one module. From your answers it seems my notion is not possible.p

Negative 360 pIm trying to write a Postgres trigger such that when a configuration table is updated, a backend component is notified and can handle the change. I know that Oracle has the concept of a webHTTP trigger, where you can execute an HTTP GET from the Oracle instance itself to a URL that can then handle the request at the application layer. Im wondering if Postgres codev. 9.0.5code has the same feature, or comes with anything similar and, subsequently, how to set it upconfigure itp

I load the file according to the schema like thisp  precode Load the ABC XSD var schemata  new XmlSchemaSet string abcSchema  FooResources.AbcTemplate using var reader  new StringReaderabcSchema using var schemaReader  XmlReader.Createreader      schemata.Addstring.Empty, schemaReader    Load the ABC file itself var settings  new XmlReaderSettings      CheckCharacters  true,     CloseInput  false,     ConformanceLevel  ConformanceLevel.Document,     IgnoreComments  true,     Schemas  schemata,     ValidationType  ValidationType.Schema,     ValidationFlags  XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ReportValidationWarnings   XDocument inputDoc try      using var docReader  XmlReader.CreateconfigurationFile, settings              inputDoc  XDocument.LoaddocReader       catch XmlSchemaException xsdViolation      throw new InvalidDataException.abc file format constraint violated., xsdViolation  codepre  pThis works fine in detecting trivial errors in the file. However, because the schema is locked to a namespace, a document like the following is invalid, but sneaks throughp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltbadDoc xmlnshttpFooBarBaxgt   This is not a valid document but Schema doesnt catch it   because of that xmlns in the badDoc element. ltbadDocgt codepre  pI would like to say that only the namespaces for which I have schemata should pass schema validation.p

Negative 360 pI would like to try out Spring Sources Spring Loaded class reloading agent, with Tomcat run via IntelliJ. p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comSpringSourcespringloadedhttpsgithub.comSpringSourcespringloadedap  pIve added the JVM arguments to my Tomcat run configuration, and my webapp starts up without errors and seems to behave normally. p  pIm not really sure how to trigger the class reloading though. Do I just need to compile the classes that I modify Ive tried that and that didnt seem to work. Do I need to update Tomcat and deploy classes and resources That doesnt seem to work either...p  pAny specific configuration details would be greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT More info, I think my problem may have to do with using two modules, one a core code library, and one the webapp. I use Maven for both, one configured as a jar project and the other as a war project. IntelliJ sets up the Artifact for the exploded war to use the jar modules jar file. Ive tried switching the Artifact config to incorporate the jar modules compiled output into WEBINFclasses instead. Now I see the .class files in targetwebappWEBINFclassetc. But Im not sure how to get InelliJ to update a specific class file when I edit it.p
Negative 360 pOk I have a weird one here if anyone can answer it. p  pI have an application which launches the default camera takes a picture and uploads it to a server. The upload process happens in an internal class which extends AsyncTask. Before calling the async task I have a method which shows a progress dialog which is then dismissed in the onPost Execute method of the AsyncTask.  This all works fine on my own device. The problem arises when I test it on a Samsung Galaxy S3.p  pI get a null pointer exception on the progressDialog.Show which doesnt crash the application it simply doesnt show the dialog. But I do get a crash when I try to dismiss the dialog onPostExecute. I thought it was being caused because the S3s camera seems to only open in landscape despite my whole application being locked to portrait in every way Google could tell me is possible and the orientation change was causing a refresh on the activity causing the reference to progressDialog to be lost. p  pNo amount of changing where the dialog is instantiated onPreExecute does work but I still get the same issue, checking if it was null or saving Instance state has fixed this issue. I read in another post that some people were having issues when saving to the SD card. The S3 didnt have an SD card but the app was trying to write to external storage. I tried doing a check to see if there is an sd card using.p  precodeBoolean isSDPresent  android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageState.equalsandroid.os.Environment.MEDIAMOUNTED codepre  pWhich actually returned true even without an SD card. It wasnt critical that the image get written to external storage so I tried just getting a cached copy with this.p  precodeFile image  File.createTempFile             imageFileName,              JPEGFILESUFFIX,              this.getCacheDir              codepre  pThis also made no difference. Why you ask do I care about this SD card issue it couldnt possibly be affecting the Progress Dialog. Well if I put an SD card into the S3 the problem goes away and the progress dialog appear perfectly. I have no idea why this works but I cant guarantee that people using the app will have an SD card in their devices so I need to find a proper fix.p  pSorry for the essay but I thought it needed a bit of explaining to get a clear understanding.  Any ideas or solutions would be greatly appreciated.p  pThe code below is a stripped down version of what im using I tried to include only the relevant material.p  precode Override  public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState           super.onCreatesavedInstanceState          setContentViewR.layout.comparelayoutactivity            findViewByIdR.id.bCompare.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener                        public void onClickView v          try            capturedImage  createImageFile          catch IOException e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             e.printStackTrace                   ifisNetworkAvailable             Intent i  new IntentMediaStore.ACTIONIMAGECAPTURE             i.putExtraMediaStore.EXTRAOUTPUT, Uri.fromFilecapturedImage             startActivityForResulti, REQCODEPHOTOTAKE                  else             displayAlertNetwork Error, You do not have access to the internet.

Negative 360 pI am trying to reserve 10MB out of the 2GB onboard RAM on an embedded singleboard computer that uses the Canyonlands PowerPC460EX CPU.

Negative 360 pWhen we deploy new versions of the iOS app into the App Store through XCode, an archive is generated.p  pIs there a way to take an old archive and run it in the simulator I would like to do that in order to be able to easily test backward compatibility of the serverside code with all the previous versions of the app or at least the two mostly used at that time.p  pI know that I could commit into a GIT repository and pull a specific version, but that has two problems a. it is more complex than simply running an archive, b. it is errorprone and stops development of the new version on the machine it is done, and c. there could be some bias related to the compiler changes or any other XCode change in between rendering the version hard to compile.p  pI could not find any help on that on StackOverflow, nor any sign of this possibility in the Archive repository in XCode.

Negative 360 pI am building a nonblocking chat application for my website, and I decided to implement some multiprocessing to deal with DB querying and realtime messaging.p  pI assume that when a user lands on a given URL to see their conversation with the other person, I will fire off the script, the multiprocessing will begin, the messages will be added to a queue and displayed on the page, new messages will be sent to a separate queue that interacts with the DB, etc. Regular message features ensue.p  pHowever, what happens when the user leaves this page I assume I need to exit these various processes, but currently, this does not lend itself to a clean exit. I would have to terminate processes and according to the multiprocessing docsp  precodeWarning If this method terminate is used when the associated process is using a pipe  or queue then the pipe or queue is liable to become corrupted and may become  unusable by other process.Similarly, if the process has acquired a lock or  semaphore etc. then terminating it is liable to cause other processes to  deadlock. codepre  pI have also looked into codesys.exitcode however, it doesnt fully exit the script without the use of codeterminatecode on the various processes. p  pHere is my code that is simplified for the purposes of this question.

Negative 360 pThere is an array inside the session hash which Im adding things to it. The problem is, sometimes multiple requests get processed at the same time because ajax, and the changes a request makes to the array is then replaced by the changes made by the second request.p  pExample, the array first looks like thisp  blockquote   p[63, 73, 92]p blockquote  pThen the first request adds something to itp  blockquote   p[63, 73, 92, 84]p blockquote  pThe second request does the same thing but works on the older version obviouslyp  blockquote   p[63, 73, 92, 102]p blockquote  pSo in the end the array doesnt look like it should.

Negative 360 pI want a general solution on how to avoid insanely high number of constructor arguments. The examples Im providing here are just examples, and I dont want a specific answer for the exact example here. That being said, my problem is obviously having too many arguments in my constructor.p  pI have a base class for any type of person soldiers, wizards, merchants, etc. called codePersoncode. My codePersoncode class is fairly simple, it implements the basic things common for every person there is. Lets say I have the following attributes, and my constructor takes an argument for each of these attributesp  ul licodestring firstNamecodeli licodestring surnamecodeli licodeuint healthcodeli licodeuint maxHealthcode  we dont want anyone to have 999999999 health...li licodeuint movementSpeedcode  and not everyone runs at same speed, rightli ul  pSo the constructor would look likep  precodePersonPersonconst string ampfirstNameMissing first name,                const string ampsurnameMissing surname,                const uint health100,                const uint maxHealth100,                const uint movementSpeed50      mfirstNamefirstName,     msurnamesurname,     mhealthhealth,     mmaxHealthmaxHealth,     mmovementSpeedmovementSpeed  codepre  pNow imagine a new class, deep down in the inheritance tree, called a codeWizardcode. Most wizards are there for combat, so they can also attack, etc. Wizards constructor could look like thisp  precodeWizardWizardconst string ampfirstNameMissing first name,                const string ampsurnameMissing surname,                const string ampwizardNameMissing wizard name,                const uint health100,                const uint maxHealth100,                const uint mana100,                const uint maxMana100,                const uint strength50,  physical damage                const uint witchcraft50,  spell damage                const uint armor30,  vs. physical damage                const uint resistance30,  vs. spell damage                const uint movementSpeed50      WarriorfirstName, surName, health, maxHealth, strength, armor, resistance, movementSpeed,     mwizardNamewizardName,     mmanamana,     mmaxManamaxMana,     mwitchcraftwitchcraft  codepre  pThere could be even more arguments, but I suppose you get the point. That might not even look bad, but imagine looking at a strangers code and seeing something like thisp  precodeWizard wiz  new WizardTom, Valedro, Lord Voldemort, 300, 400, 200, 200, 10, 500, 30, 400, 300 codepre  pSomeone might say that emits still not that bad, you can just read the docsem Imo. that is terrible and makes the code insanely hard to read and even write. Also the order of the arguments gets hard for one to keep track of.p  pThere are few solutions Ive thought of, but they have their downsides. One thing would be to use default constructor and give it no arguments at all, then use setters to do the jobp  precodeWizard wiz  new Wizard wizgtsetFirstNameTom wizgtsetSurnameValedro ... codepre  pOf course this would create dozens of extra lines of text, and some people are hardly against getters and setters. It would get rid of the numbers with no meanings tho, atleast you could read what each number does codewizgtsetHealth100code obviously tells were setting health here.p  pAnother solution would be to combine some attributes into structs. I could easily merge codefirstNamecode, codesurnamecode and codewizardNamecode even better, use codenicknamecode into a codeNamecode class or struct. This would reduce the number of my arguments in this example, but as I said, I want a general answer for such a problem. There could still be awfully many arguments even after combining some of them, or you might not be able to combine any cause theyre not similar at all.p

Negative 360 pIm currently developing a GUI in C for a program that must poll, process and then display data with a plot in real time.p  pThe part Im struggling with is the code, running in a separate thread, that actually polls the data from some external hardware and then process it. I want the function that does this work to be called periodically with a fixed period i.e. 120 second between calls. p  pI dont really know if its possible and how to enforce the fact that the function must be called periodically, exactly 20 times per second...p  pAfter reading a bit about realtime programming, and based on what I learned notably with game development and the concept of the main game loop, my first approach would be to use a loop which would adjust the execution time based on how much time the polling  processing tookp  precode whilerunning      Lets assume this function get the time elapsed since      the program started      int start  getcurrenttimemillisecond       Retrieve the data from the hardware      pollData       Process the data retrieved      processData       Queue the data wherever it is needed       plotting widget of the GUI       recording object      dispatchProcessedData       int elapsed  getcurrenttimemillisecond  start      int remaining  50  elapsed       ifremaining gt 0          sleepremaining         codepre  pbut this seems flawed, as it may cause a drifting problem, if the time elapsed during one iteration is greater than the period I want to stick to. p  pThis could come from the fact that the computations takes too much time I highly doubt it, but Im quite not experienced enough to be sure, and  profiling could help eliminate this problem, or at least establish that the code may take to much time, but I also wondered if the fact that I run multiple thread could lead to the same issue due to thread scheduling again, Im quite new to multithreading, I could be completely wrong.p  pTherefore, Id like to ask  p  ul listrongIs it possible to enforce such a constraint with realtime programming in a multithreading context, if relevant and how strongli listrongWhat are the main guidelines that I should follow when designing this kind of code strongli ul  pI apologize if by any chance I missed obviouseasy to find documentation on this topicp  pThanks p

Negative 360 pIm working on implementing Separating Axis Theorem collision with SFML but am running into a problem with my vertex arrays. They are being transformed the class containing the vertex array inherits sfTransformable but the vertex coordinates do not receive the transformation namely rotation thus the collision does not work if the object is not in its original orientation. I tried creating a new vertex array before calculating the SAT collision for the vertex array by using something like thisp  precode    length  sqrt shape1.getShape[i].position.xshape1.getShape[i].position.x  shape1.getShape[i].position.yshape1.getShape[i].position.y      newshape1[i].position.x  lengthcos shape1.getRotationPI180      newshape1[i].position.y  lengthsin shape1.getRotationPI180  codepre  pfor the two shapes being tested. However, this doesnt seem to be working. My function returns that a collision has occurred even though one hasnt. Im not sure if theres an error with the math, but without the SFML transformations applied to the object it works perfectly. So, is there something else I should be doing or is there another way to gather VertexArray information with transformations pretty much just rotation appliedp  pEdit I found some information here a hrefhttpsfmldev.orgdocumentation2.0classsf11Transform.phpdetails relnofollowhttpsfmldev.orgdocumentation2.0classsf11Transform.phpdetailsa But Im having some trouble understanding how this should be applied to my VertexArrays. It looks like I should be doing something with codegetTransformcode inside my class and pass some combination of that with the class VertexArray.p  pEdit Using the information above I tried using this method instead over each vertex of the VertexArray prior to SAT calculationsp  precode    newshape1[i].position  shape1.getTransform.transformPoint shape1.getShape[i].position  codepre  pAfter negating the transformation position when calculating dot products, it produces the exact same results as the first attempt.p

But is it possible to loop in this way within a codeSELECTcode statementp  pemNOTEem  In reality, both the codeCASEScode and codeUPDATEScode tables are quite wide, so I abandoned any option of widening my single codeTEMPcode table ie, to present all 112 codeSeqNocode sets of data for each codeCaseIdcode. Also, I realize that a change to the report interface code could help solve the issue  but Im trying to avoid that costly option.p  pstrongUPDATE  Workaroundstrong Well, Ive had to resort to the single wide codeTEMPcode table solution that I originally abandoned.

Negative 360 pSimple form of the question firstbr For serving large number of static content to a large number of clients, is it better to make an http server serve the content from the filesystem where each of the primary keys are stored in a file Inodes or to implement a real database With better I mean in terms of performance, machine load, memory usage and so on.p  pMore detailed version of the questionbr Were currently doing a redesign of a database server that has the following requirementsp  ul liSSLli lithousands of clients 130.000li liclient requests are serialized, one at a time, about 100 entries within 2 minli liclients will disconnect after timeoutli lisome clients will later reconnect and do some more 110 requestsli lidatabase will contain  100.000 primary keysli lidatabase content is static more or lessli lirequest size is usually lt 80 bytesli liresponse size is usually  lt 30 bytesli ul  pAlthough our protocol is currently not http I thought about using Apache or another http server and altering our protocol to fit into http. But then the next question is whether to use a real database e.g. couchdb or if we just use the filesystem as database since  95 of the requests will be request for static content. Performance and scaling is an issue here. If e.g. 1.000 clients will be powered on at exactly 0800 AM, it might happen that these 1.000 machines connect simultaneously and do their 100 requests each.

Starting from codestartcode, I see a jump to code0x400648code  an address within the codePLTcode  which contains the instruction codejmp 0x20065aripcode. This jump leads to code0x600ca8code, which is actually code0x40064ecode. This brings us back to the codePLTcode and executes codepushq 0x2code.p  pHeres where Im stuck I know the codepushq 0x2code instruction exists to tell the dynamic linker to resolve the 3rd entry in the code.dynsymcode table. The problem is that the codestvaluecode field in that entry is code0x0code. This value should actually be the offset of codemaincode from codestartcode, right If so, how does the codestvaluecode field get initializedp

Negative 360 pIm having issues converting the strings into .text for the ability of inserting data into a commandtext for insertion into my database.

Negative 360 pI have a newly completed Drupal site and somewhere along the line I picked up a bug where the time to first byte is taking 1012sec. At first glance it appears that the issue is with the DB queries.p  pSo, I loaded the Devel Module to start debugging the queries but I cant activate the query log  options since the the host of this domain has the ridiculously old v3.2.1 Zend Optimizer running on the server and wont upgrade or disable it for me. p  pSo my question is, What alternative do I have to Devel Module to debug the DB queries Anything would be appreciated... Module or a manual way of reviewing such queries for issues.p  pIts Drupal 7.3 on an IIS server with basically no control over the server configuration.p

Negative 360 pWe have a Delphi app that has been running for a few years and now suddenly we get weird access violations. We used Eurekalog to trace where it comes from and this is even more weird. They are so far all on the Free call of an object, but inside a try except block. One of them is even in 2 try except blocks and still when the Access Violation occurs it jumps totally out of the program and ignores the try excepts, nothing excepts EurekaLog catches it at the end. Really confused on why this is suddenly happening both instances are old code that has not been touched for years and also other codes changes is not related to it.p  pA example of the code is p  precode      try     if AssignedClientCommunication then   begin       if ClientCommunication.isConnected then  begin         if ClientCommunication.closeServerConnection then   begin           try             ClientCommunication.Free             ClientCommunication  nil           Except             on eException do begin              ClientCommunication  nil suppress weird AV error.. get read for new object             end           end codepre  pNow  the last try except was added later to try and suppress the AV as we just want the object cleared to be restarted if required, but this is mostly called when closing the app. But it still just jumps out of that and I cant catch it at all.p  pIt works on our developers PCs and not at the client.p
Negative 360 pIm trying to create a folder on network drive through windows application in C. p  pThe problem which Im facing is that while the .exe is getting installed it opens up a window and asks for the network drive path.

Negative 360 pI am trying to create a system that allows you to switch multiple data sources, e.g. switching from Entity Framework to Dapper. I am trying to find the best approach to do this. p  pAt the moment I have different projects for different data layers, e.g. codeData.EFcode for Entity Framework, codeData.Dappercode for Dapper. I have used a database approach but when it creates the models the information generated is coupled together and not easy to refactor, e.g. separation of models.p  pI have a project called emmodelsem, this holds domain and view models, and I was thinking of creating codeData.Corecode and follow the repository pattern. But then, doing this will add an extra layer so I would have Presentation  Business  Repository  Data.p  pI would like to know the best structure for this approach. Should I also do a codefirst approach to create my database This helps separate concerns and improve abstraction. This is quite a big application so getting the structure right is essential.p

Negative 360 pI need to store word cooccurrence counts in several 14000x10000 matrices. Since I know the matrices will be sparse and I do not have enough RAM to store all of them as dense matrices, I am storing them as scipy.sparse matrices.p  pI have found the most efficient way to gather the counts to be using Counter objects. Now I need to transfer the counts from the Counter objects to the sparse matrices, but this takes too long. It currently takes on the order of 18 hours to populate the matrices.p  pThe code Im using is roughly as followsp  precodefor wordind1 in rangelenwordlist1     for wordind2 in rangelenwordlist2         wordcounts[wordind2, wordind1]wordcounters[wordlist1[wordind1]][wordlist2[wordind2]] codepre  pWhere codewordcountscode is a scipy.sparse.lilmatrix object, codewordcounterscode is a dictionary of counters, and codewordlist1code and codewordlist2code are lists of strings.p  pIs there any way to do this more efficientlyp

Negative 360 pIm working on a program that runs basic smoke tests and acceptance tests on Windows applications under development.  Part of what it does is to snapshot the apps toplevel windows when itthey first appears.  It does this by starting the process, waiting for input idle, enumerating toplevel windows, and then getting the window DC and blitting from it.p  pIt turns out that the first appearance of a toplevel window is animated by defaultit fades in and expands to its actual sizeat least on Windows 7.  Screenshots taking during the animation are either missing the window frame or the frame is scaled down and partially transparent.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlpeVz.png altScreenshot of a HelloWorld app as the toplevel window appearance animation is in progressp  pI can avoid this problem by adding a delay e.g., codeSleep250code before taking the screenshot, but I cant find any information on how long the animations may actually take.  If the animation takes longer on a future version of Windows or if its user adjustable, this delay might not be long enough.  If the animations are disabled, then Im just wasting time.  The tool will be used to run many tests, so the quarter second delays could add up.p  pI can avoid the problem by checking the Turn off all unnecessary animations checkbox in the Ease of Access Center control panel, which seems to disable this animation.  I figured this might correspond to a setting or settings programmatically accessible via a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms72494728vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowSystemParametersInfoa.  If I could check when the animation is enabled, I could add the delay only when needed.  I could also consider disabling the animations for the duration of the tests and then restoring the users choice afterwards.p  pBut I cant seem to find the SPI setting that corresponds to this particular animation.  There is SPIGETANIMATION, which indicates whether minimize and restore animations are enabled.  However, that setting is independent of setting for the toplevel window appearance animation.p  pIs there an API to detect whether toplevel window appearance animations are enabled  Is there a setting that controls the speed of them so my code knows how long to delay  Is there a signal my program can watch for to know when a window from a child process is fully painted and finished animatingp

Negative 360 pI have an RTF string, that may or may not be prematurely truncated.  I want to be able to strip all the formatting tags from the RTF string leaving only the readable text behind.

Negative 360 pFrom my understanding, WebSockets has been designed to traverse firewalls and proxies.  Indeed, after an handshake between the client and the server, the communication protocol will change from HTTP to WS but it will still communicate on the port used to establish the handshake. See a hrefhttpwww.websocket.orgaboutwebsocket.html relnofollowwebsocket.orga.p  pIn other words, if a client can do an HTTP request on a given port, he will also be able to do WS on the same port.p  pHowever, according to a hrefhttpxsockets.netdocsconfiguration relnofollowXSockets configuration documentationa, the port used for WS communications isnt the same as the HTTP port.  Unlike a regular WS connection, a NAT on the firewall seems to be required to allow communication between the XSockets server and the client.p  pIs there a way to configure an XSockets server to reuse the HTTP port used for the handshake port 80 without creating conflicts with the existing web applications hosted on the same web server IISp

Negative 360 pI am looking for some advice on some data restructuring.   I am collecting some data using Google Forms which I download as a csv file and looks something like the following  p  precode alpha                 beta    option   6             8, 9, 10, 11    apple   9                        6     pear   1                        6    apple   3                     8, 9     pear   3                     6, 8     lime   3                        1    apple   2, 4, 7, 11              9     lime codepre  pThe data has two variables alpha and beta that each list numbers.  For the majority of my data there is only one number in each variable.  However, for some observations there can be two, three or even up to ten numbers. This is because these are responses gathered using the checkbox option in google forms which allows multiple answers to one survey question.  Also, it may be of importance to some potential solutions that google forms returns leading whitespace before each of the multiple answers.p  pIn my real data this occurs in only a very small proportion of all observations, the above is a more condensed example.  There are several other variables in the dataset.  Here I am just including one called option that contains factors.p  pWhat I need to do is to duplicate all observations that contain multiple numbers in either the alpha or the beta variable. The number of duplicated rows should be equal to the number of numbers that exist in the alpha or beta variable.   Then, I need to replace the sequence of numbers in the alpha or beta variables with each number independently.  That would result in something like the followingp  precode  alpha  beta   option      6    8     apple      6    9     apple      6   10     apple      6   11     apple      9    6      pear      1    6     apple      3    8      pear      3    9      pear      3    6      lime      3    8      lime      3    1     apple      2    9      lime      4    9      lime      7    9      lime     11    9      lime codepre  pHere is the data that reproduces the original example data above. I have called the dataframe demop  precodedemoltstructurelistalpha  structurec4L, 5L, 1L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 2L, .Label   c1,2, 4, 7, 11, 3, 6, 9, class  factor, beta  structurec5L, 2L, 2L,  4L, 3L, 1L, 6L, .Label  c1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 9, class     factor, option  structurec1L, 3L, 1L, 3L, 2L, 1L, 2L, .Label  capple,  lime, pear, class  factor, .Names  calpha, beta, option, class     data.frame, row.names  cNA, 7L codepre  pOK. So I think I have written some code that in a very longwinded fashion does lead to the new dataframe I am looking for.   However, it feels like there must be a more elegant and better way of doing it.  p  pBasically, I work on the alpha variable first.   I first subset the observations based on whether commas exist in the variable or not.  With the observations that contain commas, I then use strsplit to separate the numbers.  I then count how many numbers exist for each observation and duplicate each observation by that.  I then melt the split numbers into a dataframe with all the numbers in a variable named value.  I simply then replace the alpha variable with the data in the melted value variable.   I then rbind this back with the data that did not contain commas.   I then use this df and work on the beta variable....p  pHere is my solution it seems to workp  precodelibraryreshape2  demoaltgrepl,, demoalpha demo.atrue lt demo[ whichdemoaTRUE, ] demo.afalse lt demo[ whichdemoaFALSE, ] demo.atruealphaltas.characterdemo.atruealpha templtstrsplitdemo.atruealpha, , temp.lengthsltlapplytemp, length  for i in 1lengthtemp   df.expanded lt demo.atrue[reprow.namesdemo.atrue, temp.lengths, 13]   temp.meltltmelttemp df.expandedalphalttemp.meltvalue demo.afalseltdemo.afalse[c13] demonewltrbinddemo.afalse, df.expanded    demonewbltgrepl,, demonewbeta demonew.btrue lt demonew[ whichdemonewbTRUE, ] demonew.bfalse lt demonew[ whichdemonewbFALSE, ] demonew.btruebetaltas.characterdemonew.btruebeta  templtstrsplitdemonew.btruebeta, , temp.lengthsltlapplytemp, length  for i in 1lengthtemp     df.expanded1 lt demonew.btrue[reprow.namesdemonew.btrue, temp.lengths, 13]   temp.meltltmelttemp df.expanded1betalttemp.meltvalue demonew.bfalseltdemonew.bfalse[c13] demonew1ltrbinddf.expanded1, demonew.bfalse  demonew1  this seems to work, but doesnt feel very efficient codepre  pAs well as perhaps not being very efficient, I am not sure whether this will work in all conditions. In particular if multiple numbers exist in both the alpha and beta variables for the same observation. I have tested it with a few examples and it seems ok, but I am not confident with it.p  pThank you for any consideration.p

Negative 360 pSorry kinda frustrated, so asking for some help. And yeah similar questions have been asked before but I didnt fina way to resolve this.p  pI am getting a System.OutOfMemoryException when trying to read a group of images and rotate them. Essentially, I have a large number of images. I want to read each image into memory and then rotate the image 90, 180, and 270 degrees and save each rotated image out as a file.p  pI do not have corrupted images. If I read each image individually and rotate them one at a time everything works fine. All images to rotate exist in the same directory. The directory can hold up to several hundred images. Each individual image is in itself not that large average size lt 1 mb stored as a .PNG file. All images are saved as PNG files. p  pIn addition, I have a server that I am running on. It is a dual CPU machine. Each CPU has 8 processors with hyperthreading. That makes 32 processorsthreads. This machine has 64gb of ram. I want to use these resources to process the images in parallel using .net 4.5 and I cannot do so and cant figure out why.

I have a coderesourcecode which GETs, POSTs, etc my API endpoints, but when my data is returned, it is stored in my JS object as as String.  I figure that it would be easier to handle as a Date or a Moment.p  pIn Java, I can use a codeJsonDeserializercode to ensure that all JSON data is properly converted prior to being assigned to the model, but I dont know if there is a similar mechanism in AngularJS.p  pIve searched around, but cant seem to find anything that implements a generalized solution.  I realize that I can use a codetransformResponsecode function in my coderesourcecode, but that seems like a lot of repeated configuration for every data type that may contain a date.p  pThis leads me to wonder if returning the date in an ISO8601 format is the best way to proceed  If AngularJS doesnt support it out of the box, I presume that there must be an easier way to deal with dates.  How does one deal with dates in AngularJS  Should I just be treating them as textstring objects, and have the API return a preformatted version  If so, what is the most flexible format to use in an HTML5 date input box, etcp

Fact, that transferred data and bandwidth are printed out strongafterstrong the end of each interval and transferred data is sometimes bit more or less than the bandwidth specified with the b flag, should mean that Iperf client actually somehow counts the sent data and doesnt just print the argument of bbandwidth flag. Still, how does Iperf client count the amount of data it sends It sure doesnt do this on low level because if I introduce 10 packet loss with codetccode, execute codeiperf c 178.62.60.141 fm b 100m u t 30 i 10code and then compare the packets Iperf client thought it sentfrom Iperf client output with the amount of packets actually were put to wirefrom codeip s link show dev eth0code output, then Iperf client thought that it sent 250k datagrams while it actually did just bit over 230k.

Negative 360 pI have a project where i have some dynamically builded DataGrids winform that are generated according to some configuration inside some xml files in a directory. In fact, there is one xml for each DataGrid the file has the same name of the DataGrid and this xml contains information about DataGrids columns and database table on which the grid should be binded to.p  pWith the same information above, a panel for each grid is generated, and it contains the fields needed to filter each columns.p  pAt moment i have applied to my project the example described at this link  a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comTips582450BuildWhereClauseDynamicallyinLinq relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comTips582450BuildWhereClauseDynamicallyinLinqap  pto dynamically filter my table using a dynamic where linq clause onto table datasource datasource is simply a select all over the underlying table.p  pWhat i would achieve is an optimizations, because if there are a lot of data, the db extraction could be expensive. So i would build a dynamic linq to sql where clause instead of a dynamic linq query over a list with all table entry.p  pHow can i do that p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 360 pAccording to Wikipedia in article about initrd strongemMany Linux distributions ship a single, generic kernel image  one that the distributions developers intend will boot on as wide a variety of hardware as possible. The device drivers for this generic kernel image are included as loadable modules because statically compiling many drivers into one kernel causes the kernel image to be much larger, perhaps too large to boot on computers with limited memory. This then raises the problem of detecting and loading the modules necessary to mount the root file system at boot time, or for that matter, deducing where or what the root file system is. To avoid having to hardcode handling for so many special cases into the kernel, an initial boot stage with a temporary root filesystem  now dubbed early user space  is used. This root filesystem can contain userspace helpers which do the hardware detection, module loading and device discovery necessary to get the real root filesystem mounted.emstrong p  pMy question is if we add modules etc needed to load actual filesystem in initrd not in actual kernel image to save save then what we will achieve in case of Bootpimage where both kernel and initrd are combined to form a single bootpimage. This size of kernel would increase even by using initrd. p  pCan someone clarify p

Negative 360 pIve been given a problem to solve which, at first glance, appears to be some sort of generalized assignment problem a subset of combinatorial optimization problems a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGeneralizedassignmentproblem relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGeneralizedassignmentproblema.p  pThe description of the problem is quite unclear and not written in English please bear with me as I try to explain it as best I canp  pI am given a set of cuts tasks to be performed on large marble blocks of specific sizes. The goal is to complete every task in a given list while minimizing the amount of marble lost. If I have, for example, a starting block of size 20, then I can cut it in different ways to fulfill a certain amount of tasks while making sure I dont lose marble in the process. If I need subblocks of 3, 5, 6 and 6, then a block of initial size 20 will do just fine as I will have no lost marble 3566  20.p  pThus, the goal is to fulfill every task whilst losing as little marble as possible. I may use any number of starting blocks, so long as the tasks are all completed. One additionnal constraint is that each task which specifies a subblock of length L also has a class assigned to it, which represents what specific machine is required to do this specific cut. Given a starting block, I am unable to use more than strong3strong different classes to cut my block. I can do as many cuts as I want on one machine, as long as I dont change classes more than twice.p  pHere is an example of data that can be given to mep  precode2 20 38 7 20 4 1 7 1 3 1 25 1 22 2 22 1 20 2 17 1 10 1 22 2 27 2 26 2 15 3 13 4 12 5 15 6 27 4 27 5 27 7 27 2 codepre  pThe first line gives the number of different blocks that can be used to perform all given tasks, as well as the sizes of each starting block.p  pThe second line gives the total number of different classes of cuts, which represent the number of different machines that can execute the needed cuts.p  pThe third line gives the total amount of cuts tasks needed to complete the operation. In this case, exactly 20 tasks need to be performed to complete the problem.p  pThe rest of the lines give the needed cut as well as the class associated with this task.p  pTo recapitulate, I need to perform a certain list of tasks with any number of given starting blocks whilst attempting to minimize the amount of lostunwanted marble.p  pSo my question is strongWhat is a good approach to this problemstrong I believe a greedy approximation algorithm might be a straightforward and simple way to find a reasonable solution, but Im honestly not sure.p  pI apologize in advance if the given problem is unclear, if you need addtionnal information then feel free to make a request for clearer instructions.p  pThanksp  pPS The algorithm will be written in Java, if that helps.p

According to the manual a hrefhttplast.cbrc.jpdocmafconvert.txt relnofollowhttplast.cbrc.jpdocmafconvert.txta, mafconvert takes the first topmost MAF sequence as the reference subject  target, and the second sequence as the query.

Negative 360 pandroid.view.ScaleGestureListener uses getX and getY relative coordinates of the touch event to the view instead of getRawX and getRawY absolute coordinates of the touch event on screen when calculating scaling factor for a pinch gesture. When implementing a pinch gesture that scales the view, this results in an oscillating flickering of the view scale. This is because the scaling has an effect in getX and getY values. My question is how to properly do a pinch gesture detection that does scale the view and doesnt flicker Im using Galaxy S5 as a testing device and target sdk version is 19p  pFor now Ive ended up listening pinch with an invisible view on top of the view that is being scaled. Unfortunately pinch detection requires that the onTouch MotionEvent ACTIONDOWN is detected and handled by the invisible view. Down side of this approach is that the invisible view eats all the MotionEvents and for example clicks in the original view child components arent any more detected.p

So when I do the next code.readcode command it simply returns the previously captured image and adds one to the buffer. Im doing a bit of guess work here but I think this is what is happening. This would explain why the example from the docs above works fine, and this all makes sense with regards to things you would want in case of a live stream, but not in my case.p  pHas anyone seen this behaviour before A workaroundp  pstrongEDIT2strongp  pI inserted the following codep  precodefor ii in range10     cap.grab codepre  pright after the line codedef getFramecap, fnimagecode and thinks work, however Im dubmstruck at this and still dont quite understand it.

This serves as a shared library for bridge between networking code and application code. Naturally, it has its own dependencies ZMQ network library, MsgPack serialization, ... which are statically linked using .lib files. My .dll is generated normally and its exported .lib file too. Before I switched to dll project I kept compiling it as .exe to test the code as I coded...p  pApp project This project is an application project and would like to use the bridge to gain full access to networking functionality via bridge. So I add the .lib dependency to it and I know I will have to supply the .dll to the .exep  pHowever my problem is, that the application will not compile, because it is missing header files from ZMQwhich are a bridge .dll dependencies, and not relevant to the app at all, since only bridge internal BL uses them. Is there any way I can bakeinclude all my required dependencies to the bridge dll ZMQ, MsgPack, Log4cpp .... and provided just the bridge.dll to the app ofc, with bridge.lib as a library input Am I misunderstanding something obvious here and am going at this completely the wrong wayp  pThanks for help, greatly appreciated p

Negative 360 pIm querying a domain controller by LDAP by means of the DirectoryEntry class, and I need to store the username and password for this query on the machine thats running the application. Storing these in strings is not feasible as thats a big security risk.p  pIve decided to use DPAPI, however Im a bit new to the encryptiondecryption of data in C. When decrypted, this data will have to be temporarily stored in  string variables and then used as arguments to the DirectoryEntry constructor, at least according to my understanding. Do correct me if Im wrong.p  pWont this username and password be vulnerable to attack once decrypted for use with the methods for making the LDAP query Specifically the creation of a new DirectoryEntry object.p  pI could try to circumvent this by having the application request the user to input the username and password each time a query is to be made, however theyll still have to be stored in strings for use with the DirectoryEntry constructor.p  pHow can I reuse a username and password in combination with the DirectoryEntry constructor without this data being vulnerable to attack and visible in memoryp

Negative 360 pI need to call a function with a variable delay in Corona SDK.  I am trying to create a function which will execute a chunk of code which checks to see if the timer.performWithDelay function should keep looping, and cuts it off if the conditions are right.  That code is not pertinent, however.  I just need to have a loop of delayed functions calls whose delay time can vary.  Right now, I am using the following codep  precodetime  500  local function foo time      print time  end  timer.performWithDelay time, function                                  time  time  100                                 foo time                                end, 10  codepre  pObviously, this isnt working.

Negative 360 pAdding a Google Map plugin to our homepage, which updates a single marker dynamically whenever there is a new product search on our site which we read from our database.  So, has there been a new search via our site If yes, reposition the marker based on the new searchs coords.p  pCurrently every n seconds havent settled on a seconds value yet an Ajax call is made using SetInterval to determine if there has been a new search, and if there has it returns a small JSON response.  The script run via the Ajax call is a PHP script, which queries the database for the last row in our searches table order by desc limit 1.p  pSo, my question is not being a sysadmin, could this setup put an undesirable strain on our server  Should i incorporate a timeout session, or something, which turns off the Ajax call after 100 goes, or after 15 mins i mean, who sits for 15 mins looking at markers dynamically generate on a Google map.p  pOur homepage only receives roughly 200 visits a day.p

As a result, only some of the data is actually copied in this example case, the ID, but not the name.  p  pIt seems to me that since both cachedObj and oldCachedObjs are guaranteed to be Person objects if its a PersonCache, the copyTo method that should be called is the one on the Person class.p  pI feel like there must be something about how generics work that Im missing that is causing this behavior.  I know if I override copyTo in the Person class to be a signature of copyToDBObject other rather than copyToPerson other it then does call the copyTo on the person class  but thatd be a sloppy way to rewrite it and I think Im missing something that might be cleaner.p

Negative 360 pWhen building a c project in Visual Studio 2008 in this case, the compiler checks for each source file if there is already an .obj file and only rebuilds the .obj file if any of the input files, which are headers and a source file, are newer than the .obj. p  pThis fails if any of the input files are symlinks because Visual Studio doesnt follow symlinks and only looks at the change date of the symlink itself.p  pE.g. codeTest.cpp symlink 1530code points to code..CommonSourceTest.cpp changed 1638code should produce  codeTest.obj changed 1531code. Unfortunately VS wont follow symlinks and doesnt see that the original file was updated.p  pGNU make and gcc can follow symlinks, is there an equivalent in Visual Studio or is there another option for Windows The change date of a symlink should also reflect the change date of the original file, IMHO, since a symlink cant be changed in Windows anyway.p

Negative 360 pI am trying to get the value of the codehrefcode attribute of an anchor element from a web page using a selfmade Python script. However, all of the contents of the codedivcode element inside which the anchor element sits are received by the web page by using AJAX jQuery calls when the web page initially loads. The codedivcode element contains about 90 of the web pages content. How can I get the contents of the codedivcode element and then the value of the codehrefcode attribute of the anchor element p  pLater, after I get the value of the href attribute, I want to get the contents of the web page that the link points to. But unfortunately, that call is also made with AJAX jQuery. When I click on this in the web browser, the address of the web page does not change in the address bar, which means that the contents of the web page that is received is loaded into the same web page inside the above mentioned codedivcode element.p  pAfter I get this, I will be using BeautifulSoup to parse the web page. So, how will I be able to do this with Python What sort of modules do I need to use And what is the general pseudocode requiredp  pBy the way, the anchor element has an codeonclickcode event handler that triggers the corresponding jQuery function that loads the contents into the codedivcode element inside the web page.p  pMoreover, the anchor element is not associated with an id, if its needed for the solution.p

It worked up until one point and then all of a sudden stopped.p  pI took a look on our DC and the computer is still registered there but it is a blank shell. I manually edited the Attributes to match what it used to be and that did not fix it either. I also tried removing and readding the computer from AD but to no avail.p  pI had the laptop sent to my office and had a look at it and it worked perfectly. No issue signing in at all. When I sent it back the original issue appeared again.p  pIs this due to the wireless connection it is connected to Or just a coincidencep  pThanks.p

When a tab position is moved, its index is updated. Here is my problem. Lets say I have 4 tabs, each representing some object Foo but with different parameters. That means its important to me that I know exacly which object is at which position. When I close the tab I would like to destroy the proper Foo object so I need to keep track of him. When I move a tab it changes its index, so lets say I have the object I am interested in within tab 0 and I move it one place behind, that way it is now with index 1 not 0. How can I know that How to get notified if indexes changes I have a list of that objects as separate property. That way if one closes the tab I can destroy and then remove an item from the list with corresponding index but only If i wont move the tabs, because then they change indexes. I havent posted any code examples because this is a very general problem, but if it is needed I can do it of course. I would aprichiate all help regarding thisp

If you dont need to do anything with the   relationship model, it may be simpler to set up a   hasandbelongstomany relationship though youll need to remember   to create the joining table in the database.   You should use hasmany through if you need validations, callbacks,   or extra attributes on the join model.p blockquote  pIm not sure what is meant by if you need to work with the relationship model as an independent entity. In my use case is a moderator will have additional rights. The association will, I belief, be used in two ways 1 displaying the moderators for an organization, and displaying the organizations that a user is the moderator of and 2 look up if a user has moderator rights to allow him these rights. So I dont belief I will need validations organization will itself be able to select users as moderator or extra attributes. Im not sure about callbacks dont know exactly what they are.p  pSo in short, which one of the two forms of association is the best association in my use casep

Negative 360 pI have coded a very basic user interface on NetBeans that has a Frame, a label as a title in the frame, and a panel. The panel is going to contain labels and text fields in it.

Negative 360 pI have been trying to figure out this problem for ages and tried at least 10 solutions on stack overflow with no success. p  pI have created a Widget class that display some numbers on the home screen which updates every 5 minutes. The Widget is a button, which when the user clicks on it, the configuration activity is loaded up so the widget can be updated. p  pWhen I create the widget the first time, the configuration activity opens and users can type in the text box. Once the configuration is done, the widget is updated  all working as intended. However when the button is pressed the configuration activity does not launch again. The weird thing is that when I re run the app via android studio or reboot the phone, the activity can be launched. I think it has to do with it not updating the button pressing for some reason, but I cannot find where to fix it.p  pI have seen a couple of similar questions that have my issue and tried their solutions but it does not work at all. I am pretty new at android programming so I might have overlooked something. I have hard coded some variable pretty badly which needed to be changed but I dont think that would affect the launching of the activity.p  pHere is my WidgetProvider, Configuration Activity classes and the manifest.p  pLPWidget.javap  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic class LPWidget extends AppWidgetProvider  private static final String LOGTAG  ExampleWidget static int nowLP  LPWidgetConfigureActivity.currentLP  static int maxNowLP  LPWidgetConfigureActivity.maxLP static boolean notfirstTime  false      Custom Intent name that is used by the AlarmManager to tell us to update the clock once per second.   public static String CLOCKWIDGETUPDATE  doingitnow.simplelptracker.CLOCKWIDGETUPDATE  Override public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent      super.onReceivecontext, intent      if CLOCKWIDGETUPDATE.equalsintent.getAction          Log.dLOGTAG, Clock update          Get the widget manager and ids for this widget provider, then call the shared          clock update method.

Negative 360 pId like to design a django page where a custom user, lets say a teacher class, can manage student users in a list with the ability to remove them from the site. This would be a sort of custom admin page, where the teacher would have the ability to manage students, but not have access to the actual django admin site. In the actual function of the site, students and teachers would see different pages based on their user type. Whats the best way to go about implementing this for someone not well versed in django edit I should clarify this user manager page would not be the actual admin site, just a list box with users and the ability to manage them. p

Negative 360 pI am a freshman in Matlabjava and I am writing a Matlab program calling a Java class I wrote with javaaddpath. I used several jar packages something.jar I download from the Internet. When I call my Java class in Matlab, error came out at the place I called my Jar file. So I am considering to add these jar files to the path as well. The jar packages I used contained some Java classes so I am wondering if I should import these classes. However, when I decided to import them, I download the source code and discovered that they called other jar packages as well. So what should I do Import all the jar packages Is there a convenient way to do this Please give me some examples. It is better that the static path do not need to be changed. Thanks a lotp

As soon as the internal counter reaches 0 the process is destroyed with a WMQUIT message.p  pThis works fine in IE8 and the process is destroyed as soon as the last tab referencing the ActiveX component is closed. In IE11 the process is kept alive, though it seems to be destroyed after approx. 15 minutes finally the GCp  pExample client side codep  precodeltscriptgt var myComponent  document.createElementobject myComponent.classid  clsidE0E040F0B4B640CE8C2133355561C5A5 myComponent.id  myComponent body.appendmyComponent myComponent.name  myComponent ltscriptgt     ltscriptgt     commenting this out allows process to be destroyed     function myComponentOnResultdata, errorcode          alertdata      ltscriptgt     ltscriptgt         function                button.clickfunction                                     myComponent.GetStufffoobar                     ltscriptgt codepre  pProcessing is async.

Negative 360 pSometime in the past week or two, the Storyboard editor in Xcode 7 beta then beta 5, now also still in beta 6 stopped recognizing the IBOutlets in emsomeem not all of my UIViewController subclasses. NOTE my app is a pure Swift 2, iOS 9targeting project.p  pSpecifically, it cannot see the IBOutlets in VCs whose source files reside within my projects appspecific main folder, but it emcanem see them in generic, nonappspecific VCs that I keep in an Externals folder. Whats more, if I move those appspecific VCs out of the main folder, the Storyboard editor sees their IBOutlets just finep  precodeltProject Foldergt     IIAM.xcodeproj     lt Project     Externals          lt Where I keep nonappspecific code and resources         Classes             Views      lt The Storyboard Editor sees the IBOutlets of all these files just fine     IIAM               lt All appspecific code and resources         Classes             Views      lt The Storyboard Editor  doesnt recognize any IBOutlets of these files codepre  pBut if I move the affected Views out of the IIAM folderp  precodeltProject Foldergt     IIAM.xcodeproj     lt Project     Externals          lt Where I keep nonappspecific code and resources         Classes             Views      lt The Storyboard Editor  sees the IBOutlets of all these files just fine     IIAM                      lt All appspecific code and resources         Classes     Views                    lt The Storyboard Editor  does recognize IBOutlets these files when moved out here codepre  pIn the Storyboard Editor , the module property for all the classes that arent recognized is empty note it doesnt have the default, greyedout Current  IIAM, it just has greyedout None   and even if I set the module name to that of my project, the IBOutlets still arent recognized. Meanwhile, the modules of the VCs under Externals emdoem have the greyedout Current  IIAM.p  pSo, it seems evident that the underlying problem is that the Storyboard Editor and possibly Xcode generally doesnt recognize my appspecific VCs as beloing to the apps module when they are stored under my appspecific IIAM folder which, BTW, is where the AppDelegate and nearly all classes and resources are also located, but does when they are moved out of that folder.p  pI checked my targets build settings to confirm that all my VCs external and appspecific are specified. Ive even gone so far as to examine the XML of my storyboard file, to see if I could spot any difference in how the VCs are specified and identified therein, and I did notice one thing those VCs whose IBOutlets are recognized all have the attributesp  precode customModuleIIAM customModuleProvidertarget codepre  pwhile at least most of those whose IBOutlets arent recognized lacked the customModuleProvidertarget attribute. But even after I edited the storyboard file to set that attribute for all my VCs, the Storyboard Editor stil doesnt recognize them as belonging to my apps module, or recgonzie their IBOutlets. Ive tried cleaning, rebuilding, nuking all Xcode preferences and derived data, reinstalling Xcode, and yet nothing makes any difference except moving my VCs to the top level of the project directory.p  pNote that my app still executes fine, emifem I manually add or replace IBOutlets in my source by controldragging from the storyboard BUT even when I do that, all such IBOutlets show up as unrecognized by the Storyboard Editor, with the little yellow warning icons. And of course I have to manually add emallem IBOutlets this way, even those for such things as the view  which I then have to immediately delete from the VC source because of course it conflicts with the inherited view property, but this emdoesem at least make a yellowwarning IBOutlet show up, and lets the app then runp  pSo, Im at a complete loss. Has anyone else encountered this behavior Does anyone have any idea how I might be able to fix the problemp  pHelp And thanksp  pCarlp
