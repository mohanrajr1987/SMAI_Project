So I believe the .L4 section is the loop of the delay function, which is 6 instructions long. I do realise that clock cycles are not always the same as instructions but since theres such a large difference, and since this is a loop which I imagine is predicted and pipelined efficiently, I am wondering if theres a solid reason that I am seeing 2 clock cycles per instruction.p  pBackground In the project I am working on I need to use 5 output pins to control a linear ccd, and the timing requirements are said to be fairly tight. Absolute frequency will not be maxed out I will clock the pins slower than the cpu is capable of but pin timings relative to each other are important. So rather than use interupts which are at the limit of my ability and might complicate relative timings I am thinking use loops to provide the short delays around 100 ns between pin voltage change events, or even code the whole section in unrolled assembler since I have plenty of program storage space. There is a period when the pins are not changing during which I can run the ADC to sample the signal.p  pAlthough the odd behaviour I am asking about is not a show stopper I would rather understand it before proceeding.p  pEdit From comment, the arm tech ref gives instruction timings. I have added them to the assembly. But its still only a total of 9 cycles rather than the 12 I expect. Is the jump a cycle itselfp  pTIA, Petep  pThink I have to give this one to ElderBug although Dwelch raised some points which might also be very relevant so thanks to all. Going from this I will try using unrolled assembly to toggle the pins which are 20ns apart in their changes and then return back to C for the longer waits, and ADC conversion, then back to assembly to repeat the process, keeping an eye on the assembly output from gcc to get a rough idea of whether my timings look OK. BTW Elder the modified waitcycles function does work as expected as you said. Thanks again.p
Positive 2280 pIm writing a driver to control GPIO pins. I have identified JP4 connector and added a LED on gpio91 codeJP4.06code  codesysclassgpiogpio91code. After reading many tutorials I have written a simple kernel module. This module receives an input from user space and based on input I am setting gpio like codegpiosetvalue91,truecode. Before calling codegpiosetvaluecode, I am calling one more function i.e codegpiodirectionoutputcode. And thus led is glowing. On the other hand when I am getting other command from user space to get status of PIN for this I am relying on codegpiogetvalue91code and for this also setting direction to input, here I am not getting proper value.p  pAm I missing any step to get desired value How should I attempt doing thisp

The ARM uses LDRB instruction to load byte and STRB instruction to store byte into individual bytes in memory. Thereby, from my point of view, LDRB is a bit slower than LDR, because LDRB do zeroextending every time when accessing a memory and load to register. In other words, we cant just load a byte into the 32bit registers, we should cast byte to word.p  pBenchmarks iPhone 5sp  precodesize  1000000 iterations  500   seconds  5.905090 char mostFrequentCharOpt1char str[], int size   seconds  5.874684 int mostFrequentCharOpt2char str[], int size codepre  pChanging codecharcode type to codeintcode didnt give me a significant increase of speed on iPhone 5s, by way of contrast, running the same code on iPhone 4 gave a different result  p  pBenchmarks iPhone 4p  precodesize  1000000 iterations  500   seconds  28.853877 char mostFrequentCharOpt1char str[], int size   seconds  27.328955 int mostFrequentCharOpt2char str[], int size codepre  pstrongLoop optimizationstrongp  pNext, I did a loop optimization, where, instead of incrementing codeicode value, I decremented it. p  precodebefore     forint i  0 iltsize i  ...   after forint i  size i  ...  codepre  pAgain, comparing assembly code, gave me a clear distinction between the two approaches.p  precodemostFrequentCharOpt2                                                    mostFrequentCharOpt3 0x10001250c lt88gt  ldr    w8, [sp, 28]  w8  i                       0x100012694 lt92gt  ldr    w8, [sp, 28]                                              w8  i 0x100012510 lt92gt  ldr    w9, [sp, 44]  w9  size                    0x100012698 lt96gt  sub    w9, w8, 1  w9  i  1                                            0x100012514 lt96gt  cmp    w8, w9  if iltsize                           0x10001269c lt100gt str    w9, [sp, 28]  save w9 to memmory 0x100012518 lt100gt b.ge   0x100012548  if true gt end loop            0x1000126a0 lt104gt cbz    w8, 0x1000126c4  compare w8 with 0 and if w8  0 gt go to 0x1000126c4 0x10001251c lt104gt ... setchar start routine                          0x1000126a4 lt108gt ... setchar start routine ...                                                                     ... 0x100012534 lt128gt ... setchar end routine                            0x1000126bc lt132gt ... setchar end routine 0x100012538 lt132gt ldr    w8, [sp, 28]  w8  i                       0x1000126c0 lt136gt b      0x100012694  back to the first line 0x10001253c lt136gt add    w8, w8, 1  i                             0x1000126c4 lt140gt ... 0x100012540 lt140gt str    w8, [sp, 28]  save i to sp28              0x100012544 lt144gt b      0x10001250c  back to the first line          0x100012548 lt148gt str    ...                                           codepre  pHere, in place of accessing codesizecode from the memory and comparing it with the codeicode variable, where the codeicode variable, was incrementing, we just decremented codeicode by 0x1 and compared the register, where the codeicode is  stored, with 0.p  pBenchmarks iPhone 5sp  precodesize  1000000 iterations  500   seconds  5.874684 char mostFrequentCharOpt2char str[], int size Type optimization   seconds  5.577797 char mostFrequentCharOpt3char str[], int size Loop otimization codepre  pstrongThreading optimizationstrongp  pReading the question accurately gives us at least one more optimization.

Positive 2280 pI am trying to understand how interrupts work in an ARM architectureARM7TDMI to be specific.

I have the following questions.brbr 1. When the I and F bits in CPSRstatus register are set to 1 to disable external and fast interrupt, does the other 5 exceptions are also disabled brbr 2. If the SWI is not disabled when I and F bits are enabled then, is it possible to intentionally trigger a SWI exception within ISR of an external interruptbrbr 3.When any interrupt is triggered saving the CPSR to SPSR, changing the mode is done by the processor itself. So, is it enough to write the ISR handler function and update the vector table with the handler addressesI dont want to save r0 to r12 general purpose registers brbr 4. Whenever the mode of execution is changed does context saving happens internally by the processoreven when we change the mode manuallybrbr 5. How to maskdisable a SWI exception brbrbr Thank you.p

Positive 2280 pMy Understanding on ARM MMU is low and trying to understand how Page table is organised in ARM MMU.p  pPage table is created at system boot up time and can be thought of as linear one dimensional array where each entry is 4 byte long but I dont understand what is 1 MB SECTION corresponds to in Page tablep  pIf we have three level of page table, would our first level page tablePGD contains this 1 MB section or would it 1 MB section be only  part of third level page table PTEp  pAlso what it meant by following statementp  pThe start of the page table is 0x40200000, each entry is 4 bytes long and each entry corresponds to a 1MB section of memory. The first entry in the page table 0x40200000 represents what happens when you try to access memory between the range of 0x00000000 to 0x00100000, the second entry 4 bytes into the table at 0x40200004 represents the memory range 0x00100000 to 0x00200000, etc.p  pTherefore to find the page table associated with area of memory 0x40200000 to 0x402000001MB which is the 402nd MB of memory  you need to traverse the page table list by 402 entries  but each entry is 4 bytes long therefore you need to time this number by 4.p

Negative 2280 pI am pretty new to ASP.NET MVC and I am trying to get my head around some of the design concepts at the moment. One thing I am currently stuck on is how best to handle a situation such as that described below.p  pSuppose I have a page that needs to render a number of sections. For example, on the left hand side there is a list that is data driven and then the selected item in the list displays a further list in another section on the page. For better understanding lets suggest the left hand list is a list of movie categories and the other list displays a list of movies that are contained within that category, along with the various movie details.p  pNow, I have some form of ORM such as Entity Framework, LINQ to SQL or whatever that maps the tblCategory and tblMovie database tables into Category and Movie entities respectively. These entities live in the MyMVCApp.Data.Entities namespace. I then use a repository pattern located in the MyMVCApp.Data namespace to encapsulate the queries via LINQ against these entities to return our model entities.p  pThis is where my first question lies. Should the repository be returning view model entities or domain entities which are then extended to produce view model entities In my naive mind I see the entities returned from the ORM as simply containers for the data with domain entities containing the business logic. So surely there should be an abstration herep  pAnyway, back to my scenario. Now lets assume I wish to present the two sections described at the beginning of this. I am assuming that what should be happening here is my domain entity model would contain a list of categories and their associated movies. So something like a List each of which contains a List. p  pThis model would have been populated somewhere. This is my second question. Say my assumption above is correct and it is simply data entities are returned from the ORM. Now I have a namespaceproject called MyMVCApp.Core.Model or the like with some domain entities such as the Movie and Category entities mentioned in the previous paragraph. Do these entities have methods on them to retrieve the data from the ORM and populate themselves Or does the repository retrieve these populated entity models And another question on this part, if I have a Movie and Customer entity in my ORM is it acceptable to be having domain entities named the samep  pFinally, I assume the controller now has this populated list of Category and Movie objects and passes it back to the view. I am guessing it is best to have each of the sections described at the beginning as partial views and passing the populated model to each So, it may be the IndexController which retrieves the populated CategoryMovies entity, passing this to the Categories partial view and the Movies partial view.

Negative 2280 pIn Java, it is very easy to code the following designp  precodepublic abstract class Pizza      public static final Pizza.NULL  new Pizza           null implementations             actualabstract implmentations   codepre  pWhat is the preferred method to attain the same efficient scenario in ObjectiveC I have been unable to find any documentation on the subject, and I have tried a couple different scenarios with codestatic constcode, codedefinecode etc. but none of them seem to work out as well as the Java method above.p  pI would like to avoid writing a concrete NullPizza class that has a static method to obtain the singleton instance, as it seems more proper for it to be some final propertyfield of the highestlevel interface. Pizza, in this case.p  pstrongEditstrong While I understand how the NULL pattern specifically would be handled due to ObjCs unique method of handling method calls to nil, what about other static common instances, such as Response.YES and Response.NO See comments for discussion.p
Negative 2280 pI have a model which is essentially just a string django.db.models.CharField. There will only be several instances of this model stored. How could I use those values as choices in a formp  pTo illustrate, the model could be codeBlogTopiccode. Id like to offer users the ability to choose one or several topics to subscribe to.p  pI started writing something likep  precodefrom mysite.blog.models import BlogTopic  choices  [topic.id, topic.name for topic in BlogTopic.objects.all]  class SubscribeFormforms.Form     topics  forms.ChoiceFieldchoiceschoices codepre  pBut Im not sure when codechoicescode would be defined. I assume only when the module is first imported i.e. when starting Django. Obviously that is not a very good approach.p  pThis seems like it would be a common requirement, but I cant seem to find any examples. I suspect I may be missing something obvious here. Anyway, thanks in advance for your answers.p
Negative 2280 pThe design Ive been given for an iPhone app Im working on calls for a 1px red line at the bottom of the navigation bar.

In many cases its sufficient to point the finder to the install location for the bundle locations to be known, but sometimes even thats not enough I have to run the application first before its bundle ID can be used to find the path. I should mention that I am using an installer that copies the applications to the Applications, so the finder never opens when I install the apps.p  pIt appears that when an application bundle is newly installed, it takes the system some time before some internal registry is updated that maps the bundle ID to the bundle location.

But then again, agile development is designed at its very core to have iteration and publishing cycles as quickly as possible.p  pWhere do you draw the line Am I wrong that I keep wanting to delay publishing products until I feel they are extremely worthy of a users time Am I missing out on marketing, growth or other opportunities because I dont release earlyp  pId be very interested in your opinions on this topic.

With my limited knowledge of Firebug, however, I did find out that the following were the responses when I entered email and confirmemail in the fieldsp  pstrongRESPONSE 1strong successy,msgemailEmail availablep  pstrongRESPONSE 2strong successy,msgemailEmail availablesuccessn,msgconfirmemailEmail and Confirm Email do NOT match.p  pAlthough the RESPONSE 2 shows that we are receiving the correct message via msgconfirmemail, in the front end, the alert Some error is popping up I have enabled the alert for debugging. I have spent 48 hours trying to change every part of the code wherever possible, but with only little success. What is weird about this is that if I comment the validation for codePOST[email]code field completely, then the validation for codePOST[confirmemail]code field is displaying correctly without any errors. If I enable it back, it is validating email field correctly, but when it reaches the point of validating confirmemail field, it is again showing me the error. p  pI have also tried renaming success variable in checkajax2.php page to other different names for both codePOST[email]code and codePOST[confirmemail]code but no success. I will be adding more fields in the form and validating within the checkajax2.php page. So I am not planning on using different ajax pages for validating each of those fields and I dont think its smart to do it that way. I am not a jquery or AJAX guru, so all help in resolving this issue is highly appreciated.p  pThank you in advance.p

Now the rewrite rules are back to just alpha and  and  and my security concerns are less and it loads the resources I want.  But I still need the actual target directory name for display purposes.

I can work around this by right clicking the exe and running as Administrator. This isnt ideal however as its an extra step I need to notify our clients of performing.

Negative 2280 pHas anyone experienced a case where a .Net Windows Forms app caused severe desktop flickerp  pI have a Windows Forms app .Net 3.5 , C with a datagridview in a usercontrol.  Occasionally, while running other applications at the same time I see it with Louts Notes, but the worst behavior is a user with Reuters Bridge Station , switching to my app and then to the other app causes the entire desktop to flicker, freezing all user interactions, from a few seconds to close to a minute. All users using Windows XP Professional This happens even with a small amount of data in the grid I am not doing any custom painting in the app, and I am pretty certain none of my code is running at this time to call any refreshes or repaints. p  pI have already enabled doublebuffering, so thats not the solution. p  pOne interesting thing I found in a MS forum is that setting the TransparencyKey of the form will solve the problem   sometimes. specifically for the Louts Notes users, but not for the Bridge Station users.  The users still affected are working around it by minimizing the app after data entry, before switching to the other apps. Any ideas will be greatly appreciated, as I am pulling out my hair over this. And I do not have too much hair to start with.p  pYSp

Negative 2280 pHi this is a question to all experienced developers who create their web applications using ASP.NETC with MySQL. I am currently using the Microsoft Enterprise Library to implement a database factory design pattern. p  pI have a DAL which returns a DataTable. I have a BLL that executes that DAL which returns a Listlt of my DataObjects. The BLL has parameters for sorting, limit records, and filters.p  pWhat do you think is by far a good design pattern that will work for transactional queries and queries containing a number of joins 4 to 10 tables and conditions.p  pI am not satisfied with the current implementation and I dont know if itll work for me in the long run. I keep on creating DataObjects  BLL  DAL classes every time.p
Negative 2280 pIm updating legacy code, written in VB6, and Ive come across the need for a mutex. I have two sockets, and I need to send and receive from various sources. So I plan on having one socket continuously listening for incoming connections, then the other is used to send or receive.p  pA timer checks twenty times a second if a connection has come in, and if so, uses the second socket to accept it, then begins listening again immediately. If a second connection comes in before the first has finished receiving data, it needs to wait in C Id throw a lock on it and call it done.p  pAlso, if the program needs to emsendem data, Ill use the second socket, and connect to the remote host. So if the second sockets already receiving data, it needs to block as well.p  pIm not familiar with multithreading in VB6  is this a problem, or is the timers codeTickcode event always raised on the same thread as everything elsep

Negative 2280 pheres the setup for the project.p  pI have a WCF Service that is hosted on a net.tcp binding in buffered mode and ReliableSession enabled.p  pThe binding is configured to use TransportWithMessageCredential security. The certificate is a self signed certificate that I am identifying using the Thumbprint.  The UserNameValidator is a custom validator which for testing, never fails it wasnt failing before but I removed the uncertaintyp  pThe service and client are on the same machine and they both have access to the certificate.p  pThe problemp  pI am receiving a Socket Aborted exception when trying to consume a Method from the service. Here is the code I use to open a connection to the service. MonitorServiceCallbacks only contains empty methods to fulfil the requirements of the Interface.p  precode instanceContext  new InstanceContextnew MonitorServiceCallbacks  serviceInterface  new MonitorCallbackServiceClientinstanceContext   serviceInterface.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName  Environment.MachineName  serviceInterface.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password  myPassword  serviceInterface.Open codepre  pThis appears to work fine as the serviceInterface.State variable is set to State.Opened and the custom validator is called and returns without exception.p  pHowever, if I try to call a method using the serviceInterface proxy, no code that I can break into is run on the service and the tracelog reveals no errors apart from a SocketAborted exception which occurs 1 minute after receiving what appears to be the message for the method.p  pThere is no InnerException.p  pI have tried to google the issue but the results tend to say just disable security and it will work fine. Unfortunately, this cannot be done.p  pI am extremely confused by this issue and any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pMany thanks,br Ehrysp

Negative 2280 pour application is a Java webbased application which is used by a number of different organizations and which we host ourselves.p  pIm currently struggling with the described issue. In our application we have a mass printing functionality that spits out PDF files, generated by Apache FOP, which the user can then print. The problem is that sometimes some of those pages need to be printed in one printeror a tray of one printer, the second one somewhere else and the third page in the same printertray as the first one. p  pMy original intent was to use Adobe Javascript because it seems that it allows for a perpage printer selectionunfortunately no tray selection which is currently not supported. I could then solve the tray selection by selecting different printers who each have a different default tray. The last part is the problem p  pSo my question is, does someone know how, or if its possible, to create network printers with default trays This would also mean that a network printer needs to be able to have multiple IPs, each with a different setting.p  pPS When writing this, I realized it may be more of a sysadmin type of question. However, considering this problem is programming related I think its belongs here. p

But that didnt work as the GetVoteID in the javascript caused the script not to work and I dont know how to make the script reusable with onclick identifiers. p  pI see the thumbs up and down vote questions on lots of sites and the questions are dynamically reproduce though a database output, what are they doing to reuse there ajaxp  pI know onclick identifiers are the way to go, so any help on how I can convert my script, CFCs, and whatever else so that it can handle 10, 20 or 1000 questions that need a vote.p  pBelow is my code The links, cfajaxproxy, CFCs, and javascriptp  pstrongYes  No linksstrongbr     codeltCFOUTPUT QUERYGetVoteListgtbr             ltA HREFjavascript onclickGetVoteYes9GetVoteIDgtYesltAgtbr             ltA HREFjavascript onclickGetVoteNo9GetVoteIDgtNoltAgtbr     ltCFOUTPUTgtcodep  pstrongStyle for ajaxstrongbr     codeltSTYLEgtbr         GetVoteDescription9visibility  visiblebr     ltSTYLEgtcode  p  pstrongcfajaxproxystrongbr codeltcfajaxproxy cfcCFCGetVoteYes9 jsclassnameYesVote9CFCgtbr ltcfajaxproxy cfcCFCGetVoteNo9 jsclassnameNoVote9CFCgtcode p  pstrongYesVoteCFCstrong  p  precodeltcfcomponentgt     ltcffunction nameNewCount9 accessremotegt         ltCFQUERY NAMEYesCount9CK DATASOURCEMyDSNgt             SELECT               FROM    GetVote             WHERE   GetVoteID  ltcfqueryparam value9 cfsqltypeCFSQLINTEGERgt         ltCFQUERYgt         ltCFSET NewCount9YesCount9CK.YesCount1gt         ltCFQUERY NAMEUpdateYesCount DATASOURCEMyDSNgt             UPDATE  GetVote             SET     YesCount  ltcfqueryparam valueNewCount9 cfsqltypeCFSQLINTEGERgt             WHERE   GetVoteID  ltcfqueryparam value9 cfsqltypeCFSQLINTEGERgt         ltCFQUERYgt          ltcfreturn NewCount9gt     ltcffunctiongt ltcfcomponentgt codepre  pstrongNoVoteCFCstrong  p  precodeltcfcomponentgt     ltcffunction nameNewCount9 accessremotegt           ltCFQUERY NAMENoCount9CK DATASOURCEMyDSNgt               SELECT                 FROM    GetVote                WHERE   GetVoteID  ltcfqueryparam value9 cfsqltypeCFSQLINTEGERgt           ltCFQUERYgt           ltCFSET NewCount9NoCount9CK.NoCount1gt           ltCFQUERY NAMEUpdateNoCount DATASOURCEMyDSNgt               UPDATE  GetVote               SET     NoCount  ltcfqueryparam valueNewCount9 cfsqltypeCFSQLINTEGERgt               WHERE   GetVoteID  ltcfqueryparam value9 cfsqltypeCFSQLINTEGERgt           ltCFQUERYgt            ltcfreturn NewCount9gt       ltcffunctiongt  ltcfcomponentgt codepre  pstrongajax scriptstrong  p  precodeltSCRIPT TYPEtextjavascriptgt     function GetVoteNo9                   var GetVoteNo9  document.getElementByIdGetVoteNo9          var cfc  new NoCFC9               cfc.setCallbackHandlergetDataResultNo9               cfc.NewCount9true           var GetVoteDescription9  document.getElementByIdGetVoteDescription9.style.displaynone          var content  document.getElementByIdYesResponse9.innerHTML         var content  document.getElementByIdNoResponse9.innerHTMLYou voted No            function getDataResultNo9NoResult9                  var content  document.getElementByIdNoCount9.innerHTMLNoResult            function GetVoteYes9                  var GetVoteYes9  document.getElementByIdGetVoteYes9          var cfc  new YesCFC9               cfc.setCallbackHandlergetDataResultYes9               cfc.NewCount9true           var GetVoteDescription9  document.getElementByIdGetVoteDescription9.style.displaynone          var content  document.getElementByIdYesResponse9.innerHTMLYou voted Yes         var content  document.getElementByIdNoResponse9.innerHTML            function getDataResultYes9YesResult9                  var content  document.getElementByIdYesCount9.innerHTMLYesResult      ltSCRIPTgt   codepre

Negative 2280 pstrongI have a winforms checkbox that is bound to a property of an Entity Framework entity.strongp  pSo for example, I have codebindingSource.DataSource  myDogcode with a checkbox bound to the property codeIsSleepingcode, so that when the user checks the box, codeIsSleepingcode becomes true, and when the user unchecks the box, codeIsSleepingcode becomes false.p  pThis works fine.

Thus, if I want something to happen when the box is uncheckedp  precodeprivate void IsSleepingCheckboxCheckedChangedobject sender, EventArgs e      OnDogPropertyChangedmyDog     MyAnimalEntities.SaveChanges  codepre  pcodemyDog.IsSleepingcode will still be true, until the checkboxs codeValidatedcode is later raised.

Moving the code.SaveChangescode call to codeIsSleepingCheckboxValidatedcode does not solve this problem, because if the checkbox is toggled but then the form is closed without ever moving focus emawayem from the checkbox, strongthe checkbox is never validatedstrong and thus its state is never savedp  pI imagine this must be a fairly common problem with databinding and checkboxestextboxes, and indeed Ive found a ton of posts on the subject online, but no one ever seems to have a solution.  strongHas anyone been able to find a workaround for thisstrongp

Negative 2280 pIm having a problem where sometimes my code will function correctly, but other times it will fail.p  pThis is the first bit of PDH related code that I runp  precodeconst stdwstring pidWildcardPath  LProcessID Process DWORD bufferSize  0 LPTSTR paths  NULL  PDHSTATUS status  PdhExpandCounterPath     pidWildcardPath.cstr,     paths,     ampbufferSize checkPDHStatusstatus, PDHMOREDATA, LExpected request for more data. codepre  pThe result of the PdhExpandCounterPath function call is code0x800007D0code codePDHCSTATUSNOMACHINEcode.  The codecheckPDHStatuscode function is a simple function that I wrote that asserts that the status is equal to the second parameter.  In this case, I expect the result to be PDHMOREDATA because codepathscode is codeNULLcode and codebufferSizecode is code0code.  The goal of this call is to determine the size of the buffer I must allocate to store all of the results for a subsequent call to codePdhExpandCounterPathcode.  This is described in the PDH a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa37260528vVS.8529.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa under the emRemarksem section.p  pThe a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa37304628vVS.8529.aspx relnofollowlist of PDH error codesa describes codePDHMOREDATAcode as Unable to connect to the specified computer, or the computer is offline.  As you can see by the performance counter path in the code above, I am not even trying to connect to a different computer than my own.p  pIt is interesting the way that this code fails.  Sometimes it works fine and then other times, it will fail on multiple backtoback executions of my application.  I have codeinclude ltpdh.hgtcode in my header file and I have a section in my property sheet for this DLL that looks like thisp  precodeltTool     NameVCLinkerTool     AdditionalDependenciespdh.lib gt codepre  pIm not sure if it matters, but this program is built by Visual Studio 2005 and run on Windows XP.  Am I doing something incorrectlyp  hr  pIm a coworker of Daves and have discovered the following during my investigationp  pthe code above runs fine when run from a loggedin interactive session the code runs fine when initiated as a Scheduled Task AND the user is logged in at the time the scheduled task is fired off the code FAILS only when run as a Scheduled Task AND the user is NOT logged in at the time the task starts the code continues to fail if the user logs in after the failing task has started but while it is still running because it is looping endlessly until it gets a PDHMOREDATA status back. In the failing instances, the following environment variables have not been establishedset for the program APPDATA, HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH ... I dont think this is a problem. However, the failing program also lacks the SeCreateGlobalPrivilege from its token the passing programs all have this privilege in the token and PERFMON shows it as Default Enabled. The other difference is that failing program has the NTAUTHBATCH user group in the token, while the passing program has NTAUTHINTERACTIVE instead ... all other user groups and privileges are the same for both cases. I think the global privilege is coming from the interactive login, but dont know if it has any bearing on PDH operation.p  pI cannot find anything in the Performance CounterPDH documentation that talks about needing any special permissions or privileges for this functionality to succeed. Is the global privilege required to use Performance Counters p  pOr is there some other contextenvironment difference between running Scheduled Tasks as a specific user when that user isisnt logged in at the time the task starts, that would account for the PDH call succeedingfailing respectively p

Negative 2280 pI am developing an app that lets the user record videos and photos. Now I am wondering what is the best way to store them p  pThe first idea is of course to save it in the users photo library, just as if he had recorded the photo from the Camera app, and use a reference to the files. Now theres the problem that the user can access and delete files from the Photos application, which may be still needed by my app. I dont think that I can prevent the user from deleting photos, but how do I deal with the inconsistency my app will suffer frombr The other way would be to take care of the storage myself. My app already uses Core Data, so I could convert the media files using an codeNSValueTransformercode to an codeNSDatacode object and store it as BLOB in Core Data. Then there are some more questions regarding the performance. I know that an SQLitebased Core Data can perfectly handle databases of several GB in size, but loading large data objects will take some time anyway. The obvious advantage is that the user is not going to make my app inconsistent, but is the performance penalty acceptable And most of all If I use a codeUIImagePickerControllercode to capture photos and videos, it is going to save it in the library anyway. To save it in Core Data, I would have to take the photo from there, convert it to an codeNSDatacode object, save it and delete it from the library again. This does not seem to be the right way to me. Also, UIKit provides me a function to get an codeNSDatacode object from a photo via codeUIImageJPEGRepresentationcode, but there seems to be no such function for converting videos.p  pAll in all, because of all those unanswered questions, I would like to use the first approach. But the inconsistency problem puzzles me. What is the best practice to deal with itp

If we have conflicts on every line it becomes difficult and time consuming to sort out the real conflicts.

Negative 2280 pThis might seem a bit basic and something thats been asked quite a lot around here, but I have a small .htaccess problem modrewrite.p  pIm working on a MVC framework for PHP like everybody else... and all traffic goes through index.php which then routes to the required controller and method. All that goes well. The structure is roughly something like thisp  ul liapplication ol licontrollersli limodelsli liviewsli olli licacheli liframework li lipublic ol liassetsli liimgli licssli lijsli olli liindex.phpli li.htaccessli ul  pFor an URL like myapp.comcss I need o load the CSS controller, index function. But for URLs like myapp.comcssstyle.css I need to fetch the file from the publiccssdirectoryp  pId hate writing public for each file I want to include, so basically I need to redirect all traffic to public if its an actual file and keep the normal rewriting rule for all other URLs. Im planning to use this in production and it would be much easier to let frontend developers do their stuff the way they normally do it and then just copy paste stuff into place instread of going through CSS to modify paths and such. p  pI came up with thisp  precodeRewriteEngine on  RewriteRule imgcssjsassets..[az]3 public12 [L,NC]  RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . index.php1 [L,QSA] codepre  pBut it has some obvious flaws. I dont mind having to set directories in the first regex, but checking that the path is a file the way I do seems rather unreliable. Using RewriteCond to check that its a file didnt work for some reason and I think this method can fail for URLs like myapp.comimgthisisactuallyanarticle.aaa Of course, extensiuons can also be longer than 3 characters and I need to check that thats safe as well. p  pWhats the best way to go about this How do you guys ussually do it Or is this a wrong approach from the very beginingp

Negative 2280 pIm new to PHP and I was wondering how I can overcome this seemingly simple problemp  pI have a database with several tables. Of them 1 table is called orderheader. Order header has a field called orderID which is the primaryKey and is autoincremented. OrderID is used in other tables in the database foodtable, drinkstable, merchantinfo, customerinfo, etcand is unique to a particular order. p  pNow I insert data into the orderheader using the usual INSERT statement and the orderheader generates a new orderID. But now I need to retrieve the orderID I just created and use it to insert data into other tables of that database.p  pThe question is how can I do both inserting data and retrieving the resulting orderID in one atomic method I cannot use the mySQL query to get the last orderID because what if another thread has inserted an entry in orderID in the meanwhile.p  pIn Java I guess one could use locks and the word synchronized, but how would one do this in PHPp

Negative 2280 pI am playing around with a new web service and thought at the same time that I was writing some proof of concept code I would practice writing them as unit tests. So I wrote a test class that authenticates and then looks at the result a session object to see if the authentication was successful. That test is its own class and there are a couple other authentication methods that it tests. That works just fine. But now if I want to actually use that session object later in other test classes what is the best practice way of doing this. p  pI guess I could make the session object a singleton on the authentication test class. Then pull it from there. I could reauthenticate each time. Even with both of those I want to be sure the authentication test has run each time. I did fine the AfterClass annotation in the testng docs but that does not apply to classes. I think its to be used only one methods to make them run after the rest of the tests in the class have run. I cant think of a good way to do this that does not feel like a little hack. What approach would the more experienced testng users suggestp  ul liThanksli ul

Negative 2280 pIve recently seen XSSI mentioned on multiple pages, e.g. a hrefhttpgooglegruyere.appspot.compart3Web Application Exploits and Defensesap  blockquote   pBrowsers prevent pages of one domain from reading pages in other domains. But they do not prevent pages of a domain from referencing resources in other domains. In particular, they allow images to be rendered from other domains and scripts to be executed from other domains. An included script doesnt have its own security context. It runs in the security context of the page that included it. For example, if www.evil.example.com includes a script hosted on www.google.com then that script runs in the evil context not in the google context. So any user data in that script will leak.p blockquote  pI fail to see what kind of security problems this creates in practice. I understand XSS and XSRF but XSSI is a little mysterious to me. p  pCan anybody sketch an exploit based on XSSIp  pThanksp

Negative 2280 pI have an issue with meeting XHTML Strict requirements for a class assignment.

This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements  such as a style element in the body section instead of inside head  or two elements that overlap which is not allowed.p      pOne common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML documents. Due to HTMLs rules of implicitly closed elements, this error can create cascading effects.

Negative 2280 pIm working on a web app using VS 2008, .Net 3.5 and C.  Most of the projects in the solution are either classic asp.net pages with some MVC 1 in the mix, the rest is shared libraries.  The solution is one that is some 5 years old and has gone through a variety of developers working on it and clearly has some performance and architectural issues.p  pPreviously, Ive been working on the project using VS 2008 on a Win XP machine, but have just transitioned over to a new box using Win 7 Ultimate.  To do so, Ive installed VS 2008, asp.net 3.5.  To support future work on the solution Ive also installed VS 2010 and asp.net 4.0.p  pOpening the solution on the new box with VS 2008 works fine, and it builds without error.  However, when I attempt to run it with the debugger, I get the following messagep  blockquote   pThere is an error in web.config.  Please correct before proceeding.  You might rename the current web.config and add a new one.p blockquote  pI think its clear that there is some sort of environmental issue regarding web.config on the new machine, but the error message is not helpful.  Adding a new web.config is not an option as the existing one is quite long and involved too much to post here.p  pIm hoping someone has a suggestion or two about where I might look for missing elements or changed configurations that might produce such an error message.  Lacking that, Ill revisit this post and provide the web.config in the hope that will elicit further help.p

Negative 2280 pSo Im convinced that this is probably an easy answer and Im just not seeing it, but after 20 google searches and 3 days of trying to figure it out on my own, I surrender.  The xaml Im using is below.  What I need is for the two textboxes to fill all remaining space and to be equally sized.  Ive tried StackPanel, DockPanel, Grid as it is below, and even nesting each of these and nesting a UniformGrid.  Nothing seems to work, I just get 2 textboxes with whatever height I specify for MinHeight. Changing the codeGrid.Rowcode setting from Auto to  just results in the TextBoxes centering themselves and moving as the window shrinks and grows.p  precode        ltTabItem HeaderNotes NamenotesTabgt

Also,median is defined for some array A  as follows. Let B be the same array A , but sorted in nondecreasing order. Median of A is B m 1based indexing, where m equals to n div 21 . Here div is an integer division operation. So, for a sorted array with 5 elements, median is the 3rd element and for a sorted array with 6 elements, it is the 4th element.p  pSince the maximum value of N is 30.I thought of brute forcing the result could there be a better solution.p

Negative 2280 pI am working on several iOS projects which will have a good bit of shared code, so Im collecting that code in static libraries. p  pNow lets say I have 3 static libraries Im working withp  ol liLib A contains generic utility functionsli liLib B contains one set of classesli liLib C contains a second set of classesli ol  pand A is a dependency of both B and Cp  pNow, my final project needs to utilize functionality from all three libraries.

Negative 2280 pI am currently working on a project where I have to manage large sets of unique elements. Each element has 20 Properties, and every element has a public property DateTime.p  pThe property DateTime is not unique, so I cannot use a generic dictionary to store my data.p  pCurrently I put those elements into an ObservableCollection, but the perfomance of removing elements from the collection is incredibly slow, I end up waiting 20 seconds to remove 7000 elements from a collection of 25.000 elements.p  pThe search operation seems to be quite efficient, it takes only 30 ms to find 80 randomly selected elements from an unsorted collection of 300.000 elements.p  pEach element implements the GetHashCode method by simply returning the DateTime.GetHashCode.p  pI thought that using a HashSet rather than an ObservableCollection would increase my performance quite a bit, but it doesnt seem to have an effect at all...p  pAnd using a generic dictionary is even worse...p  pIsnt the HashSet more powerful than an ObservableCollection if the elements have good hash functions there are very few elements that have the same hash codep

Negative 2280 pI am trying to implement Open Graph and the Like button on my wordpress website.  I want to have the Like button positioned directly beneath a youtube video posted on one of my wordpress pages.p  pI have watched the facebook open graph video explaining the code to put onto your page, but it doesnt explain how to do it in wordpress.  I have researched several wordpress plugins that implement open graph into your site, but they all seem to take data from the site itself and automatically implement it into the open graph data.

All the child widgets on the frame will be hidden with the frame.li liWhen the user clicks on Next or Back buttons on a window, call a subroutine that hides other frames with codegridforgetcode and makes the one that is needed visible with codegridcode.li liWhen you want the program to end, use the destroy  method for the root window.li ul  pSo you will be creating a single window and showing different frames on it.p  pBy the way, the best place to start studying tkinter is a hrefhttpwww.tkdocs.comtutorialindex.html relnofollowhttpwww.tkdocs.comtutorialindex.htmlap  pHere is a sample implementation in Python3.

I could use a codeQueryCreationListenercode to intercept the query creation and get the sort parameter however, I cant actually modify the query at that point. Or, I can extend and use a custom codePageableArgumentResolvercode we are already doing this to grab the sort parameters however, I dont have access to the entity at that point, nor the ability to determine if the entity actually has a property by that name. We could declare the supported properties explicitly however, again, this defeats the idea of centrally and automatically handling this scenario without requiring specific or declared knowledge of the entities.p  pIs there any other type of interceptor or similar construct that I can utilize to centrally validate pageable sort parameters and modify if necessary before invoking the query Or is there any type of configuration or way that Spring can automatically handle this scenario such that it more gracefully handles invalid sort paramsp

Negative 2280 pIm trying to understand the use of codedup2code and codedupcode . p  pFrom the man page  p  precodeDESCRIPTION  dup and dup2 create a copy of the file descriptor oldfd. After successful return of dup or dup2, the old and new descriptors may be used interchangeably. They share locks, file position pointers and flags for example, if the file position is modified by using lseek on one of the descriptors, the position is also changed for the other.  The two descriptors do not share the closeonexec flag, however.  dup uses the lowestnumbered unused descriptor for the new descriptor.  dup2 makes newfd be the copy of oldfd, closing newfd first if necessary.    RETURN VALUE  dup and dup2 return the new descriptor, or 1 if an error occurred in which case, errno is set appropriately.   codepre  pWhy would I need that system call  what is the use of duplicating the file descriptor  p  pIf I have the file descriptor , why would I want to make a copy of it  p  pId appreciate if you could explain and give me an example where codedup2code  codedupcode is needed . p  pThanks p

Negative 2280 pI have a webservice that I am designing which pays users to complete certain tasks. For example, if a user clicks a link, they are paid, say, 0.10 to their account. A user could perform any one of these tasks up to 20 times per day. In order for the user to request the funds be paid to them, they must have an account balance of 5. p  pIm trying to decide the best way to keep track of the transactions and accounts. My design currently looks as followsp  precodeAccounts   accountid  memberid  balance     1           1          497.8500   System Account  2           5          2.1500     Transactions   transactionid  accountid  typeid  taskid  date  amount    1               1           Debit    1        date  1.10    2               2           Credit   1        date  1.10     3               1           Debit    1        date  1.05    4               2           Credit   1        date  1.05    codepre  pThis design is based off the accounting principals for doubleentry. Now my dilemma is technically the user isnt paid this money until they have requested a Payout. A Payout consists of the user submitting a request, the request being approved, the money being deducted from their account balance and sent to them via PayPal. So my question is, is it a good idea to actually deduct the amounts from the system balance if the user has not requested a payout yet The money in their account can be used to fund additional things on the site, it also expires after 30 days of inactivity. p  pMy idea was to keep the transaction table as it is and design another table called payouts with the following structurep  precodePayouts   payoutid  accountid  date  amount    1          2           date  2.00   codepre  pBut then how do I reflect the payout in the transactions table It seems incomplete. p  pShould I separate the tasks from the transactions table and only enter a transaction record if the user has requested the payout Im not sure if I would lose auditing abilities by doing it that way.p  pDoes anyone have some insightp

Negative 2280 pMy task at the moment is to port a driver for some 16550compatible chip from QNX to Linux. The chip provides several UARTs, each one seen as a standard 16550 serial port, albeit with some extensions.p  pNow, in QNX, the whole device driver is packed into a standalone executable, that acts both as a driver and as an initial configurator for the provided UARTs baud rates, loopback modes etc. That is just natural in QNX because there device drivers run in user space and are little more than standard executables.p  pOn Linux, OTOH, the driver is now implemented as a kernel module, loadable at will. More, that module is provided by the producer, so I would not want to modify or patch it too much.p  pFor me, the remaining task is to provide some mechanism for setting up those UARTs parameters. They are seen as devttyPREFIXX devices. I intend to do that through a standard Cprogrammed executable calling standard termios ie tcsetattr or ioctls on the serial ports of interest.p  pWhich leads me to the question is my approach right And, if yes, then how to achieve a persistent configuration As I perceive the fact from this example a hrefhttpwww.easysw.commikeserialserial.html relnofollowhttpwww.easysw.commikeserialserial.htmla, the termios functions act on OPEN devices. In short they open a device, they set up the parameters, they read or write, then close the port. After closing the port, is the configuration baud rate etc. lost I hope it is not, because it is stored, already, into the hardware.p  pCan somebodey confirm to me that the configuration is persistent And, if not, how to achieve that persistence, for the future applications that would open again that port and will expect it with some preestablished parameters If not, should I modify the module kernel to accept some parameters and, then, do the configuration at the load timep  pThe approach that I intend for now is to write that C executable that opens the ports, sets up their configuration, then close the ports. I hope the latter applications will see the ports with the desired configuration.p  pThank you.p

Negative 2280 pOn one of my sites, I have a problem with too many NEW users not reading the rules and posting their phone numbers in public, which is against the rules.p  pSo to put an end to this, I want to check whether a phone number has been submitted before making the post live.  What is the best and most efficient way to determine whether a phone number appears in a stringp  pHeres my thought process on thisp  p1 Phone numbers are at least 10 digits.p  p2 Sometimes users use codecode, codecode, codecode, and spaces within their phone numbers.p  pSo, to check whether a phone number has been posted, it seems like I would have to get the string of the post, remove all of the characters from code2code above, and then search for any occurrence of 10 consecutive digits or more.p  pOf course, this could be circumvented, but the vast majority of new users arent trying to circumvent the rules, they are just posting their phone numbers completely oblivious to the rules and I dont know how else to stop them so that I dont have to waste so much time moderating the site.p  pHow would I do the above in PHP  Or is there a better wayp  pstrongEditstrong  To clarify, my site already has a report post button for users to report offending posts, which is how I moderate the site, but 90 of my of my moderation time is spent having to edit out phone numbers and warn those users not to do it. I want to preempt the problem so to speak by catching it before it happens, and warning the user about the rules. Sure, users can circumvent it, but then Ill just ban them since they were specifically warned not to do it, and I cant fathom many users knowingly ignoring the rules just to get banned. So my solution would save me A LOT of time, with minimal drawbacks. I just cant fathom many cases on my site where 10 or more consecutive digits are entered that arent phone numbers, so Im not worried about false positives.p

Negative 2280 pIve noticed that Java String will reuse char array inside it to avoid creating new char array for a new String instance in method such as subString. There are several unpublish constructors in String for this purpose, accepting a char array and two int as range to construct a String instance. p  pBut until today I found that split will also reuse the char arr of original String instance. Now I read a loooooong line from a file, split it with ,  and cut a very limit column for real usage. Because every part of the line secretly holding the reference of the looooong char array, I got an OOO very soon. p  phere is example codep  precodeArrayListltStringgt test  new ArrayListltStringgt3000000 BufferedReader origReader  new BufferedReadernew FileReadernew File         Gfilewithlongline.txt String line  origReader.readLine int i  0 while line  origReader.readLine  null      String name  line.split,[0]     test.addname     i     if i  100000  0          System.out.printlnname       System.out.printlntest.size codepre  pIs there any standard method in JDK to make sure that every String instance that spitted is a real deep copy not shallow copyp  pNow I am using a very ugly workaround to force creating a new String instance p  precodeArrayListltStringgt test  new ArrayListltStringgt3000000 BufferedReader origReader  new BufferedReadernew FileReadernew File         Gfilewithlongline.txt String line  origReader.readLine int i  0 while line  origReader.readLine  null      String name  line.split,[0]  .trim  force creating a String instance     test.addname     i     if i  100000  0          System.out.printlnname       System.out.printlntest.size codepre

Negative 2280 pI am looking for a way in Jackson to allow serialization of a relationship depending on the root element.  For example, I have a relationship that is not a true parentchild.  Both entities can be queried.p  precodeAddress      JsonBackReference     Company company     String line1     String city     String state     String zip     String country   Company      Address mainAddress      ListltAddressgt locations     String name  codepre  pThe JsonBackReference makes it so there is no circular reference when serializing to json.  However, this also causes me to not know the company of an address.  If I am listing companies then the addresses come back and everything is good.

Negative 2280 pCurrently Ive got a content type in Drupal that is a list of fields that must be filled out. To then sort that content and display it, I have a View created that imports all the fields from that content type and filters by published and node type. p  pThis view has a URL and an argument set up that filters those results based on one of the content fields, not taxonomy. For example, I am declaring whether these records are current or past and the argument is set, now, so that if a user types URLcurrent or URLpast they will see the view display the respective content, be it past or current. p  pMy objective here is to create a panel that will display this view in one pane and on the left hand pane, have a navigation list with links to URLpast URLcurrent etc. which will link to the same panel page only with an argument. This argument can then be passed down to the view, changing it respectively. p  pIs this possible if so, how I have worked on this issue for several days and the resources I come across are all several years old and nonhelpful. Thank you. p

I read a few pages of the apache axis2 manual but its everything else but nicetouse, and anyway in C.p  pAnother question in my specific case is Isnt it easier to send just send some textual numbers plus parameters to identify the procedures to call and reply in textual form, as I know the signature of the called proceduresp  pstrongEdit2strong As SOAP is just a standard and RPC is just curious, Imagined something like function pointers over IP D ,imho none of them all is a solution.

Then when I scroll down and then scroll back up to see it again, it will be truncated. Specifically, the row size will be fine but the label height will change and become truncated to 2 lines only.

Wondering if its some reverse of the above potential answer.  p  ul liempotential answerem is that the rows are all calculated and stored up front so that scrolling downthen back up doesnt affect it.

Negative 2280 pI am creating a button for my application that, when pressed shows an indention looking effect to make it appear that the user is clicking a real button. It is very simple, using only an image for the default state and the depressed one for the highlighted state. Im having a few problems. The quality is terrible. I have uploaded the images to XCode in the exact pixels they will be presented in my application but when I export it from Illustrator it gets really pixelated. So I was wondering if there was a way for me to upload an image a few times bigger than my button and have it shrink to fit the button size. Ive tried to do that but when I run my app it gets really messed up and weird looking. I would just put text inside the button but then it ruins the pressed effect. Any ideasp

Negative 2280 pIt seems like this should be easy to figure out, but I havent had any luck this afternoon.

The tabs would switch between the two table view controllers.p  pRight now, the view controller with the buttons acts as a sort of menu. Each button leads to one of the table view controllers. Ideally this view controller would emnotem have the tab bar visible, and would only be reachable from back buttons on the nav bars of the table view controllers.p  pIve tried a few different ways of embedding into a tabbarcontrollers but none of them produce the desired result p  pIve tried selecting both table view controllers and embedding those in a tab view controller. The tabbar doesnt show up in simulator, and the unreachable scene warning appears.p  pIve tried embedding the initial nav controller into a tabbarcontroller. This creates a tab entry for the first menu page. It also causes issues with push segues once I connect the tableviews to the tabview.p  pI would be fine implementing some programmatic options on top of the storyboard, I just chose storyboarding for this project since its a relatively simple presentation of data.p  pWhat is the proper way of going about this Thanks p  pimg srchttpi3.photobucket.comalbumsy87MrBluesBreakerScreenShot20130109at144749PMzpse3189a6d.png altStoryboard Screenshotp

Negative 2280 pI have a XSL template that uses a miniaturized javascript file J1. It can be assumed that J1 is impossible to trace and reverse engineer. p  pThe problem I have is that there is a slightly more updated version of J1 called J1a and I am interested to use J1 for some parts of the code and J1a for other parts of the code in the same template. Obviously, including both in the same file will be problematic due to duplicate classes and functions. Ive tried to no avail to wrap either J1 or J1a into a pseudonamespace Javascript does not support namespaces or modules with the following codep  precodefunction mynamespace    this.container      insert monstrous javascript blob      which then is expected to do sth like mynamespace.Container.SomeFunction codepre  pIve also tried a dirty refactor by just manually renaming a gazillion names which is very errorprone, but neither approach work.p  pDuring the writing of this post, Ive thought of a third approach, which is to add a function X in J1 and a function Y in J1a and then delegate my tasks to those wrapper functions which should solve the problem due to the fact that J1 and J1a do not import each other. However, Ive not tested this and I am not an experienced javascript writer.p  pEditp  pSince all I really need from J1 and J1a is the followingp  precodeMyObject.SomeStaticMethod MyObject obj  new MyObjectargs obj.SomeInstanceMethod codepre  pthen maybe I can dop  precode function Xvar args       MyObject.SomeStaticMethod      MyObject obj  new MyObjectargs      obj.SomeInstanceMethod    function Yvar args       MyObject.SomeStaticMethod      MyObject obj  new MyObjectargs      obj.SomeInstanceMethod   codepre  pand add X to J1 and Y to J1a and then call X and Y selectively in the XSL templatep  pEdit 2 It turns out the giant miniaturized javascript blob does not contain conventional global variables, but something thats about as bad  variables tethered to the windows object. p  pWith that said, is there any way to somehow split the rendering of the HTML so that one part only has one copy in the global scope and another part has the other copy in the global scope Ive heard theres some tile approach with JSP.

Ultimately, Id like to decode the JSON and iterate through it so that I can INSERT the data into a Sqlite database on the client.

Negative 2280 pIm working on implementing GZIP compression for interactions between some of our systems. The systems are written in both Java and C, so GZIP streams were used on both sides since they have standard library support.p  pOn the C side, everything works up to and including our biggest test files 70MB uncompressed, however we run into issues with Java running out of heap space. Weve tried increasing the heap size to capacity for the IDE, but the issue is still not resolved.p  pIve taken some steps to try and optimize the Java code, but nothing seems to keep the data from piling up in the heap.

Negative 2280 pI am trying to build a little web application with Ruby on Rails. Its a simple tool to track stocks that people are interested in.p  pFor the stock data I am using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comtyrauberstockquote relnofollowstockquote gema. p  pCurrently, I have a model with a single field, ticker. Here people would enter the ticker symbol of the stock theyre interested in watching. I want to be able to populate a table of information based on the ticker when the user logs in full company name, price etc. When I test my current method, I get a  uninitialized constant TargetStockQuote error. However, when I call my methods getcurrentprice or getcompanyname in the console, they work perfectly. I know I need to keep my views dumb, but Im not sure how to make it more simple than this and have them work properly.p  pI would like to be able to populate my dashboard table with information on the stocks users are watching. Given that the model stores the ticker i.e. AAPL, I need to somehow input the ticker into a series of methods in the model that pull the proper data from the stockquote API and return the result to my HTML table. p  pThanks for the helpp  pa hrefhttppastebin.comdJ2xWd5G relnofollowFull stacktraceap  pstrongstock.rbstrongp  precodeclass Stock lt ActiveRecordBase   attraccessible ticker  def getcompanynameticker   companyname  StockQuoteStock.quoteticker.company end  def getcurrentpriceticker   companyname  StockQuoteStock.quoteticker.last end end  codepre  pstrongstockscontroller.rbstrongp  precodeclass StocksController lt ApplicationController   def dashboard   stocks  Stock.all  end   end codepre  pstrongdashboard.html.erbstrongp  precodelttbodygt     lt stocks.each do stock gt     lttrgt         lttdgtlt stock.getcompanynamestock.ticker gtlttdgt         lttdgtlt stock.stock gtlttdgt         lttdgtlt buttonto Delete, edittargetpath, class gt btn btnsmall btndanger gt lttdgt     lttrgt     lt end gt  lttbodygt codepre
Negative 2280 pI want to make an app that will be deployed on both the App Store and Google Play. It involves sending data to a server, so I decided to try Google App Engine. I have looked at Googles Tic tac toe service, but Im not sure its what I want. Basically, what I want to do is to be able to send data to the server using a bundled codeEntitycode, and to be able to read it back. Does the codeEndpointscode service fulfill this need, and if not, where would I find something that doesp  pThanks.p
Negative 2280 pI know Its not supported, unlike in php. Let me draft my system.p  pIts a 2D scrolling game, with object Cloud, Star, Bird, with a common, BaseItem class. Different things can happen on collision with them, getting more life, losing a life... etc. An abstract method, BaseItem.eventOnCollation would only return an array describing what changed got a life, lost a life, got a bonus etc.p  pSo far so good, but there is another CloudB with the same effect as Cloud. Copy exactly the eventOnCollation method Code repetition. Instatinize Cloud and call its eventOnLocation Better, but the instatize loads more, unnecessary things. I just want to know what the effect is on collate.p  pThats when I said lets use static  its not even needed to have an instance of an object to know its effect  there can be 100 Stars with the same effect. The objects are in a Vector. And this is when I iterate all object, and would call the eventOnCollation  exceptionp  pI hope it was all clearp

Negative 2280 pIm trying to debug the popular cannot call method addClass of undefined of jQuery slider in range mode, and finding some strange things. Some people say this error is due to values being passed in as strings instead of integers, but my values are verified integers and Im out of ideas, so I went to try and debug jQuery UI, hitting a dead end instantly.p  pSee image img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWtZTB.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, when I expand the options object in the dev tools, options.values is an array of two NaNs. However, if I console.logoptions.values I get the real array, as it should be, with proper numeric values. Whats worse, when I log them directly with console.logoptions.values[0] for example, I get the proper value.p  pHowever, when slider requests the values, it always gets NaN back  this is apparent when calculating the closestHandle for the range slider  the NaN is so toxic it poisons the entire loop and returns an undefined closestHandle, thus causing the aforementioned addClass error.p  pWhy does the situation from the image happen Why can it happen Apparently two identical properties contain different values depending on the way of accessing them.p

The integration works fine. Even better than fine, really. I love it.p  pWhat I really need though, is little more complex filter than the default one that datatables comes with.

Then I want another button that would refresh and reload the datatable and cancel out any initial data it was sending as if you refreshed the page, without actually.p  pIm not very experienced with javascript, so simple solutions are the best, but any help would be very much appreciated.p
Negative 2280 pI asked the following question below and I found a very close answer but later realised it doesnt work. I am using pipe in perl. But before I even hit my condition through the pipe, the function is completed its run. Is there a way to check at runtime at the very exact second to stop the process once 10 bananas passp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17739158parseoutputandcountnumberoftimesastringappears17745830comment2587984817745830parse output and count number of times a string appearsap  pHello I tried this...but it doesnt work...the process is finished way before I even get the chance to stop it. Isnt there anything which can actually control the flow of process with the pid. I mean, 23 bananas had crossed before it found that 10 were done. I am guessing pipe flows slower than the actual processp  pAll I want to do is add a delay in the already running process. Like lets say we know what the output will look like command 1 out command 2 out banana Now I can parse for banana and put a delay of 5 seconds in the process. Once I inject a delay, I could run my perl script in that time and stop the script in time.p  pTo make my question clear the code I wrotep  precodemy pid  open my pipe, , commandA  tee banana.foo      or die Error opening pipe from commandA n   open my pipe, commandA  tee result      or die Error opening pipe from commandA n   print pidn   my n  0   while ltpipegt      n if banana     last if n gt 0     print pipestringn      kill INT, pid   close pipe   kills the command with SIGPIPE if its not done yet    if n eq 1      print commandA printed bananan      else        print nothing happenedn     banana.foo  actual result      banana.foo expected result one                              one two                              two  three                            three  banana                           banana four five codepre  pSo I dont want the last 2 values and want the program to stop. commandA is p  precodeecho one echo two echo three echo banana echo four echo five codepre  pIMPORTANT EDIT I think what I would be going towards is creating a debugger. Someone has the code for any open source debugger or something else which controls processes.p

I know I can refer to static final variables inside the codeValueEventListenercode, but I dont see how this will help me since I dont know how many Tables or Rows Ill be dealing with at runtime. p  pSo, in short, how can I link a particular call to the codeValueEventListenercode with the codeTableRowcode its data is associated withp  pNow for question 2, which is a bit more codeFirebasecode specific....p  ol liIt seems like codeValueEventListenercode is called once when the activity is loaded, and then again for any changes to the underlying data. But I only want it called for changes to underlying data, not on loading. Am I using the wrong EventListener Or is there some way to avoid this behaviorli ol

Negative 2280 pIn a Django project I have a space in the templates to show the messages coming from the Django messages framework. I would like to use that framework to show some messages that are not triggered by user actions in some views but instead are set by an app. Ideally my app will decide when it is best to send the messages but initially it will be random. An example to clarify a bit I dont want to send the typical message related to an action like you have successfully updated your profile. Instead I would like to recommend some content from times to times, something like you might be interested by spam. The content spam in this case is provided by some objects in the database that another app gathers already. p  pI was wondering how I can set a message outside of the typical view. I was thinking about implementing a middleware that would be called on every request and setting the message in the processrequest class if this particular user has been marked to receive any.p  pIs it the even a good idea to begin withp

Negative 2280 pIt seems from my initial reading there are two options for assembly on Mac OS X.    C libraries    BSD System Calls.   Something with Objective Cp  pIs there an equivalent of the Win32 API on Mac OS X p  pApple uses Objective C heavily how much does Objective C add on that changes using it in assemblyp  pApples CoreFoundation seems to be abandoned or not heavily used instead Apple choosing to go with Objective C and not regular C libraries.p  pMac OS X seems to use the NASM assembler.p  pThis is all coming from someone who has most of their experience in MASM and the Win32 API. I hope I am horribly informed here as it seems right now assembly on the Mac is bleak.p

Negative 2280 pI have created an entity named codeImagecode. It holds image metadata etc that I save in the database. Currently I have an codeonetomanycode relationship between codeQuestioncode and codeImagecode. So I have declared codeOneToManycode and codeJoinColumncode annotation on the list of images in question entity. This means there is an foreign key in the image table named codequestionidcode in my case.p  pI want to use this entity in other relationships too. codeUsercode could have images and so on. However, this would mean that I need a codeuseridcode column in the image table too. As this grows this seems like a bad approach.p  pHow can I do this Do I need to use inheritance and create subclasses like codeQuestionImagecode, codeUserImagecode and so onp  pOr are there other better and simpler waysp
Negative 2280 pToday I was going to pack my game into a Jar to provide to a friend who codes and wanted to see a nice glitch I managed to create. When I went to make it a Runnable jar it would load up in the Command Prompt but throw Resource Not Found errors for Sounds .oggs, which was fine because they werent going to be used in the Debug mode it was set to. Then it threw a NullPointerException in TileHanlder.class at initTileMap line 137.p  pI am at a loss so I came to StackOverflow because I have spent nearly my entire day on getting a working Jar. I have also tried JarSplice.p  pMy main question is if there is any anomalies you notice or something I didnt do that is leading to resources not being found in the .jar. p  pALL CODE AND RESOURCES

Negative 2280 pThe relevant part of my app consist of 2 views view1 and view2, 1 operation OP1 a singleton object sObj, 1 queue and 1 BOOL. The singleton holds the queue reference and exposes OP1.p  pIn view1 I start a OP1 async it retrieves items for view2. I dispatch OP1 to the queue handled by sObj on view1 the user fills the rest of the form and press next, push view2, view2 gets the sObj reference and checks if the operation completed, if yes, it fetches the results and display, if not, it goes to a loop checking the property OP1Completed.p  pIf the user is slow when choosing the options, theres a big chance that OP1 will complete before view2 is pushed, which is fine, and works perfectly BUT if the user uses the defaults, theres a 99 chance that he will hit next before OP1 completed, which SHOULD be fine, but its not.p  pChecking logs and debugging I noticed that the async block running on the queue just stops running when view2 is pushed... and because of that OP1Completed flag is never set and then everything else on breaks...p  pcan anyone help im lost herep

Negative 2280 pIm creating an app using phonegap that pulls the majority of its content from a database. It has a few hundred pages so I thought the best option would be to use a single page solution and just keep loading content into the main div when needed. I have tried using Handlebars to do this but Im not sure if that was the best solution as I cant get jquery mobile working with it the app needs lots of accordions. Have also tried creating my own very simple accordions but failed dismally to even get an onlcick event working within the handlebars script tags. Can anyone recommend a build that would be good for this job please Or guide me to some example solutions that are along these lines I have googled extensively for 2 days now and have tried quite a few suggestions out but no success so decided to post here.

Negative 2280 pId like to add some accessibility features to my Access forms, for users that have difficulty with the standard 11ptfont, whitebackground, blacktext setup.p  pWindows itself has a bunch of Display Settings options for altering window font sizes, background colours etc, but these dont cover Access forms altogether well  theyll change the colour of items where system colours are used, but font face or size of labels, input boxes, data grids etc cant be changed this way as theyre not connected to those settings. The Datasheet settings under File  Options seem to have no effect on datasheet forms or subforms.p  pI cant find any accessibility options in Access, not so much as a Zoom function 1998 called, it wants its GUI back, etc etc. It seems ridiculously excessive to have to fire up the VBA editor and do something likep  precodePublic Sub AccessbilityBtnClick     Me.Detail.BackColor  RGBwhatever      Me.HeadingLbl.FontSize  18     Me.HeadingLbl.Width  whatever accomodates bigger text     Me.HeadingLbl.Height  whatever accomodates bigger text     Me.FieldLabel1.FontSize  14     Me.FieldLabel1.Width  whatever accomodates bigger text     Me.FieldInput1.Width  whatever accomodates bigger text      ... to infinity and beyond ... End Sub codepre  pOr to craft codeFormNameBigTextcode versions of every single form and replicate the entire behaivour of my entire system.p  pSo, does Access have accessibility options If so, where are they And can they be called from VBA If not, how can accessibility options be implemented into Access formsp

Negative 2280 pI am doing some diving into the object oriented world and trying to apply the principles of how the authors of the book Clean Code think a rich object should be constructed.p  pHowever, I have run into a somewhat philosophical problem now and I am not too sure about how to deal with representation of an object.p  pIn the book Clean Code you can read that a rich object should only expose behaviors and never its internal variables. This statement has other sources as well. p  pBut if you only expose behaviors, how do you then show a representation of the object in a GUI, if you cant reach the values of the internal variables p  pExamplep  precodepublic class Todo       private final TodoID id     private final String createdBy     private final String currentOwner     private final String description     private final Status status      private TodoString createdBy, DateTime creationDate, String description, Status status, String todoName          this.id  new TodoIDcreationDate, todoName         this.createdBy  createdBy                 this.currentOwner  createdBy         this.description  description         this.status  status            public void startWorkingString name         ifStatus.INPROGRESS gt this.status          Set status to INPROGRESS          Set current owner to name              else            throw new RuntimeExceptionthis.currentOwner   has already started working on this task or it might be finished already.           public static TodoID createTodoValues values          Todo todo  new Todovalues.createdBy,                               values.creationDate,                               values.description,                               values.status,                               values.todoName          Operations to save the Todoinstance in a database         return todo.id        codepre  pI might have a method on my Todoaggregate root that returns a list of all new Todos codepublic ListltTodogt listAllNewTodoscode. All the Todos in the list have ids that represents the object. But how do I make a representation of the ids if an object is only allowed to expose behaviorsp  pstrongEDITstrong Right after posting this question I got a revelation. The book Clean Code also talks about that there is another type of structure in OOP. Not only objects with behaviors, but also data structures.  In this case I should probably view the Todoclassinstances as objects and the TodoIDinstances as data structures that exposes its internal variables. And thanks to that I CAN represent the Todo, with the TodoIDvariables, in a GUI.p

Negative 2280 pConsider three IP networks A, B and C. Host HA in networks A sends messages each containing 180 bytes of application data to a host HC in network C. The TCP layer prefixes a 20 byte header to the message. This passes through an intermediate network B.p  pthe maximum packet size, including 20 byte IP header, in each network is A  1000 bytes B  100 bytes C  1000 bytes The network A and B are connected through a 1 Mbps link, while B and C are connected by a 512 Kbps link bps  bits per second.p  precode    Q. Assuming that the packets are correctly delivered,  how many bytes, including headers, are delivered to the IP layer  at the destination for one application message, in the best case  Consider only data packets.      a 200     b 220     c 240     d 260 codepre  pI came across many solution to this problem they are not considering eathernet header or something else at data link layer.A similar solution is given below p  pD Data from network A  180 bytes application data  20 bytes TCP header  20 bytes IP header. IP header will get stripped off in network B. Thus, B will split 180  20 bytes  200 bytes of data in 3 segments, viz. 80  80  40 to allow room for 20 bytes IP header. Thus, total IP header overhead  20  3 bytes  60 bytes. Total data to be delivered to network C  80  80  40  60 bytes  260 bytes.p

Negative 2280 pI am currently trying to write a Java program that solves this.p  pAnother way to generalize the twothread Peterson lock is to arrange a number of 2thread Peterson locks in a binary tree. Suppose n is a power of two. Each thread is assigned a leaf lock which it shares with one other thread. Each lock treats one thread as thread 0 and the other as thread 1.p  pI feel like I have solved it, but my output is not always correct. I suspect my problem is in the for loop in my lock method that calls a verified Peterson lock Peterson lock has no errors in that it was provided to solve this problem.

Negative 2280 pHey everyone so having a little trouble trying to accomplish this. I understand how to add lives and display them through a Dynamic Text Field on the stage. My game is set up right now to where this happens and whenever the player dies a live decrements so it works fine. p  pBut I want to display and Image of all 3 lives a custom Movie Clip that I drew in Flash CS6 to represent the lives. So All 3 lives will be displayed in the game and once the player dies one of the lives images is removed. p  pI have some idea on what to do. For instance I created a for loop to display all 3 images on the screen and created variables to place them horizontally next to each other with a space of 30 pixels. p  pBut Im not sure if this is the correct way to approach this. Also kind of confused on how I would remove one of the images when the player diesp  pHer is my code so farp  precode    public var playerLivesmcPlayerLives     private var nLivesNumber  3     private var startPointPoint     private var aPlayerLivesArrayArray codepre  pIn my main class Engine p  precodeaPlayerLivesArray  new Array addPlayerLivesToStage codepre  pThen the addplayerlivestostage functionp  precodepublic function addPlayerLivesToStagevoid               var startPointPoint  new Pointstage.stageWidth  2  300, stage.stageHeight  2  200         var xSpacingNumber  30          for var i  0 i lt nLives i                        traceaPlayerLivesArray.length              playerLives  new mcPlayerLives              stage.addChildplayerLives              playerLives.x  startPoint.x  xSpacing  i              playerLives.y  startPoint.y              aPlayerLivesArray.pushplayerLives                codepre  pSo like i stated above everything works fine and it does display the 3 images that represent the lives, but would this be the correct approach or is there an easier method p

Negative 2280 pIve got an issue with Doctrine being somehow nasty with automagical tracking of entities and changes. Ive got a codeUserManagercode which gets data for a new user from a form and sends the data to the backend which creates the corresponding database entries. As the backend is only inserting some basic data like username, I want to persist everything else like a collection of user roles given through the form.p  pSo my method should look like thisp  precodepublic function createUser user      thisgtcreateUserInBackenduser     thisgtemgtmergeuser     thisgtemgtpersistuser     thisgtemgtflush  codepre  pMy issue now is that Doctrine either drops the data from the given codeusercode and replaces it with the database content. This way I lose the chosen user roles. Without the codemergecode Doctrine tries an codeINSERTcode which is clearly not what I want.p  pI tried everything coming to my mind from fetching a managed copy before the merge, cloning or whatever. In all cases the objects are linked so I lose the data from the form although their splobjecthash differ.p  pSome more simplified details as requestedp  precodeclass User       Username is tracked by backend     private username       Fullname is only tracked by frontendDoctrine     private fullname  codepre  pVariant 1p  precodepublic function createUser user       The user entity gets passed to the backend, which does some stuff      and also inserts the entity in the database.     thisgtcreateUserInBackenduser      The entitiy is in the database, but not managed by the EM.      Therefore Doctrine does an INSERT.     thisgtemgtpersistuser     thisgtemgtflush  codepre  pVariant 2p  precodepublic function createUser user       The user entity gets passed to the backend, which does some stuff      and also inserts the entity in the database.     thisgtcreateUserInBackenduser      Now theres an entity in the db with ID and username, but not the fullname      user  thisgtemgtmergeuser      The merge finds the entry in the database and refreshes its data.      This leads to usergtfullname which was given in the form to be emptied.      thisgtemgtpersistuser     thisgtemgtflush  codepre  pI also tried to put the return value from codemergecode into an codeotherUsercode variable, but the objects are linked and codefullnamecode still gets dropped.p  pId just need something to tell Doctrine that the new entity is managed, but it should not touch its data.

Negative 2280 pWhen exporting a multipage report from SQL Server 2008 Reporting Services to Excel, by default, pages in the report created by a page break are sent to separate worksheets in the Excel file.p  pWhile this is fine most of the time  sometimes its not.

Negative 2280 pI am in the process of taking screenshots for an app I developed, but I am having a lot of problems trying to figure out how to show more options than the default ShareMediaTask options in the WP8 emulator. Is there a way to do this Id like to be able to show something like Twitter as well, exactly as how it would look on the device. I can use my device only for a few languages supported since I purchased it in the United States, but some languages I require are not supported. Therefore, my ShareMediaTask screenshot on the screen where you choose your share option in the emulator can display all languages with no social network or on my device I can show the social network option but only with a few languages. Is there ANY way to either add an account to the emulator for screenshot purposes or add more display languages to my developer unlocked devicep

Negative 2280 pI am working with a SQLite database in my application.  The app is supposed to select a specified set of question IDs, in a random order.  I also want to limit the questions to JUST the 21 IDs I specified.  However, whenever I run the application, I am able to answer a 22nd question.  I have 2 issues.  p  ol lipI dont think my sql query is selecting the right question IDs as specified in the statement. pli lipAfter the 21st question is answered, the application should stop and not allow any further test material to be viewed.

Negative 2280 pIm working with a large dataset of human gene expression values throughout the full x, y, z MRI coordinates of the brain. Since there are 60,000 genes in the human genome, and the researchers looked for the expression values of each gene in each of 1000 samples that were taken, I need a way of storing a large number of columns in a database. p  pI am currently using a Node Module called pg for Postgresql with express, and I have 2 of my 3 tables set up already tables 1 and 3 below. However for the second data set 60,000 is more than the number of columns that can be used in such a DB. I have considered using each gene represented by a probe ID as an entry in the table, and each of the 1000 samples as columns, but I would have to create names for the columns with dynamicallyassigned identifiers. In addition, using the genes as columns and the samples as entries seems to be the more logical way to organize the data.p  pWould a keyvalue store or a NoSql DB such as Mongo provide me with the ability to store more columns 60,000  one for each genes expression as properties of a sample schemaJSON object p  pThe available data consists ofp  ol liThe Probes.csv file, which lists each Microarray probes details such as its corresponding genes name and the unique ID value for that gene which I plan to use simply to map a text input of the genes name, to the probe ID that is used in the other CSV files.li liThe ExprVals.csv file, which lists the expression values for each probe, currently listed with probe IDs as rows, and expression values as columns. These columns are ordered to match the order of the rows in the next file, which lists the coordinates of each sample for which the expression value was taken. Above I mentioned that I would like to flip this table, so that the rows correspond to samples from the next file, and columns correspond to each probe ID, but Ive not done this yet.li liThe Samples.csv file, which lists each sample with a unique sample ID, and the voxel coordinates of that sample, ordered to match the order of the columns in ExprVals.csv.li ol  pThus, the queries that I would like to be able to make arep  ol liA query of the Probes.csv table with a gene name, to get the ID values of the probes that correspond to it.li liA query of the ExprVals.csv table with a probe ID, to get the list of expression values for that probe.li liA query of the Samples.csv file for each listed expression value in the previous query, that returns the voxel coordinates of that that sample.li ol  pThe end goal of this process is to be able to input a genes name and get out a list of expression values for each voxel.p

Negative 2280 pI have a spreadsheet in Google Docs. It has two sheets projectList and projectListCompleted. When I change the contents of a specific column to Completed the code I have moves that ROW from projectList to projectListCompleted. If I go to the Completed sheet and change that same column to ANYTHING ELSE then it moves that ROW back to my Working Projects sheet. Well, I am trying to make the code a little more robust. I am creating a function called projectMover and I want to call it and tell it was action to do... Completed, Cancelled, Active, etc. and have it make decisions based on that.p  pThe code I use to move a project i.e., an Active ROW from one sheet to another is herep  precodefunction moveToNewSheet myActiveSpreadsheet, myActiveSheet, myActiveRange, myTargetSheet     var row  myActiveRange.getRow   var numColumns  myActiveSheet.getLastColumn   var targetSheet  myActiveSpreadsheet.getSheetByName myTargetSheet    var target  targetSheet.getRangetargetSheet.getLastRow  1, 1   myActiveSheet.getRangerow, 1, 1, numColumns.moveTotarget   myActiveSheet.deleteRowrow    targetSheet.sort1   return target  codepre  pThis code works great. No problems.p  pBut Im starting on my projectMover function and hitting glitches because I dont understand the API as well as I would like. What I am trying to do is have projectMover call the moveToNewSheet code. This code passes back what SHOULD BE the RANGE of the moved project. I want to access COLUMN G in that range and insert the current date so that projects have a completed date. However, as you can see in my code I am not quite grasping how to access that cell.p  pAnyone have any ideasp  precodefunction projectMover myActiveSpreadsheet, myActiveSheet, myActiveRange, myAction      switch  myAction         case Completed       var myTarget  moveToNewSheet myActiveSpreadsheet, myActiveSheet, myActiveRange, projectListCompleted        var targetCell  myTarget.getCell1,7       targetCell.activate       targetCell.setValue test        break     default       break        get targetSheet and sort it  codepre

Negative 2280 pI understand that when writing an AngularJS directive that you can bind a function in the parent scope to the directive scope by using amp in the directive scope like sop  precode... scope      functionNameInDirectiveScope ampattributeName  ... codepre  pAs part of a larger directive, what I am wanting to do is pass an unknown number of functions defined on the parent scope to a directive, as the functions to execute on ngclick of a button. For example using this HTMLp  precode... ltmyDirective button1function1 button2function2 ... gt ... codepre  pAnd have the output of the directive to be something likep  precode... ltbutton ngclickfunction1 gt ltbutton ngclickfunction2 gt ... codepre  pWhere clicking the buttons will actually run the parent scope functions.p  pI have figured out how to loop through the attributes and get the names of the functions, I just need to be able to get them bound to the ngclick attributes of the buttons.p  pIt seems like what I want is to be able to manually, in the link function of the directive, be able to do the function binding that the amp does in the scope part of a directive definition.p  pI hope this makes sense. Please ask if I didnt explain anything well enough, and thanks for your help.p

Negative 2280 pI have two domains that are closely related to each other. Because of this Im putting a fixed box on the top right corner of the page so that users can quickly jump between the two sites. However I would like to add a page transition to this action so that when the user clicks the link in the box the site will gracefully transition to the new URL. p  pI know you can do this with internal pages via JQuery Mobile  a hrefhttpdemos.jquerymobile.com1.1.0docspagespagetransitions.html relnofollowhttpdemos.jquerymobile.com1.1.0docspagespagetransitions.htmla , however the limitation is that the link has to be ajax, and can not be activated to new URLs. p  pDoes anyone know how to accomplish this Ideally I would like to use the Flow or Slide transition. However Ill take any example or reference you can provide and adapt it to my needs. p  pThe solution does not necessarily need to be jQuery, it can be javascript, HTML 5, CSS or any other solution that may work.p  pThanks, Andrewp

Negative 2280 pAfter upgrading my Grails project from 1.3.7 to 2.4.0 and after fixing various issues related to the new grails version, I realized that none of the changes done to any object would be persisted anymore at all except if codesaveflushtruecode is called.p  pWith Grails 1.3.7 the default behavior when saving a domain instance using codesavecode is that changes get persisted automatically, due to hibernate flushMode  codeFlushMode.AUTOcode. In Grails 2.4.0 this is not true anymore. The default flushMode of the hibernate session inside any controller action or service class is codeFlushMode.MANUALcode.p  pThings get even stranger when retrieving codesessionFactory.currentSession.flushModecode in BootStrap, where it has a value of codeFlushMode.AUTOcode and in a controller action where it has the value codeFlushMode.MANUALcode. This can be verified by creating a new grails app and putting codeprintln flushMode  sessionFactory.currentSession.flushModecode in BootStrap and in a controller action eg. index.p  pI have been searching through all kind of forums for the last 2 days and did not find any reasonable explanation why this had to be changed in Grails 2.4.0 or maybe even in earlier versions.

Negative 2280 pstrongBackgroundstrong We currently have a Rails application that uses Devise amp LDAP for authentication.  Users simply provide their user amp password to signinlogin and establish a session via a browser. Because we use LDAP we dont need or want to store passwords in our Rails app.  This works great.  We also have a Ruby command line utility that has limited functionality and is primarily used for backend automation, but users can use the client CLI to perform certain actions in our app.  Now we want to add authentication to our Ruby client supported on Windows amp Linux.p  pSo whats the best way to send a users password to our Rails application for authentication  The catch is we dont want users to enter their passwords in clear text on the command line for various reasons.p  pstrongProposalstrong I was thinking about using openssl to create a utility in our Ruby client that allows users to store and encrypt their passwords with perhaps other config info in a local encrypted file.  Our Ruby client could then send this encrypted config file on all HTTPS calls to our Rails app.  On the Rails side we could decrypt the file, extract the password and authenticate the user via Devise LDAP before allowing the requested action.p  pstrongI can think of a few pitfalls with this design and curious if anyone has a better solution or advicestrongp  pNote This is an internal tool so we dont need to be paranoid about security, at the same time we dont want anyone to get someone elses corp password. Ideally this solution also has to prevent any of our app developers from being able to access user passwords as well.p

How do I remove this gap so that the footer stats from where the columns endp  pHTML codep  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetUTF8gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstylemain.cssgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idHTgt ltimg idimgHT srclogo.png height100 width300 gt ltdivgt ltdiv idlsidegtltdivgt ltdiv idcsidegt  ltdivgt ltdiv idrsidegtltdivgt ltdiv idfootergtltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pCSS filep  precodebody   background ffffff      margin 0px      padding 0px   a   color 2b2bf6     textdecoration underline     HT   background FFFFFF      width 800px      height 100px      margin 0px     padding 0px     border 0px   imgHT  margin 5px     padding 5px     border none     height auto     width auto     float left     textalign left   lside  background ffffff  width 200px  height 750px  margin 0px  padding 0px  border 0px  float left   rside  background ffffff  width 400px  height 750px  margin 0px  padding 0px  border 0px  float left   cside  background c0c0c0  width 1040px  height 750px  margin 0px  padding 0px  border 0px  float left   footer  width 1440px  height 70px  margin 0px  padding 0px  border 0px  float left  background 808080  clearboth                              codepre  pEDIT FIDDLE a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcWjt8 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netcWjt8ap

Negative 2280 pI have a JVM server which is the only process running on a 32 core machine.  The server is doing lots of file IO which seems to be causing a slow down in overall performance.  Im confused because all the file IO occurs asynchronously on the same thread and doesnt block any other paths in the program.   Shouldnt the file IO only effect one of the cores, and not the overall performance of the server.  p
Negative 2280 pI know the basics, what not to do in codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode, that may cause scrolling performance to be hindered. And I believe I have followed those rules, which is why I have gotten this far. My codeUITableViewcode is horrible at scrolling, does so very well, but there are times where it stutters for split seconds to seconds, noticeable when it starts to slow down a bit.p  pWithout revealing too much of my code, what here am I doing that could be causing this. I think I have gone over everything and eliminated something that could be causing it, but the problem persists. I feel as if it is something that is obvious and I am overlooking.

Negative 2280 pI am having a slight issue with a full screen fixed background image on a page on my portfolio. On top of it are two divs, an introduction and a description, seperated by a gap  which reveals the background image.p  pTo create the gap to reveal the image, I simply added a big margin to the bottom of the introduction div. On high resolution screens when the browser is full screen this looks perfect, however I have noticed that on lower resolution screens or when the browser window is reduced in height the background image doesnt seem to fill the full height of the window, as a lot of white space is added above the description div. p  pAny suggestions to stop this happening or if there is a better way of achieving this simple effect and ensuring its responsive would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 2280 pI am trying to use a QComboBox to allow a user to either manually input an IP address or select a server from a list of values. I have the QComboBox set to be editable and by default has an empty list. There is a scan function that finds servers on the network and adds entries to the QComboBox list. The list shows the servers name while the IP address is stored in the data for that entry.p  pI am attempting to use the currentIndex function to determine if it is a manual IP address if currentIndex  1 or which entry is selected.p  pIf I input an IP address manually before scanning so the QComboBox list is empty that works. currentIndex is 1 and it parses the IP from the QComboBox text. However, once I scan and add to the list, currentIndex seems only to return a list index 0. Also, when the items are added to the QComboBox list, the first item index 0 is selected automatically.p  pAny ideas about what I need to do to make this work the way I want Do I need a blank list entry to serve as a placeholder for manual input either an empty string or maybe enter IP address prompt Do I need to watch for typing in the QComboBox and set it to index 1 or something Do I need to use something besides index to determine if there was manual entryp  pI have a regex to restrict input into the QComboBox to look like an IP address. This seems to work, though, once list entries are added, I can type letters to begin with. It seems to be trying to autocomplete with the list entries which dont follow the regex since I have the name displayed. I think Im okay with this behavior since once I type a number it sticks to the IP format. I do not want to be able to edit the list entries. I would be okay with adding manual entries by IP address into the list once a connection is made like a history mode, but that is not necessary.p

Ive tried a few permutations of code.selectcode and code.countcode, but my newbness is too great. p  pMaybe it will help if I provide an expected results set. Something likep  precode Collection  Totals        category1       10   category5        9   category8        5   category3        3  codepre

Negative 2280 pI have been working with Xbee for few days and intending to use Xbee Series 1 Arduino UNO as part of Wireless Sensor Network. I want the network to be secured, I can use the Xbees AES capability to make the data transfer secure. But I want to make sure that the senderreceiver all are authentic. How can I be able to ensure that I want to use AT mode.p  pWhat I am trying to say is, suppose there are few nodes XbeeArduino which collects data by sensor and there is one receiver. The receiver sends command to one of the sensor node one to one communication to collect sensor value from that node. My question is, how can that sensor node will be able to know that, the commander is authentic, not some adversary [that somehow knows the command format and sending the command pretending itself as commander] Is there anyway to configure the Xbee so that it can respond to only authentic commander There will be only one commander in the network, but is there anyway to set sensor xbee [as we can configure destination address] so that it will only respond to the authentic commander p

Negative 2280 pAt the office they were experiencing some mystical errors dealing with undeletable folders and files that disappeared. After some deep digging, I found out the cause a directory with a space at the end had been created in OS X, and after syncing this using Bittorrent Sync, the directory had been recreated with the space at the end. Unfortunately, file and folder names having a space at the end cause all kinds of problems in Windows, and the fix was simply to remove the space at the end. Renaming in Windows actually proved quite difficult using CMD or Explorer, so I thought I would circumvent the problem by writing a Python script.p  pUnfortunatly, codeos.walkcode in Python had the same problem it would not traverse into the directories containing a space at the end. Then I tried running the same script under Cygwin, and that worked just fine It traversed into all the directories without problems.p  pSo my question is simply emcan I write a python script that will successfully traverse directories containing a space at the end when running under a normal Python noncygwin installation in Windowsemp  p For reference, here is the output from the two different runsp  pstrongPython 2.7.6 Anaconda 1.9.1 64bit default, Nov 11 2013, 104915 [MSC v.1500 64 bit AMD64] on win32strong p  precodeCUsersCarlErikgtpython spaceremover.py   folderexperiment folderexperiment, [my folder], [afile.txt, My folder with space ] folderexperimentmy folder, [], [] codepre  pstrongPython 2.7.3 default, Dec 18 2012, 135009strong strong[GCC 4.5.3] on cygwinstrongp  precode python spaceremover.py folder folderexperiment, [my folder, My folder with space ], [afile.txt] folderexperimentmy folder, [], [] folderexperimentMy folder with space , [dir1, folderwithspace2 ], [anotherfile.txt] folderexperimentMy folder with space dir1, [], [] folderexperimentMy folder with space folderwithspace2 , [spacefolder3 ], [] folderexperimentMy folder with space folderwithspace2 spacefolder3 , [], []     codepre
Negative 2280 pI have a Gradle project which depends on another external Gradle project. They are completely separate things and do not exist in any common project structure.

Negative 2280 pI have an Image View that I want to center on both the 3.5 and the 4 inch screens. For some reason this is proving to be impossible. I have no idea why Im struggling with this, it seems so basic. p  pIs it possible, using constraints or something, to say center the image on both screens because it is centered on the iPhone 5, but on the 4, its aligned with the top, and it cuts off the bottom of the image, because the image is the size of an iPhone 5 screen.p
Negative 2280 pIve recently ran across a remote shutter for inbuilt camera app using bluetooth on AndroidiOS. p  pHeres an example link of the product that I found a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvcyVG76HDvh4 relnofollowLinka Not here to advertise, but to simply understand technologymechanism behind itp  pAs far as I know, it is not possible to send remote commands to the inbuilt camera apps since there is really no way for the inapp camera apps to handle the remote commands. p  pHowever, the above video shows that such remote control is achieved using the bluetooth remote shutter.  I noticed no external app needs to be installed to use such a remote shutter device. Is the device simply sending a touch event action to the phonep  pI guess my real question is, how would such a remote device send take photo command to the existing inbuilt camera apps p  pThanks,p

Negative 2280 pIm working exercises from the book Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient by Cay S. Horstmann. Therere 2 exercises that ask for different implementations of the same algorithm, one using codemergecode, the other codecomputeIfAbsentcode. Ive implemented the program using codemergecode but cant figure out how to use codecomputeIfAbsentcode to do the same thing.

Negative 2280 pToday I watched a colleague of my program a small game in Python on his Raspberry Pi. The game engine ran by using a codewhiletruecode or infinite loop. I myself use a websocket program in PHP that uses codewhiletruecode. In these examples a infinite while loop is used which doesnt cause the program to become unresponsive. Without it, it wouldnt work properly. However in JavaScript we need to avoid a infinite loop at all costs. When a loop becomes infinite the browser hangs and becomes unresponsive. p  pMy question What is the difference between a eminfinite loopem running in a compiled emPythonem program and a eminfinite loopem written in emJavaScriptem running in a browserp
Negative 2280 pI have an Mvvmcross app that has a TableViewController in root. Each row opens a DetailViewController. And inside each one of it, you can edit it in a EditViewController.p  pSo I have a ViewModel for each view. Im dealing with two problems herep  p1  In DetailViewController i subscribe it to a database message. When i close it, i gotta dispose this subscribeToken. So i would need to call this when DetailViewController got destroyed. But cant call it when it disappears, because when I open editViewController it will send a message that DetailViewController gotta listen to.p  pSo I cannot dispose it in ViewDidDisappear method. But the other option would be in ViewDidUnload. But this method is only called in MemoryWarnings. So it is not disposing the token. That is not good .p  p2 The other problem is for each DetailsViewcontroller that i open, i have to save in Settings what is the current id. and then when I leave, i have to remove it from Settings. So the same problem here. If i remove it in ViewDidDisappear it will remove when im in EditViewController, and i cant, it gotta be set there. But then if i remove only in ViewDidUnload it will not be called, and this variable must be removed.p  pWhen should I call the OnDestroy method to both casesp  pIn Android im calling in OnDestroy. Where should i call it in iOSp  pThanks in regards,p

Negative 2280 pIm used to creating Singletons to implement a globally shared state, and Im reading about how Singletons arent testable and that the Factory pattern should be used instead. The problem Im having is that I cant see where would be a good place to create the Factory object, in order for it to be accessible everywhere.p  pMost online examples of the Factory pattern show the object creation in the codeMaincode method. Im programming in the context of a Web application which is packaged in a WAR.p  pFor example, lets say I have codeServletAcode and codeServletBcode. codeServletAcode creates an instance of the codeFactoryClasscode but when codeServletBcode is invoked, it wont have access to the codeFactoryClasscodes instance.p  pIm new to trying to implement the Factory pattern and I want to try do it the right way, instead of using a Singleton. Also, I want to be able to write more testable code.p

Its the same across the entire cluster. 10.0.1.147 and 10.0.1.148 are my mastersp  precodeSPARKWORKERPORT2181 SPARKDAEMONJAVAOPTSDspark.deploy.recoveryModeZOOKEEPER Dspark.deploy.zookeeper.url10.0.1.1477077,10.0.1.1487077 codepre  pWhen I run startall this happensp  blockquote   pstartall.sh  starting org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master, logging   to   usrlocalsparksbin..logssparkdanielorg.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master1mongoconfig1.out   10.0.1.66 starting org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker, logging to usrlocalsparksbin..logssparkdanielorg.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker1dbmongo1.out   10.0.1.67 starting org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker, logging to usrlocalsparksbin..logssparkdanielorg.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker1dbmongo2.outp blockquote  phere is the beginning of my log file its too many characters to put in this post p  precodecat ..logssparkdanielorg.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master1mongoconfig1.out Spark Command java cp usrlocalsparksbin..confusrlocalsparkassemblytargetscala2.10sparkassembly1.3.0SNAPSHOThadoop2.0.5alpha.jar Dspark.deploy.recoveryModeZOOKEEPER Dspark.deploy.zookeeper.url10.0.1.1477077,10.0.1.1487077 Dspark.akka.logLifecycleEventstrue Xms512m Xmx512m org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master ip mongoconfig1 port 7077 webuiport 8080 Using Sparks default log4j profile orgapachesparklog4jdefaults.properties 150204 155956 INFO Master Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 150204 155956 INFO SecurityManager Changing view acls to daniel 150204 155956 INFO SecurityManager Changing modify acls to daniel 150204 155956 INFO SecurityManager SecurityManager authentication disabled ui acls disabled users with view permissions Setdaniel users with modify permissions Setdaniel 150204 155956 INFO Slf4jLogger Slf4jLogger started 150204 155956 INFO Remoting Starting remoting 150204 155957 INFO Utils Successfully started service sparkMaster on port 7077. 150204 155957 INFO Remoting Remoting started listening on addresses [akka.tcpsparkMastermongoconfig17077] 150204 155957 INFO Remoting Remoting now listens on addresses [akka.tcpsparkMastermongoconfig17077] 150204 155957 WARN NativeCodeLoader Unable to load nativehadoop library for your platform... using builtinjava classes where applicable 150204 155957 INFO Master Starting Spark master at sparkmongoconfig17077 150204 155957 INFO Master Running Spark version 1.3.0SNAPSHOT 150204 155957 INFO Server jetty8.y.zSNAPSHOT 150204 155957 INFO AbstractConnector Started SelectChannelConnector0.0.0.08080 150204 155957 INFO Utils Successfully started service MasterUI on port 8080. 150204 155957 INFO MasterWebUI Started MasterWebUI at httpmongoconfig18080 150204 155958 INFO Master Persisting recovery state to ZooKeeper 150204 155958 INFO CuratorFrameworkImpl Starting 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentzookeeper.version3.4.51392090, built on 09302012 1752 GMT 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmenthost.namemongoconfig1 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentjava.version1.8.031 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentjava.vendorOracle Corporation 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentjava.homeusrjavajdk1.8.031jre 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentjava.class.pathusrlocalsparksbin..confusrlocalsparkassemblytargetscala2.10sparkassembly1.3.0SNAPSHOThadoop2.0.5alpha.jar 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentjava.library.pathusrjavapackageslibamd64usrlib64lib64libusrlib 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentjava.io.tmpdirtmp 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentjava.compilerltNAgt 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentos.nameLinux 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentos.archamd64 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentos.version3.10.0123.13.2.el7.x8664 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentuser.namedaniel 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentuser.homehomedaniel 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Client environmentuser.dirusrlocalsparksbin 150204 155958 INFO ZooKeeper Initiating client connection, connectString10.0.1.1477077,10.0.1.1487077 sessionTimeout60000 watcherorg.apache.curator.ConnectionState39ddcad 150204 155958 INFO ClientCnxn Opening socket connection to server 10.0.1.14810.0.1.1487077.

Negative 2280 pI want to convert an MP4 file to an MPEGDASH video capable of being played through the a hrefhttpsgithub.comDashIndustryForumdash.js relnofollowDASHIF HTML5 playera on Chrome.

Heres one of the many FFMPEG commands Ive triedp  precodeffmpeg y i SintelThirdOpenMoviebyBlenderFoundation.mp4 profilev baseline levelv 30 acodec libvoaacenc vcodec libx264 sintelrecoded.mp4 codepre  pAccording to the ITUT standard, sections 7.4.2.1.1 and A2.1A2.3, a video encoding of avc1.42E01E implies constraint flags of 0xE0 constraintset flags 0, 1 and 2 are set, whereas avc1.42C01E implies constraint flags of 0xC0 constraintset flags 0 and 1 are set. The former 0xE0 implies conformance to the Baseline, Main and Extended profiles, whereas the latter 0xC0 implies conformance to only the Baseline and Main profiles.p  pApparently, FFMPEG doesnt support the Extended profile for H.264.p  pDoes anyone perhaps have any advice as to how to encode an MP4 file as avc1.42E01E Ideally with FFMPEG, but I am open to using other encodersp

Ive replicate the view to another function to see whether its actually changed or not.

Negative 2280 pIn a custom android View Im painting several user input texts that may be BiDirectional. For example Hebrew or Arabic mixed with English text or numbers.

Negative 2280 pI got an application written in YII that from time to time will need version update. Currently, when we release a new update, we manually run a shell script to copyoverwrite the application codesource files from our git repo and set the appropriate permissions and other things, then at the end of the script, we run a YII command to run our database update. We have versioning on our database update. We also rollback changes to the database if one of the sql statements of a version fails. Now the issue occurs if a database update fails, and the application codesource is updated, then it will fail when it tries to access some table fields, table or views.p  pHow to best handle an application update with versioning Much like the way wordpress handles its update or better.p  pWould like to ask for suggestions to the rigth approach, it may include RPM, GIT or other info.

Negative 2280 pIve got a Cocoa Touch Framework for iOS8 obviously with XCode 6.3 that includes both Swift and ObjC classes. This framework is going to be used in a variety of other projects and requires AFNetworking.p  pNow I could just copy the AFNetworking files into the framework, but in case the other projects require AFNetworking as well and add AFNetworking as well via source code or CocoaPods, the project will throw warnings because the AFNetworking classes are included in both the framework and the project and the compiler cant device which one to use.p  pHowever, if I dont add the AFNetworking files to the framework, I cant use them, obviously. In my framework development project Ive tried to add AFNetworking only to the main project and not the framework, but the framework project still cant find them. Is there a way to have the framework project reference classes from the project that implements itp

Negative 2280 pI am working on a vector drawing application in java and I am struggling with the the separation between my model classes and the viewcontroller classes.p  pstrongSome backgroundstrongp  pYou can draw different shapesbr rectangles, lines and pie segmentsp  pThere are 4 tools to manipulate the shapes on the canvasbr scaletool, movetool, rotatetool and morphtoolp  pFor this question the morph tool is the most interesting one It lets you change a shape by dragging one of its points and adjusting the other properties as shown in this graphicp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKBQCr.png altThe different options of manipulating a shapep  pThese Transformation rules are different for each shape and I think they are part of the models business logic but in a way they need to be exposed to the viewcontroller the tool classes so they can apply the correct one.p  pAdditionally the shapes are internally represented via different values   The rectangle is stored as center, width, height, rotation   The line is stored as start and end point   The pie segment is stored as center, radius, angle1, angle2p  pI plan to add more shapes in the future, like stars, speech bubbles or arrows, each with their own control points.p  pI also plan to add more tools in the future, like rotating or scaling groups of shapes. p  pThe control points for each tool are different. Eg when using the scale tool, you can not grab the center point, but each scaling control points needs to be associated with one pivot point or multiple to let the user choose from.p  pFor the simple shapes like rectangle, line and pie the control points are the same for each instance of the class but futures shapes like a bezier path or a star with configurable spike count would have a different amount of control points per instance.p  pstrongSo the question is whats a good way to model and implement these control pointsstrongp  pAs they are slightly different for each tool and carry some toolcontroller specific data they belong to the toolcontroller in some way. But as they are also specific for each type of shape and carry very important domain logic they also belong to the model.p  pI would like to avoid the combinatoric explosion of adding a special type of control point for each combination of toolshape whenever one tool or shape is added.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong To give another example In the future it may occur that I have a idea for a new shape I want to support the arc. It is similar to the pie segment but looks a bit different and behaves completely different when dragging the control points.p  pTo implement this I would like to be able to just create a ArcShape class implementing my Shape interface and be done.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuOXoV.png altThe behaviour of the arc shapep

Negative 2280 pIm working in Eclipse, using the Libgdx game framework to develop an Android application, where Im attempting to move a 2D cursor based on the general movements of the Android device. As Ive read from countless sources already, this is a much harder task than it sounds, due to the wide margin of error that appears during calculation.p  pWhat Ive done so far is pretty primitive pass across a composite linear acceleration sensor from Android, use the acceleration values to calculate velocity, use velocity to calculate displacement, add that onto my cursors x,y coordinates, and lastly make sure the cursor does not exceed the screens dimensions. I dont think it really needs a code example, but heres a watered down version of the core codep  precodeclass attributes Vector2 accel, prevAccel Vector2 velocity Vector2 cursorPos IMyLinearAccelerationSensor las  update code accel  new Vector2las.getAccelXY returns a Vector2 with the x and y acceleration values velocity.x  accel.x  prevAccel.x 2  deltaTime velocity.y  accel.y  prevAccel.y 2  deltaTime cursorPos.x  tempAccel.x  deltaTime cursorPos.y  tempAccel.y  deltaTime  prevAccel  accel update the previous acceleration  if cursorPos.x lt 0    cursorPos.x  0 if cursorPos.y lt 0    cursorPos.y  0 etc. codepre  pThe main issues Im encountering are drift, and the fact that the sensor appears to be more sensitive to movements in the positive directions of x, and y I think. In other words, the cursor accelerates drifts off, gets stuck in the top left corner of the screen, and the respective velocities for x and y never really fall back to 0. Even when moving the device in the opposite direction, the velocity only decreases slightly.p  pGiven all of this information, I just wanted to ask some questions, and for some advice. Firstly, is this is normal behavior, or are there any glaring problems with my code If not, are there any steps that can be taken with my current setup, to resolve these problems with drift, and remove some margin of error e.g. applying different filters to remove noise, applying a resistive force to the velocity, etc. I dont need the movement of the cursor to follow the devices movements too accurately so long as it moves when the device moves, and stops generally when the device stops, I dont mind if theres some small drifting, or lag.p  pI was considering to at some point implement more interfaces to get the raw data from the Android hardware sensors compass, gyroscope, and accelerometer, to generate more accurate results, but even if I do go ahead with this, would this improve much Knowing that this is a complex problem, Id rather not spend too much time on it without good reason. sensor fusion from scratch definitely seems hard...p  pLastly, Im sorry about the lengthy post, and also sorry if this is considered a repeat question. Ive done research, and have seen plenty of other people with similar issues, but Im not quite sure how their solutions might be applied to my own problem. Given my limited knowledge experience, Id appreciate any helpful insight that can be offered.p
Negative 2280 pI am trying to hide any overflow that might occur when a guest makes a forum topic post.  In the image below are a list of topics.

The posts with the Ws and the Is work fine when overflowhidden is applied.  But, for example, the post that says Architects may be the one thing I can think of this time but.... crams on top of itself and overflow hidden has no effect.  Here is the image.

Negative 2280 pIm new to windows programming and I have a question about painting the windows, specifically about codeBeginPaintcode function p  pWhen I was reading about it on a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopff38140128vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMSDNa it says thatp  blockquote   pStart the painting operation by calling the BeginPaint function. This function fills in the PAINTSTRUCT structure with information on the repaint request.

Is that correct p  pthanks in advance.p

The webapp includes a social network, organisers can create their own profile, users can bookmark all sorts of things, ... well, there will be pretty database intensive actions well be using a relatively complex relational model with MySQL.br We might still be using Node to handle push notifications with web sockets but we havent really discussed this yet.  p  pSince well get time at school to work on our project in group, Id have plenty of time to build the backend REST api with Java which seems like a huge opportunity for me in terms of time. Im just wondering if there would be any real tradeoffs to do it with Java for this purpose.  p  pThanks. p

Negative 2280 pSo Google Drive has a lot of security, which is a good thing. By default, my app can only get the files it has itself created on the users drive. However, I also need to be able to retrieve all files placed by the user or another app in one of the folders that my app created.p  pExamplep  ul liMy app creates a folder called Stuffli liNow the user manually uploads a file called test.txt and places it in Stuff.li liMy app cant see this file, even though the app created the folder that the file is in. This is what Id like to fix.li ul  pIn addition, I have seen code on stackoverflow and other places which gives my app access to the users ENTIRE google drive, but Id like to avoid doing that. I only need access to the files created inside folders created by my app, not everything. Besides, the code that I found about this was all from 2012 or earlier and doesnt work anymore due to undocumented changes in the PHP API.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 2280 pSeveral users of one of my apps are having random crashes. The crash log doesnt contain any reference to methods written by myself and hence, is hard to read. Also the crash is very hard to reproduce so I cant use tooling such as NSZombieEnabled to gain more information.p  pBased on the crash report see below I have the assumption its because my apps NSWindow object is requested or informed to resize in an animated way hence, the timer and delay information but theres a button NSButton that is causing an issue probably its deallocated since Im having a SIGSEGV.
