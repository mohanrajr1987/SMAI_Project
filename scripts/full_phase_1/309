Positive 309 pGiven an input of a perfect cube of a number which denotes number of nodes of a network, I want to be able to return the neighbors of all nodes as they would be connected in a 3d grid. For example if I am given 27 nodes I want to write a program to return all neighbors of all nodes. 0 will have neighbors 1,9,4 as it is a corner node. But an internal node will have one edge extra so 2 will have 0,3,11,5. Any mathematical way of formulating this It is quite clear that number of node Or  square of cuberoot of total number of nodes will give me a neighbour. For example 0 has 9, 1 has 10 and so on. Any way of finding out which nodes are corner and which are middle nodes So that we can find out if a node has 3 neighbours or 4.p

Positive 309 pI would like to generate 3D white objects in blackwhite images using Matlabs nlfilter or a similar functiontool. p  pIn 2D, I start with some white seed points, which eventually define the regionsobjects in my 2D image. By applying nlfilter successively, I can naturally grow these regions until all pixels are labeled. Id like to do a similar thing in 3D, but nlfilter works only on 2D images. Treating a 3D image as a stack of 2D images and applying nlfilter on each such slice is one of the possible ways to overcome this problem, but its not suboptimal. Instead, an nlfilter3d function would have been much more convenient.  Does any similar function exist in Matlab or elsewherep

Positive 309 pIm a physics student and my field of interest is fluid simulations.

Our goal is to visualize the Zmap as a 2d Surface, so we thought of creating a point cloud, generate a mesh and display it with some 3D library We thought vtk could be the right choice, but we encountered some problem.p  pFirst we tried unorganized structure vtkPolyData, generating meshes by 3dDalaunay triangulation. But the code is properly working when number of points is lt 50k. Our 3D reconstruction is composed by 480k points and the computation time is really too much high.p  pThen we switched to organized point with connections. IMHO this additional information should reduce computation time to create mesh, but we are not able to understand how to create a vtkStructuredGrid and to feed it with our Z values to get a 2D meshed surface.p  pIs it the proper way to do Has anyone never tried thisp  pThanks in advancep

Positive 309 pMoving this question to game dev. please mark as closed.p  pI am quite new to the world of game development and i am trying really hard to wrap my mind around some finer details. p  pstrongemThis question ended up being quite large so please refer to the summary at the end if you prefer not having to read everythingemstrongp  pI am trying to create an online sandbox MMO with persistent world. Ill allow the players to terraform and dig the terrain quite like you can see in Space Explorers or like the asteroids in space engineers.p  pthat being said, Ive spent quite a lot of hours online reading infos here and there but i never could find unified info on how everything should fit together to give the result i am aiming for. After so many sessions of neurons burning transcendental reflection, I think I came up with a unified way of doing things and would like the insight of more experienced programmers to guide me.p  p1 first of all, I guess that i need some kind of outline for my world, since its gonna be a prefabricated world, i can pregenerate a surface and store it server side and only feed part of it to players based on where they are standing in that world. I think the term isosurface works in this case but im not quite certain. I would generate a surface with something like perlin noise and store its x,y and z coordinates as a mesh server side. p  p2 then, the client would need to draw the actual terrain from that surface, here comes marching cubes i think. I dont think the terrain mesh needs to be the same scale as the world for it to work but i might be wrong. For example, my terrain mesh, sever side, could be only 10x10x10 but my actual world, client side, could have a resolution of 100x100x100 and compute the shape of each cubes from this 103 isosurface.p  p3 now, not being sure on how this would reflect since i got lots of examples of marching cubes but none with a visual isosuface dataset to clearly see the whole picture, but if im right, i take 2 vertices on my isosurface and compute a vector between them. then, client side, I check all the cubes in the same area of those 2 vertices and check whether they are inside or outside of the terrain and shape them accordingly. Rince and repeat for all pairs of vertices on the isofurvace and this should give my my world rightp  pgosh, this question became quite the exercise of summarisation p  pstrongemso, in short, to generate a deform able terrain in my sandbox i would need toemstrongp  ol ligenerate a rough map of the surface and store its vertices, as a mesh, server side.li lifeed part of it to the client based on where they are and used the surface mesh to generate marching cubes.li lithe process of generating marching cubes is to take 2 vertices from the isosurface and test them on corresponding regions of my client side world to see whether the block vertices are above or below the terrain and thus shape the cubesli ol  pis this line of approach viable for a large scale multiplayer game strongor rather, do you see any major flaws in my logicstrongp  pI have quite a lot to code and would find myself quite displeased if by the end it was all for nothingp

Positive 309 pIm currenty writing an application that should check if it is possible to align different bars and connectors the way a designer has intended it. To do that I want to load the 3DModels Wavefront Objects of the bars and connectors, place them the way the designer intended and check for collisions between the different models.p  pNow when Im searching for collision detection I usually read that you should never ever check for collisions based on the mesh but rather simplify the model, therefore most tools I tried do not even allow you to check for collisions based on the mesh or they simplify that process. The problem is that people are talking about game development most of the time, but my use case is completely different. I dont even need to be very efficient. One detection per second would be more than enough, while games of course need those checks way more often. p  pRight now Im working with BulletSharp a .Net wrapper for the bullet physics engine and I get decent results. When I simplify my mesh with HACD convex decomposition first and then check for collisions it works most of the time, but sometimes when the parts are very close to each other I get collisions when there shouldnt be any, like you can see on the picture the red color indicates, that there is a collision between the parts. Interesting is, that it works even worse when I use the detailed object model instead of the simplified one.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comCksyx.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCksyx.png altExample of not really colliding objectsap  pAre there any other approaches for such a use case Maybe other engines or libraries that could help me preferable but not necessarily in .Netp
Positive 309 pThis is a problem that I meet on Unity3D, but its actually a request for help for a general graphical algorithm. I have a set of 3D objectsmeshes that form a map.

To generalize, we can say that also the box will end to be an array of 9 numbers position, size and rotation.p  pSo at the end Im talking about a function that takes a set of array[6] and returns an array[9].p  pThe box can be obviously rotated in 3 directions as needed, so its not just take the smallest and the biggest x, y and z values.p  pProbably this question can some how easily resolved with a few trigonometrical functions, but i dont have any idea of how to do it I only could create something that does that iteratively, but thats not what I want.p  pA particular case of this problem could be to find the minimum box containing a set of points. Probably this question is easier and some how can be extended to the main problem. Anyway... I cant solve neither this one p  pThanks for the help.p

Positive 309 pIm currently using a Microsoft Kinect for Windows in a project. I use the Kinect for 3D scanning an object and then I want to reconstruct it to get a .stl file which can be 3D printed.

Positive 309 pI am interested in making two 3d topographic plots that display side by side in the same Xquartz device window. Displaying two 3d plots in the same window is straightforward using the rgl package  there are plenty of examples in the documentation using mfrow3d and other methods.  p  pHowever, I need to use the plot3D function from the rasterVis package.  The reason I am using plot3D from rasterVis, rather than something like surface3d from rgl, is that I need to use the drape argument in plot3D to display values from a raster as colors on a 3d topographic map and this raster has different values than the one that creates the z axis on the plot.  If anyone has tips on something analogous to drape within an rgl function, I would also be interested in thatp  pWhen I try to use mfrow3d along with the plot3D function, it brings up a series of blank device windows instead of displaying the two plots side by side in the same window.p  pHere is some code to make a topographic map using plot3D, from the rasterVis documentationp  precode    datavolcano     r lt rastervolcano     extentr lt c0, 610, 0, 870     levelplotr, col.regionsterrain.colors     plot3Dr codepre  pAnd here is where I try to use mfrow3d to plot 2 identical volcano plots side by side, one in blue and one in red, which I adapted from the rgl documentationp  precode    volcanos lt listr, r     col lt cblue, red     open3d     mfrow3d1,2     for i in 12      next3d        plot3Dvolcanos[[i]], colcol[i]      codepre  pIs what I am trying to do even possible with plot3D from rasterVis Any ideas would be much appreciated p

Negative 309 pI am trying to develop a mini DSL for software configuration, using antlworks for prototyping. A typical source would look likep  precodename myname value myvalue flag debug     value  debugvalue  if flagdebug     libname  food  else     libname  foo  codepre  pNow, I never got a formal course on parsing, so I am doing all this by trialerror from antlworks and some basics on BNF grammars.

Negative 309 pWere in the process of creating a new API for our product, which will be exposed via web services. We have an internal debate whether the API should be as easy as possible to use in the price of making more calls or make it as efficient as possible rendering it harder to use. For example, here are two issues that came upp  ul liShould we manage session info on the server, or should we pass that info back to the user, and expect him to send it back to us when needed Please ignore the security implications of a sessionli liShould we combine calls that are likely to be consequent, in order to save the time spent on the round trip in between, even if they dont really share the same logical functionalityli ul  pBasically, the desktop people are in favor of a clear, easy to use API, while the internet people would like to make it as efficient as possible.

Other components on the system are probably going to have a much larger affect on the performance, and hard to use APIs are much more error prone.

Negative 309 pI am using the PagedCollectionView for grouping. I have a DataGrid  and a textbox with a search button. The ItemSource of the grid is my PagedCollectionView, and the PagedCollectionView wraps an ObservableCollection because items in the grid can have their bound objects updated by a background process. When you click search, I first clear by ObservableCollection then load it with data from a db. The moment I call clear on my collection, the contents on of the DataGrid disappear, INCLUDING THE COLUMNS. They reappear when items are added to my collection. I would really like the columns and their headers to remain, as when they disappear it is quite jarring, not to mention sort orders, etc are lost. I believe the items disappear instantaneously because it is an ObservableCollection, but I need it to be so that the rows can be updated by the aforementioned background process. If I remove the PagedCollectionView as a wrapper and simply set the ItemSource of the DataGrid to the ObservableCollection, none of this behavior occurs, my columns and headers persist even when the collection is cleared, and my rows update instantaneously by the background process.

Negative 309 pI have an unusual environment in a project where I have many files that are each independent standalone scripts. All of the code required by the script must be in the one file and I cant reference outside files with includes etc.p  pThere is a common function in all of these files that does authorization that is the last function in each file. If this function changes at all as it does now and then it has to changed in all the files and there are plenty of them.p  pInitially I was thinking of keeping the authorization function in a separate file and running a batch process that produced the final files by combining the auth file with each of the others. However, this is extremely cumbersome when debugging because the auth function needs to be in the main file for this purpose. So Id always be testing and debugging in the folder with the combined file and then have to copy changes back to the uncombined files.p  pCan anyone think of a way to solve this problem i.e. maintain an identical fragment of code in multiple files.p

Negative 309 pIm having a strange problem with Android 1.6p  pI have an application that has a ListView found in Activity 1.  p  pThe user can click on one of the rows in the ListView and is taken to a 2nd Activity Activity  2.  p  pUser can then use the back button to go back to the ListView.p  pThe problem is that if the user scrolls down the list after returning from Activity  2 the application crashes, but doesnt leave a traditional stack trace.p  pIf I look at LogCat, I see the following show up right before the crash see below.p  pThe additional strangeness is that when I attach the debugger to try and pinpoint the error, strongI cant reproduce the errorstrongp  pstrongAny thoughts on what LogCat is telling me herestrong  Theres a small section near the end of the log shown below that indicates debuggerd committing suicide to free the zombie, which sounds like a memory leak, but google isnt giving me much luck with this error.p  pstrongThoughts on what to try nextstrongp

Negative 309 pIve got a messages table in MySQL which records messages between users. Apart from the typical ids and message types all integer types I need to save the actual message text as either VARCHAR or TEXT. Im setting a frontend limit of 3000 characters which means the messages would never be inserted into the db as longer than this.p  pIs there a rationale for going with either VARCHAR3000 or TEXT Theres something about just writing VARCHAR3000 that feels somewhat counterintuitive. Ive been through other similar posts on Stack Overflow but would be good to get views specific to this type of common message storing.p  pAny help would be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 309 pIve created my own Delegate for a ObjC class. The class itself deals with Core Data operations. Delegate methods are used to inform other classes about changes that happened to the datastore. The class that deals with the datastore is called Datastore and its delegate is called DatastoreDelegate. A UIViewController of mine ContactsViewController implements the delegate.p  pMy DatastoreDelegate is declared as followedp  precodeclass Datastore protocol DatastoreDelegate ltNSObjectgt optional  voiddidAddMessageMessage message  voiddidUpdateContactContact contact  voiddidAddContactContact contact  voiddidUpdateContactContact contact  voiddidDeleteContacts end codepre  pThe weird thing is, my  code all worked fine with these methods except for the [didAddMessage] method. Whenever I try to call this delegate from within the Datastore class I get an error from the ContactsViewController. The error tells me the [didAddMessage] selector is missing in the ContactsViewController instance Unrecognized selector sent to instance. How can the selector be missing if its optionalp  pI should note that my Datastore class is a Singleton. Im not sure if this is somehow related to this issue Im having.p

Negative 309 pI am trying to create a function to find the square root of a number. For debugging purposes, it has instructions to print current variable values.

But I dont want to use it, has it make things too complicated and doesnt allow full git features.p  pEDITp  pIt turns out that as GitHub SVN repos are not real SVN Repos it is not possible to use svnsync.

Negative 309 pin my Win Forms app I create an array of dynamic custom controls inside a loop. These, lets call them boxes, are like my basic pieces of information. I also create string arrays in other parts of the code that contain the information of this boxes, so that for example string[3] is a variable of box[3] and so does stringa[3], stringb[3], stringc[3]... all the arrays with the same index are related to the box with that index. Hope I make myself clear.p  pOnly 2 of this strings are shown in 2 labels inside each custom control box in the array, but the others are there because I want to make something so that when the user clicks one of these controls the other strings can be shown in another control. Sort of something like More Information.... All the boxes in the array need to have the same event handler because I create 100.p  pTo put it more into context, each custom control box in the array shows the Symbol and the Price of a stock and I want that when the user clicks on each stock more quote information is shown on another special control which is like a placeholder for More info.p  pI am thinking of 2 ways to do itp  ul liIf I could detect the index of the clicked control which is the same in the strings related to it, I could just set this to an int strongjstrong and all I have to do is show all the strings a,b,c... with index strongjstrong. emUnfortunately I cannot find a way to do this, maybe it is not even possible.emli liThe other way I have thought is to create some properties for my custom control which store this variables, and in my app instead of assigning strings I would set properties for each control, which I could later retrieve when the control is clicked. I havent tryed this because I dont know exactly how to do it.li ul  pWhat do you think Do you know how can I achieve this or do you have a different idea that will work Please help Thanks in advance.p

Negative 309 pI recently ran into a problem when using a private inheritance scheme in which the base class defined a template method and the privately derived class made that method public via a using declaration under the codepubliccode access specifier.

However, upon attempting to pass the name of the function to the derived class template method, I receive an error message that states that the baseclass method cannot access a private member declared in the derived class.

Left clicking on the Canvas Paths enclosed region should toggle the IsSelected property, which should also change the Paths animation and ultimately color and thickness.p  hr  pemApproach 1emp  pPerhaps I can hook onto the interaction event i.e. MouseLeftButtonUp and update the IsSelected property value in the code behind and start a StoryBoard or change the VisualState to animate the Canvas Path. While this may be fine from the animations perspective, it strongly couples the view to its view model  data context unless I cast the data context to some IIsSelectable interface.p  hr  pemApproach 2emp  pPerhaps I can create a Behavior that toggles the IISelectable mentioned above property and starts the StoryBoard or changes the VisualState. As the Canvas is a Control, it would probably be better to use the VSM rather than just StoryBoards else I would have to somehow pass a reference to the StoryBoard to the Behavior, maybe.p  hr  pemApproach 3emp  pPerhaps I can use twoway binding with a dual converter so that the initial animation of Canvas Path is determined by the IsSelected property value, but user interactions will change the animation  VisualState which will then update the IsSelected property value. If this is the case, would I convert the Canvas Paths border colorthickness property or is there a way to properly convert the VisualState to and from the IsSelecteds boolean valuep  hr  pThese are just a few ideas off the top of my head.

Negative 309 pSo I posted a question earlier about left joining the result of a query where a group by is used to another table, and it causing extremely inefficient Outer Apply nested within Cross Apply sql.  I didnt get anything useful from the responses though I do appreciate the effort, so I decided to do some more research.p  pon Cross Apply amp Outer Applyp  blockquote   pCross Apply and Outer Apply Operatorsp      pThese operators are not available in   SQL Server 2000. LINQ to SQL tries a   series of rewrites to replace them   with appropriate joins.p      pCross Apply and Outer Apply are   generated for relationship   navigations. The set of queries for   which such rewrites are possible is   not well defined. For this reason, the   minimal set of queries that is   supported for SQL Server 2000 is the   set that does not involve relationship   navigation.p blockquote  pI wont ask why they though this was a good idea, but Id like to know if there is a way to force linq to sql into 2000 mode.  That would seem to solve my issue.p

However, I would still be interested in a solution which could emspecificiallyem remove this error message for overloading figure.m or some selfdefined list of functions instead of for all functions. I guess Im asking a bit too much here  p
Negative 309 pI have a simple list of strings that I populate into an Adapter per the following code using Mono for Androidp  precode    var adapter  new ArrayAdapterthis, Android.Resource.Layout.SimpleSpinnerItem, DBHelper.AircraftTypes     adapter.SetDropDownViewResourceAndroid.Resource.Layout.SimpleSpinnerDropDownItem     aircraftType.Adapter  adapter codepre  pDBHelper.AircraftTypes returns the List for the adapter.

However, between the 4th and the 5th, there is a delay of about 60ms. The same thing happens between the 8th and the 9th, the 12th and 13th and on...p  pThere seems to be a relation between the bytes per frame and the moment of the delay. I know this because if I change to 4 bytes per frame, I start having the delay between the 8th and the 9th, then between the 16th and the 17th, the 24th and the 25th...

One of them is thisp  pI have a VM that defines a masterdetail screen. In the detail section, I want to divide the detail lines across multiple DataGrids on a tab control. Each DataGrid contains a distinct subset of the detail lines based on the value of a property in the line Section. So essentially, I read my master entity which contains a collection of detail entities. And I think I need to expose different views of this collection to the View so that the DataGrids can each bind to the proper filtered subset of the details collection. The DataGrids have to be editable. Ive made a few attempts at exposing various levels of CollectionViews as ItemsSources for the DataGrids but nothing seems to work properly. Also, Im thinking it would probably be best to factor out the DataGrids into a generic View since they all display the same info just over a different subset of details but Im not sure how to do that.

Its unfortunate that your application  wouldnt function with a custom web directoryapplication as this  has been used as a work around previously.      I can understand the frustration with this as its basically a  failure between two Microsoft technologies which are meant to work  together.

Negative 309 pI think that many C developers collided with a such problem there is some enumeration in standart .net library and many standart classes and their methods to work with them. But if you want to extend this enum by adding some fields that is not possible, but It can efficiently simplify process of developing and cant disturb working of those standart classes. I describe It by concrete example There is an enum TraceOptions in the System.Diagnostics namespace and it is used by TraceListeners. Lets I want to design Listener with some extra options like AssemblyName and so on. Now I must to create new enum containing all of my extra options which supplement options from TraceOptions enum. Then to add new property ExtraTraceOptions to my Listener. But what if I can to write something like thisp  precodeenum MyExtraEnum  TraceOptions    AssemblyName  128  codepre  pMyExtraEnum will extend TraceOptions by new fields, which must not intersect with fields of TraceOptions nor by names, nor by values. Then I can use TraceOptions with new fields likep  precode     TraceOptions t  TraceOptions.AssemblyName IntelliSense may display that this  field is extended field from MyExtraEnum enumeration codepre  pI understand that this can corrupt existing code using TraceOptions enum, but If I am sure that It will not happen and all resposibility for using such features is lying on me.p  pWhat do you do about such feauturep

Negative 309 pI have some unit tests set up in my PowerBuilder application that run through CruiseControl.NET via a NAnt script.p  pIn the past few days Ive come across an issue where every test run will return the error code code1073741819code, which I cant seem to find much information about.p  pI have come across this error in the past when the .exe was set to run a whole bunch of tests at once, but I managed to work around this by having only a single test at a time, with the test number passed as a command line paramater to my unit test exe. I then have a for loop in my NAnt script that will loop through each test to run it. For well over 6 months this seemed to be a viable solution I was thinking that maybe it was an out of memory error, since it seemed to happen only when more than 50 test were run in a single instance.p  pHas anyone had any experience with unit tests in PowerBuilder I believe the unit test framework used is emPBUnitem, though Im not entirely sure if this is important I can find out. Its setup so that it compiles the program to an exe lets say main.exe, and to run the unit tests you just need to pass particular command line paramaters to main.exe when launching, and it will start running the unit tests rather than launching the program.p  pIf theres any particular piece if information that anyone needs to help me find a solution, let me know and Ill see what I can find out.p  pThanks, Josh.p  hr  pstrongEdit 1 13122011 139PMstrongp  pAttached is a screenshot of the event viewer error that shows up when running it from the command line via remote desktop.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combOEnx.png altEvent Viewer Errorp  hr  pstrongEdit 2 13122011 208PMstrongp  pAttached is a screenshot of the event viewer error that shows up when running it from CruiseControl.NETp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVZJ8v.png altEvent Viewer Error via CruiseControlp

Negative 309 pI have a function codeeventIterablecode in six different classes, each with different names. These classes are being stored in an codeObject[]code.p  pI have a custom codeArrayListcode class I had to create my own  long story, dont bother suggesting I use the standard one, and within it, you can access indexes from the codeArrayListcode.p  pEach of these class objects are stored at an index in the array list.

Negative 309 pI have searched STACKOVERFLOW and other forums for the solution to my problem  if I have missed a working solution please point me towards it.p  pMy Problem Whenever dragging an element a portlet div in my sortable list, I need to perform some action BEFORE the actual drag process starts From what I understand before the START event is fired.p  pTo be more specific My DIVs provide the user with the possibility to extend  collapse its body like in the example seem at the jquery UI page a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdemossortableportletshttpjqueryui.comdemossortableportletsa.p  pWhenever dragging an element Id like to trigger my collapse methode so that the only visual element being dragged is the collapsed DIV.p  pHowever whenever I call my methode something like thisp  precodesomeitem.triggertoggle.somenamespace  codepre  pit works as expected, except that the HEIGHT of the dragged helper gets calculated BEFORE the start event ist fired in the sortable and therefore the helper has the height of the original element in its uncollapsed state.p  pMy original thought on this was as the sortable has e.g. the posibility the measure a drag distance before the actual drag procedure starts with the option emdistanceem it should be possible hook into this flow, for example storing the original emstartDragem function or whatever it is called of the sortable widget in a temporary var, override it with a custom callback which first triggers my collapse functionality and then calls the original function to ensure that the height is calculated correctly. However  I did not have much success with this approach so far...p  pPlease note that setting css properties in the handlers for the drag or over event of the sortable has not the desired effect, as the height the sortable widget calculated for the helper is set as element properties.p  pOr  probably someone knows a better way to affect the height of the helper being displayed during the drag process, its just my opinion that my original approach changing the element before the drag process and then let the widget do its calulations the way it was intented would be a better soltution...p  pthanks for any assistance, matthiasp  pEDIT Setting the sortable flag forceHelperSize to true and setting the ui.item  helper size in the start draghandler does not work either, as it result in the desired effect visually only the collapsed item is dragged, but stops the element from being dragged down all the way as if the item would still have the height in its uncollapsed state tested with helper original and clonep

Negative 309 pI have a socket feeding into a sax parser, formatted as a ISO 88591 stream. Every so often there is an invalid character, and I get a SAXParseException with a row and column where that happened, so I need to see what the data is at that point or more importantly log it.p  pOriginally the lines that processed the data werep  precodeInputSource is  new InputSourcenew InputStreamReadersocket.getInputStream, ISO88591 XMLReader reader  XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader reader.setContentHandlernew ResponseParseHandleretc, id reader.parseis codepre  pProblem is that I cant get the data after the event of this happening, so I changed it to read into a large byte buffer, convert it to a string and parse that data with a StringReader. Unfortunately the data coming from the socket is spread out in small chunks over a long time, so it will start with the root tag when it first connects, but then there will be thousands of separate messages without a closing tag.p  pBecause I am parsing these strings individually when they come in the first one has an error that it doesnt have a closing tag, and the following ones error as they dont have a base tag. This doesnt happen with the socket as I assume the stream is still openp  pPresumably I can feed these strings to another reader  writer but it seems to be getting really complicated just to find out what the block of data was at the time of the error.p  pIs there something really simple I am missing herep

Negative 309 pits a kind of clientserver architecture problem.p  pI have 2 projects in my solution one project for the client side working with Entity Framework and SQL Server Compact database and another one for the server side also working with Entity Framework but with a real SQL Server database. Both databases have exactly the same database schema, so although  they are using different .edmx files, the generated entities looks the same and only differ in namespaces. By the way Im using the ADO.NET DbContext Generator to generate persistence ignorant entity classes. So far so good. Now I wrote a quite large class with all the server database access methods inside, e.g.p  precode    public User CreateUserstring userId, string username, bool isGlobalAdmin              using var context  new ServerEntities                      try                              var user  new User                                      UserID  userId,                     Username  username,                     IsGlobalAdmin  isGlobalAdmin                                   context.User.Adduser                 context.SaveChanges                  return user                          catch Exception ex                              HandleEfExceptionex                                return null      codepre  pThe problem is that I need the same class with the same methods on the client side. So I would copy this class to the client project, rename ServerEntities into ClientEntities and change the namespace for using client entities. This is quite ugly, because I need to maintain both classes, if something changes. Is there a way to abstract the whole thing and use the same class which is located in a separate prject the other two projects refer to on both sides client and serverp  pI would really appreciate your help.p  pBest,p  pAntonyp

Negative 309 pANN Artificial Neural Networks and SVM Support Vector Machines are two popular strategies for supervised machine learning and classification. Its not often clear which method is better for a particular project, and Im certain the answer is always it depends. Often, a combination of both along with Bayesian classification is used.p  pThese questions on Stackoverflow have already been asked regarding ANN vs SVMp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8326485annandsvmclassificationANN and SVM classificationap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7316671whatthedifferenceamongannsvmandknninmyclassificationquestionwhat the difference among ANN, SVM and KNN in my classification questionap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2434536supportvectormachineorartificialneuralnetworkfortextprocessingSupport Vector Machine or Artificial Neural Network for text processingap  pIn this question, Id like to know emspecificallyem what aspects of an ANN specifically, a Multilayer Perceptron might make it desirable to use over an SVM The reason I ask is because its easy to answer the emoppositeem question Support Vector Machines are often superior to ANNs because they avoid two major weaknesses of ANNsp  p1 ANNs often converge on emlocal minimaem rather than global minima, meaning that they are essentially missing the big picture sometimes or missing the forest for the treesp  p2 ANNs often emoverfitem if training goes on too long, meaning that for any given pattern, an ANN might start to consider the noise as part of the pattern.p  pSVMs dont suffer from either of these two problems. However, its not readily apparent that SVMs are meant to be a total replacement for ANNs. So what emspecificem advantages does an ANN have over an SVM that might make it applicable for certain situations Ive listed emspecificem advantages of an SVM over an ANN, now Id like to see a list of ANN advantages if any.p

Negative 309 pI am creating a web service to expose to my mobile apps.  I currently am implementing a token based authentication solution because that what I have done in the past however, I am struggling in this context to understand why I do not simply pass the username and password each time  I can maintain the password in RAM while running the Mobile app encrypted between usages if we want to get overly complicated and then pass it each time I connect to the server and repeat the hash verification each time.  Of course everything is SSL so there is no more risk in terms of network transfer in doing it each time versus do it once is there  The only CON I see is that the hash validation process might me more expensive than a token validation  maybe.  Are there other cons I am missing here p

Negative 309 pIf you are building a large cloud based platform, you will have so many different modulescomponents within that platform. This ranges from web service configurations address, ports,... to domain specific configurations for every component that you have. One can configure such system by giving every component in the system a tockenized config file and then have a big tocken resolving file for the entire platform. This gets messy in no timep  pI was thinking that maybe a better approach to centralize the whole platform configuration into a web service as the central configuration system for the platform and then every component in the system come to this web service and request their configuration settings by providing their id or a unique config name. p  pI even think that such configuration must be type safe so that all the system component refer to their desired configuration explicitly vs a keyvalue way approach. p  pAnother important feature of this central configuration system should be the ability to make configuration values dependent on the server side so that I would be able to sayp  pcomponent1Config.LogServiceAddress  someMasterConfig.Address p  pat the server side. So only the central configuration system knows about the above logic and component1 simply gets a value for its LogServiceAddress without knowing how that was resolved by the central configuration system.p  pMy question is, does such central configuration system already exist Is there any open source software out there providing such central configuration system capabilitiesp

Negative 309 pSuppose I have the following codep  precodenamespace x     class X         virtual void x        namespace y     class Y  public xX          void x        int main     xX a  new yY     agtxXx Tries to access xXx nonvirtually.                    Fails, since it treats the first x as the                    function name instead of the namespace  codepre  pAs you see, the last line of the main method tries to call the x method of class xX statically i.e. nonvirtually. However, this fails, since the namespace has the same name as the method both are named x. Therefore, the compiler treats the first x as method name and then complains that xX makes no sence.p  pThe problem might seem hypothetical on first sight, but it really appears in our code The namespace cannot be renamed that easily because it is the namespace of a big project. The method name cannot be changed because it has to adhere to some other super class that is out of our scope library class.p  pSo, is there any chance to disambiguate this syntax somehow so that I am still able to call the method xXx nonvirtuallyp  pRight now, the only solution I see is typdefing xX and then using the typedef. Is there any solution without typedefp

Negative 309 pOk, so I have a normal codeviewControllercode that has a codeUIScrollViewcode in it that gives details about distilleries. What I wanted to do was have a list of spirits that are distilled at the distillery that they are reading about. So I attempted to implement a codeUITableViewcode inside of my codeUIScrollViewcode, and after hooking everything up and writing all the delegate and datasource methods I come to find out that a codeUITableViewcode will not work inside of a codeUIScrollViewcode. So does anybody have any ideas as to what kind of User Interface Object I can use to accomplish something like a UITableViews dynamic characteristics I dont want to use a codeUITextViewcode because it just looks cheap and unstructured. I need something that can dynamically change the number of items shown because not all distilleries will have the same amount of spirits distilled there.p

I dont want to delete the binary I have so far, just append bytes at the end of an item.li liI want to be able to read from a video item while it is being written. Thread A will update the video item, adding more and more bytes, while Thread B will read from the item, receiving all the bytes written by Thread A as soon as they are writtenflushed.li ol  pI tried writing the straightforward code to do that, but it failed. It seems MongoDB doesnt allow multithreaded access to the binary even if one thread is doing all the writing, nor could I find a way to add to a binary file  the Java GridFS API only gives an InputStream from an already existing GridFSDBFile, I cannot get an OutputStream to write to it.p  ul liIs this possible via MongoDB, and if so how li liIf not, do you know of any other DB that might allow this preferably nothing too complex such as a full relational DB li liWould I be better off using MongoDB to keep only the metadata of the video files, and manually handle reading and writing the binary data from the filesystem, so I can implement the above requirements on my ownli ul  pThanks,p  pAlp

Negative 309 pEven though I am a relatively precise typist, it is a common error for me to wallop the apostrophe character when I go to hit a carriage return in Vim. This happens especially when I am trying to type codewltCRgtcode or codewqltCRgtcode. I end up typing codewltCRgtcode, or even worse, codewqltCRgtcode, which gives a couple big red error messages in addition to not doing what I intend. Is there a mapping or some other technique that can be used to overcome this I cant imagine why I would ever want to write a file named codecode, so I am not concerned about blocking that possibility entirely. p

Negative 309 pim completely new to Qt but i managed to get some simple windows and frames to work. Im running Eclipse on a 64 bit Kubuntu system. After editing my code in Eclipse, im running qmake and make from command line.p  pYesterday i gave a try to Qt Designer, which works fine for me, compared to hardcode the widgets and buttons in eclipse. However, i wont switch to QT Creator because im very used to Eclipse.p  pMy goal is to create the GUI in Qt Designer and use the generated code in Eclipse.p  pRunning qmake project, qmake and make generates a header file for my Mainwindow, containing the class code.p  pBut when i try to include this header file in my Eclipse code, make stops with an error because g cant find the header file seems the header has not been created yet.p  pI have to admit, im still confused about the Qt building process. So, how could i manage to design my GUI via Qt Designer and still use Eclipse as my coding IDEp  pGreetings, luggep  pEdit  My Eclipse Project is a Empty Makefile Project. As far as i know, this means i have to take care of the whole build process.  Eclipse wont do anything for me.p  pI have not tried running make from Eclipse because the Makefile has to be generated by qmake. Thus, after eiting and saving my code in Eclipse i run qmake and make from command line.p  pQmake senses there is a .ui file and generates the header file for this class. Problem is if i try to include this header in Eclipse, my source code file cant be compiled.p  pFor me it seems thats when make invokes g with my source code file, the header of the GUI has not been created.p  pSo why am I doing it this way Well, I dont want to be addicted to a IDE like Qt Creator or stuff. Because that means, everony trying to compile my project needs metainformations such as a configfile or projectspecific settings for that specific IDE.p  pIn my Cprojects i use a handwritten Makefile, so you just need to have GCC installed which you usually have and type make.p  pIm trying to get as close as possible to this with Qtprojects.p
Negative 309 pIm developing a sort of infopanel program for a webstream which so far is done by Windows Form, C and it has panels which have labels. Now its very simple what Im doing. At the moment its just hiding  showing panels, changing test in a Window, but I need to create a transition to move the panel out of frame and back with the push of a buttno with lets say 30FPS. Ive tried to google solutions for this but so far Ive only found solutions to use mouse as the vector X,Y point and move items with a mouse and one library here a hrefhttpcode.google.compdotnettransitions relnofollowhttpcode.google.compdotnettransitionsap  pExcept the library doesnt work with a panel that has a background image and a label on top. The panel  label blinks in an out so that the background comes visible for microseconds.

Now is there any other solution for this program I am creating Different programming language, a library, some way One person suggested C and GDI but I have honestly no idea how that would work as its just shapes and I want to use images.p

And so has my sister.p  pTherefore its categorized as a trusted source, since the IP is a static one and each time i access the site, it works for me p  pBUT Lets say i access my account via an unrecognized IP My dads house, then id like the phishing system to enable itself and prevent me from accessing my account until i changed my password.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated p

Negative 309 pI have the following issue I am creating a very big SOAP request the data is a video encoded as Base64 string and because of that I cannot send it as a raw SOAP request but rather need to send it in HTTP 1.1 chunks. I cannot seem to figure out how to do it. I used the code in here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9296221whatarealternativestonsurlconnectionforchunkedtransferencodingWhat are alternatives to NSURLConnection for chunked transfer encodinga but it doesnt seem to be doing what I think it should  I can see that the request arrives on the server as a emsingleem request instead of many chunks I am using WireShark on the server to see the incoming traffic. p  pI know that a similar functionality on an Android works using Apache Foundations HTTP libraries for Java  with these, any HTTP request whose length is not specified in advance is transmitted as an HTTP 1.1 Chunked Request  and I can see indeed those requests arriving on the server as individual chunks...  I want to emulate that.p  pUPDATE Seems to me AFNetworking might have the functionality, but I fail to find any example as to how to use it.p  pHere is my code, more or lessp  precodeNSString soapBody  .... some correctly formed SOAP request XML here    NSURL url  [NSURL URLWithString...] NSMutableURLRequest request  [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURLurl] [request addValue ... forHTTPHeaderFieldSOAPAction] [request setHTTPMethodPOST] [request addValuetextxml forHTTPHeaderFieldContentType] [request setHTTPBody[soapBody dataUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding]] ChunkedTransferConnection connection  [ChunkedTransferConnection alloc] [connection establishConnectionWithRequestrequest] codepre  pwhere ChunkedTransferConnection implementation is the followingp  precodeimplementation ChunkedTransferConnection      synthesize pconnection     synthesize presponseData       voidestablishConnectionWithRequestNSMutableURLRequest request              self.presponseData  [[NSMutableData alloc] initWithLength0]          self.pconnection  [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequestrequest delegateself startImmediatelyYES]      ... end codepre

Negative 309 pHow do I use JavaScript inc JQuery to get a Date object that represents the next instance of 1100p  pMy example is that if the current time is 1500 on a Monday 2nd June, Id want to return 1100 Tuesday 3rd June. Likewise if the current date is 915 Thursday 5th June, Id want to return 1100 Thursday 5th June. So it should return the next instance of 1100 based on the current datetime.p  pThis is for a countdown to shipping cutoff which is 1100 each week day on an ecommerce site. p  pLong term Id like to also exclude weekends, for example if the current date is 0900 on Saturday 7th June, it would return 1100 Monday 9th June, but that is not my primary question for now.p

Negative 309 pIm learning to program in Java and Im wondering if there is a simple way to set a return point in a method in case a user decides they want to go back. For example, within a method, I ask the user to choose between one of three optionsp  p1 Registerp  p2 Searchp  p3 Otherp  pLets say that the user chooses to register. This choice then presents them with two new optionsp  p1 Register as Userp  p2 Register as Adminp  pLets say that they choose to register as an admin. They are then prompted to enter their information, but maybe halfway through they realize Wait I want to register as a user, not an admin. Typing in back is also an option, and if they do so, I want to be able to take them back to the menu where they choose between user and admin, not all the way back to the beginning. Is there a way to do this I know I could use loops, but my program is a bit more complicated than my example, so I would rather not if I can get around it. Im looking for a way similar to the way you can name loops in assembly language, so that you can just say go to this point and it goes back without the user having to reenter all the information that they did before the sub menu that they want to get to. I realize that in my example they dont enter any info until that sub menu. In my actual program they do.p  pAny ideas If worse comes to worse, Im not opposed to using a loop. Just figured I would askp  pThanks so muchp

Negative 309 pIm working on an ASP.net mvc project in Visual Studio 2012. Came across this issue, which is incredibly annoying when debugging my application. Say that I have n number of files open in my editor whenever I build and start a debugsession using F5. Ok, so the editor closes all the open documents as usual, and I do my debuggig tasks. Now when I stop debugging and want to reopen the files that I had open earlier, Im not allowed to do so. Nothing whatsoever happens when I click these files, until I restart VS2012.p  pIf I close all of my open documents before debugging, opening them after works fine and the way its supposed to. Also, this is the case for all of my new or existing projects. I run with ReSharper 7.1.2 installed. Has anyone encountered this issue beforep

Negative 309 pI am looking to get more control over the validation process of liferay aui components so that i can put in some custom code to handle things such as error event tracking for web analytics.  This question is related to my earlier question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16401634howcanliferayalloyuivalidationerrorbecapturedforwebanalyticshow can liferay alloy ui validation error be captured for web analyticsa.  After some more research i have discovered that custom javascript validators can be implemented using the codeauivalidatorcode tag but what i would need is a way to delegate the validation to the original javascript handle, a kind of a codesupercode call so to speak.  This would ensure that i would be able to leverage all the existing validation functionality existing within aui while being able to add my own logic for analytics.. Admittedly, this is not preferable as i would have to put in this logic in a lot of places in every JSP but at least i will have a solution for what essentially is a critical blocker for me right now.p  pI am keeping this as a separate question as this question is more pointed towards custom validations and a lot of people looking at this even for things other than web analytics would find this useful.p  pLooking forward to some guidance from the community...p

Negative 309 pI know that Intel Fortran has libraries with functions and subroutines for working with sparse matricies, but Im wondering if there is also some sort of data type or automated method for creating the sparse matricies in the first place.p  pBACKGROUND  I have a program that uses some 3 amp 4 dimensional arrays that can be very large in the first 2 dimensions 10k to 100k elements in each dimension, maybe more.  In the first 2 dimensions, each array is mostly 95 or so populated w zeroes.  To make the program friendly to machines with a normal amount of RAM available, Id like to convert to sparse matricies.  The manner in which the current conventional arrays are handled amp updated throughout the code is pretty dependent on the code application, so Im looking for a way to convert to sparse matrix storage without significant modification to the code.  Basically, Im lazy, and I dont want to revise the entire memory management implementation or write an entire new module where my arrays live and are managed.  Is there a library or something else for Fortran that would implement a data type or something so that I can use sparse matrix storage without reengineering each array and how it is handled  Thanks for the help.  Cheers.p

Negative 309 pIt has been quite a while since understanding Matrix calculations and mapping them to expected results.  Its sort of intimidating.  Curious if there is anyone out there who have done mapping from an ImageView Matrix codeandroid.graphics.Matrixcode to an openGL Matrix android.opengl.Matrix in order to update the texture based upon the image behind it.p  pThere will always be a photograph directly behind the texture, and the texture in front should stay at the same scale and translation as the ImageView actually using the ImageTouchView library.  The ImageView scaling and zooming works as expected and desired.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUewgZ.png altOrder of the layout for the projectp  pSo, while the Image is being resized, I want to update the OpenGL ES 2.0 shader code in the project such that it changes size with it.  I thought that I would be able to do this by using callbacks and directly manipulating the shader code, but it doesnt seem to be working.  Not sure if this is a shader problem or a direct Matrix passing problem.  The trigger is reached from the ImageTouchView when a matrix change is detected.p  precodeOverride public void onMatrixChangedMatrix matrix      photoViewRenderer.updateTextureMatrixmatrix     photoSurfaceView.requestRender  codepre  pWhen I receive that matrix data and attempt to display the new matrix in the texture then, I get a black screen overtop of the ImageTouchView.  So, this could very well just be an OpenGL problem in the code.  However, this is what it looks like so as we can see exactly what is being described.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV7Yjb.png altWhat happens to the texture when implementing a matrix over it in Shader code.p  pThe shader code looks something like this.  And Ill start with these and add additional code as requested based upon feedback.p  precodeprivate final String vertexShader              uniform float zoomn              attribute vec4 apositionn              attribute vec4 atexCoordn              attribute vec3 atranslationn              varying vec2 vtexCoordn              void main n                glPosition  aposition  vec4atranslation, 1.0n                vtexCoord  atexCoord.xy  zoomn              n codepre  pBefore adding in the line for codevec4atranslation, 1.0code it seemed be working as expected in that the image was being displayed directly on top of the ImageTouchView of equal size just fine.  So it is probably the shader.  But...I cannot rule out that the data going in from an Image Matrix is screwing up the texture either and representing it way off screen.  I dont know what to use as a default matrix for codeatranslationcode in to check against that.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe black screen is actually not an issue now.  The default codeapositioncode set to codeprivate float[] positionTranslationData  1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0fcode brought the image back.  But the texture is not getting manipulated with the inputs from the codeonMatrixChangedMatrix matrixcode function called in by the ImageTouchView. p

Negative 309 pI have installed New Relic on my live instance on AWS . New Relic identifies correctly the drupal modules and also the mysql database.  On my environment there is a drupal module that connects with an external DB hosted on another machine. I would like to see the data on new relic for this connection and to be able to drill down to the messages exchanged within this specific module. New Relic only identifies this module and I can see the data from this module as a whole but I cant see the data related to the database connection. I am not sure if this is possible but I appreciate any king of thoughts, ideas or solutions. NewRelic is doing wonders for me but this would be a major breakthrough for the project I am running as this module is a legacy piece which as several files encrypted and I would like to have as much data as possible from it to be able to analyze the performance of DB and also be able to have a scaling strategy for the future. Note that the external DB is a RAIMA DB . p

It creates a form with eyes , phone and city.p  pWhen I save the form, I save a single record into the codeUSERMETAcode table for each data item. So when registering, I get 3 insertsp  precode  insert into USERMETAuid,name,value values 5,eyes,brown   insert into USERMETAuid,name,value values 5,phone,5551212   insert into USERMETAuid,name,value values 5,city,San Francisco codepre  pNow, I want to write a Stored Procedure that will return a record like thisp  precodeEXECUTE GetMeta 5 codepre  preturnsp  precodeuid   email    eyes  phone  city 5    xx.com    brown   5551212  San Francisco codepre  pI could write a long hard coded select statement likep  precodeDECLARE UID int SELECT  id, email,   select value from USERMETA  where uid  UID and name  EYES as EYES, select value from USERMETA  where uid  UID and name  PHONE as PHONE, select value from USERMETA  where uid  UID and name  CITY as CITY, FROM  USER  where id  UID codepre  pBut that kind of defeats the whole purpose, and I have to write it again every week whenever the metadata requirements change eg when we launch another instance.p  pI would like to have something like this forgive me I am not very experienced with Advanced SQL, so maybe this is easy and I just dont know how to do it I will write it in basic code terms to try and explain my thinkingp  precodeDECLARE UID int DECLARE METANAMES array METANAMES  select NAME from METADATA  SELECT  id, email,    for each METANAMES as THISNAME     select value from USERMETA    where uid  UID and name  THISNAME as THISNAME,   FROM  USER  where id  UID codepre  pIs there a way to write this in SQL Server 2008p

Negative 309 pSo in my project I have javascript iterating through a set of radio buttons. First it checks to see if the selected button in the nameset has been changed, then if it has been, it records the value of the newly selected button for that row, appending it to a variable codedataStringcode, before moving on to the next buttonset. This is all well and good, it collects all the data perfectly. I run into issues when I try to send that data through AJAX, however.p  pFor each row that is changed, I append a coderowNamecode variable and a codedeviceNamecode variable do codedataStringcode. Ideally I want to send these such that when I get the data to Python, I end up with a coderowNamecode list and a codedeviceNamecode list, as happens when you send multiple variables of the same name.p  pMy AJAX call is as followsp  precodevar call .ajax     type POST,     url httplocalhostcgibinsavestate.py,     data dataString .donefunction      document.getElementByIdupper.innerHTMLcall.responseText  codepre  pAs I said, the data I need to send gets collected well enough. Right now, codedataStringcode is formatted so that it looks like thisp  precoderowName firstRowName, deviceName firstDeviceName, rowName secondRowName, deviceName secondDeviceName codepre  pI have also tried changing the AJAX call so that the codedatacode call looks likep  precodedata dataString codepre  pAnd formatted codedataStringcode to look likep  precoderowName firstRowName, deviceName firstDeviceName, rowName secondRowName, deviceName secondDeviceName codepre  pEither way I try to send it, the data does not get to the python script. When I return the data from Python, it comes out asp  precodeFieldStorageNone, None, [] codepre  pNow since the format of the codedatacode attribute in the AJAX call is codekeyname value, etccode, is it possible to send the data in a premade list in that format, or do I have to change the way Ive formatted codedataStringcode and send it some other wayp

Right now, the difference between the stuff with blitz and my first method are not big enough to really be caused by C vs numpy i guess p  pI guess the other methods like with deltas... can go much faster too, when i would put it in C  p

Negative 309 pC11 introduced an a hrefhttpwww.stroustrup.comC11FAQ.htmlgcabiinterface to garbage collectorsa. From what I see, it provides a standardized way to communicate with the GC e.g. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee410585.aspxdeclarenopointersa, and to get information about how disguised pointers are handled e.g., a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee410608.aspxgetpointersafetya.p  pHowever, there is no standardized way in C11 yet to allocate a raw block of memory, which you dont have to free manually. There are use cases where that would help, even if destructors are not called. One example is to implement efficient concurrent data structures as mentioned by Herb Sutter without having to deal with complicated cleanup protocols.p  pSo far, so good. My question from the perspective of an ordinary develper, not a GC library developerp  pstrongIs there a realworld example where the new C11 GC interface has helped youstrongp  pAt least from my perspective the world has not changed. If you need GC, you still have to find a nonstandard library, for example a hrefhttpwww.hpl.hp.compersonalHansBoehmgcBoehm GCa, and learn how to integrate and use it. The new standardized interface wont help very much in that respect. It will also not solve portability issues.p  pIn the long term, the common interface defined by the C11 standard hopefully pays off. However, my question targets only the immediate future.p

As pointed out on this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6009078removingunusedstringsduringproguardoptimisationRemoving unused strings during ProGuard optimisationap  pThere someone one has suggested Ant could be used with a replace algorithm but this wipes out the code when it is run.

Negative 309 pId like to store about 100 to 1000 different relations of type codeltObject A, Relation R, Object Bgtcode in a set or multiset. Id like to be able to search for codeAcode and codeA,Rcode, but not for codeA,R,Bcode and there will be only a few lt5 relations with the same codeAcode and codeRcode, so linear search if fine then.p  pIs it better to store the relations in a set ordered by codeAcode, codeRcode and codeBcode or to store them in a multiset ordered by codeAcode and codeRcodep  pEdit Ive looked into hash tables, but their iteration isnt as fast as ordered set iteration, and the pattern matching requires a lot of iteration too.

Negative 309 pWhen dealing with a codeUICollectionViewcode in my app Ive ran into a strange problem related to reloading data. After lots of debugging and analyzing logs Ive come to the conclusion that if codereloadDatacode is immediately followed by codeinsertItemsAtIndexPathscode the dreaded error below is guaranteed to occurp  blockquote   pName codeNSInternalInconsistencyExceptioncode Reason Invalid update invalid   number of items in section 0. The number of items contained in an   existing section after the update 1 must be equal to the number of   items contained in that section before the update 1, plus or minus   the number of items inserted or deleted from that section 1 inserted   ...p blockquote  pThey only way for this to happen consistently is that internally the codeUICollectionViewcode is still busy with codereloadDatacode when the call to codeinsertItemsAtIndexPathscode arrives. The fact that codecollectionViewnumberOfItemsInSectioncode is called twice in a row before the codeinsertItemsAtIndexPathscode completes seems to support this since that method is never called twice in a row in call other cases. p  pHas anyone seen similar behavior or can confirm my analysis or even suggest a proper workaroundp  pstrongUpdatestrong Any yes Ive made sure that all relevant invocations occur on the main thread.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Since the reasoning behind getting into this situation at all has been questioned Im using Monotouch and the code in question is intended to keep generic .Net Collections firing a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.specialized.notifycollectionchangedaction.aspx relnofollowthis eventa into the appropriate calls to keep the UICollectionView bound to the collection in sync. When the source collection is cleared it reacts with a emResetem action, followed by one or more emAddem actions when items get inserted into it which leads to the problem outlined above.

Negative 309 pIm sure this question is easily googleable, but I cant seem to find the right query to find the answer I want.p  pIm running several apps on my home server that all serve their own website for admin and info purposes. Currently I access them all from the internet using a hrefhttpMyHouseServerAddress.com8080 relnofollowhttpMyHouseServerAddress.com8080a etc. Where 8080 is replaced with 8081, 8082 etc. for each app. They all have their own usernames and passwords and some of them use SSLp  pWhat I want is to have a single access point, e.g. a hrefhttpMyHouseServerAddress.com relnofollowhttpMyHouseServerAddress.coma which gives me access to each app. Each app will have a link on that page which will take you to that apps website as if it were just a page on the main site. However... I want the single access point to be password protected and SSLd, BUT I want to remove the passwords from all the apps as they would be accessed through the single portal of the initial page which is password protected and SSLd. I.e. each app would still serve on its original port, but that port would no longer be accessible via the internet, instead any traffic from that port would be routed through the single access point.p  pWhat Im trying to do it get a single password login, preferably via SSL to my home server which gives me access to all my other serving apps but also secures them all behind the single login.p  pCan this be done with a python script or a C app for instance running some sort of proxy or port forward script Or would running an Appache server that can redirect traffic through itself work Im happy to write code to solve the problem if needed.p  pI hope this makes sensep  pIm running W7 on my home server.p  pThanks, Maxp

Negative 309 pSometimes it may be useful to encode dependency between types of keys and values in a map. Consider the following typep  precodetype MyPairs  Seq[TypeTag[T], T forSome type T] codepre  pHere each pair in the sequence should have the same type codeTcode. But such type is not very convenient in terms of maplike usage. However I cannot express such dependency for codeMap[K, V]code, because codeMapcode has two independent type parameters, and it seems I cannot group them in any way to use single existential type. Naive variantp  precodetype MyMap  Map[TypeTag[T], T] forSome type T codepre  pjust forces the single type codeTcode. for all codeMyMapcode entries, but not for each one of them individually.p  pAnother extreme, I believe, isp  precodetype MyMap  Map[TypeTag[], ] codepre  pBut this is, of course, too broad definition which allows any combination of keyvalue types.p  pSo my question is, it is possible to encode such type in Scala If yes, howp

Negative 309 pI am new to Magento and I have a question about products import. I have the xls file with over 9K positions products wich I need to import. For each product in this file there are basically sku, name, price and descriprion attributes. I am familiar with the basics of importexport in Magento. Ive already exported some test products into csv file to get the structure for import csv. This file of course contains much more attributes than the one i need to import. So my obvious question is how can I create valid import csv from my xls file not by hand of course The only solution I can see right now is to write some php code that will extract data from the xls file, add required attributes from export csv and save it as csv. Are there other solutions to my problem Sorry if I am asking some obviuos questions. Googled, searched, found nothing.p

Negative 309 pI have a javascript logging utility that sends requests in bulk to my server which then relays them to a Queue Client codeMicrosoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.QueueClientcode. I want to send them in batch asynchronously to the ServiceBus and still have them processed in the order they are placed into the batch I am sending. The documentation for codeSendBatchAsynccode shows that the method is for batch processing. This makes me think I can send it a batch of requests and have them processed as a single unit i.e. sequentially. Although, it appears that the messages are getting processed out of order. Im using codeOnMessagecode to receive the messages Im not sure if this is a limitation or what am I missing p  pI get that async doesnt guarantee order vs. other async requests, but this is a single request. I dont want to have to wait for a response before responding to the javascript client as Im just trying to send them off, but I still need to ensure they stay in order since they are sequential events. p  pHere is how I send them to the queuep  precodeMyQueueClient.SendBatchAsyncMyListOfBrokerMessages codepre  pThen I process themp  precode        ServiceBus.TrackerClient.OnMessagem gt                      try                              ProcessMessagem              codepre  pI dont get the point of the batch processing if it doesnt process as a batch other than maybe making a single request.

Negative 309 pIm working with a web server project that performs a codeforkcode without an codeexeccode. The program depends upon OpenSSL, and OpenSSL needs a number of locks codeCRYPTONUMLOCKScode to be exact, which is about 40 at the moment. The locks are typically codepthreadmutextcode on Linux, and they are installedcreated on the main thread before any threads are created.p  pcodeforkcode creates a new process. However, after the codeforkcode, the handles used in the mutex are shallow copied. That is, they have the same bits but I dont believe they have a useful value in the context of the new process.p  pI think the general problem is that of thread and fork safety in a shared object. The a hrefhttpwiki.openssl.org relnofollowOpenSSL wikia page on codelibcryptocode discusses a hrefhttpwiki.openssl.orgindex.phpLibcryptoAPIForkSafety relnofollowthread and fork safetya, and Im not sure how to address some of the problems.p  pIs there a way to specify that a library such as OpenSSL should be reinitialized on codeforkcodep

This traffic is then decrypted with the server certificate on the server end.p  pBut is this the way it will work The way it is configurated now, the certificate is specified on the IIS listening port only, so will it generate a certificate for the client based on the server certificate for each request Or will the traffic from the client go unencryptedp  pI tried running fiddler on my requests and enabled decrypting HTTPS, and noticed I could read the username and password in plain text in the XML.

So, which snippet would be considered more faithful to the front controller pattern  passing the config from codeFrontControllercode down, or supplying the config directly to the classesp  pAs I am new to Java, I am trying to learn servlets without using a framework for the time being.p

Were solving this by replacing the dropdown with currency icons.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pI think Ive worked out the cause of the first issue i.e. being redirected to a random page.

Negative 309 pI am a beginner in database design, researching ways in which to implement a timeseries data. Basically, I want to design a database that store battery metrics i.e. current, voltage and the time for users.  The more I think about it, the more I start to confuse myself. Please help me to point in the rieght direction. So far, I come up with the following psuedocodep  precode   Table User     Column 1 UserID Primary Key      Column 2 UserName      Table Battery      Column 1 BatteryID   Primary Key      Column 2 ManufactureSerial     Column 3 ManufactureDate     Column 4 UserID Foreign Key       Table BatteryLog     Column 1 Voltage      Column 2 Current      Column 3 SOC      Column 4 DateTime      Column 5 BatteryID Foreign Key codepre  pNow, my question is what should be the primary key for BatteryLog table A batterylog can contain millions of TimeSeries rows at a specified time internal. I am using SqlServer relational database now. Is there a optimization design for it p  pThank you for your help in my researchp
Negative 309 pI have been now two years working deeply with Qt layout system. After this time i encountered thosand of problems with SizePolicies and Layouts. I normally found out solutions, but never really understood what i was doing.p  pNow i was taking some time to try to understand correctly and build a 101 GUIDE for them and never fail. I found out this piece of information in the documentation about QSizePolicy of a QWidgetp  blockquote   pThis property holds the default layout behavior of the widgetp      pIf there is a QLayout that manages this widgets children, the size   policy specified by that layout is used. If there is no such QLayout,   the result of this function is used.p blockquote  pI thought that if you had a QLabel, for example, and you set the policies to Horizontal Expanding, Vertical Fixed, THE LABEL itself changed that way. But it doesnt, at all.p  pWhen reading that i see that it talks about ITS CHILDREN inside the LAYOUT. So what does it mean, then. Nothing is inside the label, is that why it does not work.p  pWHat about inserting a label inside a QFrame, and telling the frame to be Expanding... Will the QFrame expand or stretch depending on the rest of brother widgets in the same Layout or will the label expand or stretch, not the QFramep  pWhat a mess...p  pWhat about Stretching. If you set stretching 10 when you add the widgetp  precodelayoutgtaddwidgetlabel, 10, QtAlignHCenter codepre  pIt doesnt work either.p  pStretch 0 when you add the widget means  Take the policies i told you. Default, depends on the type of widget. Buttonlike widgets have expandingfixed. Boxlike ExpandingExpanding... p  pStretch 10 means grow maximum.p  pAm i right Well. When having a QFrame and a QLabel inside, setting Expanding, and 10 to strech to the label DOES NOT WORK.p

I have tried to use the following aggregation query, but cant figure out how to get it working since the EQ operator used along with COND doesnt seem to evaluate data inside of an array always false.p  precodedb.collection.aggregate[              project               id  0,             firstName  1,             lastName 1,             issourcea                   cond  [                      eq [ source.type, sourcea ] ,                     1,                     0                 ]             ,             issourceb                   cond  [                      eq [ source.type, sourceb ] ,                     1,                     0                 ]                            ] codepre  pI could UNWIND the array first, but then I wind up with a multiple records for each user document and dont understand how to consolidate them back.p  pIs there something that Im missing with how to use EQ or some other operator along with COND when dealing with arrays of objectsp
Negative 309 pI need some advice on a website design, if and how this could be realized.p  pOK, the client imagines to have a singleone page responsive website with a 3 colum desktop layout like thisp  pp  pWhere the center colum shall scroll while the rest stays in place. The left colum shall furthermore contain some kind of a nav menu, while the right one contains contact info.p  pIm fairly experienced but I cannot think of a responsive solution in HTMLCSS as this would mean the center colum would have to be outside of the codeltbodygtcode.p  pSo to me, the only realistic thing is some jsbased solution similar to those floating social media panels. p  pPlease share your thoughts on this.

Negative 309 pI am doing a school project in which my team has to ensure consistency and integrity of data, as well as to improve performance for a trading website. The website is coded in JSP and JAVA. We are also using MySQL and its ndb cluster for our project.p  pFirstly, I have done experiments on prepared statements with load test of 100, 175 and 250 virtual users. The results show that reusing prepared statements improves response time and throughput. By improvement, I meant that average response time decreases and maximum throughput increases. p  pSecondly, I have also done experiments using connection pool with the same load test of 100, 175 and 250 virtual users. Similarly, the results show an improvement in performance. Just an additional information, I used c3p0 for the connection pool.p  pWith these results, I am planning to use prepared statements and connection pool for the trading website. At the same time, we would also use transactions to ensure consistency and integrity of data.p  pCurrently, the way that I have implemented prepared statements and transaction are as followsp  precodepublic class ExchangeBean  private PreparedStatement psSelectFromBuy  null private PreparedStatement psSelectFromSell  null private PreparedStatement psInsertBuy  null private PreparedStatement psInsertSell  null private Connection tranDbConnection  null  public ExchangeBean      reusePreparedStatements   public void reusePreparedStatements      tranDbConnection  DbBean.getDBConnection     dbConnection.setAutoCommitfalse       try          psSelectFromBuy  dbConnection.prepareStatementSELECT  FROM buy WHERE stock   FOR UPDATE         psSelectFromSell  dbConnection.prepareStatementSELECT  FROM sell WHERE stock   FOR UPDATE         psInsertBuy  tranDbConnection.prepareStatementINSERT INTO buy userid, date, price, stock VALUES , , ,          psInsertSell  tranDbConnection.prepareStatementINSERT INTO sell userid, date, price, stock VALUES , , ,       catch Exception e         public boolean buysome parameters      try          selectFromBuy a method that contains psSelectFromBuy         psInsertBuy.clearParameters         psInsertBuy.setInt1, buy.getUserId         psInsertBuy.setLong2, buy.getDate.getTime         psInsertBuy.setInt3, buy.getPrice         psInsertBuy.setString4, buy.getStock         psInsertBuy.executeUpdate          some other codes         psInsertBuy.commit      catch Exception e          dbConnection.rollback        public boolean sellsome parameters      try          selectFromSell a method that contains psSelectFromSell         psInsertSell.clearParameters         psInsertSell.setInt1, sell.getUserId         psInsertSell.setLong2, sell.getDate.getTime         psInsertSell.setInt3, sell.getPrice         psInsertSell.setString4, sell.getStock         psInsertSell.executeUpdate          some other codes         psInsertSell.commit      catch Exception e          dbConnection.rollback        codepre  pemNote This code sample is incomplete for brevitys sake quite a fair bit of the codes and logic not in it.emp  pSo basically, my approach is to declare the prepared statements as class variables and then instantiate them when the class is being called the very first time.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol lipIs my approach correct I feel that it is not exactly correct because all my prepared statements are tied to one connection. I am worried that if multiple users try to buy and sell at the same time, there may be issues since only one connection is used. However, I cannot close the connection else my prepared statements would be closed after each deal and hence would not be reused. Furthermore, when I commit, all the prepared statements involved in the transaction should be committed together and hence it would be easier if I only used one connection.pli lipDo you have any suggestions on how I should use connection pooling with prepared statements and transactions I was thinking of caching all the prepared statements into the connection each time it is created from the pool. When the connection is being used for buy or sell, the method itself will disable auto commit on that connection and enable auto commit again at the end of the method. Would this approach be appropriate Or should I have two connection pools one for nontransaction connections and one for transaction connectionspli ol  pThanksp

Negative 309 pI have read an interesting post online where a google employee discusses that Google would not benefit from Erlangs supervision model because they have built an equivalent supervision model into their infrastructurep  blockquote   pfull disclosure I work at google and also like erlang Erlang has fantastic facilities   for robustness and concurrency. What it does not have is type safety   and its terrible at handling text in a performant fashion. So if you   dont care about either of those things and only care about robustness   and concurrency then Erlang is great. There were internal discussions   about Erlang here but the upshot was. We had already basically   duplicated Erlangs supervision model in our infrastructure, only we   did it for all languages and Erlang didnt offer any benefits in   performance for us.p      pstrongSourcestrong a hrefhttperlang.orgpipermailerlangquestions2013August075135.htmlhttperlang.orgpipermailerlangquestions2013August075135.htmlap blockquote  pDespite searching online, I cannot find any information on their supervision model it is most probable that Im searching using the wrong search terms.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liWhat is the architecture of Googles supervision model li liFor many of Googles published innovations, there has later followed open source software that provides the same functionality e.g. Google BigTable  HBase, MapReduce  Hadoop, etc.  Does a hrefhttptechblog.netflix.com201204introducingexhibitorsupervisorsystem.htmlNetflixs Exhibitora perform all the roles one would expect of the google supervision infrastructure mentioned in the above quoteli ol  hr  pstrongNotestrong Ive tried to make this question stackoverflow friendly.

Negative 309 pI am learning Prolog via a hrefhttpwww.learnprolognow.org relnofollowhttpwww.learnprolognow.orga and I am having some trouble understanding how to recursively build up a variable with results from another recursive call, as per Practical Session 3.4, question 3.  The initial problem is a straightforward recursive call to determine if a route is feasible.  But the followon problem asks you to show the actual path to get to the end of the route.p  pWe are given the following knowledge base of travel informationp  precodebyCarauckland,hamilton.  byCarhamilton,raglan.  byCarvalmont,saarbruecken.  byCarvalmont,metz. byTrainmetz,frankfurt.  byTrainsaarbruecken,frankfurt.  byTrainmetz,paris.  byTrainsaarbruecken,paris. byPlanefrankfurt,bangkok.  byPlanefrankfurt,singapore.  byPlaneparis,losAngeles.  byPlanebangkok,auckland.  byPlanesingapore,auckland.  byPlanelosAngeles,auckland.  codepre  blockquote   pWrite a predicate travel2 which determines whether it is possible to   travel from one place to another by chaining together car, train, and   plane journeys.

If you are planning   such a voyage, thats already something useful to know, but you would   probably prefer to have the precise route from Valmont to Raglan.   Write a predicate travel3 which tells you which route to take when   travelling from one place to another. For example, the program should   respondp blockquote  precodeX    govalmont,metz,gometz,paris,goparis,losAngeles codepre  blockquote   pto the query travelvalmont,losAngeles,Xp blockquote  pI have been struggling to populate X with a series of goFrom,To that show the successive steps of the journey.  It looks like a recursive problem but I do not know how one should go about tackling it.  This technique seems fundamental to Prolog programming, and I am quite interested in the thinking process to solve this problem and I look forward to any insight you can provide.p
Negative 309 pIm working on a small multiplayer 2D XNA Game using TCP. My issue is that when more than 2 people connect everyone starts to lag out.

This ultimately sends a massive amount of packets which I think causes the issue Im having.p  pIs it normal to send every x,y coordinate to every player or am I doing something wrongp

Negative 309 pI am using the Ratchet.jspush.js library to create the UI for a mobile web app. In this library, links are handled by pushing the tobeloaded file into the .content DOM element rather than loading the entire page. However, push.js does not load any scripts it finds when loading a page  which disables my Knockout.js code.  p  pI found a solution here on StackOverflow that works pretty well  just add an event listener for the push event.  I modified it so that it can load any script across multiple pages and so it works with external script filesp  precodewindow.addEventListenerpush, function     var scriptsList  document.querySelectorAllscript.jscustom   Add a jscustom class to your script tag   for var i  0 i lt scriptsList.length i         Handle scripts in separate files by assigning the script file name to its id.        We save it in a variable because the .done callback is asynchronous.       scriptName  scriptsList[i].id   IMPORTANT Only one loadable script per page       .getScriptpath info here  scriptName         .donefunction script, textStatus              evalscript                   ... error handling ...     codepre  pIn the target HTML page, scripts are given class and id tags so they work with the above p  precode    ltscript srcChallenge.js classjscustom idchallenge.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pNote, too, that Knockout bindings have to occur to a specific named DOM element so that knockout doesnt get confused p  precodeko.cleanNodeChallengePage[0] ko.applyBindingschallengeFn,  ChallengePage[0] codepre  pWe use cleanNode to avoid the already bound errors.p  pOK  So all this works great and I hope that someone who is struggling with this finds it useful.p  pHOWEVER, when the link is given a transitionp  precodelta hrefchallenge.html datatransitionslideingt.... codepre  pThen it breaks with a Cannot read property nodeType of undefined.  I had thought that maybe it was just a problem of waiting for the transition to finish, but even if I replace the eval of the script with p  precodescriptContents  script setTimeoutfunction   evalscriptContents , 1000 codepre  pit doesnt help.p  pAny advice or assistance would be greatly appreciated  I dont really need to push pages if I dont get to use the transitions so I am hoping that someone will have the last key to making this all workp  pUPDATE The error was occurring because the document.querySelectorAll call when using a transition uses the emcurrentem document rather than the document being pushed.  Also, using webkitTransitionEnd as my event works as well but this doesnt fix the document issue.  Thus, I can make this work, but only for a single transition  now I dont have a way of getting the document being loaded.  Ideally, a solution that works whether a links uses a transition or not is what I am looking for.p

Negative 309 pIm using a container with a width of 960 which holds a bunch of photos. Some pics are vertical and some are horizontal.

Negative 309 pTo automate my app, I need to pass some parameters to the built IPA as I deploy it on various devices and run my automation. From various threads I figured I can use iosdeploy a hrefhttpsgithub.comphonegapiosdeploy relnofollowhttpsgithub.comphonegapiosdeploya, a project forked from the fruitstrap project, to successfully deploy an IPA to device via the command line on my terminal. Although iosdeploy documentation suggests it has an option to provide arguments to pass to the app when launching it by using codeacode or codeargscode, it didnt quite work for me. Rather I am not sure how to read these arguments inside the app. I have tried reading from code[[NSProcessInfo processInfo] arguments]code as well as NSUserDefaults method a hrefhttpperspx.comarchivesparsingcommandlineargumentsnsuserdefaults relnofollowhttpperspx.comarchivesparsingcommandlineargumentsnsuserdefaultsa and neither are reading the arguments that I am sending to the IPA via codeiosdeploy acode. These methods work fine if I am building app on XCode and sending arguments Edit SchemeRunArgumentsArguments passed on launch.p  pCan someone who has used iosdeploy provide an example on how to use the codeacode option Or Is there any other way to launch an IPA after passing arguments to a device on the CLI.p

Negative 309 pTLDR always remember that stdvector needs to move your data around when it grows, which invalidates any pointers you still have floating around.p  pIve googled around for this problem a bit, and it seems every case I came across was a question of calling delete on the same pointer twice.  Im writing a small program and Im getting heap corruption, but the only thing doing heap allocation is the c standard library.

Negative 309 pIm trying to have the projects within my workspace to reference each other directly, instead of the jar files from the maven repo. That used to work perfectly fine when having all the projects in the same folder eclipse workspace and using codemvn installcode and codemvn eclipseeclipsecode.

Negative 309 pThis might sound like a stupid question, but I am about to implement a custom security database and framework for a new site.

Negative 309 pTrying to get a function to output the result of a variable once all of it asynch processes have been completed. To do this Ive learned that I have to use promises and so Ive spent the day learning about them. p  pIve written my function with promises and have looked at many tutorials but I am still getting this error, not sure what I am doing wrong.

Negative 309 pIve recently a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq4710084398670encountered Property Sheetsa in Visual Studio, which provide a way to define user defined codeMACROcodes for a project. Theyre not  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq25804860398670what I really wanta but are the closest I can find in VS so far.p  pHowever, under the property manager View  Other Windows  Property Manager it doesnt seem to be possible to get the User Macros section of the configuration editor to show up unless you edit a specific configurationplatform combo, like codeDebug  Win32code.p  pIf you have quite a few configurations and want to say set a macro to the same value for all configurations on the same platform, this gets cumbersome fast.p  pWhen editing project properties normally you can select All Configurations andor All Platforms to have changes copied to subsections. This isnt available when editing a property sheet.p  pIs there any way to set values in a property sheet for multiple configurationsplatforms at once Consider, for example, that you want to set a macro codePOSTGRESINSTALLcode to codePROGRAMFILESPostgreSQL9.3code for x64 targets and codePROGRAMFILESx86PostgreSQL9.3code for x86 targets, is there any way to do that for multiple targets Debug, Release, SomeCustomTarget at the same timep

I can see the camera view from one device in the other device. I would like to use that view in the receiving android device in order to create the augmented reality experience. Because there is not a widely used of such a technique, those big AR SDK have not worked for me. I cannot pay for them either. p  pDo anyone know what can I do or if you can point me to a tutorial that deals with this issue I obtained the bitmap from the server device and send everything through IPUDP packages to the other devices. p  pAny helpp  pThanks.p

Negative 309 pIm trying to implement search filtering for a data source that is used to populate a codeUITableViewcode.p  pBasically, Im trying to allow people to put in multiple words and split that one string into tokens and then iterate through each object in the datasource to see if I can find all of the search tokens anywhere in an objects properties or subproperties.p  pIf the user simply types in multiple words separated by spaces, this is a trivial case of using codecomponentsSeparatedByStringcode. p  pIm trying, however, to also solve the case where a user might put in a commaseparated list of items. p  pSo, the easy entry to tokenize is thisp  pword1 word2 word3p  pI want to also be able to tokenize thisp  pword1, word2, word3p  pThe problem I see is that, because I dont assume that the user will enter commas, I cant simply replaceremove white space. p  pI see some kludgy ways to implement what I want, which basically consists of splitting first on white space, then iterating that array, splitting on commas, then iterating the overall array, removing empty tokens. I think this would work, but I was hoping for a more elegant way to do this, especially since I might decide to add a third delimiter at some point, which would make this solution exponentially more complex.p  pSo far, Im intrigued by using codeNSCharacterSetcode in combination with codecomponentsSeparatedByCharactersInSetcode. Im having trouble with this method, though.p  pHeres what Im trying so farp  precodeNSMutableCharacterSet delimiters  [NSMutableCharacterSet characterSetWithCharactersInString,] [delimiters addCharactersInString ] NSArray tokens  [searchText componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSetdelimiters] codepre  pThe problem Im encountering is thisp  pSuppose codesearchTextcode above is word,.

As I call ReleaseDC before the library calls wglGetCurrentDC, this seems to be failing, so in the end I think Im going to have to cache a HDC for each window until it is destroyed and not call ReleaseDC until then.p  pThe question is if the way Im doing things at the moment i.e. releasing a DC which is associated with an OpenGL rendering context before drawing is technically allowed, or a side effect that just seems to workp

Is there anyway I can take a step back and use the old weightsp  pI also see the codeEarlyStoppingStrategycode class which is probably what I need to use by using the codeaddStrategycode method. However, I really dont understand why the codeEarlyStoppingStrategycode constructor takes both the validation set and the test set.

Negative 309 pI have a view which contains a datagrid. Below the datagrid I have some controls to edit the properties of the selected item lets say a manager from the datagrid.p  pSo I have a property that is bound to the datagrid SelectedItemp  pA Manager has for example a property called Name. So when a manager is selected. a textbox below the datagrid has to be bound to the name property I can do this in xaml like thisp  precodeltTextBox TextBinding PathSelectedManager.Name, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged gt codepre  pThe problem is that I like to implement some extra code when the value of SelectedManager.Name changes so I need a property in my ViewModel like thisp  precodeprivate Manager selectedManager public Manager SelectedManager      get  return selectedManager      set              selectedManager  value         RaisePropertyChangedSelectedManager       codepre  pSo when SelectedManager changes this would not update the ManagerName property ofcourse. I have 3 solutions and I would like to know what you think about these or do you have a better way. My solutuions arep  p1 When the SelectedManager is set I can call RaisePropertyChangedstring.Empty This will update all bindings.p  p2 When the SelectedManager is set I can call RaisePropertyChangedManagerName This will update the binding for the specific property but infact Manager contains more properties so I have to do that for every property.p  pI Dont think solution 1 and 2 are clean so solution 3 isp  pCreat an innerclass DetailsViewModel so this basicly a childviewmodel to handle the details properties. Bind the datacontext of the detail controls to an instance of DetailsViewModel. This looks a great solution, but the problem is, I like to access the ParentViewModel from the ChildViewModel, and I dont think passing the ParentViewModel to the ChildViewModel is a good idea.p  pSo what will be cleanest solution, or is there a better way to deal with thisp  pScreenshot of the view a hrefhttpimageshack.comaimg661212xXws6.png relnofollowhttpimageshack.comaimg661212xXws6.pngap
Negative 309 pI wanted to convert my simulation code in Matlab to C and run it with a C compiler such as Visual Studio or g. I modified my code to successfully build a C project using Matlab Coder.  The coder returns a .prj file in the top project directory, and tens or hundreds of c sourceheaderobject files in the dll directory. I tried to open the .prj files with Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 I tried with both versions that was unsuccessful and they cannot even open a .prj file.  I have made sure to configure the Visual Studio as the C language compiler in Matlab using mex setup.  Does anyone have any idea how to handle the .prj and the subsequent files with Visual Studio or g I dont want to make it executable at the moment I just want to run it with either compilers and make sure its working. Thanksp

Negative 309 pIm using node.js with express as a web framework and passport.js for authentication. Furthermore I use an own strategy for the authentication process. p  pstrongpassport.jsstrongp  precodemodule.exports  functionpassport, ws       passport.uselocallogin, new LocalStrategy         usernameField  email,         passwordField  password,         passReqToCallback  true     ,     functionreq, email, password, done          ws.sendsomeLoginData          Get respond from the server here for the authentication process e.g. user object          if user         return donenull, false, req.flashloginMessage, No user found.          if user.validPasswordpassword         return donenull, false, req.flashloginMessage, Wrong password.          return donenull, user            function handleRespondmessage          Callback for ws to parse the respond          This will be out of the original context         return something       codepre  pFor the validation of the input Ive to request a second server using websockets and process the response see codews.sendcode. Now Ive a huge problem to get the response back into the LocalStrategy as shown above. p  pstrongws.jsstrongp  precodefunction start     ws  new WebSocketurl     ws.onopen, function            ws.onmessage, functionmessage          forvar i in clients              Send a message to the client with the message             clients[i].handleRespondmessage                 codepre  pFirst of all the response is handled by the codewscode class with codews.oncode. To pass the response back to the passport class, a list of registered listeners can be used, which calls a special function. But the huge problem with this kind of procedure is the need of a immediately return statement within the strategy and the respond in this function. Now In this example Ive to wait for a method that has to be called out of the normal program flow through the incoming message before I can return the final result of the authentication process. I dont know if this is possible in theory and would moreover end in a solid solution.p  pThe socket between the two servers is also used for updates and any kind of user context.  Im sure that Im not the first one who runs into this scenario. Therefore I hope to get some hints and ideas how to develop the best solution for this scenario.p

Negative 309 pI have inherited a web application that uses MySQL as database.

They are loaded and fired when needed. These queries were designed and certified in cooperation with a lawyers office. They are a valuable asset and while I can debug the code and catch the exact query, I cant modify it. Even if the application features a screen where I can manually edit the text of the 180 queries having a superuser account, when that page loads the query itself is fired for some reason being an editor screen, the query should be only loaded from its table so the application crashes. Finally I dont currently know how many queries are affected by this problem blockquote  h2Changing codelowercasetablenamescode on a production server is not yet an optionh2  pHowever, changing anything at database level is a great option via codeALTER SCHEMAcodecodeALTER DATABASEcode.p  pFor now, my question is can I tell the connection string to temporarily enable codelowercasetablenamescode If not, can I use a different character set current is codelatin1code to have MySQL caseinsensitively compare identifiersp

Negative 309 pI have a function coderesponsivecode that changes behaviour of certain elements on my website, including hiding popups etc. I call it in 2 casesp  precodedocument.readyresponsive window.resizeresponsive codepre  pThe problem occurs on android chrome, as the virtual keyboard actually changes the height of the screen, and triggers coderesponsivecode function, which closes my popups some of them have text fields, making it impossible to type.p  pHow can I prevent this from happening I read somewhere a good point that android virtual keyboard only changes height of the screen, not a width, so I assume it would be a good idea to compare width before and after resize.

Negative 309 pI am trying to create a fault tolerant akkacluster which will be deployed in AWS.

Negative 309 pIm building a Flux app using MartyJS which is pretty close to vanilla Flux and uses the same underlying dispatcher. It contains stores with an inherent dependency relationship. For example, a codeUserStorecode tracks the current user, and an codeInstanceStorecode tracks instances of data owned by the current user. Instance data is fetched from an API asynchronously.p  pThe question is what to do to the state of the codeInstanceStorecode when the user changes.p  pIve come to believe e.g. reading answers by fisherwebdev on SO that its most appropriate to make AJAX requests in the action creator function, and to have an AJAX success result in an action that in turn causes stores to change.p  pSo, to fetch the user i.e. log in, Im making an AJAX call in the action creator function, and when it resolves, Im dispatching a codeRECEIVEUSERcode action with the user as a payload. The codeUserStorecode listens to this and updates its state accordingly.p  pHowever, I also need to refetch all the data in the codeInstanceStorecode if the user is changed.p  pstrongOption 1strong I can listen to codeRECEIVEUSERcode in the codeInstanceStorecode, and if it is a new user, trigger an AJAX request, which in turn creates another action, which in turn causes the codeInstanceStorecode to update. The problem with this is that it feels like cascading actions, although technically its async so the dispatcher will probably allow it.p  pstrongOption 2strong Another way would be for codeInstanceStorecode to listen to change events emitted by codeUserStorecode and do the requestaction dance then, but this feels wrong too.p  pstrongOption 3strong A third way would be for the action creator to orchestrate the two AJAX calls and dispatch the two actions separately. However, now the action creator has to know a lot about how the stores relate to one another.p  pOne of the answers in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26632415whereshouldajaxrequestbemadeinfluxappWhere should ajax request be made in Flux appa makes me think option 1 is the right one, but the Flux docs also imply that stores triggering actions is not good.p

Negative 309 pMy main requirement would be to have a service having its own process and trigger its own geofencing event. Id like the user to be notified from the notification center when he enters a geofence, even if the app is killed.p  pI read about services and this seems pretty clear to me, the Android documentation is dense so I managed to understand how to start a service with its own process, and also how it is able to communicate with the app using Messenger.p  pThen there is this code sample from Google showing how to use geofencing with google play services a hrefhttpsgithub.comgooglesamplesandroidGeofencing relnofollowGoogle samples geofencingap  pWhat I found so far is that we have to use an IntentService to trigger geofencing events, and from the docs Ive read it states that an IntentService terminates itself when its work is done. And I tested a bit also, it looks like the Intentservice gets killed when the app gets killed, which doesnt surprise me regarding the documentation.p  pSo my question is, how could we perform a geofencing service having its own process Is that possible to avoid using IntentService for this matterp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe reason I wanna do this, is that the user can set geofence reminders, it is based on a daily usage. For instance imagine each day you arrive at your workplace, we should be able to fire an alarm or a notification when we enter this geofence regarding the app is running or not. We dont want the user to worry about having the app running in background.p

Negative 309 pI am trying to port an historical functional language interpreter KRC for EMAS to modern systems C for Unix and it has a garbage collector that expects to be able to scan the stack for pointers into the heap to know which pointers it must relocate when objects in the heap are moved during a GC. For this to work, all function arguments and local variables that point into the heap must be found in the stack.p  pNow, there was a time when the register keyword meant you can put this variable in a register if you like and otherwise it was on the stack, but nowadays all GCC, Clang, Tinyctcc C compilers seem to put local variables into registers regardless, with no way to disable this behaviour and the result is that that the GC is missing out on some values belonging to inprogress functions, failing to preserve them and corrupting the heap.p  pIs there a way to tell any of these compilers to use the original C semantics, whereby all local variables are on the stack unless you say registerp  pI have a few warty solutionsp  ul liadding extra code everywhere to take the address of each heaporiented local variable and passing it to a dummy function, as a way of forcing it to be in a memory locationli limaking all static functions global so as to avoid function inlining and the resultant optimisingout of the inlined functions parametersli libracketing the GC function with a stub that pushes all the machine registers onto the stack, calls the real GC function and then pops themli ul  pwhich all seem to improve matters, but are awfully hacky and unreliable.p  pIs there a better way to achieve the required result, of ensuring that all function parameters and local variables will be on the stackp
Negative 309 pBoth machines are running 64 bit versions of Win7. The project has been painfully pieced together, I am not a programmer. p  pThe function of the project is to automatically search emails for attachments upon a reminder set to fire every night and only download attachments to specified pathway that have the string defined by the two pos lines of code. Basically it just checks if the file name contains the desired namephrase. The files I am working with change slightly with every email and over the years, but always contains the one statement. If the mail was unRead, it marks it as read when it is done with all the attachments in each email.p  pThe only other difference is the machine with outlook 2010 does have some other code running on it.

Negative 309 pI am creating a Minesweeper clone for fun w javafx and if anyone has played the original game they might recall that when you press down on a tile and move around, the other tiles behave as if they are also being pressed... and if you let go  the node your mouse is currently over will be clicked even though you originally pressed down on an entirely different node. I am having a hard time recreating this and I need some help.p  pI am using a global event handler class, and Im not really sure if this is good or really bad... however, it feels right to have the events for my clone being handled separately. I have tried using methods on the node which the event occurred, like startFullDrag or startDragAndDrop which I think will allow other events to occur or be used by other nodes I thought by calling these methods on the event origin node it would allow other events to be handled or information to be sent to the end node, but nothing really worked. Before that approach, I tried to handle the events in a nested manner, every approach ends up with the drag event not allowing anything to happen.p  pDoes anybody have any ideas on how I can get this feature implemented...

Negative 309 pI capture video via codeAVCaptureSessioncode in codekCVPixelFormatType420YpCbCr8BiPlanarFullRangecode video format. I cant use another format, I need frames on output for recognition. And I use codeAVAssetWritercode for write frames to file when frames come in. Now I need add watermark to video in most efficient way as it possible. I look to a hrefhttpsgithub.comBradLarsonGPUImage relnofollowcodeGPUImagecodea library. I write test project with little changes in library and get great performance. 1280x720 video recorded in real time with overlay codeUIViewcode without lags.

When I do writing myself, I do not see any lags. I think problem with conversion to RGB and other stuff that codeGPUImagecode do.p  pSo my question isbr Can I add watermark in OpenGL maybe on frame without RGB conversion Or what part in codeGPUImagecode takes more time Can I overlay codeluminanceTexturecode and codechrominanceTexturecode in shaderp

Negative 309 pIm working on a project that requires me to run my code on a remote Unix server, that is not available to connect to directly you first have to log in to the gate node and then  to this server.p  pWhats really bad is that they disabled key authentication, so each time I need to ssh into it, I have to type in my password twice. Its really annoying and I wonder whats the best way to transfer my local modifications of source files to this server, compile and run them without having to provide those passwords so many times.p  pI have no sudo access to any of those servers neither to this gate, nor to this target server. Any ideas on how to make the whole process more efficientp  pEDIT Martin Prikryl provided a great answer below, but its suitable for Windows and Im on a Mac  I guess it might be a good thing to have it documented here also for NIX systems.p

Negative 309 pEM quickshop works fine when having http or https website setting separately, but when using ssl for admin and non ssl for frontend the iframe will have error the contents of this website is not secure. Thanks to Rehan Mobin, the issue was fixed by adding frontname to EMQuickshop module. The access error was gone but only problem left now is adding to cart, once adding products to cart the access error will show up again on reload, but the products does get to be added to cart. This is due to once adding to cart the success notice gets reload to iframe and change to https on the process and somehow is again pulling data from admin end on reload which will return https on iframe and show access error. Anyway to fix this issue so it can work with ssl admin when adding to cart on iframe Thanksp  pI am using Magento 1.9.0.1p  pReference link for the fix for access error But does not fix the add to cart issue.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28992600emquickshophttpandhttpsissuesEm Quickshop http and https issuesap

The result is that one errors out, because its inserting duplicate data and violating a unique constraint.p  pIdeally, Id like to ensure that two connections executing the procedure with the same codeidcode parameter will execute both the codeDELETEcode and codeINSERTcode serially, without locking the entire table. Its also fine if the two procedures are completely serialized, as long as they arent preventing the execution of other invocations with a different parameter.p  pIs there any way I can achieve thisp

Negative 309 pI am trying to get the value in the spinner out of it to check that it was entered correctly through an AutomationElement in C. What I am currently doing is attempting get it out through the codeTryGetCurrentPatterncode as shown below, however it only returns 0.0 for the value despite having a different value such as 1 displayed in the spinner.p  precodeif spinnerAutoEle.TryGetCurrentPatternRangeValuePattern.Pattern, out pattern       var valueRangePattern  RangeValuePatternpattern     return valueRangePattern.Current.Value  codepre  pAlso, I noticed when looking at the codevalueRangePattern.Currentcode the field for maximum and minimum values are always 0.0 as well despite the spinner being limited. I have also tried getting a codeValuePatterncode out of the spinner but it will not go into the if statement codeif spinnerAutoEle.TryGetCurrentPatternValuePattern.Pattern, out patterncode. Is it possible to get the numerical value out of the Spinner in this wayp

Negative 309 pLets say I want to write an app for a company that helps with keeping their papers, policies, or whatever in digital form This app would need to be internal to that particular company as those documents do not need to be released to the world. The company could be big or small, so anywhere for 10 devices to like 10,000 devices. I would I create the app as for that company as freelancer or an outside agent. How would I be able to allow the company use that app without putting it up on the App Store or making it open to the public.p  pI Tried all the solutions available in the internet however i could not install it, the only solution that worked is using the JailBreak, however not all users are using Jailbreak.p

Negative 309 pHow to change from setLineTokenizernew DelimitedLineTokenizer... to JsonLineMapper in the first code below Basicaly, it is working with csv but I want to change it to read a simple json file. I found some threads here asking about complex json but this is not my case. Firstly I thought that I should use a very diferent approach from csv way, but after I read SBiAch05sample.pdf see the link and snippet at the bottom, I understood that FlatFileItemReader can be used to read json format. In a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28563513readcomplexjsonfilewithspringbatchalmost similiar questiona, I can guess that I am not in the wrong direction. Please, I am trying to find the simplest but elegant and recommended way for fixing this snippet code. So, the wrapper below, unless I am really obligated to work this way, seems to go further.

Negative 309 pThis is not so much a howto question, as a question about how python functions to store variables.p  pAs far as I understand please correct me if i am wrong, when a variable is created in say C, the value is stored in memory and the address of that memory is stored under the variable name. In python it creates the value in memory, and then tags that memory address with the variable name. So that if you do thisp  precodegtgtgt x  3 gtgtgt y  x gtgtgt idx 42 gtgtgt idy 42 codepre  pthe memory addresses are the same for x and yp  pthen if i do thisp  precodegtgtgt x  4 gtgtgt print y 3 codepre  pas it should. If i query the addressesp  precodegtgtgt idx 46 gtgtgt idy 42 codepre  pit appears that python has created new memory for the new x value and y remains the same. but then when i do thisp  precodegtgtgt y  4 gtgtgt idy 46 codepre  pit seems that python has searched through the memory looking for a value that matches the input variable, and then tagged that memory address with the name y  if no such value is found then it creates a new value in memory and then tags thatp  pam i right in my thinking herep  pthe problem that occurs to me that this is all well and good for my little x and y example, but what about a program with millions of variables does this mean that whenever a variable value is assigned, it has to search through the whole memory, looking for a match, before assigning new memoryp  pIntuitively, while this approach would definitely save a lot of space, it would probably not be very time efficient, however I imagine that a lot of people, much smarter than me, have put a lot of effort and work into making python, so obviously this isnt the case. So my question is what am i missing in my understanding that makes this method a good approach for memory managementp  pIs it simply a matter that searching through the list is at most time complexity On, and so with fast processors, this is not really an issue or is there something deeperp

Negative 309 pIm not sure if this is the right forum for this type of question, but I was trying to run an android vm in Genymotion, but the app I was using needed more cpus to run. When I tried to add more, it told me that I needed to have virtualization enabled in the bios, so I did that. I downloaded the havdetection tool to test if it had worked, but it said that it was not enabled. Now, I know for sure, I have checked and double checked, that it is in fact enabled in the bios, so why doesnt it detect that it is Genymotion still wont work, either.p

Negative 309 pIve been working with large log files 100 MB in Java and noticed that codegzipcode can compress them to around 3MB, making them 35x smaller.p  pSo I wonder do modern OSes compress files before loading them into memory It seems silly to use 100 MB of RAM to hold a file that really only has 3 MB of information.p  pOr is it the opposite Does the process of reading a file and dealing with encodings and whatnot mean that a file which takes up 100MB on disk is actually bigger than 100MB in memoryp  pbonus points Any recommendations for preprocessing I could do to my files before loading them in order to reduce my codeJVMcodes memory usage The files have the same format as codeApachecode server logs.p

I do not know the reason for this inconsistency, here is my code what could cause this any suggestions would be great as stated earlier I can see that everything is being passed correctly but on onPostExecute is inconsistent in binding to the Textview.  strongMain.javastrong         Main.Activity This simply connects to the Textview and sends           information to LocalFeedAuto which has the AsyncTask Classp  precode   AutoCompleteTextView  searchlocation AutoCompleteTextView findViewByIdR.id.search         searchlocation.setThreshold2         searchlocation.addTextChangedListenernew TextWatcher                      Override             public void beforeTextChangedCharSequence s, int start, int count, int after                             Override             public void onTextChangedCharSequence s, int start, int before, int count                  String SearchLocation  searchlocation.getText.toString                 new LocalFeedAutoSearchLocation, LocalFeed.this, searchlocation.execute                           Override             public void afterTextChangedEditable s                          codepre  pLocalFeedAuto.java my AsyncTask I only show onPostexecute because the other parts are simply to make database calls and that works correctly because I can gather its data strongLocalFeedauto.javastrongp  precode     This is my AsyncTask were I get database data and send to       AutcompleteTextview      at the very top the constructor that receives the inputs  public LocalFeedAutoString searchlocati,Activity act, AutoCompleteTextView searchlocation              this.searchlocatisearchlocati         this.actact         this.searchlocationsearchlocation            the rest is network calls then onPostExecute gets the output     protected void onPostExecuteString results          try                String Total has all the information      from the database that has been      returned from doInBackground and I check that data in println          System.err.printlnTotal              JSONObject jsonn  new JSONObjecttotal             JSONArray jArray  jsonn.getJSONArraylocationupdate             JSONObject jobject  null             String location               JSONArray sss  new JSONArray        All data returned is in Json so I read it here             for int i  0 i lt jArray.length i                  jobject  jArray.getJSONObjecti           location holds the information that           AutoCompleteTextview should show and           binds city state like city,state          location jobject.getStringcity  ,  jobject.getStringstate                 sss.putjobject                    I split the information by  city state pairs             String[] Arrays  location.split         I pass it back to the AutocompleteTextview here ArrayAdapterltStringgt adapters  new ArrayAdapterltgt  this.act, android.R.layout.simpledropdownitem1line,Arrays             searchlocation.setAdapteradapters                    catchException e                         codepre  pSince I can see all data is passing successfully in the System.err.println then it must mean that the adapter is not bind 100 of the time.p

Negative 309 pShort Question Is there a way to configure Nexus to emnotem update a proxy P2 repository from a remote repositoryp  pThe Longer Version We have a Nexus server that is used to internally host maven artifacts. There is a p2 proxy repository for a remote Eclipse P2 repository Subclipse. The url of the remote repository is a hrefhttpsubclipse.tigris.orgupdate1.10.x relnofollowhttpsubclipse.tigris.orgupdate1.10.xa. This proxy repository is part of a repository group. This setup works fine normally.p  pThe issue is when Subclipse updates the remote site with newer artifacts say, they move from 1.10.5 to 1.10.6. The proxy repository automatically gets the newer artifacts. We have a target platform file for Eclipse where the version numbers for features have to be fixed. When Subclipse gets updated, the fixed version number that the target platform looks for doesnt exist anymore.p  pSo I would rather that the proxy repository does not automatically update itself.

Negative 309 pI am using gruntcontribwatch to compile JSCSS files and livereload. The issue here is that i want to compile ONLY JS when I save a JS file, and ONLY CSS when I save a CSS file. After both of these I livereload. I tried this configuration p  precodewatch    JS      options        livereload true,     ,     files [clientjs, clientlib],     tasks [rebuilddev]   ,   CSS      options        livereload true,     ,     files [clientstyle, clientstylelib],     tasks [buildCSS]     codepre  pBut I cant have those two watch running at the same time. So I tried to put the livereload taks in a separate watchp  precodewatch    JS      files [clientjs, clientlib],     tasks [compileJS]   ,   CSS      files [clientstyle, clientstylelib],     tasks [compileCSS]   ,   live      options        livereload true,     ,     files[client]   ,  codepre  pThen I call it using concurrent p  precode serverAndClient          tasks [nodemon, watchJS, watchCSS, watchlive],         options            logConcurrentOutput true                ,      codepre  pIt kind of works, but it livereloads twice  once before the JSCSS is done compiling, and one afterwards. What is the correct way to do this  Of course the livereload must occur after the JS or CSS compiling tasks are donep
