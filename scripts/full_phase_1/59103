Positive 59103 pI have a ViewModel that wraps two lists of different objects codeListltReviewgt Reviewscode and codeDayCommentary DayCommentarycode into codeReviewViewModelcode. In my view, I group codeReviewscode by codeReview.Countrycodep  precodevar groupedReviews  Model.Reviews.GroupByitem gt item.Country codepre  pIn the view, I loop through codegroupedReviewscode and build an HTML table for each codegroupcode. My goal is to output each codeReviewcode in codegroupcode while still binding to the model for posting back to the controller.

Positive 59103 pI have read some theory based on Partial View, leaving me out with a few doubts. As I have read in some of the posts about Partial View in SO, I understand Partial View is a View that contains no Layout. Or a simplified version of a View that can be reused. For instance for a sidebar I could use Partial Views. p  pBut I would like to know if I would like to render another View inside a View can Partial View be used For instance I have a table with a list of items, I would like to display another table when one of the row in the parent table is clicked. Can the child table be represented using Partial View Or do I need to look for something else to achieve the samep

Positive 59103 pI want to build a .NET site with MVC and have some external links on it. These URLs I dont want to show directly, but through customized ones.  p  pFor example instead of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions69996673lowercaseurlsinaspnetmvchttpstackoverflow.comquestions69996673lowercaseurlsinaspnetmvca, just only a hrefhttpexample.comlink1234 relnofollowhttpexample.comlink1234a. p  pI know in PHP man can do it with .htaccess and a php file but Im not sure its possible in ASP.NET. Someone has suggested me to do it with .cshtml but I dont know how.p  pCan someone please help me to clear this questionp  pThanks.p  hr  pemUpdatedemp  pThanks for all your tipps. After reading the 2 pages on codeproject.com you suggested, I just think that these are useful only for internal URLs, for external they seem to be complicated. p  pI would think that for each external one I will have one URL a hrefhttpexample.comlink1234 relnofollowhttpexample.comlink1234a and then when clicked it will link with one View 1234.cshtml. This cshtml file should then redirect to the actual link I dont know as its possible with Razor. p  pSo I believe there must be a simpler way to get the job done. So anyone else  has other ideas, please share Thanksp

Negative 59103 pIm looking for some strategies regarding accessing some cached data that resides in a internal company web service.  Actually, preventing access of the cached data while the cache is being refreshed. p  pWe have a .Net 3.5 C web service running on a web farm that maintains a cache of a halfdozen or so datasets.  This data is configuration associated items that are referenced by the real business logic domain that is also running in this web service as well as being returned for any client uses.  Probably talking a total of dozen or so tables with a few thousand records in them.p  pWe implemented a caching mechanism using the MS Enterprise Library 4.1.  No huge reason for using this over the ASP.Net cache except that we were already using Enterprise Library for some other things and we liked the cache expiration handling.  This is the first time that we have implemented some caching here so maybe Im missing something fundamentalp  pThis configuration data doesnt get changed too often  probably a couple of times a day.  When this configuration data does change we update the cache on the particular server the update request went to with the new data the update process goes through the web service.  For those other servers in the web farm currently a total of 3 servers, we have the cache expiration set to 15 minutes upon which the data is reloaded from the single database that all servers in the farm hit.  For our particular purposes, this delay between servers is acceptable although I guess not ideal.p  pDuring this refresh process, other requests could come in that require access to the data.  Since the request could come during an expirationrefresh process, there is no data currently in the cache, which obviously causes issues.p  pWhat are some strategies to resolve this  If this was going in a single domain sort of WinForm type of application we could hack something up that would prevent access during the refresh by the use of class variablesloops, threadingmutex, or some other singletonlike structure.  But Im leery on implementing something like that running on a web farm.  Should I be  Is a distributed server caching mechanism the way to go instead of each server having its own cache  I would like to avoid doing that for now if I could and come up with some coding to get around this problem.  Am I missing somethingp  pThanks for any input.p  pUPDATE I was going to use the Lock keyword functionality around the expiration action that subsequently refreshes the data, but I was worried about doing this on a web server.  I think that would have worked although it seems to me that there still would be a possibility although a lesser one that we could have grabbed data from the empty cache between the time it expired and the time the lock was entered the expiration action occurs on another thread I think.  So what we did was if there was no data in the cache during a regular request for data we assume that it is in the process of being refreshed and just grab the data from the source instead.  I think this will work since we can assume that the cache should be filled at all times since the initial cache filling process will occur when the singleton class that holds the cache is created when a web service request is first made.  So if the cache is empty it truly means that it is currently being filled, which normally only takes a few seconds so any requests for data from the cache during that time will be the only ones that arent hitting the cache.p  pIf anyone with experience would like to shed any more light on this, it would be appreciated.p

I know C and Java very well but Im new to C p  pFrom wikipedia brp  blockquote   pIn objectoriented programming, a   virtual function or virtual method is   a function or method whose behavior   can be overridden within an inheriting   class by a function with the same   signature.p blockquote  pHowever I can override a method as seen below without using the codevirtualcode keywordp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  class A      public     int a   int Aa      return 1   class B  A       public     int a   int Ba      return 2   int main      B b     cout ltlt b.a ltlt endl     return 0   output 2 codepre  pAs you can see below, the function Aa is successfully overridden with Ba without requiring codevirtualcode p  pCompounding my confusion is this statement about virtual destructors, also from wikipediap  blockquote   pas illustrated in the following example,   it is important for a C base class   to have a virtual destructor to ensure   that the destructor from the most   derived class will always be called.p blockquote  pSo codevirtualcode also tells the compiler to call up the parents destructors This seems to be very different from my original understanding of codevirtualcode as make the function overridablep

Negative 59103 pIm extending some Linq to SQL classes.

Maybe I should make an Extension method using Expression, and then call that from the property  Can a property call an extension method  p  pThings like below dont workp  precodepublic static System.Linq.Expressions.ExpressionltFuncltIProduct, boolgtgt ProductName2 string pname      return p gt p.productname  pname  codepre  pBottom line, I know I need to wrap my access method in an Expressionlt.... but I dont know how to access that from the property, so that the reg5 variable above will work correctly.p  pWould be great if there was some magic attribute that I could just add to the property to autoexpression the property and make LinqToSql happy, instead of wrapping it in Expressionlt...  p  pWould love to be able to do this...p  precodepublic partial class ProductRegistration IProduct      [AutoExpression]     public string productname              get  return this.Product.productname        codepre  pstrongEDITstrong The link and answer below works.

Negative 59103 pIm working on a utility that will be used to test the project Im currently working on. What the utility will do is allow user to provide various inputs and it will sends out requests and provide the response as output.p  pHowever, at this point the exact format which input is required and what is optional has yet to be fleshed out. In addition, coding in Swing is somewhat repetitive since the overall work is simple though this should be the safest route to go as I have more or less full control and every component can be tweaked as I want. Im considering using a configuration file thats in XML to describe the GUI at least one part of it and then coding the event handling part in addition to validation, etc. The GUI itself shouldnt be too complicated. For each type of request to make theres a tab for the request and within each tab are various inputs.p  pThere seems to be quite a few questions about this already but Im not asking for a 3rd party library to do this. Im looking to do this myself, since I dont think itll be too overly complicated hopefully. My main consideration for using this is reusability later on, for other projects and for simplifying the GUI work. My question is are there other proscons that Im overlooking Is it worth the unknown time to do thisp  pIve built GUI in VB.NET and with Flex3 before.p

What is a simple way to define what types reside at what location in the collection and pull out those valuesp  pOne ugly way is to use codeSystem.BitConvertercode and a codeQueuecode or codebyte[]code with an index and simply iterate through, e.g.p  precodeint index  0 ushort first  System.BitConverter.ToUint16bytes, index index  2  size of a ushort int second  System.BitConverter.ToInt32bytes, index index  4 ... codepre  pThis method gets very, very tedious when you deal with a lot of these structuresp  pI know that there is the codeSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.StructLayoutAttributecode which allows me to define the locations of types inside a struct or class, but there doesnt seem to be a way to import the collection of bytes into that struct. If I could somehow overlay the struct on the collection of bytes and pull out the values, that would be ideal. E.g.p  precodeFoo foo  Foobytes  doesnt work because Id need to implement the implicit operator ushort first  foo.first int second  foo.second ... [StructLayoutLayoutKind.Explicit, SizeFOOSIZE] public struct Foo       [FieldOffset0] public ushort first     [FieldOffset2] public int second  codepre  pAny thoughts on how to achieve thisp  p[EDIT See also my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2480116marshallingabigendianbytecollectionintoastructinordertopulloutvaluequestion on how to deal with the bytes when they are big endiana.]p

Negative 59103 pSo I need to connect to a mssql server via Windows Authentication from a Unix server. Here are the obstaclesp  ol lipThe db admin created a service account but made it WindowsAuth only, meaning I cant pass the username and password directly to the server to connect.pli lipThe admin also added my hosts server to the firewall so that it would only accept requests from my host machine.pli lipMy host server has mssql enabled via freetdssybasedblib, but has the default secureconnections Off still set.pli lipI have a similar set up on my personal machine, but with secureconnections on, but I cant connect that way since Im firewalled.pli ol  pSo Im wondering if its possible to set up a proxy of sorts on my host so that I can start the connection on my personal machine using my local freeTDS library, but have the request pass to the host which would in my dream world not require secure connections to be on but simply would pass the request along so that it came from my nonfirewalled host but using the correct authentication method.p  pIf anyone is not familiar with how WindowsAuthentication works, its a type of Kerberos authentication where the client machine makes the request to the remote server so that credentials are never actually sent and thus cant be compromised by a maninthemiddle. So Im very doubtful that this can be done, since at some level my host machine has to do the actual work. But i thought Id ask since Im not totally clear on the deeper mechanics and because I really want to get this to happen.p  pI guess another way of looking at it is I want to use my host as a kind of VPN.p  pAlso, I am working with my host admins to find a more longterm solution but I need to see the database as soon as possible so I can have something working when the problem gets fixed.p

Negative 59103 pIm developing a hierarchical object model that is selfreferencing as a 01   relationship. An object without a parentID is a root element. The parentID is also the foreign key on the selfjoin. From my understanding, using the parentID as a foreign key will only point to a column where child elements may be found  does this force an iteration through the entire data set for that column Is this a scenario where a clustered index should be formed ....would it be proper to use the XML data type to store all childrenIDs in a single field then load and reference that document for each object It seems doing this would at least allow me to simplify my object persistence layer and give me more control over recording transactions.p  pAny advicep

Negative 59103 pMacports is the only packaging system I have checked out on the Mac and I dont like it.it needs all its applications installed in a particular location. Thats probably the reason why it showed Python2.5 as a dependency which needs to be installed even though I already had it. For a person who has moved over from Ubuntu, I sorely miss aptget. As far as Macports are concerned, there is no central repository so the source of a package is fetched from the project website, built and installed. p  pNow, Ubuntu has various open source projects in a deb format which can be properly installed on ubuntu machines. Whats more, there is also a central repo for all these debs.p  pProblems with Macportsp  ol liIt installs stuff even if its already present on the machine.li liIt always downloads, compiles and installs packages from the project website. It does not have a central repository for all packages.

Negative 59103 pIve been programming with Java for Android quite some while now. Since performance is very important for the stuff I am working on I end up just spamming global variables. I guess everyone will come rushing in now and tell me this is the worst style ever, but lets keep it simple. For Android, local variables means garbage collection and garbage collection is something that kills performance. p  pLately I have started using the NDK. Now I feel the urge to actually take all the local variables and change them to global variables. I am wondering though if this makes any sense in c code. Obviously it is no good style, but if it is needed for speed Ill sacrifice the style gladly. p  pIve looked through older threads about local vs global, but I havent been able to find anything about speed. So my question is, if I am calling a function very often is it relevant for the speed that local variables are created and die after the function is done Or doesnt it matter at all and I can happily keep on using the local variables.p  pI would test it myself, but for some reason the performance of my app goes up and down like a roller coaster and I doubt Ill be able to really make any sense of the data. I hope someone can help me out before I rewrite my whole code for nothing p

Negative 59103 pI have a third party .Net web application Sitecore which connects to an Oracle database on a server in my DMZ separated from my LAN with a firewall. Connectivity between the application and the database is slow.  It does not fail, the process called Publishing just takes a long time in comparison to the same process occurring between the application Sitecore and an Oracle database inside our LAN a few milliseconds versus 20 minutes. Interestingly I get the same behaviour when I use Toad for Oracle to query the database in the DMZ versus querying a copy of the database inside my LAN.   p  pI have replicated the setup inside our LAN and the problem goes away.  If I use an MSSQL database the problem also goes away.  If we dont use Sitecore or Toad and instead run simple queries in Oracles sqlPlus application the problem doesnt occur.p  pThis indicates to me that the problem is specific to applications that use the Oracle Data Provider for .Net, and  that are running inside our LAN and are trying to query an Oracle database outside our LAN.p  pOS is Windows 2008R2 64bit Oracle DB server, Windows 2008 32bit Sitecore, Win7 64bit Toad and SqlPlus clients.  Not sure what the firewall is but I think it is on some kind of a virtual switchrouter thing yeah, Im not a network guy, howd you guess.  Oracle is 10g.  Clients are using Oracle.DataAccess 2.102.4.0 or 2.102.5.0 for 64 and 32 bit.  Toad is 10.6.  Sitecore is 6.2.0 rev 091012p  pI have run various monitors like Wireshark, Procmon, and the Win7 Resource Monitor but Im not really sure what Im looking for.  All I can see is that there are large gaps of time between sends and receives but I cant determine where these gaps are being created. To me this is all really spooky. In my experience network connectivity either works or it doesnt, and if some traffic is slow, then all traffic is slow.p  pAny ideas as to what might cause this behaviour Specifically, what networkrouterfirewall settings might cause connectivity over TNS amp TCP protocols according to Wireshark to go slowly but not fail completely, for a particular implementation of an Oracle data providerp  pConfused and mildly spooked,p  pJames.p

But when I call restartInput..., this also hides the view that shows which key has been pressed. This seems normal behaviour to me, but I need a way around it. p  pExtending EditText and overriding onKeyUp is not a good idea, see a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumfromgroupstopicandroiddevelopersRIxGfx5qOjMhttpsgroups.google.comforumfromgroupstopicandroiddevelopersRIxGfx5qOjMa.p  pThe KeyboardView class has exactly what I need invalidateKey, but I think that is only accessible when you create your own input method.  p  pAnybody else have some better ideas p

Negative 59103 blockquote   pThe principal challenge of   multithreaded applications is   coordinating threads that share data   or other resources. To that end, the   threading module provides a number of   synchronization primitives including   locks, events, condition variables,   and semaphores.p      pWhile those tools are powerful, minor   design errors can result in problems   that are difficult to reproduce. So,   the preferred approach to task   coordination is to concentrate all   access to a resource in a single   thread and then use the Queue module   to feed that thread with requests from   other threads. Applications using   Queue.Queue objects for interthread   communication and coordination are   easier to design, more readable, and   more reliable.p blockquote  pIt, basically, states to use Queue.Queue for interthread communication and coordination, instead of the powerful tools such as semaphores, locks, etc.p  pMy question is, whats the drawback of the suggested method  When should one use the more powerful tools instead, and whyp  pstrongEditstrongp  pTo be clear, I know what semaphores are.

Negative 59103 pFolks  I have a task A which I perform sequentially 100 times.  Each task A has many tasks B which are processed in parallel.  B stores data which is needed after all As are completed.  So the programs memory footprint grows over time.

I implemented Server Garbage Collection and there was a dramatic improvement  As timetocomplete was cut in half  However, As timetocomplete was still growing with each successive A  linearly.  So by the 10th A, the improvements from Server Garbage Collection were irrelevant  the full 100 As would never complete in a reasonable time and I would need to stop the process.p  pMy hypothesis is that the growing memory footprint is causing GC to do more work over time, slowing everything down.p  ol liDo you have any other hypotheses I can testli liIf my hypothesis is worth exploring, what solutions can I pursue  Should I become more handson with the Garbage Collector  Maybe I should flush inmemory data to disk and suck it up when I need itli ol  pbEDITbbr I forgot to mention that each B calls GC.Collect and GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers because Im automating COM and thats the only way to ensure the COM server process is released.p

Negative 59103 pOK, so this should be simple... But I still cant figure it out. I am writing a program in java for Android to take the fft of a float array. On the complex frequency spectrum returned I extract the real and imaginary components so I can calculate some parameters such as magnitude and phase.

Negative 59103 pI am trying to make a file upload interface in ASP.NET webforms and am looking for some advice on how to proceed.p  pThe file upload interface is part of a website I am making on which users can post adverts. The interface is part of the create a new advert and will enable the user to upload up to 6 images. I am using only the asp.net FileUpload server control as I am trying to make a control which will work when users have javascript disabled. Thats the background.p  pThe upload for all 6 files occurs on button click. This stores the files in a temp folder UserUploadstemp until the user submits the form in which case the files are moved to the UserUploads folder and the references in the database or until the user hits the cancel button or navigates away in which case the files are deleted.p  pFirst question is Is storing the files in a temp directory the right way to go about this Or is there some better way of keeping the temp files on the server until the parent form is submitted The only alternative I can think about is saving the files to the session, but that seems like a recipe for killing the server...p  pSecond question I am unclear what to do when the user just closes the browser window. I want to avoid ending up with a mess of orphaned files in the temp directory. Is there some way to make sure that all the files will get cleared out if the user doesnt go through with the form submission Or do I just have to perform a cleanup of the temp directory every so oftenp  pThird question Am I doing this completely wrong and there is in fact a much better approach to uploading multiple filesp

Negative 59103 pHeres the scenariop  pI have an HttpHandler that Id like to run for specific URLs, but those URLs dont have consistent extensions, so I cant map the handler using httpHandlers in web.config.p  pInstead, Ive got a custom HttpModule in which I subscribe to PostAuthenticateRequest, check some conditions, and assign my custom handler using HttpContext.RemapHandler if the current URL qualifies.p  pThats all working great, but...p  pTo improve performance, Id like to do my URL checking and handler assignment only if a handler isnt already assigned.  I wont bore you with why my handler only applies when no other handler is assigned, but its always the case.p  pThe real problem here is that one can only test if a handler is already assigned on PostMapRequestHandler, and by that time, its too late to use RemapHandler because an InvalidOperationException will get thrown see a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.httpcontext.remaphandler.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.httpcontext.remaphandler.aspxap  pWhat I thought may work at that point but doesnt is HttpContext.Handler  x instead of HttpContext.RemapHandlerxp  pWhen set this way, HttpContext.CurrentHandler gets updated and all appears glorious, but the custom handlers ProcessRequest never gets called.p  pThank you in advance for your thoughts  comments  insight.p
Negative 59103 pI have a VBS script I use at work for automating tasks when connected to Cisco routers and switches, including automating the login process.  Not unreasonably people are a little edgy about storing their password in a plain text VBS file, so I provide them with the option to prompt every time for the password or have it stored in the script.p  pIs there a method by which I could call out to a Windows API which might be able to handle encryption for me  I would need a way to both a encrypt the original password so it could be safely stored in the script, and b provide a way of calling the decrypt function for use within my main script so that I can use the plain password.  There is no built in function for encryptiondecryption in VBS that I can find.p  pI realise that anyone with access to the script to read the password could also easily add a WScript.Echo DecryptstrEncryptedPassword type line to the script, but this doesnt seem to worry anyonep  pAny help would be appreciated.  Im not great with API programming in truth Im a poor VB6 programmer turned network engineer so please bear this in mind with responses.p

Im using the DrawToBitmap method suggested in the question linked above and that works most of the time. However there are a few problems.p  pstrongProblem 1strongbr I have two tabpages, lets call them A and B. The Control I want to take a screenshot of is in tabpage B. I want to take the screenshot when a button in tabpage A is pressed. This works most of the time, except when tabpage B hasnt been accessed yet then the screenshot is just white. If I first access tabpage B, then go back to tabpage A and click the button to take the screenshot then it works fine. Im guessing this is because of some loading or building of the control in the tab that hasnt been done yet, but Im not sure what exactly or it could be something else entirely. Ive been trying to force that loading or building using ResumeLayout, PerformLayout, Show, Update, Invalidate but that doesnt work.br strongEDITstrong Managed to solve this by using codeDrawToBitmapcode on the containing tabpage control instead of the Control itself and doing a Show on that tabpage.p  pstrongProblem 2strongbr When I take a screenshot of a certain custom Control a subclass of UserControl there is a small rectangular white area in the screenshot where there shouldnt be one obviously. The rectangular area isnt on one particular part of the control like a button or textbox so Im not sure whats causing this.

Negative 59103 pHey I have some jqueryajax code for a shoutbox and the problem I am having is that in IE when I had the form tags around the input message and submit button in the html code, upon pressing the enter key in the message box it was reloading the page, this was not occuring in other browsers, so I removed the form because it was not needed, and the enter key is now submitting the message in IE but not in chrome or firefox.

Negative 59103 pIm writing a program that reads from a list of files.  The each file either contains a link to the next file or marks that its the end of the chain.p  pBeing new to Haskell, it seemed like the idiomatic way to handle this is is a lazy list of possible files to this end, I havep  precodegetFirstFile  String gt DataFile getNextFile  Maybe DataFile gt Maybe DataFile  loadFiles  String gt [Maybe DataFile] loadFiles  iterate getNextFile . Just . getFirstFile  getFiles  String gt [DataFile] getFiles  map fromJust . takeWhile isJust . loadFiles codepre  pSo far, so good.  The only problem is that, since getFirstFile and getNextFile both need to open files, I need their results to be in the IO monad.  This gives the modified form ofp  precodegetFirstFile  String gt IO DataFile getNextFile  Maybe DataFile gt IO Maybe DataFile  loadFiles  String gt [IO Maybe DataFile] loadFiles  iterate getNextFile ltlt . Just . getFirstFile  getFiles  String gt IO [DataFile] getFiles  liftM map fromJust . takeWhile isJust . sequence . loadFiles codepre  pThe problem with this is that, since iterate returns an infinite list, sequence becomes an infinite loop.  Im not sure how to proceed from here.  Is there a lazier form of sequence that wont hit all of the list elements  Should I be rejiggering the map and takeWhile to be operating inside the IO monad for each list element  Or do I need to drop the whole infinite list process and write a recursive function to terminate the list manuallyp

Negative 59103 pIve got a Vaadin application and Im getting some strange behaviour when running two instances of the application at the same time one in FF, another in IE. Ive already removed most static objects these caused the application to completely reload when used parallel to another open application and now I can interact normally with the UI without the complete reset. However, Im now noticing that Im getting only one users data in both interfaces. I assume this is caused by singleton objects Im using to manage some data caching and a SOAP connection. Id like to know if its the singleton pattern itself thats causing the strange output or is it just the static instance object Im keepingp  pIve tried using ThreadLocal with my singleton, but all my variables are always null when I try to use them in my singletons functions. Currently my singleton contains this, which is probably terribly, terribly wrong since it doesnt work. p  precodeprivate static ThreadLocalltSoapClientgt instance  new ThreadLocalltSoapClientgt  public static synchronized SoapClient getInstance     if instance.get  null          instance.setnew SoapClient          return instance.get  codepre  pI chose a singleton object so Id always have access to the cached data and my users soap connection everywhere in my application instance, and the only other way I can think of for doing that is to have a static object somewhere, but the static keyword seems to be the cause of all my problems in the first place. Is there any way around this or is there something else causing it p
Negative 59103 pI am having an issue with a string manipulation method I have written. The purpose of this method is to seek out link tags within a long string, and reformat their hrefs.p  pTo give some context, I am parsing a large number of HTML files that were on a CD and collating the results in to xml files that are on a website in a separate project I wrote this as part of a console app. The html files contain instructional text and this contains links that are relative to the files on the CD, and I need to change the hrefs to be relative to the website the information is going on.p  pThe following code appears to work just fine if there is only one link tag, but pass it two, and the output is very messed up. Strangely, Visual Studios Regex editor claims that the linkTag regex below is only matching the link tags, but when it comes round to replacing the links with the correct hrefs, it inserts link fragments at various points within the instructions string.p  pThe reason for the additional regexs alphaDir is that I will eventually expand this method to correct links with different starting hrefs. We are talking about parsing thousands of html files, but this format is the most common by far.p  pI am at a bit of a loss on this one as I am very much a regex beginner, and wrote all of the regexs below myself, so any thoughts on any of these would be great too.p  h3Typical Input stringh3  precodeHold 1st ltstronggtlta href..ffisthand.htmlgtFISTltagtltstronggt hand, back outward   ampamp fingers forward, and put 2nd ltstronggtlta href..ffisthand.htmlgtFISTltagtltstronggt hand, back forward   ampamp fingers inward, with lower knuckle of its 4th finger on   lower knuckle of 1st thumb then slide 2nd hand forwards one   hands length. codepre  h3The Methodh3  precodestatic string instructionsstring instructions              Regex Spaces  new Regexsnr         Regex linkTag  new Regexlta.gt.ltagt         Regex linkTagHtml  new Regexlta.gtltagt         Regex hrefAttr  new Regexhref.

Negative 59103 pIve been working on access management solution for an application Java EE.p  pHere is what I have currently In the application I have a filter that checks whether specific HTTP headers are set and authenticates the user based on these values.

For instance I need SAML so I was wondering about implementing a component that would handle SSO using SAML or OpenID then set the HTTP headers like above and forward request for processing to JBoss. strongHow that differs from the current implementation described above is that the new authentication mechanism would be implemented in Java rather than as another Apache module.strongp  pMy questions is how to handle communication from one Java EE application to another Java EE application in the same way Apache HTTPD and TomcatJBoss communicates using AJP Is there any service like that in JBossp  pSimilar question Ive just managed to find a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions149662isthereanimplementationofajpprotocoleinjavaIs there an implementation of AJP protocole in Javaap

Negative 59103 pI am producing reports that are comprised of 4 chapters, an introduction chapter and 3 dynamically created chapters.

The three dynamic chapters are working fine and look as they should, and other than the missing images the combined version looks as it should as well. p  pOne of the dynamic chapters uses the InsertFile method to bring in 6 images that are saved as RTF files. I cant change the format of the incoming images, and since they are not technically images I have to insert them as text.

No callbackfindduplicate function here is called in form validation library. The form is populated.

Negative 59103 pI am working on a Spring MVC 3.1 web application, and almost all of my form submits are done using jQuery ajax calls and form serialization. This works great. I needed a way to pull the validation error messages back from the server, so I looked for an example. I found one online that essentially placed the BindingResult object into a custom JsonResponse object then returned it as the codeResponseBodycode. This also is working great Here is where we get to my problem, though the codeBindingResultcode object comes back, none of the messages are being interpolated as they would if I was using the Springform tags. I looked into the issue, and found that I could attempt to overwrite the codeSpringMessageSourceInterpolatercode with a custom one, this helped, but now only the JSR303 validation errors interpolate, not the actual codeTypeMismatchcode errors from the Spring binding. Here is an example of what I am doingp  precode     public ResponseBody      JSonResponse addQuoteModelAttributequote Valid QuoteBean quote, BindingResult result, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws IOException               jsonResponse  new JsonResponse          Some handle code          jsonResponse.setStatusJsonResponse.ResponseStatus.INVALID         jsonResponse.setResultresult.getAllErrors          return jsonResponse       codepre  pAs I said, the Json is serialized perfectly, and for the JSR303 errors, the codedefaultMessagecode field of the error object is an interpolated message, but if the error is a Spring codeTypeMismatchcode Like putting code1code into a field Im binding to a Date, I instead end up with a long Spring generated message. I have tried adding message codes that correspond to all of the codeerror.getCodescode that are on the object to no avail such as codeTypeMismatch.fieldnamecode. Surely someone has used Spring and Ajax and had this validation working, but I cannot find the answer.p

Negative 59103 pI searched and read thru the Diamond and virtualinheritance questions here, but could not find an answer. My thinking is that this situation is a little unusual, and I am willing to entertain the ideas that my requirements are somewhat off. On the other hand, I think this should be doable in a nice way.p  pThe situation and the requirementsp  pI have a C class library over which I have no control, and which I cannot change. It defines a codeWindowcode class. The codeWindowcode class has a protected member say codehandlecode, not otherwise accessible, that derived classes are meant to use. codeWindowcode defines hundreds well, a very large number... of methods which I dont care to reimplement by delegating in a decorator, say.p  pI want to add functionality to codeWindowcode, so that derived classes which I write say codeLogWindowcode automatically have. An example of such functionality is the ability to snap windows to each other. In order to implement this I need access to codeWindowcodes protected codehandlecode member.p  pFor my reallife purpose this is enough, and the solution is simple derive codeSnappableWindowcode from codeWindowcode, and derive all my codeWindowcodederived classes codeLogWindowcode in this example from codeSnappableWindowcode.p  pHowever, what I would emreallyem want, and is prettier IMHO, isp  ol liThe ability to have this Snappable functionality as a standalone piece of code, which I can choose to plug into any other codeWindowcodederived class, or not.li liThe ability to extend this notion to other functionalities as well, for example the ability to minimize windows. So I could have a codeWindowcodederived class, with or without the Snappable ability, and with or without the Minimizable ability.li liThe implementations of SnappableWindow and MinimizableWindow both need access to codeWindowcodes codehandlecode protected member.li liI would like Snappable and Minimizable to be part of the actual class declaration, so that my actual class codeLogWindowcode is a Window, is a SnappableWindow, and is a MinimizableWindow.li ol  p... and now to the questionp  pI get how I can do this with declaring codeSnappableWindowcode and codeMinimizableWindowcode as emnotem deriving from codeWindowcode but rather getting a codehandlecode in their constructor, and then deriving codeLogWindowcode from codeWindowcode and from any combination of codeSnappableWindowcode and codeMinimizableWindowcode.p  pEDIT codehandlecode is initialized, in codeWindowcode, halfway thru LogWindows constructor, after it has called codeWindowcodes init. and not half way thru codeWindowcodes constructor, as Ive said before.p  pemHoweverem, since codehandlecode is only initialized half way thru codeLogWindowcodes constructor after it has called codeWindowcodes codeinitcode , I cant pass is to codeSnappableWindowcode and codeMinimizableWindowcode as part of codeLogWindowcodes constructor initialization list. Rather, I would have to explicitly call some codeinitcode method on both, passing it the codehandlecode. And this, in each of my codeWindowcodederived classes. codeLogWindowcode, codeSearchWindowcode, codePreferencesWindowcode, etc.p  pI am looking for a way to be able to do something likep  blockquote   pclass LogWindow  public Window, public SnappableWindow, public MinimizableWindowp blockquote  p... and not have to implement anything else inside codeLogWindowcode. Ive fiddled with virtual inheritance, but cant quite come up with the solution.p

Negative 59103 pI am acquiring the current location in my BlackBerry app through GPS and it is working fine. This location is being updated every few seconds.

For obvious reasons, Id like to tack the username into the logging message so I have an idea of what is going on.p  pSo my solution is to do something like thisp  precodepublic class ExceptionUtil      private ExceptionUtil    no instantiation     private static final ThreadLocalltStringgt local  new ThreadLocalltStringgt     public static void setString user  local.setuser      public static String get  return local.get   codepre  pThen in my postsgets, I can do thisp  precodeString username  request.getSession.getAttributeusername ExceptionUtil.setusername codepre  pThen in my exceptions, I might do this contrived, bad practice examplep  precodecatchSQLException e      logger.errorExceptionUtil.get   did something dumb in sql, e     throw e  codepre  pThe only problem Im concerned about is how Tomcat will manage my threads. What if they keep the threads Will they persist Will the ThreadLocal values also persist If I was storing the entire Session in the ThreadLocal instead of just a String, that would be a serious memory leak potential. It also means if someone forgot to reset or forgets to clear when done the usernamesession on a thread that persisted for multiple requests, there might be stale data in there.p  pCall my cynical, but I dont want to have to rely on programmers even, especially myself not forgetting to do things for a programs correctness. If I can idiotproof my code, Id like to. And that means getting a better understanding of how Tomcat will use the threads.p  pSo, the question in a singlesentence form p  blockquote   pIf I use ThreadLocal in a webapp running on Tomcat 7.0.27, do I run   the risk of a Thread being used for multiple requests, and with it   data from a previous request being persistedp blockquote  pI should note that even though they dont answer the exact question of TomcatThreadLocal shenanigans, I am open to alternative solutions that allow me to elegantly access session variables for logging purposes. I am also open to commentary about potential pitfalls of my solution. I have a business problem to solve, and Im not married to any one solution. I just want to know who keeps causing the exceptions on my prod system p

This is to say that I cannot by any means revert to Y v1.0.br On the other side, the developer has similar restrictions to use Y v1.0.p  pAs you can already argue, the question is how can I link Y inside X without exporting Y symbols to avoid collisions Y is well established, and possibly Id not want to modify its source code or build settings if publicly available.p  pTo put things more onto Earth, I am in the process of designing an SDK that will for sure need some 3rd party libraries, lets say zlib. In my development Ill rely on zlib v1.2.3.4.5.rc6 because I extensively and successfully used and tested it, and I cannot afford the SDK testingfixing required if I change version.br All the statically or dinamically linked libraries the SDK will offer must hide the 3rd party static ones.brp  pThe potential customer could undergo similar restrictions he needs zlib v7.8.9, so how can I avoid symbol collisions Again, possibly without changing the original source code namespacing etc..p  pTo complicate things, the SDK is multiplatform, implying Id need different ways to solve the problem depending on the platform Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, Android, ... and compiler used e.g., MSVC and g.brp  pThank you.p  pstrongUpdatestrongbr It seems I am VENDOR2 of this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3232822linkingwithmultipleversionsofalibraryLinking with multiple versions of a librarya br bstpierres answer seems a viable solution, but Im not sure it works or if it can be reproduced on OSes other than nix.p

However, if Android kills the app for whatever reason, my app crashes.

Negative 59103 pIve noticed that languages like Java have a char primitive and a string class. Other languages like Python and Ruby just have a string class. Those languages instead use a string of length 1 to represent a character.p  pI was wondering whether that distinction was because of historical reasons. I understand the language that directly influenced Java has a char type, but no strings. Strings are instead formed using char or char[].p  pBut I wasnt sure if there was an actual purpose for doing it that way. Im also curious if one way has an advantage over another in certain situations.p  pstrongWhy do languages like Java distinguish between the char primitive and the string class, while languages like Ruby and Python do notstrongp  pSurely there must be some sort of design concern about it, be it convention, efficiency, clarity, ease of implementation, etc. Did the language designer really just pick a character representation out of a hat, so to speakp

Negative 59103 pI need to use the standard location service and perform some processing, including some network calls, every location update notified. I need location updates being processed in FIFO order, to keep tracking of the device, and get results as fast as possible. What should be the best way or technique to ensure that locations are processed in order and processing does not overlap and besides to get a fast response operation queues, dispatch queues, or threads directly or even another way, if it exists It looks like operation queues and dispatch queues are almost the same, in terms of performance, but dispatch queues seem to be easier to handle, so I dont know what could be the advantages of each one. Regarding threads, I have been discouraged to usually use them, but I dont know if their efficiency over operationdispatch queues is really noticeable and it is worth to use them.p  pThanks in advance  p

Negative 59103 pIm attempting to write my own timestamps method that gets run during the migration.  The one that is in place now adds a NOTNULL constraint on the field, and I really really dont want that.  p  pThe problem I have is that I have a multi schemad database.  Where each major client gets their own schema.  When we onboard a new client we create a new tenant record then run a migration for a newly minted schema.  p  pThe new schema is supposed to be an exact copy of the tables in the other schemas, except of course with no data. p  pThe last migration I ran was using a slightly older version of rails.  Still in the 3s but a smidge older.  When it created the timestamps they were NULLable.  When I ran migration the other day on a new rails... Well all the fields are now NOTNULLp  pI have code that was developed with the idea that updatedat was only populated when the record was updated... not when it was created.  third party apps and database functions create the records..  The third party apps and database functions that create records are falling down on the new schema...  Ive gone in and removed all the NOTNULL constraints on all the tables manually, but I dont want to have to write the cleanup right into my migration task, so that all future tables are corrected.. p  pI figured the best thing to do was to override the timestamps method that was changed, back to one that didnt break existing code. p  pSo theres the reason I need to revertoverride..  brMy question now is... How do I override the method.  I cant see a clear class path to it and Im not exactly sure how to override it.. p

Negative 59103 pI have a problem and could not identify the reason until now.p  pI have a maven project that has several modules. One of these modules is the webservices client.p  pSo, during development, when running the install in maven, it needs to access the local server to generate the client. When I run the plugin to generate the release of the project, clients should point to the production server.p  pTo do this I set as a key property server.address which is used to point to the server when generating the clients. There is one profile which, when active, this key property rewrites the address to the production server.p  pWhats going on Running mvn install is generating correctly, ie, pointing to the local server. When I generate the release using the command mvn releaseprepare B releaseperform Denvprd is not rewriting the variable as it should.p  pThe strange thing is that if I run mvn install Denvprd, it generates correctly, pointing to the production server.p  pCould someone give me a hint of what to change to work also in release cyclep  precodeltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0

Negative 59103 pI have two Active Directory servers performing both authentication and DNS. One server is 2003 and the other is 2008.  It is my understanding that there is no primary Domain server in this scenario and that everything will replicate from 2003 to 2008 without issue.p  pI have a 3rd virtual 2008 server which has been preforming DHCP for over 2 years without a problem. It is now appearing that I cannot properly authorize DHCP Red downward arrow. When I attempt authorization, I do not get an error.  It simply does not function and appears to not be authorized. I also tried netsh for authorization.p  pI have an error in the logs of the DHCP stating The DHCP Service failed to see a directory server for Authorizationp  pOne change that was made recently was that I tried to revive the old physical DHCP server for performing another service.

Negative 59103 pId like to make a code.changecode event that fires whenever text is changed in a certain class of input boxes. I have several boxes that I would like to sum together and refresh the total any time the values are changed.

Negative 59103 pSo Ive been trying out the Kendo UI grid and I initially started with just the plain nonMVC helper generated client side grid, taking data from a Web API controller via GET. Worked just fine but was starting to get messy model binding the sort and filter parameters.p  pSo I started using the MVC helpers and ran into a problem, which is thisp  pWhen using the nonMVC generated grid, configured to use GET and with the dataSource type NOT SET, the GET params look like thisp  precodepage    1 pageSize    10 skip    0 sort[0][dir]    asc sort[0][field]  OrderID take    10 codepre  pThis is the correct form to bind to the DataSourceRequest MVC helper...BUT if I render said grid using the MVC extension, it sets the dataSource type to aspnetmvcajax which causes the GET params to look like thisp  precodefilter   group    page    1 pageSize    10 sort    OrderIDasc codepre  pand if you have multiple sort params it joins them with a .. This second format will not bind properly to DataSourceRequest and so you end up with a null Sorts member....emthis seems completely backwards to me because you would only have the DataSourceRequest helper if you were using the MVC extension  but when you use them, the data is being sent incorrectlyem p  pI also tried POSTing to a regular MVC Controller as per the examples and had the same problem.p  pIn any case, Im trying to find a way to tell the extension to not render the aspnetmvcajax. Anyone have any ideas Thanks in advance...p

Negative 59103 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pHi, I am going to ask a question which seems emutopicem for me, but I need to know if there is a way to achieve what I need. And if not, I need to know strongwhy notstrong.p  pstrongThe ideastrongp  pSuppose I have a database structure, in strongMySqlstrong.p  pI want to create some solution to allow anyone emno matter who, no matter whereem to have a synchronized copy emupdated cloneem of this database emwith its contentemp  pWell, and it is not going to be just one synchronized copy, it could emand shouldem be a multiple replication emsupposing the basic, this means, for example, ten copies all over the worldemp  pAnd, the most important thing It must be strongsecurestrong. By secure I mean only realaccepted transactions will be synchronized with all the others emno matter how manyem database copiesclones.p  pemNoteem Since it would be strongquite difficultstrong to make the synchronization in realtime,  I will design everything to make this feature dispensable. So it is not required.p  pstrongMy autosuggestionstrongp  pThis is how I am thinking to manage itp  pstrongTime identifiers and Updates checkingstrong Every action eminsert, update, delete...em will be stored as the action instruction itself, associated to the time identifier. em[I think better than a DATETIME field, itll be an INT one, with the number of miliseconds passed from 1st january 2013 on, for example]em. So each copy is going to ask to the emneighbour copyem for new actions done since last update, and execute them after checking they are allowed.p  pemProblem 1em the emneighbour copyem could be outdated too.br emSolution 1em do not ask just one neighbour, create a strongrandom liststrong with some of the copiesclones and ask them for news emI could avoid the strongliststrong and ask ALL the clones for updates, but this will be inefficient if clones number ascends too muchem.p  pemProblem 2em Realtime global synchronization is not active. What if...p  precode   Someone at CLONEENTERPRISING inserts a row into TABLE.    ... this row goes to every clone ...    Someone at CLONEFIXEMALL deletes this row.    ... and at the same time, somewhere in an outdated clone ...    Someone at CLONEDROPOUT edits this row now inexistent at the other clones codepre  pemSolution 2em easy stuff, force a GLOBAL synchronization before doing any new emdependingonthirddataem action  emedit, for exampleem. This global synch. will be unnecessary when making an INSERT, for instance.p  pemNoteem Well, someone could have some fun, and make the same insert in two clones... since theyre not getting updated in realtime, this row will exist twice. But, its the same as when we have one single database, in some needed cases we check if there is an existing samerow before doing the final action. Not a problem.p  pemProblem 3em It is possible to edit the code and do not filter actions, so someone could spread instructions to delete everything, or just make some trolling activity. This is not a problem, since good clones will always be somewhere. Those who got bad wont interest anymore.p  pI really appreciate if you read. I know this is not the perfect solution, it has possibly hundred of holes, but it is my basic start. I will now appreciate anything you can teach me now. Thanks a lot.p  pstrongPS.strong It could be that all this I am trying already exists and has its own name. Sorry for asking then emId anyway thank this name, if it existsemp

Negative 59103 pIm trying to parse 802.11 frames myself and Ive encountered two problems that I cant solve.p  pFirst of all, when does an LLC Logical Link Control header follow a IEEE 802.11 data frame  I thought when there is data in a frame, there would always be an llc overhead preceding the data, but I have a wireshark with Ethernet II instead of LLC. But I have no idea how to actually know if its gonna be an LLC or a Ethernet II header following my 802.11 data header. Theres no field in the 802.11 header specifyin whats following. p  pSecondly, I have noticed something in wireshark when I open a capture file containing 802.11 QoS data frames. At the end of the header theres the QoS control field, which is normal, its specified in the IEEE 802.11 documentation ive read it over and over again to try to find an answer to my question But then, theres 2 bytes that wireshark considers part of the 802.11 header when you click on the raw bytes, wireshark points to the 802.11 header, but the signification of the bytes is not displayed in the fields of the header  Does my question make any sense p  pHere are images to explain what Im not understanding. On the first screen shot below, you see the 802.11 header selected and you see below the concerned bytes in hexadecimal. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtQa04.png altEntire 802.11 headerp  pPay attention to the last bytes of this packet00 00 10 aa p  pNow I expand the 802.11 header and click on the very last field of it QoS control, as specified in the RFC. You can see that the corresponding bytes are 00 00. But those bytes are not the last bytes of the packet  There still is 10 aa thats part of the wifi packet but I have no idea what those bytes represent p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcuj85.png altlast field selectedp  pAny one has an idea p

A fullprecision float is given here.br  2 arcsin is a nonalternating series, thus Van Wijngaarden or sumalt transformations are ineffective too unless there is a way Im not aware of to generalize them to nonalternating series. a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiVanWijngaardentransformation relnofollowhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiVanWijngaardentransformationabr p  pThe only acceleration left I can think of is Chebyshev polynomials.

Negative 59103 pstrongBackgroundstrong I am developing a tool which boots up a custom build of Linux and boots into QT based desktop for x86 based machine. My custom Linux runs from USB and when the it boots on a machine with certain brand of sound cards connected, then my tool runs to a live lock situation with a lot of interrupts. I doubt its some problem with APIC driver but the system is renderd useless and I have to poweroff the system.p  pstrongMy Questionstrong I would like to simulate the same situation by using a kernel driver or module. I am not sure if I can cause an interrupt to fire from a module. I have a experience with I2C or SPI which causes interrupts on ARM based Linux boards. But i dont know how to do it from a module p  pCould anybody please suggest me how to cause an interrupt from a driver p

Negative 59103 pjust having some small issues with c winforms datagridview. Heres my scenariop  pI am using entity framework and am trying to bind certain entity models to my datagridview datasource.p  precodevar query  from q in context.foo select q  dgvDisp.DataSource  query.ToList codepre  pWhen I ran this piece of code above on a form class which had a datagridview in the GUI, it all worked fine. The datagridview will automatically generate columns and the number of rows. p  pBut when I run this exact same code with the exception that I dont have a datagridview in the GUI, I just declare it programmatically and then set the datasource like the above code. And when I do it this way, no rows or columns are generated. p  pWhat is the difference between these two different datagridviews I know that there are properties set in the designer.cs file of the form class. But I tried copying these settings and it still wont populate.p  pI know its probably something simple but I just cant figure this out at all. If someone could show me what im doing wrong, thatd be great p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI have used AutoGenerateColumns  true but it didnt make any difference. Also Im not actually trying to display this datagridview, I was just binding it to entity objects that way I could access its members using a string index. But I dont want to query the database just to get my info in a datagridview specific format because in my actual scenario, I already have my entity data from a previous query. I was just using the above code as an example.p
Negative 59103 pIm writing a small game with WebGL to help myself understand some of the core concepts in 3D games programming Without the use of an existing engine. The project is just something Ive got going on in my spare time and if I felt the need, the WebGL version would be a prototype with a native program coming second.p  pIm currently at the stage where Im trying to animate character models, and have been struggling for days trying to figure out how its supposed to be done. Ive found it difficult to find any simple tutorials online that I could go by Or to even translate from another programming language, so Ive come to this site for some guidance.

Negative 59103 pI am monitoring query information on my IBM DB2 9.7 such as how long some queries take to execute. But how do I reset this information and clear the monitors Apparently they are reset when the whole DB instance is reset, but this forces all connections to close also on other databases in this instance not good.

Negative 59103 pIm trying to solve the following problem related to distributionp  pI have a list L of items I1, I2,....In sorted in order of importance, I1 being the most important. Each item has multiple tags assigned to it and the combination of these tags can be different on each item, so I1 may have tags T1 and T2, I2 can have tags t2, t3 and t4, and I3 can have tag T1, and so on. p  pNow, I have to make batches from this list L, with a distribution of items according to the tags subject to the following constraintsp  ol liEach batch has a fixed size Bli liEach tag has a range of items in the batch distribution, ranging from a minimum to maximum. So, B should contain minimum x1 items with tag t1, x2 items with tag t2, and maximum y1 items of t1, y2 items of t2 and so on.li liWe start picking items from the top of L and keep filling the batch until we reach the final distribution that satisfies the constraints. If, say, L has 300 items, and we have to make a batch size of 50, we can go until any number of items in the list and pick the items to make the desired distribution.li liRemember that if an item is picked from the list, count of all the tags assigned to it goes up by 1.li ol  pI was thinking of a solution where in first, I make lists of items corresponding to each specific tag. I pick the minimum desired items for a particular tag from its list. So, Id pick x1 items with tag t1 from the list of items with tags t1, irrespective of whether the items contain any other tag. This way Id ensure that the minimum criteria of all the tags are satisfied.  But for the max part, each tag will most definitely go overboard. How do I recursively keep replacing items from the batch with the remaining items in L to make the final desired distributionp  pAny other solution would be great. Or any existing algorithm that can get me in the right direction to approach this problem.p  pI know the question is a bit too wordy, and probably a bit confusing, but Iv tried to explain it as well as I can, and of course, the problem might be a lot interesting I suppose. p

If there is no way to return set that equals quantities then return null.p  ul liExample 1 ul liBundle Sizes 46, 25, 12, 4, 3li liquantity 30li liReturned Value 460, 250, 122, 40, 32 bundle size of bundlesli ulli liExample 2 ul liBundle Sizes 46, 25, 12, 4, 3li liquantity 17li liReturned Value 460, 250, 120, 42, 33li ulli liExample 3 ul liBundle Sizes 46, 25, 12, 4, 3li liquantity 47li liReturned Value 460, 251, 121, 41, 32li ulli liExample 4 ul liBundle Sizes 46, 25, 12, 4, 3li liquantity 5li liReturned Value nullli ulli ul  pHow would go about this problem p  pI have written a program in C that does close enough job but resets an index in a for loop to dump bundle sizes that will not work with the rest of the set. Will post source if requested for how far it goes.p  pRequested codep  precodepublic Listltintgt BreakDownListltintgt bunSize, int buySize              Listltintgt tempBunSize  bunSize.ToList

Negative 59103 pSo, again, making a pong clone, and run into a bump. Im creating the codegamecode class gamestate for my state machine and in the definition, I instantiate two classes of the class Ive created for the the different player paddles and I give them two different arguments that will decide if the class becomes the player one or player two object. But it seems like the program wont allow me to pass an argument in the class definition. Ive tried to put the class instantiation in the codegamecode class constructor but then the eventslogicrender functions dont have access to the paddle classes. That leads me to think it has to be in the codegamecode class definition. Heres the code presenting the problem.p  precodeclass Ball  public     void events     void logic     void render     Ballint server     Ball   class Paddle  private     SDLRect PaddleBound     int yVel     SDLRect clip     int playerkey public     void events     void logic     void render     Paddleint player     Paddle   class Game  public GameState  private     int server     TTFFont score  NULL     Paddle PlayerOne1     Paddle Playertwo2     Ball Ball2 public     void events     void logic     void render     Game     Game  codepre  pThe lines that say p  precodePaddle PlayerOne1 Paddle Playertwo2 Ball Ball2 codepre  pAre the ones raising errors that say expected a type specifier. Now I know that means it wants something like codeint playercode but I need to pass a number so that the constructor can decide which player itll be, which ultimately decides what keys move the class up and down the screen. So to be perfectly clear, I want to be able to pass an argument to a class instantiation so that the class constructor can turn the class into the left OR the right paddle. So how do I go about instantiating a class, inside another class, using argumentsp  pThanksp  pEDIT For the constructor problem I have another example that is fully coded where I cant put the class initializer in the constructor.

There are nearer approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist the Politicus or Statesman is more ideal the form and institutions of the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws as works of art, the Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no other Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same perfection of style no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not of one age only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper irony or a greater wealth of humour or imagery, or more dramatic power. Nor in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and speculation, or to connect politics with philosophy. The Republic is the centre around which the other Dialogues may be grouped here philosophy reaches the highest point cp, especially in Books V, VI, VII to which ancient thinkers ever attained. Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the moderns, was the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance of truth and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of science which was not yet realized. He was the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world has seen and in him, more than in any other ancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge are contained. The sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many instruments of thought to afterages, are based upon the analyses of Socrates and Plato. The principles of definition, the law of contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion, between means and ends, between causes and conditions also the division of the mind into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures and desires into necessary and unnecessarythese and other great forms of thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and were probably first invented by Plato. The greatest of all logical truths, and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight, the difference between words and things, has been most strenuously insisted on by him cp. Rep. Polit. Cratyl, although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings e.g. Rep.. But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae,logic is still veiled in metaphysics and the science which he imagines to contemplate all truth and all existence is very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered Soph.

Negative 59103 pRecently Ive been getting back into programming in C and have come across interesting while programming something else.p  pIn the code below I defined a class with a pointer member that gets deleted in the class destructor.p  pI have also defined a function which takes a TestObject object as an argument which calls one of the getval method which does nothing more but report the value held in the memory address the pointer is pointing to.p  pNow when I call the function twice it correctly prints the value in held by the internal pointer correctly once, then just core dumps after the second.p  pCorrect me if Im wrong, but I believe that the reason this happens is because after the first time the function is called the objects destructor is called because the object has gone out of scope and is essentially destroyed.p  pThe only way I could think of preventing this is by passing the object by reference. Is there any other way to prevent this from happening It seems a bit dangerous to simply pass the object by reference since the object can be modified in that function call which could lead to headaches later on.p  pIve tried making the argument const, however I get an error stating that const TestObject as this argument of void TestObjectgetval discards qualifiers argument.getvalp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  class TestObject      private     int internalpointer     public     TestObjectint value              internalpointer  new int         internalpointer  value          TestObject               delete internalpointer         internalpointer  NULL          void getval  coutltltinternalpointerltltendl    void testoutsiderTestObject argument      argument.getval   int main      TestObject test  TestObject4     testoutsidertest     testoutsidertest     return 0  codepre

Negative 59103 pI apparently have done something really wrong, and there must be a simple solution.  Ive a USB device that Im trying to talk to that uses a FTDI USB to RS232 converter.  They provide a driver library ftd2xx.dll and header file ftd2xx.h as a programming interface.  I created a simple project in QtCreator that, to this point does nothing.  It compiles and runs fine.  However, as soon as I include ftd2xx.h, I get a host of errors.  For examplep  precodetypedef PVOID  FTHANDLE typedef ULONG  FTSTATUS typedef void PFTEVENTHANDLERDWORD,DWORD WORD VendorId codepre  pThese lines, and many similar to them, cause these errorsp  precodePVOID does not name a type ULONG does not name a type Typedef PFTEVENTHANDLER is initialized use decltype instead WORD does not name a type codepre  pIm not sure where to go from here.  Ive spoken to FTDI support and they say the only header file I need is ftd2xx.h, which is the one that is causing the issues.  Im overlooking something here.p

Negative 59103 pMaybe this theory is missing in my programming education, but in object oriented languages, is it possible to construct a method that is able to codereturncode two or more variables instead of just one.p  pE.g. I really like codeMatlabcodes way of handling this      code[var1, var2]  myFunctioninputcodep  pWhere if I for example only need codevar1code, I can dop  pcode[var1, ]  myFunctioninputcodep  pHence discarding the variable I dont need at that particular instance.p  pDue to large datashifts in my actual implementation, I dont want to store the return variables globally, just call the same function over and over again, but receiving the specified needed values for that instance.p  pI thought of the following approach of doing so but I was wondering if theres a better way.p  precodepublic static Double myFunctionDouble input, Integer method      double calcOne    input5     double calcTwo    input25     double calcThree  input300      switchmethod            case 1  return calcOne        case 2  return calcTwo        case 3  return calcThree        default return calcOne        codepre  pNote that I clearly need the seperation between the codereturncode statements and the calculations calculations in real program involves a large codefor loopcode and reading from files etc.p  h2Edith2  pThe reason why I dont use 3 different methods is because I use a very large codefor loopcode in my method. My main method then sometimes needs one codereturncode variable from this method and sometimes two.p  pTherefore the following might be a better solutionp  precodepublic static ArrayListltDoublegt myFunctiondouble input, int[] method      double calcOne    input5     double calcTwo    input25      ArrayListltDoublegt returnValues  new ArrayListltDoublegt      if Arrays.asListmethod.contains1              returnValues.addcalcOne          if Arrays.asListmethod.contains2              returnValues.addcalcTwo           return returnValues  codepre  pwhere codeint[] methodcode contains the variable names the function should return.p

The application will start with the welcome message followed by instructions to use the . character when they are finished entering strings.   The application is to continue to prompt the user to enter strings as long as . is not entered. Every time a string is entered, the application will store it in an ArrayList object.  When the user is done entering strings, the ArrayList object will be passed to a method named printShortestString.  This method will determine which of all the strings the user entered is the shortest and print that string along with its length.

Negative 59103 pIm working on a Django site that allows connecting to devices in restricted networks through a cloud service.

Negative 59103 pstrongI EDITED THE SOLUTION BELOW THE QUESTION strongp  hr  pI have read like 30 similar articles on this, but nothing quite hits the spot.p  pMy scenario in order to feed a charting library highchartshighstock with data in ASP.NET I  manually created the basic classes for such a graph. This is due to the fact that all the wrapper projects work for highcharts but NOT for highstock. However, highstock requires a HTML script block like this workingp  precodeltscriptgt container2.highchartsStockChart,  title      text GraphTitlestring , yAxis      title          text YAxisTitlestring     ,     height 200,     lineWidth 2,     top 80 , series [          type line,       name Testdata,       data [[Date.UTC2014, 3, 8, 0, 0, 3], [Date.UTC2014, 3, 9, 0, 0, 2], [Date.UTC2014, 3, 10, 0, 0, 4], [Date.UTC2014, 3, 11, 0, 0, 4], [Date.UTC2014, 3, 12, 0, 0, 3], [Date.UTC2014, 3, 13, 0, 0, 4], [Date.UTC2014, 3, 14, 0, 0, 2], [Date.UTC2014, 3, 15, 0, 0, 1], [Date.UTC2014, 3, 16, 0, 0, 4], [Date.UTC2014, 3, 17, 0, 0, 0]]   ]  codepre  pp  pI created the c classes and their properties, as for examplep  precodepublic class Series      public string type  get set      public string name  get set      public object data  get set       codepre  pLater on I use JsonConvert.SerializeObject to serialize my chartobject with instanced classes title, yAxis, series etc within, which results in following outputp  precode   title      text GraphTitlestring   ,   yAxis      title        text YAxisTitlestring     ,     height 200,     lineWidth 2,     top 0   ,   series [            type line,       name Testdata,       data [[Date.UTC2014, 3, 8, 0, 0, 3],[Date.UTC2014, 3, 9, 0, 0, 2],[Date.UTC2014, 3, 10, 0, 0, 0],[Date.UTC2014, 3, 11, 0, 0, 4],[Date.UTC2014, 3, 12, 0, 0, 4],[Date.UTC2014, 3, 13, 0, 0, 2],[Date.UTC2014, 3, 14, 0, 0, 1],[Date.UTC2014, 3, 15, 0, 0, 1],[Date.UTC2014, 3, 16, 0, 0, 0],[Date.UTC2014, 3, 17, 0, 0, 3]]        ]  codepre  pSo the problem is the value of seriesdata is enclosed in quotes. As highstock obviously requires an object array as data [[DateTime, value],[DateTime, value],...etc], the chart is not rendered unless I remove these quotes around the array.p  pWhen the array was pure integer there would be no quotes I guess, but as my points need to be DateTimevalue I need an array of objects. p  pTherefore the question stronghow can I force my JSON serializer to NOT enclose my value of an object array in quotesstrongp  pMaybe this is trivial and simple, and I was looking to far.

Negative 59103 pFor work, I have to connect to dozens of Linux machines via SSH to perform maintenance, monitor the system, install software, etc.p  pI have a small arsenal of scripts that help me do some of these tasks, and these are located in a folder on my Mac in Usersmebin. I want to be able to run these scripts on the remote Linux machine, but for several reasons I do not want these scripts permanently located on these machines e.g., other people also connect to these remote machines, and it would be unwise to let them execute these files.p  pstrongSo, is possible to share scripts across an SSH connection for the lifetime of the session onlystrongp  pI have a couple of ideas on how to do this, but I dont know if any of them will work. Firstly, if SSH allows file mounting, I could automatically mount memymacUsersmebin to melinuxremotebin when I connect to the remote Linux box, and set my PATH variable to PATHremotebin. Secondly, I could set up port forwarding in the connection string e.g., codessh melinux R 9999127.0.0.1ltSMBPORTETCgtcode and every time I connect mount the share and set the PATH variable.p  pstrongEDITstrong Ive come up with a semisolution. On the linux machine, edit codeetcsshsshdconfigcode to add the following subsystem codeSubsystem shareduserbinary sudo su l c binmount t cifs o port9999,usernameme,nounix,secntlmssp 127.0.0.1exportedbin mntremotebin ampamp bash l i scode. When connecting to the remote machine, set up a reverse port forward and invoke the subsystem.

Negative 59103 pI am in the process of updating my cordova app which was last released in January  prior to the significant changes to the File plugin. All is working fine in ripple old style, but when run on the iOS simulator or iOS device iOS 7.1, my window.requestFileSystem call will never return neither fail nor succeed. This behaviour occurs for both persistent and temporary file systems.p  pI am guessing I have some configuration problem. However, I have tried everything to no avail. Adding console messages I find the window.requestFileSystem call in my code does call requestFileSystem in the requestFileSystem.js of the plugin. I also find the CDVFile methods are all called in this order initWithWebView, pluginInitialize, getExtraFileSystemsPreference, getAvailableFileSystems, registerExtraFileSystems which registers library, librarynosync, documents, documentsnosync, cache, bundle, root.p  pHowever, the exec call in requestFileSystem.js to requestFileSystem simply never returns and doesnt ever execute the method in CDVFile.

Negative 59103 pIm reading a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa21303928vsql.8029.aspx relnofollowUnderstanding Locking in SQL Servera. But I dont quite understand the purpose of update locks.p  pDetails description as belowp  blockquote   pUpdate Locksp      pUpdate U locks prevent a common form of deadlock. A typical update pattern consists of a transaction reading a record, acquiring a shared S lock on the resource  page or row, and then modifying the row, which requires lock conversion to an exclusive X lock. If two transactions acquire sharedmode locks on a resource and then attempt to update data concurrently, one transaction attempts the lock conversion to an exclusive X lock. The sharedmodetoexclusive lock conversion must wait because the exclusive lock for one transaction is not compatible with the sharedmode lock of the other transaction a lock wait occurs. The second transaction attempts to acquire an exclusive X lock for its update. Because both transactions are converting to exclusive X locks, and they are each waiting for the other transaction to release its sharedmode lock, a deadlock occurs.p      pTo avoid this potential deadlock problem, update U locks are used. Only one transaction can obtain an update U lock to a resource at a time. If a transaction modifies a resource, the update U lock is converted to an exclusive X lock. Otherwise, the lock is converted to a sharedmode lock.p blockquote  pConsider below two transactionboth transaction execute at codeIsolation Level Repeatable Readcode in order to hold S lock during transactionp  pexecute below SQL in TRAN1.p  precodeBEGIN TRAN SELECT BrandName FROM dbo.Brand WHERE BrandId2 codepre  pnow, TRAN1 grant S lock for RIDp  pexecute below SQL in TRAN2p  precode BEGIN TRAN  SELECT BrandName FROM dbo.Brand WHERE BrandId2 codepre  pnow, TRAN2 grant S lock for same RID resource as TRAN1p  pexecute below SQL in TRAN1p  precodeUPDATE dbo.Brand SET BrandNameYBrand WHERE BrandId2 codepre  pnow, TRAN1 S lock convert to U lock and the U lock wait TRAN2 S lock release to convert to X lock p  pexecute below SQL in TRAN2p  precodeUPDATE dbo.Brand SET BrandNameZBrand WHERE BrandId2 codepre  pThen deadlock occurs.p  pUp deadlock is exactly as description as what U lock use for prevent. But deadlock still occurs. p  pSo my question is what U lock different with X lock And which situation make it can prevent deadlock instead of use X lockp

Each point has an associated value.Each dataset is unrelated, so the problem can be seen as just a single set of points.p  pIf the value of a point exceeds a predefined threshold value then the point has to be queried against an oracle spatial database to find all line segments within a certain distance of the point.p  pWhich is a simple enough problem to solve.p  pThe line segments have a nonunique ID, which allow them to be grouped together into features of size 1 to 700 segments its all predefined topology.p  pUltimately I need to know which feature IDs match against which points as well as the number of line segments for each feature match against each point.p  pIn terms of dataset sizesp  ul liThere are around 200 datasets.li liThere are 56,000 points per dataset.li liThere is a little over 180,000 line segments in the spatially indexed database.li liThe line segments can be grouped into a total of 1900 features.li liUsually there arent many more than in the order of 103 points that exceed the threshold per dataset.li ul  hr  pI have created a solution and it works adequately, however Im unhappy with the overall run times  it takes around 3min per dataset.p  pNormally I wouldnt mind if a precomputation task takes that long, but due to constraints this task cannot take more than an hour to run, and ideally would only take 12 an hour.p  pCurrently I use SDOWITHINDISTANCE to do the query, and I run this query for each and every point that exceeds the thresholdp  precodeSELECT id, countshape AS segments, sumlength AS length FROM          SELECT shape, id, length         FROM lines1     UNION ALL         SELECT shape, id, length         FROM lines2  WHERE SDOWITHINDISTANCE     shape,     sdogeometry         3001,         8307,         SDOPOINTTYPElng,lat, 0,         null,         null     ,     distance4 unitkm   TRUE GROUP BY id codepre  pThis query takes around 0.4s to execute, which isnt all that bad, but it adds up for a single dataset, and is compounded over all of the datasets.p  pI am not overly experienced with Oracle spatial databases, so Im not sure how to improve the speed.p  pNote that I cannot change the format of the incoming set of points, nor can I change the format of the database.p  pThe only way to speed it up that I can think of is by pre computing the query for each point and storing that in a separate table, but Id rather not do that as it more or less creates another copy of the data.p  pSo the question is  is there a better way to do queryp

Negative 59103 pIs there a way I can catch exceptions in the codeentercode method of a context manager without wrapping the whole codewithcode block inside a codetrycodep  precodeclass TstContxobject     def enterself         raise ExceptionId like to catch this exception     def exitself, etyp, eval, trcbak         pass   with TstContx     raise ExceptionI dont want to catch this exception     pass codepre  pI know that I can catch the exception within codeentercode itself, but can I access that error from the function that contains the codewithcode statementp  pOn the surface the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13074847catchingexceptionincontextmanagerenterCatching exception in context manager codeentercodea seems to be the same thing but that question is actually about making sure that codeexitcode gets called, not with treating the codeentercode code differently from the block that the codewithcode statement encloses.p  p...evidently the motivation should be clearer. The codewithcode statement is setting up some logging for a fully automated process. If the program fails before the logging is set up, then I cant rely on the logging to notify me, so I have to do something special. And Id rather achieve the effect without having to add more indentation, like thisp  precodetry     with TstContx         try             print Do something         except Exception             print Heres where I would handle exception generated within the body of the with statement except Exception     print Heres where Id handle an exception that occurs in enter and I suppose also exit codepre  pAnother downside to using two codetrycode blocks is that the code that handles the exception in codeentercode comes after the code that handles exception in the subsequent body of the codewithcode block.p

Negative 59103 pI want to expand a paramter pack into a function call, like thisp  precodefuncgetvaluearg... codepre  pwhere func and getvalue are two functions. The question is that getvalue is sensitive to evaluation order, so I think one solution is to generate something like thisp  precodefuncgetvaluearg0, 0, getvaluearg1, 1, getvaluearg2, 2 codepre  pif, for example, therere three parameters. With this counter Ill know the evaluation order. This there a way to do so p  pOr as another solution, is there a way to simply specify the evaluation order of those calls to getvalue with args If so, I dont even need a counter.p

Negative 59103 pI am working on a project that manage production of large number of documents in batches. The workflowp  ol liThe user creates a new Batch using the application, based on a template that defines its requirements requirements are usually files that user will have to upload and the system will process.li liOnce all requirements are met, the system will process all inputs and generate a large number of documents thousandsli liThose documents need to be post processed JustInTimeli liSome batch operations have to be done, for example, publishing all documents, in which case, all those documents will need to be postprocessed first.li liThere are constraints on what operations can run simultaneously, each document can be post processed at most once, etc.li ol  pI have currently modeled the Batch itself as an aggregate root, but dont store the list of produced documents in the Batch object itself, but rather retrieve those documents from my data store using a collection id that was persisted in the batch object. The only reason I chose to do this was because I didnt want to make my aggregate root contain a large collection and become bloated, but this is getting in the way of developing the business logic, because now I have to deal with consistency issues across documents in the batch.p  pMy question is, in DDDCQRS, when using a document database for persistence andor when using event sourcing, how should one deal with aggregates that contain large collectionsp  pI have seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3958107domaindrivendesignaggregaterootswithlargecollectionsthis posta and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2210262dealingwithnestedaggregatesindddthis posta, neither addresses my concern, one uses nhibernate collection filters that is neither and option for me, nor do I think is the right way to deal with this issue since it leaks storage logic into the domain model, the other is more about accessing objects in nested aggregates and doesnt address storageretrieval issues.p  pFYI, using .net, c, service bus, using an oversimplified generic repository backed by SQL, planning to switch to MongoDb in very near future.p
Negative 59103 pIs editing shared preferences in a separate thread redundant if you use apply p  pI have the following code block in an onCreate method of my MainActivity p  precode    final MainActivity activityReference  this      Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor.executenew Runnable          Override         public void run                if it is the first time running             SharedPreferences prefs  PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferencesactivityReference             ifprefs.getBooleanMainActivity.FIRSTLOAD, false                    enable a setting on first run                                      SharedPreferences.Editor editor  prefs.edit                 editor.putBooleanMainActivity.FIRSTLOAD, true                 editor.apply                             codepre  pBecause the instance of SharedPreferences.Editor is calling the apply method it should be asynchronous but prior to running in a separate thread we still got Strict Mode violations. The violations are StrictModeDiskRead violations so the assumption is that they result from obtaining the SharedPreferences, not calling apply. Additionally it seems as though Samsung devices have this problem almost exclusively.p

Negative 59103 pIm trying to create an app that makes HTTP requests through an intentservice. I need the app to wait for the service to finish its run aka, have the request be returned with some data before it continues its operations, as its operations involve manipulation of the data I hope to receive from the HTTP requests. Ive tried numerous means of doing so  Semaphore, CountDownLatch, but it seems that for all of them, I need some method of passing in the waitingcounting object into the intentservice so that it can tell the main thread where that object is waiting that it is done processing. How do I go about doing that Basically, I want a synchronous, blocking call to an http server to work conveniently with an Intent Service, since an intent service makes multi threading easy.p  pAgain to reiterate just to make sure im not misusing terminology What I mean by Synchronous and blockingwhat I want I make a call to the http server by sending an intent to my intentservice that makes the request. My UI thread, or thread from which this intent was sent, now waits until the request has been processed and a result has been returned before continuing to run.p  pIf you think that I am going about this process making http calls in a blocking, synchronous way all wrong, what is another way you might choose to go about it Thanks p

Negative 59103 pI have a program written in VB.NET and I wrote it with all my SQL statements hardcoded into the program. I wanted to try to store all my queries externally in an XML file so that changes can be made to the SQL if needed without having the go into the code and rebuild the program every single time.p  pThe part that is complicating things is that the SQL statements require variables to be added to it for it to run properly. p  pFor examplep  blockquote   pSELECT namefirst, namelast, emailid FROM amp eventNamep blockquote  pWith codeeventNamecode being a variable in the program.p  pWhen I set up the XML file, I tried both of the followingp  precode    ltDatagt         ltLoadSavesgt               ltSQLStatementgtlt[CDATA[SELECT namefirst, namelast, emailid FROM ampeventNameamp]]gtltSQLStatementgt         ltLoadSavesgt     ltDatagt codepre  pandp  precode    ltDatagt         ltLoadSavesgt               ltSQLStatementgtlt[CDATA[SELECT namefirst, namelast, emailid FROM amp eventName]]gtltSQLStatementgt         ltLoadSavesgt     ltDatagt codepre  pI needed the CDATA because without it, special characters would sometimes make it act weird. p  pMy problem is that the program doesnt do any substituting of variables because in both methods, the program pulls the entire thing as a string.p  pUsing the first method, I was able to just put some code in that would search for codeampeventNameampcode and replaces it with the variable I need in there. This method worked perfectly but then defeats the purpose of having the SQL externally for easy modification, because if all of a sudden I need codeattendeeNamecode instead of codeeventNamecode, then I can change it in the XML file but then I would still need to change the code to look for codeampattendeeNameampcode instead and substitute accordingly.p  pIs there any way I can handle this in a more dynamic way instead of having everything hard coded. Like I said, I want to be able to have my SQL in a separate file for easy modification if needed without having to touch the code, but with keeping in mind that each of my SQL statements require variables to be added to them before they can run.p

Negative 59103 pIm currently working on building an ERPCRM database in Access 2013 to cover all nonfinancial aspects of running a business such as customersupplier info, contacts, order and deliveries tracking, and that sort of thing.p  pWe manufacture madetomeasure joinery products windows, doors etc. One thing that Im finding is that Ill need to have the ability to write notes about records in almost every table in the database. For example, I may want to write notes on the following tablesp  ul licodetblAccountcode which holds customer and supplier info, e.g. This customer always has special glass.li licodetblDeliverycode  Customer has requested that driver parks at back of house on London Road.li licodetblQuotecode  Quote does not include timber cladding for steels  supplied by others.li ul  petc. etc.p  pSo currently I have a codetblNotecode which has the following fieldsp  ul licodeNoteIDcode  PKli licodeAccountIDcode  FK to codetblAccountcodeli licodeDeliveryIDcode  FK to codetblDeliverycodeli licodeQuoteIDcode  FK to codetblQuotecodeli liSeveral more FKs to other tables which contain things I might need to keep notes on.li licodeEnteredByUsedIDcode  FK to codetblUsercode of the database user who entered the note onto the system.li licodeEntryDatecode  Date note was enteredli licodeNoteTextcode  the text of the noteli licodeCommTaskIDcode  Explained later  see belowli ul  pWhen entering a new note, most of the FKs to other tables will be blank except those which the note actually concerns. The notes will be viewed either on a subform, e.g. when browsing through customer accounts there will be a box which shows notes about that customer.p  pThe reason for having notes in their own table is that each record in the database e.g. a customer account may need to have more than one note attached to it.p  pI also want to implement task assignment and tracking, and communication logging. For example when we receive a phone call from a prospective new customer asking for a quotation we would record that the call was received and when, the customers contact details, note that they have requested a quote along with minor details about what they want quoted, plus flag it for action required either by a specific database user or with nobody specified. It might also be created as a p  pWith this in mind I have codetblCommTaskLogcode which has the following fieldsp  ul licodeCommTaskIDcode  PKli licodeCommMethodIDcode  FK to codetblCommMethodcode which holds things like codePhone callcode, codeFaxcode, codeEmailcode and codeIn Personcode.li licodeAccountIDcode  account record of the person customersupplier making the contactli licodeEnteredByUserIDcode FK of user who entered this record.li licodeEntryDatecodeli licodeIsActionRequiredcode  Booleanli licodeActionRequiredByUsercode  FK to user table to flag who needs to take action on this item could be blank if this action can be completed by anybody.li licodeActionCompletedDatecode  Date when the action was marked as completed.li licodeActionCompletedByUsercode  Another FK to user table for user who completed task.li ul  pAs seen above there is then a codeCommTaskIDcode in the notes table which would allow you to create note records which contain any relevant notes about the communication or task.p  pBasically my question is Is there a better way to go about this Am I missing something It seems a clunky way to go about things but Im unable to come up with a better one which follows DB normalisation rules.p

Negative 59103 pI would like to hava a static Path property to be scanned for children files, this Path references a zip file and I cant close it because it will be referenced randomly. At some points I need to write into the zip file. The problem is I dont want to close the file system, because the Path property need to be open for future reading, and if I dont close it I cant see the written changes.

Negative 59103 pCan someone with OpenGl experience please suggest a strategy to help me solve an issue Im having with rotationsp  p     Imagine a set of world coordinate xyz axes bolted to the center of the universe that is, for purposes of this discussion they do not move. Im also doing no translations, and the camera is fixed,      to keep things simple. I have a cube centered at the origin and the intent is      that pressing the x, y, and z keys will increment a variable representing the number of degrees to rotate the cube iabout the world xyz axesi. Each key press is 90176 you can imagine rotating a lego brick in such a way, so pressing the x key increments a float property RotXdeg  RotXdeg  90.0f  Likewise for the pressing the y and z keys. p  pA naive way to implementsup[1]sup  this isp  precode   Gl.glPushMatrix      Gl.glRotatefRotXdeg, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f     Gl.glRotatefRotYdeg, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f     Gl.glRotatefRotZdeg, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f     Gl.glPopMatrix codepre  pp This of course has the effect or rotating the cube, iand its local xyz axesi, so the desired rotations about the iworldi xyz axes have not been achieved. For those not familiar with OpenGl, this can be demonstrated by simply rotating 90amp176 about the x axis      amp8212 which causes the local y axis to be oriented along the world z axis amp8212 then a subsequent 90amp176 rotation about the y, which to the user appears to be a rotation      about the world z axis. I believe this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3349575openglmatrixrotationquaternionsposta is asking for something similar, but the answer is not clear, and my understanding is that quaternions are just one way to solve the problem.  It seems to me that      there should be a relatively straightforward solution, even if it is not particularly efficient. Ive spent hours trying various ideas, including creating my own rotation matrices and trying ways to multiply them with the modelview matrix, but to no avail. I realize matrix multiplication is not commutative, but I have a feeling thats not the problem.p  p[1] By the way, Im using the Tao OpenGl namespace thanks to httpvasilydev.blogspot.com for the suggestion.p  pa hrefhttphome.earthlink.netcepeasleyRotationTestRotateTest relnofollowCode is hereap

Negative 59103 pIve a parent  child actor relationship to upload files to Dropbox. The relation consists of a supervisor actor and an upload actor.

Negative 59103 pIm looking for a way to add application event logging really mostly logging of click events to an existing application, but by creating a string of a portion of the control hierarchy.p  pI want to be able to log these click events in Silverlight or ASP.NET, but I want to be able to log the hierarchy of controls. However, this isnt just all controls, I want it to be specific ones. I want to be able to assign an id or a name to the levels I want for example, a Silverlight app would be the first level, a tab in that app would be the third level, a button on that tab would be the fourth level. I dont need or want to know every single control in between all of that, just the ones I identify as significant.p  pI am toying with the idea of just defining an interface like suchp  precodePublic Interface ILoggableControl     Property SystemName As String End Interface codepre  pthat contains a string property for a name and implement this interface on all Controls I need it on. Then I would recurse up through the control stack looking for controls that implement this interface. If found, I add it to the string hierarchy I will print, otherwise carry on up the stack. I envision ending up with something like a string like MainApp.AddFormTab.SubmitButton.p  pFor examplep  precodePublic Function GetLogHierarchyByRef c As FrameworkElement As String      If c Is Nothing Then         Return String.Empty     End If      Dim sb As New StringBuilder     If c.Parent IsNot Nothing Then         sb.AppendGetLogHierarchyc.Parent     End If      If TypeOf c Is ISystemActivity Then         If sb.Length gt 0 Then             sb.Append.         End If         sb.AppendDirectCastc, ISystemActivity.SystemActivityName     End If      Return sb.ToString End Function codepre  pHowever, I am concerned that this might make for a lot of code changes where I am using builtin controls. For example, if I want to be able to apply this interface to a TabItem control, I would need to create my own version e.g. p  precodeMyCustomTabItem Inherits TabItem Implements ILoggableControl codepre  pand change all references toTabItem to use MyCustomTabItem instead. This could quickly spiral out of control depending on how many controls types I want to modifyp  pI cant use the Tag field already used for other things, or the Name field I want to be able to specify a friendly name on Control objects.p  pAm I missing something here Is there a more straight forward approach to this Ultimately, Im just looking for the least intrusive way to capture the hierarchy info that specifies the portion of the UI that is accessed, typically for click events.p

This is a piece of coursework and I need to come up with the code on my own. p  pstrongEDITstrong to clear something out, for me acq, qca, caq, aqc, cqa, qac, etc. are the same thing  To make it even clearer, what happens is that the string gets sorted in alphabetical order, so all those permutations should come up as one unique result, acq. So, I dont need all the permutations of a string, but rather, given a 4 character long string, all the 3 character long ones that I can derive from it  that means taking out one character at a time and returning that string as a result, doing that for every character in the original string. I hope I have made my problem a bit clearerp

Negative 59103 pMy company is researching implementing an identity server.  Essentially we need to act primarily as a service provider, but need to accept claims via either SAML, OpenId and OAuth I realize this is an authorization protocol  and then reroute to the appropriate application server using tokens. Its possible that we would act as an identity provider too and make assertions to outside service providers.  p  pSo far the servers we are looking into are WSO2 and OpenAM, but are curious as whether there are any other servers that are being widely used.  p  pWed also like to be able to use something thats written in .NET.  The above mentioned servers are both Java.  p  pAny available resources with regards to this question would be greatly appreciated as well as any feedback on whether youve used either of the above servers and what your experiences were.p  pThanksp
Negative 59103 pImaging that we are given a finished C source code of a library, called codeMyAwesomeLibcode.

Ideally, all we want to do next is to copy codelib.socode codeswig.pycode and codepython.pycode into the corresponding directory in codesitepackagescode in a empythonicem way, i.e. using p  precodepython setup.py install codepre  pHowever, I got very confused when trying to achieve this simple goal using codesetuptoolscode and codedistutilscode.  Both tools handles the compilation of python extensions through an internal system, where the source file, compiler flags etc. are passed using codesetupextmodule[Extension...]code.  But this is ridiculous since codeMyAsesomeLibcode has a fully functioning build system that is based on makefile.  Porting the logic embedded in makefiles would be redundant and completely unnecessary work.p  pAfter some research, it seems there are two options left, I can either override codesetuptools.command.buildcode and codesetuptools.command.installcode to use the existing makefile and copy the results directly, or I can somehow let codesetuptoolscode know about these files and ask it to copy them during installation.  The second way is more appealing, but it is what gives me the most headache.  I have tried the following optionts without successp  ul licodepackagedatacode, and codeincludepackagedatacode does not work because .so files are not under version control and they are not inside of any package.li licodedatafilescode does not seems to work since the files only get included when running codepython setup.py sdistcode, but ignored when codepython setup.py installcode.  This is the opposite of what I want.  The code.socode files should not be included in the source distribution, but get copied during the installation step.li licodeMANIFEST.incode failed for the same reason as codedatafilescode.li licodeeagerresourcescode does not work either, but honestly I do not know the difference between codeeagerresourcescode and codedatafilescode or codeMANIFEST.incode.li ul  pI think this is actually a common situation, and I hope there is a simple solution to it.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 59103 pI am trying to build an iOS app that includes a today extension. As I understand the shared codebase to be used in the app and the extension should be placed in a dynamic framework.p  pMy framework AiredKit uses Alamofire and SwiftyJSON via cocoapods. The framework is then included in the app Aired. I included AiredKit.framework in the settings of my target and apparently cocoapods added a Pods.framework entry to that same list. Now I can use my framework via a simple codeimport AiredKitcode and code completion and building the app works just fine.p  pWhen I try to do the same in my extension AiredToday however, Xcode returns an error in at the codeimport AiredKitcode line, stating that the Alamofire and SwiftyJSON modules are missing.

Without the dialog  elseif branching the code executes correctly, even though by drawing the solid circle only in red or black according you include the canvas.setColorColor.RED statement or not.

Negative 59103 pstrongWhat im trying to dostrong Make a SKSpriteNode follow a UIBezierPath where the endpoint is the position of the users touch.p  pstrongThe problemstrong When the user touches i send the location to the player node which handles moving it self. However this only works when the player node is pointing upwards, for example at the first touch. Other touches make the player move to the wrong point.p  pImage describing the problem a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comnleXj.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comnleXj.pngabr I have added some explaining things in photoshop so here is an explanationbr   Thick  is the SKSpriteNode that im moving.br   Purple squares is the exact location of the touches, numbered in order actually SKSpriteNodes added for debug purposesbr   Thin arrows is the position of the player when the touches occurred.  p  pI believe the issue is somewhere in the conversion between the player nodes coordinate system and the scenes coordinate system.br For example The first touch when player zRotation hasnt been changed moves the player to the correct position.

Negative 59103 pQuestion regarding Auto Contraints and a dynamically resizable label. p  pI have a timer label that initally displays 0000.00 mins, seconds, milliseconds. When this timer reaches one hour or more I wish to resize the label to 000000.00 while preserving the .Centerx constraint. Text justification on the label is set to Left so that the counting of numbers does not jitter the text as it rejustifies to the different sizes of text. p  pI have my constraints set as the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHVlJR.png altInitialConstraintsp  pHeres how the timer looks initially or when only counting minutes up to 595959 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.compxh9f.png altMinutesViewp  pAnd heres how it should look when Hours are involved in the count. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWE8K4.png altHoursViewp  pNow the issue is that when hours are involved the width is dynamically resized due to greater than constraint and this causes the timer label to jitter as the different milliseconds are counted.  p  pI desire to resize the label when counting hours to a width of 150 and back to 110 when hours are not counting  all while preserving the CenterX constant. p  pI have tried to programatically resize the label when the count is in hours as so p  precodelet widthConstraint  NSLayoutConstraintitem TimerLabel, attribute NSLayoutAttribute.Width, relatedBy NSLayoutRelation.GreaterThanOrEqual, toItem nil, attribute NSLayoutAttribute.NotAnAttribute, multiplier 1, constant 150   if Doublehours  0       TimerLabel.text  strHoursstrMinutesstrSeconds.strFraction        TimerLabel.addConstraintwidthConstraint   codepre  pNow in my IBAction func for the reset button I also havep  precodelet widthConstraint2  NSLayoutConstraintitem TimerLabel, attribute NSLayoutAttribute.Width, relatedBy NSLayoutRelation.GreaterThanOrEqual, toItem nil, attribute NSLayoutAttribute.NotAnAttribute, multiplier 1, constant 110   TimerLabel.removeConstraintwidthConstraint  TimerLabel.addConstraintwidthConstraint2 codepre  pHowever once the timer resets the label appears as followsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSPHDP.png altenter image description herep  pThe text is no longer centre in the view.

Negative 59103 pI am trying to install a hrefhttpweb.mit.eduvondrickvatic relnofollowvatica. I kept on getting server errors and so I decided to have a look at the log and I found this. From what I understand, I need to change the import util statement as apparently there are a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11641777cannotimportnameutiltwo versions of utila and I need to specify the correct one.

Negative 59103 pI have an app with a root UITabBarController that contains a few UISplitViewControllers. Everything works as expected, except when the split view is collapsed I would like to be able to hide the tab bar. Im pushing the new detail view controller with code[self.splitViewController showDetailViewControllerdetailNav senderself]code and all attempts to call codehidesBottomBarWhenPushedcode have failed. Everything is laid out in code, I dont use storyboards.p  pIs this even possible, or am I stuck with the tab bar if I use a split view controller on an iPhonep
Negative 59103 pI want to run an oracle online backup through the rman setup in 12c. I have 3 scripts that need to be run and they arep  ul licoderman target sys[dbname][dbpassword] nocatalogcodeli licodeconfigure channel device type disk clearcodeli licodeRUN   ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE DISK FORMAT CUsersAdministratorDocumentsBackupU  BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG code li ul  pI want to be able to run them as a single entry through a c codeProcesscode object. I want to emulate using a command line and not a batch file. p  pSo, Ive looked at a few questionsanswers and have used codeampampcode to try and combine the commands but that didnt quite work. It took the first two commands and connected me to the RMAN center but the codeRUNcode command didnt execute most likely because of the codecode within that part of the script. p  pstrongEDIT  actually only the first command was run. The second did not execute.strongp  pMy question Is there a way that I can combine these 3 script items into 1 to run through the c codeProcess.Startcode method p
Negative 59103 pIm creating a commercial airline flight program and Im still learning how to get around with Java. So, I was wondering if there was any way to check if an array has enough consecutive positions to place values together in those positions in the array For example, I have an array of strings called seats, each position in this array corresponds to an available seat on the flight. Initially these seats are all empty.p  precodeString[] seats  new String[8] codepre  pIn the longrun, this program is going to be inserting values into this array and I want my program to be able to check if there are any empty seatspositions in the flightarray to assign a passenger to a seat. I sketched this to check.p  precodeforint i0 ilt seats.length1i  ifseats[i]  null       do something     else         system.out.printlnNo seats available        how do I not assign seats or accept more values to my array      codepre  pbut advised on using an objective approach, I got to thisp  precodeprivate static int MAXSEATS  8 private String[] seats  new String[MAXSEATS]  public boolean addPassengerString passengerName      for int i  0 i lt seats.length i          if seats[i]  null              seats[i]  passengerName             return true                   return false  codepre  pIf the program finds an empty seat after checking, It should then check again if there are empty consecutive seats. For example, if we wanted to make 3 passengers seat together, the program should check if there are empty 3 seats and then seat them there. If the program finds 3 consecutive positions in the array, it should randomly assign the passengers to whichever 3 position. otherwise it should randomly try another seat, repeating until successful. Right now, my array of seat can take up to 8 values, so the possible 3 positions could be code1,2,3 or 2,3,4 or 3,4,5 or 4,5,6 or 5,6,7code. If the program does not find a consecutive position to seat these 3 people, it should randomly place them in different positions.pick random seat numbers till it can find an empty seat emThis code is just adding passengers to the seats array .emp  precodeaccepting more values to the seats array public boolean addPassengersString... passengerNames      boolean everyoneAdded  true     for String passengerName  passengerNames          everyoneAdded  everyoneAdded ampamp addPassengerpassengerName          return everyoneAdded  codepre  pHow is it possible to check for strongconsecutive positionsstrong in an array in order to add groups of passengers randomly Any correctioncontribution would be helpful.p
Negative 59103 pWhat i was hoping i would break some functions down and skipping running multiple queries all the time.p  pNow if i have a ONEtoMULTI relationship between two tables. codetblinvoicescode and codetblinvoiceitemscode. Table codetblinvoiceitemscode has a different row for each item for a specific order.p  pWould it be possible with a SINGLE query from Codeigniter to get the item from the codetblinvoicescode and all the codetblinvoiceitemscode in an array in the same result p  pBasically JOIN the below queriesp  precodethisgtdbgtselect,tblinvoices.id AS invoiceid thisgtdbgtfromtblinvoices thisgtdbgtwheretblinvoices.id,invoiceid data  thisgtdbgtget   thisgtdbgtselect thisgtdbgtfromtblinvoiceitems thisgtdbgtwheretblinvoiceitems.invoiceid,invoiceid thisgtdbgtjointblproducts,tblproducts.id  tblinvoiceitems.itemid,left data  thisgtdbgtget codepre  pAlso would it be able in a ONEtoONE relationship tables return the other table as a custom variable  Something like codeSELECT tblclients. AS client, tblinvoices. FROM...JOIN...WHERE...etccodep
Negative 59103 pI have many rule constraints that can be logically grouped together by or. For example 3 rules r1, r2 and r3. I can construct a single LHS asp  precoder1  r2  r3 codepre  pOr I can make each of them a separate rule. I have no critical functional requirement for doing it either way since I can detect their grouping independently outside of Drools. p  pI wonder if one way is more advantageous than the other from runtime execution perspective performance, memory, etc.. p
