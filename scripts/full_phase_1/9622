Positive 9622 pI cracked my head trying to realize how Symfony and Doctrine fetch associated entities.p  pLets imagine i have several associated entitiesp  ul liCompany ManyToOne to Cityli liCity ManyToOne to Region, OneToMany to Companyli liRegion ManyToOne to Country, OneToMany to Cityli liCountry OneToMany to Regionli ul  pWhen i render Company form i create Form Event Listener on PRESETDATA that inserts Region and Country selectboxes to this form. The values in these fields must be set according to associated Region.p  pI retrieve current Company Region viap  precodecompany  eventgtgetData city  companygtgetCity codepre  pThat works goodp  pBut when i try thisp  precoderegion  citygtgetRegion  returns NULL country  regiongtgetCountry  returns NULL codepre  pthese methods returns NULL. But in fact all associations exists and Doctrine association mapping is correct. strongWhystrongp  pAccording to Doctrine documentation when i call getter for the proxy object these ovjects are proxies, right  Doctrine should fetch insufficient data from database and update the object. In fact  methods return NULLs.p  pstrongHow can i get any associated entity from any association deep levelstrongp

Positive 9622 pIn the class diagram a User can take multiple exams. An Exam is made up of several categories. Each Category has many questions. Each Question has many choices.p  pThe two places I have questions about are where the User interacts with the Exam.p  pA friend of mine said I should have an association class between User and Exam called Examination. I guess, as attributes, it could have DateTime and Score. Why cant Exam store the score and have a completion date  Doesnt that mean that when the exam is complete it simply changes states With this design i guess it will have to have an attribute for User as well. This will couple User and Exam.  If i need Examination to store the score, then will I need a CompletedCategory to store the individual scores for each Categoryp  pThe other place is the relationship between User and Question. Or should it be User and Choice I need somewhere to store the response to the questions before the score is calculated.  These responses have to be saved to the Database as well.

Positive 9622 pDuring last week I have been stuck with a scalingrelated problem in cakephp 3.0.p  pBasically, I designed a application for ecommerce that will serve several clients. Each store will sell its products in a specific subdomain client1.application.com client2.application.com, etc. All the stores will share the same application source.p  pI want to have a common database for user authentication and other common resources, like tables for cities, countries, etc, so that all users can access all ecommerce stores that use this application with same login information.p  pEach client will have a database with its specific resources, e.g. tables with products, sales, etc.p  pI found this interesting article a hrefhttpmarkstory.compostsviewusingcakephpandahorizontallyshardeddatabase relnofollowhttpmarkstory.compostsviewusingcakephpandahorizontallyshardeddatabasea and I already implemented that solution so that cakephp can know recognize the subdomain and select clients database as the default connection. I changed all the models users, etc. that I want to use the common database so that they always connect to the common database. And its working.p  pHowever, I still have a problem when it comes to associations in cakephp. For example each client has a table for administrators in their specific databases, that associates the Users table in the commonresources database so that when an administrator logs in, the application grants all the administration privileges for that subdomain. p  pTo sum up, the issue concerns associations between tables in different databases.

Negative 9622 pI am writing an application in C that needs to run as a service but also have user interaction.  I understand that services have no UI, etc, so Ive divided up my program into a windows form application and a service that can communicate with each other.p  pThe problem Im having is that I need the service to make sure the windows form application is always running and restart it if it is not.  Im able to detect if it is running, and restart it with the following code on Windows 2000XPp  precodeSystem.Diagnostics.Process.StartExePath codepre  pbut on Vista, it runs the new process as a LocalSystem process which is invisible to the user.

Something  anything  basic would suffice.p  pI would be grateful for any help or tips you have on the subject.p  pEDIT I need to clarify that I am setting the Allow service to interact with desktop option when the service is installed.  This is what allows it to work on 2000XP.  However, Vista still has the aforementioned problem.p

Negative 9622 pMigrations are undoubtedly better than just firing up phpMyAdmin and changing the schema willynilly as I did during my php days, but after using them for awhile, I think theyre fatally flawed.p  pstrongVersion control is a solved problem.strong The main function of migrations is to keep a history of changes to your database. But storing a different file for each change is a clumsy way to track them. You dont create a new version of codepost.rbcode or a file representing the delta when you want to add a new emvirtualem attribute  why should you create a new migration when you want to add a new nonvirtual attributep  pPut another way, just as you check codepost.rbcode into version control, why not check schema.rb into version control and make the changes to the file directlyp  pThis is functionally the same as keeping a file for each delta, but its much easier to work with. My mental model is I want table X to have such and such columns or really, I want model X to have such and such properties  why should you have to infer from this how to get there from the existing schema just open up codeschema.rbcode and give table X the right columnsp  pBut even the idea that classes wrap tables is an implementation detail Why cant I just open up codepost.rbcode and sayp  precode Class Post     t.string title     t.text body  end codepre  pIf you went with a model like this, youd have to make a decision about what to do with existing data. But even then, migrations are overkill  when you migrate data, youre going to lose fidelity when you use a migrations codedowncode method.p  pAnyway, my question is, strongeven if you cant think of a better way, arent migrations kind of grossstrongp

Negative 9622 pI have a legacy VB6 application that needs to make asynchronous calls to a web service. The web service provides a codesearchcode method allows endusers to query a central database and view the results from within the application. Im using the codeMSXML2.XMLHTTPcode to make the requests, and have written a codeSearchWebServicecode class that encapsulates the web service call and code to handle the response asychronously.p  pCurrently, the codeSearchWebServicecode raises one of two events to the caller codeSearchCompletedcode and codeSearchFailedcode. A codeSearchCompletedcode event is raised that contains the search results in a  parameter to the event if the call completes successfully. A codeSearchFailedcode is raised when any type of failure is detected, which can be anything from an improperlyformatted URL this is possible because the URL is userconfigurable, to lowlevel network errors such as Host not found, to HTTP errors such as internal server errors. It returns a error message string to the enduser which is extracted from the web service response body, if present, or from the HTTP status code text if the response has no body, or translated from the network error code if a network error occurs.p  pBecause of various security requirements, the calling application does not access the web service directly, but instead accesses it through a proxy web server running at the customer site, which in turn accesses the actual web service through via a VPN. However, the codeSearchWebServicecode doesnt know that the calling application is accessing the web service through a proxy its just given a URL and told to make the request. The existence of the proxy is a applicationlevel requirement.p  pThe problem is that from an enduser perspective, its important that the calling application be able to distinguish between lowlevel network errors versus HTTP errors from the web service, and to distinguish proxy errors from remote web server errors. For example, the application needs to know if a request failed because the proxy server is down, or because the remote web service that the proxy is accessing is down. An applicationspecific message needs to be presented to the enduser in each case, such as Search web service proxy server appears to be down. The proxy server may need to be restarted versus The proxy is currently running but the remote web server appears to be unavailable. Please contact name of person in charge of the remote web server. I could handle this directly in the codeSearchWebServicecode class, but it seems wrong to generate these applicationspecific error messages from such a generic class and the class might be used in environments that dont require a proxy, where the error messages would no longer make sense.p  pThis distinction is important for troubleshooting a proxy server problem can usually be resolved by the customer, but a remote web server error has to handled by a third party.p  pI was thinking one way to handle this would be to have the codeSearchWebServicecode class detect different types of errors and raise different events in each case. For example, instead of a single codeSearchFailedcode event, I could have a codeNetworkErrorcode event for lowlevel network errors which would indicate a problem accessing the proxy server, a codeConfigurationErrorcode event for invalid properties on the codeSearchWebServicecode class such as passing an improperlyformatted URL, and a codeServiceErrorcode for errors that occur on the remote web server implying that the proxy is working properly but the remote server returned an error.p  pNow that I think about it, there is also an additional error scenario it could be possible that the proxy server is running properly, but the remote web server is down, or the proxy server has been misconfigured.p  pIs the approach of using multiple error events to classify different classes of error a reasonable solution to this problem For the last scenario the proxy is running but the remote server cannot be reached, Im guessing I may have to set up the proxy to return a specific HTTP error code so that client can detect this situation i.e. something more specific than a 500 response.p  pOriginally I kept the single codeSearchFailedcode event and simply added an additional codeerrorCodecode parameter to the event, but that got messy quickly, especially in cases where there wasnt a logical error code to use such as if the VB6 raises a real error, i.e. if the XMLHTTP class isnt registered.p

After looking in Fiddler, the flash application type response data doesnt even show up for IE. It does however for Firefox. p  pI thought maybe it has to do with any kind of media, so i changed the chart type to output as a jpg file instead of flash. And it loads completely fine in IE.

Negative 9622 pIve got some MVC code that serializes an EF 3.5 object into an anonymous type for return as a JSON result to an AJAX call on my page.  The hurdle I have is that when I send the object back to the server via JSON, and let the ModelBinder deserialize it for me into my EF type, I have to update it in my Entity Framework context strongmanuallystrong.  Or at least thats what Im doing now.  It has no EntityKey, so attaching it fails.  I end up having to look up the old object and update it property by property.  Any ideas around this  Is the solution to pass the EntityKey around with my objectp  pstrongHeres what I havestrongp  precode    public void UpdateAlbum album              using var db  new BandSitesMasterEntities                      var albumToUpdate  db.Album.Firstx gt x.ID  album.ID              albumToUpdate.AlbumTitle  album.AlbumTitle             albumToUpdate.Description  album.Description             albumToUpdate.ReleaseYear  album.ReleaseYear             albumToUpdate.ImageURL  album.ImageURL             albumToUpdate.OtherURL  album.OtherURL              db.SaveChanges               codepre  pstrongAnd heres what Id like to dostrong, emor something similaremp  precode    public void UpdateAlbum album              using var db  new BandSitesMasterEntities                      db.Attachalbum             db.SaveChanges               codepre

Negative 9622 pI have a simple codeUIViewControllercode and a codeUISearchBarcode, when the view loads I want to have the search bar become the first responder right away so that the keyboard is showing and they can start typing their query right away.

Negative 9622 pI have a simple question about .net delegates. Say I have something like thisp  precode    public void InvokeActionltTgt action              Invoke gt actionthis.Value           public void InvokeAction action              mTaskQueue.Enqueueaction      codepre  pThe first function encloses a reference to codethis.Valuecode. During runtime, when the first, method with generic parameter gets called, it will provide codethis.Valuecode somehow to the second one, but how These came into my mindp  ul listrongCall by value structstrong  the current value of codethis.Valuecode gets passed, so if the codemTaskQueuecode executes it 5 minutes later, the value will not be in its recent state, it will be whatever it was when first referencing. li listrongCall by reference reference typestrong  then the most recent state of codeValuecode will be referenced during execution of action but if I change codethis.Valuecode to another reference before execution of action, it will still be pointing to the old referenceli listrongCall by name bothstrong  where codethis.Valuecode will be evaluated when the action gets called. I believe the actual implementation would be holding a reference to codethiscode then evaluate codeValuecode on that during actual execution of delegate since there is no call by name.li ul  pI assume it would be Call by name style but could not find any documentation so wondering if it is a well defined behavior. This class is something like an Actor in Scala or Erlang so I need it to be thread safe. I do not want codeInvokecode function to dereference codeValuecode immediately, that will be done in a safe thread for codethiscode object by codemTaskQueuecode.p  pThanks.p
Negative 9622 pOK, this one is a doozy.

When I ask for sampleobject.relatedsamples, it gives me whatever other Sample objects I assigned it.  p  pThe problem comes with the edit action for my views.  My goal is to allow a user to replace an existing related Sample object to a different one by selecting it from a list of all available Samples.  And I want to implement this if possible inside of a fieldsfor helper method, so that doing the update is really simple.  Im not sure how to implement this, or I even can.  Is it possible  And if so, howp

Negative 9622 pI prefer to have the exception handling logic further up in the call stack, near the main method. I like this approach... However, I created a thread where some of its method calls inside run may throw exceptions. I would really like to see if there is a way that these exceptions can be thrown back up to the parent thread The best I could think of is setting a variable inside the object that implements codeRunnablecode. This variable is a string that contains the Error Message, which then uses a class loader to correctly recreate the same exception in the parent thread.p  pWhat I would like to know, is there a less messy way of getting what I want here to be able to make sure that any exception thrown in a child thread is handled with the same exception handling logic as though it was running in the main threadcode reuse.p

Negative 9622 pAfter all the answers to my last a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2712668howtofinetunefluentnhibernatesautomapperquestion about finetuninga turned out to be more useful than I expected, I thought that I would ask another similar Question about the MembershipProviders as well.p  pOkay, so firstly, to clarify I know what a Membership, Role, and Profile provider is, how to implement my own, and how to configure them, and most of the things about them.br Implementing a role and profile provider is pretty straightforward, because they only require simple CRUD most of the time. A single line of LINQ is enough for about half of the RoleProviders methods.p  pHowever, the Membership provider is a differend beast. Many of you may realize that it violates the SR Single Responsibility principle, because it has to do EVERYTHING related to user management. While this leaves a lot of room for customizations, it has its downsides as well. There is no information on the Internet about what their EXACT expected behaviour is, such as when should they throw exceptions or simply return null, and stuff like that.p  pI use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6tc47t75.aspx relnofollowthis sample implementationa for reference, but it also contains several contradictions.p  ul liFor example, it uses its own ValidateUser method for checking for credentials in the ChangePassword method. But the ValidateUser also updates the users LastLoginDate to the current date. So, does the framework expect that I set it in my own provider as well, or is it simply a mistake in the sampleli liThe other is the ChangePassword method throws an exception every time when validating the new password, but CreateUser doesnt ever throw an exception, it simply returns false.li lipAnd last, but not least it counts the invalid password attempts of the user and locks them if it passes a threshold. While this is good, but it requires manual action to unlock the users. Is it a problem if my provider automatically unlocks the user after a certain amount of timepli lipEDIT I almost forgot the CreateUser method in the sample inserts the ID from the method parameter. I actually think this is bad practice, because I use inters with auto incement as IDs, so inserting them from some method parameter is not an option. Should I just ignore the parameter, or require that its value is null and throw an exception if it isntpli ul  pAll in all, does ASP.NET have any assumptions about the behaviour of a MembershipProviderbr Is there any documentation which describes when should I throw an exception or just return nullp  pI also tried to find a set of generic unit tests which would provide some guidance about the expected behaviour, but no luck, I found plenty of articles about Unit testing is good, and How to unit test a MembershipProvider, but not one where there would be any actual tests.p  pThanks in advance for everyonep

Negative 9622 pFeel like Im going a bit nutty here. I have a detail view with a few standalone codeUITextFieldcodes, a few codeUITextFieldscode in codeUITAbleViewCellcodes, and one single codeUITableViewCellcode that will be used to hold notes, if there are any. I only want this cell selectable when I am in edit mode. When I am not in edit mode, I do not want to be able to select it. Selecting the cell while in edit mode will fire a method that will init a new view. I know this is very easy, but I am missing something somewhere.p  pHere are the current selection methods I am usingp  precodeNSIndexPath tableViewUITableView tableView willSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      if self.editing          NSLogReturning nil, not in edit mode         return nil          NSLogCell will be selected, not in edit mode     if indexPath.section  0          NSLogComments cell will be selected         return indexPath          return nil   voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      if self.editing          NSLogNot in edit mode.

From my understanding of the codewillSelectRowAtIndexPathcode method, this shouldnt be happening. Maybe I am wrong about thisp  p2 When I enter edit mode, I cant select anything at all. the codewillSelectRowAtIndexPathcode method never fires, and neither does the codedidSelectRowAtIndexPathcode. The only thing I am doing in the codesetEditingcode method, is hiding the back button while editing, and assigning codefirstRespondercode to the top textField to get the keyboard to pop up.  I thought maybe the first responder was getting in the way of the click which would be dumb, but even with that commented out, I cannot perform the cell selection during editing.p

Negative 9622 pBased on the information I have provided below, can you give me your opinion on whether its a good idea to denormalize separate tables into one table which holds different types of contracts..

Negative 9622 pSo Ive been thinking about PIMPL and stack allocation. Ive been writing a library and decided to use PIMPL to hide the private member of the class. That means I would have a class declared like thisp  precodeclass Foo  private     class Handle     stdtr1sharedptrltHandlegt handle public     Foo  codepre  pIts pretty straight forward. But then in the constructor you do thisp  precodeFooFoo  handlenew Handle  codepre  pSo when someone using my library creates a Foo on the stack, they are essentially doing a heap allocation anyway. Is this the tradeoff you have to live with when using PIMPL I thought of releasing the documentation with a warning next to constructors WARNING This results in a heap allocation or somesuch. p  pMy other thought was to have all classes which are exposed to the implementation as pure virtual interfaces and a whole bunch of static factory methods returning smart pointers. This also means heap allocation but there is no trick to it.p  pAny thoughts or suggestions Am I being overlyconsiderate of programmers using my libraryp

Negative 9622 pI have a table to store data for the phones and it has about 50 columns .......... should be inserted on average 30 million phones in one year ........ however, it is necessary to store a history of these phones, for example, if I want to change a field in a phone at a given date, latter I need to know at any given time, the values that had this phone. It occurred to me to have a historical and a main table, where in the main, I have the latest values of the cell, and in the historical all the changes that were made. Now this is a duplication of data, because if you change only one field, I insert into the historical table all the values, even those not changed, and in the main,this last record, so the historical table will grow enormously. how could I manage to not store too much information that may not be changed and retrieve data from a phone at any given time.p

Negative 9622 pfull EDITp  pI will give some more information about the whole problem. The project is in early stage and my question is actually only about a narrow portion of the thing.p  pthe final goalbr I am currently trying to simulate the flow of hot air around a rigid obstacle in Python. I have a steady inflow of air, the flow in the bulk is transient and turbulent. The aim of the whole exercise is to understand howbr the air flow behavesbr the obstacle heats upbr the air cools down and the airpressure dropsp  pdone so farbr Not much, the thing is in early stage. I have a 2d rectangular domain and a circular obstacle. The mesh is getting finer at the boundary between bulk and obstacle, since that is where the interesting stuff is happening. Currently I only consider the airflow, no convection or heat transfer. I use the a hrefhttpwww.fenicsproject.org relnofollowFEniCSa software collection to solve the NavierStokes equation. Fenics comes with an example for an NS solver using the Chorin projection method, I adapted this example to my setting. I model the rigid body as an area with noslip boundary condition i.e. I set the velocity of the air flow to zero. The solver still solves the NS equation in that area, in particular the pressure inside the obstacle changes over time. Probably it is a better idea to avoid this and restrict the NS solver to the bulk. But at the moment I dont think this affects the speed very much.p  pproblembr The thing runs quite slow. I do not mind if the final simulations takes a few days, but currently it is only 2d fluid flow around an obstacle and the mesh is not as fine as I want it to be in the end. I hoped this to be faster, as it will become a lot more complicated when the heat comes into play. p  pmy questionbr It boils down to one questionp  pWhat is a fast algorithm or method to solve the NavierStokes equation in Pythonp  pI am perfectly fine with writing a solver from scratch, but this raises the same question. This morning it occured to me that the projection method is maybe not the worst idea, because it decouples the pressure and velocity upgrade, I could try to assign this to different CPU kernels.p

Negative 9622 pUPDATE  SOLUTION p  pSorry to be posting the solution here instead of in a comment, but something about my works filtering doesnt allow the comment functionality to work for me.p  pI ended up using the b 0.0.0.0 property in jboss to bind to all addresses, so I could try accessing machine As server with machine B as the client, and viceversa.  I found that it always failed to load when running on machine B, whether or not I was connecting from A or B.  p  pI started wireshark on a windows machine on the same network, and observed the TCP connection that was loading the webpage.  I saw that the request for the .swf in the cases where it failed had a content length of 2 million or so, and when I right clicked the wireshark logs and selected view conversation or something like that, the size of the total conversation to get the .swf file was only 130,000.  Looking at aboutcache, that was about equal to what it ended up caching before saying Done on the page.p  pI ended up finding that there is a bug with the useSendFile property.  httpcommunity.jboss.orgthread148651tstart0.  This causes it to only send part of the file if you are running low on kernel memory.  Using useSendFilefalse in our server.xml has seemed to resolve the problem.p  pp  pOriginal problemp  pI have a flash .swf file that loads intermittently in Firefox on Solaris 10.  I have tried Firefox 2 and 3, and Flashplayer 10 and 10.1 on various Solaris patch levels, and none have worked consistently.  It seems to be a caching issue, but I dont know what I need to do to fix it.p  pUpon starting firefox with a freshly cleared cache, and going to my webpage on localhost that contains the swf, I can see the Firefox does a GET request to the JBoss server to get the swf file.  The contenttype is properly recognized as applicationxshockwaveflash and the contentLength of the response is 2240830 with a status of 200, signifying that the whole file was sent.  After this response, the page appears as a black background with the flash Loading bar, which is about 5 complete.  At this point, I would have expected it to show up because it did get the full file.p  pWhen I go to aboutcache after this and look at Disk Cache entries, I see a Data size of 196608 bytes, so it seems like it has cached only part of the file.  p  pSince it has not loaded in the window, I do a refresh of the browser.  I see it request in the header range bytes field 196608  so it looks like it is requesting what it does not have cached.  The application server responds with a correct content type, status of 206 partial content, and a length of 2044222.  Refreshing the cache, it is now listed as 393216 bytes.p  pI do another refresh, get another partial content response, and then my flash file is loaded.  In aboutcache, I see the data size as 2240830, the size of the original response with a status of 200.p  pWhy did my flash file not load after the first response the one with a 200 OK status that returned the full file.  Why would it cache only part of it, and why would it not automatically request the rest of the filep  pEverything works fine on the Windows install with the same version of the .swf file, the same version of the application server, and the same version of firefox and flash player.p  pEDIT Since Im having trouble posting comments in reply, Ill just add here.  There is no debug version for Solaris.  I have one on Windows, but it works fine there.  It does work on Solaris after a few refreshes, and the wrong size in the cache in Firefox leads me to believe its probably an issue with caching.p

Negative 9622 pYoull have to excuse me if Im describing this incorrectly, but essentially Im trying to get a servicelike class to be instantiated just once at server start and to sort of exist in the background until it is killed off at server stop. At least from what I can tell, this is not exactly the same as a typical servlet though I may be wrong about this. Whats even more important is that I need to also be able to access this serviceobject later down the line.p  pAs an example, in another project Ive worked on, we used the Spring Framework to accomplish something similar. Essentially, we used the configuration XML file along with the builtin annotations to let Spring know to instantiate instances of some of our services. Later down the line, we used the annotation Autowired to sort of grab the object reference of this preinstantiated serviceobject.p  pSo, though it may seem against some of the major concepts of Java itself, Im just trying to figure out how to reinvent this wheel here. I guess sometimes I feel like these big app frameworks do too much blackbox magic behind the scenes that Id really like to be able to finetune.p  pThanks for any help andor suggestionsp  hr  pOh and Im trying to run this all from JBoss 6p

Negative 9622 pThis certainly is a strange one...p  pI have an ASP.net 4.0, C website that has a login page using FormsAuthentication to handle user access.  Theres also code throughout the site that boots the user back to the login page whenever a session times out or something else that requires them to login again happens.  This is all really basic stuff that Ive done about a dozen times before.p  pI know this whole process is working, because Ive been able to login to the site running through VS2010 on EVERY browser I tried.  It also works perfectly fine when its sitting on the development server using Chrome, Firefox, Safari Mac, and two Cellphone browsers.  The only thing Ive had a problem with is Internet Explorer.p  pNow, this one is a bit hard to debug considering it works in IE locally but not on the server.  The fact that it also works in other browsers on the server is also sort of ruling out a server configuration issue.p  pWhat I did to try and figure out where it could be going wrong was add a query string to my FormsAuthentication.RedirectToLoginWhateverPageWhateverSectionOfCode line to try and solve this.  The problem is that when I run the site in IE, it never appends that Query String, which leads me to believe that it never hits any of those RedirectToLogin lines.p  pI know it authenticates, because the code that updates the Last Login timestamp in the database only fires if the user is authenticated.  It looks as if the RedirectFromLogin line does go out and find the proper entry in the web.config...and it might actually be redirecting me, but even if it does, it always bounces me back to the login screen.p  pIve been through all of the really basic ID10T errors heh that could possibly be causing this Heightened security settings, disabled cookies, etc., but Im getting the same results on multiple machines.p  pIm really sort of stumped as to what to check for next.  Ive already had two other sets of eyes on the code, but they couldnt come up with any reason as to why this was happening.  If anyone has any suggestions as to what could be happening, Id love to hear them.p  pThanksp

Theyre just for fun  education.p  pThe current challenge is one of the more advanced ones, and involves some trickery that makes it look like the EP is actually in the normal program, but its actually packed away in another PE section.p  pHeres the basic flowp  ul liStarts out as if it were a normal MSVC application.li liInjected a sneaky call away to a bunch of antidebugger tricks.li liIf they pass, a DWORD in memory is set to 1.li liLater in the program flow, it checks for that value being 1, and if it works it decrypts a small call table. If it fails, it sends them off on a wild goose chase of fake antidebug tricks and eventually just crashes.li liThe call table points to the real decryption routines that decrypt the actual program code section.li liThe decryption routines are called, and they decrypt using a basic looped xor Ckn where C is ciphertext, k is a 32bit key and n is the current data offsetli liVirtualProtect is used to switch the sections protection flags from RW to RX.li liControl flow is redirected to OEP, program runs.li ul  pThe idea is that since they think theyre in normal program flow, it makes them miss the antidebug call and later checks. Anyway, that all works fine.p  pstrongPROBLEMstrongp  pThe current problem is that OllyDbg and a few other tools look at the packed section and see that it has high entropy, and throw up a warning that its packed. The code section pointer in the PE header is correctly set, so it doesnt get this from having EP outside code  its purely an entropy analysis thing.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrongp  pIs there an encryption method I can use that preserves low entropy, but is still easy to implement in x86 asm I dont want to use a plain xor, since its too easy, but I also dont want it to catch it as packed and give the game away.p  pI thought of something like a shuffler somehow produce a keystream and use it to swap 4byte blocks of code around, but Im not sure that this is going to work, or even be simple.p  pAnyone got any ideasp

Negative 9622 pI have a problem with links on my website. Please forgive me if this is asked somewhere else, but I have no idea how to search for this.p  pA little background on the current situation Ive created a python program that randomly generates planets for a scifi game. Each created planet is placed in a text file to be viewed at a later time. The program asks the user how many planets heshe wants to create and makes that many text files. Then, after all the planets are created, the program zips all the files into a file worlds.zip. A link is then provided to the user to download the zip file.p  pThe problem The first time I run this everything works perfectly fine. When run a second time, however, and I click the link to download the zip file it gives me the exact same zip file as I got the first time. When I ftp in and download the zip file directly I get the correct zip file, despite the link still being bad.p  pThings Ive tried When I refresh the page the link is still bad. When I delete all my browser history the link is still bad. Ive tried a different browser and that didnt work. Ive attempted to delete the file from the web server and that didnt solve the problem. Changing the html file providing the link worked once, but didnt work a second time. p  pSimplified Question How can I get a link on my web page to update to the correct filep  pIve spent all day trying to fix this. I dont mind looking up information or reading articles and links, but I dont know how to search for this, so even if you guys just give me links to other sites Ill be happy although directly answering my question will always be appreciated .p

Negative 9622 pI have a standard WiFi h.264 camera that I use as a baby monitor which, in technical terms, means I need it to be as realtime as possible. My initial goal was to encode the stream from the camera as such that the native iPhone hardware decoder can be used so that the result is a direct, clean, sharp, and realtime video from my camera onto my iPhone. I really want to avoid using FFMPEG since its a software decoder, which is slower then a hardware decoder.p  pI am finidng that the iPhone will not take anything from the cameras stream unless I use HLS as a middleman server.

If you need any more details, please let me know.p  pAgain, your help means a lot since I have been beating myself up on this for over 6 months now.p

Negative 9622 pIm wondering about the correctness of the following code in terms of lifecycle management and memory management that results from itp  precodeorg.w3c.dom.Document document   some document   Some longrunning loop for       This element has document as its owner. But it is never added as a child    element into the document. It can be GCed at the end of the loop   Element abc  document.createElementabc  codepre  pSuch temporary elements or codeDocumentFragmentcode, etc. may be used in extensive DOM manipulations quite often. In Xerces, which is Javas standard DOM implementation, the element holds a reference to the document, but the document is unaware of Element. This allows for the garbage collector to clean up those elements when their scope is cleared i.e. at the end of the loop. But this is not documented explicitly as such in the API. On the other hand, I dont see any operation in the DOM API allowing for unsetting codeabccodes owner document. p  pMy question is Am I right in assuming that a DOM document may never keep references to the nodes it creates with codecreateXXXcode, regardless of the implementation Or is there any implementation where the above might lead to a memory leakp

Ive got the recursive part down I feel, but I need some insight on how to compare the current sequence of characters to the dictionary.p  pIm required to store the dictionary in either a set or sorted list. Ive been trying a way to implement this using a set. In order to make the program run faster and not follow dead end paths, I need to check and see if the current sequence of characters exists as a prefix to anything in the set dictionary.p  pIve found that set.find operation only returns true if the string is an exact match. In the lab requirements, the professor mentioned that p  pIf the dictionary is stored in a Set, many data structure libraries provide a way to find the string in the Set that is closest to the one you are searching for. Such an operation could be used to quickly find a word with a given prefix.p  pIve been searching today for a what the professor is describing. Ive found a lot of information on tries, but since Im required to use a list or set, I dont think that will work.p  pIve also tried looking up algorithms for autocomplete functions, but the ones that Ive found seem extremely complicated for what Im trying to accomplish here.p  pI also was thinking of using strncmp to compare the current sequence to a word from the dictionary set, but again, I dont know how exactly that would function in this situation, if at all.p  pIs it worth it to continue investigating how this would work in a set or should I just try using a sorted list to store my dictionaryp  pThanksp

Negative 9622 pMost of languages, using garbage collectors possibly all of them, have one major issue related to parallel computations garbage collector has to stop all running threads in order to delete unused objects. Haskell has garbage collector too. But, due to purity, Haskell guarantees that every computation does not change the original data, it produces a copy instead, and then makes the changes. I suppose, in that way, GC does not has to stop all threads to do own job. Im just curious, has the Haskell same issue with garbage collection or not.p

Negative 9622 pI wanted to get some feedback on your thoughts of storing entire objects into a session For example, a customer object. Once a customer logs into their control panel, instead of refetching their data each time it is needed from a ID stored in a session, what are the pros and cons of storing the entire customer object in a sessionp  pSo anytime you needed to reference the customer object, you could just dop  precodeCustomer c  CustomerSession[objCustomer] codepre  pObviously, you would need to check and have a function that refreshes the session.

And if you use Express.js is because it offers more tools than Node.js, like authentication, session control, data base,etc.p  pHow do you mix it up i have seen some examples on internet like this book OReilly Mediap  pa hrefhttpaddyosmani.github.combackbonefundamentals relnofollowhttpaddyosmani.github.combackbonefundamentalsap  pspecifically, on their github source code related to option7 for a TodoList app.p  pHere, they mix up both technologies Backbone.js and Express.js with MongoDB. They do data persistant between client and server, connection to Redis, etc, Bbut i still dont understand why they use Jade and views for main HTML templating on Express.js, but CSS, jQuery and images inside public on Backbone.js.B p  pShouldnt we build up the HTML5,CSS3 and JS entirely in Backbone.js Whats the point of inyecting HTML templates from the backend through ROUTES, if you want all your MVC on the frontendp  pthank you very much and hope to get an answer p

Negative 9622 pCurrently I am creating an app. for the ipad that uses a media player. When you click on a button the media player pops up and I have code that when you press another button the media player stops and is hidden so you can go back to using the superview. The problem is, I dont want to have to click a button to close the subview, I want to be able to click anywhere on the background to close. Ive tried making the whole background a button but Im having trouble writing code to make it so that the full window button that closes the subview ONLY appears when the subview is up. Right now the full window button is up constantly so I cant click on the button that brings up the subview in the first place because the large button is overlapping. I hope this dilemma is fairly easy to understand. If not I can send some code.p

Negative 9622 pI have a parent view with 3 separate child views. The child views are spread out within the parent with no overlap and with some space in between. As a user moves her finger around the screen without lifting it, Id like to track touches as they enter and exit each of the child views.p  pstrongExamplestrong If the user begins touching somewhere on the screen outside of the child views, then swipes her finger over child 1, off of child 1, over child 2, and then lets go, I would expect these events to be triggeredp  ol liTouch beganli liTouch entered child 1li liTouch exited child 1li liTouch entered child 2li liTouch endedli ol  pIt seems as if touchesBeganwithEvent and touchesEndedwithEvent methods would be helpful in this case, but when I define them on the child view controllers, they dont do exactly what I want  if the user begins touching outside the child view, then swipes over the child view, no touch events are triggered on the child itself.p  pstrongCurrent Solutionstrong Im currently using a solution that feels really hacky to accomplish this. Im observing touchesBeganwithEvent, touchesEndedwithEvent, and touchesMovedwithEvent on the parent, grabbing the coordinates of each event, and determining if they lie within the bounds of a child. If they do, I trigger the appropriate events as described above.p  pThis method mostly works, but feels very inefficient. It feels like the framework should handle this work for me. My state management code also sometimes misses an enter or exit trigger and I suspect its because touch events were either dropped or came to me in an unexpected order. Am I missing a better method herep

And C, like most lowlevel languages, has strict rules about allocation of memory..p blockquote  pWhat I knew that PHP was well errorchecked and so buffer overflow wasnt possible.

Negative 9622 pNormally, I have a more technical problem but I will simplify it for you with an example of counting balls.p  pAssume I have balls of different colors and one index of an array initialized to all 0s reserved for each color. Every time I pick a ball, I increment the corresponding index by 1.p  pBalls are picked randomly and I can only pick one ball at a time. My sole purpose is to count number of balls for every color, until I run out of balls.p  pI would like to calculate standard deviation of the number of balls of different colors, emwhile I am counting themem. I do not want to calculate it by having to iterate through the array once more after I am done with counting all the balls.p  pTo visualizep  pBalls in random order codeBBGRRYYBBGGGGGGBcode each letter represents first letter of a color Array indices from 0 to 3 correspond to colors B, G, R and Y respectively. When I am done picking the balls, my array looks like code[5,7,2,2]code.p  pIt is very simple to calculate standard deviation after having the final array but I want to do it while I am filling this array. p  pI want to do it in Java and I have approximately 1000 colors.p  pWhat is the most efficient way to implement that Or is there even a way to do it before having the final array in handp

Negative 9622 pI was messing around in ObjectiveC earlier, and I ran into a quite common situationp  pI had a class, which was not a singleton, that needed a variable shared between method calls, like codestaticcode, but each instance needed its own variable. However, this variable only needed to be used in one particular method, well call it codefoocode.p  pWhat Id love to do, is have a macro, lets call it codeivarcode, which lets me do the followingp  precodeimplementation MyClass   foo      ivar int someVal  10  default value, ivar scoped variable.   bar      someVal  5  error, outside of foos scope.   end codepre  pHow the variable is defined does not matter to me either a macro like codeOBJCIVARType, Name, Defaultcode or codeivar someType someName  valuecode, as long as it meets the following requirementsp  ul liHas thread safetyli liCan have variable of same name but different value in another methodli liTypeless doesnt matter what type the variable isli liDefault Value supportli liVariable can be declared in one line I shouldnt have to write 15 lines of code just to put a variable in my codeli ul  pI am currently working on an ObjectiveC implementation myself, I was just wondering if anyone else had any thoughts or existing tools on how to do this.p  pObviously, this doesnt have to be done with a true iVar. More likely, this should be done with associated objects at runtime, which also manages deallocation for us.p
Negative 9622 pIve got the following scenariop  pOn the one hand, Ive got a tomcat instance with a lot of applications that need the activemqall.jar which contains slf4j libraries, so Ive deployed it into the lib directory, it is not optional for me to include this jar file on each app.p  pOn the other hand I need to install a monitor application which I cant control and ships with a different version of slf4j.p  pRunning the last application on another tomcat instance is also not an option.p  pI would like to configure tomcats ClassLoader to try and load first the jars on the webapps and then the jars on the lib directory. p  pIs this possible How can be achievedp
Negative 9622 pI need to query a RESTful service that always returns a JSON response. I need to contact it a few times, always with some more information that I learned from the previous request. Im using Akka2, Scala, Jerkson and SprayCan.p  pMy current approach seems to work, but it looks ugly and requires nesting everything.

Contact the REST service, read it, on success parse it into a JSON case class, extract information out and then do the next call.p  pMy structure here is only twolevels deep but I need to add a third level as well.p  pIs there a technique available to improve this for better readability or can I only stick with this If you need any further information Im happy to provide it.

Negative 9622 pIm developing a webpage where users can filter data and then export the selection to pdf or excel. The website is using ASP .NET C.p  pTo filter the data I have crated a webpage containing a left column with boxes and drop downs enabling users to enter search criteria and then click a search button. This is the typical searchfilter functionality that a lot of websites contains. After filtering the data, the selecting is displayed using an asp listview. This listview generates a table. Ive implemented a hrefhttpjebaird.comblogdragtablejqueryuiwidgetrearrangetablecolumnsdragdrop relnofollowDragtablea, enabling users to alter the sequence of the columns in this table, and also the a hrefhttpp.sohei.orgjquerypluginscolumnmanager relnofollowcolumnManagera enabling users to select which columns to display.p  pSo my problem is that the filtersearch functionality is resolved backend using asp .net C, while the selecting and rearranging of columns is done clientside using jQuery. When users now click the exportbutton, Id like to collect the filter done by the asp controls in addition to the filter done by jQuery, and create the file. This file should only contain the columns selected using columnManager, in the same order they are in after being altered using dragtable.p  pWhat is best practice when using both server side filter and client side filter Ive also considered to drop all of the serverside filtering and use only ajax.post to send all filters in JSON format to the server. I also want to enable users to save their current filter for another time.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIve decided to drop the server side and use ajax getJSON to be more precisely to get the search result. This way I dont loose the ordering and sorting of columns that is done with jQueryjs, which I would with a postback could use cookiesn stuff, of course. I also keep all the logic in one place, and JSON objects can easily be wrappedunwrapped serverside. Thanks for your answers, thoughp
Negative 9622 pIm getting into Jekyll in a big way and would like to use it as a general frontend development platform, but am running up against the limitations of the Liquid templating language, specifically its difference to Django templating.p  pI discovered the liquidinheritance gem, which adds the allimportant Extends and Block syntax from Django. This blog post extends the gem further to suit Jekylls file system a hrefhttpwww.sameratiani.com20111022getjekyllworkingwithliquidinheritance.htmlhttpwww.sameratiani.com20111022getjekyllworkingwithliquidinheritance.htmlap  pThe problem is that it doesnt appear to implement blocks in exactly the same way Django does, which essentially renders the gem useless.p  pI have two jekyll layouts called  for the sake of understanding  parent.html and child.html. Neither of these contain YAML sections.p  pParentp  precodelthtmlgt  block foo   endblock  lthtmlgt codepre  pChildp  precode extends layoutsparent.html   block foo    ltdivgt     Bar comes next      block bar   endblock    ltdivgt  endblock  codepre  pAnd then I have a jekyll page which includes a YAML section thusp  precode title test    extends layoutschild.html   block bar My title is  page.title   endblock  codepre  pWhat Id expectp  precodelthtmlgt   ltdivgt     Bar comes next     My title is test   ltdivgt lthtmlgt codepre  pWhat I getp  precodelthtmlgt   ltdivgt     Bar comes next   ltdivgt lthtmlgtMy title is test codepre  pIt seems something is failing to treat the blocks in mypage.html as being eligible for insertion into the suitable places of parentchild, although its clearly still doing something.p  pIm not a ruby developer and am reasonably new to Jekyll, so I need help identifying what part of this stack is failing. The liquidinheritance issues on github suggest others are experiencing this block nesting problem a hrefhttpsgithub.comdanwrongliquidinheritanceissues3httpsgithub.comdanwrongliquidinheritanceissues3ap  pIve tried several of the forks of liquidinheritance, many of which apparently fix that problem regex, but none seem to solve this.p  pIs what im tring to do fundamentally impossible It seems like Im at least 85 of the way there and the final bit needs fixing.p

Negative 9622 pSorry for the two fold question in one post.p  pThis indirectly relates to a question I posted recently here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13327813vbareturnpagenumberfromselectionfindusingtextfromarrayvba return page number from selection.find using text from arraya which was solvedp  pProgram purposep  pFirstly add a footer with custom page numbers to documents i.e. 0.0.0, Chapter.Section,Page representative in a selected folder and sub folders.p  pSecondly create a TOC with the custom page numbers saved as roottoc.docx in the root folder selected.p  pI now have two new problems before I can fully clean and finally put this to bed, I will post the full code at the end of this post. p  pstrongSolvedstrong First of all, from what I have discovered and just read elsewhere too the codegetCrossReferenceItemsrefTypeHeadingcode method will only return the text upto a certain length from what of finds. I have some pretty long headings which means this is quite an annoyance for the purpose of my code. So the first question I have is is there something I can do with the codegetCrossReferenceItemsrefTypeHeadingcode method to force it to collect the full text from any referenced headings or is there an alternative way round this problem. p  pstrongSolvedstrong Secondly the codecreateOutlinecode function when called in codeChooseFoldercode produces the correct results but in reverse order, could someone point the way on this one too please.p  pUnfortunately the actual results I am recieving will be difficulty to exactly replicate but if a folder is made containing a couple of documents with various headings. The directory name should be the the same as what is in the Unit Array i.e. Unit1 Unit 1, the file names are made up of two parts i.e. Unit1 amp   amp Criteria1 amp ext becoming Unit 1 p1.docx etc, the arrays strongUnitstrong and strongCriteriastrong are in the codeChooseFoldercode Sub. strongchapArrstrong is a numerical representative of the strongUnitstrong array contents soley for my page numbering system, I used another array because of laziness at this point in time. I could have used some other method on the Unit array to achieve the same result which I might look at when cleaning up. p  pWhen running the ChooseFolder Sub if the new folder with documents in is located in My Document then strongMy Documentsstrong will be the folder to locate and select in the file dialogue window. This should produce results that are similar and will give an example of what I am talking about. p  pComplete codep  precodePublic Sub ChooseFolder   Declare Variables     Applications     Dim doc As Word.Document     Strings     Dim chapNum As String     Dim sResult As String     Dim Filepath As String     Dim strText As String     Dim StrChapSec As String     Integers     Dim secNum As Integer     Dim AckTime As Integer     Dim FolderChosen As Integer     Arrays     Dim Unit As Variant     Dim ChapArray As Variant     Dim Criteria As Variant     Ranges     Dim rng As Range     Objects     Dim InfoBox As Object     Dialogs     Dim fd As FileDialog   Constants     Const ext  .docx   Set Variable Values     secNum  0 Set Section number start value     AckTime  1 Set the message box to close after 1 seconds     Set InfoBox  CreateObjectWScript.Shell Set shell object     Set fd  Application.FileDialogmsoFileDialogFolderPicker Set file dialog object     FolderChosen  fd.Show Display file dialogue   Set Array Values   ToDo create form to set values for Arrays     Folder names     Unit  ArrayUnit 1, Unit 2     Chapter Numbers     chapArr  Array1, 2     Document names     Criteria  ArrayP1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, M1, M2, M3, M4, D1, D2, D3      If FolderChosen ltgt 1 Then         didnt choose anything clicked on CANCEL         MsgBox You chose cancel     Else         Set sResult equal to selected filefolder in file dialogue         sResult  fd.SelectedItems1     End If       Loop through unit array items     For i  LBoundUnit To UBoundUnit         unitName  Uniti          Test unit folder being looked at and concatenate sResult with          unitName delimited with          If unitName  Unit 105 Then             Filepath  sResult amp unit 9         Else             Filepath  sResult amp  amp unitName         End If          Loop through criteria array items         For j  LBoundCriteria To UBoundCriteria             criteriaName  Criteriaj              Set thisFile equal to full file path             thisfile  Filepath amp  amp unitName amp   amp criteriaName amp ext Create file name by concatenating filePath with space criteriaName and ext              Test if file exists             If FileExiststhisfile  True Then                  If file exists do something i.e. process number of pagesmodify document start page number                  Inform user of file being processed and close popup after 3 seconds                 Select Case InfoBox.PopupProcessing file   amp thisfile, AckTime, This is your Message Box, 0                     Case 1, 1                 End Select                  Open document in word using generated filePath in readwrite mode                  Process first section footer page number and amend to start as intPages total pages   1                 Set doc  Documents.Openthisfile                 With doc                     With ActiveDocument.Sections1                         chapNum  chapArri                         secNum  secNum  1                          Retrieve current footer text                         strText  .FooterswdHeaderFooterPrimary.Range.Text                         .PageSetup.DifferentFirstPageHeaderFooter  False                          Set first page footer text to original text                         .FooterswdHeaderFooterFirstPage.Range.Text  strText                          Set other pages footer text                         .FooterswdHeaderFooterPrimary.Range.Text  Date amp vbTab amp Author Robert Ells amp vbTab amp chapNum amp . amp secNum amp .

Negative 9622 pI just installed IE10 on my Windows 7, and Ive noticed that, even if Im glad that XMLs from AJAX requests are now compatible DOM documents, a rather basic function like codedocument.evaluatecode is emstillem not supported.p  pWhats worse is that, since those XMLs are emnotem the custom Microsoft codeIXMLDocumentcode objects, the nodes dont support codeselectNodescode and codeselectSingleNodecode anymore. strongIn the end, it seems that IE10 does not support DOM Level 3 XPath or MSXML Xpath.strongp  pSeriously, Microsoft Is there something Im missingp  pSure, I can use codequerySelectorcode and codequerySelectorAllcode, but I dont want to lose quite a bit of backward compatibility.p  pstrongOtherwisestrong, one can still request a MSXML document using this linep  precodetry xhr.responseType  msxmldocument catche  codepre  pas stated a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combiearchive20120719xmlhttprequestresponsexmlinie10releasepreview.aspx relnofollowherea, but I think it would be nice to deal with, at last, a standard DOM document in IE too.p  pSo, is there a way to use XPath in IE10 with standard DOM documentsp  pstrongUPDATE 2672013strong IE11 isnt stable yet, but it emstillem doesnt support codedocument.evaluatecode. If it wont support it in the stable release, I doubt it will emeverem support it. Needless to say this is ridicolous.p  pI get that you can use codequerySelectorcodecodeAllcode in DOM nodes, but its not supported in IE9 and lower, which are still quite commonly used, and anyway XPath is more powerful than selectors.p  pFortunately if you can say that, you can still set codexhr.responseType  msxmldocumentcode. For a moment I feared you couldnt do that anymore...p  pstrongUPDATE 23112013strong IE11 is stable now but, sadly, it doesnt support codedocument.evaluatecode. As heavyweight XML documents are used less and less in web applications in favor of JSON or other light notation formats, this is becoming less of a problem, but still.p  pSetting the coderesponseTypecode property still provides legacy XML documents, so nothing is lost I guess. I dont know if that will stay true for IE12, though.p  pstrongUPDATE 1582015strong Sounds ridiculous right now, but Edge now supports codedocument.evaluatecode.

Negative 9622 pFor my current project Im reading a xml config file using a hrefhttppyxb.sourceforge.net relnofollowpyxba. But it should be possible to override some of the settings by giving command line arguments parsed using argparse.br To get more readable code, I would like to use an universal approach and define an update method. The parameter update has to use a trycatchblock, because pyxb does validate the new value on assignment check string against pattern in this case.  p  pHere is what I triedp  precodedef overridesetupexp, args     for param, arg in [[exp.param1, args.param1], [exp.param2, args.param2]]         if arg is None             continue           this doesnt work, because param just references the string object referenced by exp.param1         try                             param  arg         except Exception as e             print e       the following works     exp.param1  stuff codepre  pIm creating a list containing the mapping of pyxb parameters to argparse command line arguments. I think this is where everything starts to get wrong.br I want some way to do this update using some kind of loop so I dont need to repeat the trycatchblock for every element.br Unfortunately exp doesnt seem to be iterable. Each child of exp has a member codegetDiagnosticNamecode, which returns a string I could use as a mapping to the arguments read by argparse.br I found an a hrefhttpparezcoydigo.wordpress.com20120804fromargparsetodictionaryinpython27 relnofollowarticle describing how to get a dict of the argparse resultsa. So the mapping  pyxb element  argparse argument value isnt a problem anymore. The iteration is the problem.  p  pAny ideasp

Negative 9622 pDoes anyone know if its possible to use and how mapviews Google Maps API v2 on two or more tabs in a tabhostp  pFollowing quite long text describes my problem with two or more maps on tabhost and my findings about this. Maybe someone knows better cleaner solution. Please help if you can. Or confirm my findings.p  pI have an application with tabhost and some tabs need to display a map. There are activities and fragments run in each tab. I need to display maps using MapView, so I call all MapViews onCreate, onResume, ... on appropriate methods of their parent activities fragments resp.. But when I switch between tabs activities only first map works. Maps on other tabs display the first tab map, until I remove the first tab map from its parent view group.p  pI built my own test app based on Google Maps API v2 demo package and I have four map demos which can be run either from a list or in tabs. When I run all test one after each other from the list, everything works as expected, as there are onCreate, onResume, onPause and onDestroy called on a mapview and some internal GMS, OpenGL or whatever resources are released and reinitialized I suppose.p  pEach activityfragment has its own mapview, so each mapview mentioned it the codes is unique for its respective activityfragment which declares it.p  precodeList   Click item     Activity.onCreate gt mapview initialized, mapview.onCreate     Activity.onResume gt mapview.onResume     map is shown and works as expcted   Click back     Activity.onSaveInstanceState gt mapview.onSaveInstanceState     Activity.onPause gt mapview.onPause     Activity.onDestroy gt mapview.onDestoy codepre  pThe list is displayed and another item can be selected and works fine.p  pBut when I run all tests in tabs, only first map works, when I switch to other tab, there is no onDestroy called on first tab activity and thus no onDestroy is called on its mapview. As I understand read further its not the problem. p  precodeTab original version, mapviews methods called from respective activityfrag methods   first tab is displayed FTab     FTabActivity.onCreate gt mapview initialized, mapview.onCreate     FTabActivity.onResume gt mapview.onResume     map is shown and works as expected   click on other tab OTab     FTabActivity.onSaveInstanceState gt mapview.onSaveInstanceState     FTabActivity.onPause gt mapview.onPause      no FTabActivity.onDestroy     OTabActivity.onCreate gt mapview initialized, mapview.onCreate     OTabActivity.onResume gt mapview.onResume      first map still visible so its not possible to control other map   click back to first tab     OTabActivity.onSaveInstanceState gt mapview.onSaveInstanceState     OTabActivity.onPause gt mapview.onPause      no OTabActivity.onDestroy     FTabActivity.onResume gt mapview.onResume     map on FTab works codepre  pI suspect that the map from the first tab is still displayed when I switch to the other tab, as when I pan the map on the first tab I see this panned map on the other tab. And thats possibly the reason why I cannon pan or zoom the map on the other tab. Or maybe I pan and zoom it but I dont see it as there is a map from the first tab displayed.p  pWhen I move mapview.onDestroy to activityfragment onPause and mapview.onCreate to activityfragment onResume I still have the same problem. I still see first tab mapview on other tabs, even the first tab mapview should be already destroyed. Possibly some bug or some OpenGL cached data displayedp  precodeTab both mapview.onCreate and mapview.onResume called from activityfragment onResume   first tab is displayed FTab     FTabActivity.onCreate gt mapview initialized     FTabActivity.onResume gt mapview.onCreate, mapview.onResume     map is shown and works as expected   click on other tab OTab     FTabActivity.onSaveInstanceState gt mapview.onSaveInstanceState     FTabActivity.onPause gt mapview.onPause, mapview.onDestroy      no FTabActivity.onDestroy     OTabActivity.onCreate gt mapview initialized     OTabActivity.onResume gt mapview.onCreate, mapview.onResume      first map still visible so its not possible to control other map   click back to first tab     OTabActivity.onSaveInstanceState gt mapview.onSaveInstanceState     OTabActivity.onPause gt mapview.onPause, mapview.onDestroy      no OTabActivity.onDestroy     FTabActivity.onResume gt mapview.onCreate, mapview.onResume     map on FTab works codepre  pThe only solution I found to work but I dont like it too much is to remove mapview from its parent ViewGroup setting mapview visibility to GONE doesnt help. Then its possible to put mapview onCreate and onDestroy back to respective activityfragment onCreate and onDestroy. Then the first tab mapview disappears and I see other tab mapview and I can control the map.p  precodeTab mapviews methods called from respective activityfrag methods   first tab is displayed FTab     FTabActivity.onCreate gt mapview initialized, mapview.onCreate, remove mapview from parent view group     FTabActivity.onResume gt mapview.onResume, add mapview to parent view group     map is shown and works as expected   click on other tab OTab     FTabActivity.onSaveInstanceState gt mapview.onSaveInstanceState     FTabActivity.onPause gt mapview.onPause, remove mapview from parent view group      no FTabActivity.onDestroy     OTabActivity.onCreate gt mapview initialized, mapview.onCreate, remove mapview from parent view group     OTabActivity.onResume gt mapview.onResume, add mapview to parent view group     map on OTab works   click back to first tab     OTabActivity.onSaveInstanceState gt mapview.onSaveInstanceState     OTabActivity.onPause gt mapview.onPause, remove mapview from parent view group      no OTabActivity.onDestroy     FTabActivity.onResume gt mapview.onResume, add mapview to parent view group     map on FTab works codepre  pRegards, Martinp

Every time the macro reads 2 values on the same row in the original table, it should copy them in columns A and B in the worksheet and continue the process by writing another pair of numbers in the subsequent row. If I writep  pcodeSheet.RangeA1B1.Insert ShiftxlDownbr  Sheet.Cells1, 1  number 1 br Sheet.Cells1, 2  number 2codep  pall I get in the end is the last pair of values from the original table.

Negative 9622 pIm writing a cart function for a webpage project I have. On the cart page, it checks your cart ID in a cookie, and then gets all of your items in the database. So, every item in the Cart table is dynamically created. On the .aspx page, there is an empty table created. In the codebehind, a new row and cells are created for each item.p  pIm having trouble with updating the Quantity of a certain item. For each item in the cart, a textbox and button are dynamically created for the quantity, and updating the quantity. The quantity is set to whatever the quantity is in the database on page load. I cant seem to get the value of the textbox after it has been changed, for example from 1 to 2. p  pHeres a summary of how the table is populated. Ive shortened it a lot, just to show how im loading the data into the table. p  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e     cartpopulatecartID   private void cartpopulateint cartID     for each item in database where cartID is paramater cartID     create a row      get the product name, image, price, quantity, options, and make a cell for each     calculate total price from quantity and price     add in delete and quantity update buttons codepre  pFor ease, lets just assume all the quantites are 1. So, on pageload, it will set all of the quantities to 1. I think my problem is that the following code sets the value of the textbox to whatever the quantity is when its populated, which would be 1. When you change it to 2 or whatever, the value is already set and the 2 does nothing. The database updating part works, Im just having trouble getting the second value 2.p  pHeres the quantity update code...p  precode            if prod.Quantity  null  quantitylabel.Value  1.ToString              else  quantitylabel.Value  prod.Quantity.ToString               quantityinput.ID  quantity  i.ToString             quantityinput.Width  20             quantityinput.Text  quantitylabel.Value.ToString             quantitycell.Controls.Addquantityinput             quantitycell.CssClasscartitem             row.Cells.Addquantitycell              Button btnUpdate  new Button             btnUpdate.Text  Update             string arg  quantityinput.Text             btnUpdate.CommandName  update             btnUpdate.CommandArgument  arg             btnUpdate.Command  s, e gt                                      string quanupdate  Convert.ToStringe.CommandArgument                     int quanint  Convert.ToInt32quanupdate                     prod.Quantity  quanint                     db.SubmitChanges                     Response.Redirectcart.aspx                  codepre  pIve looked at a few different solutions, but none of them seem to work.

FYI, gw is there so I can find my changes quickly.p  pThe HTML code is describing a horizontal slice of my webpage. On the left is what Bootstrap calls a herounit think of it as a formatted text box, and on the right is a 250x250pixel photo.p  pFor those of you who do not know what responsive means, it means that as the width of the webpage narrows, the various elements of the page resize and rearrange themselves so that the resulting page always looks good. This way, the same webpage will look acceptable on a computer, a tablet, and a smart phone.p  pHeres the desired effect I want within the range of webpage sizes most appropriate to a desk computer As the width of the webpage decreases, the height of the hero unit increases. As this is happening, the image moves down so that it is vertically centered with respect to the height of the hero unit.p  pHeres what actually happens For a while, the images vertical positioning remains unchanged. Then at some point, the image starts shrinking and at the same time starts drifting up toward the imaginary horizontal line that runs through the top boundary of the hero unit i.e., the beginning of the area being defined by this code.p  pHeres an observation that seems to be closely related to the problem When I use Firebug to highlight the area covered by a given HTML tag, I find that the height of the span7 area the hero unit and the height of the span5 area are different. I assumed that Bootstrap would make them all the same heightafter all, a rowfluid codedivcode seems to represent a rectangular slice of the webpage. Also, as the webpage is narrowed, the area of the span5 element shrinks to exactly cover the codeimgcode as it shrinks.p  pMaybe nothing can be done Ive seen some webpages that say that centering an element vertically is just not something that HTML does. But even some insight on why Bootstrap is behaving the way Im describing could help me modify the current behavior in a way that makes the result less godawful.p

Negative 9622 pOk, Im building a PoC for an ASP.NET MVC 4 mobile application that needs to have offline capabilities, and I have several questions about whether Im designing the application correctly and also what behavior I will get from the cache manifest.p  pIm progressing with the PoC but Im observing a weird behavior on a working controller action right after adding the manifest attribute to my Layout.cshtml.p  pBefore adding the attribute, every time I requested that URL, a breakpoint I had on the controller action would be hit just once every time. After adding it, the breakpoint is being hit 3 times the first time the page is requested first time ever, and it is no longer hit at all until I manually delete the local cached manifest.p  pNothing else changed, so this makes me believe that this type of offline caching works differently that the regular way in which browsers cache works. Im thinking that since the page Im visiting is listed on the manifest, the breakpoint is hit the first time because I requested the page, and then a second time because it is listed on the manifest.p  pThat is weird already. Why is thatp  pBesides that, why is it being hit a third timep  pIve verified that the behavior goes away if I manually delete the locally cached manifest and also remove the manifest attribute from the html tag, so this is most likely the culprit.p  pCan anyone explain whats going on please Thanks.p

Right  Needless to say that it is more dangerous for a CachingConnectionFactory which inherits this method from SingleConnectionFactory. p  pstrongExtended versionstrong Can we say one should NOT use the setClientId on a SingleCachingConnectionFactory  This is made even more imperative by the following statement in DefaultMessageListenerContainers setClientId p  blockquote   pFurthermore, a client ID can only be assigned if the original   ConnectionFactory hasnt already assigned onep blockquote  pSo, if someone accidentally setClientId on the CachingConnectionFactory, future sets of the client id on the DefaultMessageListenerContainer would be noops p

Negative 9622 pIn my Java SEJava EE application I have a DAO interface to wrap around entity manager to allow simple CRUD operations. I also have an extended DAO interface that allows the simple CRUD operations to be performed as a batch operation, meaning all operations will be done under the same transaction. This allows me to roll back if one of the sequential CRUD operation fails.p  precodepublic interface DomEntityManager     void createEntityObject aEntity throws TransactionException    void deleteEntityObject aEntity throws TransactionException    void updateEntityObject aEntity throws TransactionException    ltTgt T findByIdint aId, ClassltTgt aClass    ltTgt T getNewEntityClassltTgt aClass throws TransactionException   public interface BatchDomEntityManager extends DomEntityManager     void executeBatchTransation transaction   public interface BatchTransaction     public void run  codepre  pIn this above design, what I am trying to achieve is, if the client calling code calls any of the DomEntityManager operations within the execute BatchTransaction method, then I want the operations to use a single transaction.p  pCurrently, the Dom entity manager implementation has the straight forward implementation, where for each request an entity manager is created and new transaction is started and committed at the end of the request inside the DAO method. I am little stuck as how can I implement the share entity manager case. Should I be using ThreadLocal, in which case should the execute transaction block be executed in a separate thread. Its ok for me to block the execute call until the transaction is completed.p  pThanks for any suggestion.p

Negative 9622 pI thought about taking data directly from the HTML forms, through javascript, or through the code behind of the page, but am not sure how to do any of these or which one is the most secure, scalable, and efficient although I would presume using ASP.netC is the best option.

How do I create these variables on the ASP.net based web page, and feed them to the query  For example, I honestly dont know where to place in what code file or where in that query.  Also, I dont understand where the query will pull those variables from.p  pMy first thought was that the var refer to the variables I will create on my page using C Razor.  This is only because I have seen that type of syntax before refer to Razor variables made on the page.  Obviously I could accomplish this also with the C code behind as well.  p

Negative 9622 pIve been trying to solve the following problem all sorts of ways today.  Ive spent hours on it and I cant seem to figure out how to do it.p  pThe basic problem is this  I have a bunch of JavaScript logic going on to figure out if the following variables should be a 1 or 0.p  precode1active 2alternative 3classic 4vintage etc....  codepre  pand all these variables act essentially as filters in my design.  I need them to determine whether a product should be displayed or not.  So once these values are determined, I want to display product styles accordingly or hide product styles by appending or removing a CSS class lets call it code.stylecode .  Each product has 1 or multiple of the filters attached to it.  So like a pair of shoes might be classic AND alternative, in which case a 1 in either classic OR alternative variables should cause the shoes to display with the style.p  pWhats the best way to do this display aspect  I was thinking of writing a custom selector but Im having a very hard time figuring out how to write it.p  pSomething like... p  precodeif.divProducts.hasClassactive  .divProducts.hasClassalternative  etc..   ....  codepre  pbut I dont get very far this way because first of all, even if the IF statement clause parses correctly, I wont know which product actually returned a 1 in alternative or active or any of the other filters.  p  pThis is really hard to explain.p  pstrongTLDR Basically I need thisstrongp  pIf ANY of the elements in some div container have ANY of the filters that are of value 1, apply code.stylecode to each of those elements.p  pHelp would be hugely appreciated as this is part of a project due tomorrow actually... I didnt expect to have such a hard time with it p  pBy the way, the products keep track of filters with classes.  So for example shoes product   p  precodeltdiv classblah blah vintageFilter blah blahgt...ltdivgt codepre  pI want to apply code.stylecode class to this div IF vintage variable is 1.  Make sensep

Negative 9622 pI have an existing C project and I want to use XCode as my IDE. Just to be clear, I have no intentions of building this on Mac OS X since its an embedded linux codebase. I really just want an IDE for editing, searching, Jump To Definition, etc. etc. Im trying to determine if Xcode will work for me.p  pAs an example, Ive created a commandline project in Xcode C since there are mixes of C and C, and added my source tree to the project.p  pMy source tree is such that it appears similar to the following. Please note that my build directory is outside my src directory. src does contain Makefile.in files.p  precodesrc  include        file01.h  file01.c  AnotherDirectory        file02.h        file02.c codepre  pIn XCode 3 the indexing will find definitions in file02.h, but not in file01.h. In XCode 4 the indexing will not find definitions of anything defined in file01.h or file02.h.p  pIs there a way to add folders or files to the indexingp  pIn both version Ive added the src folder and linked instead of copied. p  pIs there a way to get XCode 3 or 4 to be able to Jump To Definition with my source treep  pRegards, slowrunnerp  pEdit Explicitly adding the directory include did not fix the issue.p  pEdit02 If I copy as necessary and create folders for groups, it finds everything. However, if I only add references and dont copy the source over into the project workspace folder, it wont find any of those definitions. This seems to point to a referencing issue. p
Negative 9622 pI have a static library that i can build in both Debug and NonDebug mode. I wish to use the Debug version in an RTP when i build the RTP with the Debug Mode option.

I am looking for how to setup the project file to automatically select the appropriate path based on having Debug Mode checked or not. Thanksp

Negative 9622 pI am somewhat new to python. I have been trying to find the answer to this coding question for some time. I have a function set up to run on a threading timer. This allows it to execute every second while my other code is running.

The reason for this is that due to a changing delay in a stepper motor the function takes different amounts of time run.p

Negative 9622 pI have looked at different ways of doing this using diff.  The first option I tried isp  precodep4 diff sa codepre  blockquote   pOpened files that are different from the revision in the depot, or missing.p blockquote  pInitially I figured that this was a file with write permission bit set that did not exist in the depot.  However, I have since learned p4 doesnt use mode bits to track openedunopened states as I first thought.p  pNext I figured this option would workp  precodep4 diff sl codepre  blockquote   pEvery unopened file, along with the status of same, diff or missin as compared to its revision in the depot.p blockquote  pThis would be okay, except unopened is not inclusive of untracked files.  Although, when I ran this, it produced something quite different that contradicts the documentation it output pretty much everything that was tracked, but also output everything that wasnt tracked, but flagged them as same.  Maybe this means that it hasnt been added and doesnt exist in the depot, so the client is the same as the depot...  In my SVN biased opinion, a rather pointless option.p  pThen there is the opened option.  But this does exactly that.  It lists all the files in the depot that have been opened on the client so not the files modified on the client not yet added.p  pSo is there an option I am missing somewhere, that will provide some valuable answer, like SVN and CVS are able to do with one simple commandp  precode svn status A added M modified R deleted  untracked L locked C conflict codepre  pOrp  precode cvs q up Pd codepre

Anyone have any ideas I would rather not get ride of that design element but if I have to I will or should I use jQueryp  pstrongCSSstrongp  precodetopmenu    width 100   height 50px   background mediumSeaGreen   topmenu gt ul    liststyletype none   padding 0   margin 0 auto   width 70   clear both     topmenu gt ul gt li    float left   width 11.1   background 2b2b2b   display block   height 50px   lineheight 50px   textalign center   color fff   webkittransition all .5s ease   cursor pointer   topmenu gt ul gt lihover    background mediumSeaGreen   topmenu gt ul gt li gt ul    display none   liststyletype none   margin 0   padding 5px   background mediumSeaGreen   position relative   top 10px   borderradius 3px   boxshadow 0 1px 2px 2b2b2b   topmenu ul li ulbefore    content    position absolute   borderright 10px solid transparent   borderleft 10px solid transparent   borderbottom 10px solid mediumSeaGreen   top 10px   left 42   display block   zindex 1002   topmenu gt ul gt lihover gt ul    display block   topmenu gt ul gt li gt ul gt li    padding 0   margin 5px 0 5px 0   lineheight 18px   color 2b2b2b  codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJoshPowell48NrT relnofollowjsFiddleap

Negative 9622 pI have a typical use case in my current project. I want my client to be able to edit only pictures in the WordPress site I am building for them. They should not be able to edit any text whatsoever, anywhere on the site.p  pI thought of two different paths to take  1. Use jQuery to edit the images from the front end, but I dont know how I will save the changes to database given that the entire post content is in one place on the WordPress DB. 2. Disable text editing in the TinyMCE for that particular role, so the user can only open up posts in the TinyMCE and can change only the images using the Add Media button.p  pWhich path would you take among these two And if there is another better solution, please guide me to it.p

move at a very high speed, and if you look through the code, you see I call coderepaintcode in the codepaintcode method in which I override. I know thats not good to do. But my question is, is their any other way in which I could draw each cell outside of the coderepaintcode loop I have right now, because that causes other components to flashflicker when I use this in a JFrame with other components.p  pFYI Aventually Id like to achieve something similar to this a hrefhttpactiveden.netitembackgroundanimationblurrylightcells21980WT.accategoryitemampWT.seg1categoryitemampWT.zauthorranfirefly relnofollow titleClick MeClick Hereap  pThanksp

Negative 9622 pSuppose you have a very large graph with lots of processing upon its nodes like tens of milions of operations per node. The core routine is the same for each node, but there are some additional operations based on internal conditions. There can be 2 such conditions which produces 4 cases 0,0, 1,0, 0,1, 1,1. E.g. 1,1 means that both conditions hold. Conditions are established once one set for each node independently in a program and, from then on, never change. Unfortunately, they are determined in runtime and in a fully unpredictable way based on data received via HTTP from and external server.p  pWhat is the fastest in such scenario taken into account modern compiler optimizations which I have no idea ofp  ul lisimply using IFs if condition X perform additional operation X.li liusing inheritance to derive four classes from base class exposing method OPERATION to have a proper operation and save tens milions of ifs.

Negative 9622 pA few days ago Ive started to develop a MFC Application which works as a Client for a database of mine. Lately, I was trying to implement a method which is executed every time a property value is changed preferably a field which works as a combobox on the Properties Window. My first attempt was to override the codeCMFCPropertyGridPropertyOnUpdateValuecode. I was able to implement this method properly, but it didnt worked as expected I believe that the main problem here is that I did not implemented it directly on the CProperties class, but I couldnt find any other references in the internet.p  pSo, Ive moved on to commands based on message maps. Ive tried many kinds of commands, like codeONCONTROLREFLECTcode, codeCBNEDITCHANGEcode, codeCBNEDITUPDATEcode, but none of these seemed to help. Im not sure if Ive done a huge mistake on defining the main properties first argument from these previos commands or if they are exclusive commands for the codeCComboboxcode class. In other words, these commands seemed to be useless to my current Property Grid since the only combobox Ive used until now is that one which is generated when the method CMFCPropertyGridPropertyAddOption is used Important note my whole Property Grid is basically formed by CMFCPropertyGridProperty objects.p  pAnyway, I believe that the answers for my doubts and the solution for this problem are kind of simple, but I am still a newbie in C and MFC...p

Negative 9622 pI have an odd problem which I am trying to make solve now for a while. I have made a web app that gets data for a graph which is rendered using Highcharts. p  pThe script fetches data from the DB, saves it into a file and renders the graph using .getJson method in jquery which goes to another ajax file and processes the data that was saved. The user can spend x amount of time browsing the graph, and everytime the user changes the zoom level, an ajax request is sent back to my ajax page which again uses the saved data file to send graph data back. p  pThe problem now is that if another user uses the app whilst the original user is still using the graph and its constantly being updated by the ajax file, the saved data file is overwritten and the original user will have the wrong graph data sent back to them.p  pI considered using SESSION however the data can be very large at times.

Negative 9622 pWith iOS 7 a new push animation was created, which slides the pushed view controller on top of the hierarchy. But when the animation happens, iOS apparently does two things to modify the design of the top view controllerp  pA shadow is addedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7Mhro.png altA shadow of view controller when animatingp  pAnd a light overlay over the bottom view controllerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commq1Pa.png altA light overlayp  pIn most applications this is not a problem. But, I am currently working on an application with pixel perfect design and I use view controllers with clear background. But this functionality remains the same, and the light overlay appears over the view controller. Because the background is a white gradient, this light overlay on screenshot 2 is very visible and when the animation completes, it is removed without animation, which makes it very noticeable and annoying.p  pI am aware I can create custom animations and transitions, but I am wonderingp  pstrongIs there any way to remove or modify this light overlay and shadow, without having to create custom transitionsstrongp  pThank you for your help.p

Negative 9622 pNow I have some code that I would like to parallelize. The easiest thing would be to use openmp which will take advantage of the multiple processors and their cores and their shared memory. I have access to a network that I use for number crunching. I dont know if the memory on it is shared or distributed. How can I find this out If it is shared then I can easily use openmp and it will work. I do less proccpuinfo and I see that I have 8 processors available on the network. and I do lessprocmeminfo and it tells me I have  32000mega bytes of memory.p

Negative 9622 pOur requirement is to strongcodeupload objects in Amazon S3 using a browser based interfacecodestrong. For this were utilizing codeQuery String Authenticationcode mechanism we dont have endusers credentials during the upload process and were using ASP.Net to write code to do so. Im running into issues when trying to do multipart uploads. p  pIm using AWS .Net SDK version 2.0.2.5 to create a query string using the following code belowp  precode            GetPreSignedUrlRequest request  new GetPreSignedUrlRequest                              BucketName  bucketName,                 Key  objectKey,                 Expires  expiryTime,                 Protocol  Amazon.S3.Protocol.HTTP,                 Verb  Amazon.S3.HttpVerb.PUT,                 ContentType  applicationoctetstream,               var url  AWSClientFactory.CreateAmazonS3Clientcredentials, region.GetPreSignedURLrequest codepre  pThis works great if I dont do multipart upload. However Im not able to figure out how to do a multipart upload using Query String.p  pProblems that Im running into arep  ol liIn order to do a multipart upload, I need to get an codeUploadIdcode first. However the method to get codeUploadIdcode is a codePOSTcode HTTP Request and codeGetPreSignedUrlRequestcode method does not take codePOSTcode as an HTTP verb.li liI finally ended up putting a bucket policy where I granted my Amazon S3 account permission on the bucket in question which does not belong to me and using that account I am doing HTTP POST to get codeUploadIdcode.li liNow based on my understanding, the query string must contain codeUploadIdcode and codePartNumbercode parameters when creating the query string authentication URL but looking at codeGetPreSignedUrlRequestcode object properties, I cant figure out how to specify these parameters there.li ol  pI am inclined to believe that .Net SDK does not support this scenario and I have to resort to native REST API to create query string. Is my understanding correctp  pAny insights into this would be highly appreciated.p  pHappy New Year in advance.p
Negative 9622 pIm having some really weird behavior in my UIViewController. Im connecting two devices via the Multipeer Framework and once a iPhone starts sending data I want the other iPhone to display a UIViewController which handles the received data. So once iPhone A starts sending, iPhone B posts a NSNotification. The notification is arriving pretty fast and the code below is being executedp  precode voidpresentPeerViewNSNotification notif      UIStoryboard storyboard  [UIStoryboard storyboardWithNameMain bundlenil]     ClientViewController clientView  ClientViewController [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierpeerView]     [clientView setImageimage]     clientView.modalTransitionStyle  UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal     [self.window.rootViewController presentViewControllerclientView animatedYES completionnil]  codepre  pNow here comes the weird part. First of all, the ClientViewController gets displayed. But there is no animation, it just appears out of nowhere. My viewDidLoad gets called and runs following codep  precode voidviewDidLoad      [self.view setBackgroundColor[UIColor colorWithPatternImage[self blurImageimage]     [self.imageView setImageimage]          codepre  pNow, I see the blurred image, which is fine. But the non blurred image dosent displays in the UIImageView. I mean the image gets passed properly, otherwise I couldnt see the blurred Background. I also have a few Interface elements from the Storyboardp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4lGCa.png altScreenshot from Storyboardp  pSo the UIViewController loads with the blurred background Imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIz03D.png altblurred Background examplep  pAs you can see, none of the Storyboard UI Elements are loaded, except for the UISwitch which looks quite strange, too. After a couple of seconds it depends, sometimes up to 30, sometimes only 3 seconds the whole UI loads up img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJrCi6.png altWhole UI after some timep  pSo, maybe someone of you had the same issue before, I really dont understand why the UI does take so much time to load. The CPU percentage is somewhere around 3.p  pI also added a NSLog to the this completion blockp  precode[self.window.rootViewController presentViewControllerclientView animatedYES completion NSLogdone. ] codepre  pwhich is called instantly. The viewDidLoad seems to work fine, there are no lines it might get stuck, if I do a NSLog at the end of viewDidLoad it gets called instantly as well, but the view as you can see in the images below isnt loaded completely.p

Negative 9622 pI have a rails application which has a mountable engine inside it. Im currently setting up rspec tests for the mountable engine. These require access to the models and helpers from the parent application. Im aware that there is some coupling here but this is not a reusable component and the engine is being used for providing additional functionality that is otherwise separate from the parent application.p  pIm able to run these tests in the dummy application that is created from the coderails new plugincode command but this does not have access to the parent application models.p  pstrongHow can I configure my spec helper such that it will load models and configuration settings from the parent applicationstrong Ideally this would include any configuration in the parent applications codespechelper.rbcode.p  pI believe I should be able to use my parent application instead of the dummy application but have been unsuccessful so far.

Negative 9622 pI am currently refreshingaltering my knowledge in software development because I will work in this area soon. We have learned a lot about UML diagrams and coding at University, but I have never brought it all together in a real Project. Therefore, I started to create a test webapp in Grails, and I wanted to begin with a requirements analysis and use cases too keep it close to reality.p  pMy webapp should allow users to share recipes, find recipes and review recipes by other users. Every recipe has many ingredients, which are not just strings but rather entities so that calories, fat, protein and carbs can be used to automatically calculate nutrition facts of a certain recipe.p  pAn ingredient can be added to the database by either a consumer or nutrition expert. If it is created by a consumer, it is only a prospective ingredient, meaning that it has to be verified by an administrator to become a proper ingredient  otherwise it is marked, e.g. red text color.p  pThis is my current use case diagramp  pa hrefhttpubuntuone.com0zDw9kEbj1BwtXjnCtxdwC relnofollowhttpubuntuone.com0zDw9kEbj1BwtXjnCtxdwCap  pMy question here isp  ul liAs far as Im concerned, included use cases can be reused, meaning included by other use cases or associated with other actors as well.

Negative 9622 pIn one application I have developed I am storing data in custom objects I call these files. These objects have quite a few properties.br The files are sorted into groups. I display certain properties of the files in a ListView control with Groups enabled.br I am storing the files in a codeDictionaryOf String, ListOf MyFilecode, where codeStringcode is the group name.br The user is able to move files form one group to another, sort groups, move files in a group up and down, add and delete files and so on.br Currently I am doing this all by hand. I manually add the files to the group and synchronize the listview and the stored files whenever the user changes anything. This gets very messy, very quickly and I dont like my approach. It works currently but it is a nightmare to change and maintain.p  pI know only little about data binding. I have tried it a some times but I found it equally clumsy.

So, if I have my window height set at 400 and the next element is wider than whats being rendered, it wont account for its width.  Instead, itll use the width of the widest rendered item.  If I set my height to say... 410, itll take the width of that next element into consideration.  However, with several hundred items, I cant be using height for that purpose.  Is there a way to set that columns width as the widest element in it, regardless if its in the initial renderp  pNote that I dont want to use codeScrollViewer.CanContentScrollFalsecode solution from a related SO question.  That would have a huge performance consequence with a very large list.p

Negative 9622 pWhat is the correct way to get a service, hopefully using Declarative Service if possible, when you dont know the attributes of the service to request until after runtime p  pThe use case is analogous to having 3 bundles providing services version 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 but not knowing which one will be consumed until the user chooses one in the UI. If the user chooses 2.0 the consumer will consume the stuff from bundle 2.0p  pWe are using BND annotations, so something with them would be ideal, but i have a feeling that we need to use the OSGi API directly instead of using annotations or declarative services injection.p  pFinally, if it is relevant, this is more to get different versions of a resource XML schema rather than about different behaviourimplementations. The idea was that the service would be providing its internal resource, which would be different in each version, even though the code in the service itself would be the samep
Negative 9622 pI am building up a baseline JHipster project with no bells and whistles involved no clustering, etc..  I am following the exact tutorial steps using my standard Nodeenabled of course command line, and am then importing the project into Eclipse as a Maven Project. Everything looks like it should be working fine based on reviewing the project, except when I try to run it on the server or build it using the mvn command line... p  h2Error Messageh2  precodeINFO Starting Servlet Engine Apache Tomcat7.0.12 Exception in thread main  Exception java.lang.OutOfMemoryError thrown from the UncaughtExceptionHandler in thread main codepre  h2POMMavenh2  pFrom what I can tell, this may be a POM dependency error, but if so then I am having a heck of a time figuring out which. My project is directly configured to use JRE 1.7. My POM is below. Another thought is that it is directly related to the original NPM install from Hipster after POMp  precodeltparentgt     ltgroupIdgtorg.springframework.bootltgroupIdgt

A palette of gray shades is created. And each frame selects a different one of those gray shades. So the desired video transitions from white to black. This happens as expected on Win7 and earlier. But on Win8 the video just contains the first white frame.p  pIt seems to be an issue with the .avi file generation. If I generate a file on Win8 and view on Win7 then the file does not play correctly. If I generate the file on Win7 and view on Win8 then the video displays as desired.p  pI know that Video for Windows is an ancient legacy API. However, the frames that I am encoding are very amenable to runlength encoding. And the MRLE codec is available by default on all versions of Windows that I support. So there are good reasons why I am reluctant to try to use one of the more modern multimedia APIs until I can be sure that Video for Windows on Win8 with MRLE is a lost cause.p  h2The Questionh2  pIs it possible to use Video for Windows on Win8 to create MRLE encoded .avi files If so how is it donep

Negative 9622 pIm having an issue where I run my jasmine unit tests in Karma, and one of my unit tests that depends on an external template AngularJS directive doesnt pass.

We have a templateService we created where it retrieves the correct template based on the templateUrl of a directive which looks like thisp  precodetemplateUrl navigationtemplate codepre  pSo Ive set up Karma to pull the templates and store them in the templateCache. Then I extract the templates with the key Karma used the file path and reinsert them into the templateCache with the templateUrl the directive is expecting. Heres how I do itp  precodevar template  ltdivgt  templateCache.gettemplateFilePath  ltdivgt   template files contain multiple templates so this filters out the one I want template  [TemplateId  directiveTemplateUrl  ], template.html templateCache.putdirectiveTemplateUrl, template codepre  pFor all of the other tests, this works fine, but one in particular is producing the error above. Whats more interesting is that if I add console logs like thisp  precodevar template  ltdivgt  templateCache.gettemplateFilePath  ltdivgt if template.indexOfundefined gt 1  throw new ErrorTemplate not in cache.  template  [TemplateId  directiveTemplateUrl  ], template.html if template  throw new ErrorTemplate not found.  templateCache.putdirectiveTemplateUrl, template codepre  pIt logs out that the template wasnt found. p  precodeError Template not in cache.,Error Unexpected request GET navigationtemplate No more request expected codepre  pIf I DEBUG in the browser the DEBUG button when Karma loads the browser, I can confirm the template is there and in the browser console not the command line where Karma is running, but the F12 developer tools in the browser it logs out that the test was successful like thisp  precodeLOG SUCCESS ButtonsDirectives NavigationDirective Should render a loading message  codepre  pHeres what I knowp  pThere are no significant differences between the failing unit test and the passing ones. It is unrelated to the order in which the unit tests run this one just happens to run first.p

Negative 9622 pWe have Internet Explorer set to with its default Display intranet sites in Compatibility View turned on, but we want one of our intranet applications to be a fullblooded HTML5 application  so weve set the codeXUACompatiblecode header to codeIEedgecode and the F12 Developer Tools confirm that for this one intranet site, the compatibility mode is codeEdgecode.p  pAll looks well except for one particular feature.

Negative 9622 pThere are some excellent biginteger.js libraries out there. Currently I am using a hrefhttpscode.google.compcrypticosourcebrowsetrunkjsbn.jsr2 relnofollowjsbin.js by Tom Wua to exchange matching SRP proofofpassword hashes between a browse and java on the server. p  pMy problem is that I cannot seem to easily convert a byte array representing a large signed integer into a Javascript BigInteger which matches the Java code below. This is required to be able to hash at the browser in a way which matches two codeRFC 5054code compliant java cryto libraries bounceycastle and nimbusds. The two java libraries which do codeHA,Bcode hashing of the SRP protocol as p  precodebyte[] output  digest.digest  sha256 digest gives byte array return new BigInteger1, output  1 indicates positive number codepre  pThat does not work with the bsbin.js library as it does not have a constructor which takes a signed byte array. Javascript doesnt have signed bytes. Whats the easy way to do the same codeHABcode conversion to signed data in javascript in a way which works with the two published libraries which use the byte array constructor of codejava.math.BigIntegercode p  pSomething like the following would work to convert the signed byte array into a large decimal string  p  precodevar output  moduleSHA256.hashToBinaryArraymessage  sha256 digest gives byte array var signedNumberString  someConversionoutput   return new BigIntegersignedNumberString  this value toString16 must match Java code codepre  pI am also willing to try a different javascript BigInteger library which has all the math logic of the bsbin.js library but which has a signed byte array style constructor. p  pN.B. a hrefhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc2945.txt relnofollowRFC2945a points out that converting a sequence of bytes into a big number is one key implementation issue worth specifying for interoperable SRP negotiation and specifies  p  blockquote   pAn nbyte string S can be converted to an integer as follows p      pi  S[n1]  256  S[n2]  2562  S[n3]  ...  256n1  S[0]p blockquote  pThe problem as stated above is that the Java code uses the byte array constructor of BigInteger which is not platform portable rather than the documented conversion given in RFC2945. p  pstrongEditstrong Please note I have successfully edited the opensource  Java cryptography libraries in question to do codeHABcode hashing as trivial string concat and got everything all working fine exchanging SRP password proofs with a browser. Yet I dont want to use nor publish my own edited versions of java cryptography libraries. I want to write javascript which is compatible with original and unedited java SRP crypto logic. p  pstrongEditstrong Please note one fix is the change the java to hex encode the byte array returned by the hash then use the constructor codenew BigIntegerhexstring,16code which is more platform portable. That would give an entirely different number to the number given from codenew BigIntegerhashbytescode but is repeatable in Javascript and works when I tried that. Once again I dont want to publish edited java crypo libraries so this is not a solution.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I actually got around this problem by using a new extension point in one of the java libraries to plug in a codehash gt hex string gt BigIntegercode approach. The problem still stands for people wanted to make Javascript run like java which uses the byte array constructor of BigInteger. p

Negative 9622 pIm using thegamesdb.com s API to get all gaming platforms and all games on each platform. At the moment, I start with a blank page, on document.ready, I do an AJAX call to the server to get all the platforms. Then I have to do another AJAX call for each platform to get a count of games on that platform ex. PC has 2342 games, XBOX has 453 games, .... The reason Im doing this call too, is to provide the user a progress bar 0100 and to show the number of the game on the total games of the platform  p  pSo after these API calls, I should have a list of all the platforms which can be clicked to start another serverside call to do an api call for each game, to get the data of it. When a platform is clicked, the client sends a new call each time so that the server puts the game data in the database. Then we do the gamecounter.p  pIve tried doing this with AJAX calls to the serverp  precode.getJSONplatformlist.dataurlgetplatforms, function data      self.platforms  .mapdata, functionp  return new Platformp      console.logself.platforms     .eachself.platforms, function           console.logthis         .getJSONplatformlist.dataurlgetplatformgames,  platformId this.id , function platformgamesdata              this.countGamesDone  0             .eachplatformgamesdata, function                  this.games.pushnew PlatformGamethis                 this.countGames                              codepre  pBut since this is async, this can not show the progress and just makes the browser load until all the games are in the database without any feedback. I could put the AJAX on asyncfalse, but Ive read that there are other ways of doing this, but no one says how to do it.p  pWhat are other options of doing this I have no restrictions on what technologies to use. Its an ASP.NET MVC 5 application. I can use javascript, c, signalr, jquery and any other javascript library if this can simplify this.p

But how does Task Manager get it Is it calculated from more than one counterp  pBTW, How to tell the difference between low impact background disk operations run Windows Defender full scan to observe this from high impact ones during Windows startupp  pShortly after you get to the Windows desktop the computer is very unresponsive, next to useless, for a couple of minutes or seconds if you have fast SSD. This is related to disk time. When you wait until disk time drops below 50  system is perfectly responsive.p  pHowever its not the case when disk time over 90 is caused by Windows Defender or other background tasks. It doesnt affect system responsiveness. Hibernate and restore system. Youll notice disk time over 90 for at least a minute up to 5 minutes on mine. But there is no problem with system responsiveness. Visual Studio starts almost immediately. There are no lags on opening big projects.p  pI figured out that shortly after reboot Average response time is huge compared to values measured while AV scan. This could be exactly it  a way to measure REAL system responsiveness. But how do they get it How to get it in .NET appp

Negative 9622 pWe are working on an ASP.NET 4.0 Web Forms application hosted on IIS. The problem is that from Site A the website is relatively fast, however, from Site B which is on a different domain the website is very slow. The main suspect is most probably the web services. p  pI am not the person who setup the network, I am just a web developer on this application. I need to help the network guys identify the issue. What is your recommendation to debug this issue and identify where exactly the delay is coming from Solutions which came to mind are SoapUI, Profiling within IIS, dotTrace, etc. If there is a delay with the web service, I want a way to prove to the network guys that it is a network issue. p  pAlso, it would be ideal that we can measure the time it takes when running multiple service calls so that we can compare it between different sites. p  pThe web application is hosted on IIS 7.5 and WCF is being used for Web Services. p

Negative 9622 pIm having a strange problem detecting GPIO events on the Raspberry Pi using Python with Tkinter. p  pOnce the codestartGameButtoncode is clicked, which calls the codestartgamecode function, a GPIO event is added in the codetrycode block, and a while loop runs for 30 seconds. During this time, I am expecting the GPIO event, codeGPIO.Fallingcode on pin 23 to occur and each time that the event occurs, the codep2ScoreEventcode function should execute. What actually happens is the event seems to only fire the first time that it occurs, if I keep causing the codeGPIO.Fallingcode event to occur nothing will happen until the while loop completes. Once the loop completes, if the event occured more than once it calls the codep2ScoreEventcode a second time, but thats it.p  pOnce Im out of that while loop in codestartgamecode the event detection works perfectly. Ive also verified that this partp  precode                try                 GPIO.addeventdetectP1PIN, GPIO.FALLING, callbackself.p2ScoreEvent                 while time.time  starttime lt gametime                     print listening                     time.sleep5             except                     print Something went wrong...

Negative 9622 pI noticed that codeMarshal.GetLastWin32Errorcode was returning error 122 during the dispose method after a pinvoke to codeKernal32.CloseHandleIntPtr phandlecode even with the import attribute codeSetLastErrorcode set to true on the import definition.  I tracked the cause down to the creation of codenew WindowsIdentitycode just before the handle being closed and Im wondering what the proper way to handle this is.p  ol liShould I only check for a Win32 error if CloseHandle returns falseli liForcefully SetLastError to 0 before pinvoking CloseHandleli liForcefully SetLastError to 0 after codenew WindowsIdentityDangereousHandlecodeli ol  pPoint 3 seems immediately unreasonable to me, so I presume thats an obvious no.p  pPoint 2 seems most reasonable, but perhaps unnecessarily aggressive. The only reason I would go with this instead of point 1 is because Im not sure I have a guarantee that if CloseHandle returns false the error code will be relevant. Is that guaranteed by the function documentationp  pPoint 1 seems like its what I should be doing. That is I should only be calling GetLastWin32Error when CloseHandle explicitly returns false and assume that the returned code will indicate why CloseHandle failed and not some prior unrelated Win API call.p  pstrongCodestrongp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeusing System using System.Runtime.ConstrainedExecution using System.Runtime.InteropServices using System.Security  namespace Common.InterOp       CloseHandle httpmsdn.microsoft.comencalibrarywindowsdesktopms72421128vvs.8529.aspx      internal static partial class Kernel32              [DllImportkernel32.dll, CharSet  CharSet.Auto, SetLastError  true]         [ReliabilityContractConsistency.WillNotCorruptState, Cer.Success]         [SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity]         [return MarshalAsUnmanagedType.Bool]         internal static extern bool CloseHandleIntPtr handle       codepre  pHeres where Close Handle is calledp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeusing Common.InterOp using Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles using System.ComponentModel using System.Runtime.InteropServices  namespace Common.InterOp       httpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.security.principal.windowsimpersonationcontext28vvs.10029.aspx      public sealed class SafeTokenHandle  SafeHandleZeroOrMinusOneIsInvalid              private SafeTokenHandle              basetrue                    protected override bool ReleaseHandle                      int Win32Error                  Marshal.GetLastWin32Error  lt Already has code 122              var Closed                  Kernel32.CloseHandlehandle  lt has SetLastErrortrue attribute              Win32Error                  Marshal.GetLastWin32Error  lt Still has code 122              if Closed ampamp Win32Error  0  This works, but is it correct                 throw                     new Win32ExceptionWin32Error              return Closed                codepre  pHeres the code block that actually generates error 122 on the line that has codevar WinID  new WindowsIdentityDangerousHandlecodep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeusing System using System.ComponentModel using System.Runtime.InteropServices using System.Security using System.Security.Principal using Common.InterOp using Common.Environment  namespace Common.Authentication      public static partial class Authentication               ltsummarygt          Authenticates the log on credentials of a Windows user.

Negative 9622 pCurrently, we have a maven project with a few thousand tests that takes two hours to run.  Weve tried running these in parallel, but since they are functional tests, each test configures the system in a specific way, which leads to race conditions and random test failures.  What Id like to do is spin up N servers on AWS, then have maven divide my tests up and run them on these servers each server would run its tests sequentially, but all servers would run in parallel, then aggregate the results.  Is there any plugin that does something like this  Ive seen something close to what I want implemented in Jenkins, but Id prefer it to be maven driven so developers can use it locally without having Jenkins installed.p

Negative 9622 pPlease consider following situation with spring 4.0.7p  pFor Eclipselink, we use a loadtimeweaver. So we wanted to experiment with Springs Configurable annotation using EnableSpringConfigured with EnableLoadTimeWeaving at the same time. p  pThis is fully functional, and SpringBeans are injected perfectly into POJOs during construction. This functionality is helpful for us, because we want to keep some code regarding validation of these POJOs inside these and not somewhere else in a Bean. p  pSOme of our Spring Context contains Beans that do not implement any interface, because they are local to some package and used only there. Lets say, FooLogicBean is one of them. If this is to be injected into another Bean, and some SpringAOPAspect notaspectj like some performance measurement aspect is in the execution path, Spring will create a CGLIB autoproxy for the FooLogicBean and inject that. This is fully functional and works perfectly too.p  pProblems arise, when we want to actually use a POJO that is annotated with Configurable as a parameter in a method of FooLogicBean like fooLogicBean.doValidatemyPojo , respectively a CGLIB Proxy. In this case, some nontrivial magic stops that POJO from being woven thru aspectj AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect from springaspects. It is even emneverem woven anywhere in the code regardless of calling the aforementioned doValidate Method. p  pIf we emcreateem that POJO inside FooLogicBean, but dont use it as a method Parameter, it gets woven again due to Configurable. p  pWithout knowing the Autoproxy creation code, we assume some fancy strongmarkingstrong routine from hindering a class from being detected by aspectj, if that class was already used in springaop. emuseem in this case means emAccessem.p  pDid anyone experiment with such obscure constellation and knows a solution for that p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 9622 pIm using expect scripts to reconfigure a bunch of Cisco routers. Mostly, its working well, I have a file of addresses that is read by a script, which passes the addresses, one at a time to another script that logs on, goes into enable mode, then pulls a series of router configuration commands from a test file, which it issues to the router. p  pThat worked well until I tried to script the logon banner. In this process, you issue the router a command line with a delimiter character, then follow that with whatever you want to have as a banner, formatted as you want to see it, then finish the banner off with a second delimiter character.p  pThat gives a problem when you move from one line to the next with CR when building the banner, each new line starts with just a blank line unlike a successful command, which will open a new line with . That means that expect has no trigger to let it know to place the next line of banner, so it hangs.p  pIve tried things with embedded n and 0x0a to no avail.p  phas anyone any suggestions has anyone succeeded in doing this beforep

Negative 9622 pIm developing a League of Legends plugin for Minecraft using the Bukkit API. Regardless of that, this question is universal.

So once the player chooses a character, that class has to be passed to the players PlayerInfo instance for sake of making this simple, I put the passed class in the constructorp  precodepublic class PlayerInfo       private Classlt extends ChampTemplategt champ      private String name      public PlayerInfoString name, Classlt extends ChampTemplategt c         this.champ  c         this.name  name           public String getName         somehow say champ.getName   and it would reference the appropriate class         return null        codepre  pNow we can finally get to my question. I have declared the variable champ as the type Class, however, whenever I want to call the abstract method of getID from the MasterYi class, that option doesnt appear in the dropdown list when I write champ.. So how can I make the variable champ be able to access all the abstract and interface methods no matter what character class I send itp  pThanks for bearing with me through this long post and thanks for any insight or advice p

In my actual program, I pass several variables implicitly all over the place, which provide the overall context in which something is happening. Scalas implicits have been wonderful for this they greatly reduce the amount of clutter in the code, yet functions deep in the call stack have access to that contextual information. The only exception is codeforcode loops I have to do this clumsy trick of defining a codevalcode that equals the enumeration variable.p  pIs there a way to pass codegenNumcode implicitly Or, if not, do you know of a reason why I should be glad that the codeforcode statement doesnt allow its Enumerator to be made implicit Often, if you know the rationale for a language feature, you see better how to go with the grain of the language.p  hr  pHeres a little more background, if it helps. Im writing a genetic algorithm that uses a variety of mutation operators. A mutation operator shouldnt know which generation its being called for. But Im also collecting data about how the mutations perform in different generations. The datacollection code emdoesem need to know which generation it is, plus a few other things. So, I pass the variables that pertain to mutation explicitly, and the variables needed for data collection implicitly.p

And so on   Toy example userspecified function which describes how to create the table double genEntryu32 i       return i  0  0  stdlogi  stdlog5    Generate a precomputed lookup table  FORLIST15 expands into genEntry0, genEntry1, genEntry2, ... const double lookupTable[16]       FORLIST16genEntry  codepre  pWhat is the cleanest way to do the same thing with templates It has to allow me to specify the number of elements in the array and allow me to supply some kind of user function index as the parameter. Functors, codestdfunctioncode, lambda, function pointer, etc, are probably all acceptable ways to define the element generator.p  pI will probably want to explicitinstantiate the template once into an objlib so that the table itself is only defined once ever, as a linkable symbol instead of being recompiled into each .cpp file that includes the header.p

Negative 9622 pI am currently working on a project involving a mixture of travelling salesman and shortest path. It goes as followsp  pI am given a set of 9 vertices,all with positive coordinates in 2 space, x,y, where x and y are positive real numbers. I am then asked to compute the shortest path a travelling salesman can take, and traverse through all the points. In essence, the graph is simply a collection of nodes with coordinates, and I have to arrange the edges, such that there is a connection from node 1 to node 9, that is the shortest possible one. It is assumed that I have already visited at the beginning node 1 x1,y1, and need to visit each node once and only once. I will end on node 9, specified by x9,y9.p  pI am writing the program in Java, although the professor said that the program can be written in any language.p  pI started by writing a node class, which represents each node, and has fields x,y which represent the x and y coordinates respectively. However, I am completely stumped as to how to perform the optimization.p  pI would greatly appreciate any assistance with respect to this problem.p  pThank you very much, and I am excited to become a member of this communityp

Negative 9622 pWe have an application running that makes and intensive usage of EF version 4.1. Right now an update is not scheduled, but this is not the point.p  pWe are going under a process of huge optimization as the workload over the Sql Server database is very high. I successfully succeeded after never succeeding in profiling the sent queries  we are under Sql Azure and I discovered that a lot of awful queries were sent, because of stupid usage of Includes. We removed all the avoidable Includes, by substituing them with direct queries on the sets i.e. 10 queries against 1 before and the total workload on Sql Server has dramatically reduced.p  pBut then I discovered that the global code is running slower. How may this be possible I started tracing and I discovered that even if a query was processed in less that 50ms, EF takes more than 1 second to materialize the entities. Thats awful. Its 2 order degrees more than a normal sql query through ADO.Net.p  pI tried by disabling the Entity Tracking on the set and querying the set with AsNoTracking but nothing seems changed.p  pI never had the possibility to analyze the total split time between query processing and object materialization, but I never ever thought that that was the impact. Is there any more that I can tryp  pp  pstrongUpdate 20150615  Performance Analysisstrongp  pI ran 7 different set of tests, and each test has been run 10 times. I tracked the total time to execute the .NET code using the old version 1 huge query with a lot of Includes and the new version 1 small query for each old Include.p  pI would say that the problem is, as Jeroen Vannevel said in the comment, the latency of the multiple request  response. Here are the summed results. Please consider that when I write item I mean a complex entity, composed by at least 10 different entities taken from 10 different DB tables.p  pGET of 1 item from the DBp  ul liOLD method 3.5 seconds averageli liNEW method 276 milliseconds averageli ul  pGET of 10 itemsp  ul liOLD method 3.6 seconds averageli liNEW method 340 milliseconds average 23li ul  pGET of 50 itemsp  ul liOLD method 4.0 seconds averageli liNEW method 440 milliseconds average 30li ul  pGET of 100 itemsp  ul liOLD method 4.5 seconds averageli liNEW method 595 milliseconds average 35li ul  pGET of 250 itemsp  ul liOLD method 5.7 seconds averageli liNEW method 948 milliseconds average 60li ul  pGET of 500 itemsp  ul liOLD method 5.9 seconds averageli liNEW method 1.8 seconds average almost 100li ul  pGET of 1000 itemsp  ul liOLD method 6.9 seconds averageli liNEW method 5.1 seconds average over 180li ul  pSo it seems that, while the OLD method is very slow from the very first execution, because of the heavy query, it increments slowly as I get more and more items from the DB.p  pI would say that as soon as the packet grows up, the time to transfer it to the calling machine is higher than DB time. May this really be the reasonp  pThanks Marcop

Negative 9622 pIm using variadic templates to capture static type information in Isis2, an atomic multicast library isis2.codeplex.com.  Some Isis2 events are delivered via upcall.  For example if you codep  precodeGroup gmyGroup g.Handlers[UDPATE]  []stringamp name, Fooamp f  ... your code  .... g.OrderedSendUPDATE, John Doe, new Foo... codepre  pthen on receiving a multicast in group g carrying an update with a string and a Foo object in it, Isis2 would construct a local instance of the Foo object and then upcall to this lambda with the appropriate arguments.  p  pSo heres my puzzle.  I have the variadic code to scan the arguments to OrderedSend and can capture the static type information needed to build my messages.  I end up passing the real OrderedSend method a onedimensional array of arguments, each with its type, a pointer or safe reference to the data or object, and for an object, the address of a marshaling method. But to use a variadic template to scan the lambda, I need to look at inner argument list of the function, in the sense that the object being added to the vector of handlers is a lambda the typetraits methods will just say that it is an object of type function.  Im after the string and Foo types, from the argument list of the lambda.  But typetraits.h lacks anything for accessing the argument list, as far as I can see.p  pA GCC11 specific option is to unmangle the typeid and parse the resulting string.  But is there a variadic template feature that would let me get to the argument list of the lambda at compile timep

Negative 9622 pI have a subview in self.view, named view1. And within view1, I have an UIImageView, named circle, which is draggable. I want that when the circle is dragged from view1 to self.view, its superview should change to self.view and its center should be converted according to the self.views coordinate system, so that circles frame remains unchanged on screen when its superview changes.p  pBasically, I am mapping the circles center from one coordinate system to another.p  pI am using convertPoint toView method to map the center from view1 to self.view.   p  pstrongFor examplestrong, if in view1, circles center was intially at 30,30. And view1 is at position 10,10 in self.view. Then this line of code will change the coordinates of the center of circle to 40,40 whenever its superview is changed to self.view.p  pstrongLine of codestrong [circle.superview convertPointcircleCenter toViewself.view]p  pBut dragging the circle back into view1 is comparatively difficult. I am trying to achieve this by the same technique, but this time from self.view to view1.p  pstrongPseudocodestrong [circle.superview convertPointcircleCenter toViewview1]p  pThis is not giving me the desired results. Which I think is because here, I am trying to convert a point from a larger coordinate system, which in this case is self.view, to a smaller one view1s coordinate system.p  pAny suggestions for how can I convert the center of circle when changing the circles superview from self.view to view1.p  pThank you.p

Negative 9622 pI am using Apache 2.4.7 with modwsgi 3.4 on Ubuntu 14.04.2 x8664 and python 3.4.0.  My python app relies on apache to perform user authentication against our companys LDAP server MS Active Directory 2008.  It also passes some additional LDAP data to the python app using the OS environment.  In the apache config, I query the LDAP like sop  precode AuthLDAPURL ldapserver389DCcompany,DClokalsAMAccountName,sn,givenName,mail,memberOfsubobjectClass AuthLDAPBindDN  AuthLDAPBindPassword  AuthLDAPRemoteUserAttribute sAMAccountName AuthLDAPAuthorizePrefix AUTHENTICATE  codepre  pThis passes some user data to my WSGI script where I handle the info as followsp  precode Make sure the packages from the virtualenv are found import site site.addsitedirhomeuser.virtualenvsispotconslibpython3.4sitepackages   Patch path for app so that libispot can be found import sys sys.path.insert0, varwwwmyapp  import os from libispot.web import app as application  def applicationenviron, startresponse     os.environ[REMOTEUSER]  environ.getREMOTEUSER,      os.environ[REMOTEUSERFIRSTNAME]  environ.getAUTHENTICATEGIVENNAME,      os.environ[REMOTEUSERLASTNAME]  environ.getAUTHENTICATESN,      os.environ[REMOTEUSEREMAIL]  environ.getAUTHENTICATEMAIL,      os.environ[REMOTEUSERGROUPS]  environ.getAUTHENTICATEMEMBEROF,      return applicationenviron, startresponse codepre  pI can then access this info in my python app using codeos.environ.getcode.  BTW If you have a more elegant solution, please let me knowp  pThe problem is that some of the user names contain special characters German umlauts, e.g., codecode that are not encoded correctly.  So, for example, the name codeTllecode arrives in my python app as codeTllecode.p  pObviously, this is an encoding problem, becausep  precode echo Tlle  iconv from utf8 to latin1  codepre  pgives me the correct codeTllecode.  p  pAnother observation that might help in my apache logs I found the character codecode represented as codexc3x83xc2xbccode.p  pI told my Apache in codeetcapache2envvarscode to use codeLANGdeDE.UTF8code and python 3 is utf8 aware as well.  I cant seem to specify anything about my LDAP server.  So my question is where is the encoding getting mixed up and how do I mend itp

Negative 9622 pI am making an App which streams the Live Audio using AVPlayer single Playpause button. Application is working fine, however since this is the Live Audio, if there is a slight network problem, the audio stops and player does not continue after, even pressing the PlayPause button.Only way to resume the app is to kill it and restart each time.p  pCan someone, please, suggest anything or alternatives to AVPlayer or how can I buffer the Audio so if the connection is lost the player would buffer it in the mean time I am new to the IOS programming.

Negative 9622 pSo i came to this slight bump in the road. I created a custom tableview cell, in the tableviw cell class i override code[tableViewCell setSelectedTRUE animatedFALSE]code. In my codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode method i check some logic and if the logic is true then set the cell as selected using [codetableViewCell setSelectedTRUE animatedFALSE]code All if fine and dandy until i realized this. The system is calling code[tableviewCell setSelected]code implicitly after i explicitlty call codesetSelectedcode. When the system calls it my selected state is set to false when i explicitly set it to true. I know its the same tableview cell since im checking its memory location using self. I found an answer to fix this issue but it really makes no sense as to why this is happening. if I call code[tableView selectRowAtIndexPathindexPath animatedFALSE scrollPositionUITableViewScrollPositionNone]code the setSelected method is not called twice and it preserves the selected state i have set on the cell in my logic. So why does this way work and not just setting the cells selected statep

Negative 9622 pI have just installed zurbfoundation into my rails project that was already using Fullcalendar. After the install i immediately noticed that most of fullcalendars styling was messed with, some really obvious bugs occuring shaded areas now only half covering dates, button hoverstate is now half filled blue for no reason. Ideally id like my jsscss framework to have no effect on fullcalendars and other js plugins styles.p  pThere are a couple of potential solutionsp  pI could only take in bits of foundations SCSS and javascript so that i avoid the conflicting areas. I can find how to do this for the JS, but the SCSS doesnt seem to work when i remove  require foundation it seems to keep the scss there anyway, even when i try deleting the cache.p  pI could find the culprit areas of foundation and change them, but i dont really know where to start with that, the foundation file structure is weirdp  pLastly, i could ditch the framework all together and use something less invasive. As i can deal with making my own grid, and my own media queries, i have at least one front end man telling me to ditch frameworks all together, but i am just not much of a designer, so i was after buttons and navbars that look good out of the box. Are there good recommendations for lighter weighted sass frameworks that wont mess with stuff so much Or should i just roll up my sleeves and style my own buttons from scratch...p
