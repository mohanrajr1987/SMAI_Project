Positive 27758 pI have a container view controller with a fixed height view at the top and an embedded UINavigationController below it. The container view that embeds the UINavigationController has a Top Space constraint to the fixed height view, and a Bottom Space constraint to the top layout guide. This results in the navigation controllers height being 599 on an iPhone 6 the fixed height view at the top occupies the remaining 68 points. Ive verified the height of the navigtation controllers view at runtime in lldb.p  pHowever, when I push a UITableViewController into the embedded UINavigationController, the height of the UITableViewControllers table view is 667 points, not 599 as I would have expected. I can work around this by setting a bottom content inset of 68 points, but Id like to avoid this if possible.p  pWhat do I need to do to ensure that the height of the views of controllers pushed into this UINavigationController match the height of the navigation controllerp

Positive 27758 pI had a UINavigationController set as initial view controller. The root view controller for that navigation controller shows a menu where users can see product categories In case thats interesting for anyone . The root view controller loads JSON data from an URL, so it takes a little while until the view shows up which is fine. That data will be use in all the app, so its an important step.p  pWell, since the data load takes a while, I added a new UIViewController where I show an image with an UIActivityIndicator. Of course, the data load takes place in this UIViewController now instead of the root view controller.p  pSo, the idea is that after the data is loaded, the root view controller takes the place. To accomplish this I put an invisible UIButton on the new view controller and added a UIStoryboardSegue to the navigation controller, so I trigger that segue programmatically after the data is loaded.p  pAfter the data gets loaded, the navigation controller actually appears and shows of course the root view controller. The problem is when I click any button on the root view controller, the segue performs correctly, but from the second view controller UITableViewController if I press any cell, it takes me back to the new view controller the one that shows an image and loads the data. Well not actually any cell, because sometimes  it takes me actually forwards to the third view controller also UITableViewController, but the same problem occurs in this view controller. If I click the back button on the navigation bar in any view controller, it takes me back to the new view controller and not really back in the navigation stack.p  pHere is ViewDidLoadp  precodeoverride func viewDidAppearanimated Bool      super.viewDidAppearanimated      load.loadAllProducts     load.loadCategories      self.performSegueWithIdentifiermainStoryboardSegue, sender self  codepre  pAnd PrepareForSeguep  precodeoverride func prepareForSeguesegue UIStoryboardSegue, sender AnyObject      let destination  segue.destinationViewController as UINavigationController     let homeViewController  destination.viewControllers.first as HomeViewController     homeViewController.categories  load.categories     homeViewController.products  load.products  codepre  pI really appreciate any help, thanks a lotp

Positive 27758 pIve an application using an adaptive codeUISplitControllercode.

Positive 27758 pI have a custom push transition between view controllers embedded in a codeUINavigationControllercode which is working fine when built with iOS 78 but presents a wrong layout when built against iOS 9 SDK.p  precode voidanimateTransitionidltUIViewControllerContextTransitioninggttransitionContext    UIViewController fromViewController  [transitionContext viewControllerForKeyUITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey]   UIViewController toViewController  [transitionContext viewControllerForKeyUITransitionContextToViewControllerKey]    [transitionContext.containerView addSubviewtoViewController.view]    ... codepre  pIt then goes on and performs an animation. The issue is that the content of the codetoViewControllercode, even though it is using the right top layout guide auto layout constraint, presents the content behind the navigation bar.p  pNevertheless, it works fine on iOS 8 and if we force a redraw e.g., sending the app to the background and bring it back, present a modal on top and dismiss it, etc will cause the whole auto layout system to redraw itself and codetoViewControllercodes view jumps to the right place as being the top layout guide, x pixels from the navigation bar rather than x pixels from the top of the devices screen.p  pAdding p  precode[self.view setNeedsUpdateConstraints] [self.view layoutIfNeeded] codepre  pWorks if put in codeviewDidAppearanimatedcode, but does not work on codeviewDidLoadcode or codeviewWillAppearanimatedcode.

Positive 27758 pI have an UITabBarController that has 3 UINavigationController within. What I am trying to do, is on the push of a button on the UINavigationControllers bar, to drop the bar all the way down to right above the UITabBarControllers bar. I am doing this so that I can display in a pull down fashion, more content that would fill in the area above the now lowered UINavigationBar and then go away when it is moved up. So, in essence, I want to move around the UINavigationBar of a UINavigationController. I will only need this slideup down behavior of the UINavigationBar in the root view controllers of the respective UINavigationControllers of each tab. I have tried to just reposition the bar on the UINavigation controller like so...p  precode IBAction func moveBarDownsender AnyObject       self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame  CGRectx 100, y 500, width 100, height 100        note that I just used bogus values for demonstration purposes. codepre  pHowever, I get something like this...p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPoKbj.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPoKbj.png altenter image description hereap  pAs you can see, the navigation bar extends all the way to the top even though it only has a height of 100. This leads me to believe that I am not supposed to resize and move around the UINavigationBar on a UINavigationController and move it around. So, was thinking and researching some other ways of getting this same functionality. p  p1 Fake it I was thinking that I could just programmatically insert an identical but fake navigation bar not connected to a UINavigationController, hide the real UINavigationBar attached to the navigation controller, and then move the fake one around as needed. Then, on the slide up, I could move fake navigation bar back up, unhide the real one, and then delete the fake navigation bar.p  p2 Implement my own sort of navigation controller I was reading that I could use a container view to implement my own navigation controller. I am not familiar with doing such a thing, and dont even know if implementing my own UINavigationController would be a good thing to do.p  pSo, my question is, how would I achieve the desired functionality of moving the UINavigationBar on a UINavigationController Is there some way that I am totally missing Any comments, suggestions, or recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks.p
Positive 27758 pFor weeks Ive been scouring resources and searching for nonkiddo dev advice about making a customsized UIToolbar work in a UINavigationControllerbased app.  By work I mean a nonhackish approach that allows key things like graceful hideshow of the toolbar, swipetohide, and other graceful animations. p  pMaking a custom codeUIToolbarcode class instance that goes inside the codeUINavigationControllercode instance that overrides codesizeThatFitscode changes the size as expected, but theres a couple unacceptable issues as a result. p  pSo, here we have the common codesizeThatFitscode replacement offered by many p  precode     CGSize sizeThatFitsCGSizeinSize          CGSize sz  [super sizeThatFitsinSize]         sz.height  SSTOOLBARHEIGHT         return sz      codepre  pOk, great, the size is altered, but if you set breakpoints on that function, its clear that something else is still banging away for that ol 44 pt height.  Try setting a breakpoint there and see how often it gets called  seems fishy this will come into play later.p  pOk, fine, it changes the height as we like, so we move onto adding functionality so that the toolbar hides w animation on a touch or swipe.  Well, if we enable UINavigationControllers codehidesBarsOnSwipecode, then theres two problems the nav bar is tethered to the hiding yuck, emandem the toolbar gets completely hidden so that brining it back is totally nonWYSIWYG.  Our design goal is to get the toolbar operating like a drawer that slides inout on the appropriate swipe direction, independent of the nav bar.  Further rather than hiding the toolbar completely, wed like to have a lil stubtab thing maybe 1020 pts tall that indicates the user can slide the toolbar back upward like a drawer back to its normal state. p  pSo to do this, we alter codesizeThatFitscode in our UIToolbar derived classp  precode CGSize sizeThatFitsCGSizeinSize      CGSize sz  [super sizeThatFitsinSize]     sz.height  minimized  SSTOOLBARHEIGHTMINIMIZED  SSTOOLBARHEIGHT     return sz  codepre  pOn a minimize state change we would naturally hideshow the appropriate subviews so it would appear normally or be, say, 15 pts high with a little gripgraphic ditty.  So the major issue with this approach is that now any attempts at toolbar animation to slide it inout get totally b0rked thanks to codesizeThatFitscode getting called during animation and shortcircuiting it.  Ok Apple, fine, lets try hacks like setting the destination size elsewhere withp  precode CGSize sizeThatFitsCGSizeinSize      CGSize sz  [super sizeThatFitsinSize]     if  animationInProgress           sz.height  minimized  SSTOOLBARHEIGHTMINIMIZED  SSTOOLBARHEIGHT          return sz  codepre  pWell things just snowball at this point into insanity.  Calls to codesizeThatFitscode abound and attempts at drawerlike hideshow animation look even more broken as the 44 pt ghost size wins out, dorking everything up.p  pSo, in short, Im looking a pro dev to share infosuggestions on how to proceed with using a UINavigationController but having a toolbar with wellbehaved animated drawerlike behavior.  Ill settle for almost anything at this point, just that the minimized state is WYSIWYGfriendly so the user can get the toolbar back.  Maybe one approach is to make a tiny floating UIView that sits at the bottom and is shown only when the toolbar is hidden and when touched or swiped, the toolbar would be unhidden and animation would be fluid.  How and where would I persist such a floating viewp  pI guess what gets me about all this and why I feel like Im posting for help in exasperation is that the needed toolbar functionality discussed here seems like functionality most iOS developers would absolutely welcome and would see as a major improvement to UINavigationControllerUIToolbars current limitations.  p  pI have decent experience in iOS, but Im a OS X and Win vet of maaaany moons, so help from other pro devs is HIGHLY appreciated.   p  pThanks in advancep

Something is probably some kind of IO, and Im guessing its trying to resolve an external addressschemaDTD of some sort.p  pSo Im trying to find some kind of hook where I can monitor all IO. Either at VM level or at OS level I can run on both linux and windows but Im not allowed to run wireshark, and there is a theoretical possibility that it could be file IO.p  pAny suggestions on how I can track down what is happening p

Negative 27758 pI have two bitmap images. One contains a picture taken with a usb camera. The other will contain a shape, like a rectagle, but it can also be a trapezoid, or lets say, a random shape with only one color in it.

The last days I tried all possible audio techniques on the iphone, starting from AudioServicesPlaySystemSound and AVAudioPlayer and OpenAL to AudioQueues.p  pIn my last attempt I tried the CocosDenshion sound engine which uses openAL and allows to load sounds into multiple buffers and then play them whenever needed.

Negative 27758 pI am experiencing some strange behaviour in my Java server application whereby database operations that usually take a few milliseconds are sporadically taking much longer 30s  170s to complete.

The site uses the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions567407ocierrorrubyonrailsdelayedjobsa plugin to handle some background tasks and Id like to be able to run coderake jobsworkcode on the development server to periodically process all jobs in the queue due to the servers configuration, running a daemonized version of the script on the development server isnt an option.  However, whenever I try running the command, I get the following classic Oracle errorp  pcodeerror while trying to retrieve text for error ora12154codep  pOrdinarily, Id think this would be an authentication problem e.g. incorrect credentials in database.yml, but the site is up and running fine and doing lots of database stuff.  Ive tried adding codeRAILSENVproductioncode as a parameter to coderakecode to force it to run in in the production environment, but got the same error there are two separate rails installations for the production and development versions of the site, and Ive set the development and production credentials in developments db config file to be identical.p  pIm not sure what could be causing this error, and I dont have a ton of experience using Oracle with rails.  Any suggestionsp  pThanks a lotp  pJustinp  pEDIT 102609  Still cant figure out whats causing the problem here.  The app continues to run and talk to the database without a problem, but rake keeps throwing DB errors.  So does scriptconsole, which shows a prompt but first complains with the same Oracle error message.  Im going to keep looking, but Im running out of ideas...p  pEDIT102609, later Following the advice of a hrefhttprubyforge.orgforummessage.phpmsg5Fid40193 relnofollowthis linka, I set both codeORACLEHOMEcode and codeTNSADMINcode to point to the directory where tnsnames.ora lives.

Negative 27758 pI have an application in which endusers can size and position images in a designer. Since the spec calls for the image to be stretched to the containing control, the end user can end up with an awkwardly stretched image.p  pTo help the user with image sizing I am thinking of implementing a smart resizer function which would allow the the user to easily fix the aspect ratio of the picture so that it no longer appears stretched.p  pThe quick way to solve this is to actually provide two options 1 scale from width 2 scale from height. The user chooses the method and the algorithm adjusts the size of the picture by using the original aspect ratio. For example A picture is displayed as 200x200 on the designer but the original image is 1024x768 pixels. The user chooses Smart Size from width and the new size becomes 200x150 since the original aspect ratio is 1.333p  pThats OK, but how could I make the algorithm smarter and not bother the user by asking which dimension the recalculation should be based on p

Negative 27758 pive a contentcontrol in my WpfApp MVVM which is bound to an object and displays the objects properties in textboxes, so the user can edit the values of the properties. I want to implement undoredo functionality with the command pattern of the GoF. For this i need a point where i can create the command and set it into my undomanager. My idea was to add a submitbutton. When the button is pressed, i update the sources of the textboxes my properties and create my command object to make the changes undoable saving the old state of the object and the new state. But  For using a submit button i need to set UpdateSourceTrigger of the textboxes to Explicit. If i want to update my sources i need to reference the controls in my view, which is bad as far as ive learned. How can i do that With MVVM i have to create a Command WPF Command, not my undo redo command for the SubmitButton but i dont see how to apply the changes to the properties from that command without referencing the textboxes further hey are generated via datatemplates.p  pThanks Walterp

If I were to point directly at the rdlc using a local path, I have no idea how I can properly initialise the ObjectDataSource  it relies on dependency injection and has a lot of dependencies.p  pIf I point at a URL, I presumably need a reporting server up  and if the report lives on there, theres no way it can reference my business logicDAL  Which means Im maintaining 2 methods of accessing data in parallel  which seems awful to me.p  pIm obviously approaching this wrong but most of the tutorials I can find assume the reports all live in the UI layer and have data sources specified on the webform itself  which is not what I need in this case. In theory, I should be able to provide a winforms frontend to the BL and have it generate exactly the same report with minimal effort.p  pCan someone please point me in the right direction.p  pMany thanksp  pIn case its relevant, Im using .Net 4, VS2010, MVC 2 and IIS 7.p

How can I achieve thatp  ol liI would like the modal window to open only once per session, even if there are multiple instances of firefox.

Right now, I accomplish that through a simple window.close associated with the cancel button of the dialog. However, since the original load which triggered the modal dialog is called after the page finishes loading, I can see a small glimpse of the homepage before it closes due to window.closethis is not elegant. Is there an event similar to beforepageload What is the proper way to accomplish this goal.li ol  pThank you very much, and your input will be very helpful.

This is NOT what I want to do, I would like it to build and emulate  install on device as usual. p  pIs there any way to change this behavior in Eclipsep

Negative 27758 pI want to create a python script that polls a folder that a java server will fill with images when a user transfers them, however I want this script to be almost as invisible as possible in terms of noticeable effects.

Negative 27758 pI have a facebook token which is getting the graph.facebook.commehome url just fine. On posts with pictures, I would like to pull out the picture ID from the post so I can get detailed information about the sizes and urls to different images. p  pThe problem is that on this feed, I dont see any privacy fields for most users. But the way these URLs work vary widely. For example, a photo can be viewed while logged out of facebook. A photo can be viewed as long as you are logged in as anyone. A photo is private. When I query graph.facebook.comphotoID most of the time I get false. Is there some permission that I should be getting from users that I dont have here Is this restricted not by the user perhaps but by the permission of the friends photo I noticed that in at least one case, I cold only get false on a photoID, but logged in to my personal account not knowing this person at all I could see their photo fine. These inconsistent levels of security are confusing to me.p  pI would like a way to tell what kind of link this is going to be before I bother querying the photoID or sending the URL on for further processing. Is there a way to force an extra field on the feed or is there some field that contains the data that Im just not seeingp

Negative 27758 pLets say I create a matrix M1 of 5 rows and 1 column of 8UC3 type to store RGB components of an image.Then I create another matrix M2 of 5 rows and 3 columns of 8UC1 type to again store the RGB components of the image.p  pIs there a difference in the way these 2 types of matrices are stored inaccessed from the memory From what I understand from a hrefhttpwww.cs.iit.eduagamcs512lectnotesopencvintroopencvintro.htmlSECTION00053000000000000000 relnofollowhttpwww.cs.iit.eduagamcs512lectnotesopencvintroopencvintro.htmlSECTION00053000000000000000a commonly recommended OpenCV tutorial on Stackoverflow, the data pointer of the matrix points to the first index of the data arraythe matrix is internally stored as an array and the various RGB components are stored in an interwoven fashionin case of 8UC3. p  pMy logic says that they should be the same as in case of 1 column 8UC3M1, for each column RGB components are stored, and in the case of 3 columns 8UC1M2, each column stores the RGB component. I hope I have been able to formulate my question well. p  pThanks in advance p

If not, a new bucket is created.li ul  pSo for each document, depending on the logic for separating buckets, the document may end up like thisp  precodeltbodygt   ltdiv classFormatOnegt     lth1gtTitle 1lth1gt     ltpgtparagraph 11ltpgt     ltpgtparagraph 12ltpgt     lth3gtSubtitle 2lth3gt     ltulgt       ltligtlist item 21ltligt       ltligtlist item 22ltligt       ltligtlist item 23ltligt       ltligtlist item 24ltligt     ltulgt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classFormatTwogt     ltspan classwarningTextgt       Warning This product could kill you     ltspangt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classFormatOnegt     ltspan classdisclaimerTextgt You were warnedltspangt     ltp classcopyrightgtCopyright 19992011ltpgt   ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pthisp  precodeltbodygt   ltdiv classFormatOnegt     lth1gtTitle 1lth1gt     ltpgtparagraph 11ltpgt     ltpgtparagraph 12ltpgt     lth3gtSubtitle 2lth3gt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classFormatTwogt     ltulgt       ltligtlist item 21ltligt       ltligtlist item 22ltligt       ltligtlist item 23ltligt       ltligtlist item 24ltligt     ltulgt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classFormatOnegt     ltspan classwarningTextgt       Warning This product could kill you     ltspangt     ltspan classdisclaimerTextgt You were warnedltspangt     ltp classcopyrightgtCopyright 19992011ltpgt   ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  por even thisp  precodeltbodygt   ltdiv classFormatOnegt     lth1gtTitle 1lth1gt     ltpgtparagraph 11ltpgt     ltpgtparagraph 12ltpgt     lth3gtSubtitle 2lth3gt     ltulgt       ltligtlist item 21ltligt       ltligtlist item 22ltligt       ltligtlist item 23ltligt       ltligtlist item 24ltligt     ltulgt     ltspan classwarningTextgt       Warning This product could kill you     ltspangt     ltspan classdisclaimerTextgt You were warnedltspangt     ltp classcopyrightgtCopyright 19992011ltpgt   ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pdepending on how the sections are defined.p  pIs there a way to use an XSLT to perform this type of grouping magicp  pAny help would be great.

Negative 27758 pI am an mechanical engineer with some programing skills and I need some advice from much more experience people from programing. I am writing an optimization platform that will involve at least at the beginning one commercial optimization tool, one commercial design program and one my program written in C. The platform should prepare case for optimization tool which will run all necessary programs in right order. This part with setting optimization tool from my platform is not a problem because I had some training and they have very good instructions. Also communication with this commercial design program is quite easy because it use OLE interface and has a large number of examples of it. The part with which I have a great problem is providing of a large flexibility to my program. The calculations are mainly based on empirical correlations and I do not want to put them inside a code. I need to take them out to provide easy access in case of new data and new correlations. I am not writing only about changing of some coefficients but about changing of whole equations. For example let say that something is described with equation X  AY3  BY2CYD. ABCD are coefficients and Y is value taken from object in program and X is of course solution. But there can be another correlation for this which can take into account another value from object from program. X  AY2  BZ2 YZ. So I need a way to take out all correlations from my code put them in separete files and be able to create new ones so they will have access to object properties in my code.  I was thinking about using Python macros because in this commercial design program it works weary well, exactly in the way I have described but the more I reed about this the more I do not know if it will work. I am writing Windows Form application and I use VS 2010. First problem is that  is unmanaged and whole program is managed.  So I used something like thisp  precodepragma unmanaged ifdef DEBUG undef DEBUG include ltpython.hgt define DEBUG endif pragma managed codepre  pAt least program compile but I have problem with casting unmanaged types of variables from Pyton to managed in C.p  pSo my first questionp  ol lipIs it possible to use Python as macro scripting tool in Windows Form application written in VSpli lipWhere can I get more information about this I read Python docs, and some tutorials in the web but there are all in Win32 console application.pli lipMaybe I should try to use boost It will help mepli lipIs there some easy and simple way to do this   If someone would show me a simple form application with one button, one textBox and one class with two properties A and B and macro in Python in separate file that would return X  A  B  2 to this text box he would be my heropli lipIf answer to first four questions is negative pleas at least give me some hints how I can do this in other way.

Negative 27758 pIm doing a project which involves Core Animation and AV Foundation. I want to use Core Animation to render some effects, then export it to video file via AV Foundation. The animation effect I want to achieve is replaying enduser signing hisher signature on the iPad.p  pstrongWhat Ive achieved so farstrong   With referring GLPainter sample from Apple, Im able to record the strokes of user signature, each individual stroke is composed of a number of touch points CGPoint which have been recorded in touchBegintouchMovedtouchEnd method of my custom UIView.   Driven by a repeatable NSTimer, Im able to redraw it on my custom UIView. Mainly its a repeating process of drawing line from one point to the next.p  pstrongWhat Im trying to dostrong  implement the signature redrawing with Core Animation technology, then later on, embedded the core animation code with Av Foundation composition code to render the final output.p  pstrongWhat concerns me nowstrongp  ul liKnowing nothing about Core Animation, Ive been learning it in the last few days. However, the tutorialsbooks Ive read only tells me how to make implicit animation by altering CALayers properties, or make CAKeyframeAnimation. But my animation is sort of drawing something on the layers canvas progressively instead of moving something. So, how to do this in Core Animationli ul  pstrongWhat Im doing nowstrong is quite similar to what I did with Quartz2D, I use a NSTimer to repeatedly set my CALayer object needsDisplay, which in turn invokes its delegates implementation of drawLayerinContext method, where I write fairly the same code as I wrote in UIViews drawRect. p  pWell, I did kind of emanimationem, without any CAAnimation involved. Im just feeling weird, feeling Im doing it wrong. I havent proceeded to the combining Core Animation with AV Foundation part, but I doubt my heck wont get through.p  pI did honest search in SO I swear but found nothing related. My experience in Quartz2D and Core Animation is quite limited I have to say, so, really appreciate if someone could give me some hints, thank you p

Negative 27758 pI have a program which starts a thread using pthreads that will do some background task for the remainder of the program.

How could I do itp  pThe main reason for all this is that I want to be able have code completion for python objects that are created inside my application and let Eclipse know about them. Similar to remote variable debugging.p

I have tried adding a new datasource from a DataSet, but that only allows to add 1 table in the datagridview as far as I can tell.p  pNext I wanted to create a Entity Framework model and bind that to the DataGridView. I have created a new model named codeModel1code, but the model is not accessible anywhere in my code. Is there something wrong with my logicp  pI have also tried after creating the model to create a DataSource from an object trying to select the model as the object, but it wasnt visible in the wizard.p  pOr is there another way to bind a simple codeLEFT JOINcode into a DataGridViewp
Negative 27758 pIs it possible to reload the main view of a view controller from its XIB file in its viewWillAppear method The method make significant changes to the view, which would be difficult to reverse. When the view controller gets pushed off the navigation stack, the method has to deal with a changed view. It would be much easier if I could just relax the view from the XIB. It seems that the Apple implementation assumes that the view will remain static, and can therefore be reused.p

Negative 27758 pSo one of the problems with Java is that you wind up with duplicate libraries on the same system. Now that we have products like maven, Ive been wondering why this still needs to be the case. For example, one might have a central final releaseonly repo for all running java applications on a particular machine or a particular application server. For app servers, if you created a singular dependency on something that handles dependencies programmatically, perhaps through a mavenlike mechanism in the Spring configuration, couldnt you have all of your dependencies just handled automagically  If it couldnt be done in the Spring configuration, then perhaps the container could be extended I suppose the trick might be building the Classpath but that really doesnt seem insurmountable. Especially since the top 3 OSs now all have symbolic links. Havent looked in quite a while but it appears there is now a way to handle andor create them in Javap  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialiolinks.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialiolinks.htmlap  pOf course symbolic links might even be overkill. p  pI suppose what I am asking is, couldnt you use these ideas to greatly simplify dependency management or deployment for all Java SE  Java EE applicationsp

Negative 27758 pEDIT Managed to test it all and I guess my friend was wrong here, thanks for the help, people. p  pFrom what I understand the second example with the alias is useful when referring to an object types field. For example, I went ahead and made an object table of managerType called manager with the following attributesp  precodeName NameTypename VARCHAR230, surname VARCHAR230, Address AddressTypeFirstLine VARCHAR230, City VARCHAR230, PostCode VARCHAR28, Salary NUMBER codepre  pNow for this question I needed to retrieve the city of a particular manager, so the following would not workp  precodeSELECT City FROM Manager Where name like Jim codepre  pHowever, this did workp  precodeSELECT m.address.city from Manager m  WHERE m.name.fname LIKE Jim AND m.name.lname LIKE Smith codepre  pTheres probably a way I could avoid using the AND operator here, if anyone knows, Id appreciate it. I hope this helps someone. Thanks.p  hr  h2Original Questionh2  pThis has been confusing me for a while. Im doing a past exam paper for revision and for one question I must retrieve the salaries of all managers whose names start with J from a Manager Object table.p  pId normally do the followingp  precodeSELECT salary FROM Manager WHERE name like J codepre  pNow a fellow student has gone and confused me by suggesting that I must use an alias as its an object table, so itd be something likep  precodeSELECT m.Salary  FROM Manager m  WHERE name like J codepre  pI know this one is useful for field access in Oracle say if I had a user defined type in Manager table and wanted to refer to a field in that type but should I be using it in generalp

Negative 27758 pIm trying to create a macro that executes when a file is saved from Word or Excel 2007.

Negative 27758 pIm interested in writing performant code across several compilers GCC, MSVC, Clang. Ive seen two patterns for passing functions as compile time arguments, and Im curious if compilers are usually smart enough to recognize the two are equivalent, or if Im asking too much. Heres the STL style, passing a functor objectp  precode  templateltclass InputIterator, class Predicategt   InputIterator findif  InputIterator first, InputIterator last, Predicate pred         for   firstlast  first  if  predfirst  break     return first    codepre  pAnd heres the alternative stylep  precode  templateltclass InputIterator, class Predicate, class PredDatagt   InputIterator findif  InputIterator first, InputIterator last, PredData data         for   firstlast  first  if  Predicateevalfirst, data  break     return first    codepre  pIn the STL style, your Predicate class typically contains as members any data it needs, and you call operator to evaluate the predicate. In the alternative style, you never have a Predicate object, rather it contains a static method that takes the item to be checked, and the data is passed as an argument rather than stored as a member on Predicate.p  pI have a few fears using the STL stylep  ol liIf Predicate is a word or smaller, will the compiler be smart enough to pass it by register In the alternative style the word would be an argument, so the compiler doesnt have to infer anything.li liIf Predicate is empty, will it be smart enough to avoid instantiating and passing it In the alternative style Predicate is never instantiated.li ol  pSo my intuition is the alternative style should be faster, but perhaps Im underestimating modern optimizers.p

Negative 27758 pIm implementing a client server solution where the server constantly sends a stream of messages over TCP to the client.p  pWhen I do some testing and connect the client and server directly in memory through code, I get very high throughput. When I use TCP over the network, I get a much lower throughput. This is not surprising. However, Im having a hard time diagnosing and understanding where the bottleneck is.p  pIt seems that the client doesnt receive the messages as fast as the server produces them. The server is too fast. If I stop the server from sending anymore messages, I can see that actually the client still receives some messages from the server from several seconds up to 20 seconds even though the server stops sending message at the application level.  So Im guessing that TCP is trying to be smart and is throttling the server message rate, causing the messages to be queued on the server, interestingly.p  pHow can I actually verify that this is what is really happening How can I detect this situation programmatically Or with tools I run under Windows XP and I found a Windows performance counter called Output queue length under the category Network interface length of the output packet queue in packets. However this remains to 0 all the time both server and client...p  pOne more thing, I was expecting both the sender and receiver to have high CPU usage but it doesnt go that high. Again Im guessing that its because of the network side effects. Is there anyway to measure the overhead incurred by TCP processing checksum and other stuffp  pTo give you an idea, the server sends about 1.5M bytes per second.p

Negative 27758 pIve read similar questions here, but am still not clear on a couple of things. Using a Library Project means that my overall project will have two manifests  one for the library and the other for the main app project  and Im not clear what goes in which or if there is some redundancy.p  pIm developing an app widget with lite and paid versions, so will have almost all code in a library project. Being a widget, the library will have at least a receiver, a service, a configuration activity, plus a couple of other activities. So where should the full declarations of these components  including intents, filters, etc.  be declared Do they go in the manifest for the library, or in the manifest for the application package itself, referencing the classes in the library e.g. androidnamecom.foo.mylibrary.MyServicep  pSome examples Ive looked at seem to declare them in both manifests, but I suspect that putting these in one or the other is a noop.p

Negative 27758 pI am thoroughly confused about how this worksp  pI have a partial view that is rendered by the controller.  This partial view is rendered via Ajax call and is served by an ActionResult of a controller.  Partial View is strongly typed and is rendered with a model via p  precodereturn this.PartialViewOuterPartialView, modelObject. codepre  pInside this partial view, I am rendering another partial view, also strongly typed and bound to the same model, via the code Html.RenderPartialHiddenVariablesView, Model code call that renders a small section of Hidden variables I use HiddenFor to inject them into the form.p  pstrongIssue isstrong the hidden input variables are rendered in the HTML as emptydefault values of the model  as if the model that was passed was simply created via default constructor.  Whats even more strange, is that when I put a breakpoint inside the partial view generation HiddenVariablesView as well as OuterPartialView I can see that my Model object is correctly populated.p  pWould appreciate any advicep  pstrongEDITstrong The OuterPartialView has a form that submits back to itself via ajax and basically replaces itself with a new version of itself inside a div.  It appears that the model for the partial view is reverting back to the model that was originally created when the OuterPartialView was constructed via GET method of the action controller.  Any POST methods of the controller are called during the submits, but the changes to model that are done inside the controller are not reflecting in the generated HTMLp

Negative 27758 pIm in the process of adding JMS capabilities via ActiveMQ to an existing SpringHibernate web application. Consequently, Im wanting to add XAJTA capabilities to this app such that I can manage transactions with Spring which span both the data store and the message broker.p  pIve been successful with the ActiveMQ integration, but, Im running into problems with incorporating XAJTA into the application. Specifically, no data is being insertedupdated into underlying database though, I see no errorsexceptions during the transaction.p  pDetails Spring 3.1.2.RELEASE, Hibernate 3.6.10.Final, ActiveMQ 5.6.0p  pIm using Spring Data JPA for writing my DAO interfaces and they, in turn, pick up my LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean to do their CRUD work.p  pIve tried with both Atomikos 5.6.0 and Bitronix 2.1.3 XAJTA implementations. Each results in same behavior no data being written to underlying database tables.p  pI have a lot of logging and can certainly provide log excerpts if desired. And, configuration details as well. Of particular note in the logs, Spring seems to indicate that JTA transaction is trying to commit. Given the lack of data written to underlying db, though, its not clear if it actually completes the commit again, though, I see no errors indicating that it did not. Also, its worth noting that this particular transaction  populateSampleData  involves just the database resource no message broker involvement at all.p  precode20120814 131609,770 DEBUG

doing incorrectly or missing. Ive basically followed the prescription in a hrefhttpblog.springsource.com20110815configuringspringandjtawithoutfulljavaee relnofollowthis articlea with a bit of additional info gathered from the Atomikos web site in the Atomikos case.p  pThanks for any enlightenment you can provide.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I resolved my issue. The problem was that I was not using a persistence.xml file but rather configuring the persistenceunit programmatically when setting up the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean using the setPackagesToScan method. While the persistenceunit was indeed loading my Entity classes properly, due to the absence of the persistence.xml file specifically, the absence of the transactiontype attribute of the persistenceunit element the transactiontype was being defaulted to RESOURCELOCAL which is the default for nonJava EE containers. Im now explicitly providing a persistence.xml file and explicitly setting transactiontypeJTA.p

Negative 27758 pRelated to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12100856combinings4ands3methodsinasinglefunctionthisa question, but slightly different and hopefully more clear.p  pI am looking for a emcleanem way to formally register methods for both S4 and S3 classes, but without relying on the terrible S3dotnamingscheme for dispatching. An examplep  precodesetClassfoo setClassbar  setGenerictest, functionx, ...     standardGenerictest   setMethodtest, bar, functionx, ...     returnsuccess bar.   obj1 lt 123 classobj1 lt bar testobj1 codepre  pThis example shows how we can register a codetestcode method for S3 objects of class codebarcode, without the need to name the function codetest.barcode, which is great. However, the limitation is if we register methods this way, they will only be dispatched to the first S3 class of the object. E.gp  precodeobj2 lt 123 classobj2 lt cfoo, bar testobj2 codepre  pThis doesnt work, because S4 method dispatching will only try class codefoocode and its superclasses. How could this example be extended so that it will automatically select the codetestcode method for codebarcode when no appropriate method for codefoocode was found E.g. S3 style dispatching but without having to go back to naming everything codetest.foocode and codetest.barcode p  pSo in summary how to create a generic function that uses formal method dispatching, but in addition fall back on the second, third, etc class of an object for S3 objects with multiple classes.p

Negative 27758 pI am using a custom cell renderer that implements TableCellRenderer and displays JTextArea instead of JLabel for each row. I am basically overriding getTableCellRendererComponent... method with mine which does some additional calculations per row. These calculations have to be done just once per table update. Since getTableCellRendererComponent method is being called with every mouse move, lag occurs. So I thought I should prevent getTableCellRendererComponent from being called to avoid lag.p  pConsiderationsp  p1 My table has only 1 column and has no header.p  p2 My data is static and is read from an ArrayList by getValueAtint row, int column method in a custom tablemodel class implementing AbstractTableModel.p  p3 I dont need to watch over mouse motion events.p  p4 I dont expect much data, so I might want to display whole table at once or cache it completely.p  p5 Most lag is caused by setting text each time when returning from getTableCellRendererComponent, because some rows are using RighttoLeft chars and RTL text requires extra time to render.p

Negative 27758 pI know there are many resources on this topic, but since English is not my native language and this is my first day with Python, I need some help could someone explain to me the meaning of codeclassmethodcode and codestaticmethodcode I need to know not only the difference but also the meaning. Ive read through some documentation, but I literally could not understand it. If someone could give me a clear definition and an example, that would be great  I learn best from example.p  pAs far as I understand, codeclassmethodcode tells a class that its a method which should be inherited into subclasses, or... something. However, whats the point of that Why not just define the class method without adding codeclassmethodcode or codestaticmethodcode or any codecode definitionsp  pstrongtldrstrong emwhenem should I use them, emwhyem should I use them, and emhowem should I use themp  pIm pretty advanced with C, so using more advanced programming concepts shouldnt be a problem.

Negative 27758 pCannot open .cpp file in gedit editor on Ubuntu 11.10. The file was created with an ofstream object in a program I wrote in C. The program compiles and runs without any errors, after which it opens a file, reads from it line by line appending each line to a stdstring object until reaching the end, then returns the string to main, which then outputs it to a separate file which it creates on the hard drive.  However, when attempting to open and display the file in gedit, the editor just hangs and no text is displayed no matter how long I wait, and if I wait too long, when I try to close it, it will say its not responding and I have to force quit it. In the preview icon of the file in the nautilus file browser, it shows the output file as only having a single line of text, while the input file of course shows the whole page filled up with text. That should not be the case, since the output file should contain the same number of lines as the input file, only difference being a few lines of text were changed.p  pAnyone have any idea what could be causing thisp  pNote that the input file is quite long, and contains 136871 lines of code, so maybe that has something to do with it.p  pHere is the code of the program that creates the output filep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltfstreamgt include ltstringgt  using namespace std  string fixIssueSegmentationFaultifstreamamp filehandle  int main   coutltlt Thank you for running FixChtml4tagsIssues.n        This little program has been written with the intent of fixingn        the issues in the Chtml4tags.h file of the MAW programming project.n     ltlt endl     ltlt Please hit Enter to fix the detected issues. ltltendl cin.get  coutltlt Thank you.

TYPEattrvaluesamp attrsupportedattrvalues  attrsupportedattrvaluesmap[dummybrowser] ... attrsupportedattrvalues.clear attrsupportedattrvaluesmap.clear ... attrsupportedattrvalues  attrsupportedattrvaluesmap[dummybrowser]  Explanation Inside constructor of Chtml4tags, I created a map for the supported attr values of each Html attribute I created for each Html tag in the constructor. The map uses an Sbrowser object for its key and an object of TYPEattrvalues which is a typedef of stdvectorltShtmlattrvaluegt for its mapped value. Therefore, I created a TYPEattrvaluesamp called attrsupportedattrvalues to reference the associated mapped value vector of the dummybrowser object, which is just a dummy browser object I created so I could create a list of standard Html 4.01 attributes which exist in the specification for now, and later create a list of attributes from that list for each browser, according to which attribute values each browser supports note this will be done at the next level up Chtml4elements. The code line  TYPEattrvaluesamp attrsupportedattrvalues  attrsupportedattrvaluesmap[dummybrowser]  is where I first create that reference and initialize it to the returned reference of the [] operator of the map, which performs an insert operation if the key passed does not already exist inside the map. And the code line  attrsupportedattrvalues  attrsupportedattrvaluesmap[dummybrowser]  is where I reinitialize or at least thats what I thought it did when I first wrote the code... the reference to the returned reference again, for each Html attribute after the first attribute. I then attempt to clear after each attribute operations both the referenced vector and then the map before reusing the reference attrsupportedattrvalues. However, that is what created the segmentation fault. It turns out you cannot use the same reference on more than one object, unlike pointers. So it is invalid to reinitialize that reference to point to a new object for each attribute, thus creating the problem. Oddly enough, though, doing this didnt actually produce any compiler errors. It compiles ok, but when attempting to run the program, it will return a message saying the program unexpectedly exited when running it normal, and you only get the extra info about the segmentation fault when running the debugger on it.  Im not sure why that is, but its probably by design. And so it did take me a bit to figure out why the attrsupportedattrvalues  attrsupportedattrvaluesmap[dummybrowser] lines was producing the segmentation fault, especially since the attribute it ended on was not actually the second attribute of the first tag, but rather the first attribute of the second tag. I still dont know why that is, but at any rate, I believe that after I change the attrsupportedattrvalues identifier to a pointer instead of a reference, and adjust all lines using it to treat it as a pointer instead of a reference, the problem SHOULD be fixed. But well certainly see how it goes...   Steps for fixing issue  1. Read each line of Chtml4tags.cpp until reaching the end, checking each line as we go to see if it contains the target string content. In addition, add the content of each line regardless of whether it contains the target or not to outputstr. Note that the target string content is first TYPEattrvaluesamp attrsupportedattrvalues  attrsupportedattrvaluesmap[dummybrowser] which needs to be changed to TYPEattrvalues attrsupportedattrvalues  ampattrsupportedattrvaluesmap[dummybrowser], and then is the  attrsupportedattrvalues.clear attrsupportedattrvaluesmap.clear  lines which needs to be changed to  attrsupportedattrvaluesgtclear attrsupportedattrvaluesmapgtclear  2. If the target is found in the current line, perform the necessary changes to the lines content i.e. bufferstr before adding it to outputstr. 3. Return outputstr. string outputstr string bufferstr string searchstr1  TYPEattrvaluesamp attrsupportedattrvalues  attrsupportedattrvaluesmap[dummybrowser] string replacementstr1  TYPEattrvalues attrsupportedattrvalues  ampattrsupportedattrvaluesmap[dummybrowser] string searchstr2  attrsupportedattrvalues.clear string replacementstr2  attrsupportedattrvaluesgtclear string searchstr3  attrsupportedattrvaluesmap.clear string replacementstr3  attrsupportedattrvaluesmapgtclear sizet pos while getlinefilehandle, bufferstr       if filehandle.good  i.e. no errors while reading lines         if pos  bufferstr.findsearchstr1, 0  stringnpos             bufferstr.replacepos, searchstr1.size, replacementstr1                   else if pos  bufferstr.findsearchstr2, 0  stringnpos             bufferstr.replacepos, searchstr2.size, replacementstr2                   else if pos  bufferstr.findsearchstr3, 0  stringnpos             bufferstr.replacepos, searchstr3.size, replacementstr3                  outputstr  bufferstr         return outputstr   codepre

Negative 27758 pI am pretty new in GAE and python. The challenge is to make nested comments with, for example, 3 levels of identation.  GAEdatastore does half work for us.

In other words we need to pass a parameter to our template for each item. Let call this paremeters 0,1,2. I have solution but I dont like it. I count value of parameter of ident this wayp  precodeidentvalue  lenCURRENITEM.key.topath2  2 codepre  pEach level in GAE hierarchy path consists of 2 elements.p  pSo after fetching model from datastore this cycle is executingp  precodefor model in modellist                 newmodellist.appendmodel  helper list     identvalue  lenmodel.key.topath2  2      if identvaluegt3 identvalue  3  max ident  3     setattrnewmodellist[i], ident, identvalue      i  1   codepre  pAnd then newmodellist is passing to jinja template where class name for each item is assigned based on model.ident value.

Negative 27758 pIs it possible to create a new macro using C using the Interop library in Microsoft Access in a similar fashion as Word, Excel, or PowerPoint  In the other applications, you have access to codeMicrosoft.Vbe.Interop.VBComponentcode, which allows you to inject new macros, through the codeDocumentcode, codeWorksheetcode, or codePresentationcode classes.

Negative 27758 pI have a container DIV4, which contains two other DIVs DIV2 and DIV3 sidebyside. DIV4 is contained inside another DIV DIV1. Some info about each DIVp  pDIV1 position is absolute. Its essentially a popup window to view a larger version of the image when a thumbnail image is clicked. It is simply moved onscreen to make it appear, and offscreen when the link is clicked to close it. Since the content can vary, it has no fixed width or height.p  pDIV2 A series of nested DIVs, these contain the large image, and use the nested DIVs to generate a frame and matting for the image. The DIV with the image itself as a background image has a specified width and height the outer DIVs including DIV2 do not, they simply use their margin and border settings to fit around the DIVs contained inside them.p  pDIV3 Contains a series of P and INPUT tags, with BR tags to easily control their vertical positions.p  pDIV4 Has no attributes, simply used to group DIV2 and DIV3 separately from other content of DIV1 that follows below them.p  pOriginally, I tried using float left on DIV2 to bring DIV3 up next to it. However, I believe the problem is that DIV1 and DIV4 do not have a specified width, so the browser doesnt know if theres enough space to move DIV3 next to DIV2. In IE, it positioned DIV3 correctly, but Firefox dropped all of DIV3 below DIV2. So I looked for another solution besides floats. I was able to use display inlineblock on both DIV2 and DIV3. This puts them side by side in both browsers.p  pHowever, DIV3 is appearing vertically centered relative to DIV2. I want the top of DIV3 to be in line with the top of DIV2. I have read about using position absolute on DIV3 in this case to force it to the top, and position relative on their container DIV4 but I would also have to specify a left position for DIV3, and since the width of DIV2 varies, that would be a problem.p  pI havent posted any code because Im not really sure which parts would be useful to see, and the entire content of the DIVs along with their CSS would be pages of code some of the DIVs are written dynamically with PHPMYSQL. Hopefully my description of the situation will be adequate.p  pHeres an image of how I want it to look a hrefhttpi46.tinypic.comqstks1.gif relnofollowhttpi46.tinypic.comqstks1.gifap  pOnce again, I think the main problem I am having with standard solutions of using floats or absolute positioning is that every DIV is variable in height and width. I emalmostem have this solved with inlineblocks, except for the vertical positioning of DIV3 relative to DIV2.p  pEDIT Per request, I put up some code on JSFiddle. However, the displayed result isnt at all like how it actually looks, which I knew would be the case. This code is included into another php file, which itself is included into the index.php. Most of the php variables are set in the index.php according to standard MVC practices. So it doesnt really work at all without access to all those other files, not to mention the MySQL database that it obtains the image filename from and which it uses to determine the height and width of the image. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netTechnetiumGKUgY relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netTechnetiumGKUgYap  pIt wont let me submit this without putting code inline for some reason do they really want me to put that whole thing here, so heres some bogus code just to let me edit the post... ignore this. codesensefalsecodep  pThis is the entire imageviewer.php file, and the entire CSS file.

Negative 27758 pI am currently exploring jQuery Mobiles functionalities. I am quite intrigued by the way Google Play Store handles horizontal sliding, hence, when the user slide taps to the right, the view should slide to the next page and when the user slide taps to the left the view should scroll to the previous page, if any. I know this can be done using native jQuery but Im not yet familiar with events on mobile devices and Im sure there is already a builtin functionality for this.  p  pId like to try this first with Android devices and if possible with iPad and iPhone. Can anybody guide me on ways to accomplish thisp  pBTW, Im not talking about browser history here, probably just some div, pages, if possible.p

Negative 27758 pwe are using nodehttpproxy for a while and it works fine. But as our system grows bigger, we want to move to nginx.p  pWe consume about 100 request per second at the moment, which produce an outgoing traffic of about 1mbs.p  pOur tests with nginx same amount of requests, same backend servers and same responses produce an outgoing traffic of about 4mbs. We checked the headers, because that could have been the only difference in the response, but the headers didnt change that much.p  pDoes anyone have an idea what else could produce this traffic increasep  pThanks, Kimp  pEDIT We dont use clustering, they are just dumb reverse proxies. Requests from domain A go to server A, domain B to server B, ... We did tests in our production environment, so the backend servers stayed the same during tests, just the proxies changed.p

Negative 27758 pI have a color image with number of rows 479 and columns 638. I am trying to save this image as a BMP file. For this I am first using codeCreateDIBSectioncode and then using codeCreateDIBitmapcode. For the codeCreateDIBSectioncode I need to pass the codeBITMAPINFOHEADERcode to the function. Here it has two parameters codebiWidthcode and codebiSizeImagecode. Since the memory returned by the function should be DWORD aligned, and code638code is not a multiple of code4code should I pass 638 or 640 as the width  Assume that I pass 638 as the width, will the memory returned by the function be 638 x 479 or 640 x 479  My observation is that it is the 640 x 479. In this case when I save the file as a BMP a 2 pixel wide black line appears at the end of each row. How do I avoid this I am passing codebiCompressioncode as codeBIRGBcode if that matters.p

Negative 27758 pIm working on developing a onlinejudge type system where maybe 100 or so untrusted executables will all be running simultaneously and evaluating the same input data.p  pId like each executable to be limited to an equal share of CPU, memory, disk space, etc. of a predefined resource pool. For example if the resource pool were set to 34 of the machines CPU, 3 GB of memory, 300 GB of disk, and 2 executables were running, each would get 38 of the CPU, 1.5 GB of memory, 150 GB of disk. If another were to join in, the resource would be readjusted into three equal slices. This is to prevent a malicious or buggy executable from stealing resources from others as well as to give everyone equal resources.p  pIdeally, Id also like the executables to not be constrained to a single language e.g. let users develop in whatever theyre comfortable  C, C, Java, Python, etc..p  pUsing a whole VM or something like OpenVZ seems like overkill. Are there lighter weight alternatives that essentially use a separate process for each executable while limiting its resources, disabling things like network access, process spawning, etc. Part of the reason Im looking for a light weight solution is that theres quite a bit of input data  would rather not have to copy it to each executable but let them read from shared memory.p
Negative 27758 pIve seen others ask this but I think my requirement is the most strict yet p  pI need to programmatically convert MS Word .DOC Office 2003 or earlier or .DOCX Office 2007 or later files into PDF files. This needs to happen on an adhoc basis over time  not once, not with a set of files sitting on my desktop right now. p  pMy platform runs in the cloud, so I have no server on which to run one of the many serverside conversion tools out there and I cannot write a VB or C or Java application in which to make this happen. For instance, I cannot use Aspose.words or Libre Office since I have no computer on which to install them or an app that uses them.p  pI am thinking I need a strongclientsidestrong, web browserbased solution, JavaScript for instance. Is there such a library From the other questions I see have been asked here over the last couple of years, I think the answer is no, but I thought Id better check to be sure. p  pThanksp

Negative 27758 pMy db keeps the top 10 records.  When the db is empty, the db records the scores and inserts them correctly all the way until there is 10 records.  Then, for example, when the db has 10 scores, and the user gets a score that should be the new 1 score, it just replaces the current 1 score with the new one instead of inserting and bumping everything below it down one and deleting the bottom score.  Hopefully I explained that well but if not just comment and I will try to clarify further.p  pMy question is how can I get the high scores to perform correctly as in when the high scores is full with 10 records already, a new record is inserted into the correct spot and the rest below it are all moved down one with the last record getting bumped off completely since it is the new 11.p  pstrongDatabaseHelper.javastrongp  precodepublic class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper        SQLiteDatabase db      private static final int DATABASEVERSION  6      private static final String DBNAME  test3      private static final String DBPATH  datadatamatt.lyons.bibletriviadatabases     private static final String TABLE  HighscoresList        Table columns names.      private static final String RANK  id      private static final String SCORE  score      private static final String PERCENTAGE  percentage     private static final String TOTALSCORE  totalscore     private static final String CATEGORY  category      Constructor for a DatabaseHelper.     public DatabaseHelperContext context           supercontext, DBNAME, null, DATABASEVERSION            Open the DB so it is editable.     public SQLiteDatabase openDB          db  this.getWritableDatabase         return db           Delete a selected one row.     public void deletelong lowScore          lowScore  getLowest         db.deleteTABLE, TOTALSCORE    lowScore, null           Sort rows in order of the TOTALSCORE column.     public long getLowest          Cursor c  db.rawQuerySELECT  FROM   TABLE   ORDER BY   TOTALSCORE, null         long count  c.getCount         long lowScore  1         ifcount  10              c.moveToLast             lowScore  c.getIntc.getColumnIndexTOTALSCORE                  return lowScore           Calculate the TOTALSCORE based on the SCORE and PERCENTAGE of a game.     public long calculateTotalScorelong score, int percentage          long i         return i  percentage  1000  score           Check if new record makes the top 10.     public long checklong score, int percentage, long sum          Cursor c  db.rawQuerySELECT   TOTALSCORE   FROM   TABLE, null         long count  c.getCount         long lowscore         ifcount  10              c.moveToLast             lowscore  c.getIntc.getColumnIndexTOTALSCORE             return lowscore          else              return count                    Insert new record.     public long insertlong score, int percentage, long totalscore, String category          ContentValues values  new ContentValues         values.putSCORE, score         values.putPERCENTAGE, percentage         values.putTOTALSCORE, totalscore         values.putCATEGORY, category          return db.insertTABLE, null, values           Create the table and all columns.     public void onCreateSQLiteDatabase db          db.execSQLCREATE TABLE   TABLE                     RANK   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,                  SCORE   LONG,                  PERCENTAGE   INTEGER,                  CATEGORY   STRING,                  TOTALSCORE   LONG                         codepre  pstrongResults.javastrongp  precodepublic class Results extends Activity       DatabaseHelper dh      public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState           dh  new DatabaseHelperthis         dh.openDB         showResults           public void showResults           totalscore  dh.calculateTotalScorescore, percentage         ifdh.getLowest  1              dh.insertscore, percentage, totalscore, category          else              dh.deletedh.getLowest             dh.insertscore, percentage, totalscore, category                codepre

Negative 27758 pI am trying to pull a random sample of a population from a Peoplesoft Database. The searches online have lead me to think that the Sample Clause of the select statement may be a viable option for us to use, however I am having trouble understanding how the Sample clause determines the number of samples returned. I have looked at the oracle documentation found here a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE1188201server.112e26088statements10002.htmi2065953 relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE1188201server.112e26088statements10002.htmi2065953ap  pBut the above reference only talks about the syntax used to create the sample. The reason for my question is I need to understand how the sample percent determines the sample size returned. It seems like it applies a random number to the percent you ask for and then uses a seed number to count every n records. Our requirement is that we pull an exact number of samples for example, that they are randomly selected, and that they are representative of the entire table or at least the grouping of data we choose with filtersp  pIn a population of 10200 items if I need a sample of approximately 100 items, I could use this statementp  precodeSELECT  FROM PSLEDGER SAMPLE1 1  of my total population WHERE DEPTID  700064  codepre  pHowever, We need to pull an exact number of samples in this case 100 so I could pick a sample size that almost always returns more than the number I need then trim it down IEp  precodeSELECT Count FROM PSLEDGER SAMPLE2.5 this percent must always give gt 100 items WHERE DEPTID  700064 and rownum lt 101 codepre  pMy concern with doing that, is that my sample would not uniformly represent the entire population. For example if the sample function just pulls every N record after it creates its own randomly generated seed, then choosing the rownum lt 101 will cut off all of the records chosen from the bottom of the table. What I am looking for is a way to pull out exactly 100 records from the table, which are randomly selected and fairly representative of the entire table. Please helpp

Negative 27758 pI am really struggling with an Eclipse project where Tomcat is giving me timeout.

Negative 27758 pI have a generic turnbased game Im working on and currently here is how it operates Using boneCP connection pool, MySQL database, java server, android client, and soon a threadpool.p  pClient makes request to server. Java serverspawns a new thread to process request. Server sends response. TCP socket terminates.p  pRather than maintaining loads of persistent long lasting connections each client simple pokes the server every x interval and asks if it is their turn yet. If no, it does nothing. If yes it can input and send its move to the server.p  pWith this type of serverprodding networking, might I find some benefit in converting everything to NIO The clients typically only send very small pieces of data, a few lines of text over TCP socket. The server could rarely and occasionally be sending larger files to clients images, sound, video. Any other thoughts on using IONIO for this application I wonder if this might expand my scalability by removing a bottleneck at max  of threads created, even if they do only last a second or so.p  pEdit Also note if player A waits more than 3060 seconds to make their turn, then their turn is forfeit. So its not as if Im poking server in an infinite loop potentially forever. At best it would be intervals of 5 seconds a few times.

Negative 27758 pIn the comments of a recent question I posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17309912cbadformtocallbaseclassasssignmentoperatorinderivedclassconstructC Bad Form to Call Base Class Asssignment Operator in Derived Class Constructora I ran into another issue with regards to how I use staticcast to go from a derived type to a base type.  Supporting documenation for the issue can be found here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9084835whydoesstaticcastthistoabaseclasscreateatemporarycopyWhy does staticcastthis to a base class create a temporary copya.p  pMy main problem is that Im now having no issue using staticcast to cast this to the base class inside my derived class.  However, I cannot perform a static cast from a derived reference to a base reference.  I only do this in my equality operator of the derived class.  Heres the issuep  precodebool Derivedoperatorconst Derivedamp otherderived     first call the operator  from the base class...   if staticcastltBaseampgtthis  staticcastltBaseampgtotherderived       continue checks for derived member variables     codepre  pThe compiler yells at the if statement above.  It has no problem with the staticcast of this, but cannot interpret the staticcast from the derived class to the base class.  If I remove the reference, this compiles fine, but as shown in the two referenced questions, this will unnecessarily create a temporary object.p  pAs a result, Im wondering if perhaps Im missing a constructor to go from a derived class to a base class.  Where would I write such a constructor since it is a constructor for the base type  I dont think that it would make sense to do so within the bases source code since doesnt that essentially make the base class custom and ruin the spirit of reusable codep  pAn easier alternative would be to just accept the temporary creation of the object within this function, but the function may end up freqeuently called, and therefore Im not sure if I can accept the performance hit.p  pIs there anything else that Im missing of that I should consider  As always, thanks in advance for the help.p

Negative 27758 pIm trying to implement MVC in Qt using a data model ported from another platform. I have several widgets onscreen that each listen to the same model to render the data. The user can also interact with these widgets, edit them, and thus push changes back into the model. p  pThe specific problem I have is that if my ported data model changes and I push data into eg a QTreeWidgetItem with setData, the widget emits an itemChanged signal.  This in turn triggers the controller code that is monitoring user edits, and causes it to push the same data back to the model. Unless I insert data comparison somewhere, I end up with an infinite loop. p  pIs there some way for the controller to quietly update the items data without emitting itemChanged Alternately, is there a better way to distinguish between user edits on a widget and programmatic changes  I am simply listening for itemChanged. p

Negative 27758 pThe short description of the functionality that we are trying to achieve  we have a list of source objects on the left, a person can drag new items from the list to a list on the right, items thus get added to the list on the right they can also remove items from the list on the right.  The list on the right then gets saved whenever it is changed.  I dont think the specifics of howwhere it is being saved matter...p  pI am having a problem with a bit of timing in the JavaScript vs. DOM elements realm of things.  Items that are already on the list on the right can be removed.  We have some code that fires on a removedelete type iconbutton on a DOM element, that is supposed to remove the element from the DOM visually and permanently i.e. it doesnt need to be brought back with a show.  This visual change should then also show up in the JSON object that is built when the JS traverses the DOM tree to build the new updated list.p  pHowever, this chunk of JS code that runs immediately after this .remove is called, the element that should have just been removed still shows up in the JSON object.  This is not good.p  pHere are what I believe to be the relevant bits of code operating here.  This lives in a web browser much of this is in the document.ready function.  A given list can also have subsections, hence the sublist parts and loops.p  pThe onclick definitionp  precodebody.onclick, .removeLine, function  var parentthis.parent.parent.parent     The button is a few DIVs shy of the outer container var Listthis.closestarticle     Another parent object, containing all the  parent.fadeOut 300,      function          parent.slideUp300         parent.remove        sendListList      This builds and stores the list based on the DOM elements  codepre  pAnd then later on, this function definitionp  precodefunction sendListList  var ListArray[],      subListArray[],      itemsArray  [],      subListName   var ListTitle  encodeTextList.find.title.html               loop through the subLists List.find.subList.each         functionindex, element              subListNamethis.findheader gt .title.html   Get sublist Title             subListIDthis.attrid                Get subList ID               loop through the line items             itemsArray[]             this.find.itemSearchResult.each                 functionindex, element                                Build item Array                     if this.attrdataitemid item                           itemArray.push this.attrdataitemid                                                                   Build SubList Array with items Array             subListArray.push                                              subListName subListName,                         subListID  subListID,                         items  itemsArray                                             lt end SubList Loop gt   Complete List Array with subListArray ListArray  ListName ListTitle, ListID List.attrid, subLists subListArray           Send New List to DataLists Object  the local version of storage updateDataListsListArray          Update remote storage window.location URLstring  ampTypeList  ampJSON  JSON.stringifyListArray  ampobjectID  ListArray.ListID   codepre  pIt seems to be the interaction of the parent.remove step and then the call to sendList that get their wires crossed.  Visually, the object on screen looks right, but if we check the data being sent to the storage, it comes through WITH the object that was visually removed.p  pThanks, Jp  pPS.  As you can probably tell, we are new at the Javascript thing, so our code may not be terribly efficient or proper.  But...it works  Well, except for this issue.  And we have run into this issue a few times.  We have a workaround for it, but I would rather understand what is going on here.  Learn the deeper workings of JS so we dont create these problems in the first place.p

Negative 27758 pI have two view controllers. View controller A has a codeUIScrollViewcode and presents view controller B. The presentation is interactive and controlled by the codescrollView.contentOffsetcode.p  pI want to integrate an interactive dismiss transition When panning up, ViewController B should be dismissed interactively. The interactive dismiss transition should also control the ViewController A scrollView.p  pMy first attempt was using a codeUIPanGestureRecognizercode and setting the codescrollView.contentOffsetcode according to the panned distance. This works, however when the pan gesture is ended, the scrollView offset has to be animated to the end position. Using code[UIScrollView setContentOffsetanimatedcode is not a good solution since it uses a linear animation, doesnt take the current pan velocity into account and doesnt decelerate nicely.p  pSo I thought it should be possible to feed the touch events from my pan gesture recognizer into the scroll view. This should give us all the nice scroll view animation behavior.p  pI tried overriding the codetouchesBeganMovedEndedCancelled withEventcode methods in my codeUIPanGestureRecognizercode subclass like thisp  precode voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      [scrollView touchesBegantouches withEventevent]     [scrollView.panGestureRecognizer touchesBegantouches withEventevent]      [super touchesBegantouches withEventevent]  codepre  pBut apparently something is blocking the scroll view from entering codetrackingcode mode. It does go to codedragging  YEScode but thats about it. I verified the scrollView is codeuserInteractionEnabledcode, not hidden and added to the view hierarchy.p  pSo how can I forward my touch events to codeUIScrollViewcodep
Negative 27758 pFor whatever reason I am really beating myself up with this...  No doubt because of the lack of support for a real proper way of vertically centering anything.p  h2The Goalh2  pIs to have a set of four images, each inside their own responsive columns.  Each image has a white overlay, that when hovered reveals more of the image, as well as a title for each of the 4 images that is horizontally and vertically centered inside the image.p  pI could easily achieve this if I set specific widthheights and stuck the image inside CSS rather than the HTML. For SEO reasons I want the image to be present in the HTML. p  pAdditionally because of the responsive nature, the images must scale to 100 of the width of the column they reside in.  Consequently, because the width scales, the height scales as well.p  pSo the first issue is getting the caption as I am calling it in my classes, to appear over the top of the image.  Easily done with a simple codeposition absolutecode as well as codetop 0code and codeleft 0code on the caption and codeposition relativecode on the container.p  pThe big problem and second issue, is vertically centering the Gallery 1 text over the top of the image.  I have to use the codeposition absolutecode bit as I mentioned above just to get the text overtop of the image.  From there I cant manage to get a codedisplay tablecode solution to work, nor a 50 margin solution to work.p  pHere is a stronga hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzh4G6 relnofollowJS Fiddleastrongp  pMy strongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltimg srchttplorempixel.comoutputcityqc6404808.jpg gt     ltdiv classcaptiongt         lta hrefgtGallery 1ltagt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAny ideas on how to achieve this  I would like to stay at least IE8 supported, and I am using selectivizr already, so pseudoclasses dont bother me.p

Negative 27758 pI have a C program which creates a List of Bitmaps from the images in a directory. Itll use the whole list of Bitmaps to generate one new image, which it will then save. When the user loads a new directory to repeat the process, the List of Bitmaps is cleared and refilled. The bitmaps are loaded upon creation of the object, new Bitmappath.p  pI had a problem which occurred when the user performed the following steps p  ol liLoad images from directory 1li liChose not to save and instead load images from directory 2li liTries to save by overwriting an image from directory 1li liProgram is unable to save due to A generic error in GDI, because it is still using the image that is being overwritten.li ol  pThe original List of Bitmaps loaded from directory 1 is indeed cleared and then refilled with images from directory 2. However, Bitmap.Save refuses to overwrite an image it had previously loaded emunlessem I call System.GC.Collect after I perform Clear.p  pIm pretty sure the problem has something to do with keeping the Bitmaps around even though there are no references, otherwise why would garbage collecting solve the problem Is this the right way to go about solving this problem, or is there a proper way to dispose of Bitmaps in C Thanks.p
Negative 27758 pAgain me. Sorry for possibly stupid questions but Im new to this so i Have this  initial problems and dilemas.p  pI would like to optimize carbon emission using dymola optimization library on this theoretical case. There is grid and PV as means of supply and there is demand. If grid is used, it emits some carbon. Therefore PV should be always used. But sometimes there isnt enough of PV so grid has to be used. The ammount of grid and PV usage is controled by variables x1 and x2 which should be contrained from 0 to 1 as means of percentage. If I run the following code, it says too many variables. If I set x1 as parameter with value 1, it runs but then optimization cannot be carried out because even though I set in the optimization setting that x1 can change from 0 to 1, it cannot change it because of the code. p  pWhat can I do to run this I would like to optimize emission variable which is dependent on x1 and x2. Constraints for variables x1 and x2 should be 0ltx1lt1, 0ltx2lt1. There is one equation missing for x1 and x2. But x1  x2 doesnt need to be 0 because solarThermal.y and electricity arent equal. So is there a way from optimization to vary 2 variable in order to minimize 3rd variable I can set x1 to 1 as parameter so that the code can be compiled and then I would like the optimization to varry both x1 and x2. Is it possiblep  pThank you in advancep  precodemodel konacno parameter Real electricity999 Real x2start0 Real x1 Real emissionsstart0 Modelica.Blocks.Sources.TimeTable solarThermaltable   [0,3003590,2953600,2007195,2017200,30010795,29910800,200] Modelica.Blocks.Sources.TimeTable heatDemandtable  [0,3003590,2953600,2507195,2517200,30010800,300] equation  0x2electricityx1solarThermal.y  heatDemand.y deremissions0.13x2electricity end konacno codepre

There are actually a lot more coins in the JSON string that I removed for demonstration purposes and creating a class for each coin would be insane, let alone iterating would be nearly impossible, there must be some other way that I still dont know about, maybe a dictionaryp  pHere are the generated classes p  precodepublic class Sellorder      public string price  get set      public string quantity  get set      public string total  get set    public class Buyorder      public string price  get set      public string quantity  get set      public string total  get set    public class ASC      public string marketid  get set      public string label  get set      public string primaryname  get set      public string primarycode  get set      public string secondaryname  get set      public string secondarycode  get set      public ListltSellordergt sellorders  get set      public ListltBuyordergt buyorders  get set    public class Sellorder2      public string price  get set      public string quantity  get set      public string total  get set    public class Buyorder2      public string price  get set      public string quantity  get set      public string total  get set    public class CENT      public string marketid  get set      public string label  get set      public string primaryname  get set      public string primarycode  get set      public string secondaryname  get set      public string secondarycode  get set      public ListltSellorder2gt sellorders  get set      public ListltBuyorder2gt buyorders  get set    public class Return      public ASC ASC  get set      public CENT CENT  get set    public class RootObject      public int success  get set      public Return return  get set   codepre  pWhat I want to do here is get rid of Sellorder2 and Buyorder2.

Negative 27758 pConsider the following codep  precodemodule classes Type AData end Type  Type A contains procedure  Work end type  Type, extendsAData  BData end Type  Type, extendsA  B contains procedure  Work gt Work2 end type  contains  subroutine Workthis, D classA  this class  D end subroutine  subroutine Work2this, D classB  this classBData  D end subroutine  end module classes codepre  pIs this valid It is accepted by ifort and rejected by gfortran because of the nonidentical classes in the second argument of Work2.p  pIf it is not valid, it seems clearly useful in some instances with more arguments of different types, descendant procedures would have to have multiple nested select type statements to convert the arguments to the expected type. This would be horribly verbose and presumably also less efficient if it is known at compile time what types the arguments will have in the descendant classes at the expense of losing some compiletime consistency checks. Is there a compiler option to make gfortran accept this construct, or should it be a gcc bug reportfeature requestp  pEdit  To be explicit, Gfortran 4.9 trunk gives Error Argument mismatch for the overriding procedure work at 1 Type mismatch in argument d CLASSbdataCLASSp  pifort but not gfortran also allows constructs such asp  precodesubroutine Work2this, D classB  this class, target  D classBData, pointer  B  BgtD      end subroutine codepre  pand thus appears to treat classstar variables as having a trust me, I know what type it is tag from the developer. To me this seems very reasonable if used sparingly, and avoids overheads in select type operations and sometimes very longwinded multiple nested select type statements. The only other valid way to do blind type casting I know is to push things though an external subroutine where there is no type checking on arguments at all the emhorribleem way for getting round passing aribitrary type arguments in f90.p  pThe desire to override classstar procedures with other types also arises in basic contexts like minimization libraries where you want to pass in a function and an arbitrary object. Here the developer and specific function implementation always know what type the object is even if the minimizer does not, and so you dont want to have to do a select type in your implementation of the function with a class argument.p

Additionally, you may need to specify some parametersp  precodeyourflipperid.flipper      width  500,ltspan classAppletabspan stylewhitespacepregt ltspangt The total width of the widget.      height  250,ltspan classAppletabspan stylewhitespacepregt ltspangt The total height of the widget.   codepre  pSo my question is, where do I call this script within my html file Do I need to define the yourflipperid name somewherep  pThanks Jp

I keep my SDK always updated so I frequently Run the SDK manager and download all the updates. recently I noticed that if I create a new android app project it is not creating a default MainActivity even if I check that box, it does not create a Activity under src and more to annoy me, I wasnt able to refactor anything, so I realized that I had to update my Eclipse as after reading few posts, but now when I create every new project it creates an annoying appcompatv7 project with EVERY  project, say I create two new projects it creates appcompatv72....this is driving me crazy and the new project library is the appcompatv7 project. This is becoming annoying and no idea whats going on here  What should I do...please rescue me  Thanks in advance ....A screenshot to annoy u guys too ...  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsOPZq.png altToday is not my dayp  pCurrent Alternative, not a solutionp  pstrongAs of 1252014 with ADT 23.0.2 I dont see this issue anymore.strongp  pI have waited for an acceptable solution on this issue as of now there is none, but one of the SO members directed me to this post a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid66975 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid66975a. What I am doing is described in one of the solutions below, but for people who have come to this post, the alternative is to delete that ugly projectif you have more than one which has been created and add up this oneappcompatv7 as a library. So if you create another project and appcomatv72...comes up delete that and point your project to the appcompatv7, do the same for other projects too. This is not recommended for some reason though, but it worked well for me till now without issues. If anyone hits up with a solution please post it here. Current Alternative, not a solutionp

Negative 27758 pIve the need to run one Perl cgi as root. I already understand most of the security concerns of doing this but let me explain first.p  pThe Perl cgi could run as the web server but would require sudo access to run some commands. This is what Ive done first but this doesnt only allow that cgi to run these commands but the whole user running the web server. Also, instead of running commands with sudo, I would prefer to use native library that are way faster than running external commands. However, these native library requires root access for some of the operations.p  pSo what I had in mind was to run this one single cgi as root havent really found how yet, this my main issue right now. The first thing I would do in the Perl cgi would be to change the effective uid   gid  to a nonprivileged user and only change it back to root when I need to call one of the native library requiring root access, then change it back to the nonprivileged users.p  pSo far, do you have any comments on this ideap  pBack to the main question how can I allow that cgi to run as root Ive taken a look at suexec but it doesnt seem to allow root Cant use setuid on a Perl script looking for some helpideas herep  pBest regards,p  pYannick Bergeronp

Negative 27758 pI have inherited a Microsoft Access 2010 database that is used to keep positionemployee information in a single table.  The table has an autonumber field for each record.  The database has a form  ScreenB  that uses a query to pull and display in ScreenB a single record based on search criteria Personnel Number, Last Name, Social Security Number, etc. entered by the user.  The record contains approximately 25 fields that show the information about the position as well as information about the person in the position.  Of course, every so often a person will leave a position and someone else will be hired into the vacated position.  My users would like a button on ScreenB that will, when clickedp  ol liCopy the record information displayed in the form for just the 12 or so fields of position information being displayed on ScreenB.li liPaste the information as a new record in the table.li liDisplay the new record with the pasted information in the form.li ol  pSince the query pulls a single record, my thought was to create a new form  ScreenC  identical in all respects to ScreenB to display the new record.  So, the button will copy the position information from the record displayed on ScreenB, paste it as a new record into the table, open ScreenC, jump to the end of the records in the table and display the new last record which contains only the position information on ScreenC, and close ScreenB, leaving the user with the position information only and a form that can be filled out with the employee information.  This will preserve the information of the previous employee while in that position, which is required.p  pIm not a trained programmer, so the code below is probably rife with errors, but it was the best I could come up withp  precodeDim strSQL as String strSQL  INSERT INTO [tblNewCurrent Emp] numCostCenter, numPosition, txtTitles, txtClassCode. numGrade, txtPositionType, txtUnit1, txtFieldStaff, txtFedMatch, txtPositionLicReq, txtPositionOrigin, datPosAcquired, datPosLastVacated, datPosTransferred, txtOrigTitle, txtOrigClassCode, numOrigGrade, datPosReclassified  strSQL  strSQL amp SELECT numCostCenter, numPosition, txtTitles, txtClassCode. numGrade, txtPositionType, txtUnit1, txtFieldStaff, txtFedMatch, txtPositionLicReq, txtPositionOrigin, datPosAcquired, datPosLastVacated, datPosTransferred, txtOrigTitle, txtOrigClassCode, numOrigGrade, datPosReclassified from [tblNewCurrent Emp]  strSQL  strSQL amp WHERE numSystemNumber   amp Me.numSystemNumber amp  DoCmd.RunSQL strSQL DoCmd.OpenForm frmScreenC DoCmd.GoToRecord , , acLast DoCmd.Close frmScreenB codepre  pThe table is named tblNewCurrent Emp, which is why I placed it in brackets.  numSystemNumber is the name of the autonumber field.  All forms, queries and tables are in a single databasefile.  The field names in the code above are the actual names of the fields.p  pWhen I attempt to run the code, I get an error message that states, Syntax error in INSERT INTO statement.  No other information, and no information in the Access Help system.  I tried removing the brackets from the table name, and get the same error message.  I would appreciate any input, thoughts, or suggestions. What is the error with the INSERT INTO statement  Is there another way to accomplish this task  Unfortunately, I cant make structural changes to the database and since it is the backend for a number of other databases, changing the table name is not an option, either.  Users access the database through the forms only.  No datasheet or other views.  Thanks.p  pstrongEDITstrong Thank you billmac1 and Remou.  The strong...,txtClassCode. numGrade,...strong was the issue on the SQL.  Once I corrected that, I used your suggestion to run the code in the Immediate Windows with the print.debug as well.

Negative 27758 pI am using the JQuery UI accordion plugin to show and hide blocks of text.  This works fine.  However, I was wondering how I could show some of the text under the header so that my users can get an idea of what is there rather than having to open each one and look  For instance, it would be nice to show the first two codeltpgtcode tags then allow them to click to see the rest.p  pI have seen this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19585586creatingacustomaccordioneffectwithpreviewoftextanswera but it works with a custom accordion and not the JQuery UI one which I would rather use.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 27758 pI am currently creating a new TumblrTheme for the blog of a friend of mine. The new theme includes stuff like inifinite scrolling and should arrange the posts in a grid depending on the length of the content of the post. I am using a responsive design, which basically distinguishes 2 sizesp  ul liThe 1st is for very small widths of browser windows e.g. smartphones, but also on desktops. In this case the posts should be ordered below each other in one column and use the whole screen width.li liThe 2nd handles higher widths of browser windows e.g. desktops. Here the posts are floating and ordered in multiple columns which is working as expected.li ul  pHowever, I now ran into a problem that I couldnt solve When I resize the browser window to be quite thin, the posts are ordered below each other in one column which is the expected behaviour. If I now resize a bit it to be even thinner, the width of the post container do adapt, but the positions of the posts do not. This leads to the point where the single posts overlap each other and there are no margins in between anymore. However, if you refresh the page at this point, the issue does resolve and the result looks like it should look posts are fully visible, margins between the posts are OK.p  pSo my question is how do I have to change the theme to get the expected result without refreshing the whole pagep  pTo prevent misunderstandings of my problem, you can see the result of the theme in a test blog under a hrefhttptraintes.tumblr.com relnofollowhttptraintes.tumblr.coma. Because I dont know if it is helpful to provide the full Tumblr theme which is approx. 800 rows of code long, I am subsequently providing only the base scheme here. If I should provide any further information or even the full theme, please dont hesitate to contact me. Any help to resolve this issue would be appreciatedp  pEDIT Just to make it sure, I have already searched here and searched with Google.

Now lets assume I cannot change the code in those actions the code that produces the model to be updated. Can I still somehow prevent certain columns from updating from within the update method. Note that I might want to set those columns using linq to SQL, but only during insert method.p  pIm quite sure Im trying something unconventional here, but it might help me write some easy to reuse code. If it cannot be done, then Ill solve it differently, but it never hurts to try something new.p

Negative 27758 pIm trying to make a program that is similar to a Type To Learn program and eventually develop it into an app. Im aware that its really easy to just have a button that checks whether the user input is equal to the prompted word by doing something like ifuserInput.equalspromptedWord, but I want to have it similar to Quizlet in that the moment the user has the right answer typed up, the program marks it correct and moves on to the next word if you get what i mean. Basically, there should be no enter button. Instead, the moment the user types in the right word, the program realizes it and marks it right and moves on. Im really puzzled on how to approach it this way though. Ive been trying to research ways in which I can access the users input the moment hes typing it in but I cant really find anything about it. Is there anyway I can do this, or is it extremely difficult to dop  pThanks, and let me know if I should try to add more informationp
Negative 27758 pI have a problem when i am trying to use my chromecast device. Currently I have an app for Android , one for iOS and these 2 apps from github.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comgooglecastMediaRouterCastButtonandroid relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgooglecastMediaRouterCastButtonandroidap  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comgooglecastCastVideosandroid relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgooglecastCastVideosandroidap  pAll of them have a common problem. They sometimes cannot accuratelly tell if a chromecast device is connected or disconnected.Taking around a minute before they find it out themselfs.While an application like Youtube , discovers if it is connected or not, instantly.p  pEDIT 1 STARTp  pWhile using the application Cast Videos for android from GitHub the following thing happens. I hold the android device in my hand Samsung Galaxy S2.  I know chromecast is on because I can see it on my monitor. I start the application Cast Videos. The Chromecast icon does not appear, even if the chromecast device is on.p  pEDIT 1 ENDp  pI have tried using the appid from my own receiver application , and the default receiver appid. p  pI have found a way to trick them into finding the device. By launching the youtube application on an Android or iOS device , connect to the chromecast device , then disconnect.p  pWhen I return to on off the apps I have mentioned at the start of the question , they can detect it now , and connect to it.p  pThe two applications from github are not modified , and use the most up to date support libraries appcompat, mediarouter, CCL.p  pThe applications are now being currently build on a Mac if that matters. I dont think it will be of any difference if they were built on Windows or something else.p  pEDIT 2 I am starting to suspect that actually the wifi router in the building im programming may cause these connection problems. Because when I send the app to other people they dont have the same problem.p  pEDIT 3 Good news D. The latest update on the castcompanionlibrary made chromecast detection much more reliable and the sample now detects preciselly every time if it is connected or not.p

Negative 27758 pFirst, the motivationp  pIm building an app that could benefit from, but does not absolutely require, Android services obtained via the codeAccountManagercode. That being the case, Ive built my app without the codeGETACCOUNTScode and codeUSECREDENTIALScode permissions, opting instead to build a codeServicecode plugin for authorization, which the user can optionally install. Now, this plugin works entirely as intended except for one glaring issue I can start the codeIntentcode returned from codegetAuthToken...code that asks for initial authorization, but I cannot wait for it to complete.p  pSo, now that it is known why I want to call codegetAuthToken...code from a codeServicecode instead of an codeActivitycode, does anyone know how I can wait for the authorization codeIntentcode to complete before returning a token Basically, in the code below, does anyone know how to hold off on returning codetokencode until codeauthIntentcode completesp  precode... AccountManagerFutureltBundlegt accountManagerFuture accountManagerFuture  accountManager.getAuthTokenaccounts[0], android, true, null, null Bundle authTokenBundle  accountManagerFuture.getResult if authTokenBundle.containsKeyAccountManager.KEYAUTHTOKEN     token  authTokenBundle.getStringAccountManager.KEYAUTHTOKEN.toString else if authTokenBundle.containsKeyAccountManager.KEYINTENT      Intent authIntent  Intent authTokenBundle.getParcelableAccountManager.KEYINTENT     authIntent.addFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK     context.startActivityauthIntent     ...      I know that I wouldnt set token here this is just to emphasize      that I want to set it after authIntent completes     token    codepre  pAlso, if its of any use to know, the code above is located within an codeAsyncTaskcode. Itd be ugly, but maybe I could poll codegetAuthToken...code until it no longer returns an codeIntentcode I have to believe theres a better solution than that, though.p

Negative 27758 pIm writing a program using Intel AVX2 instructions. I found a bug in my program which appears only with optimization level O2 or higher With O1 its good. After extensive debugging, I narrow down the buggy region. Now the bug seems to be caused by the compiler incorrect optimizing out a simple copy assignment of strongm256istrong variable.p  pConsider the following code snippet. Foo is a templated function. I test with codeCMP  kLess, OPTkSetcode. Im aware that the optimizer will probably optimize out the switches. It may even optimize out the variable codeycode. p  pThe buggy line is codey  mltcode. When compiled with O2, strongthis line seems to be ignoredstrong. Then codeycode doesnt get the right value and the program generates wrong result. However the program is correct with O1.p  pTo verify my judgement, I replace codey  mltcode with two alternativesp  pcodey  avxormlt, avxzerocode takes bitwise OR of codemltcode and an all0s vectorp  pcodey  mm256loadsi256ampmltcode use the SIMD load instruction to load data from the address of codemltcode.p  pBoth should be semantically equivalent to codey  mltcode My intention is to prevent some optimization by adding some functions. The program works correctly with these two replacements under all optimization levels. So the problem is weird. To my knowledge, direct assignment of SIMD variables is definitely okay I used a lot before.

This works only on tab with suggested or simmilar products, then when i click on add to cart in listed simmilar products it adds to cart over ajax. I noticed class changes so i made loading bar and stuff according to them. But it just wont work on archive page S  Any ideas p  pSecond problem is, i have p  precode                           woocommercebeforeshoploop hook                             hooked woocommerceresultcount  20               hooked woocommercecatalogordering  30                           doaction woocommercebeforeshoploop  codepre  pin archiveproduct.php and that i assume calls catalog ordering. And catalog ordering appears on page but nothing works when selecting options. Its just like inactive select box and thats it. This is my second issue. Im trying to solve this for two days without luck. Any help appriciated. Thanksp

Negative 27758 pI am beginning a completely new project that will be the foundation for a very large web service and in doing so I am reflecting on my last few Web API based projects and reconsidering some decisions I made. The last several projects includedp  ol lipHATEOS from the ground up, implemented through a set of enrichers that provided significant details about the resource being returned but added overhead and development time and have gone largely unused.pli lipVersioning through the accept header only i.e. applicationvnd.resourcev1json. This provided a lot of flexibility but the feedback from both test and end users was that it was heavy handed and difficult to work with.pli lipKVP authentication with always on SSL.pli ol  pWith this new project I set out to reevaluate those three topics versioning, authenticationauthorization and the needusefulness of HATEOS.p  pI already tossed HATEOS out the window and will reopen it if demand necessitates it. Authorization and Authentication are being covered by a dedicated auth server with some useful pointers from Taiseer Joudeh.p  pRecently I have been looking at Stripe for a different project and took a liking to how they versioned their API. It essentially boils down to two elements, the version in the URI as well as a custom header version date i.e. 12022014.p  pFor all intents and purposes the v1 in the URL could be considered a placeholder for Stripe and may never actually be used. I could argue the merits of both its inclusion and omission but for the sake of clarity and the possibility of the entire API eventually being updated in a nonbackwards compatible way, I like having it there. I liken this to a major build number.p  pAs for the custom date header version, I liken this to a minor build number. Stripe allows its users to continue operating at their current version of the API until one of two things occursp  ol lipThe user logs into the portal and they make the selection, after which all calls will be evaluated through that version.pli lipThe user sends in a header only necessary once on a call to set the header. pli ol  pI am not as much of a fan of 2 in that I would prefer it to be a specific call to the API to set the version much like the the manual task of going into the portal and making the change there and this would keep you from having to evaluate every request coming through the pipeline for the possibility of a new version being set.p  pOver all I am a fan of this concept. It allows every consumer of the API to operate at a specific version of the API, without the need to have to worry about URLs changing or the complexity of setting custom media types in the accept headers of every resource.p  pThe dropping of HATEOS as a requirement also allows me to use Attributed Routes, something I had to abandon after I came to a similar realization as Shawn Wildermuth in how limiting it is when trying to create rich metadata about the resources being returned.p  pSo now it comes to the implementation and ultimately my questionp  pHowp  pThere are quite a few ways to tackle this and each have their pros and cons.p  pFor starters I really like using a date for the version. It is clean from the users perspective however it is a lot less clean under the hood. That said, there is also something to be said about the confusion you introduce when you separate them.p  pstrongOPTION 1strongp  pemAPI versions 11052014 and 12022014, set by the customer via the portal or API call.emp  pemControllerresource names in the solution PeopleV1 and PeopleV2 V1  11052014, V2  12022014.emp  pemIn order to proceed down this route I will need to maintain a datasource, likely populated in cache, either in table storage, SQL or even a text file that contains these mappings.emp  pstrongOPTION 2strongp  pemAPI versions 11052014 and 12022014, set by the customer via the portal or API call.emp  pemControllerresource names in the solution PeopleV20141105 and PeopleV20141202. These are really confusing for the developer to implement but would eliminate the need for the the data source in OPTION 1.emp  pstrongOPTION 3strong p  pemAPI versions 11052014 and 12022014, set by the customer via the portal or API call.emp  pControllerresource names in the solution Instead of concentrating on the names, create folders in the solution for the resources i.e. 12022014 and in the controllersresources in the namespace use a custom attribute on the controller to declare its version. p  pemI have not investigated this one fully but it seems possible and even more important very clean.emp  pRegardless of which of the options above are selected, the other criteria that must be managed is the fallback of the controller selection.p  pUsing the example versions above, if the only breaking change in version 12022014 was on the VehicleController and the customer upgraded their API version to 12022014, the controller selector must be able to walk the proverbial version tree to find the most recent matching controller. So, in the example above, if the most recent PeopleController was 11052014 and the caller has an API version of 12022014 set, the latest PeopleController would be selected.p  pThis makes me lean towards OPTION 1 since it would be very easy to map 12022014 to 2 and attempt to retrieve PeopleV2 which does not exist and then walk it back to 11052014 V1.p  pMy concerns with this whole implementation is performance. The lookupfallback would be instantaneous, even if that means creating inmemory maps for the various API versions, stored in cache so that the walking of the tree occurs once and only once. p  pDoes anyone have an opinion on implementation Microsoft has a good sample project that implements VersionConstraints with attributed routes but this is less about constraints and more about controller selection including fallback and version mapping if necessary.p

Negative 27758 pIm using Mechanize to grab a bunch of pages behind links.  On page A, theres a bunch of companies that have a link called [complete profile], behind which is full html I want to grab.  There are 10 of these on page A.

Negative 27758 pI am working on a project where we are looking to build a REST API from scratch. So my initial thoughts were to utilise one of the relatively new aysnc nonblocking IO frameworks.p  pIve been looking at the Typesafe framework Scala, Akka, Play. Is this a good solution for a RESTful APIp  pAre there any good up to date tutorialsexamples that people could provide links top  pAlso, I came across spray.io. From what I can gather this seems to be a good alternative to using Play if all I want to build is a REASTful API Is that true Any good tutorials for thisp  pI would really like to use Akka and its Actors model from the outset.p  pSeparately I read that Typesafe acquired spray.io to integrate it into the Typesafe framework.

What would people suggest for hosting such an API with this type of framework AWS, Google, Cloud Foundry, Heroku The service will ultimately need to be extremely scalable.p  pDoes anyone know of any good links that cover a lot of the above i.e. deploying a spray based API on Cloud Foundry for examplep  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 27758 hr  pI am running Websockets on Jetty 9.2.7 with Cometd 3. p  pWhen the client browser starts, the sockets work fine for sometime and suddenly on some event they start to poll. Right after few minutes the clients start to poll, the server gets unresponsive.p  pHow can we prevent this This is literally killing my server.p  pWe get about 300,000 requests a day.  Here is the server configurationp  pminThreads  100, maxThreads  1500, acceptors default , idleTimeout 60000p  popen files can be 65535.p  pI enabled server dump but could not find much of a clue. It does not look like a problem with Load because the servers behavior is not consistent.p  pIf you look at the number of requests we were getting till 9.31, it was in 100s. The sudden spike in the number is because the clients started to poll. Its certain that the server will stop responding in some time.p  pWhat is interesting is, in the peak hours, the numbers look a lot different. The server starts to poll upon 3000 requests. p  pWe get some requests that are taking 18 seconds to complete. We get about 20,000 of them a day.Some requests take 5 seconds to complete and we get about 200,000 of such requests a day.  Could the requests with high latency be causing the problem Even if that does, The frequnecy oh high latency requests is way more compared to what is shown in the screenshot. But the server stands them for a really long time than what just happenedp  pWhat is the problem  The Code the server Server Configuration I am totally lost and we are considering to change the platform as the same code worked with no issues on jetty 8 a couple of months ago.

When I navigate to a static image file, code.htaccesscode drops me outside of my singlepage app, and the static file appears on screen. However, when I navigate back in my browser, I dont reenter my app URL changes, but there is no navigation, the image file remains on screen. No amount of popping or pushing state from there gets me back into my app.p  pIm not totally sure Im asking the right question here not sure this is about serving static files as much as it is about routing a singlepage app...I would be satisfied with any answer that allows page.js to pick back up on a codepopStatecode.p  pEDIT Im exempting files from my codeRewriteRulecode because I need to serve them in the pages rendered by my app. However, when a visitor clicks on an image in a rendered page, Id like the browser to simply display that image, with no markup.p

Negative 27758 pEach CPU instruction consumes a number of bytes. The smaller the size, the most instructions which can be held in the CPU cache.p  pstrongWhat techniques are available when writing C code which allow you to reduce CPU instruction sizesstrongp  pOne example could be reducing the number of FAR jumps literally, jumps to code across larger addresses. Because the offset is a smaller number, the type used is smaller and the overall instruction is smaller. p  pI thought GCCs builtinexpect may reduce jump instruction sizes by putting unlikely instructions further away.p  pI think I have seen somewhere that its better to use an int32t rather than int16t due to being the native CPU integer size and therefore more efficient CPU instructions.p  pOr is something which can only be done whilst writing assemblyp

Negative 27758 pThis one seems really common question in StackOverflow. However, I am having difficulty in validating these textarea Not to left blank and checkboxesAt least one should be checked. I tried several validation Javascripts and frameworks but in vain. p  pI have textarea named casetitle0[] whose will increase the number 0 to 1,2 and so on when user clicks Add More button. I want to validate at the point when user clicks the Add More button. p  pSecondly, I want the checkbox nameeditioncheckcaseNum[] which is dynamic as well to restrict user to leave it blank. The checkbox looks like editioncheck0[], editioncheck1[] and so on. It needs to be checked at least once to proceed to next Add More button. Until then Add More button should remain inactive.p  pSo, I want these two type of validation in my form ie. textarea and checkbox. p  pWhich is the simplest framework or custom code to use herep  pI dont want fancy display as just alert box should work in this regard.p

Negative 27758 pHello I built my application using angularjs and laravel. Personally, I use firefox for development and testing, so I did not notice this till it was brought to my attention. My application works only in firefox but not chrome or chrome based browsers, I am also unable to trace the source of the problem.  I have a button directive that when clicked on executes a function to post data to the server, now this works fine in firefox but not in chrome, you would think that an issue like cross browser compatibility not working would have something to do with client side code but my application throws a 500 internal server error strongONLYstrong in chrome or chrome based browsers.p  pI tested the function by posting an alert inside and the function was indeed getting called. I then went to the server side and found the controller that processed the request, removed the code within the assigned function and simply just did a p  precodereturn hello codepre  pThat still did not work, kept getting the same error.

Negative 27758 pLet us say an Interface MyInterface is present in jar A. jar B implements the interface . Now if I have to use this interface I need to take a dependency on jar A and B . What is the best way to avoid this double dependency  The problem is if you are using gradle you need to specify a version for jar A and jar B. Updating at 2 places is tricky and half of the times I see one of them is updated but not the other. One way I am thinking is implement MyInterface2 on jarB and ask to modify the downstream consumers to use MyInterface2 they can declare dependency only on Jar B. But gradle will do the transitive dependency walk so that they can declare only one version. Any thoughtscomments p  precodegt Jar A lt  public interface MyInterface    public void doSoemthing    gt Jar B lt  public class Impl1 implements MyInterface     public void doSomething    codepre  pThe gradle file for Jar B will look something likep  precodecompilepackagejarAltVersiongt codepre  p Project 1 ltp  precodeMyInterface foo  new Impl1 codepre  pThe gradle file will look something like p  precodecompilepackagejarAltVersiongt  compilepackagejarBltVersiongt codepre  pThe problem I have is I want the gradle to pull in jarA from transitive dependency, but if it is not there I get an compilation error saying that it could not find MyInterface.

The root view controller starts, but I get no log messages on the console, and no breakpoints are called in the start of the App after attaching the debugger.p  pSo I must have missed some documentation on how to start the App after Apple Watch already has made calls, or possibly I have a problem with my CoreData database being initialised wrongly.p  pAny ideas on how to debug this would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 27758 pCould anyone point out why this code can cause deadlock It is a single producer, multiple consumer problem. The producer have 8 buffers. Here it has 4 consumers. Each consumer will have two buffers. When a buffer is filled, it flags it to be ready to consume and switch to the second buffer. The consumer then can process this buffer. After it done, it return the buffer to the producer.p  pBuffer 01 for consumer 0 Buffer 23 for consumer 1 Buffer 45 for consumer 2 Buffer 67 for consumer 3p  pThe program once a while reaches to a dead lock state. The understanding is that, since the flag can be only in one state, either 0 or 1, so at least either consumer or producer can proceed.

And the most image heavy part of my application, which consists of about 50 thumbnails, loads just fine as well.p  pHowever, upon archiving the app and either uploading it to TestFlight or extracting as an AdHoc IPA, the same thing happens on the first initial launch of the app, it loads the launch screen for a few moments, and then crashes. Upon loading it a second time, the app will load up just fine, however that heavy party of my application with the 50 thumbnails, some of the images will be missing.p  pNow at first, I didnt know what to make of it. However, upon the second and third versions, I noticed that, depending on how long it took to crash, the more thumbnails would show up. For example if it loaded the launch screen for 30 seconds before crashing, it would show 22 of the 50 thumbnails. If it loaded for 45 seconds before crashing, it would show 26 of the thumbnails.p  pIm really stumped here guys, any help whatsoever would be phenomenal.p  pThanks.p

Negative 27758 pWe are using Breeze with Entity Framework 6.  To isolate our tenants, we are using the EF interceptors almost exactly like this post suggests a hrefhttpxabikos.commultitenantapplication20designsoftware20as20a20service20141117createamultitenantapplicationwithentityframeworkcodefirstpart1.html relnofollowhttpxabikos.commultitenantapplication20designsoftware20as20a20service20141117createamultitenantapplicationwithentityframeworkcodefirstpart1.htmla.  So when a new entity is created, the OrganizationId is populated on the server through a IDbCommandTreeInterceptor.  But were finding that when the data is updated, Breeze does not return the updated data in SaveResult, even though the value is correctly set in the database.  Here is a subset of the JSON that comes back captured via Fiddler.p  precode    id1,    typeBreeze.ContextProvider.SaveResult, Breeze.ContextProvider,    Entities[                 id2,          typeCe.Business.Contacts.ContactEntity, Ce.Business,          ContactId32,          EventIda1dcac144332e51182695cc5d46d497f,          Eventnull,          FirstNameTest,          LastNameUser1,          WebsiteUrlnull,          OrganizationId00000000000000000000000000000000           ],    KeyMappings[                 id12,          typeBreeze.ContextProvider.KeyMapping, Breeze.ContextProvider,          EntityTypeNameCe.Business.Contacts.ContactEntity,          TempValue1,          RealValue32           ],    Errorsnull  codepre  pYou can see that the OrganizationId is an empty GUID, even though it is set correctly on the server.  Is there something we need to do to have Breeze return the value that the interceptor changed  I would have expected that Breeze would return the value from the database and not the value it thinks it will be.p

Negative 27758 pNew to iOS development and trying to develop my app with correct practices. My main issue is trying to figure out the best way to store a bunch of simple data globally.p  pThe app connects to a computer adhoc wifi and gathers information about the current state. ex gpu temp, computer name, display resolution, datetime, etc. The various view controllers I have then allow the user to adjust some of these settings so I want to be able to keep track of these changes across all view controllers. p  pI have been wrestling between using a plist, core data, or singleton class to store all the information. Since the user will be connected to one computer for the life of the app I am leaning towards singleton since it seems easiest to get and set data. However, I have read that using a singleton is really not the best practice for various reasons. I have read up on plists and core data a little and seems like a decent amount of work just to get and set values. Should I spend the time using those or would some other method be a better way to accomplish all of this. p  pstrongUpdatestrong After both answers from Aaoli and Swift Rabbit. I wanted to clarify for my use case that the data I am storing did not need to be saved when the app was closed. So if you are coming to this question and need to store your data even if the app closes look at SwiftRabbits answer.p

Negative 27758 pI am currently backtesting a strategy which involves an codelmcode regression and a probit codeglmcode regression. I have a dataframe named codeforBacktestcode with 200 rows 1 for each day to backtest and 9 columns  the first 8 codex1code to codex8code are the explanatory variables and the last one codex9code is the real value which I am trying to explain in the regression. To do the regression, I have an other dataframe named codetempcode which has like 1000 rows one for each day and a lot of columns, some of which are the codex1code to codex8code values and also the codex9code value. p  pBut the tricky part is that I do not just make a regression and then a loop for codepredictcode because I select a part of the dataframe codetempcode based on the values of codex1code which I split in 8 different ranges and then, according to the value codex1code of the dataframe codeforBacktestcode, I make a regression with a part of codetempcode with codex1code in a given range.p  pSo what I do is that for each one of the 200 rows, I take codex1code and if codex1code is between 0 and 1 for example then I create a part of codetempcode where all the codex1code are between 0 and 1, then I make a regression to explain codex9code with codex1code, codex2code, ... codex9code just codex1x2...code, there is no codex1x2code, codex12code,... and then I use the codepredictcode function with the dataframe codeforBacketstcode. If I predict a positive value and if codex9code is positive then I increment a counter codesuccesscode by one idem if both are negative, but if one is positive and the other negative, then codesuccesscode stays the same. Then I take the next row and so on. At the end of the 200 rows, I now have an average of the successes which I return. In fact, I have two averages  one for the codelmcode regression and the other for the codeglmcode regression same methodology, I just take codesignx9code for the variable to explain.p  pSo my question would be  how can I efficiently make that in R, if possible without a big for loop with 200 iterations where for each iteration, it creates a part of the dataframe, makes the regressions, predict the two values, add them to a counter and so on  this is currently my solution but I find it too slow and not very Rlikep  pMy code looks like that p  precodebacktestltfunction      for i in 1dimforBacktest[1]          x1ltforBacktest[i,1]x2ltforBacktest[i,2]...x9ltforBacktest[i,9]         altifelsex1gt1.5,1.45,ifelsex1gt1,0.95,....          bltifelsex1gt1.5,100,ifelsex1gt1,1.55,....         temp2lttemp[tempx1gta100amptempx1ltb100,]         dfltdataframetempx1,tempx2,...tempx9         regltlmtempx9.,datadf         df2ltdata.framex1,x2,...x9         rRegltpredictreg,df2         trueOrFalseltifelsesignrRegx9gt0,1,0         successltsuccesstrueOrFalse          success  codepre

Negative 27758 pI am running a coded UI test, using the Page Object Pattern, not based on recording. The test is on a web app that uses AngularJS. When I run the test using automation the behavior of some pages is different from the manual testing. For example, some filters are based on date pickers. When I change the date range manually, the angular model is refreshed and the new data is rendered in IE. However, when I do that through automation, no data is refreshed although on developer tools, I can see that the request is sent and data received successfully. I made sure that both the manual IE and the automation one are adjusted to the same document mode, 10. I am running my tests using VS2012Win8.1 and VS2013Windows 7 with all updates.p  pI appreciate your help,p  pAhmedp

Negative 27758 pI have been working on inherited code for a few days now and am trying to get a grasp of how maven works and why the project is configured as it is. The project uses Jetty as an httpserver, and serves up an Angular app, in addition to using Jersey to provide RESTful endpoints for the Angular app. The project directory isp  precodesrc     main         config         java             Java code, including Jetty server         webapp             WEBINF                 web.xml             index.html and all things Angular are also in this directory codepre  pAs part of the deployment process, I was told to set up maven such that the project is packaged as a .war.

Now when I run the project, I have conflicts at the Java level, I have discovered that the cause of the problem was the fact that these two new directories now exist in my codetargetclassesWEBINFcode. Removing them and running codetargetclassescom...Root.classcode fixes the problem. But if codetargetclassesWEBINFclassescom...Root.classcode is present, the project starts throwing exceptions at run time. Without diving into the low level exceptions themselves, can someone explain why I would  wouldnt want codeWEBINFclassescode and codeWEBINFlibcode to be generated for me, and if I wouldnt want them, how can I disable their creation in mavenp  pEDIT I have since found that replacing codewebappDirectorycode attribute with codewebXmlcode attribute will prevent the copying of codelibcode and codeclassescode, however, I am still not clear why I would want those directories there in the first place.p

I read in the documentation that codereq.filefilenamecode will return stream of file streams. But how do I access the particular file stream I need since I am only uploading a single file p
