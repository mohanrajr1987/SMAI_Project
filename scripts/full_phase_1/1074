Positive 1074 pI have a server with 3.75GB of memory and 2 core processor. I setup the server with NGINX server and  php5fpm. Assume NGINX uses about 400MB of mem and the ubuntu system uses around 200MB of mem. I will have 3.75GB  400MB  200MB  3240MB left for php5fpmp  pI setup pm.maxchildren  16 and pm.maxspareserver10.p  pI ran full load on the server. It still have about 1.2GB memory left but the cpu usage is already around 95.5.p  pJust wondering what is the best setting to utilize the CPU and the memory. Also right now the request is quite slow as it runs longer.p  pSo just wondering what is the relationship between number of cpu cores and php5fpm I guess the problem is that it runs out of CPU to process the request so it gets slower. p

Also I believed that all browsers visit www even if not explicitly addressed  but that doesnt seem to be the case  so I had to change the mydomain.com A record to my google ip, and set ftp.mydomain.com and mail.mydomain.com to my shared hosting dedicated IP, rather than mydomain.com.p

Also ive added a couple of codeSystem.out.printlnarg0codes for debuggingp  pstrongOn Google Chromestrong works as intended when refreshing with ctrr or ctrshitr. But if you press the refresh button it loads everything but the WebSocket request freezes for a little while. When done freezing the server picks up a couple 2 requests but the first lines are codenullcode, therefor the server stops handling the request and waits for a new request. Then the server picks up a correct WebSocket request and everything continues on as intended. But if you refresh while it is frozen, the server connects to the previous WebSocket and correctly sends codeindex.htmlcode and codestyle.csscode, but fails to send codescript.jscode and throws a codejava.net.SocketExceptioncode and a codejava.lang.NegativeArraySizeExceptioncode because it tries to read a negative number 124 bytes of data.p  pstrongOn FireFoxstrong Wame as google chrome, but it happens randomly instead of when the refresh button is pressed.p  pI also cant connect to the server if a WebSocket is opened, wich is probably because the WebSocket reads the request that the ServerSocket is supposed to read, but im not sure about this and i have no idea how to fix this.p

If you run it through SMS to a machine that has Windows XP SP2 it installs fine. But, if you try to run it through SMS to a machine that has Windows XP SP3 it seems to stall and take hours. It only takes a couple of minutes when run via the other methods. p  pDoes anyone have any insight as to why it is behaving this way with SMS and XP SP3 p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pOur SMS guys think they found the problem. We had asked them to do a reboot before the install. They said that on SP3, some services werent being started before the installer was running. They think this was causing the problem. Theyre going to try adding a delay after the reboot before the install starts. p

Negative 1074 pIve been trying to encapsulate the object mapping in a projects data repository. Perhaps EF will provide the level of abstraction required but for a range of reasons I am using Linq to SQL at the moment. The following code aims to return the users in the database as a list of ModUser objects, where ModUser is POCO that the repository exposesp  precodepublic ListltModUsergt GetUsers      Users.SelectMapUser.ToList   public ExpressionltFuncltUser, ModUsergtgt MapUser      get          return u gt new ModUser              UserId  u.UserId,             UserResources  u.ResourcesMapResource                 public ExpressionltFuncltResource, ModResourcegtgt MapResource  ... codepre  pThe code will fail as I cant call the MapResource expression since I am trying to call it from inside another expression. I have managed to get around this by replacing MapResource with u  new ModResource, then using the ExpressionVisitor to find this placeholder node and replace it with the MapResource expression. p  pI also have similar issues when I try to assign a property of ModUser with an expression involving a single property, i.e. UserResource  MapResource. I have managed to get around this second issue by manually combining the expressions required using the methods on the Expression class.p  pI do realise that I could change the code above to p  precodeUserResources  u.Resourcesr gt MapResource.Compile.Invoker codepre  pBut then the final SQL query produced will need to obtain all the attributes of r, not just the ones needed by MapResouce, since we are now dealing with a function. Also, should MapResouce require access to further tables on r it wont be possible since it is being used as a function not an expression. I could set DeferredLoadingEnabled to true but that would spawn off a multitude of individual queries rather than modifying the main query to join with whatever tables are required.p  pDoes anyone know if these operations are going to become easier in future versions of .NET or am I going about this the wrong way I really like the Linq and Expression features, I just wish I could employ them using more readable code.p  pstrongUpdatedstrongp  pThought I might add some examples of how I have made the expressions more composable. They arent concise, but they get the job done.p  precodepublic ExpressionltFuncltUser, ModUsergtgt MapUser      get          ExpressionltFuncltUser, ModUsergtgt mapUser  u gt new ModUser              UserId  u.UserId,             UserResources  u.Resourcesr gt new ModResource                  return mapUser.MapResourcesthis        public ExpressionltFuncltResource, ModResourcegtgt MapResource  ...    public static ExpressionltFuncltT0, T1gtgt MapResourcesltT0, T1gtthis ExpressionltFuncltT0, T1gtgt exp, DataContext dc      return exp.VisitltMethodCallExpression, ExpressionltFuncltT0, T1gtgtgtm gt          ifm.Arguments.Count gt 1 ampamp m.Arguments[1].Type  typeofFuncltDataContext.Resource, ModResourcegt  Find a select statement that has the sub expression as an argument             The resource mapping expression will require the Resource object, which is obtained here             ParameterExpression resourceParam   LambdaExpressionm.Arguments[1].Parameters[0]             return Expression.Callm.Method, m.Arguments[0], The first argument is the record selection for the select method                 Expression.LambdaltFuncltDataContext.Resource, ModResourcegtgtProvide the proper mapping expression as the projection for the select method                      Expression.Invokedc.MapResource, resourceParam,                      resourceParam                                   return m       codepre  pSo what am I doing here Note that in this version of MapUser I dont create the ModResource object correctly, I just create a dummy version. I then call an expression visitor method that looks for the dummy call and replaces it with the one I originally wanted in there. To me it seems like the expression syntax is lacking as I am able to essentially construct the expression tree I originally wanted, but I have to actually vist the tree to do it. Below is another workaround Ive found that deals with the singular casep  precodepublic ExpressionltFuncltUser, ModUsergtgt MapUser      get          ExpressionltFuncltUser, ModResource, ModUsergtgt mapUser  u, resource gt new ModUser              UserId  u.UserId,             UserResource  resource                   return mapUser.CollapseArgumentMapResource, user gt user.MainResource        public ExpressionltFuncltResource, ModResourcegtgt MapResource  ...   public static ExpressionltFuncltT0, T3gtgt CollapseArgumentltT0, T1, T2, T3gtthis ExpressionltFuncltT0, T1, T3gtgt exp, ExpressionltFuncltT2, T1gtgt exp0, ExpressionltFuncltT0, T2gtgt exp1      var param0  Expression.ParametertypeofT0, p0     var argExp  Expression.Invokeexp0, Expression.Invokeexp1, param0     return Expression.LambdaltFuncltT0, T3gtgt          Expression.Invokeexp, param0, argExp,          param0  codepre  pIn this second example I know that I can obtain the Resource data from the User data but I cant inline an expression to show how to do this and map the Resource data to a resource POCO. But I can manually create an expression tree that is given an already mapped resource POCO and use it. I can then create another expression that shows how to obtain the resource raw data from the user and a final expression that shows how to map the raw resource data into a resource POCO. It is now conceivable that I can combine all of this information into a single expression tree in a way that collapses out the resource specific parameter since I can obtain it from the primary user parameter. This is what the code above does.p  pSo Ive found ways to make expressions highly composable... It just doesnt feel clean.p

The Framebuffer attached to the texture is persistent, and in each render loop I draw more rectangles to the texture  eventually filling the screen.p  pI have found that if I do not set codeglColorcode to white 100 opacity before rendering the texture to the screen, rectangles of particular colours will not be rendered.

Negative 1074 pI work in a team which has been doing the traditional waterfall method of development for many years.  Recently, weve been told that future projects are going to be moving towards an agile particularly Scrum methodology.  It so happens that my project will be one of the first, so we will essentially be guinea pigs for the next few months to iron out what it takes to make the transition.p  pThe project itself is in a very early stage and we would usually be many months away from releasing anything to the testing team, but now we are going to be working directly with them up front. As a result, Im concerned as to the role of the testers in such a project at this stage.  I have several questionsconcerns which hopefully some experienced agile developers could answerp  ol liWhile a developer is coding a task, it is impossible for a tester to test it it doesnt exist yet. What then is the role of a tester at this pointli liIs the tester now involved in unit testing Is this done parallel to black box testingli liWhat does the tester do during a sprint where primarily infrastructural changes have been made, that may only be testable in unit testingli ol  pHow do the traditional test team members function in your agile projectp

Negative 1074 pI am pretty familiar with CSS and have used quite a bit of javascript and jquery also little experience of layout designing and working closely with Photoshop. But, somehow I dont feel as confident as when programming with database or C side and face lot of problems when I am working with designing UI and laying out elements the way I want, For e.g. Like say a .psd file which the designers give to you...and you want to make your page look exactly like that..p  pSo I know I just have to get into doing it more and learn along the way. But does anyone have any good suggestions or advice so that I get better at the UI programming...If there are some websites with videos and tutorial or any good books I should refer to improve..Thanks all for your help..p

Negative 1074 pstrongProblem statement strong The virtual keyboard is required in linux environment which should be launched every time when user presses on editable UI components, like virtual keyboard in iPhone, iPad, Android, etc.p  pstrongSolution overview strong As basis for virtual keyboard was taken matchboxkeyboard which is an opensource application and provides rich functionality. The mechanism of autotoggling was solved by modifying the source of QT and GTK to send Dbus signals on onpress signal when user presses on editable UI comp. to some daemon which turns virtual keyboard on.p  pstrongIssue strong onpress Dbus signal is sent when user presses or clicks on UI components i.e. during onclick event of QT and GTK. The virtual keyboard is hidden on focusout event of QT and GTK. Keyboard is not switched on during focusin event because some application while launching are emitting focusin event for a moment then emitting focusout event, so virtual keyboard was shows for a short time then hidden which was not accurate. this was solved by generating onpress Dbus signal during onclick GTK and QT events. p  pSo now here I have another problem.p  ol liLets say user pressed on editable box, virtual keyboard appeared,  onclick GTK, QT event  onpress Dbus signal  virtual keyboard is launchedli liThen user presses on Tab button to switch to other editable box. focusout GTK, QT event  hidekeyboard Dbus signal  virtual keyboard is hidden and is not launched again.li ol  pThis happens because the second editable box emits focusin event and not onclick event. p  pSo please help to find a solution for the case when user switches between editable box with tab button.

Negative 1074 pHello and thank you very much for your helpp  pDoes anybody have a good idea to find unreferenced objects of a specific class before garbage collection preferable as soon as possiblep  pIn my case, I need to create a lot of small objects of a specific class for temporary use only. The problem is that I dont know when the object is not needed anymore. I would like to collect the objects of that class which are not referenced any more as soon as possible before garbage collection so that I can recycle them and dont need to create them new. I think that would make the code much faster.p  pKind Regards, Davidp

Negative 1074 pIve been working with images in the frequency domain by taking the DFT or FFT of an image and I know that convolution in the space domain is multiplication in the frequency. p  pSo my question is, if I wanted to apply a specific kernel lets say a 9x9 smoothing kernel in the space domain, I would just convolve the whole image by the 9x9 filter.  Now, if I wanted to do the same thing in the frequency domain, do I take the FFT of both the image and the kernel  Then howwhat do I multiply  After I have that new set of data image multiplied by kernel, I just reverse the direction of the FFT and that should give me the same result as the kernel convolved with the image in the space domain, rightp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 1074 pI have succesfully written some CUDA FFT code that does a 2D convolution of an image, as well as some other calculations. p  pHow do I go about figuring out what the largest FFTs I can run are It seems to be that a plan for a 2D R2C convolution takes 2x the image size, and another 2x the image size for the C2R. This seems like a lot of overhead p  pAlso, it seems like most of the benchmarks and such are for relatively small FFTs..why is this It seems like for large images, I am going to quickly run out of memory. How is this typically handled Can you perform an FFT convolution on a tile of an image and combine those results, and expect it to be the same as if I had run a 2D FFT on the entire imagep  pThanks for answering these questionsp

Negative 1074 pI have a function which manipulates a very large list, exceeding about 250,000 items. For the majority of those items, it simply replaces the item at position x. However, for about 5 of them, it must remove them from the list.p  pUsing a LinkedList seemed to be the most obvious solution to avoid expensive removals. However, naturally, accessing a LinkedList by index becomes increasingly slow as time goes on. The cost here is minutes and a lot of them.p  pUsing an Iterator over that LinkedList is also expensive, as I appear to need a separate copy to avoid Iterator concurrency issues while editing that list. The cost here is minutes.p  pHowever, heres where my mind is blown a bit. If I change to an ArrayList, it runs almost instantly.p  pFor a list with 297515 elements, removing 11958 elements and modifying everything else takes 909ms. I verified that the resulting list is indeed 285557 in size, as expected, and contains the updated information I need.p  pWhy is this so fast I looked at the source for ArrayList in JDK6 and it appears to be using an arraycopy function as expected. I would love to understand why an ArrayList works so well here when common sense would seem to indicate that an array for this task is an awful idea, requiring shifting several hundred thousand items.p

Negative 1074 pI have been assigned the task of reading a .txt file which is a log of various events and writing some of those events into a dictionary.p  pThe problem is that the file can sometimes get bigger than 3GB in size. This means that the dictionary gets too big to fit into main memory. It seems that a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibraryshelve.htmlshelveexampleShelvea is a good way to solve this problem. However, since I will be constantly modifying the dictionary, I must have the codewritebackcode option enabled. This is where I am concerned  the tutorial says that this would slow down the readwrite process and use more memory, but I am unable to find statistics on how the speed and memory are affected.p  pCan anyone clarify by how much the readwrite speed and memory are affected so that I can decide whether to use the writeback option or sacrifice some readability for code efficiencyp  pThank youp

Negative 1074 pA Java project I am working on is having a bizarre conflict between Java3d and Swing tooltips.p  pOur program is setup with a Java3D Canvas3D in the center surrounded by Swing JComponents buttons, sliders, text boxes, and the like. The keyboard and mouse are used to move around the 3d world and the buttons allow other manipulations.p  pThe problem is that whenever a tool tip from the Swing components extends outside our window a JFrame, the movement in Java3D slows to a crawl and has major stuttering issues. Because of all the problems we have read about regarding heavyweightlightweight mixing in swing, we assumed that was likely to be the issue.p  pOur original solution was to override each components getToolTipLocation method to ensure the tooltips stay inside our window. This seemed to mostly work, but it left the tooltips in odd locations. In addition, we occasionally get the stutteringslow down issue as soon as the program launches and before any tooltips have been generated every 2030 launches.p  pThen yesterday I discovered an ever stranger way of fixing it. As long as the tooltips are 151 pixels wide or greater, they dont cause the slowdown problem going outside the window. Any tooltip that is 150 pixels wide or less causes our slowdownstuttering issue as soon as it leaves the window. By overriding createToolTip  in each type of component we use, we can call setPreferedSize and ensure that all the tool tips are 151 pixels wide. The problems with this workaround, of course, is that all the tooltips have either lots of blank space or are truncated.p  pDoes anyone have any idea what could be causing this odd behavior and what I could try to fix itp

Should this be the same format as the output for the remoteio And if so was I wrong to set the output format of the remote io to stereostreamformatp  pI realize theres and awful lot in this question but I have a lot of uncertainties that I cant seem to clear up on my own.p  pstrongsetup stereo stream formatstrongp  precode void setupStereoStreamFormat       sizet bytesPerSample  sizeof AudioUnitSampleType     stereoStreamFormat.mFormatID           kAudioFormatLinearPCM     stereoStreamFormat.mFormatFlags        kAudioFormatFlagsAudioUnitCanonical     stereoStreamFormat.mBytesPerPacket     bytesPerSample     stereoStreamFormat.mFramesPerPacket    1     stereoStreamFormat.mBytesPerFrame      bytesPerSample     stereoStreamFormat.mChannelsPerFrame   2                     2 indicates stereo     stereoStreamFormat.mBitsPerChannel     8  bytesPerSample     stereoStreamFormat.mSampleRate         engineDescribtion.samplerate      NSLog The stereo stereo format     codepre  pstrongsetup remoteio callback using stereo stream formatstrongp  precodeAudioUnitSetPropertyengineDescribtion.masterChannelMixerUnit,                               kAudioUnitPropertyStreamFormat,                               kAudioUnitScopeOutput,                               masterChannelMixerUnitloop,                               ampstereoStreamFormat,                               sizeofstereoStreamFormat          AudioUnitSetPropertyengineDescribtion.masterChannelMixerUnit,                               kAudioUnitPropertyStreamFormat,                               kAudioUnitScopeInput,                               masterChannelMixerUnitloop,                               ampstereoStreamFormat,                               sizeofstereoStreamFormat     static OSStatus masterChannelMixerUnitCallbackvoid inRefCon,                                AudioUnitRenderActionFlags ioActionFlags,                                const AudioTimeStamp inTimeStamp,                                UInt32 inBusNumber,                                UInt32 inNumberFrames,                                AudioBufferList ioData        ref.equnit     AudioUnitRenderengineDescribtion.channelMixers[inBusNumber], ioActionFlags, inTimeStamp, 0, inNumberFrames, ioData     Engine engine Engine  inRefCon     AudioUnitRenderengineDescribtion.equnit, ioActionFlags, inTimeStamp, 0, inNumberFrames, ioData      ifenginegtisrecording              ExtAudioFileWriteAsyncenginegtrecordingfileref, inNumberFrames, ioData             return 0   codepre  pemthe recording setup emp  precodevoidstartrecording        NSArray  paths  NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomainsNSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES     NSString documentsDirectory  [paths objectAtIndex0]     destinationFilePath  [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat testrecording.wav, documentsDirectory]     destinationURL  CFURLCreateWithFileSystemPathkCFAllocatorDefault, CFStringRefdestinationFilePath, kCFURLPOSIXPathStyle, false      OSStatus status       prepare a 16bit int file format, sample channel count and sample rate     AudioStreamBasicDescription dstFormat     dstFormat.mSampleRate44100.0     dstFormat.mFormatIDkAudioFormatLinearPCM     dstFormat.mFormatFlagskAudioFormatFlagsNativeEndiankAudioFormatFlagIsSignedIntegerkAudioFormatFlagIsPacked     dstFormat.mBytesPerPacket4     dstFormat.mBytesPerFrame4     dstFormat.mFramesPerPacket1     dstFormat.mChannelsPerFrame2     dstFormat.mBitsPerChannel16     dstFormat.mReserved0       create the capture file   status  ExtAudioFileCreateWithURLdestinationURL, kAudioFileWAVEType, ampdstFormat, NULL, kAudioFileFlagsEraseFile, amprecordingfileref     CheckError status ,couldnt create audio file          set the capture files client format to be the canonical format from the queue  statusExtAudioFileSetPropertyrecordingfileref, kExtAudioFilePropertyClientDataFormat, sizeofAudioStreamBasicDescription, ampstereoStreamFormat      CheckError status ,couldnt set input format      ExtAudioFileSeekrecordingfileref, 0  isrecordingYES     [documentsDirectory release]    codepre  pstrongedit 1strongp  pIm really stabbing in the dark here now but do I need to use an audio convertor or does kExtAudioFilePropertyClientDataFormat take care of thatp  pstrongedit 2strongp  pIm attaching 2 samples of audio.

Negative 1074 pI have a relationship table in a rails application called codeeditprivilegescode, in which the codeUsercode is the editor and a number of other classes are editable.

This is especially problematic if Im trying to create a method to destroy edit privileges, since you cant pass code.destroycode on an array.p  pI figure appending code.firstcode to the two above solutions returns the first object and codenilcode if the result of the query is an empty has, but is that really the best way to do it Are there any problems with doing it this way like, instead of using dynamic attributebased finders like codefindbyeditabeidandeditabletypecodep

Negative 1074 pThis is the stored procedure for any reason this permalooping p  pI have to make some aclarationsp  pits the first time that i use codeSCROLL KEYSET SCROLLLOCKScode and codeWHERE CURRENT OFcodep  pthe short explanation of what this does       replacing a temporal id for many rows with a permanent id that is the codeMAXnumsubproceso1code but I want it to do in ACID fashion to solve possible concurrence iusses.p  pI cant use transaction directly in my app, the reason for this is that Im using a classes set of my authorship that abstract the structure of the database and the data behavior in this way, only of the downside of my specific implementation is that i cant use a transaction because my code often in rapid openingclosing connection cycles and i need to make a transaction of big chunk of sqls. p  pTo avoid this I finished generating a negative random id to write the rows in the database and later use a stored proc to use a transaction and use a cursor with row lock to avoid maybe Im wrong here that other user get the same id using MAX...1 and occurs a problem where 2 user write the same primary key.p  pWhy Im saying that Im preventing concurrency problem I could be wrong if I lock a row that Im using and other user makes an operation ex. MAX... to get a new id over the whole set of rows in the same table, the lock that is blocking my row  prevent that the 2nd client can get the result and stay in wait state until my lock is releasedp  pThe process is long and get various steps in a way that pass a time between start and finish the whole process .p  p... the permanent id is the max number of that type of id plus one ... in this way while the temporal id is the same at first the permanent id can vary p  h2data exampleh2  pbeforep  precodecvesubproceso PK  numsubproceso PK  inidate ddmmyyyy hhMMss  A01                  27813578125         01052011 090000 A02                  27813578125         15052011 100000 A03                  27813578125         16052011 073000 A07                  27813578125         21052011 091500 A12                  27813578125         30052011 100000 ...                  ...                  ... codepre  pafterp  precodecvesubproceso PK  numsubproceso PK  inidate ddmmyyyy hhMMss  A01                  157                  01052011 090000 A02                  122                  15052011 100000 A03                  15                   16052011 073000 A07                  90                   21052011 091500 A12                  140                  30052011 100000 ...                  ...                  ... codepre  h2How is calculated [numsubproceso]h2  pthe number of the permanent id is based in how many [cvesubproceso] are in the table.p  prelated to this example ... exists or existed at given time 156 A01 secuenced from 1 to 156 when im adding 157 to A01 in this case, is because i calculated MAX[numsubproceso] and MAX returned 156p  precodecvesubproceso PK  numsubproceso PK  inidate ddmmyyyy hhMMss  A01                  156                  01052011 090000 A01                  155                  15042011 100000 A01                  154                  03042011 073000 A01                  152                  11032011 091500 A01                  151                  10012011 100000 ...                  ...                  ... codepre  pi repeat the same operation for each value of [cvesubproceso] ...p  h2SP codeh2  precodeALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[ReprocesarEventos]   Add the parameters for the stored procedure here numSubproceso int  0 AS  BEGIN      SET NOCOUNT ON added to prevent extra result sets from      interfering with SELECT statements.

Negative 1074 pI have huge amount of records in oracle database that some operations souhld be done for them. The application gets 4 parameters as input. They are Range from, Range to, Thread counts and blockSize. By using this parameters, the application calculates how many records should be assigned to every thread. When a thread starts, it fetches records from databasee blockSize by blockSize and does some operations and then, saves records to another table of databse. I tested the application with 10,000 records in a machine with 8 cpus and set Number of threads to 8. There is no problem. In real environment, there are 1,000,000 records and 16 cpus.

Negative 1074 pI have a web application that uses WCF to communicate with the backend DB. I already have everything working but I was wondering if it would be better to split up my fairly large Service Contract into several Contracts.p  pAs it stands the service contract is a single general file with all operations contained within it. I know I could break it up into smaller contracts that are assocaited with the Data Objects in my business logic i.e. A Person object has a PersonContract etc.,p  pI am just worried that the web application will have to reference several WCF Services instead of the one and suffer as a result of this. Will having several smaller contracts in anyway affect performance, either negatively or positivelyp  pThanks.p

Negative 1074 pIve been asked to beautify default Jackson JSON coming out of a RestEasy endpoint. I did some research on Jackson and wrote some standalone code to be able to suppress nulls, customize data formats etc. Now the challenge is injecting this code in RestEasys JSON serialization. p  pJudging from the forum posts this is trivial in Spring, however doesnt seem to be the case in RestEasy. I wrote a ContextResolver and configured as resteasy.provider in context params in web.xml on Tomcat but that prevents the webapp from loading on Tomcat. p  pNow Im trying to extend javax.ws.rs.core.Application and provide a ContextResolver but making no progress. Is this straight forward, has anyone done this Any help is greatly appreciated.p

My projects are organized in a directory structure, but the path of the projects base directory frequently varies between different computers e.g. because I just do parts of data analysis for someone else, and their directory structure is different from mine I have projects base directories ProjectsStudentName or ProjectsStudentnameProjectname and most students who have just their one Project usually have it under Measurements or DataAnalysis or something the like  which wouldnt work for me.p  pSo a line like p  precode    setwd my.own.path   codepre  pwould be incredibly useful as it would allow to ensure the working directory is the base path of the project regardless of where that project actually is.

Negative 1074 pShort is there a posix way to check what driver is used by certain USB device, for example using codeioctlcodep  pAnd now, why I need itp  pI have a wlan scaning application dedicated for devices that use USB wlan dongles that is derived from iwlist and uses iwlib.p  pI short, what is does is initializing the scan with something like thisp  precodestruct iwreq wrq ioctlskfd, SIOCSIWSCAN, ampwrq codepre  pThan wait for results which are stored at codewrq.u.data.pointercode and then parsed using codeiwextracteventstreamcode that tokenizes the data into codestruct iwevent iwecode tokens which contains information about detected networks. p  pThis is the background, now my real problem begins. To get the signal quality we need to find token labelled as codeIWEVQUALcode and then read value from codeiwe.u.qual.qualcode. Unfortunatelly, for some drivers and system architectures this value is always wrong. Because for some reasons I couldntdidnt want to change the driver, I had to implement some workaround that calculates the signal quality using signal levelp  precodecase IWEVQUAL    const int lvlmax  0.9  range.maxqual.levelrange.maxqual.level  255   const int lvlmin  lvlmax  0.6 we assume that signal below this sevel is not received   int lvl  iwe.u.qual.level gt lvlminiwe.u.qual.level  lvlmin however it might happen, since our assumption is very weak   int lvlscaled    lvl gt lvlmaxlvllvlmax0it may also happen that actual level is higher that the max we assumed    lvlscaled  lvl  lvlmin  lvlmax  lvlmax  lvlmin    ifapinfo  NULL break   apinfogtubRssi  100  lvlscaled  lvlmax  codepre  pAs you see, it is pretty dirty way, based on a lot of arbitrary assumptions, so it is better to use original value from codeiwe.u.qual.qualcode whenever possible. Hence, I would like to check if the driver used by currently plugged device can use standard way or I should use the hocus pocus described above.p

Negative 1074 pIm new to C amp threading and I recently started working on a utility thats using multiple threads. I have some event handling logic being done by one thread, and then a GUI on a separate thread that is observing the event handler and receiving notifications when new events are received.p  pWhen the GUI is manually closed by the user I detach it so that its no longer observing the event handler. However, the next time the event handler receives an event it thinks that it still has something in its list of observers. I added some print outsbreakpoints and it seems to go into NotifyObservers and hits the foreach loop, then goes into the detach method, empties the observer list, and then when it goes back into NotifyObservers the observer it tries to access has already been disposed and it gets an exception.p  pI saw on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions34510whatisaraceconditionthis pagea that youre supposed to use locks to prevent race conditions from occurring and I tried using one on the observers list before the foreach in NotifyObservers and it still gets the exception. Im thinking it might have something to do with locking not being able to prevent the GUI from closing on the other thread, so the other thread does not wait when I try to lock, but Im new to this so Im not really sure. I tried throwing a bunch of other locks around in these methods as well and nothing seemed to have any effect.p  pIve included the code for the 3 methods involved below, Detach and NotifyObservers are in my event handler, and HandleClosing is in my observerp  precode    protected void HandleClosingobject sender, EventArgs e              handler.Detachthis           public void DetachSubscriberObserver observer              observers.Removeobserver           public void NotifyObservers              foreach SubscriberObserver observer in observers                      observer.Invokenew Action gt  observer.Notify                codepre

This is what i want.p  pHowever if a user logges in an goes from my login form to my main desktop window and then clicks x, it calles the addWindowListener event in the main window and asks if they wish to logout. Problem is when ever they click on an action it asks it again. I have checked into this and it seems to be happening each time a new window is called.p  pSo... may question is how can i make my event only be called oncep  pFurther examplesp  pStart Program  Click X  Click Cancel this works fine Start Program  Login  Click X in Main window  Click Cancel asks againp

I tried using fpdf and fpdi files but when modifying scanned pages its showing FPDF error Unable to find object 8, 0 at expected location error. My application is not based on zend so I dont want to use zendpdf for this, I tried many other options, am using shared hosting so am not able to install new extensions of php. Is there any library or something which can do it for me, or if I could do this with pure php.p

I am wondering if there is a more efficient way of implementing such an algo, and preferably, reducing the time to strongemOnemstrong.p  pActually, as Mark Byers pointed out there is a second variable codemcode, which is the size of the number of elements being selected.

Negative 1074 pIve found a few questions on modelling manytomany relationships, but nothing that helps me solve my current problem.p  h3Scenarioh3  pIm modelling a domain that has codeUsercodes and codeChallengecodes. Challenges have many users, and users belong to many challenges. Challenges exist, even if they dont have any users.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnCc9b.png altenter image description herep  pSimple enough. My question gets a bit more complicated as users can be emrankedem on the challenge. I can store this information on the challenge, as a set of users and their rank  again not too tough.p  h3Questionh3  pWhat scheme should I use if I want to query the individual rank of a user on a challenge without getting the ranks of all users on the challenge At this stage, I dont care emhowem I make the call in data access, I just dont want to return hundreds of rank data points when I only need one.p  pI also want to know emwhereem to store the rank information it feels like its dependent upon both a user and a challenge. Heres what Ive consideredp  ol liThe obvious when instantiating a codeChallengecode, just get all the rank information slower but works.li lipMake a composite codeUserChallengecode entity, but that feels like it goes against the domain we dont go around talking about userchallenges.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZbHn5.png altenter image description herepli lipThird optionpli ol  pI want to go with number two, but Im not confident enough to know if this is really the DDD approach.p  h3Updateh3  pI suppose I could call codeUserChallengecode something more domain appropriate like codeRankcode, codeUserRankcode or somethingp

Negative 1074 pI have successfully been using the eclipse Indigo internal browser to view my web apps. Im playing around with the Spring petclinic application. After a recent OS X 10.7 update to 10.7.4 from 10.7.3, the text boxes rendered inside of the internal web browser have black backgrounds and text can only been seen when highlighted.p  pIve tested my app with chrome, firefox, and safari on my mac and they all render correctly. The only change I can think of is the OS update. Ive checked for updates to my browsers, OS, eclipse, and eclipse plugins.p  pIve googled extensively and see a lot of people complaining about the internal browser in general, but nothing recently. I have also found people asking how to swap out the renderer and have found posts saying that is no longer possible. The most interesting part about this is, if I launch Aptana Studio at the same time as my app is up, I can use the internal browser in Aptana and my app looks fine, just like it did last week.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 1074 pRelatively simple question regarding the value of session ID  Session ID is tied to a specific instance of the browser, correct instance meaning window  So I start with an empty desktop WinXP or Win7 or whatever client OS.  I open an IE browser window and request a web page from an ASP.NET website.  I then open a second IE browser window and request the same web page from the same ASP.NET website.  1 I assume there will be 2 different session IDs, one for each of the two IE browser windows, correct  Then, I open an additional tab within one of the IE browser windows.  2 Will that additional tab have the same session ID as the browser window, or will it have a third unique session ID  I know I could do a little testing to look at this but I need to answer a bosss question right away LOL  so I figured someone could probably just answer this question off the top of their head.

Negative 1074 pFirst off we are using Visual Studio 2010, .Net 4 and SQL Server 2008 R2 and Cp  pWe currently are migrating an old application to .Net. In fact, its a full rewrite.p  pThe application will be a serverclient setup and fully fits the occasionally connected description.p  pA typical installation involves 10 clients and one server. The clients are accessing a pool of semistatic data from the database lets call this the coredata.p  pThe clients also add a range of new entries each day about 700 to 800 to another table. lets just call this postings.p  pNow we want to have a local database as a cache for two purposesp  ol lipFor our main customer the coredata consists of about 200000 entries and there are about 100 changes each day. We want to cache this data on the clients because we need fast access to it.pli lipFor several other, smaller customers we do not have dedicated servers running. One of the client machines is doing this job. If the users shut down the server the clients wont be able to save the new postings. This actually is an acute problem and happens quite often untrained users. We need some kind of cache for this.pli ol  pNow, I read about the local database cache you can add via Visual Studio and I already gave it a try.p  pIn theory, this is exactly what we need. However, in reality I encountered a few difficultiesp  ol lipI noticed that when creating the local cache DB the foreign key relations are missing from the local DB. I saw that this is documented as working as intended, however I was not able to find an instruction on how to properly include them so I can rely on them in the local DB and Ill still be able to sync. p  pAfter I added the relations myself I still ended up with syncing problemsp  pI have two tables, Table A and Table B. I added one entry on table A and 30 entries on table B referencing the entry in table A.p  pUpon Syncing table A was synced correctly  on table B no entries were synced.p  pI added another 30 entries to table B and tried to sync again. this time it ignored the first 30 entries and tried to only sync the new 30 entries. out of those it only synced one successfully. I am clearly missing something here.pli lipA purely theoretical question The sync can be Upload Only, Download Only etc. What wed need is something like Post Only. Because I was not able to get the whole setup working Ill add this question without having tested it myselfp  pWhat will happen if I sync Upload Only and clear all entries from the local DB after syncing Will it delete the entries from the server upon the next sync If yes, can we still use the Sync Service for this purpose or should we use a DataSet and post the entries manually to the serverpli ol

Negative 1074 pThis is the weirdest problem that I have ever encountered in XCode.p  pRecently I wanted to add a certain SDK to my app. Im not going to name this SDK because I dont want to discredit their name. Anyway, the strange thing is that whenever I included the SDK into my app, while it can work ok in the app, during upload after validate success, the uploader just hangs there and not uploading any data at all for a long time i waited about 10minutes. No progress whatsoever.p  pThen I removed the SDK, and commented out the related SDK codes just delegates, I was able to upload fine. Then just for sure, I added back the SDK and implemented the SDK codes, again, archive the app, validate, and try to upload, it just stuck there again.p  pAnybody have any idea why is this so p  pIt is so annoying. Organizer did not give any message either.p

The question is is it an application problemp  pI tried purging the pool via JMX but that doesnt seem to have any effect. Another weird thing is that even though app is apparently not doing anything checked via thread dump the JMX bean is showing 7 active connections and 0 idle connections. When I execute a request requiring DB access I get a response immediately depite there being no idle connections available, but JMX shows 7 active and 0 idle connections after that.p  pPS. Maybe Im missing something obvious and this is a connection management issue on my part Im using JPA EntityManager configured via persistence.xml, so maybe Im doing something wrong and the connections are not closedreturned properly after usep

Negative 1074 pWorking and learning at the same time to use Android, I have noticed some weirdunexpectednotsodocumented behaviour from its layout switching functionality, for which I have not found an answer yet.p  pFirst, as the documentation suggests, qualifiers for width and height, such as codelayoutw320dpcode and codelayouth320pcodeshould use the standard values  240, 320, 480, 600 and so on. While the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.html relnofollowdocumentationa also mentions that the effectively available space is taken into account, it makes no further mention as to how this affects height. For example, by calling codegetResources.getConfiguration.screenHeightDpcode on a 320dp large emulator screen, the available height returned is 295. Thus, using codelayouth320pcode is inaccurate, as it will not activate properly on a 320dp screen.p  pThe stuff which I am writing, in what concerns adapting to small screens has should have the capability of handling two scenarios one where there is not enough width, and one where there is not enough height. What I have found is that I cannot force the emulator to choose the correct layout for my situation I have a folder for codelayoutw320pcode and another for codelayouth240pcode. When running on a emulator with 320p available height and 480p available width, the codelayoutw320pcode loads. How can one homogeneously treat such two cases One cannot specify both a width and a height qualifier.p  pThird, since if one wants to support ones app until 2.2, is there any way to support different screens except by the means of classical qualifiers small, medium, large, xlarge p  pEdit Ive resorted to using the smallmediumlargexlarge qualifier pattern, since the minimum version I want to support is 2.2. I also use the codeportcode and codelandcode qualifiers, and Androids decision making in layouts is much more clear this way, but the aforementioned issues remain.p
Negative 1074 pI have a project idea for which I want to mine publicly available data on another website that it received by crowdsourcing. This is so I have initial data for my own project. To reiterate, I want to write a robot to grab data that is displayed on another website and use it for my own website. Does anyone know the legality of this sort of thing Does the original website own the data that was given to it by a crowd Even if so, can I use itp  pThanksp
Negative 1074 pRunning in API14 emulator with WVGA800 screen with 24MB heap I am having problems with background images of my views, where it looks like the are drawables are not being released between view navigations and after 3 views are displayed an Out of memory exception occurs inflating a view. p  pThe app starts with a SplashScreenActivity which has a 480x800 PNG as its background image to use for the startup splash screen. The app proceeds to navigate to its next view which also displays a new 480x800 px. The third screen navigation also contains 480x800 PNG and this when the out of memory error occurs. First I tried this with setting the background in the axml layout. then I tried alternative method of setting the background from code in the SplashScreenActivity.OnCreate and the other two view OnCreate methods. I read elsewhere that disposing the drawable release it from the mono vm in case this was the problem. Another trick which helped was to force a GC at the beginning of OnCreate this left 12 of the heap free but this had limited success.p  precodepublic class SplashScreenActivity MvxBaseSplashScreenActivity      public SplashScreenActivity  baseResource.Layout.SplashScreen        protected override void OnCreateBundle bundle              base.OnCreatebundle          using var drawable  Resources.GetDrawableResource.Drawable.LoadingScreen             Window.SetBackgroundDrawabledrawable       codepre  pAnd the second viewp  precodepublic class GameView  MvxBindingActivityViewltGameViewModelgt      public GameView  SoundBinding.GameView  this       protected override void OnViewModelSet  SetContentViewResource.Layout.GameView       protected override void OnCreateBundle bundle               GC.Collect         base.OnCreatebundle         using var drawable  Resources.GetDrawableResource.Drawable.GameScreenBackground             Window.SetBackgroundDrawabledrawable       codepre  pAfter all this the App still runs out of memory on inflating a third similar view with background. Sometimes it will work, and then as screens cycle eventually it occurs. I looked at the heap dump on MAT and I can see two bitmapDrawables of 3.5M in size. I assume these are my two bitmaps. For the 2nd BitmapDrawable I can clearly see the view that is holding onto it. There is another bitmap still in memory but i cant see what its path to GC root is. This must be the first loaded PNG in the first SplashScreenActivity view. Here is its MAT Path to GC roots without weak refs. There is a weak ref holding it as well.p  precodeandroid.graphics.Bitmap  0x4134fb08            40      3,456,056  mBitmap android.graphics.drawable.BitmapDrawable  0x4134f568            64            136    mBackgroundDrawable com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow  0x41356cc8 Native Stack            200          1,168    mBGDrawable com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindowDecorView  0x41357560 Native Stack          560            968    Total 2 entries                                                                                                               mBitmap android.graphics.drawable.BitmapDrawableBitmapState  0x4134f460                                 40             40     referent java.lang.ref.WeakReference  0x4134ff40            24             24  Total 2 entries                               codepre  pSo question time. How do I ensure these drawables are released before the next view is inflated Is it necessary to set the backgrounds in code rather than the layouts of the views Do I need to unbindDrawables by setting callback to null as seen here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7044770drawablevssinglereusablebitmapbetterwithmemoryDrawable vs Single reusable Bitmap better with memorya  I investigated the OnDestroy overide of the views, but I found these where not being called before the new view is created. When navigating from one view to another is there away to ensure a view is destroyed and would this help release my resources before the next view is inflated.p  pAny advice on how better manage these resources in my app would be much appreciated.p

Negative 1074 pSo I have been assigned this project and have been giving it the old college try but I am a little lost on how to go about it. The idea is youre given a txt file with a grammar in the formp  ul liV S, A, B, Cli liT a, bli liS Sli liP li liS  aAaAaABBAli liA  AaaAli liB  bBbbCli liC  Bli ul  pThese productions rules wont be the only ones tested but thats just an example.p  pSo the first step is to read in the program. The next step is to remove Lambda  productions. and the final step is to remove unit productions.p  pI am ... the way Im removing lambda productions is not the best way I think.p  pHeres how Im doing it.p  pSo first, use getline to read in the file. Next use some loops to go through a file.p  pNow in an array, Ive stored the non terminals that correspond to a rule with a lambda production, so keep that in mind.p  pSo, while going through each character in each production, check if that character is the same as one in the array of the non terminals that denote lambda productions excluding the index 0 because thats the start of the productionp  pif you find a match, mark that index youre onp  pso say your going through S.p  pS  a no problem s  aA Ok a bit of a problemp  pinstead of writing the A, dont. skip over it and then using another loop, print out the remaining chunk of that production rule that is, print out until you hit a bar so we get S  aaAp  pnow draw a barp  pS  aaA now return the index to the first character in this chunk, here being a. From there, rewrite the character up through where you first hit the non terminal.p  pS  aaAaAp  pnow continue looping through to find the next non terminal thats a lambdap  pS  aaA  aAaA here we arep  pdraw a barp  pS  aaA  aAa p  pmove back to beginning, continue throughp  pS  aaA  aAa  aAaAp  pcontinue reading through the grammar and outputing each characters and repeat this process to getp  pS  aaA  aAa  aAaA  aABB  aBBA  aABBAp  pat the end of all the code, I have two loops that check for the original bars in the grammar i replace them with s when I did it and then output at the end the form that has all lambda productions as lambdas givingp  pS  aaA  aAa  aAaA  aa  aABB  aBBA  aABBA  aBBp  pIm going to include the code here but, be warned,... its rough. Its rough enough that I cant actually get it to fall nicely under the codeing blocks in here so im going link it.p  pa hrefhttppastebin.com78yv3czJ relnofollowCodeap  pI appreciate any ideas on how you would undertake this project or if im doing something blatantly wrong.p  pThe code currently throws out some errors which im pretty sure are the cause of me reading some empty characters somewhere but if you ignore them itll spit out to console the right thing... mostly.p  pAppreciate any help, thank you for taking the time to read all this mess.p
Negative 1074 pIm working on a game here, and found this rather intriguing bug. Suppose you have this enump  precodepublic enum ItemType       Food,     Weapon,     Tools,     Written,     Misc  codepre  pa base classp  precodepublic class BaseItem      public string Name  Default Name      public ItemType Type  ItemType.Misc  codepre  pand two instances of itp  precodeIns1  new BaseItem     Name  Something,    Type  ItemType.Food   Ins2  new BaseItem     Name  Something too,    Type  ItemType.Tools  codepre  pThis is what happened to me The first instances type would remain as preinitialized in the base class, even though I specified in its constructor that I want the type to be Food. The 2nd instances type would be set correctly to Tools.p  pIF, I added a new enum value BEFORE Food, such asp  precodepublic enum ItemType       Nothing,     Food,     Weapon,     Tools,     Written,     Misc  codepre  pThen the 1st instances type would be, as expected, Food. The 2nd instances type would also be correct.p  pWhat could have caused this behavior To describe it in short, all instances whose Type had been set in the constructor to the first value of the enum, would actually go back to the value they had in the BaseItem definition. Adding an extra value before the first enum value solved the problem, apparently but it IS wrong, so Id like to know what could have caused the issue.p  pThanksp  p Later Edit  In case this helps not doing any initialization to the Type field inside of BaseItem, and leaving only the braces constructor do the initialization, everything works fine without adding the Nothing value to the enum.p  pSorry about this after some more digging, it seems its an Unityonly bug. Some other people encountered it too. I have solved the problem everyone gets a vote up from me, and Ill add my own answer maybe some other Unity users will find it. Thanks a lot for your help and interestp

For example, the number 24s   factors should print asp  precode1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 6 and 8 and 12 and 24 codepre      pYou may assume that the number parameters value is greater than 0.p blockquote  pPlease dont give me a COMPLETE program as I would like to try it out myself.p  pThe current code I have has a for loop to control the number of ands appearing, however, I printed out the last number by itself since I dont want a 24 and attached to it... So the output looks something like this at the moment 1 and 2 and 3 I havent yet thought up the equation hence the 1,2,3...p  pIm currently thinking that the factors requires a  kind of formula right Will I need division I was also thinking of printing out 1 and whatever the number in this case, 24  you are finding factors for, since 1 and the number itself are always factors of itself. What else am I missingp  pThanks in advance p

Negative 1074 pI found this in the Quartz 2D Programming Guidep  blockquote   pTo draw to the screen in an iOS application, you set up a UIView object and implement its drawRect method to perform drawing. The views drawRect method is called when the view is visible onscreen and its contents need updating. Before calling your custom drawRect method, the view object automatically configures its drawing environment so that your code can start drawing immediately. As part of this configuration, the UIView object creates a graphics context a CGContextRef opaque type for the current drawing environment. You obtain this graphics context in your drawRect method by calling the UIKit function UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext.p blockquote  pSince I am having problems with invalid Context because its 0x00 when I go back to redraw, I was wondering if I could get the current context in the beginning of strongdrawRectstrong and somehow pass it to the methods I call from within strongdrawRectstrongp
Negative 1074 pIm porting a blog from WordPress to BlogEngine.NET. Ive written a small WinForm app in C which reads in all the web pages i.e., posts from the WordPress site and outputs an XML file for each post by default, BlogEngine.NET uses XML to store its posts, and that will work fine for my purposes. Then, I FTPd them up to the BlogEngine.NET site and put them under AppDataposts.p  pAt that point, I navigated to the Posts page of the blog where I expected to see a list of all the posts. Unfortunately, only the single sample post included with BlogEngine.NET shows up. I actually stole the code that BlogEngine.NET uses to create the XML files in order to port the posts from WordPress and create the XML files, so Im pretty sure my files are in the correct format.p  pWhy arent my posts showing upp

This results in a different value for the redirecturi parameter.li   liThe clientid and clientsecret obtained during registration are embedded in the source code of your application.

Here are my questions  p  hr  ul liThe redirecturi can be a codehttplocalhostcode URL and can contain any port number.  The port number is not part of the initial API configuration and hence it can be any valid port number. Also the clientid not supposed to be a secret anyway and clientsecret are not really secret since they are embedded in the mobile application source code.li ul  pUsing the above conditions, isnt the following a possibility p  ol liThe user launches App2li liApp2 redirects the user to the Google OAuth2.0 endpoint however in the request, App2 includes clientid for App1 and includes the local port number on which App2 is listening.li liWhen the user is redirected and authenticates to the Google OAuth2.0 endpoint, Google would indicate to the user that App1 Legitimate App is asking to access Google APIsdata on behalf of the user which seems like a phishing attack since the user might click yes thinking it is App1 that is asking for access. li liGoogle OAuth2.0 will then issue an authorization code to App2 and App2 can then make the next request including App1s clientid and clientsecret and obtain the accesstoken and refreshtoken and continue to access user data from Google.li ol  hr  ul liThe redirecturi could also be a  urnietfwgoauth2.0oob which means li ul  blockquote   pThis value signals to the Google Authorization Server that the authorization code should be returned in the title bar of the browser. This is useful when the client cannot listen on an HTTP port without significant client configuration. Windows applications possess this characteristic. p      pWhen this value is used, your application can sense that the page has loaded and the title of the HTML page contains the authorization code. It is then up to your application to close the browser window if you want to ensure that the user never sees the page that contains the authorization code. The mechanism for doing this varies from platform to platform. p blockquote  pThe above means that the authorization code is returned in the title of the browser window. p  pMy question is  Can App2 also sense that the page has loaded and capture the authorization code and then use it before App1 along with the clientid and clientsecret to obtain accesstoken and refreshtoken. Is the browser instance global and any app can monitor it and the above attack scenario is valid or is the browser instance somehow application specific so that only App1 can sensemonitor the changesp  hr  pIs my understanding correct OR Am i missing something Am I missing any mitigation that mitigate the above threats OR Are the above risks valid but accepted given that we are on a mobile OS platformp  pWhat is the secure way of using OAuth2.0 in mobile applications  Display the authorization code in the browser page and have the user manually enter it within the application And in that case is the browser instance private so that another application cannot monitor it and get hold of the authorization code itself before the user types it into the legitimate apicationp  pAny help is appreciatedp  pThanks and Regards,p

At the second time, however, the vector is altered in place. This is noticeable without inspecting the address of the objects if we measure the time to create and modify a large vectorp  precodegt system.timea lt rep1L, 108    user  system elapsed     0.15    0.17    0.31  gt system.timea[222L] lt 111L    user  system elapsed     0.26    0.08    0.34  gt system.timea[333L] lt 111L    user  system elapsed        0       0       0 codepre  pNote that there is no change of typestorage.mode.p  pSo the question is why is it not possible to optimize the first bracket assignment as well In what situation this kind of behaviour full copy at first modification is actually neededp  pEDIT spoiler As explained in the accepted answer below, this is nothing but an artifact of enclosing the first assignment in a codesystem.timecode function call. This causes R to mark the memory space bound to codeacode as possibly referring to more than one symbol, thus requiring duplication when changed. If we remove the enclosing calls, the vector is modified in place from the very first bracket assignment.p  pThanks Martin for indepth solutionp

Negative 1074 pI am trying to take the readout from an instrument and if the readout matches certain strings from the instrument programming manual I want to set an indicator to a specific value, different for each possible string. A case structure seems like the best option, with all the possible readouts as the cases. I did this and added  as the default case to send out a value for the nomatch case. The trouble is that if I wire the readout string to the case structure it always executes the default case no matter what the readout and yes, before anyone asks, I verified that the readout strings match my cases exactly. To check that the case structure was working I wired a constant to the case structure and it works fine, even when I copy and paste the value from the readout string to the constant. Also, I made sure that case insensitive matching was selected so thats not the issue. Anyone have an idea why this is happening I can post sample VIs if necessary.p

Now sometimes, strongnot systematicallystrong, in the serialization it throws the exceptionp  blockquote   pDecimal byte array constructor requires an array of length four containing valid decimal bytes.p blockquote  pRunning the same application with the same data, 3 times out of 5 it works. I enabled all the CLR exceptions, Debug  Exceptions  CLR Exception  Enabled, so I guess that if a wrong initializationassignment to decimal field occurs, the program should stop. It doesnt happen.br I tried to split serialization in more elementary objects but its very difficult, to try to identify the field causing problem. From the working version in production and this one I passed from .Net 3.5 to .NET 4.0 and consistent changes to the UI part, not the business part, have been made.

Negative 1074 pI have been forcing myself to get into more OOP. I have hated it all up in till now. When i am using some simple prepare statment in PDO within another class as a method it never works. I resolved it by doing the obvious globalising the PDO object into the method. It works, and does what i want  but if i had many many methods from loads of different classes, adding global db as the first line to alllll the functionsmethods it seems quite tedious. Is there a way of integrating PDO into all classes or at least each class instead of every single bloody methodp  pHeres a very very simple example of what what curretnly works, but as i said tediousp  precodeltphp  db  new PDOmysqlhostlocalhostdbnameblaa, blaa, blaa class test  function showcol, id     global db     result  dbgtprepareSELECT .col. FROM products WHERE id  id     resultgtexecutearrayidgtid     row  resultgtfetch     echo row[col]    show  new test showgtshowprice, 1 gt codepre  p..so i can use my PDO in the method show but if i were to add another method, i would have to put global db in it again... p  pSo how do i not globalise it in just a method, but instead, ALL CLASSES I tried inheriting the PDO class into the test class but that did not work I tried using a constructor likep  precodeltphp db  new PDOmysqlhostlocalhostdbnameblaa, blaa, blaa class test     public db function constructdb            thisgtdb  db      function showcol, id     result  dbgtprepareSELECT .col.

Negative 1074 pI saw two different ways to use member initializer lists. The first one is like thatp  precodeclass ClassName     public       argtype1 varName1       argtype2 varName2         Constructor.       ClassNameargtype1 argname1, argtype2 argname2        varName1argname1, varName2argname2                 codepre  pWhat is happening there is clear. In the constructor we have a list of arguments and we use them to initialize members of the class. For example codeargname1code is used to initialize value for the codevarName1code variable of the class.p  pAnother way to use the member initializer appears in the case of inheritancep  precodeclass ChildClass  public ParentClass        ChildClassstring name  ParentClass name                     What can we put here and why we might need it.         codepre  pWhat happens here is also clear. When we call the constructor of the codeChildClasscode with one string argument, it calls the constructor of the codeParentClasscode with the same string argument.p  pWhat is not clear to me, is how compiler distinguish these two cases the syntax is the same. For example, in the second example, compiler might think that it needs to take value of the codenamecode variable and assign it to the codeParentClasscode variable of the codeChildClasscode and then it sees that such a variable is not declared in the codeChildClasscode.p  pThe second unclear point to me is why we might want to put some content in the body of the constructor from the second example. Even of there is nothing it already creates and returns an object using the constructor of the parent class.p

Negative 1074 pThis seems like such an obvious question that Im absolutely certain its been asked before, but unfortunately set isnt a very good keyword for a search.p  pIm trying to define a model that uses a set datatype for one of its members  think hours of the day and days of the week.  Theres a very limited set of data that can be put in there, but you can select none or all of the possible values.  Something might be allowed on any day of the week, just weekends, or anything in between.  Edit  Technically I could manage this through a manytomany relationship and then adding the days of the week and hours of the day classes, but that seems rather absurd given that theyre so heavily fixed.  Making the client add hours of the day  days of the week to the system is silly, and they actually need to be fixed for consumers of relevant APIs to properly parse themp  pBut I cant figure out how to reproduce MySQLs set datatype in Django.p

Negative 1074 pWe are beginning a project to visualize the results of a finite volume FV calculation using Google Earth.  The FV data is essentially 2d latlong data consisting of a Cartesian array of values sea surface height, for example.  Each value should be mapped to a color from some colormap, and then displayed as a single mesh cell in a gridded array suitable for Google Earth.  The Cartesian array could be 100x100 or larger. p  pMy question is, do we construct polygons for each mesh cell Cij in the array, assigning a color corresponding to the qij value for that mesh cell  This would seem to create a huge KML file, if the coordinates of the four corners of every mesh cell must be described, i.e. 10,000 polygons, for example.  p  pOr are there KML tools we could use that would allow us to specify, for example, the lower and upper coordinates of the array, a generic mesh cell size e.g. dX, dY values, and the array of q data or, equivalently, colours that should be used to fill the patch   p  pAlternatively, we could create an image file, containing for example, a rendered image of our data array created by some other means, and then referenced from the KML file. p  pOur aim is to use PyKML for this project.p  pAny suggestions would be very helpful. p

Some of the test classes use the a hrefhttpjunit.sourceforge.netjavadocorgjunitrunnersParameterized.html relnofollowParameterized runnera, just in case that makes a difference.

These are modeled through Schemas in Mongoose and are stored in the MongoDB database. When a user visits the app, it serves all the HTML through Node.js and Express and Jade as templating engine. If the user then registers, Socket.io lets the server know a user register, that is then saved to the database and the user is joined in the lobby room. In this room, users can chat, listen to music, etc. This is what Ive been using Socket.io for, the communication between users themselves and my server the server sometimes serves html too through Socket.io. Basically all the messages between Socket.io and the server are really small chat messages, room objects, song objects, etc.p  pIm quite happy with this approach, however, on the client side, the code is not really separated. There are currently two JS files serving the logic. One handles the Socket.io events and manipulates the dom. The other one is a common JS file that does a bit of everything. These two files are now about 5000 lines each. This worries me and I want to find a solution for this in v2.p  pSo Ive been looking at AngularJS in the MEAN stack and how to incorporate it in my app. My question is, will this solve my client side problems and can would you recommend taking the effort to do so. Also, how well will Socket.io work with AngularJS Having both of them might be an overkill for what Im doing. Do you know of any possible other framework that might be easier to integrate with my current environment I know its a bit of a subjective question but if you have any tips or do or donts, thanks for sharing I really appreciate your feedback and if you need more information, Id be happy to share it with youp  pJordyp

The way I thought it worked is just making a custom JsonConverter, so I did thisp  precodeclass VectorConverter  JsonConverter      public override bool CanConvertType objectType              return objectType  typeofVector4           public override object ReadJsonJsonReader reader, Type objectType, object existingValue, JsonSerializer serializer              var obj  JToken.Loadreader         if obj.Type  JTokenType.Array                      var arr  JArrayobj             if arr.Count  4 ampamp arr.Alltoken gt token.Type  JTokenType.Float                              return new Vector4arr[0].Valueltfloatgt, arr[1].Valueltfloatgt, arr[2].Valueltfloatgt, arr[3].Valueltfloatgt                               return null           public override void WriteJsonJsonWriter writer, object value, JsonSerializer serializer              var vector  Vector4value         writer.WriteStartArray         writer.WriteValuevector.X         writer.WriteValuevector.Y         writer.WriteValuevector.Z         writer.WriteValuevector.W         writer.WriteEndArray       codepre  pNow, the Write part is pretty straight forward to me I think. When the serializer goes through objects, if it encounters one that the CanConvert method responds to with true, it lets my custom serializer to convert it to JSON. And that works.p  pWhat I dont really get is the other way. Since theres no way to know what type something is when its just written in literals in JSON, I thought I have to analyse the object myself and determine if its in fact the Vector object. The code Ive written works, but I dont know what to do if the check fails. How do I tell the deserializer that this isnt one of the objects that I know how to translate and that it should do its default thing on itp  pAm I missing something in how the whole thing worksp

Negative 1074 pIm perplexed about how best to use codepipcode in the face of security concerns about malicious packages or install scripts. Im not much of a security expert, so I may just be confused embear with meem, but it seems  that there are 4, possibly overlapping, approachesp  pstrong1 Use codesudo pipcode for everythingstrongp  pThis is how I do things now. I generally do not need virtualenvs and like the convenience of having all my packages work for all my tools. I also dont install a lot of experimental packages, sticking pretty much to the wellknown and widely used ones codematplotlibcode, codesixcode, etc.p  pI gather this can be a risky approach though because the installation process has codesucode privileges, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma21056000656912could potentially do anythinga however it has the advantage of protecting the codesitepackagescode directory from subsequent mischief by anything not just packages running as noncodesucode after an install.p  pThis approach also cant be completely avoided, as some packages codepipcode itself need it to bootstrap any Python installation.p  pstrong2 Create a codepipcode user and give it ownership of codesitepackagescodestrongp  pThis would a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma21056100656912seem to have the advantagea of restricting what codepipcode can do all it can do is install to codesitepackagescode. But Im not sure about side effects, or if it would even work when, for example codepipcode needs to put things in other locations. A more realistic variant of this is to set things up this way, and use codepipcode as pipuser when it works, and as codesucode when it doesnt.p  pstrong3 Give myself ownership of codesitepackagescodestrongp  pI gather a hrefhttpsuperuser.coma700093114642this is a very had ideaa, but Im not sure quite why. It would mean that any code I run would be able to tamper with codesitepackagescode but it would mean that malicious install scripts could only damage things I can damage myself anyway.p  pstrong4 Use a virtualenvstrongp  pThis suggestion comes up a lot, but I dont see how it helps. It seems no different from 3 to me since it creates a codesitepackagescode that I own.p  pWhich, if any of these approaches, or combinations of approaches, is best for ensuring that codepipcode does not result in exposing my system My concern is mostly with my system as a whole, and only secondarily with my Python installation in codesitepackagescode which I can always rebuild if need be.p  hr  pPart of the problem I have, is that a dont know how to weigh the risks. An example approach, that seems to make sense to my limited understanding is simply to do 1 for the most part, and use a virtualenv 4 for any package that I worry might damage my codesitepackagescode. Anything Ive installed will still be able to damage anything I have access to, but that seems unavoidable, and at least things I dont have access to will be safe except during the installation process itself. But I have trouble evaluating whether the protection this affords is worth the risk it creates.p

Negative 1074 pI have a form with two listboxes among other items. The items in the second listbox depend on the choice made in the first listbox.

When you load my page there is a blackscreen with a headline. Nothing else. when you scroll up the title should move up normaly until he reaches the top. when it reaches the top it gets the position fixed attribute. when you scroll down it gets the position relative attribute again. Nothing else should happen. But on mobiles the text scrolls up until the scrolling stops most of the time you scroll the text out of the screen and pop up on the fixed position.

Negative 1074 pSo im trying to improve performance in our ASP.Net Webforms application.p  pAs usual Postbacks do their best to slow down performance. Ive come to learn about WebMethod calls which i managed to get working too. However for my particular scenario i need to access the Session, which is obviously not possible in a static method.p  pSo now my idea was writing a HttpModule to solve this. However this seems like quite an effort, so i was wondering if any of you know about an out of the box solution for this taskp  pMind you, this is just a question about wether something already exists. Writing the module would be pretty straight forward. Id just like to avoid reinventing the wheel.p
Negative 1074 pIm trying to create a modal box that will allow the user to filter and search a grid.

I can click on the headers and it sorts, but typing in the search boxes under the headings does nothing. No errors are produced in JS, and it the spinner appears for a short while then disappears, but no actual filtering has occurred.p  pChanging the line in form top  precodeecho thisgtrenderPartialstudentsfind, arraymodelgtStudentsmodel,false,true codepre  pMakes a difference. The first thing I notice is that the JS for form is broken, because I use Select2 in form, and they do not load codeTypeError jQuery....select2 is not a functioncode. When I open the modal which renders the grid fine, and search, the spinner just keeps spinning and nothing happens. p  pChecking the console, I see the following errorp  precodetoo much recursion codepre  pChrome is more helpfulp  precodeUncaught RangeError Maximum call stack size exceeded  codepre  pAdding codeYiiappgtclientscriptgtscriptMap[.js]  falsecode to the modal just gets rid of emallem JS. However, looking at the network trace, it does look like my JS is being called twice. So it seems there may be a conflict of scriptsp  pThe next step would be to write this as a widget, but I am unsure how to do it. Perhaps AJAX would be the way to go, but I am unsure of how to proceed with that.p

Negative 1074 pI have a web app that consist of many rows. Each row has a label with 0 in it and a button. Pressing the button increments the label by 1.p  pThe app starts with only one row, but the user can add as many as they want.p  pAll of the values in the labels need to persist. So if a logged in user adds 10 rows, and presses the button on each row a few times, then next time they come back all of their values should have persisted. Herein lies the problem, as I am unsure of the most efficient way to save these values. p  pMy first thought was to do an AJAX call on click of each button, but if the user spams the button to get to a certain value then Ive made many superfluous calls. I could also save all rows every x seconds, but that could leave the user with incomplete data persistence if they alter a row and then leave before the next save triggers. I also thought of saving on unload, but that wont catch users who simply close their browsers or tab.p  pIm using MVC, Jquery, C, and MSSQL. My site and database live on the same server.p

Negative 1074 pAfter installing Delphi XE6 in a VM from the web, I noticed that the disk size had gone up much more that I would have expected, even after compacting  shrinking. As well what looks like a temporary downloads directory in my user tree with lots of .7zip files I found a much more obscure directory called on my machine A2C8EB76CB1E47B596A74FD682404E92 in CProgramData. This contained a huge 3.5GB of various DLLs etc. Some of these are language files but a test of deleting the entire directory appears to have no effect on normal use of Delphi.

Negative 1074 pI am aware that it is possible to permanently alter the prompt variable the command prompt that begins every command line, defaulting to the current drive and path, followed by a greater than sign  in the Command Prompt by adding an Environment Variable named Prompt and setting the value to that which can be set by running the codepromptcode command.p  pHowever, I am curious to know if it is possible to set the Window Title of the command prompt this is possible by running codetitle [insert value here]code, perhaps by setting a parameter in the cmd.exe file settings. Unfortunately I do not know if this is possible, and if so the correct syntax to get it to work. Hence my question here. I have looked in many places for an answer to this question, but I seemingly find only sites with details on command parameters being executed within the prompt itself.p

Negative 1074 pIm making a chrome extension that injects JavaScript into a certain forum website. The JavaScript uses jQuery to add a button to the webpage whenever youre viewing a profile on the forum. Theres a link already on every profile page that can show all of that profiles posts on the forum. The button added by jQuery by the chrome extension is supposed to use the show last posts link already on each profile page to scrape through all of a profiles last posts and find posts which are actually new topics and not just replies to other topics on the forum. The chrome extensions purpose is to display all of a profiles last topics.p  pThe problem is that the Node.js code that I use to scrape the webpages cant run in the context of a webpage. I think it doesnt work because it uses node modules request and cheerio, which dont have browserify support. p  pRight now I can only run the Node.js scraper by manually inserting into its code the link to the show last posts page that I want to be scraped and then executing it in my local command prompt. Theres two questions to all of thisp  ol lipHow do I make the Node.js scraper execute to run emout of the webpages contextem when someone clicks the button thats added by the chrome extensionpli lipHow do I send the show last posts link from the chrome extensions content script jQuery button to the scraper since the scraper cant run in the browser to grab the link itselfpli ol  pPlease provide a number before your answers so everyone can tell which questions youre answering.

Negative 1074 pIn my iOS 8 app, I have a custom codeUITableViewCellcode which is defined in a .xib file using autolayout.  I have set up the codeUITableViewcode so that it uses selfsizing cells, and that is all working just fine.p  pIn the .xib file for my cell, I have a design for the Any x Any size class, which works. I also wanted a different design for the Compact x Any size class, so I added that layout to my .xib.p  pWhen I run the app on an iPhone device real or simulator I find that the cell is always sized as if its using my Any x Any layout, and yet the content of the cell is always laid out as if its using my Compact x Any size class.  This happens regardless of orientation.p  pOn an iPad device real or simulator it always uses the Any x Any layout for sizing and layout, which I think is correct.p  pHas anybody else tried this and got it to work on an iPhone  It doesnt feel like what Im trying to do should be an unusual requirement.p  pIn summary, I think the layout is happening correctly on all devices, but the selfsizing cell logic appears not to respect the size class its in.p
Negative 1074 pWe use Eclipse Kepler IDE to develop our GWT app and have been using an Ant script to deploy to a Tomcat container for a long time.  We recently decided to switch to using a Hudson CI server in order to streamline the GWT compile and deploy process.  The problem we are encountering is that when we allow Eclipse to do its own continuous building, then perform the GWT compiledeploy, our app works as expected.  However, when we use an external javac process to compile, whether from a standalone JDK or using Eclipses compiler codeorg.eclipse.jdt.core.JDTCompilerAdaptercode, we receive the following error messagep  precodeError creating bean with name loginServiceImpl defined in file [opttomcatwebappsROOT10616WEBINFclassescomcompanyribeyeserverserviceLoginServiceImpl.class] Unsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor argument with index 0 of type [org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManager]  No unique bean of type [org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManager] is defined expected single matching bean but found 3 [org.springframework.security.config.authentication.AuthenticationManagerFactoryBean0, org.springframework.security.authentication.ProviderManager0, org.springframework.security.authenticationManager] nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException No unique bean of type [org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManager] is defined expected single matching bean but found 3 [org.springframework.security.config.authentication.AuthenticationManagerFactoryBean0, org.springframework.security.authentication.ProviderManager0, org.springframework.security.authenticationManager] codepre  pWe are not using any sort of dependency manager, yet Eclipse seems to handle the java compilation without issue and we dont encounter this error.  I want to stress this error only occurs when we compile using an Ant task and javac.  Again, even when using Eclipses own bundled compiler we have the problem.  I also want to add that I am not a Java developer but I am the DevOps manager for our development team, so the CI server and deploy strategy fall within my domain.

Negative 1074 pIn a C application I created a codeGridViewcode dynamically and exported it to Excel. The issue that I am having is that since three fields are Bit columns in SQL they export as checkboxes and not ones and zeros.

So there will never be more than one row.p  pAny ideasp  precodenamespace FormTest      public partial class About  Page              protected void PageLoadobject sender, System.EventArgs e                      tbl.BorderStyle  BorderStyle.Inset             tbl.BorderWidth  Unit.Pixel1          if Page.IsPostBack                      Session[count]  0                  else                      int count  intSession[count]             count             Session[count]  count                    protected void cmdCreateClickobject sender, System.EventArgs e              tbl.Controls.Clear          int rows  1         int cols  4          if intSession[count]  0                      for int i  0 i lt rows i                              TableRow rowNew  new TableRow                 tbl.Controls.AddrowNew                 for int j  0 j lt cols j                                      TableCell cellNew  new TableCell                     Label lblNew  new Label                     lblNew.Text    i.ToString  ,  j.ToString  ltbr gt                      TextBox tbNew  new TextBox                     cellNew.Controls.AddlblNew                     cellNew.Controls.AddtbNew                      rowNew.Controls.AddcellNew                                                else                      if intSession[count]  1                              for int i  0 i lt rows i                                      TableRow rowNew  new TableRow                     tbl.Controls.AddrowNew                     for int j  0 j lt cols j                                              TableCell cellNew  new TableCell                         Label lblNew  new Label                         lblNew.Text    i.ToString  ,  j.ToString  ltbr gt                          TextBox tbNew  new TextBox                         cellNew.Controls.AddlblNew                         cellNew.Controls.AddtbNew                          rowNew.Controls.AddcellNew                                                                else                              if intSession[count]  2                                      for int i  0 i lt rows i                                              TableRow rowNew  new TableRow                         tbl.Controls.AddrowNew                         for int j  0 j lt cols j                                                      TableCell cellNew  new TableCell                             Label lblNew  new Label                             lblNew.Text    i.ToString  ,  j.ToString  ltbr gt                              TextBox tbNew  new TextBox                             cellNew.Controls.AddlblNew                             cellNew.Controls.AddtbNew                              rowNew.Controls.AddcellNew                                                                                else                                      if intSession[count]  3                                              for int i  0 i lt rows i                                                      TableRow rowNew  new TableRow                             tbl.Controls.AddrowNew                             for int j  0 j lt cols j                                                              TableCell cellNew  new TableCell                                 Label lblNew  new Label                                 lblNew.Text    i.ToString  ,  j.ToString  ltbr gt                                  TextBox tbNew  new TextBox                                 cellNew.Controls.AddlblNew                                 cellNew.Controls.AddtbNew                                  rowNew.Controls.AddcellNew                                                                                                else                                              Response.Redirecthttpwww.google.co.uk                                                                  end cmdCreateClick   codepre

Negative 1074 pI keep running into cases where it would be helpful to be able to list handle lists of all the members of an instance of my FlaskSQLAlchemy model data, or to be able to use such instances as iterables or lists of values.

It seems like this sort of thing should be built in somewhere and that Im just missing it.p  pIs there a better approach to treating model instances i.e. data rows as lists Does my approach even achieve the desired result reliably e.g., I think codecolumns.data.keyscode only works if my Models members have the same names as the tables columns. p

Negative 1074 pIm having a strange problem in my Rails 4 application in that Im trying to create an association on a join table, and its not recognizing the controller correctly. For example, I have this form in the show view for a coursep  precodeltform actionltcoursesstudentsurlgt methodpostgt   ltinput typehidden nameenrollment[userid] valuelt currentuser.id gtgt   ltinput typehidden nameenrollment[courseid] valuelt course.idgtgt   ltinput typesubmit valueEnroll in Classgt ltformgt      codepre  pI omitted the formauth for clarity.p  pAfter clicking on Enroll in Class, Im greeted with an error codeuninitialized constant CoursesstudentsControllercode. However, the controller I want, codeCoursesStudentsControllercode IS defined I can call that variable when the error in bound but its not being recognized. Im seeing the problem is with a variable called codecontrollerclassnamescode, which has the following propertiesp  precodeltThreadSafeCache0x007f350140c350  backendcoursesstudentsgtCoursesstudentsController, defaultprocnilgt codepre  pwhich of course is incorrect.p  pNow, I am thinking that this came about because I stupidly ran coderails g controller Coursesstudentscode without any capitalization after making my model, and I tried to fix my mistake by just manually renaming the files. Right now, my model is CoursesStudents in codecoursesstudents.rbcode and the controller is CoursesStudentsController in codecoursesstudentscontroller.rbcodep  pThe funny this is, when I simply used the buttonto shortcut with the same url helper it worked, but going forward I dont want to use rails shortcuts for this project. Ive also tried to set the controller name in the route, but it just tells me that its not a supported controller namep  pMy only fix now is to give in to rails demands and make the controller name lowercase, which although it works, I still want to know if theres any internal configuration I can change, or whether Im naming anything wrong. If anything though, Ive learned a better respect for the rails naming conventions.p

Negative 1074 pI was trying to install a new Python package specifically, a relatively new machine learning package called pylearn2 on my Windows 7 machine with Visual Studio 2008. Its a package not on PyPI, so I got its source and installed it by calling setup.py install. p  pAt some point during the installation, Visual Studio linker was used and encountered error 1104. Apparently, the linker cannot handle pathnames with spaces in them, but my Python is installed in a directory with spaces in its name.p  pThis seems to be a problem that could be common to when installing some other packages. I was wondering if theres a solution to this or perhaps just some workround.p  pThanks.p
Negative 1074 pSay I have an codeorderscode table and a codeuserscode table and a codeguestscode table, for a company who accept orders from both codeuserscode and codeguestscode.p  pI also have a codeisguestcode boolean on the codeorderscode table which lets me know quickly whether the order has been made by a guest or a registered user.p  pI have a model method called codecustomercode which returns the eloquent relation like sop  precodepublic function customer    return thisgtisguest  thisgtbelongsToGuest, userid  thisgtbelongsToUser, userid  codepre  pThis works very well when I pass codeorderscode to the view and access the customers data like sop  precode Maps to either ordergtusergtfirstname OR ordergtguestgtfirstname echo ordergtcustomergtfirstname codepre  pBut when I try to use this functionality when using eager loading it doesnt quite workp  precodeorders  Orderwithcustomergtget return Responsemakeorders codepre  pIt only returns the eager loaded customer data for strongeither the codeusercode or the codeguestcodestrong and never both.p  pIm wondering why this is and how to get round itp  pIs it because of the way the eager loading works  it only calls the codecustomercode method emonceem just as it only hits the database once, so whatever the first result of the query is, it will use that to determine the rest of the query toop  pIf I am trying to get a JSON response of all the codeordercode data emwithem all of the customers details too, how would I do thatp  pThanks.p  h1UPDATEh1  pYes, turns out I was abusing the Laravel relationship method by adding a condition. Using the polymorphic relations is a much better approach as suggested by lukasgeiter. a hrefhttplaravel.comdocs4.2eloquentpolymorphicrelations relnofollowhttplaravel.comdocs4.2eloquentpolymorphicrelationsap  pI did have trouble loading other relations embased on the polymorphic relationem. For example if both codeUsercode and codeGuestcode had corresponding tables codeUserDetailcode and codeGuestDetailcode then I couldnt get the eager loading to work. So I added this to both the codeUsercode and codeGuestcode modelsp  precodeprotected with  [detail] codepre  pThis means that whenever the codecustomercode polymorphic relation is eager loaded, then both codeUsercode and codeGuestcode will load their relationships automatically.

Essentially, I want the program to loop through the text file and match words found in Python dictionaries and associate them with a category and keep track of it in a list. p  pSo for example, lets say I was parsing through the file and I ran across the word ADD. ADD is listed under the math or 0 category of words. The program should then add it to a list that it ran across a 0 category and then continue to parse the file. Essentially generating a large list that looks like [0,4,6,7,4,3,4,1,2,7,1,2,2,2,4...] with each of the numbers corresponding to a particular state or category of words as illustrated above. For the sake of understanding, well call this large list statelistp  pAs you can tell from my code, so far I can take as input the file to analyze, take and store the text files that contain the list of words into arrays and from there into dictionaries with their correct corresponding list value a numerical value from 1  7. However, Im having trouble with the analysis portion.p  pAs you can tell from my code, Im trying to go line by line through the text file and regex any of the found words with the dictionaries. This is done through a loop and regexing with an additional, 9th dictionary that is more or less a super dictionary to help simplify the parsing. p  pHowever, Im having trouble matching all the words in the file and when I find the word, matching it to the dictionary value, not the key. That is when it runs across and ADD to add 0 to the list because it is a part of the 0 or math category. p  pWould someone be able to help me figure out how to write this script I really appreciate it Sorry for the long post, but the code requires a lot of explanation so you know whats going on. Thank you so much in advance for your helpp

Negative 1074 pId like to make certain components of my program themeable by the user such that they can edit values in a settings user interface, such as background color, stroke, or size, and those changes will be reflected once they use that component in the software.p  pThe solution would be simple if the values being changed were always the same, but they are not, as different components may have different themeable properties.p  pI would like to abstract this solution so that a themeable component can either extend a parent Component class who will have the property changing functionality.p  pMy current idea is to create an abstract property class with an update method that returns a boolean and takes a String. For example, if someone was themeing a button, it may have a border property. The update method is defined such that it knows how to update the border based on a String, and the user would be interacting with a UI that knows what Strings to provide based on user input.p  precodepublic abstract class XProperty      public abstract boolean updateString info  codepre  pIm sure there is a better or more simple way of doing this.

Negative 1074 pIm a relatively okish programmer, but my main focus has been in application development with C so far. I have almost zero experience with game development and 3d engines  Ive begun reading up on how 3d Engines work in general, e.g. there was a wonderful guide explaining how to develop a very simple softwarebased 3D engine in C. Very helpful, but that pretty much summarizes my whole experience with the topic. Also, I havent really been working with C much so far even though Im aware of the basic conceptual differences to C, and would consider getting up to at least sufficient speed in that language manageable.p  pSo anyway, out of pure personal interest, Id like to play around with developing  or rather, learning how to develop  simple DirectXbased 3d Graphics Engines for educational purposes. Im simply interested in the graphics parts no soundanimationgame statesnetworking or whatever, only very rudimentary input. Rendering some simple geometry, and then progressively learning how to extend this with more modern shading techniques would be fine.p  pIve already found some great resources for this. But before I dig into the topic I know DirectX12 is around the corner, and seeing how much it seems to evolve the system, Im really not sure if there are going to be many breaking changes to the API. Or in other words Im afraid that I start learning DirectX 11 stuff now, and in a few months from now itll all be useless as DirectX 12 works in a significantly different way, from a programming point of view.p  pIm not sure how much of this is already known, or if there are developer previous available to the broader public already. But if its possible to tell already Would you guys recommend me waiting for DX12, or start with v11 as development will be very similar in the future anywayp  pFor the record, I know of course that learning DX11 wont hurt in any case. But Im not in a rush, and if half of what Id be learning now becomes obsolete in a few months, Id prefer just waiting until then to slowly get started.p

Negative 1074 pIs it right to say that interface communicates between two classes Like it can send information from class B to class C both classes inherits same interface.p  pthis example I read p  blockquote   plets take your hand as an example. The hand is a class. Your body has two objects of the type hand, named left hand and right hand. Their main functions are controlled or managed by a set of electrical signals sent through your shoulders through an interface. So the shoulder is an interface that your body uses to interact with your hands. The hand is a wellarchitected class. The hand is being reused to create the left hand and the right hand by slightly changing the properties of it.p blockquote  pthis only specifies that interface control or manages class, I agree with this point but somehow I came to know that interface can transfer data from one class to another, So is it correct if we define interface like this or strongsay that we use interface for this purposestrongp  blockquote   pInterface creates communication between two classes, for example Interface Iabc inherited in ClassA and ClassB then it can send information of ClassA to ClassB.p blockquote  precodepublic interface  Interface1      void  Method1string msg      void Method2string msg1 ,string msg2   public static class  HelperClass        public static void Method1Interface1 obj ,string msg                obj.Method1msg             public static void Method2Interface1 obj,string msg1, string msg2                obj.Method2msg1,msg2           static void Mainstring[] args              var Car  new Vehcile         var HS  new Person         Car.per Car Clss         HS.per  HS Clss         HelperClass.Method1Car, Car.per         HelperClass.Method1HS, HS.per         HelperClass.Method2Car, Car.per, HS.per         HelperClass.Method2HS, HS.per, Car.per         Console.ReadKey            public class Person  Interface1        public String per       void Interface1.Method1string msg              Console.WriteLinemsg           void Interface1.Method2string msg1, string msg2              Console.WriteLinePerson Class  msg1     msg2         class Vehcile  Interface1      public String per       void Interface1.Method1string msg              Console.WriteLinemsg           void Interface1.Method2string msg1, string msg2              Console.WriteLineVehcile Class  msg1     msg2       codepre

Accept Client Connection... If client connection is Valid then Create and detach a thread of the exact same function. Else Keep on listening... codepre  pI detach the threads only because afterwards, the thread who created a certain thread is handling a client, if that client leaves all clients that logged in after that client would be forced to log out because theres a chain of threadsp  precodegt means creating a thread Listening thread...

Negative 1074 pI am currently programming a multiplayer game, and I am working on the networking side of it all right now. I have a packet system set up, and the way it works with Strings at least is that it takes a number of characters to a maximum of X characters. The characters are converted to bytes for sending to the server. If there are less than X characters, then the remaining bytes are set to 0. The issue is that when processing this information on the server and converting it to a string, the 0byte characters are a  in my console, and invisible in my JTextPane. How can I remove all of these 0byte characters from the String in a clean way Id prefer not to have another loop and more variables just to remove the 0bytes before converting to a String.

To do this I am tracking two things, their current checkpoint count the number of checkpoints they have passed through I then check the distance between each car and the next checkpoint they are heading towards.p  pWhen the check position function is called every second the cars number of checkpoints are placed in an array so [0] in the array will be car1 etc and the distance from each car and the next checkpoint they are heading to is also in an array so [0] would be car1s distance to their next checkpoint.p  pWhat I need is a way to sort the two arrays in tandem so that they still relate to the same car when i access an element from either, the problem however is I seem to be stuck, Ive used Array.Sort, and placed the two in there so that they align but say I have 3 cars on 2 checkpoints and the rest on 1 the cars with 2 checkpoints are not sorted by distance.p  pIs there anything you guys can think of that can fix this. Ive tried to avoid using getcomponent etc so ive made the position script access static variables that relate to each individual cars number of checkpoints and distance to next CP, therefore I tried to avoid classes and what not.p  pI feel like Im 80 of the way there so its annoying asking for help.p

Negative 1074 pAs the title says.p  pHistory To reduce flicker in my ListBox with codeDrawMode.OwnerDrawFixedcode and a custom OnDrawItem I used the subclassing example from this page a hrefhttpyacsharpblog.blogspot.no200807listboxflicker.html relnofollowhttpyacsharpblog.blogspot.no200807listboxflicker.htmla which uses codeSetStyleControlStyles.OptimizedDoubleBuffer  ControlStyles.AllPaintingInWmPaint  ControlStyles.UserPaint, truecodep  pIt works well except for one thing When I scroll sideways to see long strings the OnDrawItem does not seem to understand that it should draw with an offset. It seems like the horizontal scroll offset is lost somewhere on the way and the area OnPaint has been called to fill in gets filled in by my OnDrawItem as if the ListBox was not scrolled sideways at all.p  pPlease note If I disable codeControlStyles.UserPaintcode and let the system call OnDrawItem directly, it works fine and I can scroll sideways normally. But it flickers and is too slow to be useful. I need the custom OnPaint and the codeControlStyles.OptimizedDoubleBuffercode to make it smooth.p  pCan someone tell me wherehow to get the horizontal scroll position, or what needs to be done to make this happen automatically, like when the system calls OnDrawItemp

Negative 1074 pI have around 30 OpenWRT access points in our building plenty of them are old Linksys. Its time to update wireless network. Some of old APs will be replaced with TP Link Archos. Problem is that maintain 30 access points is quite quite time consuming if you want to change passwords, you have to do this on each access point. Solution is to use wireless controller. And here is my question. Which one do you suggest me I found only OpenWISP, but the documentation is rather poor.p  pThanksp

Negative 1074 pThis question has to do with a game console Im working on, and right now I am trying to write a Java program to simulate the consoles DSP. That way, I know exactly what to do when I port it to actual hardware. But I am having trouble finding the right sound library. What I need is basically this I have my own sound format, and I feed it into the DSP. It then decodes the data, processes post decode effects echo, amplify, etc., and splits the results into two sound waves for stereo output. I have everything planned out except a way to get my sound waves to my computers sound card. So basically a more advanced version of a sine wave generator. And a little code sample to get me started would help. If I need to clarify anything, than let me know.p  pEDIT Okay, so just to be clear the sound wave data will be stored in chunks in a byte array. So I need a way of playing sounds from there. And I dont want to dump the audio to a file and then play the file, that would take too long.p

Negative 1074 pI am using DeviceIoControl in Windows to send IOCTLSCSIPASSTHROUGHDIRECT commands in order to issue SCSI inqueries for reading specific pages on physical hard disk devices with vendorspecific data.  Disks are discovered by using QueryDosDeviceA and looking for PhysicalDrive entries.  Each disk then has the standard inquiry page read, possibly followed up by 25 additional pages read depending on the vendor and device id.p  pOccasionally, one of these queries seems to deadlock.  This occurs in a singlethreaded environment.  During testing, it SEEMED to always occur on the same device, but that could easily be coincidence.  I also noticed occasional IO failures on this specific device and other devices that did not cause deadlocks.p  pI am able to reproduce this fairly easily by just brute forcing several reads of the disks over and over.  The failure appears to occur directly after a standard inquiry query fails other page inquiry failures dont seem to cause the problem.  That is, if a standard inquiry fails, the next time a standard inquiry is issued to the same device in question using a new handle, a deadlock occurs.  p  pThis deadlock is SYSTEM WIDE and has been observed on more than one machine.  The only thing that seems to be able to resolve it is a rebootp  ol liTrying to send a standard inquiry to the device that deadlocked in DeviceIoControl will deadlock on any additional processes once the initial deadlock occurs.  li liThe process cannot be killed in task manager.li liThe process cannot be killed in an elevated command prompt with taskkill F though taskkill F will say it succeeded, it does not.li liAttaching in a debugger to the process in question states that the process appears deadlocked, and points to the DeviceIoControl call.li ol  pHere is example code for a page readp  precodepragma pack1 define SCSIRESPONSELENGTH 255 struct SCSIRESPONSE      unsigned char ucaResponse[SCSIRESPONSELENGTH]    define SCSISENSEBUFFERLENGTH 32 struct SCSISENSEBUFFER      unsigned char ucaSense[SCSISENSEBUFFERLENGTH]  pragma pack  define SCSICDBOPCODEIDX                     0 define SCSICDBINQUIRYFLAGSIDX              1 define SCSICDBINQUIRYPAGEIDX               2 define SCSICDBINQUIRYSUBPAGEIDX           3  Response size MSB for some operations. define SCSICDBINQUIRYRESPONSESIZELSBIDX  4 define SCSICDBINQUIRYTERMINATORIDX         5  define SCSIOPCODEINQUIRY 0x12 define SCSIINQUIRYCMDLENGTH 6 define SCSIVPDFLAG 0x01 define SCSICDBTERMINATOR 0x00  struct SCSIPASSTHROUGHDIRECTWITHBUFFER       SCSIPASSTHROUGHDIRECT    sptd      Passthrough data contains CDB.     unsigned long               ulFiller  Realign buffer to DWORD boundary.

Negative 1074 pI am very new to this forum and am basically a Network Engineer learning Python to automate some tasks and make my work more efficient. Well, straight to the point. I have a big excel workbook of 4 sheets with around 50K rows in each sheet. After learning for couple of weeks and extensive search I was able to load the whole excel cell values in a nested list e.g. p  precodelist [sheetindex][rowindex][columnindex].  codepre  pNow after getting the inputs, next part is manipulation of those data. My task is to find specific column value from each row and search in the entire workbook and if found, corresponding data from a different column should be written in line with the original searched object. p  pMy method is like belowp  blockquote   pGetting the cell values in a big list as I mentioned earlier   flatten that list in a different variable as a one dimensional list.   in a loop, get the specific value from a row fixed column and search in entire onedimensional list, if found, write the corresponding value in a different excel file. p blockquote  pSo far, this method is working fine with a extra long delay which was the motivation for drifting from Excel VBA program to Python.

Negative 1074 pI am trying to use the Fuel UX wizard control, along with Bootstrap. However, since I am using also Bootstraps datepicker there seems to be a conflict involved in using the datepicker from one and the other library, since both define with .fn.datepicker the same name for the datepicker jQuery plugin.p  pAn obvious solution for me would be to only enable the Fuel UX controls I really need to use.

Negative 1074 pBefore I ask my question let me state that I DID look online, and I DID look on stack overflow for this question and DID find certain solutions but none of what I found worked for me. So I am asking here to hopefully get an answer to this question and appreciate any help given. p  pI am doing a Form post to an external website. In my model I created all the values by doing the following in my LoginViewModelp  precodepublic string returnurl  get set  codepre  pIn my constructor i set the values needed like sop  precodereturnurl  www.retururl.com codepre  pIn my index page I to the post like so using Razor in MVC 4.0p  precodeusing Html.BeginFormnull, null, FormMethod.Post, new  id  myForm, action  Model.loginUrl      Html.HiddenFormodel gt model.returnurl  codepre  pWhen I check on fiddler it does the following behind the scenesp  precodeltinput idreturnurl namereturnurl typehidden valuewww.returnurl.comgt codepre  pIt makes the input id AND name the name of the variable returnurl. p  pMy problem is that one of the name values in my form post MUST be bbpost. I obviously can not name a variable bbpost in my loginViewModel so what I tried was just setting the name to something like bbpost then in my index page.p  pstrongSo i did the followingstrongp  precodeHtml.HiddenFormodel gt model.bbpost, new  name  bbpost  codepre  pbut this did not work, when i checked fiddler it did the followingp  precodeltinput idbbpost namebbpost typehidden value gt codepre  pstrongI also tried thisstrongp  precodeHtml.HiddenFormodel gt model.bbpost, new  name  bbpost  codepre  pbut got thisp  precodeltinput idbbpost namebbpost typehidden value gt codepre  pstrongAnd finally tried thisstrongp  precodeHtml.HiddenFormodel gt model.bbpost, new  Name  bbpost  codepre  pbut got thisp  precodeltinput Namebbpost idbbpost namebbpost Namebbpost  typehidden value gt codepre  pUsing the capital name as so Name gives me two name values. This is not what I am looking for. p  pI DO realize that I can just write it this way directly in to the htmlp  precodeltinput idbbpost namebbpost typehidden value gt codepre  pBut in order to keep it all the looking the same I was hoping there was a way to keep this formatp  precodeHtml.HiddenFormodel gt model.bbpost, new  Name  bbpost  codepre  pThank you.p  pstrongEditstrong I did find the answer in the Question that was recommended but the accepted answer was not correct. I must have not looked further than the accepted answer by mistake I usually do and apologize. But the following is what worked if someone else accidentally skips the answer to this for going by the accepted answer which is WRONG because it generates TWO name values.  This was the correct answerd and what worked for mep  precode Html.Hiddenbbpost, Model.bbpost, new  idbbpost  codepre  pThanks.p
Negative 1074 pIs there any way to render a layer hosting NSView as it appears onscreen to a PDF or bitmap file emwithoutem implementing each CALayers codedrawInContextcode method or similarly, each layers delegates codevoiddrawLayerinContextcode method I just want the contents of the NSView exactly as they appear with minimal extra drawing code.p  pIve read numerous sources that say that to render to a PDF, you have to implement codedrawInContextcode, which makes sense if youre dealing with a custom layer subclass otherwise, how else would it know what to draw, but I want to render layers that just work when you add them to a view, such as CATextLayer or CAShapeLayer. It seems completely redundant to have to rewrite the code for a CATextLayer telling it how to draw itself when its clearly fully capable of doing that to the screen.p  pHave I missed something obviousp

Negative 1074 pI need to create word and excel documents on the fly. I have done some research and everything seems to point at OpenXML SDK. The good way to get code required for document generation is to create document in desired format and open it in Open XML SDK Productivity Tools. However the code generated from the tool needs to be refactored heavily and it is time consuming to remove sections that are not being used at all. Is there any way we can get optimized code out of that tool Are there any useful resource which provide step by step guide on how to create desired word and excel documents May be from templatesp

I dont want to change around my whole code and mess with the scope.  Is there a way to declare these same variables and have it look more efficientprofessionalp  precodeint numPlain int numPepperoni int pizzasOrdered  0 int slicesOrdered  0 int charmsOrdered  0 int totalSlices  0 int totalCharms  0 int totalPlain  0 int totalPepperoni  0 double plainCost  0.0 double pepperoniCost  0.0 double sliceCost  0.0 double pieCost  0.0 double charmCost  0.0 boolean flag  true double totalCost  0.00 double paymentAmt  0.0 int numPies  0 codepre
Negative 1074 pWhat woudl be a simple way to reduce a string like codeAAA111BBB222333444CCC555code to a dictionary in Swift.

Negative 1074 pIm working within CMS Made Simple, part of which is a portfolio page which uses jQuery Shuffle to arrange and filter the options.p  pWhen you click on a portfolio item it takes you to a detail page, when you return to the portfolio I want the filtered items to still display.p  pI think the best way to do this is to use shuffles options and a Smarty variable passed from the URL.

Negative 1074 pI apologize if this has already been asked but Ive done quite a bit of searching and have not been able to find a question that is similar to mine yet.p  pOn my application I have a password change page that triggers if a person is a new user or had hisher password reset. p  pThe issue is that once the user makes changes and hits submit heshe gets redirected to the main page.  Now if the user spams the back button a few times to get to the password change page they encounter an expired page and they can hit refresh. Then the browser asks the user to retry to submit the data.  This submit request is a POST and the original data that the user entered previously can be seen in the packet.p  pIve only been able to replicate this issue on IE so far..tried it on FF and Chrome but nothing there.p  pMy question is, is there a way, using jQuery, HTML, WSS, or otherwise to prevent this POST from being resubmitted  My biggest concern is the packet with the data that can be seen.p  pThanks.p
