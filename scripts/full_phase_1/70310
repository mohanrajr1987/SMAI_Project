Positive 70310 pI have a bird script taken from the project three.js. Now, theres the issue There are so many birds flying around, its not realistic anymore. I have tried to adjust many options but I cant seem to find the right one.

Positive 70310 pHello fellow programmers. I am currently making a webpage with the a hrefhttpmrdoob.github.iothree.jsexamplescanvasgeometrybirds.html relnofollowthree.js 3D library birdsa. However, I cant seem to get these two things right.p  p1 When you load the page, you can see the birds are all going to the center of the page. I want it to have it like a hrefhttpwww.thewildernessdowntown.com relnofollowhttpwww.thewildernessdowntown.coma here are the birds coming from the sides of your screen. How can I do thisp  p2 a hrefhttpwww.thewildernessdowntown.com relnofollowhttpwww.thewildernessdowntown.coma also have the birds flying in large groups. The original script does not have this. How can I create it so they all fly in large groupsp  pThank you for your answers in advancep

With some work, I had it loading the video on mobile, but it crashed Safari on my iPad Mini 1 in seconds.

Even dropping the refresh rate to 10 frames per second crashed all mobile devices I tested with pretty quickly.p  pMy next thought was to just load a bunch of lower res html5 videos as individual videos and play them simultaneously, but I quickly realized iOS isnt doesnt allow more than one HTML5 video to be playing at once . p  pMy next thought is to have one video and then accompanying gifs.

Positive 70310 pIm using CSS to try and create a label which is a popup that always remains on the map attached to a circle. The following link will lead to the image of what Im trying to do a hrefhttpimgur.comPYpX6Xb relnofollowImagea. In order to achieve this Ive been using the following code p  precode  popup.container.firstChild.css                 background webkitradialgradient29px  percentZoom  , circle closestcorner, rgba0, 0, 0, 0 0, rgba0, 0, 0, 0 58px, white 59px              codepre  pBefore, I was calculating the percentZoom depending on the radius of the circle and the zoom where the map is now. p  precodevar percent  50  presentCircleRadius  300000 when the radius is 300000 the percentage should be 50 var percentZoom  percent  zoom  6  then calculate it the exact zoom that should be used depending on the zoom. Being 6 the default one. codepre  pThis didnt work or it had many issues when I zoomed in on the map considering that the circle doesnt really change but the curvature seems to becoming flatter.p  pI tried using canvas as well to get the result that I wanted it, but I had issues. I was using two arches to build the top part and the bottom part, then thought about using two rectangles to create the two parts to the right of the circle. The problem with this its that the circle is transparent and its meant to start on the edge of it, if I used this solution the rectangle would appear in the middle of the circle.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecode  var canvas  document.getElementByIdmyCanvas1   var context  canvas.getContext2d   var x  canvas.width  2   var y  canvas.height  2   var radius  75   var startAngle  1.1  Math.PI   var endAngle  1.9  Math.PI   var counterClockwise  false    context.beginPath   context.arcx, y, radius, 1.6  Math.PI, 0  Math.PI, counterClockwise   context.lineWidth  15     line color   context.strokeStyle  black   context.stroke    context.beginPath   context.arcx, y, radius, 0  Math.PI, 0.4  Math.PI, counterClockwise   context.lineWidth  15     line color   context.strokeStyle  red   context.stroke    context.beginPath   context.lineWidth  10   context.strokeStyle  blue   context.rectx, y  radius, 150, radius   context.strokecodepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltcanvas idmyCanvas1 width578 height250gtltcanvasgtcodepre div div p  pSo I thought of using lines instead of rectangles to create the right part of the label a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net59syjvnk3 relnofollowfiddlea, the problem with this solution is, as mention before, as you zoom the curvature will change and I found no way to calculate exactly where the lines on the top and on the bottom should start.p  pIs there a way to do what I want to do Make it so that the label follows the curvature of the circle as you zoom in and out and if so how can I make it so considering that there might be more than one circle per zoom with different radiusp
Positive 70310 pi have predefined times stored in an array. i wrote a for loop to go threw an array and take snapshots from canvas and append them to a div  via onclick event. The problem is that i can only get the last snapshot unless i put an alert between snapshots. I tried using a seeked listener ,setting a timeout and I tried putting the snapshot function in a while loop waiting on a variable to change but i can only get the last timestamp in the array to take a snapshot unless there is an alert or confirm in the loop. p  pa hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpengaMbxp relnofollowCodepin Exampleap  pHTML p  precode    ltdiv idDesiredvideoPlayer gt      ltbrgt  ltvideo muted controls  idvideoPlayer stylefloat leftgt          ltsource idcurrentVID srchttphtml5multimedia.comcodech9mediaelephantsdreammedium.mp4 gt ltvideogt ltbrgt     ltdiv idPreCHPscrollgtArray snaps     ltdivgt      ltdiv idsnapshotscrollgtManual Snaps     ltdivgt     ltdivgtltinput typecheckbox idAlertsgt alert between snapshotsltdivgt     ltdivgt ltbutton idsnap onclickPreCHpsgtSnapshots from arrayltbuttongt ltbutton idsnap onclicksnapgtTake Snapshotltbuttongt codepre  pCSSp  precodevideo, canvas      border1px solid 000  DesiredvideoPlayer     backgroundcolorgrey     width 100     heightauto     height100     display block     display inlineblock  PreCHPscroll      outline 1px solid steelblue     width auto     height120px     overflowx auto     overflowy hidden     whitespace nowrap     fontsize 0px  snapshotscroll      outline 1px solid steelblue     width auto     height120px     overflowx auto     overflowy hidden     whitespace nowrap  .snapshots      width 200px     height 100px     border 1px solid white     display inlineblock  codepre  pJAVACRIPTp  precodevar CHPcategoryALL  [5,63,264,348,479,512,551,600] function PreCHps      scrollDIV  PreCHPscroll      ifdocument.getElementByIdvideoPlayer.readyState gt 4          document.getElementByIdvideoPlayer.addEventListenerseeked, ready2snap       for i  0 i lt CHPcategoryALL.length i   toggle alert       if document.getElementByIdAlerts.checked  true     alertsnapshot  snapcount       toggle alert          setTimeoutnext, 1500              setTimeoutchpThumbsMade, 1500        function next document.getElementByIdvideoPlayer.currentTime CHPcategoryALL[i]  function chpThumbsMade     scrollDIV  snapshotscroll document.getElementByIdvideoPlayer.removeEventListenerseeked, ready2snap   function ready2snap     scrollDIV  PreCHPscroll     snap    snap shot script  var w  200, h  100, snapcount  0, scrollDIV  snapshotscroll function snap       snapcount  snapcount1         var snapnum  snapshot  snapcount     alertsnapnum      make new div     var newsnap  document.createElementdiv     newsnap.id   snapnum     newsnap.className  snapshots     var scrollDIV  scrollDIV      document.getElementByIdscrollDIV.appendChildnewsnap       var crrntTsec  document.getElementByIdvideoPlayer.currentTime     var clckFnct  document.getElementByIdvideoPlayer.currentTime  crrntTsec      document.getElementByIdsnapnum.setAttributeonclick, clckFnct      var cv  document.createElementcanvas     cv.width  w     cv.height  h            Get timestamp     var Tsec  Math.floordocument.getElementByIdvideoPlayer.currentTime            convert to time stamp     var hour  Math.floorTsec  3600     var min  Math.floorTsec  60     var secs  Tsec  min  60      hour  hour gt 10  hour  0  hour     min  min gt 10  min  0  min     secs  secs gt 10  secs  0  secs     var Tstamp  hour  min  secs        document.getElementByIdsnapnum.appendChildcv     var cx  cv.getContext2d     cx.fillRect0, 0, w, h        Grab the image from the video     cx.drawImagedocument.getElementByIdvideoPlayer, 0, 0, w, h          cx.font  12pt Calibri           cx.strokeStyle40FF00         cx.strokeTextTstamp, 5, 95         cx.strokeTextTstamp, 6, 96         cx.strokeTextTstamp, 6, 97         cx.strokeTextTstamp, 7, 95    cx.fillStyle  000000    cx.fillTextTstamp, 6, 96       document.getElementByIdscrollDIV.scrollLeft   5000          codepre  pa hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpengaMbxp relnofollowCodepen exampleap

My solutions was to get DATAURL when capture or select image and generate text file which contains all base64 of the images and save url of that text file in database. So when I call particular report it would read from database location of the text file and read content and use base64 for adding images using jsPDF. Not optimal but working given the limitations. I leave it here, for future reference if it helps to someone.p

Positive 70310 pI have 3 Layers and 3 Group  Small and 2 Big . On click to any Wedge of Smaller Circle Group , The respective bigger Circle is shown. I Have made changes to resize the canvas Groups and its wedges. But its only getting reflected for the inner Circle. JS fiddle.  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netvtankaria6oy5q5s5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netvtankaria6oy5q5s5a The outer Circle and Its Wedge radius is assigned and visible in DOM of Outer circle object, But browser doesnt behave with that value. For inner circle the value gets assigned and is reflected as well in behavior. For outer circle Radius given while creating the circle is 300 while we resize the radius gets calculated and is assigned. Check the console output in Image attached. The value appears to be 262. Any reason Why is the browser not able to behave that way   a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comxK0jH.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxK0jH.png altenter image description hereap  precodevar

Positive 70310 pRecently a Chrome extension our company uses was reported to be causing extreme slow down in the UI when in use. Ive been trying to find the cause of this issue.p  pAfter a week or two I have narrowed it down to the canvass drawImage method.p  pInitial thought was that this method was holding onto the thread for too long.p  pThis extension works great up to Chrome V43 couldnt find chrome V44 anyway. With the current version 45, it causes heavy delay on UI response. Seems like a chrome bug.p  pGoogling around I found this a hrefhttpscode.google.compchromiumissuesdetailcan2ampstart0ampnum100ampqampcolspecID20Pri20M20Stars20ReleaseBlock20Cr20Status20Owner20Summary20OS20Modifiedampgroupbyampsortampid490478 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compchromiumissuesdetailcan2ampstart0ampnum100ampqampcolspecID20Pri20M20Stars20ReleaseBlock20Cr20Status20Owner20Summary20OS20Modifiedampgroupbyampsortampid490478ap  pI am not sure if this is exactly the issue I am running into with drawImage but taking the suggestion from someone who posted there, I went into chromeflags and disabled Disable accelerated 2D canvas. p  pThis instantly solved the issue amp the extension is actually working better than ever before. The question is why and how can this be used to make a temporary fix to the code since itd be unreasonable to just ask everyone to disable this flag.p

Positive 70310 pHow do I create a dynamic image gallery to show thumbnails using angularjs and bootstrap where images will be dynamically added on load. Also it should fit in mobiles, desktops and tablets.p
Positive 70310 pWell the text color should change according to the mostcolors in a background image in a slider. For example in windows theres an option to set accent color according to the desktop wallpaper.It checks for most of the colors used in the desktop wallpaper and the color which comes the most is set as the accent color. Is there a way to implement this on websitesp

Positive 70310 pi have written code for a canvas measuring 1000 by 800 px. first i applied a lineair gradient which works properly. subsequently i wrote code to apply diagonal lines in repetitive segments with a little javascript which also works fine, because i want to changemanipulate the line width per segment i adjust the x and y coordinates accordingly per segment. unfortunately the line width changes i tried to apply do not work or render properly as i expect them to, i try to alter or manipulate the segments by applying various line width in the range 0,1,2 however most segments show the same line width.p  pfollowing is my html code the resulting page shows you an html page starting with an image which i try to draw in canvas underneath is my result or you can view the jpg on miltonchocolate.nl to see what i m trying to accomplish in canvas.p  pfurthermore there is a stylesheet connected but i have not entered anything in there yet.p  pif someone can be so kind to look at

Negative 70310 pI am implementing exception handling for our BizTalk services, and have run into a fairly major stumbling block.p  pIn order to make the exception processing as generic as possible, and therefore to allow us to use it for any BizTalk application, our XML error schema includes an xsany node, into which we can place a variety of data, depending on the actual exception.  The generated XML should then be presented to a user through an InfoPath 2003 form for manual intervention before being represented back to BizTalk.p  pThe problem is that InfoPath 2003 doesnt like schemas with an xsany node.  What wed really like to do is the show the content of the exception report in a form with all relevant parameters mapped , and the entire content of the xsany node in a text box, since users who are able to see these messages will be conversant with XML.  Unfortunately, I am unable to make InfoPath even load the schema at design time.p  pDoes anyone have any recommendation for how to achieve what we need, pleasep  pThanks in advancep

The only events that work are drag events.li liIn all modern browsers, onDragEnter and onDragOver appear to work...  but firefox lacks onDragLeave.li liFor dropping, FF uses onDragDrop while IE and others use onDrop while Safari doesnt appear to support it.li liEvents only seem to work on droppable elements, like textarea and text.

Negative 70310 pI work in a mixed source control environment.  We are still mostly on CVS, but newer projects are in SVN.  However, I am finding it hard to get buyin for SVN because TortoiseSVN doesnt work like TortoiseCVS.  p  pThe 3 way merge has a lot of cognitive dissonance and while TortoiseCVS seems to always get the merges right, TortoiseSVN almost always requires manual help.  Also after fixing any conflicts, you have to manually mark the file as ok.  p  pDoes anyone have any tips on how to get TortoiseSVN working more like TortoiseCVSp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTo be more clear, I dont want to do a three way merge, if possible, I would like to do a two way merge like TortoiseCVS does.  I know that the resulting file is the same in CVS and SVN, for example a Visual Studio project file has two different Versions.  This will always end in a conflict in TortoiseSVN and never in a conflict in TortoiseCVS.p  pSVN looks likep  precodeltltltltltltlt .mine      ltApplicationRevisiongt22ltApplicationRevisiongt       ltApplicationRevisiongt28ltApplicationRevisiongt gtgtgtgtgtgtgt .r195290 codepre  pCVS loks likep  precodeltltltltltltlt SomeFile.cproj      ltApplicationRevisiongt22ltApplicationRevisiongt       ltApplicationRevisiongt28ltApplicationRevisiongt gtgtgtgtgtgtgt 1.121 codepre  pso I should be able to get the same kind of merge.  Also, TortoiseSVN almost always has conflicts when updating if two people work on the same file, even though they are working in different locations, TortoiseCVS doesnt have this problem.  I assume TortoiseSVN is being more conservative and forcing you to check the merge TortoiseCVS is assuming CVS got it right.  I was wondering if there where some options hidden somewhere in TortoiseSVN for it to be more liberal, and also to do a two way merge instead of a three way.p  pOh, and yes we are using Subversion 1.5 which has merge points branches were basically useless without this.p

Essentially, I have a 3D point cloud, and need to find a 3D trendline.p  pMORE I apologize for the ambiguity. I tried several approaches I still havent tried modifying the linear fit and a random NN seems to work out best. I.e., I randomly pick a point from the point cloud, find the centroid of its neighbors within an arbitrary sphere, iterate. Connecting the centroids to form a smooth spline is proving to be difficult but the centroids obtained is passable.p  pTo clarify the problem, the data is not a time series and Im looking for a smooth spline which best describes the point cloud I.e., if I were to project this 3D spline on a plane formed by any 2 variables, the projected spline onto 2D will be a smooth fit of the projected point cloud onto 2D.p  pIMG Ive included an image.

Negative 70310 pI am implementing a WCF service Contract A that will eventually make calls to a standalone service Contract B hosted by the client. At designtime when the client queries my services WSDL to build its proxy, Id like to include the WSDL for Contract B so the client can build its service around that. Unfortunately, I cant figure out how to inject Contract B into the WSDL emitted by the service. Since the contract is an interface and doesnt have the [DataContract] attribute I cant add it as a known type. Is there any other way to inject a contract into emitted WSDLp  pHeres an examplep  precode[ServiceContract] public interface IServerService    [OperationContract]   void GiveTheServerMyServiceUristring uri    [OperationContract]   void TellAllClientsSomethingstring message    THIS IS THE INTERFACE I WANT TO INCLUDE IN THE WSDL [ServiceContract] public interface IClientService    [OperationContract]   void ReceiveMessageFromServerstring message   public class ServerService  IServerService    private Listltstringgt knownClients    public void GiveTheServerMyServiceUristring uri         knownClients.Adduri       public void TellAllClientsSomethingstring message        foreach string clientUri in knownClients             1. Create instance of ClientServiceProxy using clients uri        2. Call proxy.ReceiveMessageFromServermessage          codepre  pAt first it seems that this is a textbook example of a duplex contract. However, for this particular application, for a variety of reasons, I need a bit more separation between client and server so I was hoping to just give the client an interface to implement via the WSDL, let it host its own service, then just tell me the services url.p

Negative 70310 pAt my current employer we generally adopt the oldschool approach of writing a traditional functional requirements specification and then performing a full tech design. If the app is big then we break it into smaller chunks and attack it a chunk at a time but following the same basic pattern.p  pThis technique has served me well over the years. With usecase modelling it seems that you need to gather pretty much the same information, it is just organised differently.p  pSo my question is this what the tangible benefits of following a usecase driven approach to software developmentp

Negative 70310 pMy company has a basic SOA, using Entity Framework for database access. One of our services must interface with a legacy database which uses codeuniqueidentifiercode primary keys in the database. Performance is good during unit and integration testing.p  pHowever, under load, the affected service starts to produce a backlog of queued requests. This queue can be eliminated by removing the code sections which use Entity Framework to match rows by uniqueidentifier PK. The service then becomes performant again, matching rows by integer PK as part of the same routines, using the same ObjectContext.p  pThe database table performs well being queried by the legacy application which it was designed for. I therefore do not believe this problem to be related to fragmentation within the databaseindex.p  pIn the code sample shown, codedomaincode is an Entity Framework ObjectContext, codeMetaSettingcode relates to the mapped EntityObject and codematch.ObjectIdcode is a codeGuidcode.p  precodemetaSettings  domain.MetaSetting.Where     ms gt ms.AppUID.Equalsmatch.ObjectId   .ToList codepre

During the day, there are literally thousands of statements, which we cannot stop for migration.p  pEvery morning, new data is imported into the Oracle database, replacing some thousands of rows. Copying this process is not a problem, so we could, in theory, import in both databases in parallel.p  pBut, and here the challenge lies, for this to work we need to have an export from the Oracle database with a consistent state from one day.

Negative 70310 pIm writing a simple program that will run entirely clientside. Desktop programming do people still do that and I need a simple way to store trivial amounts of data in a structured form, but really dont see any need to use a database system.  Whats more, some of the data needs to be serialized and passed around to different users, like some kind of file or perhaps a document. has anyone ever done that beforep  pSo, Ive looked at using .Net DataSets, LINQ, direct XML manipulation, and they all seem like they would get the job done, but I would like to know before I dive into any of them if theres one method that is generally regarded as easier to code than others. As I said, the amount of data to be stored is trivial, even if one hundred people all used the same machine were not talking about more than 10 MB, so performance is not as large a concern as is codeabilitymaintainability.

MyControl1 contains MyControl2. MyControl2 is another UserControl which contains ProblemControl in its markup. Masterpage is nothing special and Page contains MyControl1 in its markup. The only oddity is that ProblemControl is created dynamically at codePageInitcode. p  pEverything works fine until I get to ProblemControl where none of the controls are being created. ProblemControl has the proper things all set such as the Page and Parent property. I do not see any problems. The source code for all of theseexcept ProblemControl is pretty extensive, so Im hoping someone can just give me some troubleshooting tips for this problem and if anyone has encountered it before. p  pAlso, I can place ProblemControl on another Page control and it will work fine, its something about mycontrol1 andor mycontrol2. But weve never had any problems with mycontrol1 and mycontrol2 doesnt have anything I can see wrong with it. which Ive been tediously analyzing for the past few hours.p  pHas anyone else had this same problem Are there any common things to check for p  pUpdatep  pOk, I will have a small test case in the very near future to go along with this to reproduce it.

If you want to add, get, find, or remove a person, you would do it only through the DataManager class.p  pThe problem is that I dont want anyone besides the DataManager class to be able to alter the Person objects. If someone calls DataManager.getPersonint ID for example, they would get a Person object and would be able to use the setter functions of that Person object to alter its contents first name, last name, ID, etc..p  pI want to avoid that. I want only the DataManager class to be able to alter the Person objects through methods such as DataManager.changeFirstNameForPersonint ID, string name.p  pWhat is the best class structure that can achieve thatp  pThanks, Malki.p
Negative 70310 pbrI wonder why other languages do not support this feature. What I can understand that C  C code is platform dependent so to make it work compile and execute across various platform, is achieved by using preprocessor directives. And there are many other uses of this apart from this. Like you can put all your debug printfs inside codeif DEBUG ... endifcode. So while making the release build these lines of code do not get compiled in the binary.br But in other languages, achieving this thing later part is difficult or may be impossible, Im not sure. All code will get compiled in the binary increasing its size. So my question is why do codeJava, or other modern compiled languagescode no support this kind of feature which allows you to include or exclude some piece of code from the binary in a much handy way.p

Negative 70310 pI have a program to process very large files. Now I need to show a progress bar to show the progress of the processing. The program works on a word level, read one line at a time, splitting it into words and processing the words one by one. So while the programs runs, it knows the count of the words processed. If somehow it knows the word count of the file beforehand, it can easily calculate the progress.p  pThe problem is that, the files I am dealing with may be very large and hence its not a good idea to process the file twice, once to get the total word count and next to run actual processing code.p  pSo I am trying to write a code which can estimate the word count of a file by reading a small portion of it. This is what I have come up with in Clojurep  precodedefn estimatedwordcount [file]   let [java.io.File file asfile file         java.io.Reader rdr reader file         buffer chararray 1000         charsread .read rdr buffer 0 1000]     .close rdr     if  charsread 1       0        0.001 .length file          gt String. buffer 0 charsread tokenizeline count codepre  pThis code reads the first 1000 characters from the file, creates a String from it, tokenizes it to get words, counts the words and then estimates the word count of the file by multiplying it with the length of the file and dividing it by 1000.p  pWhen I run this code on a file with English text, I get almost correct word count. But, when I run this on a file with Hindi text encoded in UTF8, it return almost double of the real word count.p  pI understand that this issue is because of the encoding. So is there any way to solve itp  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  pAs a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3516779estimatingthewordcountofafilewithoutreadingthefullfile35169143516914suggested by Franka, I determine the byte count of the first 10000 characters and  use it to estimate the word count of the file.p  precodedefn charsperbyte [String s]    count s Integer count .getBytes s UTF8  defn estimatefilewordcount [file]   let [file asfile file         rdr reader file         buffer chararray 10000         charsread .read rdr buffer 0 10000]     .close rdr     if  charsread 1       0       let [s String. buffer 0 charsread]           1.0 charsread .length file charsperbyte s           gt s tokenizeline count codepre  pNote that this assume UTF8 encoding.

Negative 70310 pTired of handcrafting mocks, I am trying to introduce Mockito to my project.p  pSuppose I have a bunch of database accessors which isolate all Hibernate queries for given use case or service. So I can have such interfaces as codeRoutingDaocode, codeUserDaocode, codeReportingDaocode. Each of these interfaces extends a very generic codeDaocode with methods such as codecommitcode, coderollbackcode or codereloadEntitycode. With Hibernate the latter is supposed to reload a detached entity with the current session. In tests, it should just return its argument.p  pWith handcrafted mocks it was easy I had a codeMockDaocode with common implementation of this method, and codeMockRoutingDaocode would extend codeMockDaocode and use that implementation. One way I see with Mockito is to create codeMockRoutingDaocode that extends codeMockDaocode and delegates unmocked calls to it. The notinherited methods would be mocked with a codespycode. But this is pretty ugly  I still need to handcraft a mock, and the whole idea of partial mocking amp inheritance for reusing some implementation is a mess.p  pHow can I improve it strongWhat are the best practices to create shared implementation for a mock method that can be reused accross many testsstrongp

Negative 70310 pIm looking for a portable method for creating threads specifically for output of data in C. Id prefer to stay away from Boost if possible, but Im not against using it if its the best option.p  pHere is the situation I have a program that does a complex computation on some data that it reads and produces three output streams with a large amount of textual data. These three streams are being compressed on the fly using the Bzip2 library. What I would like to do is to have the main computation run in the main thread, while the compression and output of the data is done in three additional threads. The idea being that in this way I can utilise the available computing cores and eliminate any bottleneck that the Bzip2 compression may be causing to the actual processing.p  pThe way I imagine this working is for the three output threads to have open output file streams and to be waiting for string data that will then be compressed and output. The main thread will run its computation sending output to the other threads when necessary. Obviously, adequate buffering will have to be designed, but thats not a problem.p  pId appreciate any suggestions regarding the best way to tackle this problem, in particular, what C libraries are the most appropriate for the task at hand. Keep in mind, that I would like to handle the buffering in the output threads and they should receive string class data.p  pThanks in advancep

I can clear it, but it doesnt seem to refresh with the original data. p  pIve tried unsuccessfully to call the webservice again and set the dataprovider to the new lastResult token.

Strings of consecutive letters and digits representing words  2. Onecharacter strings representing punctuation or separators   To use this class, you must first create an instance of a  Scanner object by declaring   Scanner scanner   You initialize the scanners input stream by calling   scanner.setInputstr   where str is the string from which tokens should be read.  Once you have done so, you can then retrieve the next token  by making the following call   token  scanner.nextToken   To determine whether any tokens remain to be read, you can call  the predicate method scanner.hasMoreTokens. The nextToken  method returns the empty string after the last token is read.   The following code fragment serves as an idiom for processing  each token in the string inputString   Scanner scanner  scanner.setInputinputString  while scanner.hasMoreTokens   string token  scanner.nextToken  . . . process the token . . .     This version of the Scanner class includes an option for skipping  whitespace characters, which is described in the comments for the  setSpaceOption method.  ifndef scannerh define scannerh include genlib.h   Class Scanner    This class is used to represent a single instance of a scanner.  class Scanner  public   Constructor Scanner  Usage Scanner scanner    The constructor initializes a new scanner object. The scanner  starts empty, with no input to scan.      Scanner   Destructor Scanner  Usage usually implicit    The destructor deallocates any memory associated with this scanner.      Scanner   Method setInput  Usage scanner.setInputstr    This method configures this scanner to start extracting  tokens from the input string str. Any previous input string is  discarded.      void setInputstring str   Method nextToken  Usage token  scanner.nextToken    This method returns the next token from this scanner. If  nextToken is called when no tokens are available, it returns the  empty string.      string nextToken   Method hasMoreTokens  Usage if scanner.hasMoreTokens . . .    This method returns true as long as there are additional  tokens for this scanner to read.      bool hasMoreTokens   Methods setSpaceOption, getSpaceOption  Usage scanner.setSpaceOptionoption  option  scanner.getSpaceOption    This method controls whether this scanner  ignores whitespace characters or treats them as valid tokens.  By default, the nextToken function treats whitespace characters,  such as spaces and tabs, just like any other punctuation mark.  If, however, you call   scanner.setSpaceOptionScannerIgnoreSpaces   the scanner will skip over any white space before reading a  token. You can restore the original behavior by calling   scanner.setSpaceOptionScannerPreserveSpaces   The getSpaceOption function returns the current setting  of this option.      enum spaceOptionT  PreserveSpaces, IgnoreSpaces      void setSpaceOptionspaceOptionT option     spaceOptionT getSpaceOption     Methods setStringOption, getStringOption   Usage scanner.setStringOptionoption          option  scanner.getStringOption      This method controls how the scanner reads double quotation marks    as input.  The default is set to treat quotes just like any other    punctuation character       scanner.setStringOptionScannerScanQuotesAsPunctuation      Otherwise, the option      scanner.setStringOptionScannerScanQuotesAsStrings     the token starting with a quotation mark will be scanned until   another quotation mark is found closing quotation. Therefore   the entire string within the quotation, including both quotation   marks counts as 1 token.       enum stringOptionT  ScanQuotesAsPunctuation, ScanQuotesAsStrings       void setStringOptionstringOptionT option     stringOptionT getStringOption   private  include scanpriv.h  endif codepre  p and finally scanpriv.h p  precode  File scanpriv.h    This file contains the private data for the simplified version  of the Scanner class.

Negative 70310 pIm trying to port Apples GLPaint example to use GLKit. Using a UIView, its possible to return the CAEAGLLayer of the view and set the drawableProperties to include kEAGLDrawablePropertyRetainedBacking. This has the effect of retaining the drawable contents after presenting the render buffer, as expected. Removing this property results in flickering after the draw call with part of the drawable content seemingly being drawn to different buffers.p  pThe problem is this is exactly the issue I am now having in my GLKView, but there doesnt seem to be a way to set the drawable properties. Returning a CAEAGLLayer and setting the properties has no effect and I dont see any relevant properties of GLKView to set retained backing.p  pHas anybody else come across this or have a solutionp

Negative 70310 pI have a project where I need to build and store large trees of data in Ruby. I am considering different approaches for serialization, deserialization and querying of trees, and I am wondering what would be the best way to go. My major constraints are read time, query efficiency and and crossversioncrossplatform compatibility. The most frequent operation is to retrieve sets of nodes based on a combination of idvalue andor features.Trees can be up to 1520 levels deep. Moving subtrees is an uncommon procedure, but should be possible without too much black magic. Rails integration is not a primary concern. The options I thought about, along with some issues Im concerned about, are the followingp  ul liMarshal the trees, and when needed load them into memory and query them in Ruby inefficiency as tree grows, crossversion compatibilityli liSame as above, but use YAML more crossversion compatible, but less efficientli liSame as above, but use a custom XML parser need to recreate objects from scratch each time the tree is loadedli liSerialize the trees to XML, store them in an XML database e.g. Sedna and use XPath to query the trees no experience with this approach, not sure about efficiencyli liUse  adjacency lists to query trees stored in an schemaless database inefficiency when counting descendantsli liUse materialized paths potential of overfilling the max string length for deep trees li liUse nested sets complex SQL queriesli liUse the a hrefhttpwww.mongodb.orgdisplayDOCSTreesinMongoDBTreesinMongoDBArrayofAncestors relnofollowarray of ancestorsa approach Seems interesting in terms of querying efficiency according to the MongoDB page, but I havent been able to find any serious discussion of this algorithm. li ul  pBased on your experience, which approach would better fit with the constraints I have described If I go for an XML database, are there ones that would be more suited for this project Are there other approaches I have overlooked that would be more efficient Thanks for your time.p

Negative 70310 pIve got an Android app that is using a list activity to display a list of items pulled from the internet. I First use an AsyncTask to load the list and that Async task finishes it calls a different async task to start loading the thumbnail pictures that go along with the list items. The problem I am having is that the user has access to a refresh button that they can press at any time and when it is pressed, the whole list of items is delete and the loading starts over. The Async task that loads the thumbnails could potentially still be running if this happens and may try to add a thumbnail to a non existing list item then. Ive tried synchronizing on the list, using a Boolean which after researching I realized would not work. I have also tried using a static atomic boolean to check if refresh has been hit to cancel the thumbnail loader.

Negative 70310 pI am having some trouble uploading code to my a hrefhttpwww.seeedstudio.comwikiindex.phptitleSeeeduinoADKMainBoard relnofollowSeeeduino ADKa essentially a Arduino Mega 2560 using Eclipse.  Basically, a hrefhttpwww.arduino.cccgibinyabb2YaBB.plnum1290630370 relnofollowthis threada explains my problem.  Sometimes I get a series of timeouts using the Arduino IDE upload, which is usually fixed by removing and reinserting the USB.  Unfortunately enough, this does not help fix the problem in Eclipse.  p  pI have been trying to do the upload using AVRdude via the command line I even tried the hacky solution in the last comment of the above thread, but to no avail.  This is the line I am using for thisp  precodeAVRDUDE pm2560 cstk500v2 P.COMMPORT b115200 F V D  UflashwHEXFILEa CAVRDUDECONF codepre  pWhich gives mep  precodeavrdude.exe stk500v2ReceiveMessage timeout codepre  pI know the above batch variables are OK, because AVRdude runs correctly but then it times out.  If anyone has any ideas or tips that could help me with my uploading I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks beforehand.p  pEDIT As it turns out, the reason for this may be that the Arduino IDE sends a reset to the board before uploading, something which the Eclipse AVR plugin does not do.  I will test this and write a uploading perl script, but I am fairly certain this is the problem.p

That said, Im wanting to have a full screen mode. Click a button and the images will fill the screen. p  pTo do the fullscreen, Im adding a class to the outer most wrapper. That class is defined as position fixed, left0, top0. Note I dont think this detail matters but what the heck. The leap to full screen work. Its basically the same uls just wrapped up and CSSed slightly different.p  pHowever, the line of code above stops working. Im not getting an error. Specifically, the fadeOut simply stops working. The fadeIn works but for some reason the fadeOut doesnt. In short, the slides stop sliding, then just pile up. I can go forward in the index, 2, 3, 4, etc. But when I try to go back the currentIndex never does the fadeOut. p  pFinally, I tried to force it with a hide but then theres a flash of sorts. I also dont want the instant effect of hide. Even if its a super fast fade, thats still more pleasing. p  pAnyone have any clues Obviously, I do not. Thanks.     p  pPerhaps this will help jsfiddle.netchiefalchemistUvpGN5 Please see comment below about this working. That is, it doesnt reproduce the broke fadeOut. p  pLet me break it down to its most basic level...The fadeOut and fadeIn are operating on on the same selector  object in the same line of code. Its a matter of two different indexs being changed. Why does fadeout not work but fadeIn does Thats why Im stumped. p

Negative 70310 pIs there any way to select an OS window in Java under Xorgp  pEssentially Id like to replicate the functionality of a command like xwininfo, but Id like to avoid executing it as a child process if possible. As for the actual information needed, Im looking for the position and size x, y, width, height of a window selected by the user, preferably as with xwininfo via the mouse, but searching by name would be acceptable as well.p  pAs far as I know this functionality doesnt exist in the standard JDK, but a premade library or some reasonably straightforward JNA code would be perfect. Compatibility is only needed with recent versions of Linux  Xorg.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 70310 pI have been looking into the use of Qt for C developing applications on Linux and have read through most of the book C GUI programming with Qt4. This is great for applications that need a front end, but now I have a requirement to write a C command line only application but using some of the Qt networking and socket classes. It has to be command line only as it will run on a host machine that runs command line only install of Ubuntu. In my book I can find absolutely no reference at all to going down this route  everything is described with GUI in mind. p  pBasically all I need is a yesno answer although a pointer to how to start would also be very welcome as to whether I can use Qt to create a command line only application Many thanks.p

Negative 70310 pI have a UIViewController with 2 main subviews. One subview is UIViewController and the other is a DialogViewController. The DialogViewController contains a few elements. I have a custom background that I would like to assign behind the DVC so when the user scrolls up or down, the background is shown until they release their finger or mouse and the view bounces back into its original position.p  pThe problem is, when I assign the background using the method I have found through searching, the elements appear clear and show the background through them when the view loads. However, when I scroll enough to push the element off of the screen before bouncing back, the elements background then goes back to white. I want my elements to always be white and have only the background as my custom image.p  pThe code I have used to try to achieve this is as followsp  precode Declare my background UIImage background  UIImage.FromBundleimagesbackground.png   Assign background pattern to dvcs ParentViewController  which is my NavigationController Not sure if this is what it should be  dvc.TableView.BackgroundColor  UIColor.Clear dvc.ParentViewController.View.BackgroundColor  UIColor.FromPatternImagebackground codepre  pI have also tried assigning to the dvc.TableView.BackgroundView with no luck.p  pAny tips would be much appreciated. p

Negative 70310 pThe internet is absolutely littered with incorrect and nonideal answers to this question. This is unfortunate because you would think this would be a common thing you would want to do.p  pThe problem When a codeprecommitcode hook runs, the repository might not be clean. So if you naively run your tests, they will not be against what youre committing, but whatever dirt happens to be in your working tree.p  pThe obvious thing to do is to codegit stash keepindex includeuntrackedcode at the start of the codeprecommitcode and codegit popcode at the exit. That way you are testing against the pure index, which is what we want.p  pUnfortunately, this generates merge conflict markers if you use codegit add patchcode, especially if you edit hunks, since the contents of codestash0code might not match up against the work tree after commit.p  pAnother common solution is to clone the repository and run the tests in a new temporary one. There are two issues with that One is that we havent committed yet, so we cant easily get a copy of the repository in the state were about to commit Im sure there is a way of doing that, but Im not interested because. Secondly, my tests might be sensitive to the location of the current working directory. For example because of local environment configuration.p  pSo How can I restore my worktree to whatever state it was in before the codegit stash keepindex includeuntrackedcode, without introducing merge conflict markers, and without modifying the postcommit codeHEADcodep

Negative 70310 pstrongThis unexplainable probably affects or will affect thousands of webmasters.strong p  pThe problem is Paypal doesnt give a response to this request AT ALL. Below is the sample code I use and also my programmers commentsp  pPayPal doesnt give any response to this request at all, an empty string comes from it. You may ask the PayPal team, if anything besides Host and HTTP1.1 should be added to handle response properly. Could it be that the cmd command should have another value My expectation is that PayPal will open HTTP1.1 protocols only in February 2013, as they state in their email. Im not sure how the same script and host may handle different protocols. The script is not working now with HTTP1.1 with the code we have on file, and the reason may be on PayPals side. I was following how PayPal queries the IPN script, and it seems that it goes into some kind of loop, when theres HTTP 1.1 set. You can still see it yourself in ipnlogz.txt  073A393A41  i.e. 073941 date of my order  its repeated 5 times Why Who knows...  it only means PayPal was trying to IPN this script 5 times and with no success. There appeared VERIFIED response from PayPal only when Ive updated HTTP to 1.0 and reuploaded the script. After that, PayPal was still querying it. It seems when HTTP  1.1 , PayPal is getting everything properly, but not responding properly then for some reason gets back to create yet another response for the same payment. With HTTP 1.0 its all like a flower one request, one response, everything works. I dont know whats wrong with it...p  pPs. We are not talking about an INVALID response. An INVALID response is actually part of success but in the case of HTTP 1.1, PayPal doesnt provide any response at all, it is an empty string.p  precodeltphp  req  cmdnotifyvalidate r  foreach POST as key gt value  value  urlencodestripslashesvalue req . ampkeyvalue r.key valuen    post back to PayPal system to validate header .

Negative 70310 pId like to apologize in advance if the question is a little vague but its hard for me to provide a specific part of the code that could be responsible for what is going on.p  pI extended a BaseExpandableListAdapter to use in one of my Activities StreamActivity to populate an ExpandableListView. This Activity is part of an ActivityGroup. Then, it turned out I needed a very similar adapter for a different Activity StreamUserActivity that is not part of a group. I decided to extend my custom adapter further and only override certain methods that are different. The logic behind the row structure is the same for both adapters.p  pHowever, when I use the second adapter, the one for the standalone Activity, when I call notifyDataSetChanged, before the list gets updated the screen goes black. On some occassions it is just a temporary blink, sometimes it stays that way. Then, if I scroll the list, it appears again but an element above the ExpandableListView does not reappear. Still, I can touch the active elements in this element and it reacts be transferring me to another Activity, as planned.p  pThe StreamUserActivity is started from within the StreamActivity the following wayp  precodeIntent streamUserProfiletIntent  new Intentthis, StreamUserProfileActivity.class streamUserProfiletIntent.putExtraStreamUserProfileActivity.USERJID, OpenfireRosterProvider.getInstancegetApplicationContext.getCurrentUser.getJabberId startActivitystreamUserProfiletIntent codepre  pThis causes the screen to go black.

Selecting from the table where codeiscovercode  1 is pretty fast and straightforward, but when put in a larger query everything breaks up.p  precodeSELECT subbnb.,              3956  2  ASIN                 SQRT                     POWER                         SINLAT  abslat  pi180  2,                      2                      COSLAT  pi180                        COSabslat  pi180                       POWER                         SINLNG  abslng  pi180  2,                      2                                AS distance,             prices.price,             pics.imgpaththumbgrid,             reviews.count reviewsCount,             likes.count likesCount         FROM              SELECT                 bnb.,                 bnbdataa.,                 pos.lat,                 pos.lng                  FROM bnb                  JOIN bnbdata                      ON bnb.id  bnbdata.bnbid                  JOIN positions pos                     ON bnb.id  pos.bnbid               subbnb              LEFT JOIN                      SELECT                      FROM pics                      WHERE iscover  1                  pics                 ON subbnb.id  pics.bnbid               LEFT JOIN SELECT price, bnbid FROM prices WHERE category  DAILY prices                 ON subbnb.id  prices.bnbid              LEFT JOIN SELECT COUNT AS count, bnbid FROM reviews GROUP BY bnbid reviews                 ON subbnb.id  reviews.bnbid              LEFT JOIN SELECT COUNT AS count, bnbid FROM likes GROUP BY bnbid likes                 ON subbnb.id  likes.bnbid         WHERE             lng BETWEEN LNGA AND  LNGB             AND lat BETWEEN LATA AND  LATB         HAVING distance lt 10         ORDER BY distance         LIMIT 0, 25 codepre  pthe strings you see with  prepended are actual numerical valuesp  pcodeEXPLAINcodeing the query produces the following resultp  precodeid  selecttype table   type    possiblekeys   key keylen ref rows    Extra 1   PRIMARY ltderived5gt  system  NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    0   const row not found 1   PRIMARY ltderived6gt  system  NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    0   const row not found 1   PRIMARY ltderived2gt  ALL NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    10522   Using where Using temporary Using filesort 1   PRIMARY ltderived3gt  ALL NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    7040     1   PRIMARY ltderived4gt  ALL NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    1    6   DERIVED likes   index   NULL    PRIMARY 6   NULL    1   Using index 5   DERIVED reviews index   NULL    bnbid  5   NULL    1   Using index 4   DERIVED prices  ALL NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    1   Using where 3   DERIVED pics    ref iscover    iscover    2       11760   Using where 2   DERIVED pos ALL PRIMARY NULL    NULL    NULL    10543    2   DERIVED bnbdata eqref  PRIMARY PRIMARY 3   db.pos.bnbid   1    2   DERIVED bnb eqref  PRIMARY PRIMARY 3   db.pos.bnbid   1    codepre  pIt looks like the codeiscovercode index is being ignored by MySQL codeUsing wherecode, id 4 but the same happens when I run the small select against the codepicscode table and everything happens very quickly.

Negative 70310 pI have a question regarding the behavior of a jdbc message store.  I notice that if a failure occurs for instance if the following sequence is followed 1inboundchanneladapter  Creates a message payload and sends it to a channel 2The channel is polled for the payload by a jmsoutboundchanneladapter which adds an entry in the JMS queue.  I am using ActiveMQ.p  pWhen I test for a situation like shutting down the MOM I would like to persist the message in the messagestore, but this is not the default behavior.  Looks like SI processes the payload in the channel and then pushes it out deletes it from the store.  I can see the message being inserted in the messagestore in the database.p  pAm I wrong in understanding the function of a messagestore  I thought that the message would persist until a successful run. Thanks for any feedback. p

Negative 70310 pThis is somewhat of an updated question from a problem I had earlier.  I am creating a match.com style app for local dog adoptions, where users and dogs have a profile. In each profile, there are Boolean fields.  I am trying to show the end user only the dogs that match their user profile.  A simple onetoone match does not work however since the logic changes depending on the users Boolean.  For example, if a user has kids user.kidsunder10 true then I simply match it to a dog that can be placed with kids dog.kidsunder10true. The model would look likep  precodeclass Dog lt ActiveRecordBase  def self.byprofileuser   if user.kidsunder10  true     Dog.wherekidsunder10 user.kidsunder10   end end codepre  pIf the user does not have kids however, dogs that answer both true and false to this question can be displayed, since dogs that are AND are not kid friendly can be placed with this user.  I realize that if this were the only criteria for matching, I could simply add a codeelse, Dog.allcode statement to the above method.  Since there will other Boolean fields to match however i.e. user.hascats and dog.catfriendly, this solution would not work.  I think I need a variable containing an array here, but not really sure... any suggestions.p

Why is this happening  In which case will the OS load test.scale140.jpg or test.scale180.jpg image p  pstrongEDITstrong I got it working. Once your app starts in simulator, close it by pressing home buton amp uninstall it. In VS, right click on Project and click on Deploy. App should be now deployed to simulator. Change the resolution and start the app. You should now see correct image loaded by OS. Rinse and repeat to test other resolutions.  p
Negative 70310 pI have a library with a bunch of different objects that have similar expected behavior, thus I want to run similar tests on them, but not necessarily identical tests on them.p  pTo be specific lets say I have some sorting functions, and a test for checking if a sorting function actually sorts. Some sorting functions are intended to work on some inputs, but not others.p  pId like to write something close to the code below. However, nose wont do a good job of telling me exactly where the tests failed and with what inputs. If checksort fails for sort2 on case2, I wont be able to see that. p  precodedef checksortsortalg, vals      assert sortalgvals  sortvals   def testsorts      case1  [1,3,2]     case2  [2,31,1]      checksortsort1, case1      for c in [case1, case2]          checksortsort2, c codepre  pI would like to be able to simply add a decorator to checksort to tell nose that its a nested test. Something likep  precodenestedtest def checksortsortalg, vals      assert sortalgvals  sortvals codepre  pThe idea being that when it gets called, it registers itself with nose and will report its inputs if it fails.p  pIt looks like pytest provides a hrefhttppytest.orglatestparametrize.htmlparametrizedtestfunctions relnofollowpytest.mark.parameterizeda, but that seems rather awkward to me. I have to put all my arguments above the function in one spot, so I cant call it repeatedly in my tests.

Negative 70310 pLets take, for example, this arrayp  precodear  [6,3,5,1,2] codepre  pI want to convert it to another array and I might use only two operations  insert item at specific position splicei,0,item or remove item from specific position splicei,1. Im looking for the solution that uses minimal quantity of theese splices. p  pThe second important condition is that we consider arrays with unique values, our arrays dont contain doubles. p  pFor example, p  precodear1  [6,3,10,5,1,2] ar2  [6,3,1,2,5] codepre  pThats obvious that if we want to get ar1 from ar, we need only one splice  ar.splice2,0,10. If we want to get ar2, we have to do two splices ar.splice2,1 and then push5 the second equals to splicear.length,0,5p  pBy the way, this task has natural practical value. Lets imagine, for example, list of products and product filter. We change filters settings and the list changes respectively. And every change followed by beauty slow jquery slide up  slide down animation. This animation might slide up and hide specific item or insert and slide down a new one. The task is to minify the quantity of theese animations. That means we try to minify the quantity of DOMmanipulations of the list.p

Negative 70310 pIts a common problem that jQuery widgets inside ASP UpdatePanels need to reinitialized after an ajax request, however my issue is that events are not unbound prior to replacing the HTML inside the UpdatePanel. jQuery takes care of this problem for you whenever you call .html... or .remove, but the UpdatePanel doesnt utilize jQuery.p  pI have popup elements inside of the UpdatePanel, which need to be hidden when the user clicks outside of them so I made a jQuery Special Event for detecting when this happens however the Teardown function is never called after the Ajax request. So over time there are more and more event handlers on elements which are no longer attached to the document.p  pI could have my widget initialization function which gets ran after every Ajax request, check for detached elements and unbind their events but Im afraid that could cause other issues down the road.p

Negative 70310 pi need to verify a lot of images files for an application, the situations is that i have 10 directories with almost 10,000 images on each one, something like 100,000 files. Those files are supposed to be gif files but a lot of them and really mean a lot were jpg files that a designer change the extension from .jpg to .gif without converting the file format. This is causing the application crash, it creates pdf files using those images, and if i tell to the programm that use the file somefile.gif but it really is a jpg with the extension renamed the pdf creator crashes. I dont want to open every file in something like irfanview or photoshop to verify the format and then modify it if is necessary. Is there a library, class, plugin or something in php or another language that tell me the format of files with no base in the extension but in the headers of the filep  pI cant find any ideas to do this, some one can help mep  pThanxs a lot in advancep
Negative 70310 pI have am trying to dig into twitter bootstrap and rails3 sites that actually look and function well new to it all.  I have this feature I want where I have a twitter bootstrap navigation specified in what I guess is the default application layout that calls a navigation.erb.html etc.  This works great, but on that navigation i want a Se Habla Espanol or what not, where when the user clicks there, the navigation text all changes to spanish.  i thought easiest would be have another navigationespanol.erb.html or something that changes the navigation words all around and also when click toggling into spanish mode it sets all the text in the pages to spanish by anytime there is a text render or whatever a variable flag was set and is interrogated on page index render show or what have you and it renders spanish or english words...p  pSo ideally click on see it all in spanish, it loads a new layout my main question that has the spanish navigation and messages and other twitter bootstrap stuff and it also sets a global var i can look at in other renders to see if im rendering english or spanish.p

Negative 70310 pI am wondering if there is a way to ignore certain TypeScript errors upon compilationp  pI basically have the same issues most people with large projects have around using the emthisem keyword, and I dont want to put all my classes methods into the constructor.p  pSo I have got an example like sop  pa hrefhttpwww.typescriptlang.orgPlaygroundsrcclass20LambdaMethods0A7B0A09private20message3a20string0A090A09constructor28message3a20string290A097B0A0909this.message2020message0A097D0A090A09public20DoSomething20202829203E207B20alert28this.message29207D0A7D0A0Avar20instance2020new20LambdaMethods2822Test22290Ainstance.DoSomething2829 relnofollowTypeScript Exampleap  pWhich seems to create perfectly valid JS and allows me to get around the emthisem keyword issue, however as you can see in the example the typescript compiler tells me that I cannot compile that code as the keyword this is not valid within that scope. However I dont see why it is an error as it produces okay code.p  pSo is there a way to tell it to ignore certain errors I am sure given time there will be a nice way to manage the strongthisstrong keyword, but currently I find it pretty dire.p  p Edit  p  pstrongDo not read unless you care about context of this question and partial rantstrongp  pJust to add some context to all this to show that Im not just some nutjob I am sure a lot of you will still think I am and that I have some good reasons why I want to be able to allow these errors to go through.p  pHere are some previous questions I have made which highlight some major problems imo with TypeScript emcurrentem strongthisstrong implementation.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15679838usinglawnchairwithtypescriptUsing lawnchair with Typescriptap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15925500issuewithchildscopingofthisintypescriptIssue with child scoping of this in Typescriptap  pa hrefhttpstypescript.codeplex.comdiscussions429350 relnofollowhttpstypescript.codeplex.comdiscussions429350a And some comments I make down the bottomp  pThe underlying problem I have is that I need to guarantee that all logic is within a consistent scope, I need to be able to access things within knockout, jQuery etc and the local instance of a class. I used to do this with the codevar self  thiscode within the class declaration in JavaScript and worked great. As mentioned in some of these previous questions I cannot do that now, so the only way I can guarantee the scope is to use lambda methods, and the only way I can define one of these as a method within a class is within the constructor, and this part is HEAVILY down to personal preference, but I find it horrific that people seem to think that using that syntax is classed as a recommended pattern and not just a work around.p  pI know TypeScript is in alpha phase and a lot will change, and I HOPE so much that we get some nicer way to deal with strongthisstrong but currently I either make everything a huge mess just to get typescript working and this is within Hundreds of files which Im migrating over to TypeScript  or I just make the call that I know better than the compiler in this case VERY DANGEROUS I KNOW so I can keep my code nice and hopefully when a better pattern comes out for handling this I can migrate it then.p  pAlso just on a side note I know a lot of people are loving the fact that TypeScript is embracing and trying to stay as close to the new JavaScript features and known syntax as possible which is great, but typescript is NOT the next version of JavaScript so I dont see a problem with adding some syntactic sugar to the language as people who want to use the latest and greatest official JavaScript implementation can still do so.p

Negative 70310 pI have created a switch in my website. It works like a light switch. When people click on it, the background color and the color of some text paragraph will switch to different colors.

Negative 70310 pI am a neophyte at C threading. I am trying to get my head around how to make 100K web requests, emwith some degree of parallelismem, and report progress realtime to the GUIp  precodeurls processed so far  total moved so far     timed out so far      3 codepre  pI am reading pages 596ff in emC 5.0 in a Nutshellem by the Albahari brothers, the section on Progress Reporting.  At this point, I dont see how in the Progress instance these counters would be incremented in a threadsafe manner, and exactly howwhere the UI gets updated. EVen in the example specifically discussing the differences between writing to the console and writing to the GUI, the book uses codeConsole.WriteLinecode. Id be grateful for an example showing exactly what occurs in the Progress instance  incrementing some int variables and writing to a textbox, for example.p

Negative 70310 pI am trying to use SSL with Tomcat and an APR connector.

However, the exact same Java code can connect to the same server on a different port hosted by Apache with SSL. In addition, nonJava code like curl can connect to the Tomcat SSL connection.p  pI have gotten this to work by forcing the Java client to use the TLSv1 protocol Dhttps.protocolsTLSv1.

I want to use these two custom K2 templates that existed in the previous version for both user registration and user profile because they were using K2 as the user registration mechanism.p  pIve configured K2 to codeEnable K2 User Profilecodep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com31cW7.png altEnable K2 User Profilep  pbut for whatever reason, when I navigate to codeindex.phpoptioncomusersampviewregistercode its still grabbing the default registration form. Now, I thought it was maybe the URL, but the old 1.7 system is using the same URL. So, with some debugging I found that when the layout is told to search for a file, the K2 path isnt in the array.p  pWhat did I do wrong herep  pstrongNOTEstrong I also tried configuring the codeUser Managercode so that codeAllow User Registrationcode was set to codeNocode, but I just get a code403code then because its just not overriding with that K2 template.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6Lgyw.png altAllow User Registrationp  h1UPDATEh1  pAs I stated in the comments, for whatever reason I dont have a K2 registration menu item type. However, the weirdest part is that the 1.7 version didnt point to the K2 registration either.p  pA little more background. This is a really hacked together system. The menu is actually built with a Jumi module that is straight forward custom and when the user is logged in the link that is used for the profile for example is thisp  precodeindex.phpoptioncomusersampviewuseramplayoutformampid3 codepre  pand the register link, which is also custom i.e. its a link on a custom view is thisp  precodeindex.phpoptioncomuserampviewregister codepre  pSo, in short, I dont know enough about the Joomla navigation system to understand how to get those links to reroute to the K2 views that reside codecomponentscomk2templatescode folder.p  h1UPDATEh1  pI put the coderegister.phpcode view that existed in codecomponentscomk2templatescode folder into the codetemplatestmplnamehtmlcomusersregistercode folder and renamed it codedefault.phpcode so that the default user registration navigation would choose that view. And it did choose that view, no real surprise, but it also failed on a line like thisp  precodeltphp ifcountarrayfilterthisgtK2Plugins gt codepre  pbecause codeK2Pluginscode is codenullcode and thats not allowed for the codearrayfiltercode function. Im guessing this is because if this view were inside the codecomk2code folder, like its original location, this would be available. Im trying everything I can think of now.p  pIt also threw on this linep  precodethisgtK2ParamsgtgetrecaptchaOnRegistration codepre  pbecause codeK2Paramscode is null so of course codegetcode isnt available.p

I can only assume its something to do with the autoinserted space between words, because if I manually enter a space for which it does trigger and then swipe a word it doesnt trigger.p  pWeirdly though, I think this must be a problem with Phonegap or embedded web views because if I visit this a hrefhttpcodepen.iojackocnrpenEKqrc relnofollowcodepena on my phone in the default browser Chrome, it DOES trigger for the first word.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I just discovered the input event, which is a workaroundp  precodetext.oninput, function ... codepre  pBut I just checked another Phonegap app a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.healthtap.userhtexpress relnofollowHealthTapa on Google Play, and found that it suffers from the same issue the Medical or Grad School input on the Doctor signup page, so I guess this is a Phonegap bugp

Below already answered By Anton, Thanksp  pIt sounds like tcp uses its own packet numbering to ensure the packets end up in the right order on the other side.

Negative 70310 pstrongIn shortstrong I cant find the correct CSS files which would let me play around with the designs on my localhost. The changes are not applying right away. Assets are all precompiled, and Im confused.p  pstrongSummarystrong Im trying to understand how Im supposed to organize my local assets. There is the local machine, staging server, and production server. Capistrano precompiles assets when I deploy them to the staging server or the production server. When other people work on the code and deploy on staging, then I have to pull those changes, right This makes me pull the compiled assets. So, I end up with the CSS files, which are minimized and I cant really change things on those CSS files and see change on my localhost. p  pHow can I keep the local files not compiled, even if I need to pull versions from servers that have already compiled assets on them. I would really appreciate it, if anyone can give me good direction for keeping the best rails development environment. I just want to keep the assets strongnot compiledstrong on the local environment.p  pCheersp

Negative 70310 pShort version Whats the proper way to store a list of several hundred numbers in Clojure, where each number is being incremented millions of times potentially across several threadsp  pLong version The program starts with an empty vector where each value is initialized to 0p  precode[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...] codepre  pIt then reads a multimillion line file, linebyline. After performing some arbitrary computation on a line, the program increments some of the values in the vector. After the first line the vector may look likep  precode[1 1 1 2 0 1 0 1 1 ...] codepre  pAfter the second linep  precode[2 2 3 2 2 1 0 2 2 ...] codepre  pAfter 5000 lines it may look something likep  precode[5000 4998 5008 5002 4225 5098 5002 5043 ...] codepre  pSince Clojures data structures are immutable simply using codeassoccode to increment a value in the vector seems incredibly wasteful, because the entirety of the vector will be copied for each increment.p  pWhat is the correct way to do this kind of concurrent data aggregation without spending all my CPU time copying immutable data structures Should I have a vector where each element is something like a ref or atom, with all threads incrementing those shared values Or, is there some kind of threadlevel data structure that can store the counts, and then the final step is to consolidate the counts from each threadp  pThis probably wont be IO bound on a single thread so Im guessing I will split line processing across several threads. There is no limit to the length of the vector it could be several thousand elements long but more than likely it be around 100 elements long.p

This is not easy to me. p  pSo the idea would be to modify thisp  precodeproc means datahave class ind1 ind2 ind3 var dependent5 dependent6 output outwant sum run codepre  pSuch that it additionally could count the number of distinct values of variable 4, for each combination of variables 1,2, and 3, including ALL. p  pIdeas Ive hadp  p1 Abandon hope all ye who entered here go back to trying to do this in proc sql with a bunch of macro code, which allows you to use the countdistinct  useful thang.p  p2 Something with nlevels p  p3 Using convoluted, terrible macro code to generate however many hashes would be necessary to handle the uniques.p  p4 p  pCreating sample data here is kind of tricky let me know if this makes no sense and Ill do my best to come up with some.p  pp  pEdit to be clear, the reason SQL queries require macro code and would be slow is because it would need to be something like the following but expanded to many more levelsp  precodeselect ALL as ind1, ind2 ... group by ind1, ind2  select ind1, ALL as ind2 ... group by ind1, ind2  select ALL as ind1, ALL as ind2 ... group by ind1, ind2 codepre  pThis will get very unwieldly as we add more and more independent variables.p

So, even for very sparse graphs I get very dark images.p  pMy script is the followingp  precodeset terminal png size 800,800 set output output.png set xrange [] set yrange [] reverse set format y  set format x  unset xtics unset x2tics unset ytics unset y2tics plot data.dat using 21 with dots lc rgb 000000 notitle codepre  pI have thought of using every to take a sample of the graph but I am not sure how I can choose an appropriate step. Using nodespixels for step creates a graph sparser than what I expected. Another idea is to use a heat map with colors making up for the shortage of pixels. However, I am not aware of how to create a heat map with gnuplot, since all the examples I find online seem to use a matrix for input while I use points for plotting.p  pCan someone provide me with an example for a heat map with points instead of a matrix as input or justify which step would be appropriate for use in order to get a good representationp

Negative 70310 pIm trying to understand about data structure and ADT.

But some books or resources say that stack is a collection, and the other resources say stack is data structure. Im very confused all the differences, and am lost at how stack can be implemented with linkedlist. p  pCould anybody explain to make it more clear to me I know it would be very basic question, but Im really in need to understandp  pThank you so muchp

Negative 70310 pI am using VS2012 for a course project that we started from scratch, We are to use C to create something like this I think the aggregation part is reversedp  pa hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsw2zh7yltbups6cmclass.png relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comsw2zh7yltbups6cmclass.pngap  pWell , we had that on paper , wrote the code for each class with no problems, except we cant test because each class depends on another that was not finished at the time. Long story short  each class has its own untested code and VS does not detect any errors whatsoever and based on our previous experience we know that the code is correct, no syntax errors anyway.p  pWhen I start compiling some 500 errors come out of nowhere , some of them it says in time.h , I thought it was something wrong with the compiler , tried switching to CB and see if it work but i needed a different compiler and I dont have the time to download any large files ,seriously , deadline in 2 days and internet speed sucks.p  pdoing some research here and googling around I narrowed it down to cyclic dependencies and I learned that I can draw the diagram in VS and get code files , unfortunately it does it in C while I have a C code it has to be C .p  pHow can I realize this diagram in C  Which class should include which headers  How can I avoid this in the future p  hr  pEDIT Solved it by removing all dependencies and disabling precompiled headers Dont really know if I had to , then I included each .h in its corresponding .cpp , then I included in each .h every header it needs to use. All that did not really solve my problem , it was the declarations  I did ifndef emmyclassem , define emmyclassem to each header and declared the used classes , I think its whats called Forward Declaration correct me if Im wrong Anyway it finally compiled and I will start testing .p  pIf you have any remarks then by all means , you can add them.p

Negative 70310 pCan PAPI be used to profile various events like cache hits, misses for a C program. I plan to write a code uing PAPI much more like a profiler so that it will attach itself or monitor an already running C program.

Is this possible in PAPI I know PAPI can be attached to a process, but will it correctly monitor the performance if the program creates child processp

Negative 70310 pI am working on software that accepts incoming TCP connections and have come across something that I dont understand. First, I will explain what the software is basically doing. Keep in mind that some of the parts are temporary, I understand this is most likely a poor way of doing things, but during prototyping I have run across this issue.p  pI have the main process establish a signal handler for SIGINT. The main process then starts a new thread, call it the listener, with pthreadcreate defaults. The listener first opens a socket, binds, listens, and sets the socket nonblocking. Then the listener will poll the socket with select, waiting for incoming connections.p  pNow, if I have a dumb while1 loop in the main thread, I am able to connect to the socket without issue. The problem is if I replace the while1 loop with a pause, I can no longer connect to the socket. I know the listener thread is still active through log messages. Again, I dont plan on using the pause but I would just like to know what is going on.p  pIs pause blocking a certain signal from reaching the child threadp  pstrongUPDATEstrong The stripped down code I have provided does not seem to exhibit the same behavior. I will update again if I can determine the cause.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong I figured out the issue. There was one critical difference between the code I posted and my problem code. Here are the differencesp  precodestatic void listenerthreadvoid arg      int listenport  int arg     int listenfd     fdset readSet     int fdsMax, status     struct timeval timeout      ifopenlistenportlistenport, amplistenfd  1 codepre  p...p  precodeint startlistenerthreadint port      int status  0      if0 gt pthreadcreateampthreadid, NULL, listenerthread, void ampport codepre  pAnd in main.cp  precode    if0  status ampamp 1  startlistenerthread3000 codepre  pSo you can see I was passing the port number to the thread as a pointer to a stack location. Not a good idea. The strange thing is that it would work if I changed the pause to a while1 loop. And with pause the port number just happened to be a valid port.p  pAllocating space for the port number in startlistenerthread solves the issue.

Its because I create an entirely separate Kitchen object when I bind the closure. What Im having trouble with is figuring out what to pass into codeclosurebindcode to say bind to my parent or if what Im doing is even possible.  Any thoughts  p  pThanks.p  pstrongEditstrong For those of you who shared your concern about this technique, I understand that this breaks encapsulation and is not recommended.  For now, this is a proof of concept.  The situation is that I have a Wordpress plugin that has functionality that Id like to extend. This part of the plugin has no hooks so Im trying to find other ways to extend it.  One of the variables is private and I need to check it to determine whether to call the parent method or to use my custom logic.  I know that this sounds dubious, and I will treat this as a gum and duct tape endeavor. I am planning on reporting to  the plugin developer what Ive tried and what could make the plugin easier to work with.p

Negative 70310 pI have a onclick event in the main window. On clicking, a popup is opened using codewindow.opensomeurl.comcode. In the popupsomeurl.com there is a clickable item. When that item is clicked it opens the url in a new tab. When that new tab is now closed the popup windows does not remain in focus. Instead the main window is in focus and the popup goes behind the main window. What I want is, when the tab which is opened from the popup is closed the popup should get focus and not the main window. Is that possible Please help me in how to achieve this The important thing is, I do not have control on the popup url. It is an external url which is not in my control. Thank you,p

Negative 70310 pI can start 2 projects with jetty on different port numbers over HTTP with jsp, servlet and a common data storage hibernate. One of the projects is public web port 8080 and the other project is admin web port 8899 where the admin web uses spring security for login  logout. But when I make an insert from public web port 8080 which doesnt use spring security, the session with spring security with port 8899 gets broken and I get logged out and must log in again to see the update from the public web on port 8080. The 2 projects have the same context foo in the maven jetty plugin configuration but on different ports so the behavior is somewhat unexpected. If I use 2 different context e.g. foo on port 8080 and zar on port 8899 then the spring security session persists. Is there some reason for why the configuration cant have identical context for different ports or something else that is an explanation for why a user gets logged out after a database insert at another port number with another project p

Negative 70310 pAt my work we use a batch file for restarting services in the evenings. But there are a few issues. 1 is that when the batch runs, in the command prompt theres an error message that says codeERROR The process nameofservice.exe not found.code A couple of times and then it closes and finishes. This isnt too big of an issue but Ive noticed that in some cases that error message will display continually and it never closes.p  pThe other issue I run into, and too my knowledge this has only started happening recently, is that the batch script is running continually.

Negative 70310 pIm trying to make a POST request of XML data with CakePHP 2.3.8, but Im having some issues and I think its dealing with authorization. First of all, what Im trying to do is make a POST request with XML data from an action in a controller.

Nothing is being saved.p  pHere are the two actions and the beforefilter.

Negative 70310 pI have just started using Enthought Canopy v1.4.9 64 bit for Windows instead of IDLE.  I am a complete beginner and teaching myself python from various online courses.p  pWhen I run scripts in IDLE the output scrolls to the bottom of the IDLE screen, so if I am asking for rawinput multiple times the user can see what input is being asked for each time and just enter it without having to manually scroll down to the bottom of the output before entering their input.  However, in Canopy the output does not scroll all the way to the bottom of the Python window.p  pIs there any command I can put in a script to tell if to automatically scroll to the bottomp  pIve tried to search for how to do this online but could only find tutorials on setting up scroll bars.p

That is how it should be. The problem is that codeinColorcode attribute should not ever interfere with lights, as it wouldnt ever even run if lights are enabled. You can also see that nothing in the image is red, which means in this scene codeenColorEnabledcode is always codefalsecode. So codeinColorcode is totally useless here, yet it causes bugs in places it logically shouldnt.  On codeNvidiacode it works fine and green areas draw with or without codeinColorcode.  p  pAm I using something codeAMDcode doesnt support Am I using something outside codeGLSLcode spec I know codeAMDcode is stricter with codeGLcode spec than codeNvidiacode, so its possible I do something undefined. I made the code as simple as possible and still have the problem, so I dont see it.br Also, I noticed that it wont draw ANYTHING even blue areas on the screen if codeinColorcode vertex attribute is disabled no codeglEnableVertexAttribArraycode, but why I dont even use the color. Disabled attributes need to return code0,0,0,1code by the spec right I tried using codeglVertexAttrib4fcode to change that color, but still got black. Compiler and linker doesnt return any errors or warnings. Attribute inColor is found just fine with codeglGetAttribLocationcode. But as I said, nothing of this should matter, as that branch is never executed in my code. Any ideasp  pTested on codeNvidia660Ticode and works fine, tested on codeATIcode codemobility radeon HD 5000code laptop and have this error. My only idea was that maybe I exceed the capabilities of the codeGPUcode too many attributes and so on, but when I reduced my code to this then I stopped believing that. I use only 3 attributes here.br Also, some of my friends tested on much newer codeAMDcode cards and got the same problem.p  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pVertex attributes are bound like sop  precodeif useColors    glUniform1iunicolorEnable,1      glEnableVertexAttribArrayattcolor    glVertexAttribPointerattcolor, 4, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, GLTRUE, STRIDE, OFFSEToffset else    glUniform1iunicolorEnable,0    codepre  pAlso, I found how to show the weirdness even easier  take this vertex shaderp  precodevoid main     vColor  clampvec41.,1.,1.,1.  vec40.5,0.5,0.25,1.,0.0,1.0  inColor     glPosition  modelViewProjectionMatrix  vec4 inPosition.xyz, 1.0     vTextureCoord  inTextureCoord  codepre  pSo no branching. And I get this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comACbBB.png altWithout branching there is still that bug If I change that code by removing codeinColorcode like sop  precodevoid main     vColor  clampvec41.,1.,1.,1.  vec40.5,0.5,0.25,1.,0.0,1.0     glPosition  modelViewProjectionMatrix  vec4 inPosition.xyz, 1.0     vTextureCoord  inTextureCoord  codepre  pI get this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMmkLC.png altWithout branching as expectedp  pThis last one is what I expect, but the previous one doesnt draw anything even though I do addition codecode instead of anything else. So if codeattribcode is not bound and code0,0,0,0code or code0,0,0,1code is given, then it shouldnt have done anything. And yet it still fails.p  pAlso, all logs are empty  compilation, linking and validation. No errors or warnings.  Though I noticed that the shader debug info codeAMDATIcode gives is vastly inferior to what codeNvidiacode gives.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pThe only fix I found was to enable codeattribarraycode in all cases so it basically sends junk to codeGPUcode when color is not enabled, but as I use a uniform to check for color, then I just dont use it. So its like thisp  precodeif useColors    glUniform1iunicolorEnable,1   else    glUniform1iunicolorEnable,0    glEnableVertexAttribArrayattcolor glVertexAttribPointerattcolor, 4, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, GLTRUE, STRIDE, OFFSEToffset codepre  pI have no idea on why that is happening or why I need to use this. I dont need that on codeNvidiacode. So I guess this is slower and I am wasting bandwidth But at least it works... Help on how to do this better would be useful though.p

Negative 70310 pof course Im not the first one to develop such a game. But I want to become professional with game development within in the next years. I want to implement a shootem up game. It is not my first one. I developed one in Turbo Pascal 6.0 in 1998. But without using OOP. This game will be my 2nd shootem up in Java, but the 1st one using LWJGL. It will be implemented in 2D.p  pI want to keep it quite simple. But there are some features I wanna implement. I plan to make 10 Levels. The player has a spaceship he can move in four directionsup, down, left right. The ship has a doublelaser which can be shoot only upwards. The ship can only be moved, I dont plan any rotation. p  pOne level has several enemies of the same kind. The enemies are also spaceships. The most simple ships just move downwards. The also are firing single or double laser bullets. There lasers have a min. and max. frequency. I want to define a mathematical function which defines how possible it is to have a frequencybetween min and max. p  pThe ship speed is constant within an enemy and level. In later levels the enemies gain double or 2,5x speed. Enemies in later levels have lasers which seek the players ship. I plan to have one enemy in lategame which has growing laser bullets.p  pThere are no other obstacles within each level. Each level has some stars as a background. First I want to implement a static background, later I plan to make 3 kinds of stars which are moving at different speed.p  pThe players ships laser does single or double damage, depending on if one or two bullets hit. The enemies have some hitpoints til they die. The player ships has also some hitpoints til it dies.p  pI want to have two kinds of explosionsconsisting of some concetrally spreading ellipses with colors from yellow to red. A small explosion  for laser hits. And a big explosion von ship destruction.p  pMy friend told me that there is a function which is called 60 times per second which renders the graphical objects. So I think within this function I draw all the objects and do nothing more. But of course the coordinates of ships and lasers change. p  pSo I am think if I should use threads or not.p  pIf I would use threads I would assign every ship which appears concurrently to one thread, and make threads for every laser and later for the dynamic background. In another thread I would wait for keyboard input.p  pOf course there is a tradeoff between using threads or not.p  pUsing threads leeds to realistic parallelism and may be necessary to have a flowing game. But avoiding threads would lead to simpler programming, not regarding concurrent access to data. So I ask all  of you experienced game developers. Would you use threads or not And If you would use them, is my conception good or not. And why I am also happy about other practical hints.p  pThank youp

Negative 70310 pI have codeipython notebookcode running on a remote server, i.e.p  precodeipython notebook profilenbserver codepre  pwhich I access from my local machine.

But when I want to cycle through the history in codeterminalcode using kbdUpkbd, it only shows the commands which have been typed in the terminal, i.e codeb2code. Similarly, I am unable to use codeacode  kbdPageDownkbd in the terminal, to go back in history and find the command starting with codeacode.p  pFrom what I understand, my two clients are using two separate history files codehistory.sqlitecode. But why does codehistorycode show all commands p  pstrongQuestionstrong  Is there any way to configure using one codehistory.sqlitecode for both  clients p  pI find, having easy access to history is absolutely crucial. Moreover, I see using both terminal and browser as complementary, they both have tradeoffs and are best used combined.p

Negative 70310 pPreface Ive looked over other posts about multiproject debugging, and Ive found recommendations to configure multiple startup projects. Unfortunately, this doesnt fit the bill for my scenario.p  pIm working on a C project VS 2005, Win7 32bit made up of 3 solutions, each containing around 40 projects. I want to debug the ENTIRE application at runtime, but heres the problem after the firstmain solution is started, 5 to 10 seconds must elapse before starting 2nd solution, followed by another lapse before the 3rd solution is started. These time lapses are necessitated by runtime initializations that must complete in each solution before the next can be started. Clear as mudp  pDoes anyone know how I can accomplish the above AND allow the lapses to occur I cant manually Attach to Process because Im trying to debug each solutions 1st and 2nd class as theyre instantiated. I was hoping VS 2005 had an option to run a particular DLL in debug mode when an EXE starts, but if such a feature exists I cant find it. I recall being able to do this many moons ago in VS 6.0. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 70310 pWhich is the best way to share the functionality of a service between controllers but serve different data to each controllerp  pIve found that keeping data persistence in a service is a great solution to release the controllers from potentially duplicated logic. But if I need another controller to use the service then data will be shared between controllers.p  pWhat is the best way to serve different data to different controllers from the same service Ive thought of something similar to the Observer pattern. The service would keep a collection of the controllers and create an instance of the data for each.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 70310 pI rolled my own restful services and JSON parsing and am hoping to switch to Retrofit.  Currently my activity sends an intent to a service to fetch the necessary data.  The result is passed to a receiver which handles the parsing.  Im not sure how to do this with Retrofit, since services cant return complex objects.  Of course I could convert my objects back to a string so they can be bundled up, but this defeats the entire point of using Retrofit with GSON.p  pIs there a clean way to do this  I like how my current implementation kept my Activity clean from knowing about the end point and data parsing.p  pThanksp

Negative 70310 pI have transactional, private queue I use to send updates to a CRM system. A handful of update messages basically clogged up the queue yesterday. After some research, I found that these bad messages were taking a couple minutes to fail, in the worst case.p  pI have it configured so that these bad messages get moved to the Retry subqueue. After that, they automatically get moved back to the main queue after 5 seconds. However, my expectation was that they would get placed in the back of the main queue.p  pI wrote a console application to inspect messages from the queue. There were about 30 messages stuck in the queue. I was surprised to see the same 45 messages showing up in my console application. These were the same 45 messages that were taking a long time to run and eventually error out.p  pI guess my expectation was that MSMQ was a FIFO queue. However, it appears the same handful of messages are getting processed over and over. So, even though there are about 25 messages that would succeed, they are never getting the chance to run.p  pI am using transactions, but the other 25 messages arent part of the same transaction as the handful that are failing, so I wouldnt think order would matter. All the messages are small and simple  I think the CRM system is just having performance issues.p  pSo, was I wrong in assuming that messages would be processed in order Is there a way to make sure messages have to go to the back of the queue when they are retriedp

Negative 70310 pIm trying to implement an efficient and error free way to perform downcasting of a codeuniqueptrltBasegtcode to a derived class codeuniqueptrltDerivedgtcode. Reading some posts I found that something like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17417848stduniqueptrwithderivedclassthisa can work simple dynamiccast. However, in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21174593downcastinguniqueptrbasetouniqueptrderivedthis other posta they say that to perform the downcasting properly the deleter has to be extracted and reassigned. p  pId like to know when it is important to extract the deleter and how should I implement that, since in the answer the just provide the template function with the codeDelcode type, but I dont understand how to use this type in an actual implementation.p  pEDITp  pMore specifically, I do not understand what exactly is the codeDelcode type and how to set it in an actual example.

The web page shows a video along with associated text and allows the user to click on a text selection to hearwatch that portion of the video as many times as they want good for learning a foreign language. I use the player.seekToseconds, allowSeekAhead function to move forward and backward in the video.p  pThe seekTo function works fine on my desktop in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE as well as on my own Android phone Samsung A5 in both the stock WebView browser as well as Chrome video starts playing from the requested point, but when I tried it on some older Android phones LG amp Samsung, the video would start playing further back than the requested time more than 1 secondp  pTo understand what was happening, I set up a test page where I watched the videos time polled the player.getCurrentTime function every 50ms, and when it reaches 10 seconds, I programmatically seekTo 5 seconds. On my phone as well as the desktop browsers the time goes to 5 seconds and then starts incrementing from there. On the older phones, the time will first go to 5 seconds, but then after halfasecond, jump back to 3.125 or so there is a slight variation each time, and then the video starts playing from that point.p  pI checked the userAgent string for the different phones I was using and found that my phone was running Chrome34.0, while the WebKit browser on the older phones were running Chrome30.0.

Negative 70310 pHi it is a little bit general topic but now I come from backend world and have to build front end applications and have some misunderstandings. So lets explain what I understand in building frontend app using bower, Grunt, npm.p  pWhen I build backend app I use emGradleem which has its own dependency manager which is responsible for managing dependencies. OK. But when I want to build frontend application, I have to manage manually all java scripts, css etc. files. p  pSo for that purpose I have to use strongBowerstrong for js managing dependencies, RequireJs for Managing dependencies at runtime, Grunt for copying stuff around, running optimizers, less to css transformations. This tasks have to be triggered on change and all files to be in consistent state and not to copy js files manually and this have to be done on CI serverand in local development am I rightp  pOk but what happens after that.

Negative 70310 pI am constructing a covariance matrix, that I want to use to simulate random values from a multivariate truncated normal distribution using the codertmvnormcode function from codetmvtnormcode package in R.

Negative 70310 pI have been implementing the new Android Design Support Library in my app but I have a question about content padding. Right now, my content cards in a RecyclerView touches the bottom of the Toolbar in an AppBarLayout until the toolbar is scrolled off the screen. I am trying to add a 16dp margin between the two.

Negative 70310 pI have a question about good C style I would like to write a class MyClass which has one or some pointers as members and MyClass is able to allocate memory to this pointers.

In order to distinguesh between copied objects and original objects created by the constructor, I want to use the following codep  precodeclass MyClass  public        MyClass originalPtrthis  data  new char[100000]         MyClass  iforiginalPtr  this delete[] data  private        MyClass originalPtr        char data  shared data not copiable        char otherFeatures[10]  individual data copiable  codepre  pWould this solution using the comparison with the codethiscodepointer a good style for such a purpose e.g. parsing an object by call by value or is it risky Of course, I assume that the original object live always longer than the copied objects.p  pThank youp

Negative 70310 pCurrently developing a 2D gamedev environment with a WrapperGameEngine class combination in Win32 CC language.  As it stands, I use the Wrapper to set up and initialize all items with the Window as well as to initialize the GameEngine class before entering the message loop.p  pTo do this, I redirect Windows messages sent to codeWndProc...code to codeHandleEvent...code methods found in both the Wrapper and the GameEngine classes.  This is done via static, private sharedptrs found in the Wrapper class.  One such pointer points to the contained GameEngine, and the other points to the Wrapper itself.p  pAn example WndProc function may look like thisp  precodeLRESULT CALLBACK WndProcHWND hWindow, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam       Initialize via wrapper, else route to engine     switch msg              case WMCREATE             return GENWrapperGetWrappergtHandleEventhWindow, msg, wParam, lParam             break         default             return GENWrapperGetEnginegtHandleEventhWindow, msg, wParam, lParam  DefWndProc called from this HandleEvent       codepre  pWhere codeGetEnginecode and codeGetWrappercode are static accessor methods that return their respective sharedptr.  p  pWhat Id like to do is incorporate the pImpl idiom in this design.  That is, I want to create a wrapper interface class that removes implementation details from the specific wrapper being used. One of the problems ailing me is that I need or at least think I need that static accessor method for the Wrapper in question.  This is because as I have it each derived Wrapper initializes the window in a gamespecific way, and WndProc needs to know where to forward that initial message, as one can see in the code above.   Of course, the static method is tied to the wrapper class, so codeGetWrappercode would be impossible to put into that interface.p  pEssentially, I want to have the WrapperInterface declared like thisp  precodeclass WrapperInterface  public     static stdtr1sharedptrltWrapperInterfacegt  factory function         createWrapper...  returns pImpl       ... Pure virtuals here                                                                 codepre  pDerive Wrapper publicly from WrapperInterface, and then implement a primitive version of createWrapper more or less like this p  precodestdtr1sharedptrltWrapperInterfacegt WrapperInterfacecreateWrapper...      return stdtr1sharedptrltWrapperInterfacegtnew Wrapper...  codepre  pso I can put this line in WinMainp  precodestdtr1sharedptrltWrapperInterfacegt       WrapperWrapperInterfacecreate... codepre  pAnd still have WndProc be able to forward messages to the Interface methods p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pA thought occurred to me to store a static pointer to the WrapperInterface itself and have createwrapper set that member variable to whatever wrapper the interface is using.  I then eliminated Wrappers static pointer altogether and made the Engine pointer nonstatic.  This somehow feels like cheating, though, as now Im introducing a private member variable into the interface, albeit a static one.  Any thoughts or tips on redesign methods without storing statics would be great  p  pIn any event, thank you all for reading and any advice you may give.p

I tried the control name TextoBox instead, and it also failed. p  pThere is another issue to consider, that even if I manage to get past the above problem, the code from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19215989textboxforpricecashcurrencyoncsharpformata is an event, named after the control name, so I do not think it will work if I apply it to a class or method and call for it.p  pWhile I already do have the solution to what I want, I would like to know if there is a faster way to apply it, which will not add so much lines to my code.

Negative 70310 pUsing CKeditor is it possible to create a template, and only let users edit certain elements in it while keeping the structure intactp  pFor example a header, a subtext, a paragraph and list of items. But they mustnt delete any of these or add other elements.p  pThe use case is that users have to create a bunch of documents that has to look a certain way. They arent allowed to veer from the standard layouts.p  pOr is that use case beyond the scope of the editor I cant seem to find examples of this in their documentation.p  pThe alternative could be to create custom forms in html on the left side of the page and simultaneously update a read only document on the right side of the page so that they can preview the final document in CKeditor.p  pThough just letting users edit a locked template would be a smoother experience.p  pThanks in Advancep

Negative 70310 pIm using a variant of this code to slighty rotate a codeUIButtoncode about its centerp  precodeCGFloat jiggleAngle  MPI  2.0  1.0  64.0 self.transform  CGAffineTransformRotateself.transform, jiggleAngle codepre  pThis code generally works as expected and rotates the button inplace, about 12 degrees counterclockwise. However, this only works if I do not reposition the button inside my codelayoutSubviewscode method. If I do any repositioning of the button at all from its initially laidout location, the attempt to rotate above results in the buttons disappearance. If the angle I choose for rotation is an exact multiple of 90 degrees, the rotation works somehow even after a move in codelayoutSubviewscode.p  pI understand that my buttons transform is being altered in codelayoutSubviewscode and this results in the subsequent weirdness when I attempt to rotate it with the above code. I have currently worked around this problem by placing the button I wish to rotate inside another codeUIViewcode and then moving that view around as desired, but Id like a better solution that doesnt require redoing my screen layouts.p  pHow can I adjustalter my buttons transform after a move, so that this rotation code continues to work as expectedp

I can simulate, as belowp  precodeif definedCPP11autotypeinference ampamp definedCPP11rangebasedforloops   for autoamp it  args  else   stdvectorltstdstringgtconstiterator vit, vend   for vendargs.end,vitargs.begin vit  vend vit      stdstring itvit endif     stdcout ltlt Processing  ltlt it ltlt  ltlt stdendl     . . .    codepre  p... but Im emreally hopingem that is not the answer.p  pWhat is the C98 equivalent of codefor autoamp it  veccode, or is it not possible  Is it only possible to simulate it but dereferencing the iterator and creating a copy each iterationp  pAnd if that be the case, is that what is going on under the covers with C11 codeautoampcode syntax   I have to believe this is emnot the caseem.  In any case, is it more costly to use codefor autoamp it  veccode than codefor auto it  veccodep  pThank you in advance for your insight.p
Negative 70310 pI have a 4 node  hadoop distributed cluster including hbase set up like this.p  ul listrongnode1strong namenode  hbase master  zookeeperli listrongnode2strong resourcemanager li listrongnode3strong datanode1hbase regionserver1nodemanagerli listrongnode4strong datenode2hbase regionserver2nodemanagerli ul  pCluster set up seems to be fine , as all the WEB UIs hbase, namenode, resource manager  are coming up . Now when I am trying to submit a mapreduce job which readswrites hbase tables , it gets hanged. It keeps getting timeedout strongHowever same job is working fine , in case I explicitly mention hbase credentials in my mapreduce code and set them in jobstrongp  precodeConfiguration conf   HBaseConfiguration.create conf.sethbase.zookeeper.quorum, 10.211.55.101 conf.sethbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort,2181 conf.sethbase.master, 10.211.55.10160000 10.211.55.101 is the ipaddress of node1 codepre  pThese properties are already set in hbase configuration on node1 , node3 and node4.  Now my question is strongDo I need to set up anything with regards to hbase configs on node2 where only resource manager is running  Why the same job is working fine when hbase configs are set in code explicitystrongp
