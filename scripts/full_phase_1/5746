Positive 5746 pI am making a math program that allows the user to input an equation and the program will solve it.  I am trying to make it as user friendly as possible.

Positive 5746 pI am building a website LAMP stack with an Amazon RDS MySQL instance as the back end type db.m3.medium.p  pI am happy with database integrity, and it works perfectly with regards to SELECTJOINETC queries everything is normalized, indexed, and foreign keyed, all tables have id primary keys and relevant secondary keys  unique keys.p  pI have a table dfproducts with approx half a million products in it. The products need to be updated nightly. The process involves a PHP script reading over a large products datafile and inserting data into several tables products table, productcolours table, brands table, etc, calling either INSERT or UPDATE depending on whether or not a row already exists. This is done as one giant transaction.p  pWhat I am seeing is the UPDATE commands are sufficiently fast 50sec, not exactly lightning but it should do, however the INSERT commands are super slow 1sec and appear to be consuming 100 of the CPU. On a dual core instance we see 50 CPU use i.e. one full core. I assume that this is because indexes 1x PRIMARY  5x INDEX  1x UNIQUE  1x FULLTEXT are being rebuilt after every INSERT. However I though that putting the entire process into one transaction should stop indexes being rebuilt until the transaction is committed.p  pI have tried setting the following params via PHP but there is negligible performance improvementp  precodethisgtdbgtquerySET uniquechecks0 thisgtdbgtquerySET foreignkeychecks0 codepre  pThe process will take weeks to complete at this rate so we must improve performance. Google appears to suggest using LOAD DATA. Howeverp  ul liI would have to generate five files in order to populate five tablesli liThe process would have to use UPDATE commands as opposed to INSERT since the tables already existli liI would still need to loop over the products and scan the database for what values already do and dont existli ul  pThe database is entirely InnoDB and I dont plan to move to MyISAM I want transactions, foreign keys, etc. This means that I cannot disable indexes. Even if I did it would probably be a big performance drain as we need to check if a row already exists before we insert it, and without an index this will be super slow.p  pI have provided the products table defition below for information.

Positive 5746 pI recently discovered an error in a client API. It sends pages of unique records based on timestamps. Every so often, it will send the same exact record on end of the previous page, and start of the next page.p  pI was operating under the assumption that there were no duplicates This is an event log after all. Therefore I was doing pure inserts, instead of going through the trouble of an update or some sort of on duplicate step.p  pMy question is  whats the best way to get rid of these duplicates, and then have MS SQL quietly discard these duplicate records upon insert They are definitely inserted AFTER the original has been written in a transaction. These duplicates happen once every 10,000 rows  so something very memory light would be great.p  pThe only distinct part of the records is the ETL batch ID  everything else is identical. Otherwise each record is supposed to have a unique event id. If I make this event id a unique index key, can I somehow force MS SQL to dump any duplicate keys Or will the application throw an error message and stop during the queryp

Negative 5746 pI have a number of events that happen in a game. I want to control the time and order at which these events occur. p  pFor examplep  pEvent 1 Show some text on screen for N frames amp play a sound effectp  pEvent 2 Clear the text on the screenp  pMy solution maybe there is a better one, is to have a list of functions that contain the events. The events perform their behavior then return the next events to occur in the game. I thought of using List.map or List.collect because I am essentially mapping a list of events to a new list of events while performing some behavior code.p  pIn the example above, Event1 can be composed of two functions One that shows text and one that plays a sound hence the need for a list. The function that shows text would return a copy of itself for N1 frames then it would return Event2 which clears the text. The play sound function would return the equivalent of a noop.p  pIf this is a good solution, I could probably do it in C or C. My goal is to do an equivalent or better solution in F.p

Negative 5746 pJust wondering how how people handle Authorization when using MVVM andor View Models. p  pIf I wasnt using VMs I would be passing back the Model and it would have a property which I could check if a user can edit a given objectproperty but when using MVVM I am disconnecting myself from the business object... and thus doent know what the security should be any more.p  pIs this a case where the mapper should be aware of the Authorization that is in place and dont copy across the data if the Authorization check fails. If this was the case I am guessing that the mapper would have to see some properties on the VM to let the interface know which fields are missing data because of the Authorization failure. p  pIf this does occur within the mapper, how does this fit in with things like AutoMapper, etc.p  pCheers Anthonyp

Negative 5746 pI always thought of a Join in SQL as some kind of linkage between two tables.p  pFor example, p  precodeselect e.name, d.name from employees e, departments d    where employees.deptID  departments.deptID codepre  pIn this case, it is linking two tables, to show each employee with a department name instead of a department ID.  And kind of like a linkage or Union sideway.p  pBut, after learning about inner join vs outer join, it shows that a Join Inner join is actually an intersection.p  pFor example, when one table has the ID 1, 2, 7, 8, while another table has the ID 7 and 8 only, the way we get the intersection isp  precodeselect  from t1, t2 where t1.ID  t2.ID codepre  pto get the two records of 7 and 8.  So it is actually an intersection.p  pSo we have the Intersection of 2 tables.  Compare this with the Union operation on 2 tables.  Can a Join be thought of as an Intersection  But what about the linking or sideway union aspect of itp

Negative 5746 pHeres a tricky one  how do I programatically create and interrogate a database whose contents I cant really foreseep  pI am implementing a generic input form system. The user can create PHP forms with a WYSIWYG layout and use them for any purpose he wishes. He can also query the input.p  pSo, we have three stagesp  ol lia form is designed and generated. This is a oneoff procedure, although the form can be edited later. This designs the database.li lisomeone or several people make use of the form  say for daily sales reports, stock keeping, payroll, etc. Their input to the forms is written to the database.li liothers, maybe management, can query the database and generate reports.li ol  pSince these forms are generic, I cant predict the database structure  other than to say that it will reflect HTML form fields and consist of a the data input from collection of edit boxes, memos, radio buttons and the like.p  pQuestions and remarksp  pA how can I best structure the database, in terms of tables and columns What about primary keys My first thought was to use the control name to identify each column,  then I realized that the user can edit the form and rename, so that maybe name becomes employee or wages becomes salary. I am leaning towards a unique number for each.p  pB how best to key the rows I was thinking of a timestamp to allow me to query and a column for the row Id from Ap  pC I have to handle column renameinsertdelete. Foe deletion, I am unsure whether to delete the data from the database. Even if the user is not inputting it from the form any more he may wish to query what was previously entered. Or there may be some legal requirements to retain the data.  Any gotchas in column renameinsertdeletep  pD For the querying, I can have my PHP interrogate the database to get column names and generate a form with a list where each entry has a database column name, a checkbox to say if it should be used in the query and, based on column type, some selection criteria. That ought to be enough to build searches like position  senior salesman and salary  50k.p  pE I probably have to generate some fancy charts  graphs, histograms, pie charts, etc for query results of numerical data over time. I need to find some good FOSS PHP for this.p  pF What else have I forgottenp  pThis all seems very tricky to me, but I am database n00b  maybe it is simple to you gurusp  hr  pEdit please dont tell me not to do it. I dont have any choice p  pEdit in real life I dont expect column renameinsertdelete to be frequent. However it is possible that after running for a few months a change to the database might be required. I am sure this happens regularly. I fear that I have worded this question badly and that people think that changes will be made willynilly every 10 minutes or so. p  pRealistically, my users will define a database when they lay out the form. They might get it right first time and never change it  especially if they are converting from paper forms. Even if they do decide to change, this might only happen once or twice ever, after months or years  and that can happen in any database.p  pI dont think that I have a special case here, nor that we should be concentrating on change. Perhaps better to concentrate on linkage  whats a good primary key scheme Say, perhaps, for one text input, one numerical and a memop

Negative 5746 pIm trying to provide live parsing of a file upload in CGI and show the data on screen as its being uploaded.p  pHowever, Apache2 seems to want to wait for the full POST to complete before sending the CGI application anything at all.p  pHow can I force Apache2 to stop buffering the POST to my CGI applicationp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIt appears that its actually the output of the CGI thats being buffered.  I started streaming the data to a temp file to watch its progress.  That, and I have another problem.p  p1 The output is being buffered.  Ive tried SetEnvIf and simply SetEnv for nogzip, nogzip, and gzip without success within the CGI Directory definition.p  p2 Apache2 appears to not be reading the CGIs output until the CGI process exits  I notice that my CGI app flushing or not is hanging up permanently on a fwrite..., stdout line at around 80K.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOkay, Firefox is messing with me.  If I send a 150K file, then theres no CGI lockup around 80K.  If the file is 2G, then theres a lockup.  So, Firefox is not reading the output from the server while its trying to send the file...  is there any header or alternate content type to change that behaviorp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOkay, I suppose the CGI output lockup on big files isnt important actually.  I dont need to echo the file  Im debugging a problem caused by debugging aids.  p  pI guess this works well enough then.  Thanksp  pstrongFINAL NOTEstrongp  pJust as a note...  the reason I thought Apache2 was buffering input was that I always got a ContentLength environment variable.  I guess FireFox is smart enough to precalculate the content length of a multipart form upload and Apache2 was passing that on.  I thought Apache2 was buffering the input and reporting the length itself.p

Currently, my code looks like this more or lessp  precodepublic override bool LoadXElement source      return new ListltFuncltXElement, boolgtgt              i gt this.LoadHelperi.ElementUser.XMLUsername, ref this.username, User.FailureUsername,         i gt this.LoadHelperi.ElementUser.XMLPassword, ref this.password, User.FailurePassword         there are many more invokations of LoadHelper to justify this architecture          .AsParallel     .Alli gt i.Invokesource   private bool LoadHelperXElement k, ref string index, string failure      if k  null ampamp k.Value  failure              index  k.Value         return true          return false  codepre  pcodethis.usernamecode is a private member variable that is used by the property codethis.Usernamecode. This is the current solution I have for this problem, but Im facing one major issue Since I cannot pass the property itself to the codeLoadHelpercode and codeActionltstringgtcode doesnt match the property , Im circumventing the property setter logic right now. p  pFor your own musings, before the codeLoadHelpercode abstraction, each of my codeListltFuncltXElement, boolgtgtcodes entries looked like this... p  precodei gt FuncltXElement, boolgtk gt  if k  null  k.Value  User.FailureUsername return false                       this.Username  k.Value return true  .Invokei.ElementUser.XMLUsername, codepre  pQuestion Does anyone know any way to do this without circumventing the propertys setter logicp

Negative 5746 pI have this situation where we have media files stored on a global CDN. Our web app is hosted on its own server and then when the media assets are needed they are called from the CDN url. Recently we had a page where the user can download file attachments, however some of the file types were opening in the browser instead of downloading such as MP3. The only way around this was to manually specify the HTTP response to attach the file but the only way I could achieve this was to download the file from CDN to my server and then feed it back to the user, which defeats the purpose of having it on the global CDN.

Negative 5746 pI would like to have an iterator that can be read by multiple threads concurrently so that I can process the data of the iterators source in parallel. The challenge is that I cant really couple codehasNextcode with its logical codenextcode as those could go to different threads. That is, two threads can call codehasNextcode, each see true, and then have the second thread fail because there was only one item. My problem is that for some sources I dont really know if it has a next element until I try to read it. One such example is reading lines from a file another is reading codeTermcode instances from a Lucene index. p  pI was thinking of setting up a queue inside the iterator and feeding the queue with a separate thread. That way, codehasNextcode is implemented in terms of the queue size. But I dont see how I could guarantee that the queue is filled because that thread could get starved.p  pShould I ignore the Iterator contract, and just call codenextcode exhaustively until a codeNoSuchElementExceptioncode is thrownp  pIs there a more elegant way of handling the problem p

Negative 5746 pI have been experimenting with the ReportViewer control in a webforms applications which is running reports remotely through a Report Server. It feels like the Parameter interface in the ReportViewer is limiting. I think another alternative is to create my own web form controls which pass parameters to the ReportViewer and bypass the default parameter interface. My experience with SSRS is very minimal and Im wondering if this is a viable solution, or is it asking for trouble. ie new reports could result in having to create new UIs. I guess my question is whether or not the standard user interface in the report viewer is acceptable for enterprise level applications. Im not talking about the paging controls, more about the drop down lists and check box lists.p

Negative 5746 pIve been told a few times that its bad to use exceptions in javascript. Havent really been told why its bad, but inestead that I should use break, continue and return instead.p  pWhich is fine, except I dont need to returnbreakcontinue, I need to throw. I have a case where I have iterator functions nested in each other, each one returns the next value on call, so I use an exception to indicate that theres nothing more to iterate  seems like a logical way to do it, makes the code clean and works perfectly in practice. Is there really any reason not to use exceptions in jsp  pSecond question, when Im using exceptions, what kind of objects should I throw For errors Ill obviously throw instances of Error, but for special cases stop iteration, etc I needed a quick way to check for those specific exceptions, and what I did is simply define an empty named function function StopIteration and since functions are compared by reference I can always check if its my special case or I should just rethrow. Is there a better or more idomatic way to do this in js Should I really try to refactor my code avoid using exceptionsp  pThank youp

The new content slides in from the right.p  pId like to do this on a browser app on mobile devices. Clicking a link, probably with a certain style attached to it, causes the new page to slide in. The goal is to give the appearance that the page is loading instantly. Therefore hopefully the new page starts loading immediately but the existing page shows that transition during the load.p  pIm not greatly opposed to using Ajax but I thought there were css properties that could allow this. I dont care greatly about the back buttons behavior being animated but I do want it to work properly. Im not using, nor want to use jquerymobile or another mobile framework.p  pAny tips Even knowing the proper search words would be helpful. Thanksp

Negative 5746 pI have a JApplet that is based off an application. I need it to read in a text based file containing all of its data.

I need it for specific actions, like setting lcid cookie for changing default language of site and claims values to user properties mapping.p  pCurrently Im using custom HTTP module, which handles all PostAuthorize web application requests and checks current user and site collection, holds last visited site for each user in collection and fires a custom event for subscribers, when detects transition between site collections.p  pBut I think this approach slows down performance of web application. And from logs I see that there are to many PostAuthorize requests even when user simply clicks a link to page in other site collection. Also, in similar cases sometimes there is a series of requests to next site collection, then to previous, and then again to next. Also there are some issues with SharePoint Designer cant edit page become when this module is active.p  pCould you give me a advice with better approaches for this task Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5746 pIm trying to create a PHP script which pulls xml data text and images from a remote server and inserts it in a local database.

Negative 5746 pIm trying to encode a video with ffmpeg into H.264 via the libx264 library with a constant bit rate.  I know, I know, VBR is often preferred, but for this specific job Im required to use CBR just as long as its so many kilobytes per second it doesnt have to be an exact kilobytes per frame, afaik.  My sample video Im using to test is from here a hrefhttpa1408.g.akamai.net51408138820051104031a1a1ad948be278cff2d96046ad90768d848b41947aa1986sampleiTunes.mov.ziphttpa1408.g.akamai.net51408138820051104031a1a1ad948be278cff2d96046ad90768d848b41947aa1986sampleiTunes.mov.zipa it comes from a hrefhttpsupport.apple.comkbHT1425httpsupport.apple.comkbHT1425ap  pI can get a constant bit rate when encoding the video with MPEG4 Video using the commands codeffmpeg i sampleiTunes.mov b 819968 minrate 819968 maxrate 819968 out.movcode, and the bit rate is as expected.  Reading the videos specs via the QuickTime Inspector, its got a data rate of 844.94 kbits.  Cool.p  pHowever, when I change the codec to libx264, it seems to completely ignore my bitrate requests  The command Im trying is codeffmpeg i sampleiTunes.mov vcodec libx264 vpre medium b 819968 vb 819968 minrate 819968 maxrate 819968 bufsize 400000 test.movcode.  But when I check the videos specs via the QuickTime Inspector, its got a data rate of 254.74 kbits.  WTF  Thats not even closep  pIve tried changing so many parameters and adding tons of different things, and Ive spent 2 days googling this, but I cant seem to get it to work.  If I encode the video with the MainConcept H.264 encoder, I can get a constant bitrate, but I need this to work with ffmpeg.p  pIf someone can help me figure out how to do CBR H.264 encoding with FFmpeg, I will love you foreverp

Negative 5746 pI have a transparent UIView on top of a UIScrollView. The UIView determines whether the scrollview is allowed to scroll or not by checking three touchesMoved events. After the events, I want the view to disable user interaction so scrolling will happen. The user shouldnt even notice the delay.p  pHowever, having set the views userInteractionEnabled to NO, it keeps claiming all touchesMoved events until it is released. This means that the user is forced to let go of the view before being able to scroll.p  pUsing hitTest wont work until the view has been released as well. hitTest does not get called while moving.p  pI would send the touch events to the UIScrollView, but it happily ignores those due to it having its own hidden touch handling.p  pAny way to make the UIView stop claiming touch events without having to let go of itp

Negative 5746 pI have a report that displays a member name in the format of prefix, first, middle, last, suffix. The report code looks like this [nameprefix] [namefirst] [namemiddle] [namelast] [namesuffix]p  pEach field entry has a single space between and works great when the member has a middle name, but when the middle name is Null two spaces render between the first and last names. I tried solving the issue with an expression that looks like thisp  precodeIIFIsNothingFieldsnamemiddle.Value,,Fieldsnamemiddle.Value amp   codepre  pI also adjusted the spacing to look like this [namefirst] [namemiddle][namelast] with no space between the middle and last name field. My hope was that if there was a middle name there would be spaces between the names and when the middle name was null then only one space between first and last name. When there is a middle name it renders correctly but if the middle name is Null there is still an extra space. So I tried another method with no spaces between the fields that looks like thisp  precodeIIFIsNothingFieldsnamemiddle.Value, ,  amp Fieldsnamemiddle.Value amp   codepre  pAgain same issue, works fine where there is a middle name but two spaces when there is not. I have considered concatenating the entire member name but I think I will have the same result. The same report done with Crystal Reports uses the first method and it works without issue. Thank you in advance.p

ITimeoutReceiver mSetter    int cancel        mCancelled  true      if  timeKillEventmTimerID  SUCCESS   Line under question  1              delete this  Timeout instance is selfdestroyed.         return 0  ok. OS Timer resource given back.          return 1  fail. OS Timer resource not given back.       WindowsTimeoutITimeoutReceiver setter, int timerID         mSetter  setter      mTimerID  timerID       class WindowsScheduler      static void CALLBACK timerFunctionUINT uID,UINT uMsg,DWORD dwUser,DWORD dw1,DWORD dw2           WindowsTimeout timeout  WindowsTimeout uMsg      if timeoutgtmCancelled            delete timeout      else           timeoutgtmDestinationgtGENevTimeouttimeout  WindowsTimeout scheduleITimeoutReceiver setter, TimeUnit t              int timerID  timeSetEvent...         if timerID  SUCCESS                       return WindowsTimeoutsetter, timerID                  return 0       codepre  pMy questions arep  pQ.1. When a WindowsSchedulertimerFunction call is made, this call is performed in which context  It is simply a callback function and I think, it is performed by the OS context, right  If it is so, does this calling preempt any other tasks already running  I mean do callbacks have higher priority than any other usertask p  pQ.2. When a timeout setter wants to cancel its timeout, it calls WindowsTimeoutcancel. However, there is always a possibility that timerFunction static call to be callbacked by OS, preempting the cancel operation, for example, just after mCancelled  true statement. In such a case, the timeout instance will be deleted by the callback function.  When the preempted cancel function comes again, after the callback function completes execution, will try to access an attribute of the deleted instance mTimerID, as you can see on the line  Line under question  1 in the code.p  pHow can I avoid such a case  p  pPlease note that, this question is an improved version of the previos one of my own here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9555430windowsmultimediatimerwithcallbackargumentWindows multimedia timer with callback argumentap

Negative 5746 pIm trying to use AVFoundation to have three recording modes Audio, Video and Photo. Audio and Video work just fine, but the problem is, if I set the session preset to AVCaptureSessionPreset352x288, the still pictures are also saved at that resolution. If I change my session preset to AVCaptureSessionPresetPhoto, then the photos look great but the video stops working because that isnt a supported preset for video. Ive tried creating multiple sessions, reassigning the session preset, etc. but nothing seems to work.

Negative 5746 pIve downloaded a webpage html and the images inside it.  Now, im trying to display them to the user.  Ive tried two different methods, and not sure which is best to use.  Both have their issues.p  pFirst, I tried a text view with the following codep  precodeTextView content  TextViewfindViewByIdR.id.articlecontent  MyImageGetter mig  new MyImageGetterthis, urlId Spanned span  Html.fromHtmlcontents, mig, null content.setTextspan codepre  pI really like how this works, except two issues.  The first, and most difficult is when an article has lots of images, I get OutOfMemory fcs.  MyImageGetter code is as followsp  precodepublic class MyImageGetter implements Html.ImageGetter  String urlId  null Context c  null  public MyImageGetterArticleViewer articleViewer, String urlId2      c  articleViewer     urlId  urlId2   public Drawable getDrawableString source      String[] brokenUrl  source.split     String imgName  brokenUrl[brokenUrl.length1]      File image  new Filedatadatacom.that1dev.RibbonReaderOffline  urlId    imgName     Log.wMyApp, image.getAbsolutePath     Bitmap bm  BitmapFactory.decodeFileimage.getAbsolutePath      Drawable d  new BitmapDrawablec.getResources, bm      d.setBounds0,0, d.getIntrinsicWidth,d.getIntrinsicHeight      return d    codepre  pThe other issue is the textview has different widths based on user choice and device orientation.  The images in the view simply get cropped if they are larger than the textview width.  However, I believe I can fix that without too much difficultly on my own.  I just havent tried too hard yet since Im trying to fix the memory issue first.  However, any assistance on either would be much appreciated.p  pThe other method Ive tried is a webview.p  precodeWebView webContent  WebViewfindViewByIdR.id.webcontent  webContent.loadDataWithBaseURL, contents[1], texthtml, utf8,  webContent.setBackgroundColorColor.TRANSPARENT codepre  pUnfortunately with this, the background stays white no matter what I try, and is incredibly ugly.  I cannot seem to find a work around that works in 3.0 and 4.0.p  pIf I had a choice, Id really like the TextView method to work, since I preferred the look of it to the way the WebView rendered things.p

Negative 5746 pI have around 53,00,000 documents in MarkLogic server and I am building a simple search application.

Negative 5746 pOverview Opening db connections in the onStart and in async tasks has gotten to be quite complex. Is it bad practice to have globally available db connections If it is bad what is a better wayp  pDetails I have an application that connects to the sqlite3 database in several activities. At first there werent many places where I needed to access the database so I was just opening and closing each time I needed access. Then there were more places that needed to access it so, as suggested on another Stack Overflow question, I started opening the database connections in the onStart method of the activity that needed a connection and closing it in the onStop method. p  pThis worked fine until I started needing connections in some asynchronous tasks that outlived the activity. Since the onStop method for the activity had been called and connections had been closed, by the time the async task tried accessing the database it was failing. As a solution I created separate connections for each async task that were opened in the onPreExecute method and closed in the onPostExecute method. p  pThis has resulted in a lot of opening and closing of connections, and Im wondering if creating globally available db connections in the application context is a good idea. It would definitely clean up a lot of code and remove any unclosed db exceptions that are happening if I forget to close a connection or the app experiences a force close. Any one else tried this  see any problems with this approachp

Negative 5746 pWhile running a program Ive written in assembly, I get codeIllegal instructioncode error. Is there a way to know which instruction is causing the error, without debugging that is, because the machine Im running on does not have a debugger or any developement system. In other words, I compile in one machine and run on another. I cannot test my program on the machine Im compiling because they dont support SSE4.2. The machine Im running the program on does support SSE4.2 instructions nevertheless.p  pI think it maybe because I need to tell the assembler YASM to recognize the SSE4.2 instructions, just like we do with gcc by passing it the codemsse4.2code flag. Or do you think its not the reason Any idea how to tell YASM to recognize SSE4.2 instructionsp  pMaybe I should trap the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSIGILLSIGILLa signal and then decode the SASIGINFO to see what kind of illegal operation the program does.p

Negative 5746 pI have such a grid square disk. Every grid represents a pixel. My aim is to most accurately aprroximate this disk as a circle max from inside. Radius of the circle should be 1 so I have to define a xy plane whose minimum and maximum values 1, 1 respectively. So pixel 35 is the origin 0,0. By the way I dont want to draw a circle, I just need such a circle which gives me the coordinates of every single pixel.p  pFor example for pixel 3, it should give me a coordinate approximately 0 , 0.8. I can define such a circle, but I am not sure about coordinates. I dont ask any code but some tips or advices would be appreciated. I am also using emgucv library for this project. Should I define this coordinates from scratch or is there any predefined class or something that speed me up.p  pthanksp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRjXpg.png altenter image description herep

Negative 5746 pI have a services table for detailing services that we provide.

However, if a normalized approach to the above data is used, with separate tables and foreign keys for each onetomany relationship, any update on these tables will not be recognised in the history of the service.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions It seems like I need to store child keys in the service table to maintain the integrity of the service history.

Negative 5746 pIm working on signal processing issues. Im extracting some features for feeding a classifier. Among these features, there is the sum of first 5 FFT coefficients. As you know primary FFT coefficients actually indicate how dominant low frequency components of a signal are. This is very close to what a lowpass filter gives.p  pHere Im suspicious about whether computing FFT to take those first 5 coefficients is an unnecessary task. I think applying lowpass filter will just eliminate lowfrequency components and it wont have a significant effect on primary FFT coefficients. However there may be some other way in combination with lowpass filter in order to extract same information that is contained in first five FFT coefficients without using FFT.p  pDo you have any ideas or suggestions regarding this issuep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5746 pIm working on improving a program to utilize statically allocated huge pages in Linux rather than standard 4Kb pages. Ive already set up a system with static huge page support and allocated a large amount of huge pages in the huge page pool provsysvmnrhugepages.

Negative 5746 pCan anyone tell me if it is possible to capture data from the camera on the iPhones that has never been compressedp  pI know that using the AVFoundation framework you can specify the key kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey as kCVPixelFormatType32BGRA and I have done this, but in examing the resulting files, it looks to me like this is just telling the framework to store frame data in BGRA format in the buffer instead of the JPEG format. It appears that the actual data is coming from the compression type specified and is simply JPEG data that has been decompressed into a buffer. When I photograph a text document there are JPEG artifacts surrounding characters. Can anyone tell me if there is a way to specify a noncompressed setting as the compression type or if there is some other method for accessing direct camera output that has never gone through a lossy compression processp

You close the dialog, the list previous page gets reloaded and immediatly the dialog pops up again as if the click event gets triggered again... very strange.p  pI have no clue.p  pThis is an example of an event I use to tell the browser to get the json and display what I need.p  precodedialogzinnl.livepagebeforeshow, functionevent, data  codepre  phere comes all the code that has to happen on this page like getting the right json stuff and appending it to the html...p  pafter that inside this pagebeforeshow I declare my button click events like thisp  precodeexecutesubrubriek.onclick, .selectedzinnl, functionevent                     var selectedzinnl   this.attrselectedzinnl                     .mobile.changePage dialogzinnlcurrentrubriek  currentrubriekid  ampcurrentsubrubriek  currentsubrubriekid  ampcurrentzin  selectedzinnl  ,  role dialog                     codepre  pIf anyone ever came across this same problem or knows whats wrong. Please explain me.p  pThanksp  pemEDITem If I use pageinit I dont have this problem. Though I cannot use pageinit since the content of the page has to be refreshed when a user choses another category for instance.p  pA thought of mine is it possible to call pageinit if the page gets called by the back button and pagebeforeshow if the page is called by another buttonp
Negative 5746 h1Hi allh1  pI have a database table that looks somewhat like this stripped for the sake of clarityp  precodecustomer   name        track   John        one  Sue         two  Greg        one  Loreen      three  Niles       two codepre  pNow, I would like to generate a new color for each unique track by my select statement, something likep  precodeSELECT name, track,   HEXRANDOMBLOB3 AS color FROM customer codepre  pUnfortunately I cant modify the table content or the database structure, hence, Im forced to generate the colors on the fly. The above codeSELECTcode query produces something like thisp  precode name        track        color   John        one          000000  Sue         two          444444  Greg        one          888888  Loreen      three        CCCCCC  Niles       two          FFFFFF codepre  pi.e. a new color for each row. But that is not what I want I want all unique tracks to keep the same color, like sop  precode name        track        color   John        one          000000  Sue         two          444444  Greg        one          000000  Loreen      three        888888  Niles       two          444444 codepre  pi.e. all one tracks should have the 000000 color, all two tracks should have the 444444 color and so on.p  pAs mentioned before I dont have the luxury of altering the database, I can only query it. Also its an SQLite database running on an Android device, so I cant afford those hairy serverside queries either.p  pemMy efforts so faremp  pI have come up with the following query so farp  precodeSELECT a.name, a.track, b.color FROM customer AS a LEFT JOIN      SELECT track,   HEXRANDOMBLOB3 AS color     FROM customer     GROUP BY track AS b ON b.track  a.track codepre  pBut that query is bordering to what Im allowed to do technically and what I am willing to do architecturally. The changes to the codebase required to make such a query in a well defined way is almost more expensive than the result of it would be worth.p  pemstrongSo, what say ye, fellow architectsemstrong How can I make this as efficiently as possiblep

Negative 5746 pNot coming from an MVC background, but just working with php purely, one of the greatest challenges was to grasp frameworks and the MVC ideology. While I am sure many adhere to MCV as the standard way to push code, I lack finding basic introductions into frameworks, and while they also do seem quite tedious to get started with, my goal is purely to write some Python code into html documents. p  pAt first glance Mako seemed as the solution to the problem, allowing me to write the Python code into html, but at second glance it seemed to require more work than just that. p  pWhat I simply cannot find an answer to anywhere I have looked is the whole aspect of howtostart with Mako. p  pLooking at the Mako site this comes up p  precodeltinherit filebase.htmlgt lt rows  [[v for v in range0,10] for row in range0,10] gt lttablegt  for row in rows     makerowrow  endfor lttablegt  ltdef namemakerowrowgt lttrgt  for name in row     lttdgtnamelttdgt  endfor lttrgt ltdefgt codepre  pOnce again I see the entire templating ideology yuk coming up, but I just want to write Python code into my html, period. So some questions that I have are p  ul liOnce Mako is installed can I start putting Python code into HTML and it will work li liIf not, then I assume I need to put the example code from above into a .py file and put base.html in the same directory Or do I put the .py file somewhere elseli liWill this work like CSS in the sense that I inside the html file include a similar fashioned call to the .py file or .mako file or whatever its called. li liSince it sounds frameworkish, will I need to put the html file and the .py.mako in the same directory or will they also have to be separatedli liEDIT I may as well ask if I can then call my extensions .psp even though its not modpython.li ul  pI know many would say that this is stupid and that there are better ways of doing it and that I make a big mistake. But clearly there are no noob tutorials explaining this in finer details, thus leaving to do it the way I see fit, ie. put Python code inside a file and be done with it. p  pI also looked on this modpython, but since it seems as an old solution I would actually like to skip that one. However, I hope there is a new solution to embed Python into HTML. p  pPS. I know all the framework evangelists will jump me, but the intention is not debate how to write code. Since no noobstepbystep tutorial can be found on either Pythons, Djangos  or Makos website and for that matter Pylons, Pyramid etc. it must therefore be assumed that anyone wanting to do this knows their framework implementation methods by heart. But I dont, so I just want to put Python code into HTML and not spendwaste time on learning something that Python already should solve perfectly in the first place. p  pPPS. By noob, I mean I would love to know the basics such as. Take this code and put into this type of file and put that file there. Then take this file and do that. I just could not find this what so ever anywhere. Its like a public secret.....p
Negative 5746 pI have two tricky issues that are intertwined.

Any suggestions on how to make these images clickable but still behind the shadowp  pAlso, Ive read through previous posts about scrolling speed with the box shadows.  Ive made it as small as possible but has anyone figured out how to make that go faster yet  I really like the look but the functionality doesnt work if the scroll is going to be so slow.p  pHere are links to the site as constructed so far.  p  pa hrefhttpwww.officialdesign.comTESTPROJECT.html relnofollowhttpwww.officialdesign.comTESTPROJECT.htmla httpwww.officialdesign.comTESTGRID.htmlp  pPlease be nice  I am a novice at this  Im an architect not a web designer.

Negative 5746 pArchitecturally speaking, a controller does not know about view usually and it certainly doesnt know about some other controllers view. Controllers dont know about other controllers either. Sometimes it is necessary for these loosely coupled components to be able to communicate, but best practice is not to tightly couple them together. Is there a messaging framework plugin that allows different components to emit and receive global messages within the app Is there a better way to handle these kinds of communicationsp

Negative 5746 pIm using the boost filesystem iterator and I have a problem when I try to parse a specific folder. The folder is a remote ftp folder mounted using curlftpfs as root. The same folder can be mounted also as nfs share. If I run my application on the nfs share the iteration works fine, while if I run it on the ftp share I get the exception. The specific folder that causes the crash is the lostfound folder. It seems the root user has no access to it, but while in the nfs share if I try ls mntremotenfslostfound I get a permission denied error, doing ls mntremoteftplostfound I get inputoutput error. While its obvious that the curlftpfs has some problems, since it should return some kind of permission error, boost should not crash in this case.

Negative 5746 pIm using Visual Studio 2008 to compile and debug a plugin for an application that runs under Windows. The plugin has some problem and it crashes. I have been running VS in Debug mode but when the application crashes VS stack trace has nothing from my code. It is possibly the application itself that crashes. So I though I could try to figure out which part of my code does something the host application doesnt like by sprinkling a few print statements here and there in my code. That generally works as expected on nix systems but in Windows I cant find where the output of those print goes. Can anybody point me in the right direction Also, if using prints do debug is too 1970s and somebody knows a better way to figure out where too look when the stack trace doesnt reveal anything interesting please let me know.p

Negative 5746 pI am currently writing a home automation app for a client which will open their garage, turn on the living room and office lights, and other such things when they arrive within 150 meters of their home.

Negative 5746 pI have a mapview on a class where I can go anywhere and can zoom in and can see the whole map. Now I want to know is there is a method to keep track of the zoomed region or map region appearing on the current view, so that when I go to another class I can get the same map on another view the same region.p  pFor Eg In my codeFirstViewControllercode I am on the map and now I zoom in to NorthAmerican region, so now I want that when I move to codeSecondViewControllercode so that I can see the NorthAmerican region i.e the region where I was on the codeFirstViewControllercode before I moved to codeSecondViewcode. Can anyone tell me how this can be done p  pI have to add the annotation pin to the center of the region on SecondView taking into account the view as on the codeFirstViewControllercode i.e if I was in SouthAmerica region then on moving to the SecondView a pin should drop in the center of the map region of SouthAmerica. Can someone guide me how to do this p  pAny Coding will be much helpful .. Thanksp

Negative 5746 pI have a legacy ASP application that I need to release on a modern server. It uses ADO with SQLOLEDB to talk to MS SQL Server. Its logging on to SQL with username and password.p  pThe app relies on a peculiar behavior of the ADO Connection object that seems to have changed. These days in ADODB.Connection.6, when you provide a connection string to a Connection and then retrieve it back, you dont get back an exact copy of the original string specifically, the username and password are stripped from it, and some extra parameters are added.p  pIt looks like older versions of ADO did not strip the credentials in this scenario the application would never work if it did, and it works. Question  is this documented Is there a way to enforce the legacy behavior in new ADOp  pI really dont want to downgrade ADO on a shared server.p  pEDIT just isolated it to a minimal test case. Works on Connection.2.80 on Windows 2003 msado15.dll v. 2.82.5011.0, fails on Connection.6 on Windows 2008 dll v.6.1.7600.17036.p  pEDIT2 officially, the old MDAC 2.8, which ADO is a part of, is not supported on Vista and higher. So downgrade is not really an option.p

Negative 5746 pIm a web developer for my university, currently working on our map. The site can be found a hrefhttpbit.lyTOyCVq relnofollowherea. Under each heading appear the pushpins when the heading is clicked, and when pushpins are clicked on either on the map or in the sidebar an infowindow should pop up with a brief snippet about the location, usually with a photo alongside it. Unfortunately, over the last two months, the infowindows all stopped displaying. Ive tried making sure our jquery is uptodate, and run through the custom javascript we made to see if there have been any significant changes best I can tell, there havent.

If they override this method, theyll probably assume correctly that the codesuperclasscode method should be called in the subclass implementation.p  pHowever, what if they define a method in the subclass private interface which inadvertently has the same name as an unrelated method in the superclass private interface Without them reading the superclass private interface, they wont know that instead of just creating a new method, theyve also overridden something in the superclass. The subclass implementation may end up getting called unexpectedly, and the work that the superclass is expecting to be done when calling the method will not get done.p  pAll of the SO questions Ive read seem to suggest that this is just the way that ObjC works and that there isnt a way of getting around it. Is this the case, or strongcan I do something to protect my private methods from being overriddenstrongp  pAlternatively, strongis there any way to scope the calling of methods from my superclass so I can be sure that the superclass implementation will be called instead of a subclass implementationstrongp

Negative 5746 pI am using Selenium WebDriver in conjunction with java.awt.Robot to better simulate user interaction with our web application. Yes, I know its probably unnecessary, but the customers I serve demand it.  p  pCurrently things are working pretty well, however I have a minor snag in that I cant seem to find a good way to get the web elements on screen position. Things like the title bar, menu bar, navigation bar, etc all push the content down on the physical screen which Robot gets its coordinates from, but has no impact on where Selenium reports the element is.  p  pWhen I call codeelement.getLocationcode on a Selenium WebElement, it always gives me its location relative to the HTML content render pane, not the browser window itself.p  pA better illustration is codedriver.findElementBy.tagNamebody.getLocationcode always returns 0,0, regardless of the windows actual onscreen location.p  pRight now I am hacking it by adding a vertical and horizontal offset after maximizing the window, but these arent the same between different browsers IEs top decorations take up more room then Firefoxs, for example, and may be different for each user if they have bookmark tool bars, search bars, etc added in.p  pYes, I know I could run in full screen mode, but Id rather not, if at all possible.p  pIs there a way to use WebDriver to get the physical onscreen location of elements in a reliable mannerp

Im assuming this is because theres a mystery error somewhere in one of the files above it. The console shows two errors related to elements not being found on that page to be expected, since they are from a different controller.p  pBut, I looked at the production application and the same thing is happening. I am on the pages controller for the homepage, looked at the miniaturized JS file and found references to a completely separate controller. The same errors were also present saying that elements werent found on that page. And again, the JS after that point all failed and arent working.p  pI assumed that Rails only compiled that controllers JS If this isnt the case, how do I go about making it that way so that certain JS only appears on certain pagesp  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 5746 pIn my ASP.NET Web API controller, I want to restrict access to those in the User role.  The common way to do this is to extend the AuthorizeAttribute a hrefhttpleastprivilege.com20120622authorizationinaspnetwebapi relnofollowexamplea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12211904aspnetwebapiauthenticationandvalidationexamplea and then sprinkle my controllers with my custom attribute e.g. [AuthorizeUser].p  pAnother way to do this is to add a function in the controllers constructor.

However, when I stepped through my code in the debugger I found that the constructor method gets fired BEFORE the filter.  p  pTo optimize code, it makes sense to break as soon as possible if the user is not authorized to access the controller.  If Im not mistaken, then, it should be more efficient to perform authorization in the constructors instead of in a filter.  Am I correct or am I missing something herep

Negative 5746 pAccording to google, V8 uses an efficient garbage collection by employing a stoptheworld, generational, accurate, garbage collector.

We may be working on different products such as Acme Widget 1, 2, 3 but all share and work on the Company Shared projects, i.e. Company.Utilities, Company.Windows, Company.Security.p  pCan someone please shed some light on how to properly configure TFS while were early into the stages of use.  We want to go beyond just version control as mentioned above.  We want to use the Task, Bug, Alerts, Build, etc.p  pP.S.  If anyone is a TFS subcontractor that helps organizations configure their TFS setup I would entertain a professional consultation and configuration.p

The page in question can be seen at a hrefhttpsoftcircuits.comclientspacingtest.htm relnofollowhttpsoftcircuits.comclientspacingtest.htma. This is not the original site and will produce some scripting errors, but it shows the layout issue. The original site requires an account.p  pThere is a black 20px bar that runs across the very top of the page, with an image just below that. However, the image is placed about 22px from the top, leaving a 2px margin just below the black bar. After looking at this for a while, I still cannot figure out where this margin is coming from. I would like the image and black areas on the side to be flush up against the black bar.p  pIm testing in Chrome. Would appreciate any tips.p

Negative 5746 pI am having a problem with the class that derives from codeServicecode, which is part of the ServiceStack library. If I setup a separate class that derives from codeServicecode and place the codeGetcode or codeAnycode methods within then everything runs fine, however, the problem is that that class itself does not have reference to any of the business logic. It is fine as long as I return static data but if I want to integrate it into the business logic then that is not working. I want the Get method to be part of the same class in which my business logic lies. Is that bad design and if what can I do to get around it The error I am getting is that the class that derives from codeServicecode gets instantiated for whatever reason which according to my current understanding makes very little sense to me.

Negative 5746 pIm finding the floatingpoint modelerror issues quite confusing. Its an area Im not familiar with and Im not a low level Casm programmer, so I would appreciate a bit of advice.p  pI have a largish C application built with VS2012 VC11 that I have configured to throw floatingpoint exceptions or more precisely, to allow the C runtime andor hardware to throw fpexceptions  and it is throwing quite a lot of them in the release optimized build, but not in the debug build. I assume this is due to the optimizations and perhaps the floatingpoint model although the compiler fpprecise switch is set for both the release and debug builds.p  pMy first question relates to managing the debugging of the app. I want to control where fpexceptions are thrown and where they are masked. This is needed because I am debugging the optimized release build which is where the fpexceptions occur  and I want to disable fpexceptions in certain functions where I have detected problems, so I can then locate new FP problems. But I am confused by the difference between using controlfps to do this which works fine and the compiler and pragma floatcontrol switch fpexcept which seems to have no effect. What is the difference between these two mechanisms Are they supposed to have the same effect on fp exceptionsp  pSecondly, I am getting a number of Floatingpoint stack check exceptions  including one that seems to be thrown in a call to the GDI dll. Searching around the web, the few mentions of this exception seem to indicate it is due to compiler bugs. Is this generally the case If so, how should I work round this Is it best to disable compiler optimizations for the problem functions, or to disable fpexceptions just for the problematic areas of code if there dont appear to be any bad floatingpoint values returned For example, in the GDI call to GraphicsPathGetPointCount that throws this exception, the actual returned integer value seems correct. Currently Im using controlfps to disable fpexceptions immediately prior to the GDI call  and then use it again to reenable exceptions directly after the call.p  pFinally, my application does make a lot of floatingpoint calculations and needs to be robust and reliable, but not necessarily hugely accurate. The nature of the application is that the floatingpoint values generally indicate probabilities, so are inherently somewhat imprecise. However, I want to trap any pure logic errors, such as divide by zero. What is the best fp model for this Currently I amp  ul litrapping all fp exceptions i.e. EMOVERFLOW  EMUNDERFLOW  EMZERODIVIDE  EMDENORMAL  EMINVALID using controlfps and a SIGFPE Signal handler,li lihave enabled the denormalsarezero DAZ and flushtozero FTZ i.e. MMSETFLUSHZEROMODEMMDENORMALSZEROON, andli liI am using the default VC11 compiler settings fpprecise with fpexcept not specified.li ul  pIs this the best modelp  pThanks and regardsp

Negative 5746 pI have gone through my code and tried to make it as efficient as i can think possible. Still i can not get this program to run all the way through without freezing my box.

Negative 5746 pI am new to Javascript and backbone.js, so hopefully I am missing something simple here.  I am experimenting with some sample code I found which is supposed to check for unsaved changes before allowing a user to navigate away to another page.  I have created a JSfiddle herep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netU43T54 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netU43T54ap  pThe code subscribes to the hashchange event like thisp  precodewindow.onhashchange, router.hashChange codepre  pAnd the coderouter.hashChangecode function checks a dirty flag to determine whether or not to allow the navigation, like thisp  precodehashChange function evt      if this.cancelNavigate   cancel out if just reverting the URL         evt.stopImmediatePropagation         this.cancelNavigate  false         return          if this.view ampamp this.view.dirty          var dialog  confirmYou have unsaved changes.

I still plan on serving the full client HTML and JavaScript using node.js, but I would like the client to connect to the C server rather than the node.js server.p  pThe way that Im currently connecting to the server is simply using a socket gained from socket.ios codeio.connectcode.

Here is a piece of the current code.p  precodefrom numpy import  import netCDF4 import os  f  netCDF4.MFDatasetair.2m.1979.nc  atemp  f.variables[air]  ntimes, ny, nx  atemp.shape colddays  zerosntimes, ny, nx, dtypeint  for i in rangentimes   for b in rangeny     for c in rangenx       if i  1           if atemp[i,b,c] lt 0             colddays[i,b,c]  1           else             colddays[i,b,c]  0       else         if atemp[i,b,c] lt 0           colddays[i,b,c]  colddays[i1,b,c]  1         else           colddays[i,b,c]  0 codepre  pThis seems like a brute force way to get the job done, and though it works it takes a very long time.  Im not sure if it takes such a long time because Im dealing with 365 349x277 matrices 35,285,645 pixels or if my old school brute force way is simply slow in comparison to some built in python methods.p  pBelow is an example of what I believe the code is doing.  It looks at Time and increments cold days if temp lt 0.  If temp  0 than cold days resets to 0.  In the below image you will see that the cell at row 2, column 1 increments each Time that passes but the cell at row 2, column 2 increments at Time 1 but resets to zero on Time 2.p  pIs there a more efficient way to rip through this netCDF dataset to perform this type of operation img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcyzxU.png altHere is an example imagep

Negative 5746 pI just have a quick question. Can a table have its only primary key as a foreign key p  pTo clarify. When Ive been creating tables I sometimes have a table with multiple keys where some of them are foreign keys. For examplep  precodecreate table Pet Name varchar20, Owner char1, Color varchar10, primary keyName, Owner, foreign keyOwner referecnes PersonSsn  codepre  pSo now Im wondering if its possible to do something like thisp  precodecreate table WorksAs Worker char1, Work varcahr30, primary keyWorker, foreign keyWorker references PersonSsn  codepre  pThis would result in two tables having the exact same primary key. Is this something that should be avoided or is it an ok way to design a database If the above is not a good standard I would simply make the Work variable a primary key as well and that would be fine, but it seems simpler to just skip if it is not needed. p

Negative 5746 pI have a dataframe which have several columns. I want to extract rows by combination of values from two specific columns, so I use the codesetindexcode property to index the dataframe by those columns.

Negative 5746 pIn an ongoing project there is a need to have multiple finite state machines implemented. A common layer would be nice so that similar checks and balances can be developed. The state machines requirements are diverse enough so I wanted to have data types to be determined outside of the FSM template as a user responsibility. Also I wanted to have persistent data totally controlled by an FSM implementation author. Finally, threadsafety is a must for state transition in the template.p  pThat resulted in what I think is a lean state transition code. The idea is that the FSM template should be both specialized emandem wrapped into a usable outer class by an FSM implementer. That wrapper class will be a full specific FSM implementation. The FSM template uses data types and logic defined outside of it, but those states and data should not be visible outside of that final wrapper implementation of an FSM.p  pA few questions remain I am very green by C standards. Here they arep  ol liIs using codetypeindexcode as a map key in this case an oddity or goes along with codetypeindexcode design intent Is it unique enough for this purposeli liIs that right that the magic of codesharedptrcode will automatically and properly destroy all data instantiated in the wrapper classli liAre there destuction order issue somewhere in this template and implementationli liIs there a way to test proper destruction and its orderli liIs there a way or a reasonable need to test that state transitions actually synchronize in the codeFSMoperatorcode methodli ol  pBelow is the template itself and the main Turnstile class, toughly implementing that from a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFinitestatemachineExampleaturnstile relnofollowthe Wikipedia articlea. The other six implementation files with specific types and state logic are at a hrefhttpsgithub.comdidenkoFSMtreec6b80473071cf906bb86dc525ac7d991b9834e01 relnofollowmy GitHub FSM repositorya if needed.p  pThe FSM template below takes a vector of logic reacting to messages, with the head of the vector defining the initial state. It wraps each message actor in a state object, attaching state data an plumbing to it. When the FSM template runs a state it can also do sanit checks that the returned next state key is valied future, left out for briefness here.p  pHere is the templatep  precodepragma once  include ltmemorygt include ltstringgt include ltvectorgt include ltmapgt include lttypeindexgt include ltmutexgt  namespace tools     template lttypename Message, typename Contentgt   class FSM     public       class React      public       virtual stdtypeindex operator const Message amp msg, stdsharedptrltContentgt           return stdtypeindextypeidthis                   typedef stdvectorltstdsharedptrltReactgtgt Flux       FSM Flux amp flux, stdsharedptrltContentgt ctnt       current stdtypeindex typeid  flux.at0         , content ctnt             for  auto rct flux           states[ stdtypeindex typeid rct   ]  State rct, content                   void operator const Message amp msg         stdlockguardltstdmutexgt lock fsmmutex        current  states.at current  msg           private       class State       public       State stdsharedptrltReactgt rct, stdsharedptrltContentgt ctnt         content ctnt , react rct          State  content nullptr , react nullptr          stdtypeindex operator const Message amp message           return react message, content              private       stdsharedptrltContentgt content       stdsharedptrltReactgt react            stdmutex fsmmutex      stdsharedptrltContentgt content     stdtypeindex current     stdmapltstdtypeindex, Stategt states     codepre  pThe implementation class headerp  precodepragma once  include TurnstileTypes.h  namespace tools    namespace test      namespace fsm          Implementation of the Turnstile FSM example from httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFinitestatemachineExampleaturnstile        Added RESET event to better test state.       class Turnstile        public          Turnstilevoid          void operator const TurnstileEvent amp msg           unsigned long Pushed         unsigned long Paid         stdstring Now        private          TurnstileFSMFlux flux         stduniqueptrltTurnstileFSMgt fsm         stdsharedptrltTurnstileDatagt stats                  codepre  pThe implementation class bodyp  precodeinclude TurnstileTypes.h include TurnstileLocked.h include TurnstileUnlocked.h include Turnstile.h  namespace tools    namespace test      namespace fsm         TurnstileTurnstilevoid        stats stdmakesharedltTurnstileDatagt                 flux.pushback stdmakesharedltLockedgt          flux.pushback stdmakesharedltUnlockedgt          fsm  stduniqueptrltTurnstileFSMgt new TurnstileFSM flux, stats                 void Turnstileoperator const TurnstileEvent amp msg           fsm msg                 unsigned long TurnstilePushed  return statsgtpushes        unsigned long TurnstilePaid    return statsgtcoins         stdstring TurnstileNow       return statsgtstatename            codepre  pThank you very much for the answersp  p[update 131120] It may be helpful to mention, that codeFSM.hcode is not meant to be a library with a public interface. More so it is a boilerplate code to get an FSM author going. The actual user FSM interface is defined by that FSM implementation  in the attached example it is in codeTurnstile.hcode. As such, the FSM.h template kept be very short, and intended to be read and understood by an FSM author.p  pI would also expect them myself for now to understand the documented pitfalls of the template  like the fact that sending a message to any FSM while it is in a codeStatecodemethod will deadlock. Which can be caused by a chain of calls. a hrefhttpsplus.google.comVladDidenkoposts4Aijg6v1wvg relnofollowThanks to Florian Philipp comment on Googlea for pointing that out.p  pThere is also an intent to have least knowledge in FSM about codeMessagecode and codeContentcode types, so that FSM authors have most flexibility while implementing  that includes getting information out of content by something like accessors. That flexibility comes with responsibility of not changing the content.p

Negative 5746 pI am currently setting up asp.net mvc site, wcf services etc in IIS 7.5. I am currently configuring the application for app pools and have a question around app pool recycles. Each of the application rely on each other. At present there are no memory issues with any of the applications but at times we do have CPU issues with one of the applications.p  pThe applications support multiple timezones, from Europe to Australia, so as such there are no times where the applications have a period of downtime.p  pSo on the topic of recyles, I am not sure what to set up here. Should I attempt to include some time based recycling or look at a possible other approach I am not sure its correct to have no recycling of the app pools.p

Negative 5746 pIm using the VS2013 ASP.NET SPA template as a starting point for my web application which uses the new ASP.NET identity framework. This is from the templatep  precodepublic partial class Startup        static Startup            UserManagerFactory   gt new UserManagerltIdentityUsergtnew UserStoreltIdentityUsergt ....  codepre  pSo, since no DbContext is being passed into the UserStore constructor above, that indicates to me that a new DbContext is being created. Since I also wanted to make use of the data context for other data operations during the request, I changed the template code slightlyp  precodepublic partial class Startup   public static DerivedDbContextnull      static Startup         context  new DerivedDbContext            UserManagerFactory   gt new UserManagerltIdentityUsergtnew UserStoreltIdentityUsergtcontext ...  codepre  pNow, I can use the same DbContext from any of my controllers by accessingp  precodeStartup.context codepre  pBut, I got into trouble when multiple requests would come in at the same time because unrelated operations were happening in the same DbContext. From here, it was pointed out to me that I should NOT be instantiating a single DbContext for the entire lifecycle of the application, but rather just for the lifecycle of a particular request, so I moved the instantiation to the controllers constructor, but now, Ive got my own DbContext in the controller, and the UserManager still has its own and is created in the Startup class.p  pstrongWhy does the template have the UserManager instantiated once for all users in the Startup class Is it of concern that, by creating my own DbContext in a controller constructor, there are two DbContexts the one I create in the controllers constructor, and the one in the UserManager, created in the Startup class in play simultaneously Is it acceptable to have one single UserManager shared across all requests, and yet unacceptable to share one DbContext across all requests in generalstrongp  pHaving two separate contexts in play seems foolish and Im noticing that I sometimes get an outofsync view of data. Id like to understand if anyone else faced this problem with this template.p  pEdit I understand that an IOC framework like nInject might help manage object lifecycles in this scenario, but Id like to first gain an understanding of how to accomplish this without the help of such a framework.p  pThanks...

Negative 5746 pIm looking for some help in understanding how to connect an outbound socket to a destination IP on the 127.x.x.x loopback subnet while bound to a real IP assigned to the local machine. p  pI cannot bind a socket to have local endpoint 10.0.0.1 the workstations only nonloopback  IPv4 address and connect to remote server which is listening OK at address 127.4.5.6.  I see winsock error 10049 WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL and the .net framework pukes with The requested address is not valid in its context 127.4.5.650000p  pDetails.p  pI have a local socket that connects to a remote server.  I have to bind the source address of my socket to a specific local address.  This is because the machine that runs the socket might have many address available to it, but only one source IP address is NATd correctly so that the remote server trusts it.  I cannot bind the local socket to any old local address because the OS might choose one that is not NATd and so the remote server doesnt like the source address.p  pFunctionally this all works fine.p  pI am trying to unit test it.  Since mocking and subclassing sockets is not possible, my unit test spawns a local EXE that acts as the remote server, listening on a particular loopback address defined in command line parameters such as 127.4.5.6.  I can then connect my main program to that remote address 127.4.5.6 while the source is bound to 127.1.2.3.   This all works fine. p  pBut I want to make a change to allow the fake server the EXE to still listen on 127.4.5.6 while forcing the outbound socket thats being unit tested to bind locally to 10.0.0.1 the workstations LAN IP rather than 127.1.2.3. Windows doesnt like it  it throws a Winsock 10049 error, saying that the address is not valid in its context. p  pHow can I connect to a remote endpoint of a loopback address while locally bound to a local endpoint of a regular LAN address pleasep  pThanksp

For examplep  precode On first run, declare variable var rise0  Do something with it when the page is open setIntervalrise,10  And then store the value somehow when I close the browser browser.onCloselocallyStorekeyname,rise codepre  pSo that when I refresh the page or come back to it another day, the old value will be plugged back in and it will continue running from where I left off...p  pThnxp

Negative 5746 pIve a recordmodel thats filled up with a lot of boolean flags, short strings, misc settings, etc, and I want to refactor them into an encapsulated class.p  pI would normally create an inner class for the parent to own, but whats the best practice in Railsp  ul liJust leaving everything in the record  a hrefhttpapidock.comrailsv2.3.8ActiveRecordAggregationsClassMethodscomposedof relnofollowcomposedofa Not very clean though.li liSerializing Becomes not easily searchable  overhead  extensibility issues. Still not clean.li liCreate another record, associate it, and a hrefhttpapidock.comrailsv2.3.8Moduledelegate relnofollowdelegatea But have to delegate and manage assignment, aliases boolean fields, createsave callbacks, more stuff Im unaware of...li liIs there a way to create in inner recordli liAnother wayli ul  pAn example would be having a table codeClientcode, with a low number of rows 1020. Each codeClientcode is has long list of options, currently stored under codeClientcode columns. So there are fields such asp  precodec  Client.find1 c.themecolor  blue c.sessiontimeoutseconds  1800 c.brandinglogo  clienta.png c.requirelogoutconfirmation  true codepre  pIn a pure OOP system without rails, I would refactor these instance variables into a nested codeClientOptionscode class. Then all the options become organized inside a single nested class and are encapsulated inside codeClientcode. This way, nobody else needs to know that codeClientOptionscode and codeClientcode are closely related they would still just message codec.themecolorcode without knowing that codeClientcode will delegate the call to codeClientOptionscode within, and this would also become a looselycoupled refactoring since no other classes or method calls need to change.p  pHowever, the nested class thing isnt possible as far as I know in rails, so Im looking for a best practices solution.p

Negative 5746 pIm trying to create an event by clicking a button which will submit three pieces of information that I provide. My PHP script is supposed to return a JSON encoded response of the success or failure of this event creation. An example of such a response isp  precode       resulttrue,     messageYour event has been created    codepre  pTo return such a response, I have my PHP script doing the followingp  precode  answer  array  result gt true, message gt Your event has been created   return jsonencodeanswer codepre  pWhen I click on the button to create the event on the web page, the developers console in Chrome displays the following message Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property result of null. Ive played around with the way I return that response but nothing has worked so far. p  pFYI, additional ajax code kicks in to determine what to do next once the response is received but based on the error, it seems that there is something wrong with the way I am returning the response. p  pEdit Ajax code that will handle the returned responsep  precode   if that response is good   ifresponse.result          eventcreate.dialogclose         calendar.fullCalendarrefetchEvents    otherwise error    else    errormessage.htmlresponse.message.dialogopen codepre  pstrongEDIT 2strong Echoing it out seemed to resolve the issue and there are no errors being thrown at the user.

Negative 5746 pI am working on an application that installs some fonts in user windows font directory. but the problem is when the software tries to install the font, windows deny its access and my software show an error like access to the path cwindowsfontssegoeuisl.ttf is denied to user.p  pI try many way in stackoverflow and other websites but still my problem is exist and I dont understand why its not working.p  pso Im here to ask you how can I solve this problem.p  pIm waiting for any suggestion.p  pEdit 1p  pI also use File.Copy method to install fonts.p  pEdit 2p  pI Dont want to ask user to run my software as admin, because after that, user cant drag amp drop any file.p  pI want to access directly from my software. Now I want to ask you HOW CAN I ACCESS TO DENIED DIRECTORY WITH MY OWN SOFTWARE WITHOUT USING ADMIN RIGHT Thanksp
Negative 5746 pI have found a solution that partially fits my needs. When pressing a button I need a div to rotate 90 degrees, on next press 90 degrees more etc. And i need another button which would rotate it in the opposite direction the same way. I found a JavaScript Fiddle and slightly modified it, but the problem is that on the button press the div would revert to its original position before each rotate. So its not possible to rotate it more than 90 degrees. How do I fix this The second question is why would it rotate only once, if I change broderSpacing from 90 to 90 button works only once then nothing happens on clickp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netskunkstsHwTMb1130 relnofollowJSFIddleap  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idfoogtTextltdivgt ltbutton onclickrotateFoogtrotateltbuttongt codepre  pCSSp  precodefoo      width100px     height100px     positionabsolute     top100px     left100px      borderspacing 0     backgroundcolorred  codepre  pJSp  precodefunction rotateFoo     foo.animateborderSpacing 90,      step functionnow,fx             this.csswebkittransform,rotatenowdeg        this.cssmoztransform,rotatenowdeg       this.csstransform,rotatenowdeg     ,     durationslow     ,linear   codepre

Negative 5746 pI am attempting to raise an event in .NET and have it picked up through COM by a VBA application. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma45020263175562This answera has been quite helpful in getting my events to show up properly in the type library.p  pOn the VBA side, everything looks legit. I have an object variable declared WithEvents ,the IDE lets me add event handlers, and the compiler doesnt complain.  However at runtime, when I use New to create the object I get the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa26450028vvs.6029.aspx relnofollowRuntime error 459 This component doesnt support this set of events.a  According to the help file , this means You tried to use a WithEvents variable with a component that cant work as an event source for the specified set of events.p  pI do not really know why. I do not think I am running afoul of the Implements rule that the help file also explains.  Below is the IDL for the type library luckily it is a short one.  Can anyone see what is wrong with this type library that is causing this p  pEDIT  p  pRemembering that I had a COM version of this component from several versions ago, I compared its IDL and notice that on it, both interfaces are marked a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6kf87e9c.aspx relnofollownonextensiblea.  Is this relevant to the WithEvents failure  When I use that component instead of the new one, it does not fail at New and receives events properly.p  pThe only other differences I see are the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhk3bk11y.aspx relnofollowhiddena attribute and the double underscore naming for the event interface and why would either of those matterp  pstrong.tlb from

The algorithm is given a seed URI, based on which it creates a graph in memory, by expanding stepbystep, keeping track of already visited nodes and a frontier of unexplored territory. To create this expansion, I have created two SPARQL templates that I feed URIs from the frontier into. The two simplified expressions arep  precodeCONSTRUCT s p o WHERE      s p o .     FILTERs IN ltURI1gt, ltURI2gt,... ltURINgt .     FILTERS....  codepre  pandp  precodeCONSTRUCT s p o WHERE      s p o .     FILTERo IN ltURI1gt, ltURI2gt,... ltURINgt .

It should also be noted that I add in several filters, which have been left out for simplicities sake.p  pWhen I execute these queries, there is a rather large difference in execution time between statement one and two. Statement one is executed 36x faster than statement two, even though the statements are largely the same.p  pCould someone provide a hint as to why there is such a large discrepancy between the two queries And even better, how query two might be restructured in order to attain better performancep  pThank you for your time and patiencep

Negative 5746 pIm running a bunch of rspec tests in parallel using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comgrosserparalleltests relnofollowparalleltestsa framework. Before I parallelized the tests, I was outputting the results from the tests into an html file like sop  precoderspec format html out tmpindex.html ltpatterngt codepre  pNow it looks more like thisp  precodeparallelspec format html out tmpindex.html ltpatterngt codepre  pHowever, now that the tests are running in parallel, each test is generating its own html file, and since they all use the same path tmpindex.html, the last test to finish overwrites the output html file and Im left with a report of only that one test. How can I generate either a single html file which contains the aggregated results of all of my tests this would be ideal And if thats not possible, how can I output each test to its own output html file so they dont all overwrite each otherp  pI tried using the builtin loggers in the paralleltest project ParallelTestsRSpecRuntimeLogger, ParallelTestsRSpecSummaryLogger, and ParallelTestsRSpecFailuresLogger but those all just generate simple text files instead of the nice html files like rspec does. I also saw this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8623976cucumberparalleltestshtmlresultsherea but Im not using cucumber, so this doesnt really apply to me. I tried putting codeformat html out tmpreportlt ENV[TESTENVNUMBER] gt.htmlcode in my code.rspecparallelcode file, but that didnt have any effect.p
Negative 5746 pI have the simplest setupp  pAn empty asp.net MVC application with one controllerp  precodepublic class HomeController  Controller      public ActionResult Editint id              return View           public ActionResult Commitint id              return View       codepre  pMy Edit.cshtml has a call to ActionLink like sop  precodeHtml.ActionLinkCommit Data, Commit codepre  pIf I now access the EditAction through strongHomeEdit2strong I would expect that the rendered link directs the user to strongHomeCommit2strong.p  pIt does not  ... The link is created to HomeCommit, completely disregarding the current RouteData entries.p  pI am using the default routing configuration have not added any routes.p  pOne way to fix this would be to add an explicit route for both actionsp  precode        routes.MapRoute                 name null,                 url HomeEditid,                 defaults new  controller  Home, action  Edit                    routes.MapRoute                 name null,                 url HomeCommitid,                 defaults new  controller  Home, action  Commit                    routes.MapRoute                 name Default,                 url controlleractionid,                 defaults new  controller  Home, action  Index, id  UrlParameter.Optional           codepre  pThis works  but I really dont want to explicitly define every single route in the app  if I am using the default pattern...p  pThe second solution would be to just add the routingvalues manually like sop  precodeHtml.ActionLinkCommit Data, Commit, Home, new id  Model.Id codepre  pBut this also seems not right  ActionLink SHOULD use the current routing information, should it notp  pWhat am I missingp

Negative 5746 pI have an application with Google maps in it. Currently the maps are rendered in a WebBrowser via the Maps Javascript API.p  pI have a requirement to make the map interact with the application. Specifically, I have placed markers on the map.

If needed, I can tear the whole thing out and put a new map in there  but it emshouldem be Google because we have the expensive enterprise API and it absolutely emhas toem remain inside the winform.p  pHow can I accomplish this interactivityp

So my question is, is there a better more efficient way architecture to store retrieve my data setp  pOne thing to note, I know Guids are inherently slow to index search but I am pretty much constrained to using them due to the way Dynamics CRM works.  I guess I could create a Dictionary to lookup Guids and convert them to integer values, or something along those lines, but I am not convinced that would help muchp  pemEditemp  pOkay, I tested the three solutions using my live data 371,901 Guids and these are the results as an average time per 1,000 Guids.

I am going to accept the BinarySearch as the correct answer as it does what I wanted and is much faster than my original code.p  pJust to be clear here, the IntersectWith is indeed smoking fast, but it doesnt work for my particular problem as I need to constantly go back to my original hashset.p

Negative 5746 pIn CoffeeScript, I like to use destructuring assignments when returning functions with multiple return values. It makes it clearer what is being returned, versus returning an array.p  pFor instance, returning an array from a function in JavaScriptp  precodefunction getSumAndDifffirstNumber, secondNumber    var sum  firstNumber  secondNumber   var difference  firstNumber  secondNumber    return [sum, difference]   var values  getSumAndDiff10, 5 var sum  values[0] var difference  values[1] codepre  pWhile in CoffeeScript, returning an object from a functionp  precodegetSumAndDiff  firstNumber, secondNumber gt   sum  firstNumber  secondNumber   difference  firstNumber  secondNumber    sum, difference  sum, difference  getSumAndDiff10, 5 codepre  pHowever, the problem is that the CoffeeScript method replaces any existing variables called codesumcode and codedifferencecode. So if I ran this function multiple times in succession, then they would keep overwriting the previous one.p  pThere are several ways of resolving this, of course, such as simply by assigning the returned variables to other names each time, like sop  precodesum, difference  getSumAndDiff10, 5 sum1  sum difference1  difference  sum, difference  getSumAndDiff11, 6 sum2  sum difference2  difference codepre  pBut is there a cleaner way of doing it Or, is perhaps the best solution to simply return an array when I need to run a function like this multiple times in a row Or would closures make sense, or is that too much excessive code Im just wondering if theres something Im perhaps missing, because I figure theres got to be a cleaner way of doing this, especially with CoffeeScript Or maybe my general approach to this is flawed, such as I should instead only have one return value per function instead, to simplify thingsp

Negative 5746 pI recently discovered something that bugs me...p  pI use RANMAR algorithm to generate random number. It is said that it is the best algorithm currently available if you know a better one, please let me know.p  pI was really surprised to notice that the smallest double it can generate is roughly 1e8.p  pSo I tried with codestdrandcode with the common p  precodedoublerand  RANDMAX codepre  pway of generating double and I noticed that the smallest number is roughly 1e9. I kind of understand that in this case because code1.0RANDMAXcode is roughly code1.0231  1e9code on my computer, I know that codeRANDMAXcode can have different values.p  pI was therefore wondering if it was possible to generate random double between code[01]code with the smallest possible value beeing near machine precision.p  p[edit]p  pI just want to be more precise... when I said that the smallest number that was generated was of the order of code1e9code, I should also have said that the next one is code0code. Therefore there is a huge gap infinity number of numbers between code1e9code and 0 that will be considered as code0code. I mean by that if you do the following test p  precodedouble xis a value computed somehow in your code that is small 1e12 ifxgtrand will be true for all random number generated that are below 1e9 codepre  pSo the condition will be true for too many numbers...p  p[edit]p

What exactly decides when the method will be called For example, in android,  the activity class has an onCreate callback method that executes whenever an Activity is created, but what code controls this Is the doInBackground method of the AsyncTask class also a callback method that executes whenever a  foo.execute is called, where foo is an AsyncTask objectp

After the user is finished with Activity B, they can press the back button or finish Activity B. When Activity B closes, Activity A should be shown. Currently, I close Activity A which closes the entire app and receive a push notification. I select the push notification which opens Activity B. When I close Activity B, Activity A is not shown and the entire app closes. I want Activity A to be there after finishing Activity B. p  pI am using Parse SDK notifications. In my custom ParsePushBroadcastReceiver I have the following codep  precodepublic class MyReceiver extends ParsePushBroadcastReceiver     Override   public void onPushOpenContext context, Intent intent                  Intent i  new Intentcontext, NotificationActivity.class     i.putExtrasintent.getExtras     i.setFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK      context.startActivityi     codepre  pI have it listed in the Android Manifest.

Negative 5746 pSo me and my friend are currently working on an android game based on a surface view. It is a local network multiplayer so its played over BT or LAN. At the moment it is very laggy but we dont know why.  We have done some research and first started using Buffered Streams, than we replaced ObjectStreams with DataStreams and tried only to use longs as data, so that we only need primitive datatypes and no arrays merged numbers with Cantors Pairing function etc. Was this desicion rigth Is ObjectStream really slower than DataStream But is still pretty slow. We send a long in about 1ms to update position of players from client to server and parallel from server to client. This means we have a datatransfair of 64bitms  2  64kbits 2 128kbits. Is that to mouch Is there a smarter way to sync the position of the players which is stored in a double[] We also thougth of switching to ints or an other datatype to keep data small. We found out that TCP is the standart way of transfairing but since we send that much data it would be ok if we lose some packages, so we thought of switching to UDP to increase performance. Any advicestutorials on thisp  pWe also make usage of multiple Threats total 8 UIThread, a Thread to call draw, 2 Reader and 2 Writer Threads, and 2 Threads for the Characters, one for each, but start them with Thread.start. Should we do that in an other way I heared that this is not always the best way to handle Threads on multicore devices.p  pOr may there just be other reasons that make our game laggy Are we searching on the wrong end for issues It is our very first attempt on creating games using the Canvas and SurfaceViews and we try to figure out as much as possible on ower owns so we dont google that much and dont follow a specific tutorial, so maybe things arent handled conventional by us.p

Ideally, I wanted some template object where I can directly pass the function typedef, including both return type and parameter Types likep  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt class FunctionStore      public         FunctionStoreltTgt         virtual FunctionStoreltTgt          void addFunction const T ampnewFunction         void callAllFunctions const Parameter amp parameter  const     private         vectorltTgt functionStorage  codepre  pbut this didnt work out because I couldnt get the parameter list out from within the template to properly define the codecallAllFunctionscode function.p  pI then tried to ignore the option for properly typedeffing the whole tr1function and just split this into returnType and parameterType within the class itself, which kind of works, but only with a fixed number of parameterp  precodetemplatelttypename R  void, typename P1  voidgt class FunctionStore          typedef tr1functionltR P1 amp gt Function      public         FunctionStoreltR, P1gt         virtual FunctionStore          void addFunction const Function ampnewFunction                       functionStorage.pushbacknewFunction                   void callAllFunctions const P1 ampparameter  const                      for Function fn  functionStorage                              fnparameter                            private         vectorltFunctiongt functionStorage  codepre  pBut with this, I can not really make the P1 Type optional. I tried this with defaulting it to void, but because i use it as codeP1 amp parametercode, it would evaluate to expecting a codefnvoid ampcode, which is not the same as codefncode. Also, not using the codeampcode does not work because it creates an illegal void reference. I also thought about variadic parameters because it would kind of solve the optional requirement, but since the parameter number and types are obviously actually defined in the types and needed for the tr1bind placeholder stuff, this seems to be the wrong way to go.p  pSo how can I make this happen. I assume there is no real way to make the first option which I would obviously prefer happen, so a solution to the second is still much appreciated.p

Negative 5746 pWe have a .NET WebAPI that we want to allow domain users access to. We want to support building JavaScript single page applications to get and present data from the WebAPI.

Negative 5746 pThanks for any help and glad to update and edit this question as answers and comments come in. Code has been shortened for hopefully easier reading.p  pIm trying to implement MVVM in WPF using Entity Framework 6 database first. p  pI can currently retrieve data, perform CRUD and display individual columns as I want in a data grid.

Basically, ActiveWeight  SecurityWeight  BenchmarkWeight.p  pSo for example Id have a datagrid with the entities from the model and then either in the same datagrid, another datagrid or even any itemscontrol that would display the collection of calculated data and it would automatically update when I updated SecurityWeight or BenchmarkWeight in the datagrid.p  pIm able to initially retrieve and display the calculated data through two different processes.p  pThe first process is add a partial class to the entity modelp  precodepublic partial class Weight              public decimal ActiveWeight                      get  return SecurityWeight  BenchmarkWeight                codepre  pThen bind to this property in the view.p  pThe other process is p  p0.5 I Dont change the entity model. 1Create a method to retrieve data from the entity modelp  precodeObservableCollectionltdecimalgt Retrieve      ObservableCollectionltdecimalgt temp  new ObservableCollectionltdecimalgt     foreach var item in Weights              temp.Additem.SecurityWeight  item.BenchmarkWeight          return temp  codepre  p2 Call it in the constructor of the viewmodelp  precode public WeightsViewModel                      context  new BenchMarkEntities             context.Weights.Load             this.Weights  context.Weights.Local             ActWeight2  Retrieve          codepre  p3 assign to an additional property in the viewmodelp  precodepublic ObservableCollectionltdecimalgt ActWeight2                      get             set          codepre  pBut I can see the second process is flawed because if Retrieve is called you then add more items.p  pHere is the XAML   precodeUpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged               AutoGenerateColumnsFalsegt             ltDataGrid.Columnsgt                 ltDataGridTextColumn HeaderSecurityWeight BindingBinding SecurityWeightgt                 ltDataGridTextColumn HeaderBenchmarkWeight BindingBinding BenchmarkWeightgt                 ltDataGridTextColumn HeaderActiveWeight BindingBinding ActiveWeightgt             ltDataGrid.Columnsgt      ltDataGridgt         ltListBox ItemsSourceBinding ActWeight2gt codepre  pIssue when I make updates, the calculated data doesnt update on the display.p  pAny guidance on how to do this would be most appreciated.p  pRyep

Negative 5746 pI am doing a university project, we have to use the Unix system call. Right now, Im really struggling to understand if, in my project, there really is a mistake. This is because, while in terminal it compiles and it starts and finishes without error, on xcode I get several errors.p  pIn particular, I get errors when using semaphores.p  pIll try to explain what errors, I receive, but since Im not native English speakers forgive me in advance if I make some mistakes.p  pFirst, the program creates a number of child processes with a fork . It does depending on how many clientei.txt located i  iterator. Immediately I block parent with a semaphore, I run the child up to a certain point, then I block it with a semaphore and I restart the parent.p  pAt this point, the parent should read a message sent by his son, call a function to print the content inside a log.txt and restart the son.p  pThen the child does other things including erase the message and it block. The parent restart, and everything is repeated for subsequent children.p  pWhile in terminal synchronization is perfect everything happens at the right time without error this both Linux and Mac, about XCode I had several errorsp  psemop Resource temporarily unavailable if I created more than 5 txt semop File too large if I created more than 2p  pwith 2 instead gave me two errors semop 1 Interrupted system call this stops after running both processes semop 3 Identifier removed with this in restarting the second processp  pis not so much time that I do C then I do not know what to do. I would like first of all to know if I have to worry so there is an error, or I have to be quiet because it is a bug in xcode. If there was a mistake I kindly ask you not to ask me to change the code a lot. This is mainly because they are close to expiring and I can not afford to do it all again. I also ask you, if you can, to be as clear as possible. I understand enough English, but not as a mothertongue, I can not always follow the responses here on StackOverflow.p  pThe code is here a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms2utsb6r5d7kzzqjxcode2Bterminal.zipdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.coms2utsb6r5d7kzzqjxcode2Bterminal.zipdl0a this zip contain a small part of the project that has this problem. the terminal version works. there is a makefile in this version to simplify the compilation. xcode version does not work. It contains the Debug folder. Indeed xcode, txt files, it does not read from the root folder where the codes are contained in the folder where it creates the compiled. There is a readme in each case with the procedure in detail.p  pI tried to minimize, I commented all in English.

Theoretically, it shouldnt be a problem, as I use php, which works   serverside. However, its not so easy in practice. But theres a   solution, suggested in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma230356551801588its answera to make one of the cookies   with and the other without httponly property. I was afraid that having   the old value in the password cookie would collide with login as   another user, but I tested it and it works fine, the new users   password just overwrites the old users one.p blockquote

Negative 5746 pSo I am trying to centralize the data service that passes all of the information back and forth between my application and the backend services.p  pMy application does not autobootstrap using ngappmyApp, instead it loads the few modules it needs to load an external config file, and use that to get the initial data from the server before bootstrapping the application.  Once the application gets bootstrapped, the feeds are assigned to the main controllers scope via codescope[feedName]  feedDatacode.  Because the feeds may vary, Ive done this to ensure that the data is available to all scopes at all times.p  pSince I need to be able to use resource efficiently in this prebootstrapped scenario, I wrote a small function to get data called codegetDataFromurl, data, methodcode.p  pIt looks like this p  precodegetDataFrom  functionurl, data, method      Create the resource object to get the data using the supplied parameters         var getData  resourceurl, .extenddata, callback JSONCALLBACK, query method method       Return the promise immediately         return getData.query.promise  codepre  pIt works perfectly in this scenario.

Negative 5746 pStrings in a codeQObjectcodes translated at runtime. AFAIU, if the translator is changed, all strings are refreshed. However, strings declared at module level or even static class attributes, are translated at import time.p  pI can see 3 ways of allowing module strings to be translated, none of which seems totally satisfying to me p  ul lipImport the module after the translator is installed see a hrefhttpsplashless.wordpress.com20140201internationalizingpythonpyqtapps relnofollowherea paragraph emInstall translator earlyem. This may not be handy but is feasible, as long as one doesnt need to change language at runtime. pli lipMake the strings class instance attributes. Well... yes, obviously. But this breaks the design.pli lipKeep the strings at module level. Use codeQtCore.QCoreApplication.translatecode to let them be picked up by pylupdate. Then translate them again at runtime by calling codeself.trcode or codeQtCore.QCoreApplication.translatecode on them. Example p  precodetranslate  QtCore.QCoreApplication.translate strings  [translatefoo, translatebar]  class myclassQObject      def initself         for s in strings             printself.trs codepre  pWhen doing this, one must ensure that no translator will be installed before module import, otherwise, the module strings are translated at import time translate in declaration and retranslated at run time self.tr in class instance. In the general case this wont be seen self.tr will try to translate an already translated string which is not likely to exist in the original language string set, and it will silently return the string itself. p  pBut if for instance an English string happens to translates into a French string that is equal to another English string appearing in the same class, then the French translation of this string will be displayed instead.pli ul  pIs there a clean way of doing this p

Negative 5746 pI really like the frontend philosophy and structure of lineman.js. Id like to use it on a project and while I know that one of the points is to decouple the frontend from the backend, I want to know which framework would also allow me to rapidly create a RESTful JSON API which would very simply integrate into a combined deployment process with the lineman.js Angular.js frontendp  pId like one grunt script to build both the front end and back end, but Id like to maintain the flexibility to separate them if necessary.p  pHeres why Im asking this question At the moment the main alternative to this strategy for me would be MEAN.js and its yo generator, but I feel like Ill be missing out on the organization and simplicity of lineman.js Plus, MEAN.js may be overkill if I could just use StrongloopLoopback to accomplish my APIbackend goals more simplyp

Negative 5746 pIm working on a rails project that is connected to a thirdparty MySQL database strongthat I cannot change the schema forstrong.  So far, Ive been able to shoehorn everything into rails and make it play nice, but Ive come across an interesting problem.p  pI have a table, well call it codefooscode.  I have an ActiveRecord model called codeFoocode that uses this table.  The problem is that this table represents two similar but distinct types of record.  Well call them Foo type A and Foo type B.  To get around this, Ive created two classes, codeFooTypeAcode and codeFooTypeBcode that inherit from codeFoocode and have default scopes so that they only contain records of their respective types.p  pMy code looks something like thisp  precodeclass Foo lt ActiveRecordBase    methods common to both types end  class FooTypeA lt Foo   defaultscope gt  where istypea true     methods for type A end  class FooTypeB lt Foo   defaultscope gt  where istypea false     methods for type B end codepre  pFor the most part, this works pretty well, except for the fact that sometimes an association chain joins over both of these models.  Since they come from the same table, this causes ambiguity problems, and generates exploding SQL queries.  Ive been writing custom join queries to get around this, but its quickly becoming cumbersome.p  pI know I can change the default table name for a model with the codeself.tablenamecode value, but is there a way that I can tell rails to change the FROM portion of the SQL query for a model so that I can make all queries from FooTypeA read as codeSELECT fooas. FROM foos AS fooas ...codep  pIm open to other suggestions, but this seems like the easiest solution if its possible.p

Negative 5746 pIm using a Vagrant VM created by Puphpet, running Ubuntu 14.04 for the purpose of developing a Wordpress site. I use Composer to manage PHP dependencies, and Composer is installed automatically as a system service via Puphpet, so there is no .phar file, just an executable Composer file in codeusrlocalbincomposercode. p  pI also use PHPStorm as my main IDE, and love its Remote Interpreter feature. So far, PHPUnit is the only feature that supports it, as Composer and PHP Codesniffer requires having a local PHP interpreter installed in order to be used. This kind of defeats the purpose of the ComposerPHP Codesniffer tools within PHPStorm when used with Vagrant. Jetbrains claims they have no plans to add this feature in the near future.p  pWhich leads me to my question Would it be possible to set up a shared folder to the PHP executable file in my VM, and use that as my Remote Interpreter in the Composer Settings window p  pCould I also do the same to my PHPCS executable file path in the Code Sniffer settings panel with PHPStorm p  pThe only one I wouldnt be able to set up a Shared Folder to is the composer.phar file which is needed to run the Composer tool within PHPStorm, because there is no composer.phar file within my VM, as its just an executable in codeusrlocalbincomposercode as I described earlier. So would the solution be to download a composer.phar file to somewhere within my host directory Will this interfere the Composer install on the VMp  pUpdate As Sven has explained to me, the Composer file in usrlocalbincomposer is the composer.phar file. I kind of understood this, but still am not sure if a. PHPStorm will recognize it as such, and b. if creating a shared folder will even work.p  pI added images of the settings panels so you can understand what Im talking about.p  pThanks, let me know if you need anymore info. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtBTc2.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKcnHK.png altenter image description herep
Negative 5746 pIn my current solution I have a Post table and a vote table that has a foreign key to the post it was cast on, along with a user id.p  pWhat I was wondering if I should keep a column with the total vote count for the post. So when a user cast a vote, an entry is inserted into the table while the votes column is incremented either upvote or downvote.p  pCurrently, I have a UserDefined Function that gets the vote for a specific post, which is utilized on other UDF to calculate scores for sorting.p  pThinking I might save on processing power and improve on speed, if I didnt have to query for every row the vote count from another table on each query. So Im looking for some feedback.p

Negative 5746 pCurrently the program is able to render a 2dimensional graph as well as triangle. However I wish to render a 3D plane mesh for the purposes of creating a Bezier Surface. Just now there is a problem in that I have created the three transformation matrices required to translate the mesh down the y axis whilst repositioning the camera above the surface of the plane and aiming it into the distance although pointing slightly down the yaxis so you should be able to see the plane mesh at the bottom of the screen trailing off into the distance using the glm math library extension functionsp  precodeglmmat4 worldTransform, view, projection                                                                     Declare the model view and projection matrices worldTransform  glmtranslateglmmat41.0f, glmvec30.0, 5.0, 0.0                                    Make the terrain mesh appear 5 units below the camera on the yaxis  worldTransform is currently just a translation matrix  in future could incorporate rotation and scaling     view  glmlookAtglmvec30.0, 3.0, 0.0, glmvec30.0, 2.0, 5.0, glmvec30.0, 1.0, 0.0             Position of camera, point of focus, up direction vector projection  glmperspective45.0f, 1.0fsWidth  sHeight, 0.1f, 1000.0f codepre  pI then store the matrices in three uniforms like sop  precodeNB mWorldTransform, mView and mProjection declared as GLuint globally glUniformMatrix4fvmWorldTransform, 1, GLFALSE, glmvalueptrworldTransform                                glUniformMatrix4fvmView, 1, GLFALSE, glmvalueptrview glUniformMatrix4fvmProjection, 1, GLFALSE, glmvalueptrprojection codepre  pwhich correspond to the three matrix uniforms in the vertex shaderp  precodeversion 440 core layoutlocation  0 in vec3 inposition  Vectors vec4 actualPos  Matrices uniform mat4 worldTransform, view, projection                  Matrix multiplication to occur in the vertex shader in reverse order  void mainvoid  actualPos  vec4inposition, 1.0 glPosition  projectionviewworldTransformactualPos  codepre  pThe program compiles but unfortunately doesnt seem to apply the transformations to the vertices of the plane mesh and the screen is blank. If I dont call the function that prepares the uniforms above and comment out the transformations in the vertex shader the plane renders however because the camera is level with the plane it simply shows the plane as a line traversing the width of the screen. My question is Am I doing something wrong in setting up the uniforms And why is the screen not rendering the plane when I apply the transformations if in fact they are being applied p

Negative 5746 pSo I am learning Sails.js at the moment and more specifically the integrated socket functionality of the framework. I do like the framework because it is very good for building APIs.  My question is can you give me some comparison between socket.io and the sails sockets. I mean good and bad sides and is it worth it to learn the sails sockets or I should just use socket.io Can I use socket.io in sails is another question. I didnt find any tutorials for Sails.js sockets and I am very confused. Also Im new to sockets so if you can explain like for a beginner.p
Negative 5746 pI worked with 4DOS a lot decades ago, and bash more recently, but dont have experience with plain Windows batch. Im trying to make something to conveniently kill the firefox.exe processes that sometimes misfire and never show Firefox but persist and eat my resources.p  pTrying to make a querytouser that defaults to kill the processes. The first problem is the if REPLySOMETHING goto SOMEWHERE statements. The explicit ones work fine but I want to kill the firefoxes if none of them are true. I thought Id just put the code after the if...gotos but that didnt work. So I tried an additional if based on the variable REPLy equaling nothing. That didnt work. So I thought maybe a variable equaling nothing  might not be the same as being undeclared and maybe the reply stuff was simply removing the variable rather than giving the value  and added an if for that. That didnt work either. So I thought maybe I had to put the kill code under a label and send execution there with a goto like the I did in the statements that work, but that doesnt work either. If I enter SOMETHING other than the explicit variations of NO or no, full or truncated, it works, kinda. The taskkill command reports success but it still fails in reality. But Ill work on that bridge when I get there. The immediate problem is how to get NO entry in other words, just hit the enter key to goto the kill code just like a nonno string does. What am I doing wrong herep  precodeecho off  REM All this stuff with the path is because I cant reboot this system right now long story and I can not seem to make the amended path stick. So for now, I set it each time. I presume I just need to reboot to make the path setting I changed under computer properties, etc, stick. echo This is the path path  PATHPATHCProgram FilesGnuWin32bin echo This is the path now path echo All these path setting and testing commands and remarks can be cleaned up after I figure out if the new path becomes permanent after reboot. REM Here ends the stuff I expect to delete after I can reboot.  REM Here begins the part I do not expect to change and that works fine.  tasklist  findstr B firefox.exe  wc l gt killfirefox.batvar.tmp  set p NUMBEROFPROCESSEsltkillfirefox.batvar.tmp del killfirefox.batvar.tmp  IF NOT DEFINED NUMBEROFPROCESSEs goto ERROR  NUMBEROFPROCESSEs not set  if NUMBEROFPROCESSEs0 goto NOPROCESSES  REM Since the contrary conditions lead to gotos, if processing gets to here, there are 1 or more firefox.exe processes.  echo The number of firefox.exe processes running is echo . echo      NUMBEROFPROCESSEs echo .  tasklist  findstr B firefox.exe  set p REPLy Kill these Yn  echo REPLy is REPLy pause  if REPLyn goto USER DECLINED TO KILL if REPLyN goto USER DECLINED TO KILL if REPLyno goto USER DECLINED TO KILL if REPLyNO goto USER DECLINED TO KILL  REM Here is where the problems start. By my reasoning, I shouldnt need any ifthen here, nor even a goto, just the code that is now in the part labeled KILL. The ifs and the goto and putting the code in the labeled section are the result of many attempts to get that code to run with various constructions.  if [REPLy]  [] goto KILL IF NOT DEFINED REPLy goto KILL goto KILL  NOPROCESSES echo There are no firefox.exe processes running. pause exit ERROR  NUMBEROFPROCESSEs not set echo Logic error  The variable is not defined. This script must be repaired. pause exit USER DECLINED TO KILL echo User declined to kill processes. pause exit  KILL REM I am not sure if ANY of this is running because the pause command is not working and the terminal disappears to fast to see. What am I doing wrong here echo killing . . . taskkill IM firefox.exe pause exit codepre  pAdded by edit OK, I musta confused my smart pills with my dumb pills. Here is how I fixed the part that I was stuck onp  pI changed     set p REPLy Kill these Yn to    set p REPLy Kill these Yn  set REPLyY and that did the trick. I see why that works, but I dont quite see why the ways I tried before dont. Apparently Batch treats variables set unset cleared nulled by set p somemessage with just a plain enter key as a response in some way I dont understand. But anyway, I dont have to understand it, just accept it. The construction with the  above works. Anyway this was the part of the problem I asked about and its solved. If I cant get the rest of it working Ill post again after cleaning this batch file up a bit.p

Negative 5746 pI am building a simple quiz program, using PHP and MYSQL.p  pThe quiz is designed to display one question at a time the questions are multiplechoice each question has 4 possible answersp  pIf the player picks the correct one, he proceeds to the next question if he picks the wrong one, the quiz comes to an end.p  pAt first, I designed the quiz as follows p  p1 created a database table, which contains 1500 questions.  The table has the following columns   p  precodeID primary key QUESTION the question itself A1 first answer A2 second answer A3 third answer A4 fourth answer CORRECT  the correct answer  which is one of the above A1 to A4 codepre  p2  Then, my PHP code was designed to pick questions, one by one, in SEQUENTIAL order  using the ID as reference.p  pSo, when the user starts playing, he begins with Question 1, then Question 2, etc, etc.p  p3  To make it more interesting, I added an extra column to the database beginid, which has a default value of 1, when a user registers as a player on my quizwebsite. Each time the user answers a question, this column is updated with that questions ID. Meaning, it records the LAST question the user answered whether wrongly or correctly.  So that  the next time the user logs on, and plays the quiz, he does not begin from Question1.  Instead, he begins from the NEXT question in the list.

Negative 5746 pI am attempting to eliminate the issue of Security Roles being dropped when changing a Users Business Unit in CRM 2011.  I have taken a few approaches with varying degrees of success, but none provide a seamless solution. So far a combination of plugins seems to be the best way.   p  pThe challenge is this The Security Roles are dropped after the prevalidation stage, but before the preoperation stage.  I am able to capture the users security roles in the original Business Unit when I register my plugin on the prevalidation stage if I execute an update other than changing the Business Unit, but the prevalidation plugin does not get triggered when running a Change Business Unit Update the first stage that occurs is preoperation.  I need to execute the prevalidation plugin when updating the users Business Unit.  Once I get the name of the security role, I can store it in the PluginExecutionContext shared variables, then in my poststage event plugin, I can query for the new security role with the correct name that is associated with my new Business Unit that part of the code is working.  p  pHas anyone either figured out how to p  pa transfer a users security roles from the original BU to a new one using plugins or notp  pOR p  pb trigger a plugin registered on the prevalidation stage for a Change Users Business Unit actionp

So can you suggest a clean way to overcome this issue p

Negative 5746 pIm working on a webapp that is not AJAXbased. I have implemented a drag and drop functionality for file uploads but, as expected, the transfer gets cancelled if the user clicks on any link.

Negative 5746 pI have an FXML file that has buttons with onMouseClicked attributes. I do not set a Controller up in the FXML because I have constructor injected data I want to provide to the Controller.p  precode  ltButton mnemonicParsingfalse onMouseClickednewWidgetRequestButtonClicked textNew Widget... gt codepre  pIm setting the Controller programatically, and my controller contains the methods specified in the FXML. The Controller functions execute, and everything works fine.p  precodeFXMLLoader loader  new FXMLLoadergetClass.getResourceMainView.fxml MyController controller  new MyController... loader.setControllercontroller codepre  pMy problem lies in IntelliJs inspection of the .fxml files. On each occurrence of the function reference, it reports Error45, 54 No controller specified for top level element. I am looking at IntelliJs inspection rules and do not see this rule in the JavaFX section. Again, the program builds and runs just fine, so it is not a real compilation error. I want to disable this error notification.p  pHow can I avoid this errorp
