Positive 1301 pThe selfsigned certificate feature in IIS on Windows 7 Ultimate only creates SHA1 certificates. I have tried creating my own certificate using makecert. However, there is a problem. makecert only creates a certificate usable for localhost, whereas the selfsigned feature will create a certificate for my machine name. So for example, on my local box I hit a hrefhttpsMyMachinedefault.aspx relnofollowhttpsMyMachinedefault.aspxa, NOT a hrefhttpslocalhostdefault.aspx relnofollowhttpslocalhostdefault.aspxa.

Having all requests routed to the base application is no problem, but when I add a condition it seems like all routing stops working. I have successfully used rewriting previously for simpler tasks, but never with a structure like this. I am not sure if the best approach is to have the root application running as vas in IIS and then create nested sub applications below or if its better to have a simple virtual directory with a completely different name and just use some sort of rewrite  rerouting. p  pI was hoping to get this working on the local IIS instead of asking the network administrators to handle it in the load balancer. p

Positive 1301 pSo, Ive been trying to bind Wowza media server to port 80 on our failover production server, and Im encountering something else being bound to the port.p  pThe process reports as System with PID 4. After chasing myself around the web for a while, I found numerous indicators that it could be IIS, MSSQL, Microsofts Web Deployment Service, or even the Branch Cache service. After exploring all of these options, as well as a couple more that relate specifically to this server, I can say that none of these are actually binding to that IP  not intentionally anyway.p  pIf I stop my IIS Server through the IIS manager, the port frees up  generally indicating to me that it is likely IIS. After rifling through my bindings somewhere around 68 times now, I can say beyond the shadow of a doubt, that none of the sites that I have defined are bound to this IP address. It also counts to mention that there is no longer a Default Site  before that runs through anyones head.p  pFurther, Ive run netsh http show servicestate and combed through the list for any entries matching the problem IP, and have found none.p  pIve also changed the SystemCurrentControlSetHttpListenOnlyList registry entry, to no avail.p  pDoes anyone have any other suggestions for locating whatever system process  related to or reliant on IIS  could have me spinningp

Negative 1301 pI am writing a software synthesizer and need to generate bandlimited, alias free waveforms in real time at 44.1 kHz samplerate. Sawtooth waveform would do for now, since I can generate a pulse wave by mixing two sawtooths together, one inverted and phase shifted.p  pSo far Ive tried the following approachesp  ol lipPrecomputing onecycle perfectly bandlimited waveform samples at different bandlimit frequencies at startup, then playing back the two closest ones mixed together. Works okay I guess, but does not feel very elegant. A lot of samples are needed or the gaps between them will be heard. Interpolating and mixing is also quite CPU intensive.pli lipIntegrating a train of DC compensated sinc pulses to get a sawtooth wave. Sounds great except that the wave drifts away from zero if you dont get the DC compensation exactly right which I found to be really tricky. The DC problem can be reduced by adding a bit of leakage to the integrator, but then you lose the low frequencies.pli ol  pSo, my question is What is the usual way this is done Any suggested solution must be efficient in terms of CPU, since it must be done in real time, for many voices at once.p

Negative 1301 pSuppose I have a class with 3 constructors, a default no argument constructor, a parameterized constructor, and a static constructor.   like this p  precodepublic MyClass   ...  public MyClassstring arg  this   ...   static MyClass   ...  codepre  pSupposing I invoke the parameterized constructor, in what order do these constructors execute  p  pI thought it was static, then parameterized, then default.  But ... my experience isnt agreeing with that.p  phr p  pThe background  I have an app that embeds a referenced DLL as a resource.  At runtime, the application registers an emassembly resolverem via p  precodestatic MyClass      AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve  new ResolveEventHandlerResolver  codepre  pwhere the Resolver method is defined like this p  precodestatic System.Reflection.Assembly Resolverobject sender, ResolveEventArgs args      ....  codepre  pI understood that the Resolver can produce an assembly any way it darn well chooses.  In my apps case, it does a p  precodeAssembly.GetExecutingAssembly.GetManifestResourceStreamname codepre  pwhere strongnamestrong is the name of the embedded resource.  Then read all the bytes of this resource, and do an Assembly.Loadbyte[] on the block of bytes that is read. p  pThis may sound strange to you, at first, but it works.   p  blockquote   pYou might say, emwhy in the world would you embed an assembly, rather than just ILMergeem  Good question.  I think I need to embed because the embedded assembly is signed, and I dont have the key to resign the merged assembly.  So I embed. p blockquote  pThe problem is this suppose I declare a private instance member variable on the class, which is of a type that is defined in the embedded assembly.  In my case, its an enum, and I also initialize the value of that enum.  p  pNow, if the static constructor has already run, then the initializer on that private member will have no problem running.  But what I see is a file not found error  your basic Fusion error. p  precodeUnhandled Exception System.IO.FileNotFoundException Could not load file or assembly MyApp, Version1.1.4.1, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenedbe51ad942a3f5c or one of its dependencies.

To enable assembly bind failure logging, set the registry value[HKLMSoftwareMicrosoftFusionEnableLog] DWORD to 1. Note There is some performance penalty associated with assembly bind failure logging. To turn this feature off, remove the registry value [HKLMSoftwareMicrosoftFusionEnableLog]. codepre  pIf I remove the private instance variable, then I dont get the Fusion error. p  pI can use variables of that type, or any other type defined in the embedded assembly, emlaterem, as long as they are not initialized on as member instance variables in the class.  I can use the types in a instance method, no problem. p  phr p  pWriting this up, I am thinking I may have come up with the answer to my own question.  Maybe it is a JIT timing issue maybe the instance constructors are being JITd before the static constructor is run.  This would, maybe  lead to the Fusion errorp  panyone have any insight  p  pIts not a huge crucial problem, because I can redesign the class to avoid the issue, removing all instance variables that depend on the embedded assembly.  But Id like to understand it.   p

Negative 1301 pIm tryingvery hard to make a small HTTP Proxy server which I can use to save all communications to a file.

I couldnt get it working, so I added lots more code to make it work threads etc, and now it sort of works. Basically, it recieves something from a client I just configured Mozilla Firefox to route its connections through this proxy and then routes it to google.com. After it sends Firefoxs data to google, recieves a responce, and sends that to Firefox. This works fine, but then the proxy fails to recieve any data from Firefox.

Either because the user entered some data or the id changes due to JPA merge being called inside the OSIV Open Session in View filter. p  pMy understanding of the equals and hashCode contract is that those should not change during the lifetime of an object.p  pWhat i have tried so far p  ul liequals based on hashCode which uses the database id or super.hashCode if id is null. Problem new addresses  start with an null id but get an id when attached to a person and this person gets merged reattached in the osivfilter.  li lilazy compute the hashcode when hashCode is first called and make that hashcode Transitional. Does not work, as merge returns a new object and the hashcode does not get copied over.li ul  pWhat i would need is an ID that gets assigned during object creation I think. What would be my options here I dont want to introduce some additional persistent property. Is there a way to explicitly tell JPA to assign an ID to an object p  pRegardsp

Negative 1301 pIve been compiling simple Hello World applications in Visual Studio 2010 with the C compiler Win32 is the target to see what the product looks like under the microscope when I run it with the Immunity debugger.  What Ive noticed, however, is that there is some code quite a bit of code, actually that gets run before my main function is reached.  A lot of this stuff looks security related or maybe prepping the system to manage processes or what not, but theres just a TON of it there.  Morever, the EntryPoint part of the PE file header seems to point into the interior of my .text segment, while it appears that my main function is resting at the very beginning of the .text segment.  My question is this  is there some good documentation regarding this prelude that is getting slapped onto the front of my code ANDOR is the main function typically placed at the very beginning of the .text segment by the VC compiler  Thanks for any insight you havep

Negative 1301 pA UserControl has 3 Dependency Properties FormatAvailabilities, Orientation and FullText. FormatAvailabilities is bound to the ItemsSource property of an ItemsControl. Orientation is bound to the Orientation property if the StackPanel which is in the ItemsPanelTemplate within the ItemsControl. FullText is bound to the Visibility property of two TextBlocks inside the DataTemplate of the ItemsControl. I am using two converters to determine which TextBlock to show a BoolToVisibilityConverter and a BoolToInvertedVisibilityConverter the latter is an inversion of the former. I copied the Visibility property asis from the TextBlock both of them, independently to the ItemsControl and it works correctly..p  pIt seems that the bindings on the TextBlocks are not working properly because both are always visible. Since they are both binding on the same property but one is inverted, there should never be a possibility for both to be visible at the same time.p  pI put a breakpoint in my converter and it is never hit, so my guess is that there is an issue with binding from within a repeating control to the outer control in which it is housed.p  pApp.xamlp  precodeltcommonBaseApp xClassxyz.App xmlnsconvertersclrnamespacexyz.Convertersassemblyxyzgt     ltcommonBaseApp.RootVisualgt         ltphonePhoneApplicationFrame xNameRootFrame SourceHome.xamlgt     ltcommonBaseApp.RootVisualgt      ltcommonBaseApp.Resourcesgt         ltconvertersBoolToVisibilityConverter xKeyBoolToVisibilityConvertergt         ltconvertersBoolToVisibilityConverter xKeyBoolToInvertedVisibilityConverter IfTrueCollapsed IfFalseVisiblegt     ltcommonBaseApp.Resourcesgt ltcommonBaseAppgt codepre  pUserControl XAMLp  precodeltUserControl      xNameFormatsControl     xClassxyz.Formats     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008     xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006     mcIgnorabled     FontFamilyStaticResource PhoneFontFamilyNormal     FontSizeStaticResource PhoneFontSizeNormal     ForegroundStaticResource PhoneForegroundBrush     dDesignHeight480 dDesignWidth480gt      ltItemsControl BackgroundTransparent ItemsSourceBinding ElementNameFormatsControl, PathFormatAvailabilitiesgt         ltItemsControl.ItemsPanelgt             ltItemsPanelTemplategt                 ltStackPanel OrientationBinding ElementNameFormatsControl, PathOrientationgt             ltItemsPanelTemplategt         ltItemsControl.ItemsPanelgt         ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt             ltDataTemplategt                 ltGridgt                     ltTextBlock TextBinding BindsDirectlyToSourceTrue Margin0,0,10,0 VisibilityBinding ElementNameFormatsControl, PathFullText, ConverterStaticResource BoolToVisibilityConvertergt                     ltTextBlock TextBinding Description Margin0,0,10,0 VisibilityBinding ElementNameFormatsControl, PathFullText, ConverterStaticResource BoolToInvertedVisibilityConvertergt                 ltGridgt             ltDataTemplategt         ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt     ltItemsControlgt ltUserControlgt codepre  pUserControl CSp  precodenamespace xyz      public partial class Formats  UserControl              public static readonly DependencyProperty FormatAvailabilitiesDependencyProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterFormatAvailabilities, typeofFormatAvailability[], typeofFormats, null         public static readonly DependencyProperty OrientationDependencyProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterOrientation, typeofOrientation, typeofFormats, new PropertyMetadataOrientation.Horizontal         public static readonly DependencyProperty FullTextDependencyProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterFullText, typeofbool, typeofFormats, null          public FormatAvailability[] FormatAvailabilities                      get  return FormatAvailability[]base.GetValueFormats.FormatAvailabilitiesDependencyProperty              set  base.SetValueFormats.FormatAvailabilitiesDependencyProperty, value                    public Orientation Orientation                      get  return Orientationbase.GetValueFormats.OrientationDependencyProperty              set  base.SetValueFormats.OrientationDependencyProperty, value                    public bool FullText                      get  return boolbase.GetValueFormats.FullTextDependencyProperty              set  base.SetValueFormats.FullTextDependencyProperty, value                    public Formats                      InitializeComponent                codepre  pI must be over looking something...thanksp

Negative 1301 pThe a hrefhttpwww.spoj.pl relnofollowSPOJa is a website that lists programming puzzles, then allows users to write code to solve those puzzles and upload their source code to the server.

The frontend uses an enum and calls an EJB service at the backend with the enum as a parameter. But the enum changes frequently, so we dont want the backend to know its values.p  pstrongString constantsstrongp  pA possible solution would be to use String constants insteadof enums, but that would cause a lot of little changes at the frontend. Im searching a solution, which causes as few changes as possible in the frontend.p  pstrongWrapper classstrongp  pAnother solution is the usage of a wrapper class with the same interface as an enum. The enum becomes an wrapper class and the enum values become constants within that wrapper. I had to write some deserialization code to ensure object identity as enums do, but I dont know if it is a correct solution. What if different classloaders are used The wrapper class will implement a Java interface, which will replace the enum in the backend.

If the user submits from the Tweet box and is not currently logged in or is not connected with my site, heshe gets a popup from twitter asking for usernamepassword andor if heshe accepts the connection with my site.p  pIf the user accepts the popup is closed and all is good, if the user declines the window is just closed and the tweet remains a dream of what could have been.p  pSo far so good, But My site is mainly aimed at smartphones in particular iPhone, and if the user adds my site to the home screen which I recommend then the twitter popup fills the whole app window. This I can understand, and everything works out if the user accepts. p  pIf, on the other hand the user declines, there is no window for the button to close so noting happens. My webapp is running fullscreen and standalone so doesnt even have a back button. So if the user doesnt accept the twitter connect, heshe basically needs to restart the app to get avay from the popup.p  pSo finally   my question is this is there a twitter page that performs the connect authentication that is not required to be in a popup A page that basically sends you back to the callback url on both accept and cancel Or is there a different approach that I have over lookedp  pLooking forward to some helpful tipsp  pstrongEDITstrongp  hr  pI was suggested a hrefhttpdev.twitter.compagesauth relnofollowThe standard OAuth flowa and a hrefhttpdev.twitter.compagesintents relnofollowWeb intentsa, the problem is that the app needs to be client codejavascript only. This makes The standard OAuth flow impossible because it sends application secrets over httphttps wich makes me put the secrets in the javascript  I might be somewhat of a hobbyist programmer but there are limits  .p  pWeb intent pages dont have a cancelback button so Im still stuck if the user dont want to connect and is running my app in stanalone mode.p  pI guess I should have included this in the original post, thanks anyway for the suggestions.p

Negative 1301 pWe have a standard map MapTypeId.ROADMAP with a marker on it. Above the map is a button that says Show StreetView. If the user clicks on it, it loads StreetView at the position of the marker in the same div. The button changes to Hide StreetView and if clicked the map reverts back to the standard ROADMAP. Users can also use the pegman to simulate the same bahviour obviously.p  pThe problem began when there was no actual streetview available at the position of the marker. We handled this with an event listener, if no streetview was available a message is displayed informing the user, and returns false to prevent showing the non existant streetview. Worked great, except when the user tried to use the pegman  because we had already loaded but not displayed a streetview which wasnt there. When the user dropped the pegman on the map the first time nothing happened, but our ShowHide button changed. On the second drop of pegman it changed to streetview, but our showhide button was now out of kilter it was displaying show street view when already there, and hide street view when on ROADMAP.p  pWe tried changing our code structure  streetview var panorama  ... is only initialised through an onclick javascript function it was initially bundled in with the loadMap function, now it has been seperated to another function on our showhide button  if streetview available, great change to it and change the button, if not return false and display message to user. This works great, but now if the user uses the pegman to go to streetview the buttons do not change because it has been seperated into another function.p  pIm at my whits end, three days of trying all kinds of options and I cannot figure out how to listen in the loadMap function for a strongchange to streetview via pegman droppingstrong strongsee the visiblechanged event listener in the loadMap code belowstrong   If I can figure this out I can change the button display, but for the life of me I cannot figure it out investigated DOM mutations to listen for the display of streetview but not very cross browser friendly, which is important as the site gets over 4 million hits a month.p  pHere is the loadMap functionp  precodefunction loadGMaplat, lng, nachladenAnzeigen, radialConflict  Create the Map variables   mapDiv  document.getElementByIdmap  width  parseIntmapDiv.style.width  height  parseIntmapDiv.style.height  latlng  new google.maps.LatLnglat, lng   Create Map var mapOptions     zoom 14,   center latlng,   mapTypeId google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP,   scrollwheel false,   panControl false  map  new google.maps.MapmapDiv,mapOptions   ...

Negative 1301 pThis is one of those questions that is really frustrating for me to ask because Im sure the answer is out there, I just havent been able to word the searches correctly. Basically I am new to GUI programming done a decent amount of embedded CC and learning wxPython to start out.p  pIm making an app to read and write to a config file. So I have a StaticText to display the name of the parameter to be readwritten, a TextCtrl to display the value and allow user input, and then a Get button and a Set button. Ill call all of these together a group of widgets. For this app obviously this group will be repeated several times. Rather than write and maintain all that code by hand, I thought it would be easier to simply have a list of the config parameters I want to be able to edit, and then iterate through the list and generate an instance of this group of widgets for each item in the list. I made it work except for one thing I had to bind all of the Get buttons to the same function. Same thing with the Set buttons. Is there any way from within those functions to know which Get or Set button was pushed, and thus which parameter to find and edit in the config file Im sure theres a way to do this with parent or IDs or something but Im just too new to OOP.p

Negative 1301 pI have a form that has hidden elements in it to create a pseudoarray of commaseparated values that will be submitted to the server through post, where the hidden elements will then be decoded into arrays and processed for storage.  To fill the hidden elements, I use visible elements and a button that javascript handles to add values to the hidden elements, clearing the form every time the button is pressed.p  pHere is the question  How do I get the visible elements NOT to be submitted to the server and only submit the hidden elements in an effort to save bandwidth  Is there a way to create a text entry field that doesnt get submitted with the rest of the form, but that javascript and normal form controls can still access  The goal here is to prevent unnecessary repeats of the same data being sent when the submit button is clicked, AFTER javascript has filled the pseudoarrays with the data I need.p  pEDIT  Thanks for the help.  The first two answers I got were good, but I chose as an answer the one I thought was a little more detailed and helpful to myself and anyone else who may be looking for the same solutions.p  pPLAN Ill have an onsubmit script that disables unneeded fields just before submit so that they dont get sent to the server, thereby saving a tiny bit of bandwidth and reducing the amount of information my serverside script needs to do.  This keeps it possible to easily use javascript to clear the fields I want cleared while constantly keeping the hidden fields loaded with the CSVs I need.p

What am I doing wrong, that the GUI does not repaint on intermediate steps of the simulationp  precodepublic class NwSim       public NwSim          public static void mainString[] args         JFrame frame        Simulator simulator  new Simulator            canvas  new GUICanvas         create gui  canvas, which paints guy computers        canvas.setBackgroundColor.white        contentPane.addcanvas, BorderLayout.CENTER        frame.pack        frame.setVisibletrue    simulator.simulate       represents the controller in the simulation public class Simulator  ListltComputergt computers private int simulationSteps  public Simulator     simulationSteps  200               computers  new ArrayListltComputergt       public void simulate          forint step  0 step lt simulationSteps step          forComputer computer  computers          computer.tick                     public Computer createComputer      Computer computer  new Computer     computers.addcomputer          public class Computer extends Observable       public void tick      ..  update field state of the computer         if state.stateChanged              setChanged             notifyObservers    notify observer gui canvas that the state of computer has changed and it is time to repaint guiComputers                public string getState  return state     public class GUIComputer     private static final long serialVersionUID  1L  private int width  private int height     private Image image  private Computer computer     public GUIComputerint x, int y, Computer computer component, Image image       this.computer  computer      setXx      setYy      this.image  image      width  image.getWidthnull      height  image.getHeightnull      Override  public void drawGuiComputerGraphics g         g.drawImageimage, getX, getY, null         Graphics2D g2  Graphics2Dg         g2.drawStringcomputer.getState.toString, getX  20, getY     repaint the state for each guiComputer taken from Computer                   height  10    public class GUICanvas extends JPanel implements  Observer     private ListltGUIComputergt guiComputers  public GUICanvasSimulator simulator        this.guiComputers  new ArrayListltGUIComputergt      create guy computers using method createGuiComputer below , code omitted   public createGuiComputerTransferable transferable, Point dropPoint, Computer computer    Image image  Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit.getImageimages  imageName         Computer computer  simulator.createComputer                         GUIComputer guiComputer  new   GUIComputerdropPoint.x, dropPoint.y, computer, image                          guiComputers.addguiComputer                            guiComputer.addObserverthis        Override      public void paintComponentGraphics g           super.paintComponentg         Graphics2D g2  Graphics2Dg                   if GuiComputers.isEmpty                      forGUIComputer guiComputer  guiComputers                   redraw guiComputer                             guiComputer.drawGuiComputerg                                             Override     public void updateObservable o, Object o1      forfinal GUIComputer guiComputer  guiComputers                   ifguiComputer.getComputer.equalso                      if update requested by Computer object then update gui, redrawing all guiComputers                   revalidate                   repaint                       codepre

Negative 1301 pI have an Azure web role that accesses an external WCF based SOAP web service port 80 for various bits of data.  The response from this service is highly erratic.  I routinely get the following error.p  blockquote   pThere was no endpoint listening at    a hrefhttpwww.myexternalservice.comservice.svc relnofollowhttpwww.myexternalservice.comservice.svca that could accept the message. This is    often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action.p blockquote  pTo isolate the problem I created a simple console app to repetitively call this service in 1 second intervals and log all responses.p  precode    using var svc  new MyExternalService              stopwatch.Start         var response  svc.CallService         stopwatch.Stop         Logresponse, stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds           codepre  pIf I RDP to one of my Azure web instances and run this app it takes 10 to 20 attempts before it gets a valid response from the external service.  These first attempts are always accompanied by the above error.  After this warm up period it runs fine.  If I stop the app and then immediately restart, it has to go back through the same warm up period.p  pstrongHoweverstrong, if I run this same app from any other machine I receive valid responses immediately.  I have run this logger app on servers running in multiple data centers non Azure, desktops on different networks, etc...  These test runs are always very stable.p  pI am not sure why this service would react this way in the Azure environment.

Negative 1301 pI have some questions on MMIXs interrupt. The definition of the special register rK is interrupt mask register. But it seems it treat different event differently.p  ul lipfor IO bitslets call  bit  This is a normal case.  When an external interrupt come, if rKs  bit is 0, rQs  bit will hold 1 until rKs  bit is set to 1, and the trap will occur.pli lipfor Sbit program  Accroding to the sourcecode of codemmixpipecode, even when rKs Sbit is 0, a security exception will occur. and rKs Sbit will be alter from 0 to 1.  So, in positiveaddress, rKs Sbit should be 1, and in negativeaddress rKs Sbit dont have any effect.  Only rQs Sbit is used to tell system that there was a security issue, rKs Sbit seems useless.pli lipfor Pbit program  It is sad instruction comes from a privileged negative virtual address. in mmixdoc.pdf.  But if PC is in a negativeaddress, rQs Pbit will not always be set to 1. mmixpipe also not set rQs Pbit.  br I can prove it  If all the instructions that executed before the resume insn will set rQs Pbit to 1, then resume will also set rQs Pbit to 1.  As a result, after the resume, the user insn will always trigger a TRAP. that is impossible.  So when Pexception is inhibited, rQs Pbit will not set to 1. br  so rKs Pbit is not just used as a mask, it is used as a option to bypass a exceptionchecking.pli ul  hr  pHere are some questions.p  ul lipWhy not make all rKs bits just as a mask for interrupt Is there any reason made SP bits so strangepli lipdo other rQs program bits rwxnkb set to 1 if rKs corresponding bits is 0pli lipAs in Negaddress, trip will not occur, do DVWIOUZX bits hold 1 after it just happenedpli ul

Negative 1301 pIm making an ipad game using cocos2d and box2d.p  pAmong other elements, theres a fastmoving player object and a bunch of static line objects.  I want the lines to detect when the player crosses them but not to act like a wall to the player object or any other moving objects in the game.  So Ive got the lines set to be sensors.p  pHowever, the nifty antitunneling code that Box2D has for fastmoving object collision detection doesnt seem to apply to bodies that are set as sensors.

Ive browsed other sites and it seems that no animated gifs work in Safari mobile on Android, but Ive been unable to find a documented confirmation that this is the case. Does anyone know why the android browser doesnt show animated gifs  Is there a workaround for this  Ive seen lots of topics about showing animation in a WebView in a native app, but none for straight web apps.  Do I have to create the image with css animationp  pThanks very muchp
Negative 1301 pI am trying to upgrade a python script that runs an executable on windows and manages the text output files to a version that uses multiple threaded processes so I can utilize more than one core. I have four separate versions of the executable which each thread knows to access. This part works fine. Where I run into problems is when they are running simultaneously and try to open the different output files to ensure they ran correctly and react depending on the contents of the output file.p  pSpecifically, when running three threads, two will crash with the following error, while one continues to workp  precodeException in thread Thread4 Traceback most recent call last   File CPython27libthreading.py, line 552, in bootstrapinner     self.run   File EHDAHDA1.0.1Hm1.0.1.py, line 782, in run     conf  self.conffileRun   File EHDAHDA1.0.1Hm1.0.1.py, line 729, in conffile     l  openself.rundirRunRun, r.readlines     list of file lines IOError [Errno 2] No such file or directory PathtoOutputfile codepre  pThis results from the thread not correctly running the executable i.e. why PathtoOutputfile was not created and hence cant be found. But one of the threads does this correctly while the other two cannot. Is there a reason why I cant get multiple threads running different versions of an executablep
Negative 1301 pWe have a Maven built Netbeans 7.1 rcp application that successfully mixes OSGi modules packaging bundle and Netbeans modules packaging nbm by wrapping the OSGi modules in Netbeans module wrappers. We want to migrate from using these wrappers to using the OSGi modules directly to simplify the build. There are around 30 wrapper, osgi module pairs and I would like to tackle the removal of the wrappers, one module pair at a time.p  pHowever when we replace a specific wrapper dependency with its osgi dependency in a modules pom that depends on it, and use thep  precode    ltuseOSGiDependenciesgttrueltuseOSGiDependenciesgt codepre  pin the nbmmavenplugin configuration. Any other dependencies to other wrappers suddenly fail to build with transitive dependencies not available at runtime error.p  pProject uses classes from transitive module [xxx] which will not be accessible at runtime.p  p where [xxx] is the name of the OSGi module.p  pOf course I can fix the build by replacing the wrapper dependencies with the OSGi modules they were wrapping, but that escalates the size of the migration task considerably.  Once Ive got a build by fixing these transient dependencies the OSGi module that I picked to migrate appears successfully in a new cluster extra. But at runtime the rcp fails to find the other osgi modules because, I guess, elsewhere in the build, they are still being referenced through wrappers.p  pIs there any way these wrappers and direct OSGi dependencies can coexist Or do I have to migrate all of the Netbeans wrappers to OSGi in one gop  pMany thanks,p  pPhil Wilkinson.p

It actually creates all the elements, and it loads images as well. But there is function called loadImage which is intended to preload images and then save the information that this images has been already loaded and are propably cached. I am calling it with callback function which handles the loaded image and sets it as a background to appropriate element.Hence I need to hold the information about the element like pointer, or indexposition. Now I am trying to propagate its index to the function, but because the callback function is called after some time the position variable has already other value the for loop actually goes through and in all calls of the callback it is set to the maximum valuep  pI know I can alter the loadImage function and add the position as another attribute, but I would prefere any other solution. I do not want to alter the loadImage function.p

Negative 1301 pSo, Ive been generating different scaffolds trying to use the OnetoMany relationship features of Tower, but I cant figure out how to actually link up the related instances to make use of the relationship.  For instance, my most recent scaffolds were generated like thisp  precodetower generate scaffold User emailstring firstNamestring lastNamestring hasManyposts  tower generate scaffold Post titlestring bodytext userIdinteger belongsTouser codepre  pNow, in rails, that userId field, on the post model, would form a connection with the user sharing that id, and then you could use that to access the relationship.  But here it doesnt seem to do anything.  Trying to use any of the code from here a hrefhttpsgithub.comviatropostowerwiki1n relnofollowhttpsgithub.comviatropostowerwiki1na just gives me errors.p  pIn the tower console, I was able to create an example user and post I can also do this easily enough by running the server and using the forms on the web page, like sop  precodetowergt user  new App.User  towergt user.attributes   email billbill.com, firstName bill, lastName billiams   towergt post  new App.Post  towergt post.attributes   title A Post, body This is a short post., userId 4fbf23224503fe670e000006  codepre  pAnd these instances are persisted to the database, but when I try code likep  precodetowergt user.getposts.exists codepre  pI get TypeError Cannot call method exists of undefined.  Similarly, callingp  precodetowergt user.getposts.createtitle Berlin never sleeps. codepre  pproduces TypeError Cannot call method create of undefined.  The same sort of thing happens if I try anything like this in the models or controllers.  Im really stuck here, and have been trying for several days to figure out how this works, but I dont know where else to look.  If anyone has example code I could peek at, that would be awesome, otherwise an explanation of sorts would be helpful also.

Negative 1301 pSo my problem is fairly simple. When I started to develop my website my default zoom level on my Firefox browser turned out to be, well, less than 100. Maybe 70 Which means that what I have designed so far is actually in zoomed out mode, which in turn means that my users or web visitors will see something that looks very zoomed in when they look at it with 100 mode. This can easily be solved by holding Ctrl and scrolling you mouse wheel twice. Obviously though I cant encourage people to do that.p  pSo,p  pIs there some function or property in either HTML, CSS or Javascript than can set the default zoom level to zoomed outp

Negative 1301 pI am used to JUnit running Before methods in a superclass before Before methods in a subclass.

Negative 1301 pI try to create one MVC Application with Swing. And I am confused with the implementation and how things should be.

The Random codes generated with a button  on the controller class in a method . The random codes are generated and then i want to save them on a database. I am confused how to save the generated codes on the database. Should i create a method in the Class Named Controller so that i can save them from there Or another different class with save update find.......... methods If Yes then why I have create the Model class with Model properties And how can I use the Model class. what is only left to understand how to use the Model class if I have to use it or if I just have to have this class so that is there. What is the use of Model class if its only to be there with the properties and do save some where else What approach is usually used so that I am ok with MVC pattern Am I confused Any help I forget to tell that I use Hibernate. thanks  ps. I have also read this  a hrefhttpjava.sun.comproductsjfctscarticlesarchitecture relnofollowhttpjava.sun.comproductsjfctscarticlesarchitecturea  but i didnt understand it.p  precodepublic class code this is the Model     private int i     public void setterint i         this.ii           public int getter         return i           public String generateStringInt          return new BigInteger190, random.toString32            what ever i want to create with the int i variable i will do it on this class     then i will pass it on the controller to sent it on the view       OR save if i want to save it.Is this way of thinking right     Or is there any other way to do it       if i have a Button and press it from the View it will generate this methodor      i have to do it else     public String generateStringInt          return new BigInteger190, random.toString32           then if i want to save i can just do it like   session.saveobject or is there any other way codepreli ol  pis it better now  Thanks p
Negative 1301 pOk, this is some recursive thing, and I dont know how to do this in Apache. I want this I have some folders, let say codetest.web.comcode, codewebsitecode. Now this is what should happenp  p1 When visiting code....[...].test.web.comcode, check whether that directory exists. If not, try whether code..[...].test.web.comcode exists. So one level higher. Repeat step 1 in that case. So for example, when I visit codea.b.test.web.comcode, it will first check if codea.b.test.web.comcode exists, if exists, it will load that folder. If not, it will test for codeb.test.web.comcode, if that does not exists it will test for codetest.web.comcode which finally existsp  p2 When still no folder exists, use the codewebsitecode folder. So for example, when I go to codebla.web.comcode, it cannot find such a directory, so it will load codewebsitecode.p  pHow can I get this workingp

I have started to make a php commandline program that also uses the phpsdk as my web app does. The only problem is that as the php commandline program runs outside the browser it does not have access to the session to pickup the accesstoken which makes the program display 0 for getuser. I have thought that storing the accesstoken in the db as well as the others, and fetching this from the db and setting it, then the program should display the user as well as have access to the Graph API. Then how could it check if the accesstoken as changed if im not logged in through the web app which it can not change the accesstoken due to theres no auth interaction to the command program.p  pThanksp

Negative 1301 pMy understanding from reading the docs runs something like thisp  ol liclient is a subclass of TestCase.

We can create new Client instances and sometimes its helpful to do so.li liYet somehow, when we type codeself.clientcode, what we are referring to is a particular Client that was instantiated when the TestCase was created, and strongnotstrong the client class one layer below TestCase. li ol  pIs this correct If so, how is this the case  something to do with Superclassesp

Negative 1301 pWhats the best data structure for a fixed length stack I originally called it a queue, but what I want is a stack where items are added to the front, and every time an item is added to the front an item is removed from the end Various lengths of subvectors will be accessed from the front also. I was using vectors, now thinking about clojure.lang.PersistentQueue and finger trees.p  pedit, to clarify, something likep  precodegt def q queue [1 2 3 4] [1 2 3 4] gt push q 9 8 7 [7 8 9 1] gt peek push q 9 8 7 7 codepre  pedit2 thanks for all your answers so far, this has turned into an exercise in going back to basics and reading Joy of Clojure, learning for instance that subvec of subvec retains a reference to the first subvecs vector, while something like vec cons x subvec... would if used repeatedly accrue references to all intermediate subvecs. In light of this, how about this implementation of push for a vectorbased queue p  precodedefn push [v i n] if gt count v n conj subvec v 1 n i conj v i   codepre  pthen the resulting vector could be accessed via rseq which I believe is fast with vectors due to its use of indexoffsetp

Negative 1301 pIm trying to generify old code, and there is some code where, given something like codeInteger.classcode, it returns codeInteger.TYPEcode and viceversa, and so on for the rest of the wrappers if the input is not a wrapper, it returns the input class.

Of course, we can always explicitly cast to codeClassltTgtcode.  The question is, is this cast safe, and thus I can be comfortable in adding the codeSuppressWarningsuncheckedcode annotationp
Negative 1301 pI am a little new to Ninject so i am having a little trouble working out if this is even possible let alone how to do it.p  pBasically i want to have a directory with a number of plugin dlls that get loaded at runtime. All the plugins in the dlls will implement 2 interfaces.  The first interface will be IPlugin and will contain methods to intilalise the plugin and stop it. The rest of the interfaces will be interfaces for features that plugin suppliesimplements. When i need something that implements 1 of those interfaces i ask ninjectplugin manager for the instance of all the plugins that implement that featureinterface so i can call them. The other catch is i need as single instance of each plugin to be loaded and returned so if a plugin implements 3 interfacesfeatures the single instance would be returned when ever i ask for any of those featuresinterfaces.p  pLastly i need this all done dynamically as in with no config xml file or hardcoded mappings. Also if possible i would love to use ninject to populate the constructor properties if possible but if that is too hard i can do that via methods on the IPlugin interface.p  pI know this is more than a little complicated but i am hoping someone can help me out or at least point me in the right direction. I have looked at most of the other posts on plugin systems but they are based on a common interface.  In my case the common interface is for setup only and the rest of the interfaces are different so none of them seem to match.  Also if possible i didnt want the plugins to reference ninject in any way if possible.p  pSo far i have tried the following and it seems to work so i just need to do some dependencies between plugins nowp  precodepublic class PluginManagerIDisposable      IKernel kernel      public PluginManager              kernel  new StandardKernel          kernel.Bind                x gt x.FromThisAssembly                      .SelectAllClasses.InheritedFromltIPlugingt                      .BindAllInterfaces                      .Configurec gtc.InSingletonScope             public T GetPluginInstanceltTgt              return kernel.GetltTgt           public IEnumerableltTgt GetAllPluginInstancesltTgt              return kernel.GetAllltTgt           public void Dispose              kernel.Dispose       codepre

Negative 1301 pConsider a Java class hierarchy such asp  precodeabstract class Exp  public void generate  class EffExp extends Exp ... clas PureExp extends Exp ... class NewExp extends EffExp ... etc, etc. codepre  pThe implementation of codegeneratecode inside codeNewExpcode was changed to throw an codeIOExceptioncode.p  precodepublic void generate throws IOException ... codepre  pThe other implementations of codegeneratecode dont do any IO hence dont need to throw it. The compiler complains and forces me to declare all methods in the class hierarchy to throw the exception. Is this really the only way forward It seems rather intrusive.p  pI could of course catch the exception where it happens, inside codeNewExpcode, but that doesnt really make sense. The exception should propagate to the top and stop the program execution.p  pThe more general question here is if you have a hierarchy of methods that override each other, do they all have to be declared to throw the same set of exceptionsp

Negative 1301 pI have a problem, im using glut the openGL utility toolkit. Im making a subwindow in a mainwindow. The mainwindow displays a simple figure and the subwindow displays the figure from another view. The figure rotates so the mainwindow and the subwindow should always be redisplayed.p  pBut only one of the two displays the rotating figure. So when I start the program the figure in the mainwindow rotates but in the subwindow it dont rotate, it just stands still.p  pWhen I move my mouse in the subwindow and press any key the roles changes so the figure rotates in the subwindow and stands still in the mainwindow.p  pHow can I let them both display simultaneous. I followed the tutorial from Lighthouse, but it didnt give me an answer. Do I have to do something with my viewportp  precode  GLUT Shapes Demo     Written by Nigel Stewart November 2003     This program is test harness for the sphere, cone   and torus shapes in GLUT.

Negative 1301 pMy colleagues and I have encountered an apparent bug in Cs Graphics class. In our application, we update a bitmap over time by drawing new things on top of it. We use the Graphics.DrawImageImage, Rectangle method, and sometimes the call never returns, or even throw an exception. Is that an issue with which any of you are familiarp  pHeres our use casep  precodeBitmap whole  ... codepre  pThis is defined well before our issue arises. The normal call looks like this, with part and region coming in from the network.p  precodeBitmap part  ... Rectangle region  ...  usingvar graphics  Graphics.FromImagewhole     usingpart           graphics.DrawImagepart, region  Execution stops in here      codepre  pWe tried putting a timeout on itp  precode...       var someAttributes  ... part ...        var drawing  Task.Factory.StartNew gt graphics.DrawImagepart, region        if drawing.Wait5000                 We put a breakpoint here        ... codepre  pWe tried inspecting the part image. Before the call, it looks ok its not disposed or anything and were able to get its properties. But after the call, all its members throw InvalidOperationException.p  pIf we let the program continue after this, the next calls will hang every single time. If we pause the debugger some time later, we can see in Threads view that these drawing tasks are still waiting. p  pSo if you know of any workaround, or a way to prevent this behaviour, your help will be greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT shortly afterp  pWe looked into the graphics object and found that we could not inspect it because this object is currently in use elsewhere. We thought that this was the only reference to the whole image. We even cloned the image to display it in a picture box.   We read up on Clone and found out, if we understood correctly, that it only does a shallow copy and still shares resources with the old image.p  pSo we tried to replacep  precodeRectangle subregion  ... Bitmap copy  whole.Clonesubregion codepre  pwithp  precodeRectangle subregion  ... Bitmap copy  new Bitmapwhole.Clonesubregion codepre  pand it seems to have solved our issue. Though its still a problem that DrawImage doesnt throw an exception in that case.p

Negative 1301 pWhile using the widget commands addwidget and clearwidgets, I am getting my widgets, which look fine by themselves, to be incredibly tiny on the bottom left corner of the screen.p  pIm going to explain all my steps here, so please bear with me.p  pI have a system in place to switch from one Widget to another. The Widget is basically the entire form, the base canvas and layout.p  pAs I understand it, these must have a base layout.

Negative 1301 pIm currently working on a HTMLCSS template, and Im going to implement the following social media iconsp  pa hrefhttpwww.premiumpixels.comfreebies41socialmediaiconspng relnofollowhttpwww.premiumpixels.comfreebies41socialmediaiconspngap  pThey come as 41 seperate .png files. I want to include them into my template using CSS classes, for easy usage like sop  precodelti classicontwittergtltigt lti classiconfacebookgtltigt codepre  pNow the question is, should I refer to each icon as a separate file in my CSS classes, or should I consolidate all 41 icons into one sprite and adjust the background position for each class CSS sprites techniquep  pIt is quite obvious that probably nobody using my theme will use 41 social media icons on his website hopefully. I would say on the average site, about 3 or 4 icons are used at once. So this makes me wonder if it makes sense at all, to use the sprites technique when only ever about one tenth 4 of 41 is used. p  pThe file sizes for the single files average at about 2kb per file. The sprite I created is 42kb in size.p  pWhat is the best solution for this scenariop  pAlso Does it matter how the icons in a sprite are distributed I just made 2 columns and 21 rows of icons. It might as well be one column and 41 rows, or 6 columns and 7 rows.p  pCheersp

Negative 1301 pWe are looking to decrease the execution time of segmentationencoding from wav to aac segmented for HTTP live streaming using ffmpeg to segment and generate a m3u8 playlist by utilizing all the cores of our machine.p  pIn one experiment, I had ffmpeg directly segment a wav file into aac with libfdkaac, however it took quite a long time to finish.p  pIn the second experiment, I had ffmpeg segment a wav file as is wav which was quite fast lt 1 second on our machines, then use GNU parallel to execute ffmpeg again to encode the wav segments to aac and manually changed the .m3u8 file without changing their durations. This was performed much faster however silence gaps could be heard when streaming the output audio.p  pI have initially tried the second scenario using mp3 and result was still quite the same.

Negative 1301 pI am currently developping a web application using ASP.NET MVC 4. Here is a description of the problem I am facing p  pI created a stronglytyped view in order to edit some fields of a table, and in particular a codeDateTimecode field.

Since I am talking about dates, I also have added this in my web.config p  precodeltglobalization uiCulturefrFr culturefrFR gt codepre  pNow the fun part is that, when displayed, the date has a MMDDYYYY format instead of a DDMMYYYY one, which is the one saved in the database. Moreover, when I just want to display the codeViewBag.DefaultValuecode in a div, it shows the correct format, ie DDMMYYYY.p  pHas anyone faced some similar issues I can understand that my description can be rather vague, but I really dont understand what is going on there.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1301 pPosts 53   posted Today 14838 PM  0br I am developing a jaxws web service proof of concept in RAD 8.0.4 and running in WebSphere 7. Our app uses Spring and Hibernate, but were not exactly experts in either. We need to enable global transactions with our web service so it can work with the transactions of client apps. I followed the insctructions I found on various websites, including IBMs, and I thought I configured everything and it doesnt work. Each transaction client and service work fine independently, but I forced an exception before commit in my client. This rolls back the client transaction, but not the service transaction. Furthermore, the logging on websphere not the simply systemout one...the trace from the admin console spits out some gobbledygook that implies to me that no transaction context was offered from the client. p  pI initially set the policies in both the services view of RAD and the admin console, but Ive since read that if you set both, it doesnt work. But I have since tried just one and just the other and neither work. Heres what i did p  pIn my wsdl I added p  precodeltwspPolicy wsuIdATPolicygt      ltwspExactlyOnegt          ltwsat11ATAssertiongt          ltwsat10ATAssertiongt          lt omitted assertions gt      ltwspExactlyOnegt    ltwspPolicygt   codepre  pand the wspPolicyReference line p  precodeltbinding nameTxPortBinding typetnsTxDelegategt    ltsoapbinding styledocument transporthttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoaphttpgt    ltoperation nameinsertDBTransgt     ltwspPolicyReference URIATPolicy requiredtruegt            ltsoapoperation soapActiongt      ltinputgt        ltsoapbody useliteralgt      ltinputgt      ltoutputgt        ltsoapbody useliteralgt      ltoutputgt    ltoperationgt    ltbindinggt   codepre  pIn the admin console version, after importing the WSTransaction policy, I navigated to ServicesService ProvidersTxService, and selected the checkbox of all three level, TxService, TxPort, and insertDBTrans. Chose Attach Policy SetWSTransaction. Click the disabled link on the service, and chose exported WSDL. Ok amp Save. p  pThen to ServicesService ClientsTxService. Check client, Attach Client Policy SetWSTransaction. Client and provier policy chosen. p  pBut that didnt work. So I remove them, and instead go into the services view of RAD. Right clicked on the service, manage policy sets. Put WSTransaction on the first page with Provider Sample as binding attached. Its set all the way down to the operation name  insertDbTrans. p  pUnder the client in the services view I set the client to user provider policy, second page, chose WSTransaction for the default entry and it set to client and provider. p  pI actually tried more permutations than this. But none of them worked. p  pAny ideas what I am doing wrong here Or at least a narrowing down of the general problem Am I close to rightp

Negative 1301 pI have a program written in Java that creates 5 threads which select data from Oracle. The select is like thisp  precodeselect  from queuerequests where requeststatus  0 and daterequested lt sysdate and rownum lt  for update skip locked codepre  pI set the parameter to 1024. I often get the following result using System.out.printlnp  blockquote   pTHREAD 0 UPDATE 1024p      pTHREAD 4 UPDATE 0p      pTHREAD 1 UPDATE 0p      pTHREAD 2 UPDATE 0p      pTHREAD 3 UPDATE 0p blockquote  pSo, only one thread finds rows to update.  From what i found in different articles, i think oracle firstly applies the strongrownumstrong clause and after that strongfor update skip lockedstrong, so all the threads try to update the first 1024 rows.  I could probably use something likep  precodeselect  from select  from queuerequests where requeststatus  0 and daterequested lt sysdate for update skip locked where rownum lt  codepre  pBut this will lock all the rows and after that will return a part of them. I dont want to lock all the rows.p  pI found a solution which created stored procedures, but i cant alter anything in the database.

Negative 1301 pI have a python code that performs some fairly intense computations, and then generates a plot png file for display on the web. Im using python, flask, modwsgi, and apache. Since the computation takes several seconds around 10 seconds, Id like to display a LOADING type image while the computation is happening so that the viewer doesnt think the server is messed up, and then the actual image when computations are complete. How can I do this from the server side not using javascript in the web browser In the past I remember seeing a lot of web pages where it seemed like the server was pushing a new page to the browser from what a recall most it was search engines on message forums. The answer to this question I believe is really an http related question, so it doesnt necessarily have to be specific to serving an image it could be an html page, or using python, flask, modwsgi, or apache, but it would be great if an example could be giving for just that configuration.p

Negative 1301 pIm very new to coding and have run into an odd roadblock with an ifelse program. There are a lot comments in my code to explain whats going on, so Ill just post the code, but the basic problem is that when I try to simplify the nested statements, I only get one condition executed overriding all the other conditions. For instance, if I want something to happen when x  4, only that condition gets executedeven if its false However, if I state it as x lt 5 ampamp x  3 then the program works fine appropriate executions for true and false conditions, but that seems messyespecially since I want certain responses for multiple inputs.p  pI searched the site and couldnt find this specific issue, and the Similar Questions dont seem to apply either.

My assumption is that                 by virtue of ending the loop, a line break was created                       ifguess  5Outside the loop, we need to specify the correct answer                   because the loop is only working while the answer in incorrect         coutltltGood job. ltltguessltlt is rightn          cin.getThis keeps the program from closing after completion  Done codepre

Negative 1301 pOK I have a mySQL table that has a few date columns in, it is set up so that there is a create date and a update date. The UpdateTimeStamp column updates automatically using the on update CURRENTTIMESTAMP Attributes,  Its my understanding that you can only use a one timestamp in this special way, and this is fine.p  pSo on the createdate column I need to manually add the date that the record was created its a datetime column.p  pI have read that you can use the NOW command for this. However using it in the following brings me a undefined function error. I have tried it as just CreateDate  NOW, which gives the same error or using CreateDate  setvalueNOW, does not produce an error but no value is entered into the database for this column. p  precodeformdata  array     ClientID gt setvalueClientID,     ClientReference gt setvalueClientReference,     CreateDate gt setvalueNOW,     Gender gt setvalueGender,     MaritalStatus gt setvalueMaritalStatus,     ContactNumber gt setvalueContactNumber,     Nationality gt setvalueNationality,     Ethnicity gt setvalueEthnicity,     ClientNotes gt setvalueClientNotes  codepre  pI Have tried all the answers you have provided and its still not working its letting me add to the database but the CreateDate value is 00000000 000000 p

Negative 1301 pHere is the scenario that I am trying to implement There are some UI elements buttons that need to be disabledenabled basing on some validation rules. A button can depend on two or more validation rules. Also same validation rule can be bound to multiple buttons.  A rule evaluates to truefalse, but this depends on external factors and keeps on changing with time For example if the temperature is  100F the button needs to enabled, so the rule is to be hooked up with an interface which will send the input to rule the temperature basing on which the rule will set itself to true or false.p  pInitially I thought of using pubsub pattern with pull model where rules are the publishers and the UI elements are subscribers, when the rule changes its status i.e. true to false or viceversa the rule notifies its subscribers, and then the subscriber asks the rule for its statustrue or false and can enabledisable itself, but in this approach will not work if a button depends on two validation rules. In pubsub pattern can a subscriber maintain list of publishers it is tied up with, is this a good approach If my subscribers also maintain list of publishers, as soon as as it gets notification from a single publisher it will request status of all the publishers and then take decisions to enabledisable.p  pLet me know if this is a good approach for my scenario of if there is any other pattern that suits my scenario more.p  pThanks for going through my long post.p

Negative 1301 pI have a django application that uses a postgres DB.p  pI have a chef recipe that sets up the postgres DB, including setting up a postgres usernamepassword for the django app to use.p  pThis usernamepassword is then used by the DATABASES settings.py value.p  pAt the moment I have to have the postgres details in both codeattributes.rbcode strongandstrong in codesettings.pycode. How can I have them in just one placep  pOptions I have currently consideredp  ol lipHaving codesettings.pycode or part of it generated by a chef template. That way the details only need to be in the chef recipe. The downside of this is that the django app is incomplete unless it is deployed via chef. This might not be that much of an issue, as even local dev is done with vagrantchef.pli lipHaving a known file on the filesystem that codesettings.pycode checks and loads some values from. This file is generated by chef. This is only a little bit better than the first solution. Also it requires some boilerplate code in settings.py to load and parse the file.pli lipHave the details in codesettings.pycode and let chef extract them somehow. This approach is problematic because it muddles with the ordering in the chef recipe I have to check out my django app, extract the value, use the values to set up postgres, and then start django. That itself might not be too bad, but the real issue comes whenif I want to move to a system where passwords arent in sourcecontrolled files but in something like chefs databags.pli ol  pIve googled quite a bit, but other than various discussions on the layout of codesettings.pycode and general talk about how to use django and chef, I cant find a nice solution. Surely someone else has deployed a django app with postgres using chef and come across this beforep
Negative 1301 pPolymorphism it is a common and widely used OO principle in such languages as Java and C.But Im curious can we achieve such functionality  capability of an action or method to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon in Java e.g. or C without using virtual methods dispatching CRTP and static polymorphism in C not the case  it is too narrow and language specific but with some more different even orthogonal approach or patterns May be we can use something from functional programmingp

Negative 1301 pAll p  pI am trying to understand when I would use the attached behavior pattern creating a static class and registering DP properties through RegisterAttached versus Property andor Data Triggers in a datagrid. Looking for common usecases of both strongspecially in a WPF datagrid scenariostrongp  pMy understanding is that when I want to do something with data in code behind and keeping MVVM intact  I would be using Attached behavior pattern where the default command is not available and hence extends the functionality like double click, multirow select etc similar to Extension methods whereas I would use triggers in combination with StylesTemplates when I want to set something visually on the grid like a certain value would flash a certain color on the cell etcp  pI can think of one  if I need to multiselect 3 rows in datagrid and then click the delete button  assuming that is a perfect candidate for Attached Behavior. p  pemPlease note  I am not asking the definitions of Attached Properties andor Triggers. I very well understand them. Looking more for guidance on real world usage.em p  pCan the experts plz provide some insight p  pThanksp

Both of them are connected to the same network and are able to ping each other. p  precodepublic class ServerActivity extends Activity   private TextView serverStatus private Button Start private Button Mark private Button Stop  DEFAULT IP public static String SERVERIP  10.0.2.15   DESIGNATE A PORT public static final int SERVERPORT  6000  private Handler handler  new Handler  private ServerSocket serverSocket  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain     serverStatus  TextView findViewByIdR.id.serverstatus      Start  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.start     Mark  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.mark     Stop  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.stop       SERVERIP  getLocalIpAddress      Thread fst  new Threadnew ServerThread     fst.start     public class ServerThread implements Runnable       public void run          try              if SERVERIP  null                  handler.postnew Runnable                      Override                     public void run                          serverStatus.setTextListening on IP   SERVERIP   SERVERPORT                                                       serverSocket  new ServerSocketSERVERPORT                 while true                       LISTEN FOR INCOMING CLIENTS                     final Socket client  serverSocket.accept                     handler.postnew Runnable                          Override                         public void run                              serverStatus.setTextConnected.                                                                    try                                  handler.postnew Runnable                                  Override                                 public void run                                       DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO THE FRONT END                                      THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN BE CREATIVE                                       Log.dServerActivity, S Sending command.

Negative 1301 pAfter yesterdays phonegap 3.0 plugin reinstall, the capture plugin now crashes on android Unfortunately, app has stopped. p  pThe capture plugin was working just fine on build before this.p  pBut now after reinstalling all the plugins and resetting the app up from scratch.  The app builds fine.  I can capture video or images, but when choosing to save the image or video, the app crashes reporting Unfortunately, app has stopped. instead of returning the image or video to the next process. i.e. captureSuccess  callback functionp  pIt never makes it to captureFailure callback function, the app actually crashes out and closes.p  pIf you cancel the video or image capture, after capturing, it will return back to the captureFailure callback function with the error code that the operation was cancelled. p  pSo what is my question  Has something changed with the new version of the capture plugin.p  pI noticed that something was different because in the plugins folder, instead of the plugin folder being called org.apache.cordova.core.mediacapture its now called org.apache.cordova.mediacapture  so I suspect that the new folder naming convention is not the only thing that has changed. At most the older plugin version was a week ago, and this one is new as of the date of this post.p  pI do have to reinstall plugins periodically.  For some reason the android.json file in the plugins folder gets corrupted now and then.  Usually surrounding the install of more plugins.   When this happens the app will no longer build and install and so I redo the app from scratch pulling it down from the repo and then installing all the plugins via a shell script that I made to automate this.  p  pAnyone else having this crashing problemp  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this  All other plugins seems to be working just fine.  Just having a problem with the capture plugin.p

Negative 1301 pIm using llvmmc with the goal of making a relatively smart disassembler identifying and tracking locals, easily following branches, etc, and part of that is creating a string representation of the disassembled instructions.p  pWhen I started this, I expected that I would be able to relatively easily identify registers and values used by codeMCInstcodes and whip out another representation myself with which I could easily work with. However, after some investigation, I realized that the correlation between the operands shown with the textual representation of an instruction and the operands that are actually present within the codeMCInstcode object is fairly low. Here are a few examples Intel syntaxp  ul liMoving, say, 11587 as a 32bit immediate into codeeaxcode would be done with the codeMOV32ricode opcode. The textual representation would be codemov eax, 11587code. The corresponding codeMCInstcode would have two operands, a register and an immediate. This works for me. This is great.li liAdding code11587code to codeeaxcode would be done with the codeADD32ricode opcode. The textual representation would be codeadd eax, 11587code. However, this time, the corresponding codeMCInstcode has emthreeem operands codeeaxcode is there twice and the immediate is in the end. This isnt so great. I can assume that this is an artifact of the lowering process, that the first instance of codeeaxcode is the destination register and that the second one is there to be the source even though x86 does not distinguish between the two, and I can hack around that.li liMoving a 32bits codeeipcoderelative value to codeeaxcode would be done with the codeMOV32ao32code opcode. The textual representation would be codemov eax, dword ptr [11587]code. In this case, the codeMCInstcode doesnt even have an operand for codeeaxcode, it can only be inferred from the operand type present in the opcode name. I can hack around that too, but things are getting less and less pretty and Ive only run into 56 different opcodes out of Godonlyknows how many opcodes x86 supports.li ul  pObviously, for the purpose of showing text, I could get the textual representation with an codeMCInstPrintercode, but the mapping between whats shown there and what the codeMCInstcode has is still muddy.p  pIs there a straightforward way to tell which operands appears in the textual representation of an instructionp

Negative 1301 pWe have users in our system that have contacts attached to them. So we implemented this by having a foreign key in our contacts table that pointed back to its owning user in the users table. But now we need to add functionality that requires a user to have a default contact. So I have added a column for the default contact of a user that points to the contacts table as a foreign key. Note the tables below.p  pThe two tables I have chopped them down to the relevant columnsp  precodeusers table       userid varchar20 PK       defaultcontact bigint FK to contacts.id nullable  contacts table       id bigint PK       userid varchar20 FK to users.userid codepre  pNotice the circular Foreign Keys.p  pNow I want to add a constraint to the users table that says that the defaultcontact can only be a contact that belongs to that user ie. the contacts userid  the userid of the user who has it as a default contact. I am now stuck because I am unsure how to add this constraint. This potentially could be solved by an assertion, but as I am using SqlServer assertions are not supported. This must be a common problem, because this is the second time in two days that we have come across a similar scenario in two completely different cases.p  pSo is it even possible to add this constraint If so, how would I go about doing sop  hr  h2EDIT  Jan 15 2014 0339 UTCh2  pSo I have found one way I can do this, which is to add the constraint in via checks in a stored procedure. This will work as long as we always access the users.defaultcontact field via stored procedure, but I was wondering if there are any other strict solutions.p

Negative 1301 pIm working on complex web app that is using the dojo toolkit for organization of the js files which is basically a requireJS module loader.p  pIm trying to figure it out how can i obfuscate all of my requiredefine modules in the .net web app... with a hrefhttpyuicompressor.codeplex.com relnofollowYUI Compressora i can minify all of the modules but i cannot obfuscate them because every module exposes some methods that are used in another modules... p  pI have read that maybe r.js optimizer using NodeJS will do the trick because will walk the entire dependency tree, including each module that it finds but the build process of the project that i work on is very complex and its automated... all of 150 .NET projects including the web app are build and deployed with separate build system and i need to automate the obfuscation of the js files.So i need some .net assailable that can obfuscate js files that are organized with DojorequireJSp  pThanks  p

Negative 1301 pI have developed a commercial extension for the Unity3D game engine in F, its a piece of code which extends the editor with advanced nodegraph editing features. F is perfect for this due to the nature of immutability and DUs. p  pBut, to my question I realized that the license for the FSharp.Core.dll which comes with Microsoft .NETVisual Studio probably doesnt allow you to redistribute it with a commercial project How would I go about finding out if this is the case or not, and if its not is there any way to create my own compiled version of FSharp.Core.dll which would run on Unity3Dp  pThe reason I ask is because Unity3D uses Mono 2.6 albeit a modified version, to my understanding under the hood, and there is no FSharp.Core.dll bundled with the editor, so I need to supply my own with my extension.p

Negative 1301 pI know this question has been asked before and i have seen a couple of possible solutions, but i cant seem to be able to make any of them work for my script.  My script is not a finished product, needs some cleaning up, but it definitely works at the moment.  p  pThe basic function of the script is that it creates snapshots of virtual machines, and then clones them for backup purposes.  Everything works as expected, but the problem is it brings my vcenter to its knees because it is flooding it with too many jobs at once.  I was wanting to limit the amount of jobs that run at once to maybe 34 at the same time.  Can anyone give me a hand  Thanks in advance...

Negative 1301 pI am working on a project based on soapUI where i want to be able to generate XMLs on the fly and allow users to store information in an excel.p  pI thought of two approaches that might work to solve my problemp  pIn the strongfirststrong approach i would read an xml, generate Xpaths from it, create columns based on the element names and maintain an xpath to column name map. I would then use this map to generate xmls on the fly. I was going to achieve all of this using XSLT. I was able to make some progress by generating xpaths, creating columns based on the element names and maintained a xpath to column name map. I did all of this using XSLT unfortunately I am not good at XSLT so got stuck when i couldnt convert xpath to an XML a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22353758generatingxmlfromxpathusingxsltas can be seen from my question on SOa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22382526xslttransformationinvbanotworkingthis oneap  pIn the strongsecondstrong approach i wanted to read the xml, create a table similar to the one below and again use the element names for column names. In this case too i would maintain a column name to xml mapping. I am currently working on this approach.p  precodeid  parent element 0     0     ltsoapenvelopgt 1     0     ltsoap headgt codepre  pThere is a strongthirdstrong approach where in i maintain a simple one to one relation between xml elements and column names and simply generate the xml on the fly. I am not yet sure how this approach will be implemented.p  pThe problem with the strongsecondstrong and strongthirdstrong approach is that, that i have not yet figured out how to handle attributes and namespacesnamespace urls.p  pMy final fall back would be to hard code the xml in the code and go with that. I would really not like to go with this approach.p  pI would prefer to have this solution be able to handle any kind of xml so that even when I am not around people can use it.p  pAs to where I need help, p  ol liDo you know of a better approach to do this Could your provide a code sample or pseudo codeli liCould you help me with the XSLT for the first approach If you can please a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22353758generatingxmlfromxpathusingxsltput your answer at my question about ita.li liFor the second and third approach do you know how i can handle attributes and namespaces  namespace url Could you provide code or pseudo codeli liI am desperate now...So any guidance will be helpful and a solution would be awesome.li ol  pThe question may seem too broad but I read about the a hrefhttpmeta.stackexchange.comquestions66377whatisthexyproblemXY problemaThanks to Mathias Muller and decided to describe what I want to do and the solutions I have in mind or worked on so that people reading this have all the information and can provide an answerp  pIf you still think this is too broad, please let me know and ill break up my solutions into separate questions.p  pLastly, this solution needs to work in excel VBA but should not deter Javagroovy experts because we can use a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5297341callingjavalibraryjarfromvbavbscriptvisualbasicclassica JAR in VBAa...Yes I am desperate.p

Negative 1301 pMy project has 5 pages 1 front page and 4 subpages. I have a popup that says touch to begin that shows on the front page. Im prefetching the 4 subpages with back buttons to go back to the front page. I have set up a timer that if the project is idle for X amount of time, load the front page. p  pI have set up a cookie that is created on the front page to keep track of whether a popup has been shown because I dont want the popup to show every time the user navigates to a subpage and back to the front. When the timer goes off and reloads to the front page, the cookie is deleted. p  pThe cookie creation and deletion works but when I navigate to a subpage and back to the front page, I still see the popup. If I refresh the page, the cookie is seen as existing and the popup does not show and is not cleared until the timer goes off, so the cookies work.

Negative 1301 pIm working on an application that allows users to edit documents spreadsheets and other docs live. p  pWhen editing the files, a keyup function is triggered with AJAX which autosends a post request to saveupdate the file.p  pWhat Id like to do, is add a notifications or someway of registeringlogging that the user has updated the file. That could then get put into somesort of a feed.p  pThe problem is, that because there are a so many AJAX requests it would be impractical to log the edit based on AJAX save requests.p  pWhat would be a good structure to handle thisp  pI was thinking of using some sort of timestamping method, and only log an edits if the previous timestamp is out of a certain range like 15mins or something.p  pDoes anyone have any experience with this kind of thing Im really not sure what the best solution would be.

Negative 1301 pIm creating a game where there is a split screen view for 2 players.p  pThe game is for an iPad and the the split screen will work in such way that each player will see the nodes rightsideup. The way that the app works is that the upper half of the game will have all nodes rotated upsidedown.p  pThe problem I have is that when the scene is being loaded, none of the actions are being executed before the scene is fully in view.p  pFor an instance, Im using the following command to rotate one of the labelsp  precode[self.player1Score runAction[SKAction rotateByAngleUPSIDEDOWN duration0]] codepre  pThe problem is that the rotation wont take place until the scene animation is done  which will make it look very strange as the nodes will rotate immediately once the scene is fully in view I could animate them, but I prefer they load up already rotated properly.p  pI tried running this from both stronginitWithSizestrong and strongdidMoveToViewstrong but the results were the same.p  pMy only option at the moment is for the Textures to be duplicated and rotated using Photoshop  but Id rather to have the app lighter and not have unnecessary graphics if I can help it.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1301 pIm still fairly new to iOS development. My app is currently able to display runtime userplaced pinsfor car dealerships in a view controller, however as soon as the user exits the app or even the current map view, the pins disappear.

Negative 1301 pIm reading up on device controllers and am rather confused about the following pointp  blockquote   pThe device controller informs the CPU that it has finished its   operation by causing an interruptp blockquote  pTo me, this seems to defy the intuitive notion of what an interrupt is, ie to to stop the continuous progress of an activity or process. Shouldnt the interrupt occur at the beginning or throughout the controllers execution, and then stop once the controller is finishedp  pFor example, if I send a command on my computer to print a document, Im imagining theres a message being sent from the printer to the PC to signal the end of its execution, but I certainly wouldnt think of it as an interrupt. If the IO device has finished execution, shouldnt that free up more resources to the OSp

So I cloned the second directory to the first directory location. and I realize the first directory has the second directory as the origin, and the second directory has the first directory as the origin. Before this mornings accident, when I pull or checkout in the first directory, it was referenced to itself, but now it is the second directory as the origin. and the second directory has the first directory as the origin. They are now cross gitting  p  pIm worried I may screw things up in this configuration of course I can copy whole directory to a third directory for safety. How can I make the first directory as the real origin and make second directory follow the first directory as beforep

Negative 1301 pIve been developing a console Chessgame in C using MVS2010 and I seem to have faced a problem I cannot solve on my own.

I emknowem Xcode can base a project off of whats in a repository, but Im not sure I should do that since what CMake does when it creates a project out of a repositorys contents is emprobablyem different from what Xcode does in such a situation.  Would it be safe for me to go ahead and just use only Xcodes builtin tools for communicating with remote repositories, or should I try and get CMake back into the loop somehow after Ive let Xcode do its thing  p

Negative 1301 pIm working on codeWeb Servicescode which authenticates users against codeActive Directorycode. My current solution is working, however, Im trying to take a different approach.p  pI have an codeActive Directorycode production which is sitting behind the firewall. I also installed an codeActive Directorycode in codeDMZcode. Theres a one way relationship between them. DMZ trusts production and production doesnt care about codeDMZcode. p  pWhat Im trying to accomplish is Authenticate everyone through codeDMZ Active Directorycode. Currently, based on the username I know which codeADcode server to authenticate against.p  pFor example, my production Active Directory let say domain strongdomain.localstrong and my DMZ Active directory let say domain strongdomain.publicstrong. Before I do authentication against any AD server, I check if the username provided exists in one of the server. Then, I check if the user is active and only then I do authentication. emIm having issues in the first function. It never reaches to the second or third functions.emp  pstrongUPDATE ADDED EVERYTHINGstrongp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Runtime.Serialization using System.ServiceModel using System.Text using System.DirectoryServices using System.Security.Principal using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement  namespace ActiveDirectory   NOTE You can use the Rename command on the Refactor menu to change the class name Service1 in both code and config file together. public class Service1  IService1      region Does User Exist in AD      public string local  string.Empty     public string ldappath  string.Empty     public string userNameToUse  string.Empty     public string domain  string.Empty      public bool DoesUserExiststring userName              string userName  userName          bool exist  true          using var domainContext  new PrincipalContextContextType.Domain, domain                      using var foundUser  UserPrincipal.FindByIdentitydomainContext, IdentityType.SamAccountName, userNameToUse                              if foundUser  null                                      exist  false                                  else                                      return exist                                                return exist           endregion      region Check if User Active     public bool isActive string userName              string userNameToBeSearched  userNameToUse         string username  string.Empty         string pwd  string.Empty          if local  YES                       username  xx              pwd  xx             ldappath  LDAPxxxDCxx, DClocal                  else                       username  xx              pwd  xx              ldappath  LDAPxxxDCxx, DCpublic                   bool isActive  true          try                      DirectoryEntry entry  new DirectoryEntryldappath, username, pwd             DirectorySearcher search  new DirectorySearcherentry             entry.AuthenticationType  AuthenticationTypes.Secure             search.SearchRoot  entry             search.Filter  SAMAccountName  userNameToBeSearched                SearchResult results  search.FindOne              if results.ToString                                int flags  Convert.ToInt32results.Properties[userAccountControl][0].ToString                  CHECK IF THE ACCOUNT IS DISABLED                 if flags  66050                                      isActive  false                                                catch DirectoryServicesCOMException ex                      ex.ToString                  return isActive           endregion      region Is user authenticated     public string isAuthenticated string userName, string pwd              string userName, pwd, message         userName  userName         pwd  pwd          char[] splitchar              string[] strSplit  userName.Splitsplitchar          string z  strSplit[0]          if strSplit.Length  2                      domain  x.public             userNameToUse  z.ToString             local  NO                  else                      domain  x.local             userNameToUse  z.ToString             local  YES                   if DoesUserExist userNameToUse  true                      if isActiveuserNameToUse  true                              try                                      DirectoryEntry entry  new DirectoryEntryldappath, userNameToUse, pwd                     object nativeObject  entry.NativeObject                     var GUIDID                        using var domainContext  new PrincipalContextContextType.Domain, domain                                              using var user  UserPrincipal.FindByIdentitydomainContext, IdentityType.SamAccountName, userNameToUse                                                      if user  null                                                              GUIDID  user.Guid.ToString                                                                               message  Successfully authenticated  GUIDID                                                       catch DirectoryServicesCOMException                                      message  Invalid password.                                           else                              message  Account is disabled                               else                      message  Theres an issue with your account.                  return message                 endregion   codepre  pIf username exists in codeDMZcode AD it will return true else it will return false.

Negative 1301 pI am calling codeaddTransactionObservercode in my AppDelegates didFinishLaunching method, and it immediately prompts the user to either log in to their iTunes account, or to input the password if they are already logged in. This happens to new users who have never installed the app before. If they input the password, nothing happens, and the app is fine, but they are then prompted for their password again when they want to buy something. Regardless, the app shouldnt be asking a user to log in to their iTunes account when all it has done is launch. p  pI know that there are issues that can arise from not calling codefinishTransactioncode where the transaction can get stuck in a weird state and prompt the user to log in until it is finished.

Negative 1301 pI have a question I have tried searching around but I cannot seem to find tutorials on it.p  pI am hoping to use a console application to delete files of a particular extension for example .zip files but omit the deletion of files with the same extension whose filenames are located in a text file.p  pExample of the contents in the text filep  pFolder1filename1.zip p  pFolder2filename2.zip  p  pFilename3.zipp  pFilename4.zipp  pEach filenames are written on a separate line in the text file. As you can see some of the zip files are in the root directory where the console application is in and some are in folders in the root directory.p  pI tried using My.computer.filesystem.getfiles and search all levels for .zip and then I was unable to continue as I am not sure how to delete all the zip files that are not found in the text file.p  pIt would be deeply grateful if someone can show me a sample code on how to make this work in a console application.p  pIf it is not too much trouble is it also possible to show a sample code for the reverse where only zip files whose filenames are in the text file are deleted.p  pI notice that when there are characters such as  and  in the file names and an illegal character error will be displayed each time I try to delete the file using My.computer.filesystem.deletefile if I remember the code correctly. I tried searching for tutorials but it did not work for me. If it is possible can the code sample shown address this problem as well. It would be good to also explain how it works if possible as I am curious to know how the code would work.

Negative 1301 pI have a UICollectionView where I overrode hitTestwithEvent in my UICollectionViewCells in order to allow for taps just outside of the cells to register as taps on the cells.p  pWhen I do this and I tap just outside the cells that now register as hits, I get calls to didHighlightItemAtIndexPath and didUnhighlightItemAtIndexPath, but I dont get a call to didSelectItemAtIndexPath. If I tap inside the cell I get all of the expected highlight and select item calls as I did before.p  pI dont have any custom gesture recognizers set up and I dont override touchesBegan or anything like that.p  pSo does anyone know under what conditions you get a call for didHighlightItemAtIndexPath without a call to didSelectItemAtIndexPath Is there any way to get my didSelectItemAtIndexPath called Thanks.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI forgot to mention that my UICollectionView is within a Today Widget, so it is contained within the Notification Center scroll view. If I move my select code into the didUnhighlightItemAtIndexPath, then it is called when you tap outside the cell, but the result is that you cant actually scroll the Notification Center without selecting one of the cells.p  pSo perhaps the difference between the highlighting and selecting that Im experiencing here has something to do with the scroll view responder canceling the selection outside of the cellp

Negative 1301 pI have too many forms, more than 60 i think, each form is a model from ModelForm, the user may be able to update the data the they fill, im doing it with an UpdateView for each form, i mean, one view for each form so i have too many views, maybe following the philosophy of django dont repeat yourself can i have just one view and one template for update all the forms p  pOperation is the followingp  pEach form is a model, and each form has an unique URL, so django has to detect which update form has to render depending of the pk pass it to the URL.

Although, it also finds codeNothingcode when the value that is strongdispayedstrong in a cell differs from the value in codeMincode variable. p  pFor instance, when codeMin  11.2641373534338code, the value in a cell is code11.264137code, and then error occurs.

Negative 1301 pI have a whole lot of REST webservices developed with CXF and managed in a spring application container, and I have been tasked with creating a servlet that will create a session object that will store attributes which will be read within the JaxRS services.p  pI have tried just adding a simple JEE servlet to collect the parameters and create the session object, but then I couldnt figure out how to inject that session object for use throughout the application. I have also tried adding springmvc and springweb to the application, and using a dispatcher servlet, which should make it easier to get the session object in each of the webservice beans. Adding two dependencies for a simple servlet seems like overkill, and moreover, springmvc doesnt seem to play nice with JaxRS, the rest path that I had all the services running on before seems to be taken over by springmvc jaxrs can no longer initialize endpoints on that path even though I am using a completely different path for the session servlet.p  precodeimport org.springframework.stereotype.Controller  import org.springframework.ui.ModelMap import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod  Controller RequestMappingsession public class SessionController   RequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.GET public String doGetModelMap model    return sessionPage    RequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.POST public String doPostModelMap model    return redirectmainpage     codepre  pAt the moment the frontend is in React.js, all interactions with the backend are through REST service calls.

Negative 1301 pI was not to sure how to frame the question in just the post title, so heres the full storyp  pIm working on a shopify theme and am a bit annoyed by the fact that I always have to save my CSS changes, switch the browser tab and hit reload to see what Ive done yes I did discover the theme gem which detects local changes and uploads them, but that doesnt give me reloading....p  pSo my plan was to come up with a Gulp task which does the followingp  ol lidetects changes to scss filesli licompiled them to cssli liinjects the changes using browser sync which proxies the shopify theme url to a localhost addressli ol  pThe trouble that Im facing now is that shopify uploads changed assets instantly to a cdn and loads them from there when previewing a theme. Since the css is included from a different domain, I guess that browser sync doesnt recognize that file anymore and one to overwrite with the changes to inject.p  pSo the remaining question is the followingp  pIf my theme preview url proxied to a local address like codehttplocalhost3000code loads the css file from something like codehttpscdn.shopify.comsfiles108787368t2assetsstyle.css12713062062911383123code, can I tell browser sync in gulp to overwrite exactly that file with the changes to injectp  pHope Im making sense here.p

Negative 1301 pI have a simple virtual machine which I made for fun. It works in a very low level and it doesnt have any notion of types. Everything is just an integer. There are some instructions for getting a pointer and accessing memory by a pointer. The problem is that these pointers are simply stored as codeuint64tcode, and any pointer arithmetic is an integer arithmetic. The machine casts this to a codevoidcode when using it as a pointer. Well, this kind of code is obvious in the assembly level, but the C and C standard doesnt let programmers do integerpointer cast safely, especially when the integer is used to change the value of the pointer.p  pIm not making this toy VM portable everywhere. It is just expected to work under x863264 machines, and it does seem to work very fine even after full compiler optimizations. I think its because pointers are represented no differently as integers in the x86 architecture.p  pWhat kind of solution is usually applied in such situations, that the language standards doesnt declare certain code as safe, but it really should be safe in the targeted hardware, and the results does seem okayp  pOr as a more practical question, how can I let a compiler gcc not perform breaking optimizations on code likep  precodeuint64t registers[0x100] registers[0]  uint64tmalloc8 registers[0]  4 registers[2]  0 memcpyampregisters[2], voidregisters[0], 4 codepre  pThe above isnt real code, but a certain sequence of bytecode instructions would actually do something similar as above.p

Negative 1301 pHow can I immediately abandon a longrunning computation in native code in C on Android when the user presses a Cancel button, without inserting cancellation checksp  pTo explain the constraintsp  ul liThis native code is too complex to insert sufficient cancellation checks or progress information[1], so the process must be forcibly killed.li liThe Android apps UI must remain running hence a separate process to let the user conveniently retry with different parameters.li liTheres no need to support more than one such computation at a time.li ul  pIm well aware that the general position on process lifecycle on Android is that you must let the platform manage it for you. Nonetheless, I want to get as close to the above requirement as possible with as few unsupported operations as possible.p  pI have a solution below but Im hoping theres a better one. For example if you split a service into an extra process using a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsmanifestserviceelement.htmlproc relnofollowandroidprocess in the manifesta, and one thread of that goes into a deep JNI call, is there a way to immediately kill such a process, or exit it from within, without causing the runtime to treat it as an unexpected crashp  hr  p[1] I have tried cancellation checks. Its over 70,000 SLOC 3.1 MB of C whose memory allocations and control flow are complex it was not written with interruptibility in mind. That way lies doublecodefreecode and inscrutable crashes in subsequent operation.p

Negative 1301 pIve looked all around for someone having a similar problem to me and cant find anything. Basically I am creating a real time multiplayer game with NodeJS, Socket.IO, Express, and Jade.p  pEverything so far is working great, but this is looking to be a relatively large game, and so Ive decided to use OOP concepts for it, but I cant figure out how to tie that in with Socket.IO.p  pLets say for example I have my main server file, well call this server.jsp  precodevar express  requireexpress var app  express var server  requirehttp.createServerapp var io  requiresocket.ioserver var port  process.env.PORT  4040  server.listenport, function      console.logServer listening on port d, port   app.setviews, dirname  client app.setview engine, jade app.enginejade, requirejade.express Have a custom routing setup, works fine. app.get, routes.index  The client refers to where the views and css and everything is located app.useexpress.staticdirname  client  io.onconnection, function socket      socket.on ...  codepre  pNow that all works fine, but lets say I introduce a player class, well call player.jsp  precodevar name    function player name      this.name  name   player.prototype.getName  function       return this.name   module.exports  player codepre  pThen import that to the server.js class like sop  precodevar player  require.player.js codepre  pEverything is still working fine to here. I can create new player objects and call their functions.p  pWhere Im stuck is using Socket.IO outside of the main server.js file.p  pAs far as I can tell, all of my socket.on or socket.emit calls need to be within the io.onconnection because thats where the socket is created.p  pThe only thing Ive seen close to this is using socket.io namespaces, which doesnt really seem to solve my problem because things still have to be in their own io.onconnection.p  pIve seen socketioemitter as well, but I certainly will need to listen for socket.on calls and not just emit things.p  pIt seems like there should be a way to use this in a more global scope.p

Negative 1301 pI am using Java and Android Studio.  I need to change an image on the actionbar.  What I need to do is to change the image I am displaying on the actionbar based on a reading received from a remote  sensor. Therefore, I cannot use a clickable method but instead I have  some code that activates when the data is received from the sensor.  The code then analyzes the data and decides which of several images to display.  The program then needs to update the actionbar image.  This is the part I need your help on.  I think I should use onPrepareOptionsMenu to update the image.  However, I cannot seem to get the code correct to call onPrepareOptionsMenu.  In particular, onPrepareOptions uses parameters Menu menu.  I cannot seem to specify the second menu properly as it always gives an error.  The code below gives required android.view.Menu found int.  If I initialize menu with null I get a null reference error.  Any suggestions how to correct my code or maybe do something totally different to be able to update the image  Thanks.

Negative 1301 pIm really new to using javascript and working with html so please forgive the noobness, if thats even a word. So, I used Adobe createJS toolkit to display graphics exportRootTitle while a load bar shows progress of the preloadJS. I have a handleComplete function which then removes exportRootTitle from the stage and adds another exportRoot which is the main content.p  pMy problem is I need to have two separate resize functions, one on init and one on the handleComplete function. I tried having two listeners like thisp  precodewindow.addEventListenerresize, resizeTitle, false window.addEventListenerresize, resizeMain, false codepre  pIt doesnt seem to work. So I was thinking maybe there is a way to make the resize function conditional maybe by using ifelse. Maybe something like if handleComplete is fired, the resize function will be for exportRoot but if not yet, its for exportRootTitle, or something like that.

Negative 1301 pI am just beginning the exciting journey towards learning Javascript, and in one of my lessons I am being asked to build a voidLastTransaction method to add to my virtual cash register. I have written out the code, which allows the user to void the amount from the last transaction. However, I would like to know how to do it to void the last two transactions, rather than one. I suppose calling the function after each transaction I want voided is one way of doing it but I am wondering if there is a more dynamic way of resetting the property that stores the amount of the last transaction so that it changes to the value of the previous transaction on the list, which would become the next last transaction once the last transaction has been deducted.

Negative 1301 pI am currently using  jQuery sortable to rearrange table rows in my application. I have this all working fine except I need to introduce functionality where dragging is only enabled when the user selects a team from a dropdown box on the page. The idea is that when the user first arrives onto the view, a list of team rows will be displayed. They user can select a unique team from the dropdown and filter all the rows associated with that particular team. This is when I want to be able to enable the sortable functionality. I am using the sortable library in an Angular directive, and I am filtering all table rows in the Angular controller. If someone could please point me in the right direction I would be extremely grateful.

If I delete or move the picture from that path it wont be shown when starting the exe.p  pHow can I include the picture to the exe I want to have only one file in the end ...p
Negative 1301 pHow would one go about using replace in netbeans to modify a PHP script with lots of POST[]p  pFor better security it would be a good idea to replace all these POST[] with sanitizePOST[] where sanitize is a function that sanitizes user input.p  pSo I could use Replace and search for POST[] and replace with sanitizePOST[]p  pBut how do you keep the variable name within each POST[] while adding the closing parenthesisp  pFor example POST[name] and POST[action] need to become sanitizePOST[name] and santizePOST[action] respectively.p

Negative 1301 pRecently, my Android project is being told that it does not use the Gradle build system. Also, for some reason, the only folder listed within my project is the java folder, which contains R, the buildconfig, and the autogenerated manifest used by the IDE, but it doesnt contain the actual app files, located in the app folder. The app folder exists, but is not listed in the app. Furthermore, I am unable to drag and drop the folder into the hierarchy listed in Android Studio. Also, theres a build.gradle that isnt listed. p  pThe app built fine before, and the only change I can tell is that I have pushed a newer version to Github after importing the entire thing from Eclipse. It built fine with the gradle build system after importing from Eclipse. I have just tried to commit the build.gradle into the app, which was unversioned before. The problem is that the project still claims to not use the gradle build system.p
