Positive 2167 pI am monitoring a Java app through VisualVM and I can see that the heap memory stays relatively constant, however the Java process grows larger and larger in memory. p  pI understand that the Java memory consists of heap memory and the JVMPermGen memory which involves all sort of things, but my java app is a GUI application and this supposed memory leak only happens if the GUI component are in a specific configuration.p  pI have done some research and apparently it is possible to get memory leak while staying within the heap size. What I dont understand is how my situation could be such a scenario.p  pAny idea how Swing manipulations might cause such a memory leakp
Positive 2167 pAt work Ive suffered from quite a few memory leaks in a Silverlight 5 project so I thought Id run an idea by you for resolving this issue.p  pThe idea stems from implementing a Dispose pattern across all view models. One area in particular I think is a major headache as far as memory leaks are concerned are events, and therefore I believe this solution should address this nicely.p  pThe way I think about it is that this should allow 1 and only one subscriber to subscribe to events at a time. Meaning that the same object shouldnt be able to subscribe for the same event twice and having the subsequent side effects.p  pSecond, since I keep a reference to the subscribers of the event  when dispose comes around I can get rid of those references, regardless of the fact that the EventHandler internally keeps the same references. I get a chance to unhook the event completely by unhooking all of its subscribers and thus preventing the pesky memory leaks.p  pDoes anyone think this will introduce issues in the app I mean its rather large and I dont want to push experimental stuff without researching a bit more.p  pThanksp  pStart with the codeDisposableObjectcode base classp  precodepublic class DisposableObject  IDisposable    private bool disposed  false  to detect redundant calls     ltsummarygt    Default constructor    ltsummarygt   public DisposableObject       ltsummarygt    Object that inherit from this base class should override this method instead,    since its called from the Dispose method by the base.    ltsummarygt    ltparam namedisposinggtltparamgt   protected virtual void Disposebool disposing        if disposed            if disposing                 disposeonly, i.e. nonfinalizable logic                shared cleanup logic       disposed  true             ltsummarygt    Destructor    ltsummarygt   DisposableObject        Disposefalse        ltsummarygt    Implementation of IDisposable.

I believe this is the only place that these constructors are being kept, but Im not 100 sure how to go about proving this my code base is very, very large.p  pBy using the garbage collection button in Chrome Development Tools it will actually clean up some of the constructors, but a vast proportion of them remain. How can I force the ComponentManager to delete these constructorsp

Positive 2167 pI am currently looking for a way around an apparent memory leak in the Mac implementation of the REST client. The code to generate the memory leak is the following running XE8, update 1p  precodeprogram macRESTleaktest APPTYPE CONSOLE R .res  uses   System.SysUtils, REST.Client, REST.Types, IPPeerClient  var    request  TRestRequest    ii, iMax  integer begin    iMax  1     for ii  0 to iMax do    begin       request  TRestRequest.Createnil        Fake Online REST API for Testing and Prototyping        request.Client  TRestClient.Createhttpjsonplaceholder.typicode.com       request.Method  rmPOST       request.Execute        request.Client.Free       request.Free    end end. codepre  pThis is the smallest block of code that demonstrates the leak. Essentially, I have a synching service that makes REST requests every so often.p  pWhen I run this on Windows, using MadExcept, no leaks are found. Examining the running process in ProcessMonitor shows no increase in the amount of memory being used.p  pWhen run on a Mac, however, the Activity Monitor shows the memory allocated to the app continue to rise. Further, when run using Instruments, there appear to be leaks dealing with several URL and HTTP classes on mac.p  pDoes anybody know how to resolve this leak p  pAs an aside, it would be really helpful to know exactly where the leak is coming from on Mac, but the only Delphi classes listed are the TMethodImplementationIntercept. Im to believe that this is due to the fact that Delphi doesnt generate a dSYM file for Mac. If anybody knows a way around that, that would be awesome toop  pstrongUPDATEstrong By varying codeiMaxcode from 1 to 10 and comparing the FastMM4 output, it appears that the leak is in the class codeMacapi.ObjectiveC.TConvObjID.XFormcode. The 10 iteration output contains 9 more leaks with this as a stack trace compared to the 1 iteration. I have reported this to Embarcadero as RSP12242.p
Positive 2167 pIm developing a simple game in Java just to use as a toy program to teach some techniques for my students, but Im having some problem. My game uses two ArrayList that are iterated lots of times. These lists contains the projectiles that a ship fire and the targets that these projectiles can destroy. I need to constantly verify the colision between each projectile with each target in the screen among other things related to iterating throught these lists. I noted that while my program was running, the performance of it started to get worse and worse, so I started to profile the project Im using NetBeans profiler to find problems.p  pOne thing that I find is that using the for each of Java to iterate throught the lists implies calling iterator method inplicitly a lot of memory started to be used and not released.p  pI wrote the code below to test this.

Positive 2167 pIm starting out in C and using memcheck to check my programs for memory leaks. p  pIf when... there are leaks, I get the codeUnfreed memory allocations remainingcode output, which the uses of codenewcode, codemalloccode etc which havent been freed. These are typically accompanied by the source file and line number of the allocation, which makes it easy to fix.p  pSometimes though the source module is listed as codeunknown line0code, for calls to codenewcode in my case. If memcheck knows a call to codenewcode has been made, how is it that it cant tell where this has come from Im just trying to get my head around this so I can have some idea where these leaks might be coming from.p
Positive 2167 pIm working on tracking down a memory leak in my C app. p  pMy first way of going about this was to start a background worker which prints out the result of codeGC.GetTotalMemorycode every 10 seconds to the console. p  pMy leak takes some time to appear, so next I downloaded CLR Profiler. After the console showed I was constantly up around 3040 MB, I hit Show heap now.

Positive 2167 pMy application uses both RMI and JDBC to talk to a remote system and a database.  While the database issues have been resolved, it turns out that RMI is causing some form of Memory Leak being detected by Tomcat 6 I have also tried this with Tomcat 7 and we have the same issue.p  pBasically, when we start the application and the user enters information into the webpage, an RMI call is made to a backend system.  If we stopstart or restart the application, Tomcat Manager now can detect a memory leak.  If we start the application and do NOT make the RMI call, we can startstop amp restart the application all day long without issues.p  pDoes anyone know what needs to be done to prevent RMI calls from causing Memory Leaks in the WebappClassLoader upon reload or stopstart while the webserver is still runningp
Positive 2167 pIve been doing development on a Cordova application that requires YouTube embed codeiframescode to frequently be created, then subsequently destroyed when the user leaves that view. Weve found that it only takes around 40 codeiframecode loads and destroys for the application to crash due to memory shortage on an iPhone 4S 512 MB of RAM.p  pIve been investigating this, and it seems even iOS Safari exhibits this behaviour. If I do the same addition and removal of a YouTube embed codeiframecode a couple dozen times, eventually I get a memory warning and sometimes page reload. Heres a graph of the free memory over time via Instruments, note the flag at the end signifying the low memory warningp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comHdFrH.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHdFrH.png altInstruments Profilingap  pA YouTube embed obviously is a more challenging example, but Ive even replicated this with a Wikipedia codeiframecode, so dont think its domainspecific.p  pSo far Ive been removing the codeiframecode with codejQuery.removecode, but obviously theres some memory usage that remains after the removal. Is there a more complete way to remove the codeiframecode and any associated data in memoryp  pIve also tried clearing some of the codeiframecode properties before removal, like sop  precodevar myIframe  iframe[srchttpswww.youtube.com] myIframe[0].src  aboutblank myIframe[0].contentWindow.close myIframe.remove codepre  pBut the memory still isnt being properly freed up.p  pSame process on Chrome for Android doesnt exhibit this. Safari and Chrome on OS X seem ok, Firefox on OS X seems to be performing badly, but thats a bit offtopic.p  pSeems like a bug, codeltembedgtcode and codeltobjectgtcode also display this issue, so only fix might be via a bug report with Apple.p

Negative 2167 pIve got a strange bug that Im hoping a more experience programmer might have some insight into. Im using the boost ublas sparse matrices, specifically mappedmatrix, and there is an intermittent bug that occurs eventually, but not in the initial phases of the program. This is a large program, so I cannot post all the code but the core idea is that I call a function which belongs to a particular classp  precodebool MyClassgetcellunsigned int i, unsigned int j const      return ci,j  codepre  pThe variable c is defined as a member of the classp  precodeboostnumericublasmappedmatrixltboolgt c codepre  pWhen the bug occurs, the program seems to stop but does not crash. Debugging with Eclipse, I can see that the program enters the boost mappedmatrix code and continues several levels down into stdmap, stdRbtree, and stdless.  Also, the program occasionally traces down to stdmap, stdRbtree, and stdSelect1st. While code is executing and the active line  whats in memory changes in Rbtree, execution never seems to return in the level of stdmap. The line in stdmap the program is stuck on is the return of the following function.p  precodeconstiterator findconst keytypeamp x const  return Mt.findx  codepre  pIt seems to me that there is some element in the c matrix that the program is looking for but somehow the underlying storage mechanism has misplaced it. However, Im not sure why or how to fix it. That could also be completely off base.p  pAny help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. If I have not included the right information in this question, please let me know what Im missing. Thank you.p

Negative 2167 pI need to ask someone for a big favor. What you see in the code below are my calculations for train movement for a train game I am writing. There is a problem with the calculations, but I just cant seem to find it. The problem seems to be located in this codep  precode      iftrainRow[direction]            trackUnitCount  routeData[trackunitcount]  trackUnitCount        codepre  pI will explain the exact problem in more depth later, but for now, Id like to explain the train movement logic the game may be found at a hrefhttpapps.facebook.comrails5Facross5Feurope relnofollowhttpapps.facebook.comrails5Facross5Feuropeap  pThe game board consists of a map of Europe containing cities. Cities are connected by routes. Routes have a starting city and an ending city. Routes are connected by track which is divided into track units. Each route has a given number of track units. A train may travel a route in either a positive  or negative  direction. If the city the train started at is the routes starting city, then the train is traveling in a positive direction. If the trains starting city is the routes ending city, then the direction is negative. p  pA train starts in a city and the user chooses a destination city to travel to. The train has a given number of track units it may travel in a single turn. If the train does not have enough track units to reach the destination city in a single turn, then the trains status is set to ENROUTE and the trains current track unit is set to the track unit the train stopped on. The trains remaining track units is zero since the train used all its track units. If the train has more than enough track units to reach the destination, then the train stops at the destination and the trains status is set to ARRIVED. The trains remaining track units is set to the trains starting track units minus the number of track units used to reach its destination. p  pThe players turn will not end until his trains remaining track units reach zero, so once the player has finished his business at the current city, he will choose another city destination and the train will move its remaining track units toward that city. If the train has more than enough track units remaining to reach that city, then it stops at the city and the track units traveled are subtracted from its remaining track units. This goes on until the remaining track units reach zero.p  pThe problem is that this code sets trackUnitCount to zero, which then in turn sets the trains current track unit to zero, which indicates that the train has arrived at its destination city which is incorrect. This results in the train hopping from one city to another without running out of track units remaining which should end the players turn before he arrived at the destination cityp  pIf you can help me out with this, you are truly a cybersaint p  precode  public function moveTraindestCityId      requireonce Train.php     trainModel  new Train      requireonce Route.php     routeModel  new Route      userNamespace  new ZendSessionNamespaceUser     gamePlayerId  userNamespacegtgamePlayerId      trainData  trainModelgtgetTraingamePlayerId      ifdestCityId  trainData[destcityid]        originCityId  trainData[origincityid]      else        originCityId  trainData[destcityid]          routeId  routeModelgtgetRouteIdByCityIdsoriginCityId, destCityId     trainRow  array     ifrouteId  null        routeData  routeModelgtgetRouteByCityIdsoriginCityId, destCityId       trainRow[direction]  routeModelgtgetRouteTravelDirectionoriginCityId, destCityId        routeData[trackunitcount] are the total number of track units in this route       trainData[trackunit] is the track unit the train is currently stopped on       trackUnitCount  routeData[trackunitcount]  trainData[trackunit] 633       trainData[trackunitsremaining] are the number of track units the train has left to move       trackUnitsRemaining  trainData[trackunitsremaining]  trackUnitCount 532       iftrackUnitsRemaining gt 0          trackUnitsTraveled  trackUnitCount 2        else          trackUnitsTraveled  trainData[trackunitsremaining]         trackUnitsRemaining  0              trainRow  trainData        trainRow[routeid]  routeId       trainRow[origincityid]  originCityId       trainRow[destcityid]  destCityId        iftrainRow[direction]            trainRowTrackUnit  trackUnitsTraveled  trainData[trackunit] 235        else          trainRowTrackUnit  routeData[trackunitcount]  trainData[trackunitsremaining]         iftrainRowTrackUnit lt 0 trainRowTrackUnit  0              trainRow[trackunit]  trainRowTrackUnit 5       trainRow[trackunitsremaining]  trackUnitsRemaining 2       trainArrived  trainRowTrackUnit  0  trainRowTrackUnit  routeData[trackunitcount]       trainRow[status]  trainArrived  true  ARRIVED  ENROUTE        trainId  trainModelgtgetTrainIdgamePlayerId       where  trainModelgtgetAdaptergtquoteIntoid  , trainId       trainModelgtupdatetrainRow, where          return trainRow    codepre

Negative 2167 pOK, so Im trying to use S4 classes to build a very complex object, with slots including a halfdozen matrices, a few lists, and probably a kitchen sink or two in there. The object is initialized by referring to and unpacking a configuration object which Ive already defined. Its easy enough to define the class with setClass, but Im having difficulty figuring out an elegant way of setting the slots in the setMethodinitialize. p  pThe problem is that I need to set particular elements of those halfdozen matrices based on parts of that configuration object. For each element of the configuration object, I may have to set specific elements of several of the matrices. Note that the matrices are in the scopeenvironment of the initialize function. I then have nested functions within the initialize function that do the actual assignment to the matrices, or thats the idea anyway. Those functions can of course emseeem the matrices, but they cant emmodifyem them because the lt operator creates a new matrix if the original variable was not defined in the current environment. R is passbyvalue, and means it. This is even true for slots of the .Object Im trying to initialize. So I cant use nested functions to do the initialization.p  pUnfortunately, these nested functions have to modify several of the matrices, so returning values and doing the assignment in the main initialize function is not practical or elegant. But it is possible, if I stuffed copies of the matrices into returned lists and then combined them in the main initialize function. Ugly though, and would require a lot of extra code.p  pAnd iteration which would prevent this scoping issue is not very practical either because of the hierarchical nature of the configuration object, which really wants to be traversed with recursive calls.p  pThe last option I can think of would be to use the assign function with the envir option to force the assignment to apply to the nonlocal variable. But using environments like that seems icky, like a goto statement... p  pSo, what is the most piratical approach Stick with pure functional programming and build ugly data structures just to inefficiently pass around redundant matrices Try to find an iterative solution that avoids functions altogether Use deep magic by playing with environmentsp

When I look in the apache logs, during the times I receive the error, the client is requesting codeA.jscode, before requesting codeB.jscode, and the server is responding with a code304code Not Modifiedp  pI somehow suspect the issue is that the file has expired from the client cache however the server doesnt send the file thus it is never executed and codeAcode is undefined. But thats just a guess and I dont understand why that would happen. And if I am guessing right, how do I fix itp  pIf it matters, codemoddiskcachecode was enabled on the server, and I have disabled it to see if that was causing the problem.

Negative 2167 pI am new to embedded devices programing.   I have a task that reads a block of data from  the DSP memory address and copies it to other addresses where other peripherals are mapped. the copying process is done by programming one of the DMA channels in the device. I would like, to have a copy of that data copied elsewhere in addition for the first copy.  p  pnow my question is, if I use a second DMA channel and trigger its copy operation on right after the first DMA start doing its job,   would the two DMA operations collide with each other in some way p
Negative 2167 pI have two classes a base class, FooBase and a derived class, codeFooBaseSubcode.  I want to have codeFooBaseSubcode do some type and data checking on the constructors argumenta hashbefore blessing it.  Ive tried overriding codeFooBasenewcodes constructor, doing the checks and then calling codeFooBasenewcode since the code would be exactly the samep  precodepackage FooBaseSub  sub new      ...check arguments type and data...     FooBasegtnewmyhash  codepre  pThe problem is that by calling codeFooBasecodes constructor, the hash will now be blessed as a FooBase object and not a FooBaseSub object.  The obvious solution is simply to put the code from codeFooBasenewcode into codeFooBaseSubnewcode but then Im repeating code.  The other thing is that FooBase is not minethus Id like to avoid having to modify it after the module has loaded or forking it unnecessarily. p  pIt seems to me that this problem must have come up before and so there must be a canonical solution.  Moreover, it really touches on type coercion which is generally not an issue Perl.   p  pSo is there a simple modification or am I going about this the wrong wayp

Negative 2167 pI have an Asp.net MVC project that modestly uses jQuery scripts. My views also display partial views in them, either returned using codeRenderPartialcode or codeRenderActioncode helper methods. Partial views are usually used to encapsulate some common display but they may as well have some clientside script functionality. My javascripts have the same names as views to which they are related.p  pSo if I have a partial view codeUserInformation.ascxcode I have a matching codeUserInformation.jscode file. Most of these script files register functionality for DOM ready event so they wont be executed immediately.p  pThe problem is, that these scripts are added to parent views. So if a certain view uses my partial view it also needs to add its matching script file. So if someone forgets to add the script to main view, my partial view functionality wont work.p  pIn terms of browser execution and speed or any other issues is it better to include all scripts in XHTML head element or is it irrelevant if Id reference these scripts inside my partial views This way I could avoid human error of forgetting to add the script to the view I could get a problem of referencing the same script file multiple times though. Especially if the same partial is used several times on the same view.p  pstrongAre there any differences when we reference scripts inside HEAD or BODY elementsstrongbr Are there any doctype related issues Im using XHTML Transitionalbr What is the most common patternp  pemIt would be nice to have some sort of script registration functionality in Asp.net MVC that would prevent me from loading the same script file multiple times...emp

Negative 2167 pAtomikos is quite verbose when used. There seems to be lots of INFO messages mostly irrelevant for me that the transaction manager writes out to the console. The setting in the transaction.properties that is suppose to control the level of messaging bcom.atomikos.icatch.consoleloglevelb does not seem to have any effect, since even when set to WARN or ERROR the INFO messages are still logged. Also the log4j settings for com.atomikos and atomikos seem to be ignored.  Does anyone manage to turn off the INFO logs on the console with Atomikos. How Thanksp  pPeterp

I also do not have any change tracking no snapshotbased tracking, no proxy classes.p  pI am under the impression this is where the smarts happen.p  pAt the moment, i am exploring a delegate option.

I then subscribe to this event in my Post Repository, where i plan to add the related entities to the other repositories.p  pThis should work.

Is this really possible p  pThe other thing I would like to know is  how does Javascript code generated by GWT fire RPC calls We used Wireshark to sniff requests and responses from client to SSLenabled web server, and there are none of the RPC packages going around. All we see are these TLS protocol packets, we can easily identify them by using filter on source and destination IP addresses of client and web server.p

Negative 2167 pI have a Visual Studio solution which consists of a DLL and an EXE. My program sets a global codeWHCALLWNDPROCcode hook. The hook procedure is defined by the DLL. I have verified that the DLL gets properly injected into all the processes I am interested in. The DLL exports a few procedures, which are defined in a header file, not in a DEF file. The EXE automatically loads the DLL and calls a method in the DLL to set the hook. When the DLL is loaded, codeDllMaincode sets an internal codeHMODULEcode variable which contains the DLLs module handle. When the EXE calls the codeinstallHookcode procedure, the DLL sets the hook. All this works fine.p  pWhen my hook procedure receives a codeWMSIZINGcode message, it executes another internal procedure, which is supposed to use GDI to draw something on the windows client codeDCcode. Using standard GDI works. However, GDI which I need to use does not work the codeGraphicsGraphicsHDCcode constructor causes the any program to crash as soon as I try to resize the window. Here is a snippet of the code that causes the crashp  precodevoid myFaultyProcedureHWND hWnd      RECT wndRect     GetWindowRecthWnd,ampwndRect     unsigned int wndWidthwndRect.rightwndRect.left     unsigned int wndHeightwndRect.bottomwndRect.top     HDC hDc     PAINTSTRUCT ps     ULONGPTR gdiplusToken     GdiplusStartupInput gdiplusStartupInput     GdiplusStartupampgdiplusToken,ampgdiplusStartupInput,NULL     hDcBeginPainthWnd,ampps     Graphics graphicshDc  I think that this causes the program to crash     delete ampgraphics     EndPainthWnd,ampps     ReleaseDChWnd,hDc     GdiplusShutdowngdiplusToken  codepre  pThe code calculates the width and height of a given window, gets a DC, starts GDI, creates a Graphics object, deletes the Graphics object, releases the DC, and shuts down GDI.

If I just want to not use it what would be the most efficient way to go about itp  pSpecifically, if you need to provide a codeFILE code to a function, but you want it to be discarded how would you go about itp  pAlso, as Im writing this I realised that maybe I shouldnt pass codeNULLcode to codeCURLOPTWRITEFUNCTIONcode, and instead write a function which does nothing Thanksp

Negative 2167 pI am looking to update an application in which I have the ability to update synchronously or asynchronously. For the realtime nature of the app, which currently ranges from a synchronous execution of methods ranging in frequencies from 160Hz, do you see any advantages into asynchronously updating due to user input Or should I wait until the next synchronous cycle to incorporate the changep  pMy thoughts so farp  pThe current advantage that I see with introducing an asynchronous update is that if a member in a 1Hz method is updated, the 60Hz method may execute 50 times with the old value. I know this is still a relatively short amount of time to a user  lt 1 second, but to me the principal of continuing calcs with bad values for 50 reps seems bad. p  pThe current advantage that I see with keeping it synchronous is the ease of readability for the flow of code execution. p  pAre there any repercussions I am not thinking ofp

So it is not bound by any controllers in IB.p  pThe tableview has 2 columns that have subclassed dataCells set.p  precodeNSTableColumn detailsColumn  [[tableView tableColumns] objectAtIndex0] imageColumnCell fileDetails  [[[imageColumnCell alloc] init] autorelease] [detailsColumn setDataCellfileDetails] [fileDetails setNumberOfUploadsnumberOfFiles]  NSTableColumn cancelColumn  [[tableView tableColumns] objectAtIndex1] cancelButtonCell cancelCell  [[[cancelButtonCell alloc] init] autorelease] [cancelColumn setDataCellcancelCell] codepre  pIn the codeltNSTableViewDataSourcegtcode file, codenumberOfRowsInTableViewcode is set to the correct count of the dynamically created array, and GDB logs it correctly when the table is drawn. p  pNow the problem comes in. For hypothetic reasons, lets say the array count for the datasource is strong1strongp  pIn both of the subclassed codeNSCellcodes I have overwritten the codedrawInteriorWithFrameinViewcode method to handle all the drawing images, text, buttons etc inside the table cells. The codeNSDictionarycode for each column contains a string column 1, and an object reference for column 2.p  pBased on the example of 1 object in the datasource, if in codedrawInteriorWithFrameinViewcode I were to write the following in column 2  p  precodeNSLogdrawInteriorWithFrame in cancelButtonCell  , [self objectValue] codepre  pThe expected result without clicking on the table or scrolling etc in GDB should be 1 instances of thisp  precode[0000000] drawInteriorWithFrame in cancelButtonCell  ltobject 0x123456gt codepre  pAnd if I were to click or scroll in the table, then it should return the same values for each action within the tableview. However, on first load I get something like thisp  precode[0000000] drawInteriorWithFrame in cancelButtonCell  ltobject 0x123af06gt [0000000] drawInteriorWithFrame in cancelButtonCell  ltobject 0x12b3236gt codepre  pIf there are 2 results, then I get 3 log items, and other times 4. In most cases, the method is called 1 more time than it should be. p  pThe second problem, that has only just recently cropped up, is that if you notice the object IDs above, you will see that they are different. If I add 1 item to the datasource, when I call code[self objectValue]code, if the table is redrawn, the object IDs should be the same, as it is a reference  ie. the object is already codealloccoded in the previous class, and I am merely sending the object reference.p  pI hope this makes sense, but I have been beating my head for the last day trying to see if I am mistakenly duplicating anything anywhere and cannot find any problems. If you need more code let me know. I have tried Google too and have only got reference to thisp  pa hrefhttpforum.soft32.commacNSPopUpButtonCellviewrefreshftopict46690.html relnofollowhttpforum.soft32.commacNSPopUpButtonCellviewrefreshftopict46690.htmlap  pThanks in advance.p  precode idtableViewNSTableView tableView objectValueForTableColumnNSTableColumn tableColumn rowNSIntegerrow     NSString columnIdentifier  [tableColumn identifier]    NSDictionary theDict  [fileSourceArray objectAtIndexrow]    MyAppMethods appMethods  [MyAppMethods alloc]   if[appMethods getIsCompleteself]     return nil    if[columnIdentifier isEqualToStringfileCancel]     if[[theDict objectForKeycolumnIdentifier] isKindOfClass[ASIFormDataRequest class]]       ASIFormDataRequest fileUploadRequest  [theDict objectForKeycolumnIdentifier]       NSLogin tableViewobjectValueForTableColumnrow , fileUploadRequest       return fileUploadRequest           return [theDict objectForKeycolumnIdentifier]  codepre  pAdditional output for discussion below.p  h3Output from GDBh3  p 1 file, 1 NSCell set and subclassed  emHere the request stays the same  i.e. no copyingemp  precode[6619903] ltASIFormDataRequest 0x10ca9b0gt [6619903]  idtableViewobjectValueForTableColumnrow UsersbyronrodeDesktopMonika and LuboDSC3379.jpg [6619903] imageColumnCell.m in  voiddrawInteriorWithFrameinView UsersbyronrodeDesktopMonika and LuboDSC3379.jpg [6619903]  idtableViewobjectValueForTableColumnrow ltASIFormDataRequest 0x10ca9b0gt [6619903]  idtableViewobjectValueForTableColumnrow UsersbyronrodeDesktopMonika and LuboDSC3379.jpg [6619903] imageColumnCell.m in  voiddrawInteriorWithFrameinView UsersbyronrodeDesktopMonika and LuboDSC3379.jpg [6619903]  idtableViewobjectValueForTableColumnrow ltASIFormDataRequest 0x10ca9b0gt codepre  h31 file, 2 NSCells set and subclassedh3  pemHere the request changes in the subclass  i.e. no copyingemp  precode[6652903] ltASIFormDataRequest 0x103b390gt [6652903]  idtableViewobjectValueForTableColumnrow UsersbyronrodeDesktopMonika and LuboDSC3379.jpg [6652903] imageColumnCell.m in  voiddrawInteriorWithFrameinView UsersbyronrodeDesktopMonika and LuboDSC3379.jpg [6652903]  idtableViewobjectValueForTableColumnrow ltASIFormDataRequest 0x103b390gt [6652903] cancelButtonCell.m in  voiddrawInteriorWithFrameinView ltASIFormDataRequest 0x1221b00gt [6652903]  idtableViewobjectValueForTableColumnrow UsersbyronrodeDesktopMonika and LuboDSC3379.jpg [6652903] imageColumnCell.m in  voiddrawInteriorWithFrameinView UsersbyronrodeDesktopMonika and LuboDSC3379.jpg [6652903]  idtableViewobjectValueForTableColumnrow ltASIFormDataRequest 0x103b390gt [6652903] cancelButtonCell.m in  voiddrawInteriorWithFrameinView ltASIFormDataRequest 0x1227100gt codepre

If I replace define constants with class constants, this problem is fixed, because in other classes I must use MyClassName before the constant name. But how can I minimize the object allocation for this simple task Someone have a better practice for this p  pstrongEDITstrong The code below is what I wanted to do, but its a little bit unconfortable to get the values of the enum or define. Because I created an application what have just an input where I can write the string to get that hash and go back to xcode and set the values for the enums. So my problem is I cant do that in runtime time, because of the main behavour of switch case statement...

Negative 2167 pIm starting a new Java EE 6 project using Netbeans 7, Maven 3 and JBoss 6. In past projects, I have been using Glasshfish 3. Deployment worked quite well with glassfish, automatically exploding a war and deploying it, so dynamic files xhtml was updated instantly.p  pIs it possible to achieve this using JBoss 6 Default behaviour seem to be a normal package and deploy a WARfile. Im guessing that i need Maven to do it completely by itself, but Im lacking quite alot of knowledge in that area. Can anyone help me out with configuring Maven to accomplish this automatically, or is it possible to do with netbeans settings only My intended result is to be able to save .xhtml files directly in netbeans and see the result instantly.p

Negative 2167 pIm writing a GUI that lets the user draw a graph, where each node is represented by an extended jlabel, and each arrow should be represented by an extended Jpanel with transparent background setOpaquefalse, but I noticed that only the first arrow panel is drawn or is at least visible, while the others arent shown. moreover, nodes added after this first arrow arent painted correctly they get painted only when I pass with the mouse on them. all the elements are added to a JPanel with null layout manager.

Negative 2167 pstrongEDIT with my own comment afterwardsstrongp  blockquote   pemI think the problem is that when PHP is parsing the file to compile, first it translates class names to their fully qualified   name.

Negative 2167 pI built an app in php where a feature analyzes about 10000 text files and extracts stuff from them and puts it into a mysql database.

The file analysis is a cron job and a single php file does all this processing.p  pThe problem however is that the app was built initially entirely on a shared server everything worked seamlessly really well. I didnt notice any delays or major lags neither did users however in order for it to be able to handle more of a load, I moved everything to an EC2 server the micro instance. p  pThe problem I am having now is that every time I run the cronjob process the files on hourly basis it slows the entire server down so much that a normal page takes about 58 seconds to load, which sort of defeats the purpose of moving it to EC2.p  pThe cron itself is a very long process.

Negative 2167 pI have a DirectShow Transform filter written in Delphi 6 using the DSPACK component library.  It is a simple audio mixer that creates a new input pin whenever a new connection is attempted.  I say simple because once its media format is set, all connections to the its input pins or singular output pin are forced to conform to that media format.  I build the filter chain manually, making all pin connections explicitly myself.  I do not use any of the intelligent rendering calls, unless there is some way to trigger that unwanted behavior in my case accidentally.p  pemNOTE The Capture Filter is a standard DirectShow filter external to my application.  My push source audio filter and simple audio mixer filters are being used as private, unregistered filters and are internal to my application.emp  pI am having a weird problem that only occurs when I try to make multiple input connections to my mixer, which does indeed accept them.  Currently, I am attempting to connect both a Capture Filter and my custom Push Source audio filter to my mixer filter.  Whenever I try to do that the second upstream filter connection fails. Regardless of whether I connect the Capture Filter first or Push Source audio filter first, the second upstream filter connection always fails.p  pThe first test I ran was to try connecting just the Capture Filter to the mixer.  That worked fine.p  pThe second test I ran was to try connecting just the Push Source audio filter to the mixer.  That worked fine.p  pBut as soon as try to do both I get a no combination of intermediate filters could be found error.  I did several hours of deep digging into the media negotiation calls hitting my filter from the graph builder and then I found the problem.  For some reason, the filter graph is dragging in the ancient strongIndeo R Audio Softwarestrong codec into the chain.  p  pI discovered this because despite the fact that codec did have a media format that matched my filter in strongalmoststrong every regard major type, sub type, format type, wave format parameters, it had an extra 2 bytes at the end of its pbFormat data member and that was enough to fail the strongequalsstrong test since that test does a comparison between the source and target pbFormat areas by comparing the cbFormat value of each media type.  The Indeo codec has a cbFormat value of 20 while my filter has a cbFormat value of 18, which is the size of a tWAVEFORMATEX data structure.  In a way its a good thing the Indeo pbFormat has that weird size because the first 18 bytes of its 20 byte area were exactly equal to the pbFormat area of my mixer filters supported media type.  Without that anomaly I never would have known that ancient codec was being drug in.  Im surprised its being drug in at all since it has known exploits and vulnerabilities.  What is most confusing is that this is happening on my mixer filters strongoutputstrong pin, not one of the input pins, and strongI have not made a single downstream connection yetstrong when building up my pin connections.p  pCan anyone tell me why DirectShow is trying to drag in that codec despite the fact that the media formats for the both incoming filters, the Capture Filter and the Push Source filter, are identical and dont need any intermediate filters at all since they match my mixer filters input pins supported format exactly  How can I fix this problemp  pAlso, I noticed that even in the single filter attachment tests above that succeeded, my mixer output pin was still getting queried for media formats.  Why is that when as I said, at this point in building up my pin connections I have not connected anything to the output pin of my mixer filterp  p UPDATE 1 p  pI have learned that you can avoid the intelligent connection behavior entirely by using IFilterGraph.ConnectDirect instead of IGraphBuilder.Connect.  I switched over to DirectConnect and turns out that the input pin on my mixer filter is coming back as already connected.  That may be what is causing the graph builder to drag in the Indeo codec filter.  Now that I have this new diagnostic information I will correct the problem and update this post with my results.p
Negative 2167 pI have an apache server under Debian that runs several RESTful application written in Python with Django and Piston. These apps use SQLAlchemy to access data from a MySQL server.

Negative 2167 pI use RTMFP with NetGroup and Adobe Cirrus. Broadcasting settings are 320x240 with 5 fps.p  pHowever, in some cases it takes a long time for the webcam stream to appear 1020 seconds, even if having a 11 connection. If the stream appears eventually, it looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI8dZz.jpg altRTMFP webcam qualityp  pI think this comes from a high keyframe interval and the subscribers needs to wait for the next keyframe, so that the stream appears properly. This happens in contrast to streaming servers, where the server caches the last keyframes from the publisher stream.p  pMy question is how I am able to tune the broadcasting, e.g. set the keyframe interval and other settings. Can you recommend a good setup And, why is this issue not popular I havent found much information about itp  pThanks, Valentinp

Negative 2167 pIm currently developing a web api, with WCF web api, which allows me to write restful apis. One concern I have is security. For this reason I decided to protect my api with the OAuth protocol which works very good. However, the team got to the conclusion that our own applications shouldnt be authorized by oauth, instead they sould be authorized by http basic, meaning that the client application should send username and password.p  pSo I have 2 questionsp  ol liHow can I set up WCF Web Api to work with SSL, Im using Web Api preview 6, and the project is a MVC3 applicationli liI have an operation handler which takes care of the creation of IPrincipal from the client access token, and then injects it into the operation parameters, so I can access the users info. I would like to have in the same operation handler a condition where I could check if the authorization scheme is OAuth or http basic, and then in the case of http basic extract the users credentials and authenticate that specific user against my data base, if authentication is successful create an IPrincipal and inject it to the operation parameters. However, as I see it, everytime an application using http basic requests something to the api, I would have to go to the data base and authenticate. So my question is Am I in the right path, or this could be accomplished in some other wayli ol  pAny answers would be appreciate it. Thank you in advancedp

After session authentication, nothing happens until the data and end events are finally emitted 2 minutes later, at which time the body is parsed and saved to my database.p  pIs this more likely to be an issue with my Node application or a problem with my server, which is an EC2 small instance running Amazon Linux  How is it that its taking 2 minutes from the time the packet with body of the request arrives until its passed as a chunk to my applicationp  pThanks.p  pUpdate I modified parser.onBody in libhttp.js to log b and I can see that this method is not being invoked until the end of the two minute delay.  This seems to indicate that the problem is at a lower level than my application.  I also changed ec2 instances, but that didnt help.p

However, this does not preserve the fragment back stack, so when the user loads the application and presses the back button to move up in the application flow, the app quits instead of going up.p  pWhat I need at this point is to be able to get access to the application back stack and save it to a bundle when necessary, much the way the system does in codeonSaveInstanceStatecode.  Ive read the documentation for codeFragmentManager.saveFragmentInstanceStatecode but Im not sure how to use this to accomplish my goal.  Can anybody point me in the right directionp  pIm using the fragment implementation from the Android compatibility library.p

Negative 2167 pSo Ive read the questions on here about hierarchical builds like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3709321creatingahierarchicalbuildwithsconsCreating a Hierarchical Build with SConsap  pI want to do real hierarchical construction of two standalone repos that both use scons that I set up as subrepos using mercurial.  Below is the file layout that illustrates what I want to do.p  pDesired Layoutp  precodeprojectroot  new project that builds bar app using the libfoo built from source      libfoosubrepo  standalone project repo from bitbucket         src             SConscript             libfoo.c             libfoo.h         test             SConscript             testfoo.c         SConstruct      barappsubrepo  standalone project repo from bitbucket that uses libfoo         src             SConscript             bar.c             bar.h         test             SConscript             testbar.c         SConstruct      test         SConscript         testbarwithfoo.c     SConstruct codepre  pSo I have two separate repos, both using scons.  The first one, libfoo, can be cloned standalone and built using scons.  When running scons in the libfoo root directory, it builds a static library of libfoo in src and builds a unit test executable in test that links against the static library in src.p  pThe second repo has the bar app that depends on libfoo.  It too can be cloned standalone and if libfoo is installed on the build system, it can be built using scons.p  pWhat I want to do, is set up a new repo projectroot that has both the libfoo and bar app repos set as subrepos using mercurial.  So when you clone this new repo, it automatically pulls down bar app and its dependency, libfoo.  Then I want to be able to run scons in the root of this new repo and have it execute scons in the libfoosubrepo root to build libfoo and its unit tests.  Then I want it to run scons in the barappsubrepo root to build bar and tell it to link against the libfoo static library in libfoosubreposrc.  Lastly, I want it to build some new unit tests in tests that use both the libfoo static library and the source files from bar app to test bar app and libfoo when combined together.p  pAs far as I can tell from reading the scons documentation is that I would need to create a custom Builder for subrepo that would run scons in a subshell.  Then I could add libfoo.subrepo and barapp.subrepo to the projectroot directory and some how rig it so that when the builder goes to execute the command to build libfoo.subrepo that it translates the source name into a path that it executes scons in.p  precodebuilding libfoo.subrepo translates into executing cd libfoosubrepo scons codepre  pIt looks to me like scons cannot recursively build standalone scons projects.  Everything Ive read assumes you have the ability to create SConscript files in the subfolders and then have the root SConstruct file depend on the SConscript files.  Please tell me there is a way to do what I want with scons.  I dont want to go back to make.p  pThanks.p
Negative 2167 pIm trying to use a youtube video as a webgl texture and at the moment I cant make it work because of a few issues. Does anyone have any experience with doing this and can point me in the right directiontell me its not possiblep  pIm following the approach detailed here  a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenwebglanimatingtexturesinwebgl relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenwebglanimatingtexturesinwebgla where basically you make a texture from a html5 video element and keep reading frames into a texture used in your scene. This works really well for normal videos, but youtube will only provide AFAIK html5 video via an iframe, which is obviously on their domain rather than mine. This means its hard to query the iframe for the video element to use as a texture my quick attempt at proxying this doesnt work because the iframe src uses relative urls, though I didnt try this thoroughly. I also tried using mediaElement.js to wrap the element as html5 videolike this  a hrefhttpmediaelementjs.comexamplesnameyoutube relnofollowhttpmediaelementjs.comexamplesnameyoutubea  though I quickly realised that this is only a facade so doesnt really work as input for the texture atleast I think thats the issue.p  pI dont want to do anything that involves downloading and reencoding the YT video or anything along those lines as I need something that can be done programatically, though either client or server side is fine.p  pIm pretty sure the problem is just getting hold of a video element that contains the youtube video, but Im pretty new to webgl, and totally new to video in webgl, so open to any ideas there All help gratefully received  thank youp

This way I can better track trends during outages.p  pIm a bit at a loss as to how to write this logic to a stored procedure.  I would conceivably have to declare the new hour and minute values into variables and for the StartHour column always keep it rounded to the DATEPART hour value even if it was 1645...I want to insert 16 into the StartHour column.  However, with the EndHour column, I want to insert stronga rounded up hourly valuestrong 17 and then 18 because we went over an hour in that case stronginto the EndHour columnstrong.   This would hopefully describe via these two rows the close to two hours the outage occurred.  And in turn it would allow for an easy join to our orders tablep  pAny guidance on a stored procedure for this logic would be appreciated.p

Negative 2167 pIm having a strange issue. I have a database with existing items, I added a new validation rule so some of the items in the database dont comply with this new rule.p  pI have a loop that finds a record, changes an element then saves it back to the database, like thisp  precodeforeachint foo in bar      Model model  db.Model.Findfoo     model.updated  true     ifModelState.IsValid              db.Entrymodel.State  EntityState.Modified         db.SaveChanges       codepre  pI figured that for records that dont comply to the new validation rule would just not be updated because the codeModelState.IsValidcode wouldnt pass. This is not the case though, it trows a validation failed exception. So I put it in a codetry catchcode and figured while Im at it Ill log the error so I know what records arnt valid. So it now looks like thisp  precodeforeachint foo in bar      Model model  db.Model.Findfoo     model.updated  true     try              db.Entrymodel.State  EntityState.Modified         db.SaveChanges          catchException x               log error         ifModelState.IsValid                      db.ErrorLogs.AdderrorLog             db.SaveChanges                codepre  pThis also trows a validation failed exception, i guess because the exception in the codetrycode is not cleared. So fine, I decide to just try, and not catch the error. So it looks like thisp  precodeforeachint foo in bar      Model model  db.Model.Findfoo     model.updated  true     try              db.Entrymodel.State  EntityState.Modified         db.SaveChanges          catch            codepre  pNow what ends up happening is that say I have 100 records that are cycled through the foreach loop, if 27 fails validation every record that comes after fails and therefore is not updated p  pThis is very aggravating, how can I fix this Is there a way to clear the validation error Why is the error persisting to all the other loops Is it because codedbcode was declared outside the loop sAnd why is it passing the ModelState.IsValid in the first placesp  pThanksp

Negative 2167 pId like to write a Qt application which main purpose is to warn the user that there are things to do before he should shut down the computer.

I also want the user to be able to interrupt the shut down process, like those applications allow the user to say Cancel.p  pemIs there a way to do this in Qtemp  pIf not, how to do this at least in a gnome session Support for more desktop environments would be nice, but currently this application is for me and my friends only, and we all use gnome.p  pI read about the signal codeQCoreApplicationaboutToQuitcode, but the documentation says that it doesnt allow user interaction. My application doesnt use any widget maybe only a system tray icon, so the codeQWidgetcloseEventcode isnt of any use either.p  pWill handling the appropriate posix signal help But as far as I know, such a signal handler may only contain trivial statements and asking the user whether to really shut down isnt trivial.p  pHere are some details if it helps When the user wants to shut down the computer, my application will check if the repository he configured to watch is clean, i.e. there is nothing to commit. If there is something to be committed, the application should warn the user and let him choose to ignore the uncommitted files or to abort the shut down process in order to commit the changes.p

The codeM2Ecode plugin is a little problematic because it cannot handle entity enhancement. p  pSo from programming side it is a little clumsy that we cannot build the whole project on Maven under Eclipse by one click, but have to let codeSTSEclipsecode to codebuildcode the project first and then run codeAntcode script to codeenhancecode the entities, then coderefreshcode the project, then coderefreshcode the codeserver deploymentcode. Not very effective.p  pI guess this is an issue for a while so create this thread to see if there is any updates.p  pThere seems a tool availablea hrefhttpopenjpa.apache.orgopenjpaeclipseenhancementbuilder.html relnofollowOpenJPA Eclipse Tooling Buildera But it seems not supporting latest EclipseSTS 2.9.1 is based on Eclipse 3.7, that tool only cover to 3.4.p  pSo the question becomes is there any wayor tools we can integrate everythingcodebuildcode, codecompile with enhancementcode together possibly on Maven by only designing POMp  pHappy to learn any suggestions.

The only way that i found is to write inside a file the data and then calling the system function from Fortanp  precode  call systemR CMD BATCH script.r outcome.out codepre  pand read the outcomes of the analysis from Fortran in outcome.out. This present some problems in order to manage the file outcome.out when the simulation give bogus numbers. Does exists a more elegant way to call R from Fortranp

Negative 2167 pI have some socket.io node.js servers running as amazon instances, when connecting directly to an instance, my socket.io application can connect and reconnect in a few milliseconds. However, when I direct the application through the load balancer, the application is a lot slower to connect and reconnect taking 5 seconds.p  pI have configured the load balancer to forward TCP port 80, as well as well the port that my node servers listen on port 3000. Are there any other ports required by socket.io to function optimally Or is my issue caused by something other than portsp  pThanks.p

Negative 2167 pI want to use a Genetic Algorithm for finding the shortest path within an undirected graph. I have two questions about this regarding Crossover and Mutation. Ive been researching how crossover can be performed in similar situations to this, and the most popular algorithm out there seems to be PMX, my understanding of this is a partial path is swapped between 2 parent chromosomes to make the offspring. The issue Im having with this is, there is massive scope for almost all of the offspring to become invalid isnt there I was wondering if you could confirm this for me, and if Im wrong, please correct me and explain it.p  pOn separate but relevant note I did have an idea for how to do this, but I dont know if its a good idea, simply select 2 parents where they share the same node in their path and crossover at that point, so all of the offspring remain valid.p  pMy second issue is with Mutation I have a general idea for how this can be done would it be wise to select one node and remove it, and relink the path by an alternative meansp  pThanks p

Negative 2167 pIm using Entity Framework 5 with a code first approach.p  pI have two classes that have a manytomany relationship to each other, codeMoviecode and codePersoncode. A codeMoviecode is related to a codePersoncode via a codeCharactercode. Each codeMoviecode can have multiple characters.p  precodepublic class Movie      public int Id  get set      public string Title  get set      public int Year  get set      public virtual ICollectionltCharactergt Characters  get set        public Movie          Characters  new HashSetltCharactergt        public class Character      public string Name  get set          public virtual Movie Movie  get set          public virtual Person Person  get set    public class Person      public int Id  getset      public string Name  get set      public virtual ICollectionltCharactergt Characters  get set       public Person          Characters  new HashSetltCharactergt       codepre  pSometimes a codeMoviecode can have one codePersoncode that plays more than one codeCharactercode.  Im running into a problem when trying to add a codeMoviecode under this circumstance... p  pLets say Movie1 has 2 characters both played by Person1. When saving changes EF will start at Character1 and see that Person1 doesnt exist in the database and insert that codePersoncode to codedbo.Personcode. Then it will go to Character2 but see that Person1 already exists and will throw a primary key violation.p  pIn my codeMovieRepositorycode I have an codeAddMovie entitycode method. I loop through each codeCharactercode of the codeMoviecode and check to see if the related codePersoncode exists in the database. If they do then I set the codePersoncode property to the existing codePersoncode. This works under normal cases but if the codePersoncode doesnt exist at all then Im not sure how to avoid the PK violation, and this is my problem p  precodepublic class MovieRepository  RepositoryltMoviegt      public MovieRepositoryMovieContext context  basecontext       public override void AddMovie entity          foreach var character in entity.Characters              var person  Context.People.FirstOrDefaultp gt p.Id  character.Person.Id             if person  null                 character.Person  person                  Context.Movies.Addentity       codepre  pJust to add a little more info.

Negative 2167 pOk so sorry for being blunt here but I have been developing on IE 8 and IE9 for the past 2 years and cant seem to get this right. I work at abhor company and develop for their website. For some reason IE8 or IE9 defaults to a lower document mode like ie7 or ie8. I have tried everything...p  p1 put HTML 5 doctype and nothing else. According to Microsoft this should be enough 2 put html5 doctype and put xuacompatible meta tag first in the page under title and set to either edge or IE8 or IE9 respectively.p  pMy page looks like thisp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lt[if lt IE 7]gt      lthtml classnojs ltie9 ltie8 ltie7gt lt[endif]gt lt[if IE 7]gt         lthtml classnojs ltie9 lt  ie8gt lt[endif]gt lt[if IE 8]gt         lthtml classnojs ltie9gt lt     [endif]gt lt[if gt IE 8]gt lthtml classnojsgt lt   [endif]gt  ltheadgt ltmeta charsetutf8gt ltmeta httpequivXUACompatible    contentIEedge,chrome1gt codepre  pIts really getting frustrating because everything I read says it should work. Microsoft claims this will work or even just settings HTML 5 doctype will work. Ive heard to set a http header to fix but honestly, is Microsoft serious I find it hard to believe that developers need tot change their apache settings to add a http header to Make page render Im standards modep  pCan someone please help me here What am I missing Im really beginning to hate Microsoft Even morep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI recently discovered that my company has the show intranet sites in compatibility view checked off and it looks l like if i uncheck it then it will work fine. However, that is not the solution Everywhere i read i see that if you see the XUAcompatible meta tag or http header it should take precedence. Well this is a complete lie. Does anyone else have an answer I understand that external users will be fine however my business is testing this and they are asking questions because they are internal and its hard to convince them and to tell them to uncheck the box. It doesnt give them a great feeling. Also, i cant have the desktop engineering team remove that because it was put in place because older applications internally are not written to support IE8,9 so they need this.p  pAny help is appreciated. thanksp  pThanksp

Negative 2167 pIll try to be short and clear with this question.p  pWe have an asp.net mvc app that uses entity framework 4.p  pOur business model is relatively straightforward We have an object which corresponds to a table called Photos. That photos table has a handful of columns that match up to properties on the object. Description,Title,Date etc. It also has a number columns that reference foreign keys for other tables AuthorId,LicenseId etc...p  pThe author and license tables are complex in their own right, with multiple fields Title,Summary,Date etc.p  pI have multiple clients using this application to view their photos. I would like each client to dictate what fields they see when viewing the photos, as well as what fields they see when editing those fields.p  pMy thought is to have tables setup saying clienta should see Field1,Field2 and Field3 when viewing their photos  and clientb should see Field1,Field4 and Field5. But some of these fields are not simply columns in the main photos table, they may be fields in a child table. so Field1 might be Table.Photos.Title   which corresponds to an object as Objects.Photo.title... but Field3 might be Table.Licenses.LicenseSummary  which corresponds to an object as Objects.Photo.License.LicenseSummaryp  pIm trying to figure out the methodology that we would use to have a very data driven environment so in the DB I can say, display this objectproperty for viewing or editing and then it would know how to map to whatever table it needs to pull that information. also, during editing... give it some way to pull a list of available values if it is that type of property, and not just a text field.p  pIm looking for an example of what this might involve, our model is actually more complex than this, but this is just an idea of what we are trying to accomplish.

Negative 2167 pOk so i am creating a website for a friend and he wants the site to work in the following way. p  pHe has one page that has two sections that can appear. Only one section can appear at one time. A button is used to switch between the different sections. The way im currently doing this is by using two divs and dispalyinghiding them when the button is pressed. So if section 1 is showing and the button is pressed section 1 will fade out and section two will face in.p  pThis all works great, however what he would like it to be able to send people links to his site and depending on the extension show that particular section. For example, lets say these two sections are credits and content. If he send someone the url of www.site.comcredits then he would like the credits section to show. And if he sends the url of www.site.comcontent then he would like the content section to show up. He would also like to maintain the button click to switch between the two.p  pI have been looking into it and it seems that this could be done using hash values  for example www.site.comcredits. Is there any way of doing this but using s instead of sp  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe other thing about this is that he would not like the page to refresh when the button is clicked he would just like to use javascript to change the section.p

Wouldnt that mean then that preprocessing middle would regenerate a static resource ie somestyles.less  somestyles.css after every request If so, would it be better to simply preprocess through a build system such as grunt.js in advance and serve those files Id like the final rendering of the css and js to be concatenated to one file and minified.p  pAlso, is it worthwhile to prerender html from templates such as jade on pages with only static content Or is that more trouble than its worthp

Negative 2167 pIm using Denis outstanding tableDnD jquery plugin. I would like to allow users to dragdrop rows but only when their mouse is within a particular td within the row.p  pSo far Ive tried two methodsnote that the var tr contains the jquery row element Im operating on. the td idqueueposition is the one Im trying to enable dragging for.p  pI think that tableDnD only checks for the nodrag class when it starts up.  adding or deleting the nodrop class dynamically doesnt change anything. So I tried two ways to do what I need to do.p  pAttempt one was to dive into tableDnD internals and try to call its makeDraggable function. Attempt two was to reinitialize tableDnD after addingremoving the nodrop class.p  pEither of these methods seems to work to strongenablestrong dragging when in the allowed td. Neither of them properly strongdisablesstrong dragging when leaving the td.  Once a row is enabled in the mouseenter event it stays enabled forever. p  pId prefer to find a way to do what I need without modifying tableDnD.p  pAny suggestions on how to make this workp  precodetr   .addClassnodrag   .findtd[idqueueposition] .onmouseenter,function       tr.removeClassnodrag      .tableDnD.makeDraggabledocument.getElementByIdtableLeft  .onmouseleave,function       tr.addClassnodrag         .tableDnD.makeDraggabledocument.getElementByIdtableLeft    .onmouseenter,function         tr.removeClassnodrag        tableLeft.tableDnDonDrop handleDragDrop    .onmouseleave,function         tr.addClassnodrag       tableLeft.tableDnDonDrop handleDragDrop         codepre

Negative 2167 pThere are two sites. The main site, where there is an authentication logic for users and second site that works as an additional service for main site and has its own database, code, technology etc. Both sites are own by different teams. Second site should be able to authenticate users, but has no access to database and code of the main site and is hosted on the different domain. br Now, authentication works in following wayp  pstrong1strong. Second site show login page where in an iframe the login form of main site is loaded.br strong2strong. When user enters his credentials and clicks enter, all authenticate logic runs through the main site and user is authenticated only by main site.br strong3strong. Main site sends request through https that informs second site about user that needs to be logged in by some unique identifier of the user email.br strong4strong. Second site receives request from main site and simply creates authentication cookies without any validation and even without to be able to access to the user credentials because of login form in iframe of main site.brp  pThe next problem appears herebr  Encryption of the messages from main site to second site. Second site uses asp.net mvc, but main site can use any different technology. Every message can contain additional piece of information, such as login and password for main site.p  pWhich kind of encryption can be used here to encrypt message through the sites Maybe someone know more appropriate way of doing this kind of interaction between sites. The main goal for all of this is easy integration between main site and second site.p  pThanks in advance, Dima. p

I want to do this in order to speed up the rate at which I can upload files because most of the time is lost waiting for pages to load.p  pIve tested this with a much simpler version of my program and have managed to speed up simple tasks by 210 times by having tens to hundreds of threads open with their own WebDrivers. p  pThe problem is, whenever I run more than strongem1emstrong WebDriver the entire thing begins to randomly freak out at times, and at other times not work at all. I tried to use emPhantomJSDriverem along with the latest emPhantomJS.exeem, however at times it would work, and most of the times it would do nothing.

Negative 2167 pI have a fairly complex calculated measure that works perfectly for each row of data from a cube. However, I then need a sum of those values line by line. But the behavior of calculated measures seems to be in the subtotal and total lines in Excel, its performing the calculation again instead of summing the previous rows. Is there a way to have a calculated measure that performs its calculation on each row, but they does a traditional SUM in the total and subtotalsp  pThanks in advance.p

I just wanted to display the menu on this scenario. p  pOn some point, when I swipe to the right the drawer to be opened, but instead the viewPager got triggered and transferred to the next page. p  pCould I possibly put a border like drawable instead, in the drawer menu so that by the time I click the border or drag it it will open the drawer The blue line is just an added edit but not in the actual scenario. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaZknM.png altenter image description herep  precodeswitcharg0              Android tab is selected              case 0                 DrawerLayoutFragment androidFragment  new DrawerLayoutFragment                 data.putIntcurrentpage, arg01                 androidFragment.setArgumentsdata                 return androidFragment  codepre  pstrongDrawerLayoutFragmentstrong p  precode public class DrawerLayoutFragment extends Fragment implements SimpleGestureListener     private SimpleGestureFilter detector       private DrawerLayout mDrawerLayout     private ListView mDrawerList     private ActionBarDrawerToggle mDrawerToggle      private CharSequence mDrawerTitle     private CharSequence mTitle     private String[] mPlanetTitles      public void onCreate Bundle savedInstanceState              super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         detector  new SimpleGestureFiltergetActivity,this           mTitle  mDrawerTitle  getActivity.getTitle             TargetApiBuild.VERSIONCODES.ICECREAMSANDWICH     public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,                              Bundle savedInstanceState           View rootView  inflater.inflateR.layout.drawerlayoutfragment, container, false          mPlanetTitles  rootView.getResources.getStringArrayR.array.planetsarray         mDrawerLayout  DrawerLayout rootView.findViewByIdR.id.drawerlayout         mDrawerList  ListView rootView.findViewByIdR.id.leftdrawer           set a custom shadow that overlays the main content when the drawer opens         mDrawerLayout.setDrawerShadowR.drawable.drawershadow, GravityCompat.START          set up the drawers list view with items and click listener          mDrawerList.setAdapternew ArrayAdapterltStringgtgetActivity,                 R.layout.drawerlistitem, mPlanetTitles         mDrawerList.setOnItemClickListenernew DrawerItemClickListener           enable ActionBar app icon to behave as action to toggle nav drawer          getActivity.getActionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue         getActivity.getActionBar.setHomeButtonEnabledtrue           ActionBarDrawerToggle ties together the the proper interactions          between the sliding drawer and the action bar app icon         mDrawerToggle  new ActionBarDrawerToggle                 getActivity,                   host Activity                  mDrawerLayout,          DrawerLayout object                  R.drawable.icdrawer,   nav drawer image to replace Up caret                  R.string.draweropen,   open drawer description for accessibility                  R.string.drawerclose   close drawer description for accessibility                                public void onDrawerClosedView view                  getActivity.getActionBar.setTitlemTitle                 getActivity.invalidateOptionsMenu  creates call to onPrepareOptionsMenu                  Log.donDrawerClosed, inside                           public void onDrawerOpenedView drawerView                  getActivity.getActionBar.setTitlemDrawerTitle                 getActivity.invalidateOptionsMenu  creates call to onPrepareOptionsMenu                               mDrawerLayout.setDrawerListenermDrawerToggle            if savedInstanceState  null              selectItem0                    return rootView            public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu              MenuInflater inflater  getActivity.getMenuInflater            inflater.inflateR.menu.mainmenu, menu             return getActivity.onCreateOptionsMenumenu                Override         public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item                 The action bar homeu p action should open or close the drawer.

Negative 2167 pOne of the things that really draws me to TDD is the clear development of your spec alongside implementation. p  pI am seeking to implement a constructor that accepts a configuration objectp  precodefunction MyConstructorconf  codepre  pcodeconfcode is currently specd to have two keys codeacode and codebcode, where codeacode is a codeRegExpcode and codebcode is a codeFunctioncode, and as part of my TDD spec elucidation ambitions, I am writing tests that spec out this object as such p  ul liI would like codeMyConstructorcode to throw an codeErrorcode if either codeacode is not a codeRegExpcode or codebcode is not a codeFunctioncode. li licodeMyConstructorcode throws an codeErrorcode if either codeacode or codebcode is missing from the configuration. li ul  pNow, I know that I could encapsulate this behavior in some other constructor, say a codeConfigurationcode constructor that creates configuration objects. But the way I am seeing this now, regardless of where this behavior ends up, this behavior has to be encapsulated emsomewhereem for this spec to be elaborated via TDD.p  pThe problem is I seems to me that as the number of keys on the codeconfcode object grows, so does the number of testsexponentially This is especially due to the second bullet above. p  pFor example, say I have 4 keys codeacode, codebcode, codeccode and codedcode, and I need to make sure that if any are missing an Error is thrown. emIt seemsem that this requires that I write a ton of identical, banal tests that cover all the possibilities strongcombinationsstrong for missing keys. That doesnt sound right Yet, I cant think of a good way explicitly or inductively test that all scenarios are covered. Any thoughtsp

Negative 2167 pI am building an application where I have a ruler that is a UIImage that I use to scroll a UITableView.  My UITableView has UILabels on each cell that display text.  When the user leaves the ruler over a cell, the ruler has on it a UILabel that displays the contents of the UITableViewCell that it is over top of.  All of this functionality is in place, and is working fine.  What I would like to do is when I scroll the ruler up or down, is to be able to view the contents of the table rows behind it dynamically while the ruler is moving, so that the user can see right through the ruler.  As a concept, I realize that this technique is called masking, but normally masking is done using two images.  What Im trying to do is use a UIImage that has a UILabel on top of it, to display the contents of the rows behind it while it is moving.  Can anyone show me how to do this, or point me in the right directionp  pHere is an image of what it is I am trying to implementp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuJq5W.png altenter image description herep  pIf you look at the image that I am using, the ruler image is partially hiding the bottom of the text in the third row, and partially hiding the top of the text in the fourth row.  I would like the ruler to display the bottom of the text in row 3, and the top of the text in row 4 rather than hiding it when it is in this transition state.  I hope this clarifies the problem and makes sense.p  pThanks in advance to all who reply.p

Negative 2167 pI am trying to create a rectangular region on my PDF that will go to a URL.

The text shows up and is a clickable link, but if I specify a rectangle that is much larger than the text, only the text is clickable. In addition, modified the code a bit so that I could provide a label and a URL separately, and when I did this and provided an empty string, there was nothing anywhere in the rectangle that was clickable.p  pHowever, if I use the UIKit routines for creating a PDF basically UIGraphicsBeginPDFContextToFile and descendants, then the call to UIGraphicsSetPDFContextURLForRect creates a region in the resulting PDF file that is clickable, even if I do not provide any text.p  pHere is the method that I am using to create the rectangle linkp  precode voidrectLinkNSString urlString frameCGRectframeRect cropBoxCGRectcropBoxRect sourceContextCGContextRefcontext      UIGraphicsPushContextcontext  ifdef OUTPUTTEXTLINKOUTLINE     CGContextSetLineWidthcontext, 5.0     CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColorcontext, [UIColor purpleColor].CGColor     CGContextStrokeRectcontext, frameRect endif      NSURL url  [NSURL URLWithStringurlString]     UIGraphicsSetPDFContextURLForRecturl, frameRect      UIGraphicsPopContext  codepre  pThe OUTPUTTEXTLINKOUTLINE define is something that I am using for testing to make sure that the rectangle I am passing in is in fact where it is supposed to be.p  pAnd here is a call I am making to the above method on the first page of my PDF generationp  precode[self rectLinkhttpstackoverflow.com frameCGRectMake474,22,28,28 cropBoxcropBoxRect sourceContextcontext] codepre  pThe variable cropBoxRect refers to the crop box for the current page, and context is the value that I am saving from the CGPDFContextCreateWithURL call at the start of the document.p

Negative 2167 pIm currently using msdeploys dbDacFx provider to deploy a .dacpac to a database. The dacpac expects three SQLCMD variables. The syntax I am using looks like this p  pcodesetParamkindSqlCommandVariable,scopeDatabase.dacpac,matchfoo1,valuefoo1 valuecodep  pIve been trying everything I can find but unfortunately there is next to no documentation around this process. The output I am getting from msdeploy says codeMissing values for the following SqlCmd variables foo1 foo2 foo3code. p  pIf anybody can spot what Im doing wrong that would be fantastic. If anybody knows where to get some documentation that would be fantastic as well. I would gladly accept any answers that say what I should do, but I would love to understand what all of these values are and WHY Im doing it wrong.p  pEdit At this point it would appear that such an option does not exist for dbDacFx. Our use case for this feature is attempting to deploy the same template database managed in visual studio sql projects to 70 databases, which we would like to do in parallel. dbSqlPackage besides being deprecated is not thread safe and does not allow for parallel deployments. dbDacFx overcomes this shortcoming however it cannot in my experimentation be passed SqlCmdVariables that reside at the project level, and it cannot use publish profiles like dbSqlPackage can. Im in contact with a member of the web deploy team and will post any updates if I am able to figure out how to overcome any of these shortcomings. p

Negative 2167 pI know in Big O Notation we only consider the highest order, leading polynomial term because we are basically placing this theoretic worst case bound on computetime complexity but sometimes I get confused on when we can legally dropconsider terms as constants. For example if our equation ran in p  pOn33  we pull out the 13 fraction, treat it as a constant, drop it, then say our algo runs in On3 time.p  pWhat about in the case of On3logn2 In this case could we pull out the 1logn2 term, treat it as a constant, drop it, and then ultimately conclude our algorithm is On3. It does not look like we can, but what differentiates this case from the above case both can be treated as constants because their values are relatively small in comparison to the leading polynomial term in the numerator but in the second case, the denominator term really brings down the worst case bound convergence as n values get larger and larger.p

Negative 2167 pI have an application written in VB.net. In that application I have multiple forms and lots of functionality. The form the application starts with, is some kind of menu. In the background, I have a list of menu items that a user can see and use to open a new form. It is possible to search through all those menu items via a textbox where you can fill in some text and the code then compares all the menu items names to the filled in text and shows the result. This event is fired on every textchanged event of this textbox. But if the user types in a name that occures a lot like  100 times or so the view takes some time 3 to 5 sec to display all those results. Now I would like to know if it is possible to abort the first event handler if the same event is called again. That means that if I am typing in the textbox and for the first 4 or 5 letters almost all menu items are matches, so I want to abort that search and start a new one right away. Is there any way to detect that the same event is called again and abort the currect one to make the new one start right awayp  pThanks in advance for reading this and helping me solve this problemp

Negative 2167 pWe have a working Drupal 7 production site developed by an outside vendor. Now I want a local development version on my office computer Windows, Im afraid.  I set up a WAMP stack, git cloned the working production site to my computer, and copied the database.  I also copied from the production site sitesdefaultsettings.php and sitesdefaultfiles .  The result partially works.p  pThe one problem that may not need sitespecific details is that no menu works.  Every place a menu is supposed to appear, Drupal generates the containers for the top level links, but these containers are empty.  Examples include the Megamenu and the black bar at the top you get on login.  adminstructuremenu lists our various menus, but the links under Operations list links, edit menu, and add menu do not appear. adminstructuremenumanagemainmenu for example shows the menu structure with the moveme icons but without any menu names or operations links. adminstructuremenuitem539edit for example shows all the proper information.p  pNote that it is not only menus that are not working.  Other stuff is missing.  Anything that gets shoveled into a template dynamically rather than specified by editing the content of some page is missing.  What is working  Anything you enter into any field when creatingediting a Basic Page or other page type is working.  So, for example, news stories show up fine we have a news page type, but a container that is supposed to show a news story title in an  tag is empty.p  pI must have missed something in trying to clone the production site because production works.  But I dont know what.  Maybe if I had an idea as to what could cause the problems above, it could give me a place to start looking.  Any ideas what might cause such a problems, especially something that might be missed in a git and db clonep

Negative 2167 pI am currently doing a project on speaker verification using Hidden Markov Models. I chose MFCC for my feature extraction. I also intend to apply VQ to it. I have implemented HMM and tested it on Eisners data spreadsheet found here a hrefhttpwww.cs.jhu.edujasonpapers relnofollowhttpwww.cs.jhu.edujasonpapersa and got correct results. p  pUsing voice signals, I seem to have missed something since I was not getting correct acceptance I did the probability estimation using the forward algorithm  no scaling applied.I was wondering on what could have I done wrong.

The audio files are of sampling rates 8000 and 22050. Is there something I am lacking here I chose a cluster of 64 for VQ. Each sample is an isolated word. at least 1 second in duration. I havent found a Python function yet to remove the silences in the voice samples so I use Audacity to manually truncate the silence parts. Any help would be appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 2167 pMy question for you guys are really about more resources. Ive gotten stuck in my homework and my school wants me to do stuff with shaders but has frank d luna as a resource which is all written in effect files. Which source code I might add, does not seem to work for most people, including myself. Im trying to learn more about 3d programming and trying to create a simple gridterrain area but it is super hard to find simple and educative source code. p  pI got the book of Frank D luna which to be honest havent entirely helpful. Everything is in effect files which is to my understanding obsolete and is still slightly different compared to vertexpixel shaders. Also, any source code from that book is not able to run properly. But the structure of the code is fantastic.p  pRastertek is a very unhelpful resource as in that he goes through everything at once in everything. Like asking for a page and getting handed a 500 page book. It is very hard to follow and jump back to use as a resource when it consistantly writes codes as a preparation for another tutorial or to complete a past tutorial.p  pIs there any resources that anyone recommend that would be worth spending money on or even better, free It is so much information at times that it is hard to summerize everything so I would love to see short source code examples. Much like Frank d luna, except you know.. effect files and actually working.p

Negative 2167 pI wrote an addin for Outlook years ago that adds entries to a database based on the Items codeConversationIndexcodecodeConversationIdcode properties.

Is there anyone familiar with this, or who can help to get these two values to align I can only imagine these properties come from the exchange server is some fashion, but the Client probably performs some cleansing whereas the EWS API just gives me the raw value less the Base64 for what I presume transport purposes given the XML medium.p  pIf anyone is familiar with this or has done it before I would greatly appreciate any guidance.p  pemSide Noteemp  pThere are probably better ways to identify emails but for now Im stuck with trying to keep these two synonymous. Modifying the outlook addin isnt really an option, and once I migrate a 11 translation to the server and drop the addin Ill have flexibility changing how it work. But for now I need them to run sidebyside. I need to be able to see processes made within Outlook from the web server and viseversa.p

Negative 2167 pI am trying to store and retrieve data that is entered into Excel into Access.  I am an Access newbie and already have an Excel program on the front end, leading me to drive the import from Excel.  I have successfully figured out how to save my Excel Named Range into the desired Access table, but now I need to figure out how to pull specific data from that Access table back into Excel.  I know I can simply use the Get External Data feature from Excel to import the entire Access table into Excel, but I need to be able to only import a specific portion of the table into Excel based upon a predetermined set of parameters.  Is this possible to dop  pAs a background to the program, basically it stores data from part number runs.  Not only do I need to save new part runs into an Access database which I figured out, but I also need to be able to pull previous part number runs from Access back into Excel to perform further analysis.  That is why I need to figure out how to import only a specific portion of the table.

Negative 2167 pWe have an SQL Server Mirroring established between a database on two SQL Server 2012 Standard instances on two different servers. The witness is on a third server running the express edition. The IP addresses not hostnames of primary, mirror and witness servers are mentioned in the mirroring configurations while creating the mirror using SSMS. Now problem is that a change in the IP address of the mirror is required. There is a proper reasoning behind that and it cant be avoided. The system is live and outage should be avoided to the max. The new IP is accessible from both primary and witness. When we take the mirror server out, the mirroring is affected, but as soon the server is back with the same old IP, mirroring resumes appropriately. However, how to change the endpoints IP address without having the need to remove and then recreate the mirror. Is it possible or there is NO way this can be achieved without removerecreatep  pIf there is an absolute need here to do this removerecreate, how to ensure that we dont copy over the complete database and its logs and redo the process from scratch. If all clients access to the primary is blocked during the time to ensure that no transaction is taking place, would this sufficep  pA solution without removerecreate would be the preferred one.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2167 pI am building a page that displays a list of images when you click a button and binds some JavaScript functions to allow you to perform some actions on those images. The html exists on page load, but is hidden until the button is clicked. For some users of the application, Google Chrome consistently crashes when they click to display this list.p  pI have a hunch that Chrome is only crashing for users that have the most images. Im guessing that Chrome is crashing when it tries to load so many images at the same time. I believe this is a browser bug Chrome should be smart enough not to request so many images that it crashes, but until Chrome fixes this behavior, Im going to have to adapt my code. Its possible that adding some sort of pagination will fix this problem, however, the solution isnt really my question. The problem is that I dont have any data to back up my assumption.p  pId like to know how to debugprofile this scenario so I can see if that is the reason it is crashing.p

Negative 2167 pI have a very similar situation to the a hrefhttpwordpress.orgsupporttopicpulldatafromanaspnetdatabase relnofollowperson in this postinga but I want to make sure we are talking about the same thing. So, I have a potential client that wants to take his current ASP website and convert most of it to a WordPress website. He spent a lot of money and time developing this back end system which is mainly to keep track of his inventory to some great detail. The purpose for having WordPress site is he wants his employees to be able to easily update blog postings, news, and some images and perhaps galleries.p  pSo we would rebuild his current website using WordPress but the search capabilities of the site would all be pulled from his current MS SQL server inventory information. I am assuming that there is no plugin for this as Im guessing most of this would have to be customized to his current back end system. I probably know just enough about this to confuse you but for those of you who understand what Im trying to do I would appreciate any input on how to go about accomplishing this or if this is even a viable solution.p  pSo my question here is would this project be worth the time and effortp  pMany thanks, Houston p

Negative 2167 pI am using jQuery to hide and show a complex page. Within that page are numerous video tags. Eventually in IE11 the videos just stop serving.

But when it starts acting up codedocument.getElementByIdm1video.error.codecode returns code4code  which suggests improper encoding. Except that it worked fine for several dozen loads and that same identical encoding profile works for basically every site we build codeh264 standard mp4 encodingcode. Sometimes I can clear browser cache, and close the browser and reopen it, and I will get one video that might finish playing. Usually doesnt. No errors reported.p  pSo maybe someone out there has heard of special instances where using jQuery, dom manipulation and html5 videos in IE11 results in IE stupidity... and perhaps had some way to fix this or at least a better means for troubleshooting than relying on IEs immaculate collection of developer tools.p  pNever the less, it is worth a shout out to the SO community.p  pPS  sorry about the verbose post. I dont know if I can succinctly reduce this to a quick question. If I had to try I would say Has anyone else encountered problems playing html5 videos in IE where constant dom manipulation is happeningp

Negative 2167 h3Backgroundh3  pGoogle Play users really tend not to buy apps, despite their likely quality, so it would be a great thing to distribute your app as free for a certain period during which people experience your app, verify that it would worth an eventual cost, write appreciative reviews and rumor positively about it. And if this optimistic forecast is not totally fulfilled, at least you have raised the indicator of the number of downloads.p  pAnother good way to make users pass the barrier of the billing fear would be to send a limited number of codes of which each one can be used once to download your app for free. You would then distribute these codes to the layers of the user population that could like it and hope that they trigger the download flow.p  pAbout inserting ads in the application, I have to say that I find application with ads really annoying and uglylooking and that I think that if you want people to like your app, you first have to like it yourself. Furthermore, I believe that my content is very good and doesnt deserve to be clouded by showy ads. p  pAbout offering inapp purchases, also that option wouldnt fit my project since Im developing a touristic guide, a sort virtual book lacking of a hierarchical layout so what would I block and why It would be like taking away some entries of an encyclopedia.p  h3Questionh3  pIf you developed and Android app and you plan on selling it, is it possible to distribute it for free on Google Play for a limited timep

Aside of that, how else can I make this faster. p  pI have also mentioned the ranges of the  items in list, to give you the context that the  users   epoch times  footprints per user. p  pThe structure of the data is as follows p  precode             U1              uVegetarianVegan [1401572571,             7.850284461542393e06],             uDumplings [1402051698,             1.408092980963553e05],             uGlutenfree [1400490069,             2.096967508708229e06],             uLawyer [1406549628,             0.0033942020684690575],             uFalafel [1409365870,             0.10524975778067258]         ,         U0              uGasStationGarage [1394649440,             1.1279761215136923e09],             uMusicFestival [1398401459,             1.0948922055743449e07],             uChinese [1408116633,             0.015294426605167652]  codepre  pThe emfloating numberem that you see here after each epoch time, is that users score in THAT category. which I write back after my scoring calculations Code of the scoring now mentioned in the postp  pstrongMore about the datastrong  I have a primary key called user U0, U1 etc. and a secondary key called category , here VegetarianVegan etc. Each of these secondary keys will have a list of strong1 of more itemsstrong. Because of this I need to draw 2 random numberswithout replacement, within low amp high indexes. These items in turn are epoch times.  Conceptually, it says, that a user U1, interacts with VegetarianVegan at multiple epoch times, which I am storing in a list as a value for the categorys key.p  pSay it was uVegetarianVegan [1401572571] , then for each category, I calculate a score and write it back to the same shelve object, post the sythetic data generation.

Negative 2167 pI have home range data sets for 6 animals using UTM coordinates.  I have successfully read them into R and calculated each home range using the Minimum Convex PolygonMCP method.  I would like to know if it is possible to do an incremental area analysis on these data.  What I am looking for is a graph for each home range data set that has the number of data points on the X axis, and the MCP area of the points on the Y axis.  The idea is to look for an asymptote.  If an asymptote is found, then the area is not increasing with additional data.  This would allow me to conclude that the home range of the animal has been fully revealed.  p  pEssentially, I need to know the area gained for each sequential data point.  Does adehabitatHR or its brother packages have this capabilityp  pAny info would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks,p  pBrianp

Negative 2167 pIm new to Quartz.NET, so please bear with me here.p  pIm using Quartz as part of a website that is running on a cluster of servers.  In order to facilitate load balancing of the jobs, they are making calls to a web service running on the same website via a load balancer to ensure that they are executed on the web server with the least load.  Some of these jobs may take several hours to complete.  The problem with this is that the Quartz job and the web service may be running on different machines.  If the machine running the Quartz job crashes while waiting for the web service to complete on another machine then Quartz will not know if the task completed without issue.  I could call the web service asynchronously, but then Quartz will simply think that the job completed successfully immediately regardless of what happens in the web service.  This wont allow me to make sure that the same job doesnt run concurrently since Quartz will think that it completed.  It also doesnt allow for retrying on failure or allow me to see which jobs are currently running.p  pIs there a feature in Quartz that Im overlooking  Has anyone else had to handle a similar situation  Is there a better way to load balance Quartz jobsp  pFor now, Im thinking that Ill need to modify the Quartz JobRunShell class to not set the complete status of the job and trigger not sure if this is the right place.  Then allow my web service to set the statuses when it has completed.  Ill also need to add code to handle cases where the web service crashes and the job is never completed.  To do this, Im planning on my web service creating a thread to periodically tell Quartz that the job is still running via a new timestamp field that Ill add to the database.  Ill have to periodically check the running jobs to see if they are still running via the new field and if they havent been updated in a while say 5 times the update period then Ill assume that the job has failed and make the job as failed and retry where applicable.p  pAny help  comments would be appreciated.p  pEDIT Im using Quartz.Net version 2.3p

Negative 2167 pI have a basic Django app Django 1.7 with an AngularJS 1.2.19 frontend using basic routing.

Negative 2167 pAccording to the a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginedocspythonmodulesrouting relnofollowdocs on App Enginea, when using the appspot.com domain you have to do some trickery with codedotcode instead of code.code in subdomains.p  blockquote   pPlease note that in April of 2013, Google stopped issuing SSL   certificates for doublewildcard domains hosted at appspot.com i.e.   em.em.appspot.com. If you rely on such URLs for HTTPS access to your application, please change any application logic to use dot   instead of .. For example, to access version 1 of application   myapp use a hrefhttps1dotmyapp.appspot.com relnofollowhttps1dotmyapp.appspot.coma instead of   a hrefhttps1.myapp.appspot.com relnofollowhttps1.myapp.appspot.coma.

Negative 2167 pI am trying to prove the scalability of an algorithm of my own, that uses a lot of linear algebra. In my original implementation, I use libeigen to speed up the computations a very significant speed up, that I find extremely handy for my problem. Now Im starting to get into 100s of GiB to even TiBs of data in total. So the problem is becoming intractable to using just memory and swap memory for obvious reasons.p  pIve been looking into STXXL and have run a few basic examples of it, and it seemed to work great for really large sets of data. From further reading though, Ive noticed that eigen wont work with STXXL because it references internal memory, and it wont work with custom constructorsdestructors.p  pIs there perhaps a different solution for dealing with asynchronous file IO for large data that I could use eigen Or do I need give up on eigen and implement my own little matrix calculations for fixed allocationsp

Negative 2167 pI have been trying to understand how do hw interrupts end up in some user space code, through the kernel.p  pMy research led me to understand thatp  p1 An external device needs attention from CPU p  p2 It signals the CPU by raising an interrupt hw trance to cpu or bus p  p3 The CPU asserts, saves current context, looks up address of ISR in the     interrupt descriptor table vectorp  p4 CPU switches to kernel privileged mode and executes the ISR.p  pstrongQuestion 1strong How did the kernel store ISR address in interrupt vector table It might probably be done by sending the CPU some piece of assembly described in the CPUs user manual The more detail on this subject the better please.p  hr  pIn user space how can a programmer write a piece of code that listens to a hw device notificationsp  pThis is what I understand so far.p  p5 The kernel driver for that specific device has now the message from the device and is now executing the ISR.p  pstrongQuestion 3strongIf the programmer in user space wanted to poll the device, I would assume this would be done through a system call or at least this is what I understood so far. How is this done How can a driver tell the kernel to be called upon a specific systemcall so that it can execute the request from the user And then what happens, how does the driver gives back the requested data to user spacep  pI might be completely off track here, any guidance would be appreciated. I am not looking for specific details answers, I am only trying to understand the general picture.p

Negative 2167 pIn our codebase, we have recently migrated a lot of React components to a pure flux architecture. Thus, our data flow looks almost exactly like this image provided by the Facebook team img srchttpsfacebook.github.iofluximgfluxsimplef8diagramexplained1300w.png altFlux data flowp  pOne issue were running into is that theres a lot of boilerplate code required to make a call to the server and get a result. The process is as followsp  ol liView propagates an action called something like codeGETDATAFROMSERVERcode to an action creator lets say called codeViewActionCreatorcode.li licodeViewActionCreatorcode dispatches this action, which has no payload in most cases, and then calls codeapi.retrieveDatacodeli liUpon receiving data from the server, codeapi.retrieveDatacode dispatches an action, in this case called codeSERVERDATARECEIVEDcode with the retrieved data as the payload.li liStores respond to the two actions dispatched. However, in most cases stores only do something for the second action codeSERVERDATARECEIVEDcode, since weve found that optimistic view updates are, with a few exceptions like logging in, not usually required or very helpful.li ol  pHence, my question is, is there any reason why we shouldnt have views call codeapicodes methods directly, and have those api methods dispatch actions only upon data receptionp  pAnother related issue were running into results from the use of constants, generated using httpsgithub.comSTRMLkeyMirror. We repeatedly run into an error where we forget to add a constant used in an action creator and store to our constants file, but this doesnt manifest until runtime, since our stores use switch statements to test which action theyre receiving from the dispatcher, and when we use a constant thats undefined, this simply percolates down to the end of the switch statement.p

At least our customers do.p  pSo I emdoem want djangos localization, but I want to adjust only codeDECIMALSEPARATORcode. Problem localization takes preference over simply setting codeDECIMALSEPARATOR  .code in my settings file.p  pI could add a format directory and use a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.8refsettingsformatmodulepath relnofollowFORMATMODULEPATHa, but I dislike having to copypaste such a directory into all of my django projects.p  pSo am I missing something Is there a better wayp  pSmall addition the most safe would be to emacceptem either dot or comma, as virtually nobody types in thousand separators by hand.p

Negative 2167 pSo Ive created my first node.js application.  It works great.  Its using Express, MongoDB with Mongoose, and Bunyan for logging.  Before adding MongoDBMongoose it worked fine with PM2 using pm2 start app.js i 4.  Since then Ive added the code for MongoDBMongoose.p  pIf I start my app with binwww or npm start it works fine. But since adding MongoDBMongoose when I start my app with PM2 using the same command its not workingp  pWhen I run pm2 monit or pm2 list everything looks perfectly fine.  All the apps show as online.  When I point my browser at localhost3000 I just get a connection refused.p  pIs there some PM2 log file I should be looking at  Why isnt it responding to web requests to port 3000 but the monitor and list show everything as working finep

Negative 2167 pWe have a very large and complex application that has many different components.  Some of the components are using different version of the same file. For instance, an enum A might be defined in file1.c and in file2.c. However, within each subproject, the application only uses one or the other.p  pThe problem Im having with Eclipse No matter if a file includes file1.c or file2.c, Eclipse cant resolve the enum values between the two. For some reason its looking in both files anyway and getting confused.p  pSo is there a way to get Eclipse to specifically follow the includes when trying to resolve a variable Or is it stuck scanning the entire projectp  pIn the hopes of eliminating half of the problem, I attempted to use a filter to exclude File1.c from the source. However, Eclipse still sees both. Here is a related link that I followed.  a hrefhttpswww.eclipse.orgforumsindex.phpt46022 relnofollowEclipse Forumap

In my scenario, I dont receive the GCM message please notice it is not about how to receive GCM in general like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28525967gcmpushnotificationwithandroidherea and the ActivityManager kills the app. So I wonder if I have a conceptual misunderstanding or if it is a general problem.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have an Android application that runs in foreground Activity and background Service. The application is attached to a persistent notification to make sure that the app continues to run even if the user opens the Android TaskManager and swipes the App away. The app uses a WakefulBroadcastReceiver and an IntentService to receives and processes GCM messages both are registered in the manifest file and all permissions are set. As far as I understand this was the suggested pattern by Google to process GCM messages. Similar solutions can be seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24098219backgroundserviceinandroidherea or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28251934wakefulbroadcastreceiveronreceivenottriggeringandroidgcmherea but if required I can add code examples too. I know that Google changed the Android BroadcastReceiver flow with API 3.1 e.g. a hrefhttpwww.javacodegeeks.com201205androidbroadcastreceiverchangein.html relnofollowherea. In general I am able to receive and process GCM messages if my app is in foreground or simply in background while the activity still exists.p  pstrongError scenariostrongp  ol liUser starts the applicationli liUser opens the Android task managerli liUser swipes  removes the application from the task manager notice the app service is still running in the background.

Negative 2167 pSo Ive been reading about CouchDb lately, and I REALLY like it. It seems so simple, yet flexible and I LOVE the RESTful interface. But lets face it  unless youre building a SAP, youll want your application to serve static HTML with SEOfriendly URLs rather than constant HTTP requests. I havent actually used CouchDb yet in any project, but I am keen to explore it in near future.p  pThe question is how can I use it to build a static HTML website, for example a blog I would like to store all my blog posts in CouchDb and then serve them as HTML, based on categories, tags and date. If Im understanding this correctly, I would just define a set of emshowsem in my emdesign documentsem. So for example, in a emdesign documentem for all posts in the Work category, I would also add a separate function for the emshowem template. However, I have a bit of a problem with storing my HTML inside a JavaScript function inside a JSON file Thats sounds superpainful to maintain. Ive had a quick look at CouchApp and it seems to solve this issue, but it doesnt seem to be in active development, hence my question about other possible solutions.p  pI want to be able to structure my HTML  CSS  JS as I normally would have, but leverage the benefits of CouchDB, if possible, without any external backend. Or even better  I would LOVE to actually define my emdatabasesem as JSON files, my emmapem functions as regular code.jscode files and maintain the classic directory structure for everything else, so for examplep  pcodedbdatacode  this holds CouchDBp  pcodedbmapscode  this holds my map functionsp  pcodepubliccode  this holds everything else including other JS, CSS and HTML, like thisp  precodepubliccss publicjs publiccategories.html publicposts.html publicindex.html codepre  petc.p  pAny thoughts on how can I achieve this Or if its even possiblep  pstrongBonus questionstrong could someone be so kind and explain what emreduceem functions are Are they the SQL equivalent of codesumcode and codecountcode functions When would I actually use a reduce function And when would I need to write a custom onep  pThanksp

Negative 2167 pI have a Ruby on Rails Application that stores JSON data in a MySQL database through a POST request. I also have accompanying GET routes to access the data in the database. When I first send one of the requests, either through the POST or GET route, the request takes about 1 second. When I send either the same request, or the other request, it then takes about 0.1 seconds, which is significantly faster.p  pI first thought that the SQL queries were being cached by rails, and this is why the subsequent same request was so much faster, but in the web server console, the requests were being shown again with times next to them ex. 0.3 ms and without a CACHE. In any case, even if it was caching the SQL queries, the queries for the other route are very different with only minimal similar queries, so query caching shouldnt have sped up the other query so much.p  pI read somewhere that MySQL might be caching the indexes, which makes sense why it is faster if done immediately, but if I wait an hour, it takes the same slower speed. Is the time MySQL spends accessing the uncached indexes not shown in the SQL query log, because if I add up the various 0.1 ms next to each query, it doesnt nearly add up to the overall request time even the one shown at the bottom of the log.p  pIf all of this is correct, and I am experiencing the effects of index caching and a performance penalty for accessing an index that isnt cached, is there a way I can reduce the time for this first request. My request will be sent about every hour or so, and by then the cache will no longer have my indexes. Anything for me to even look into to speed up my requests would be appreciated. p

Negative 2167 pI would like to render a sankey chart in Python using matplotlib that looks like the d3 sankey chart. The matplolib builtin sankey chart doesnt look very appealing...

So I have tried to do that. But the problem is that when I do so the div elements with the classes codesinglepageliststylecode and codesingleheadercontentstylecode end up with different heights 307px and 267px. This was the purpose of flex in the codeequalheightcode class, to give those two elements the same height and at the same time adjust height to its content, in this case both should end up with the height 307px. And that does no longer work when codeheight100code is added to all parent elements. For more details see the conversations in the comments for the answers below.

Negative 2167 pI have been working on a Python 2.7 script that accesses a Reddit account, collects all of the saved submissions, and writes them to a .xlsx workbook. Saved comments do not contain the same attributes as the submissions and throw an exception when the for loop encounters them. The program runs a tryexcept clause to catch any comments and writes all valid saved submissions to the workbook. While the program does write submissions in to the workbook properly, it only does so only for submissions that were saved before the earliest saved comment. I know that it is doing this because of the continue statement I use when an exception is encountered. However, I have tried running pass in place of the continue statement and it performs vice versa it will only write submissions to the workbook that were saved after the most recently saved comment. After researching, it seems as though that the tryexcept statement is required if I am to bypass the comments, but I am left clueless at this point. Here is a link to the code as it currently stands on BitBucketp  pa hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgjaredelliottredditsavedorgsrc5b3abc716374f4b0a042726f83716758a67a6273redditsavedorg.pyatmaster relnofollowhttpsbitbucket.orgjaredelliottredditsavedorgsrc5b3abc716374f4b0a042726f83716758a67a6273redditsavedorg.pyatmasterap  pP.S. Ignore some of the codeinprogress that is commented out. That was stuff I was working on before I encountered this issue and will be correcting later. Many thanksp  pEdit My problem has been solved. I removed the while loop and flipped the positions of the tryexcept clause and the for loop.p

Negative 2167 pIn the Pluralsight cours DomainDriven Design Fundamentals, theres an example of how the design of an Aggregate takes shape.  The example involves patient Appointments in a clinic. The appointment has relations e.g. to a doctor, or an exam room. And the example is preceded by an analysis concluding that Appointment should not be an aggregate root to Doctor and ExamRoom. And one step in the design evolution is going from the Appointment having object references to  Doctor and ExamRoom objects, to holding primitive ids of these other entities, DoctorId and ExamRoomId.  They motivate this change by saying  By simply including the ids of the related concepts rather than object references were able to ensure that creating and changing Appointment has a minimal impact on our system when we persist our Appointmentp  pMy first question Is this a common design pattern If I understand it correctly it would generalise to something like If object A relates to object B, but operating on A should never entail making changes on B, then reference it by its id, not by B itself. Is this something you would recommendp  pMy second question Has this anything to do with DDD I mean the fact that Appointment should not be an aggregate root of doctor, doesnt mean that it cant hold object references to it, or am I missing somethingp

But unfortunately i am not able to achieve it.  index.xhtml p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN      httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt  lthtml

Negative 2167 pMy client has a Flash audio player on their website and wants the WebView in the app Im creating to play the audio. My understanding is that Flash would have to be installed separately on the phone for the app or any browser to support this. p  pFor the sake of asking, is there a way to deploy Flash emwithem my app I dont even know how big of a package that would be... p  pTo be clear, I think this is kind of dumb, but I have to ask in case my client refuses to migrate from Flash.

Negative 2167 pI implemented a modified version of the a hrefhttpsgithub.comBVLCcaffeblobmasterexamplescppclassificationclassification.cpp relnofollowCaffe C examplea and while it works really well, its incredibly slow because it only accepts images one by one. Ideally Id like to pass Caffe a vector of 200 images and return the best prediction for each one. I received some a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopiccaffeusersohehSXxDR8 relnofollowgreat help from Fanglin Wanga and implemented some of his recommendations, but am still having some trouble working out how to retrieve the best result from each image. p  pThe Classify method is now passed a vector of codecvMatcode objects variable codeinputchannelscode which is a vector of grayscale floating point images. Ive eliminated the preprocessing method in the code because I dont need to convert these images to floating point or subtract the mean image. Ive also been trying to get rid of the codeNcode variable because I only want to return the top prediction and probability for each image.p  precodeinclude Classifier.h using namespace caffe using stdstring  ClassifierClassifierconst stringamp modelfile, const stringamp trainedfile, const stringamp labelfile  ifdef CPUONLY   CaffesetmodeCaffeCPU else   CaffesetmodeCaffeGPU endif     Load the network.    net.resetnew Netltfloatgtmodelfile, TEST   netgtCopyTrainedLayersFromtrainedfile    Blobltfloatgt inputlayer  netgtinputblobs[0]   numchannels  inputlayergtchannels   inputgeometry  cvSizeinputlayergtwidth, inputlayergtheight     Load labels.    stdifstream labelslabelfile.cstr   CHECKlabels ltlt Unable to open labels file  ltlt labelfile   string line   while stdgetlinelabels, line     labels.pushbackstringline    Blobltfloatgt outputlayer  netgtoutputblobs[0]   CHECKEQlabels.size, outputlayergtchannels     ltlt Number of labels is different from the output layer dimension.   static bool PairCompareconst stdpairltfloat, intgtamp lhs, const stdpairltfloat, intgtamp rhs    return lhs.first gt rhs.first    Return the indices of the top N values of vector v.  static stdvectorltintgt Argmaxconst stdvectorltfloatgtamp v, int N    stdvectorltstdpairltfloat, intgt gt pairs   for sizet i  0 i lt v.size i     pairs.pushbackstdmakepairv[i], i   stdpartialsortpairs.begin, pairs.begin  N, pairs.end, PairCompare    stdvectorltintgt result   for int i  0 i lt N i     result.pushbackpairs[i].second   return result    Return the top N predictions.  stdvectorltPredictiongt ClassifierClassifyconst stdvectorltcvMatgt ampinputchannels    stdvectorltfloatgt output  Predictinputchannels      stdvectorltintgt maxN  Argmaxoutput, 1     int idx  maxN[0]     predictions.pushbackstdmakepairlabels[idx], output[idx]     return predictions   stdvectorltfloatgt ClassifierPredictconst stdvectorltcvMatgt ampinputchannels, int numimages    Blobltfloatgt inputlayer  netgtinputblobs[0]   inputlayergtReshapenumimages, numchannels,                        inputgeometry.height, inputgeometry.width    Forward dimension change to all layers.    netgtReshape    WrapInputLayerampinputchannels    netgtForwardPrefilled     Copy the output layer to a stdvector    Blobltfloatgt outputlayer  netgtoutputblobs[0]   const float begin  outputlayergtcpudata   const float end  begin  numimages  outputlayergtchannels   return stdvectorltfloatgtbegin, end    Wrap the input layer of the network in separate cvMat objects one per channel.
