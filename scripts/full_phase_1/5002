I obviously cant delete the tables and just repopulate them as it is a somewhat lengthy process.p  pIve considered just a big transaction where I DELETE FROM all of the tables and just regenerate them.  I get a little concerned about the length of the transaction dont know yet but it could take an hour or so.p  pI wanted to create temp table replicas of all of the tables and populate those instead.  Then I could DROP the main tables and rename the temp tables.  However you cant do the DROP and ALTER table statements within a transaction as they always do an auto commit.  This should be able to be done quickly four DROP and and four ALTER TABLE statements, but it cant guarantee that a user wont get an error within that short period of time.p  pNow, a combination of the two ideas, Im considering doing the temp tables, then doing a DELETE FROM on all four original tables and then and INSERT INTO from the temp tables to repopulate the main tables.  Since there are no DDL statements here, this would all work within a transaction.  Then, however, I wondering if the memory it takes to process some 60 million records within a transaction is going to get me in trouble this would be a concern for the first idea as well.p  pI would think this would be a common scenario.  Is there a standard or recommended way of doing this  Any tips would be appreciated.  Thanks.p
Negative 5002 pI am creating an application for the iPhone which involves having buttons which animate a image view, I created another view in which the buttons are held, however I would like to be able to  horizontally or vertically, scroll this view of buttons. I have looked into adding scroll views and I have even followed a tutorial, But I just cant figure out how to add it to my app. Any Ideas anyone In the tutorial I followed the guy adds the scroll view to the MainWindow.xib, now my app is created and designed in the viewcontroller.xib. So after following the tutorial when I hit build and go it loads that nib and all you see is a white background and a scroll view. also in that tutorial he scrolled an image where as i would like to scroll a long view of buttons I realize the newbieness of my question could be crazy, but Im new to programming all together. Heres another additional question, if some one helped me get this scroll view working where would you design the contents of that scrolled view if its length is longer than the iphone screen Because It is my understanding that the space to design with in interface builder is the size of the iphone screen and designing interfaces longer than the iphone screen isnt doable. of course i know it is doable i just dont know how to do it Any help will be appreciated.p

Negative 5002 pI want to include caching in my app design. Caching templates for starters.p  pThe design I have used so far is very modular. I have created an ORM implementation for allp  pmy tables and each table is represented by the corresponding class.p  pAll the requests are handled by one controller which routes them to the appropriate webmethod functions.p  pI am using a template class for handling UI parts. p  pWhat I have in mind for caching includes the implementation of a separate Cache class for handling caching with thep  pflexibility to either store in files, apc or memcache. Right now I am testing with file caching.p  pSome thoughtsp  ol liShould I include the logic of checking for cached versions in the Template class or li ol  pin the webmethods which handle the incoming requests and which eventually call the Template class.p  pIn the first case, things are pretty simple as I will not have to change anything more than pass the template classp  pan extra argument whether to load from cache or not.p  pIn the second case however, I am thinking of checking for a cached version immediately in the webmethod and if found return it. This will save all the processing done until the logic reaches the template first case senario. p  pBoth senarios however, rely on an accurate mechanism of invalidating caches, which brings as to p  ol lipInvalidating cachesp  pAs I see it and you can add your input freely a template cached file, becomes invalidate ifp  pa. the expiration set, is reached.p  pb. the template file itself is updated ie by the developer when adding a new linep  pc. the webmethod that handles the request changes ie the developer addsdeletes something in the codep  pd. content coming from the db and ending in the template file is modifiedp  pI am thinking of storing a json encoded array inside the cached file. The first value will be the expiration timestamp of the cache. The second value will be the modification time of the php file with the code handling the request to cope with option c above The third will be the content itselfp  pThe validation process I am considering, according to the above senarios,  isp  pa. If the expiration of the cached file stored in the array is reached, delete the cache filep  pb. if the cached files mod time is smaller than the templates skeleton file mod time, delete the cached filep  pc. if the mod time of the php file is greated than the one stored in the cache, delete the cached file.p  pd. This is tricky. In the ORM implementation I ahve added event handlers which fire when adding, updating, deleting objects.  I could delete the cache file every time an object thatprovides content to the template, is modified.p  pThe problem is how to keep track which cached files correpond to each schema object.p  pTake this example, a user has his shortprofile page and a full profile page 2 templatesp  pThese templates can be cached. Now, every time the user modifies his profile, the event handler would need to know whichp  ptemplates or cached files correspond to the User, so that these files can be deleted.

Negative 5002 pI am trying to make my own Jabber bot but i have run into a little trouble.  I have gotten my bot to respond to messages, however, if I try to change the bots presence then it seems as though all of the messages you send to the bot get delayed.  p  pWhat I mean is when I run the script I change the presence so I can see that it is online.  Then when I send it a message it takes three before the callback subroutine I have set up for messages gets called.  After the thirrd message is sent and the chat subroutine is called it still process the first message I sent.  p  pThis really doesnt pose too much of a problem except that I have it set up to log out when I send the message logout and it has to be followed by two more messages in order to log out.

Negative 5002 pWe are using JMX for communication between different EARs on the same Websphere application server 6.1. All works well if we only use Java types as arguments, but if we use our own classes as arguments the problem is that we get ClassCastExceptions on the receiver side. This is obviously a classloader problem if the jar with the argument types is put into the JRE endorsed directory, such that all classloaders use exactly the same class, the exceptions disappear. But we would much prefer to put the library that defines the argument types in the EAR itself.p  pNow my question is there a trick to persuade WAS to serialize and deserialize the arguments during the JMX call I guess in this case the ClassCastException would dissappear.p

Negative 5002 pNot sure if this should be CW or not, youre welcome to comment if you think it should be.p  pAt my workplace, we have many many different file formats for all kinds of purposes. Most, if not all, of these file formats are just written in plain text, with no consistency. Im only a student working parttime, and I have no experience with using xml in production, but it seems to me that using xml would improve productivity, as we often need to parse, check and compare these outputs.p  pSo my questions are given that I can only control one small application and its output only  the inputs are formats that are used in other applications as well, is it worth trying to change the output to be xmlbased If so, what are the best known ways to do that in C i.e., xml parserswriters, etc. Also, should I also provide a plaintext output to make it easy for the users which are also programmers to get used to xml Should I provide a script to translate xmlplaintext What are your experiences with this subjectp  pThanks.p

Negative 5002 pI made a XY plot that shows points from one data set in two different colors, depending on a set of conditions. I achieved this by making the source table three columns instead of two.

Negative 5002 pI am developing a Java Program, I have 2 different classes that need to share variables with each other. So for this purpose I created a third class, which contains these shared variables. Basically, first class has its own flag in this third class, and second class has its own flag in this third class. And I add extend ThirdClass to other classes definition, of course.p  pMy problem is when I change the value of first class flag in the first class main method, second class is not able to see this change. Namely, it sees the flag with inital value.p  pI think this is about static variables. But I do not know the solution. p  pActually, I have two servers and multi clients. I am trying to simulate differenet situations of these servers for my distributed systems course. Each server has its own data table that is synchronized with other. By simulation, I mean server may be down or up, and when client try to reach down server I need to direct it to other server. So, between clients and servers I need to send information.p  pHow can I share variables between two classes, and easily modify these variables by any class without loss of previous modifications p  pThank you.p

Negative 5002 pSuppose I have three functions doA, doB, and doC in a C program where I know that doA will call doB which in turn calls doC.  p  pSince doC has to interact with a database, I know that it could very well generate exceptions that it wont be able to resolve that need to be brought to the users attention.  At the moment, I have the code which might throw the error in a try  catch blow in doC and then the call to doC in doB in another try  catch and similarly the call to doB in doA in try  catch block.  This allows me to just use throw to kick the exception up to doA where something can reasonably be done to display this to the user.  p  pThis seems a little like overkill though.  I am wondering if since I dont plan on dealing with the exception in doB or doC if I can just get rid of the try  catch blocks there.  p  pAssuming there are no finally blocks involved, what is the best practice for dealing with situations like this  p

Negative 5002 pI am running a Magento ecommerce installation which runs on PHPMySQL on a testing server.   I have a fairly large from what Ive read querycachesize of 272,629,760 bytes and it works great.p  pThe site runs lightning fast once most of the queries are loaded into the query cache, as fast as the fastest production sites other than perhaps Google.com or Amazon.com.  But the problem I have is that in order to load all of those queries into the query cache I have to manually click through 100s of links on the site.  Every time you click a link, a query is sent to the database and saved in the cache.  But if I restart the server, then I have to do that all over again.  There must be a better wayp  pIdeally, I think there should just be a way to backup the query cache before restart and load it upon restart.  Is this possiblep  pOtherwise, im just going to have to design a web crawler that automatically clicks all my links.p

Negative 5002 pI am developing a WPF application using the MVVM pattern as described by Josh Smith in the article at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd419663.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd419663.aspxa.p  pI cant figure out a good way of reacting to Convert Back errors for example when a user types a letter in a textbox bound to a double.p  pJosh Smith proposes a Validation system where the Model validates its own values and presents the boolean result through SomeModel.IsValid. Josh then uses the value of IsValid as predicate for certain buttons, e.g. a Save button on a form  if the form has not been validly completed, IsValid is false and the Save button is disabled.p  pThis method works really well. However, when a user types a value in a textbox that cannot be converted, a ConvertBack error occurs. The ViewModels setter for the property is never called, and thus the Models property is never updated. IsValid remains true. Although the View responds to the Validation error by showing an error message and highlighting the error or whatever the setting may be, the Save button remains active, as the IsValid property of the Model is still true, as the Model has not been updated.p  pAre there any MVVM users who have experienced this same challenge Any ideasp  pOne suggestion is that the property on the model could be Nullable. Then the Converter should set the source to Null if the user enters nonconvertable date such as a letter in a textbox bound to a double. However, I could not find a simple way of doing this  it seems to require writing custom converters for every data type I require the functionality for, and for every number format I require it in. This is a very poor sollution to what seems like a design challange.p  pAny ideasp

The only way the apps write their log files is if Im logged into the server as the local Administrator user or if I right click and run IE as Run as Administrator, neither of which is an acceptable solution for us.p  pOur platform is Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 UAC setting is the default setting IIS7.5 ASP.NET 4.0 using Windows authentication and impersonation, both on in web.configp  pOur app gets installed to D[appname]     [appnameWebSite] all the .aspx, .dll, etc. files are in here     Log the app tries to write the log file to this folderp  pOn the server Created new App Pool name [appname], .NET 4.0, Managed Pipeline Mode Classic, Identity ApplicationPoolIdentity, Load User Profile False, all other properties are the defaults Created IIS application pointing to D[appname][appnameWebSite] and added it the the new App Pool Full trust level Have a domain user in local Administrators groupp  pWith all the configuration and default settings listed above, the ASP.NET app will not write the log file.  The app appears to work fine in the browser, but no log.txt file.p  pTo try to fix this issues, weve tried many things Tried Application Pool setting Managed Pipeline Mode Integrated Tried Application Pool setting Identity NetworkService Tried Application Pool setting Identity LocalSystem Tried Application Pool setting Load User Profile True Gave Users group full control to file system for our application folder structure tried appname folder, tried Log folder only, tried appnameWebSite and Log folders only Gave IIS AppPool[appname] matching the new App Pool user full control to file system for our application folder structure tried appname folder, tried Log folder only, tried appnameWebSite and Log folders onlyp  pNone of these things helped.  Again, the app would run fine, just no log file created.p  pAs mentioned above, the only way that the log file is created when the app runs is if we log into the server using the local Administrator account which makes sense since hes a super user or if we run IE as administrator and elevate privileges.p  pAny suggestions  Help  Questionsp  pThanksp

Negative 5002 pIve a tomcat application with jsf 1.1p  pCase My application has a jsp let name it create.jsp that contains a form to create a Business Object imagine type person. One of the attributes of this Business Object is a relation to itself the BO person, has an attribute father, that is also of type person. For this porpose, in the jsp, I have a selectable, and a button. The button enables to create new Business Object in this case, a person. Therefore, the jsp show in the popup is the same that the one shown in the main windowp  pProblem Im facing wrong behaviours in the main window.p  pCause Ive studied the case, and the reason of the problem is the ids of the views stored in the server. When the users requires a new page, the server creates a view ViewRoot and stores it at the session. The jsp path is used as the id of the View. When the user submits a form, it will rehuse the same view stored in the session. The problem in my case is that the popup ViewRoot, and the main window ViewRoot share the same id. So when the main window is shown, its viewRoot will be stored let say id create.jsp, but, when the popup is shown, its viewRoot will overwrite the main one in session. After closing the popup, the user will try to submit the main page, but in the server, there is no such a ViewRoot.p  pPossible Solution Ive been thinking on changing the ViewRoot id creation, but I thing that this is not feasible at least if I dont modify the jsf library.p  pOLD TEXT I have a jsp with a form let name it create.jsp, that opens a popup window. This popup will also use create.jsp . Due to that JSF viewid, is fomed by the jsp path, both pages will share same id. So when the popup is displayed, the view stored in the session for the main page is overwritten by the new one. Because of this, the application is not working properly.p  pIs there any way to change the ids of the views anyone has any solutionp  pThanksp

Negative 5002 pI will try to explain my problem in detail. Feel free to ask if you need more details.p  pI have a multiclientserver connection threaded by Java sockets. All the exchanges operate according to the protocol on a simple case by case basis.

Negative 5002 pI had a huge load on my servers yesterday, and, even if I worked on optimizing the performances before I had a similar problem about 2 months ago, my servers couldnt handle the load I have a service which had about 50 account creations per minute.p  pFinally, my servers handled the load because I changed the instances  I am on Amazon EC2, and I was using a load balancer with 20 micro instances. It was not enough. I finally changed to 10 large instances, and that was OK. But, you know, large instances are kinda expensive, and I cant afford to have so much large instances now, because there is less load, I have only 5 large instances running, but it is also too much.p  pSo, I am still working on the optimization and the server configuration, but I am stuck on a point.p  pSo far, I am using symfony with memcached. It works fine, everything that should be cached is cached, etc.p  pNow, I want to add a Varnish in front of my apache web server.p  pI did so, and I configured it  I think  well, and it is running now. The problem is that there is no hit on the cache.p  pFrom what I saw, the problem is that the HTTP headers sent by symfony are not set correctly. For example, for a cached request, I have the following headers p  precode    Expires Thu, 19 Nov 1981 085200 GMT     CacheControl nostore, nocache, mustrevalidate, postcheck0, precheck0     Pragma nocache codepre  pThe module is correctly configured to use cache, etc., but I just cant find where I can set the correct HTTP headers. I know how to set a cache header in symfony for a specific action, but clearly, I dont want to do it on every action by the way, even if I did that, I think that this is not the right way.p  pSo Im asking how can I use Varnish with symfony 1.4 From what I saw, there are two possibilities p  ul liI set correctly the HTTP headers sent by symfonyli liI configure Varnish to handle correctly the default HTTP headers sent by symfonyli ul  pDo you know how can I fix either one of the problems p  pThanks,p  pN.B.  I am on Varnish3p

Negative 5002 pdo you know if the following statement is guaranteed to be true by one of the fortran 90952003 standards Suppose a read statement for a character variable is given a blank line i.e., containing only white spaces and new line characters. If the format specifier is an asterisk , it continues to read the subsequent lines until a nonblank line is found.

Negative 5002 pIn Linux, I am trying to debug the C code of a shared library which is loaded from Python code. The loading is done using the codectypescode package.

Negative 5002 pI was revisting some code I wrote a long time ago, and decided to rewrite it to better make use of threads and better use of programming in general...p  pIt is located here a hrefhttpsgithub.combuddhabrotbuddhabrotblobmasterbasic.c relnofollowhttpsgithub.combuddhabrotbuddhabrotblobmasterbasic.ca p  pIt is an application that renders a buddhabrot fractal. For reasons out of the scope of this question it is hard to use memoization to optimize this, and basically if youd profile this, over 99 of the time is spent in the innermost loop that eventually doesp  precodebuddhabrot[col][row] codepre  pMultiple threads will execute this code. Since incrementing is not threadsafe, I used a specific mutex lock around this part of the memory. So, each addressable location in the buddhabrot memory has a separate mutex.p  pNow, this is more efficient than using one lock of course which would definitely make all the threads wait for each other, but it is less memory efficient it appears the mutexes take some data as well. I am also wondering about other repercussions in the pthreads implementations with millions of mutexesp  pI now have two other strategies to considerp  ul lipUse a less dense set of mutex locks, for each region in the map. So, a lock for [col16][row16], for instance, would only lock a thread if it visits the same region of 16 pixels as another one. The density of the locks could be dynamically adjusted.  But as I was modeling this I was wondering if Im not solving an existing problem that might even be implemented by kernels, and I also cant really find a way to make this without slowing things down. I also thought about trees of mutexes, but all of this is just too slow inside this loop to give an indication, after optimizating the order of some maths operations behind the compilers back I could squeeze out about 30 more processor time. Is there a topic for this, how do I look for mor einformation on mutex density planning..pli lipCopy the memory for each thread so I dont even have to mutex around it. But this is even more memoryinefficient. It would solve the problem of having millions of mutexes without knowing the repercussions thereof.pli ul  pSo, is there anything else, anything better I could do p

Negative 5002 pI have some code that works with ExpandoObjects populated by database calls.  Invariably some of the values are nulls.  When I look at the objects as an ExpandoObject, I see all the keys and values nulls included in the underlying dictionary.  But if I try to access them through a dynamic reference, any key that has a corresponding null value does not show up in the dynamic view of the object. I get an ArgumentNullException when I try to access it via property syntax on the dynamic reference.p  pI know I could work around this by working directly with an ExpandoObject, adding a bunch of try catches, mapping the expando to a concrete type, etc., but that kind of defeats the purpose of having this dynamic object in the first place.  The code that consumes the dyanmic object would work fine if some of the properties had null values.

Set a breakppoint and look at the quickwatch on the dynamicRef vs.  the expandoRef to see why I let myself be led astray.

Negative 5002 pI am building a desktop JavaFX 2.0 application that needs to interact with a card reader over the serial port.  So I am using the RxTx library version 2.17r2 32bit.p  pTo do some initial testinglearning I built out the RxTx functionality in a java console app and got that working great, by following the instructions to copy over the native DLLs and the  jar file into my various 32bit JDK version jdk1.7.004 directories.p  pI then created a JavaFX app with a primitive UI and started to migrate the RxTx code over to this new project.  This JavaFX app is pointing at the same 32bit JDK that I used for my console app.p  pThe JavaFX app locates the jar file perfectly as I can import gnu.io. and then write code that is correctly recognized by NetBeans, as well as JavaDocs, autocomplete etc.  Unfortunately on execution it returns the following errors, which look suspiciously like the native DLLs arent being locatedp  precodeException in Application start method java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0Native Method     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invokeNativeMethodAccessorImpl.java57     at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invokeDelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java43     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java601     at com.javafx.main.Main.launchAppMain.java486     at com.javafx.main.Main.mainMain.java638 Caused by java.lang.RuntimeException Exception in Application start method     at com.sun.javafx.application.LauncherImpl.launchApplication1Unknown Source     at com.sun.javafx.application.LauncherImpl.access000Unknown Source     at com.sun.javafx.application.LauncherImpl1.runUnknown Source     at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java722 Caused by java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError gnuioCommPortIdentifier     at testfxscreens.TestFXScreens.setupSerialPortTestFXScreens.java186     at testfxscreens.TestFXScreens.startTestFXScreens.java61     at com.sun.javafx.application.LauncherImpl5.runUnknown Source     at com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl4.runUnknown Source     at com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl3.runUnknown Source     at com.sun.glass.ui.win.WinApplication.runLoopNative Method     at com.sun.glass.ui.win.WinApplication.access100Unknown Source     at com.sun.glass.ui.win.WinApplication21.runUnknown Source     ... 1 more Caused by java.lang.ClassNotFoundException gnu.io.CommPortIdentifier     at java.net.URLClassLoader1.runURLClassLoader.java366     at java.net.URLClassLoader1.runURLClassLoader.java355     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method     at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClassURLClassLoader.java354     at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java423     at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java356     ... 9 more codepre  pI looked at the RxTx homepage and found an example solution to the above error, but it simply mentions that you likely dont have the DLLs and JAR files in your JDK correctly.p  pThis is really odd as Im able to get the console app, using the same JDK directories, working perfectly.

Negative 5002 pIm using Django to send iOS push notifications.  To do that, I need to access a .pem certificate file currently stored on the server in my app directory along with views.py, models.py, admin.py, etc.  When I try to send a push notification from a python shell on the server, everything works fine.  But when I try to send a push notification by accessing a Django view, it doesnt send and gives me an SSLError.

Negative 5002 pI am having performance issues when dealing with pagination and filtering products as seen on many ecommerce sites, here is an example from Zapposp  pKind of the standard br Showing 110 of 132 results. [prev] 1 2 [3] 4 ... 13 [next]br [10] Results per pagep  pTo me it seems like a large part of the problem is the query is run twice, once to count the number of results and again to actually populate the array. Below is the filter queryp  precodeSELECT productid, producttitle, orderable FROM tableview WHERE familytitle  Shirts OR categorytitle  Shirts AND detailvalue  Blue AND detailtitle  Color OR detailvalue  XL AND detailtitle  Size GROUP BY productid, producttitle, orderable HAVING COUNTdetailtitle2 ORDER BY productid LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0 codepre  pThe query takes about 20ms to run just by itself. The table it is selecting from is a view which is a join of about five different tables. The parameters that are passed in by the user are the detailvalue amp detailtitle which are the filtering criterial. The family amp category and then the Limit is set by the results per page. So if they want to view all the results the limit is set to 2000. And every time they go to a new page via the pagination the whole query is run again. Below is a snippet of the PHP, products is an array of the query results. And then the numberofresults is a count of the same thing with the maximum limit.p  precodeproducts  filtervalue, categorytitle, numberperpage, subcategory, startnumber  numberofresults  countfiltervalue, categorytitle, 2000, subcategory, 0  pages  ceilnumberofresults  numberperpage codepre  pWhen run on my local machine the results page takes about 600800ms to load, when deployed to Heroku the page takes 1316 seconds to load. Ive left out a lot of the PHP code, but Im using PHPs PDO class to make the query results into an object to display in PHP. The tables being joined are the product table, category table, detail table, and the two tables linking them via foreign keys.p  pGoogle results show that this is a pretty commoncomplex problem, but I have yet to come across any real solution that works for me.p

Negative 5002 pWithin PHP classes the parser deals with the codeconstructcode and codedestructcode methods to instantiate the instance and destroy it when the script exits or you use unset.  When you extend a class you simply use codeparentconstructcode and codeparentdestructcode to run any cleanup code that might need running on the class that was extended.p  pNow within the context of a class that represents DB data and helps you manipulate that data Id thought that a codedestructcode method could be used to compare current values against the originals grabbed from the DB and do an UPDATE when necessary in some cases just always do an UPDATE so long as the Primary Key value cannot be changed.  Implementing this in PHP is pretty straight forward.p  pThe main upside to this approach would be to simply manipulate class variables quickly as needed and then have the class do one big UPDATE at the end.  In long scripts that run for minutes it might be nice to create DB instance during construct, get the data, close the DB connection, and then manipulate class variables only during the minutes long execution.  On destruct, open up a new DB connection make the UPDATEs and then close down the DB connection and clean up anything else that needs cleaning up.p  pIm curious what peoples thoughts are on whether or not this is a good ideabad practice but my main question was is this possible in Ruby.p  pIn Ruby you have the initialize method that runs when you instantiate an instance of the class.  The Ruby equivalent of codeparentconstructcode is codesupercode in Ruby. And there is the codeObjectSpace.definefinalizecode and codefinalizecode method for Ruby classes.  However, as I understand it, the finalize method isnt supposed to be able to reference the instance calling it.  On top of that I cant find any equivalent to codeparentdestructcode. I suspect thats because there isnt an equivalent since it seems that the codefinalizecode method was explicitly designed to prevent referencing itself.p  pAnyone out there know of way to do this If not, whats the best practice for dumping Ruby classes to get back resources and prevent data loss Does everyone have a garbagecollection method they call just before setting a class instance to nil or is there some other wayp  pThanksp

Negative 5002 pI am using visual studio 2008 to build an app that has 40 projects. We also link agains some 3rd party libs, which I suspect is causing my headache.  When I build in release it runs fine.  When I try to make a debug build and run in the VS debugger, it wont run because of the familiar sidbyside assembly error.  I tried copying the contents of DebugNonRedist from a system that had 2005 installed and can run in debug as a temporary fix, but that didnt work. I would like to find out which library requires the 2005 redist crt, but I dont know how to go about doing that. I tried using depends.exe on the debug executable, but it gives no new information.  How can I find out where the dependency for the vc8 debug runtime is coming from  Thanks.p  pJosephp

Negative 5002 pIm kind of stuck on the logic behind an SDL2 texture. To me, they are pointless since you cannot draw to them.p  pIn my program, I have several surfaces or what emwereem surfaces before I switched to SDL2 that I just blitted together to form layers. Now, it seems, I have to create several renderers and textures to create the same effect since codeSDLRenderCopycode takes a texture pointer.p  pNot only that, but emallem renderers have to come from a window, which I understand, but still fouls me up a bit more.p  pThis all seems extremely bulky and slow. Am I missing something Is there a way to draw directly to a texture What are the point of textures, and am I safe to have multiple if not hundreds of renderers in place of what were surfacesp
Negative 5002 pLets say I have two local smart pointers, codefoocode and codebarcode.p  precodesharedptrltFoogt foo  ... sharedptrltBargt bar  ... codepre  pThese smart pointers are wrappers around resources that for some reason must be destructed in the order codefoocode, then codebarcode.p  pNow I want to create a lambda that uses codefoocode and codebarcode, but outlives the scope containing them. So Id capture them by value, like thisp  precodeauto lambda  [foo, bar]  ...  codepre  pThis creates copies of codefoocode and codebarcode within the function object.

Negative 5002 pI agree with Tom Kyte about full table scan is not an evil a hrefhttpasktom.oracle.complsapexfp1001103a3a3a3aP11QUESTIONID9422487749968 relnofollowsourcea, but only when a table is relatively small. So, having additional index of such a table is redundant. However, a table with 100.000 records should not be considered as small but explain plan from such a table shows performed table full scan.

Do we have always to execute DBMSSTATS.GATHERTABLESTATS at least at start to tell Oracle to use the best querying approachp

Negative 5002 pIve been struggling with this issue for days, so I hope someone can help me out... I have a grouped UITableView with several cells. I want to draw some custom graphics above the UITableView that would scroll with the content of the table. Specifically, I want to draw a line with dots, joining the UITableViewCells across the sections like thisbr img srchttpi46.tinypic.com21dpwmd.gif altScreenshotp  pOf course if we have more cells than what the screen is capable of displaying, the upper layer with the custom drawing should move with the underlaying cells.  Ive tried to subclass UITableView and override its drawRect method, but it didnt work. Even if I wouldnt call [super drawRectrect], the table content displayed without problem. Ive tried to add a new subview to the UITableView, but it changes its size dynamically when it gets the cells and sections from its datasource... Im out of ideas... p  pAlthough the Web is full of custom UITableViewCell samples, I havent managed to find anything similiar to my concept...p  pCan anyone help me how to achieve the above mentioned feature p

Negative 5002 pI am using codesqlitecode in ObjectiveC via the C API.  One of the intended features of my app is that the user can search for a person name and with each new character they enter, an SQL query using codeLIKEcode is executed to find all people whose names qualify as a match.  The issue I am running into is parameterizing the match inside the LIKE, without the question mark being interpreted literally.  That is, I believe the app at present is looking for peoples names that include codecode in them which is nobody.p  pMy code looks like thisp  precodeconst char sql  SELECT rowid, name, email FROM person WHERE name LIKE  sqlite3stmt sqlStatement ifsqlite3preparev2db, sql, 1, ampsqlStatement, NULL  SQLITEOK      NSLogProblem preparing getFilteredPeopleStubs statement.  ifsqlite3bindtextsqlStatement, 1, [searchText UTF8String], 1, SQLITETRANSIENT  SQLITEOK     NSLogProblem binding search text param.  codepre  pBasically, codesearchTextcode is where I emwantem the name to be coming from, but at the moment I believe it is just searching for people whose name contains codecode, because of the single quotations in codecode.  Is there a solution to this problem that still lets me use a parameterized query protection against SQL injection and achieves what I am afterp

Negative 5002 pPicture a normal invoice On it, you have several items. Each item has a quantity and a price per unit, among other things unit and description.p  pThe total amount for each item is calculated like this quantity  price per unit. This is done for each item. Then, the overall invoices net amount is the sum of all the totals. Add VAT, and you have the invoices gross amount.p  pThis is what I am trying to do with my Rails app. An invoice has many items and accepts nested attributes for them. Generally, this all works fine.p  pFollowing the logic, all I need to enter in manually is the price per unit and the quantity for each item as well as the invoices VAT.

The images display correctly based on the Uri list, strongthe issue is the order of the ListltUrigt is sometimes incorrectstrong. It is important to my users that the images appear in the same order they select them in. p  pstrongClarificationstrong When I use the term Gallery I am referring to the built in Android app Gallery.  When I use the term Share I am referring to the the Share button within the Gallery app. This allows the user to select from a list of services such as Facebook, Email, and in this case my app. p  pFor Example imagine a Gallery with 3 images, displayed in an arbitrary order A, B, and C. The user selects first C then A then B and chooses to share them with my app. On most phones my list will be correctly ordered C, A, B, on offending phones this order seems random. p  pI cannot use the creation timestamp because the creation time is generally irrelevant to the selection order. Adding custom meta data doesnt help either because I dont know the correct initial order.  p

Negative 5002 pI have an issue where overlapping child windows are not being painted correctly when one window is updated below another window that has the WSEXTRANSPARENT style.p  pThe parent window has two children, W1 and W2, that overlap with W1 being above W2 in the zorder. W1 has the extended style WSEXTRANSPARENT. The issue is that when W2 paints in its client area Im testing this by invalidating W2, the W2 entirely paints over the overlapping portion of W1. If the parent is redrawn then both overlapping children are drawn in the correct order.p  pThe child windows are drawn correctly when WSCLIPSIBLINGS is set on W2 and WSEXTRANSPARENT is removed from W1. If W2s client area is invalidated in this situation, it paints but does not draw over the portion obscured by W1.p  pWSEXTRANSPARENT is being used because the first child window is being used as an overlay for the second child window, and I would like to avoid having mouse clicks blocked by the overlay.p  pIs there a way to have overlapping windows draw correctly with the WSEXTRANSPARENT style or can I get the same behavior using some sort of workaroundp

Negative 5002 pIve read a hrefhttpwww.nobugs.orgdeveloperwin32debugcrtheap.html relnofollowhttpwww.nobugs.orgdeveloperwin32debugcrtheap.htmla, that HeapAlloc allocates some memory for bookkeeping in addition to the memory block requested. The size of bookkeeping info should be 40 bytes 8 bytes before the block and 32 after.p  pHowever, when I run a test with my VS2010, the actual memory consumed turns out to be significantly less. For example, I insert 1M ints into a set. I wrote a hook function for malloc to make sure that every insertion triggers a separate dynamic memory allocation request to construct a new node. One node, according to hook, takes 20 bytes. If we add 80 bytes overhead, the total memory for one node should be 100 bytes. That is the set should consume  100 megs, while according to TaskManager it takes as little as 32 megs.p  pTherefore, I have following questionsp  pIs the overhead really 40 bytes Does the overhead apply to every HeapAlloced blockp

Negative 5002 pIm using RavenDB on a project that is currently in development so has no users yet. My background has always been relational databases until this project but I much prefer the NoSQL approach in general. However, I dont yet have any experience of working on or managing a site built atop a NoSQL database that gets heavy traffic. Im starting to get an understanding of MapReduce indexes and have included some within my solution but am wonderingp  pstrongAre there any design rules of thumb that I should be following about when to create MapReduce indexes and when not tostrong p  pI know that it is very dependent upon the business objects I have in my system and how they interact with each other. I guess Im just struggling to see the big picture about which queries I might be making that should use an index, and which I can simply query the objects for directly. p  pHeres a quick overview of parts of my business domain and where Ive created indexes alreadyp  pMy system consists primarily of brands and consumers. Each of those has many social media accounts. When a user signs in via their social media account, I have indexes, codeBrandsBySocialAccountcode and codeConsumersBySocialAccountcode, which flatten those collections and associate them with the codeUserIdcode of the brand or consumer. Once I have the codeUserIdcode I can then retrieve the relevant brand or consumer record and away I go. p  pA brand can create many campaigns. I have another index here, codeCampaignsByBrandcode. Theres also a requirement for tracking how consumers interact with campaigns, so campaigns can have many tracking entries for the different interactions they can perform with a campaign. They can follow a link to a campaign page externally or discover one from within the site itself for example. As I explain this it seems clear that I need indexes here. Either I have an index per interaction codeClickLinkTrackingEntriesByCampaigncode and codeViewDetailsTrackingEntriesByCampaigncode or one index codeTrackingEntriesByCampaigncode that contains the interaction. Is multiple indexes overkill here It may be. There are currently 4 types of interaction and there may be others introduced later. These queries are very quick when I have a few records. But will they still be as quick as they can be when there are hundreds of thousands or even millions of records p  pLooking at the overall design, it seems that, for every object that has a collection property that might need to be queried by a property on that collection, I should create MapReduce indexes. Is that a good rule of thumb to follow Are there others  if you have these types of object interactions you should be thinking about creating these kind of indexesp

Negative 5002 pAfter the app receives a push notification, Id like to change titles of some buttons on my main codeViewControllercode. To achieve this behavior, I overwrote in my app delegate the method codeapplication didReceiveRemoteNotificationcode to reinstantiate the codeUINavigationControllercode with the controller Id like to update as its root view controller, setting the buttons titles to whatever I wantp  precode voidapplicationUIApplication application didReceiveRemoteNotificationNSDictionary userInfo         UINavigationController navController  [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllerself.welcomeViewController]        [self.window setRootViewControllernavController]        [self.welcomeViewController.buttonToUpdate setTitle Updated Text forState UIControlStateNormal]  codepre  pWhile this may not be the best solution maybe I could forget the codeUIButtonscode altogether and make the view controller use a codeUITableViewcode with its rows acting as buttons, but it works for the following scenariosp  p1 The app in in the foreground. Push notification alert pops up, user touches OK, the view is updated fine.p  p2 The app in the backgroundclosed. Device is in locked mode. Push notifications arrives, user unlocks the device, app is loaded, view is also updated fine.p  pThe problem seems to arise when user is using another app for example, and push notification arrives, but the user opens the app NOT through the push notification but by tapping the app icon. In that case, codeapplication didReceiveRemoteNotificationcode seems not be called, and the view in questions never gets updated. p  pHope my explanation is clear. Im open to suggestions on different approaches, or how to handle that last scenario using my approach.p  pThanksp
Negative 5002 pI am having a problem, which I cannot find a solution for anywhere. Maybe someone has an idea. For the background information, I am using two UIWindows different levels in my iPhone app.p  ul liFor UIWindow1 I have set a root view controller, which supports only Portrait orientation. li liFor UIWindow2 I have set a root view controller, which supports only LandscapeRight orientation.li ul  pBy default UIWindow1 is visible and at some point I want to show the UIWindow2  I do it and it will get displayed and the orientation changes also to LandscapeRight, so far so good.p  pNow at some point I want to hide the UIWindow2 again  I do it and it will be hidden and the view from UIWindow1 will be visible again, but the statusbar remains in the LandscapeRight orientation. Even when a keyboard should get visible, it is presented in the landscape orientation.p  pHow could I restore the statusbar orientation again after hiding UIWindow2p  pThanks for reading.p

Negative 5002 pGood day.p  pIm wondering if the Enterprise Library Caching using isolated storage disk, not DB can be accessed by multiple apps in IIS That is , can they all share the same instance of it.p  pI have various WCF services running on one machine, set up in different web apps and potentially in different app pools, if that makes a difference. They all need access to a shared cache.p  pI had been told that this is possible with EntLib, but after doing some reading Im not entirely sure this is the case. All of the services are running under NETWORK SERVICE user, but since they are all different apps in IIS does this prevent the sharing I know having a different user certainly would.p  pSo, can the same user use the same cache across multiple apps, or is it limited to within one appp  pAny guidance would be appreciatedp

Negative 5002 pI have a section of a site with multiple categories of Widget. There is a menu with each category name. For anybody with Javascript enabled, clicking a category reveals the content of the category within the page. They can click between categories at will, seeing the DOM updated as needed. The url is also updated using the standard hashhashbang if we are being Googlefriendly. So for somebody who lands on codeexample.comwidgetscode, they can navigate around to codeexample.comwidgetsonecode, codeexample.comwidgetstwocode, codeexample.comwidgetsthreecode etc.p  pHowever, to support user agents without Javascript enabled, following one of these category links must load a new page with the category displayed, so for someone without javascript enabled, they would navigate to codeexample.comwidgetsonecode, codeexample.comwidgetstwocode, codeexample.comwidgetsthreecode etc.p  pMy question is strongWhat should happen when somebody emwith Javascript enabledem lands on one of these URLS What should someone emwith Javascript enabledem be presented with when landing on codeexample.comwidgetsonecode for example Should they be redirected to codeexample.comwidgetsonecodestrongp  pemPlease note that I need a single page site experience for anybody with Javascript enabled, but I want a multipage site for a user agent without JavaScript. Any answer that doesnt address this fact doesnt answer the question. I am not interested in the merits or problems of hashbangs or singlepagesites vs multipagesites.emp

Negative 5002 pI would like to make a db.put operation in my Google App Engine service as resilient as possible, trying to maximize the likelihood of success even in the event of infrastructure issues or overload.

In my experience of having run fairly highworkload applications this is not necessarily a requirement. Sometimes you run into workloadspecific API bottlenecks, sometimes the slowness of one API causes the request deadline to expire in another. Even though such events have a low frequency, their number can be sizable if traffic is high. These are the situations I am trying to cover.p

If I add an alert statement at the end of the javascript function loadoverlay, then the image would show. Also, if I change the pcommandButton ajaxfalse to ajaxtrue the default mode, the image would show as well. But obviously that wont work, that means I have to manually refresh the page to make the overlay go away. And I dont think its particularly related to Primefaces either. I have tried to use the JSf tag hcommandButton, same issue was observed. p  pI just want to add that if I use debuggerfirebug to go through the original code of loadOverlay, the image would display properly as well.p  pI also did a experiment adding a loop running for 1 second at the end of the loadOverlay function. If I run without debugger, after clicking the Remove button, the page freezes for a second before carrying on deploying the overlay without the image though. But if I run it with debugger, the result will display on the screen immediately after the statement is executed. For example, after statement overlay.appendTodocument.body, the overlay would be deployed immediately. This make me feel the debugger is very unreliable it seems suggesting that the debugger is running on different flow than the real deal. p  pIve been testing my codes on Firefox 20.0. I just tried it on IE8, to my surprise, it works well on IE. So its Browser specific issue.p

Negative 5002 pA coworker and I are debating whether const or reference members are ever the right thing to do. const and reference members make a class noncopyable and unmovable unless you write your own copy and move operators which ignore the reference or const members. I cant find a case where ignoring copying or moving certain members just because they are references or const makes sense.p  pI think having an unmovable object is very rarely logically sound, and is a choice that only has something to do with whether the class is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14304618369872location invarianta. A noncopyable object is much more common, but the choice to make a class noncopyable has to do with whether it holds a resource which is logically noncopyable, if it represents sole ownership, etc. I cant think of a reason the sole trait of having a reference or const member or not would imply that the class emshouldem have either of these traits noncopyable or unmovablep  pShould they emeverem be used Should one but not the other What are examplesp

Negative 5002 pI am implementing a pattern to get around a JDBC limitation. For prepared statements, JDBC limits the number of placeholders to 2100.

I am doing this for 4 Java methods that use prepared statements.p  pThis tfsplitxml just constructs a single column token containing all the values. So an xml string of p  precodeltnodegtltvaluegt1ltvaluegtltvaluegt2ltvaluegtltnodegt  codepre  pwould get converted to a column containing two rows, with the values 1 and 2.p  pThis pattern seems to work fine for select statements, but it is failing for update statements.

Negative 5002 pIm given the task to transcode a bunch of GoToMeeting Video files each evening. Once the video has been transcoded, it will be uploaded to a website. However, before I jump too far into the project, I wanted to figure out if this is even possible.p  pMy current sample script is a simple batch file where I can drag and drop several files onto the batch file. It will transcode the first file, display an output and then continue to the second file to transcode. This is the expected behavior that Im looking for.p  precodeecho off Cg2mtranscoder.exe source1 echo 1 has completed. Cg2mtranscoder.exe source2 echo 2 has completed. Cg2mtranscoder.exe source3 echo 3 has completed. Cg2mtranscoder.exe source4 echo 4 has completed. pause codepre  pMy question is that if in C will be a Windows Service ultimately, would it be as simple as calling the external program codeg2mtranscoder.execode to do the transcoding and then put my upload script right afterwards Obviously, I would not want to upload a video that is currently being transcoded nor would I want the video to be upload without having been transcoded first.p  pMy subquestion is would putting this in a loop for each file in a directory cause any issues if the contents of the directory is only ever the pending videos to be transcoded If in the loop, would it try to loop through and start the transcoding of all files within the directory asynchronously or would it be more synchronous I would like to avoid the loop happening asynchronously as it could overload the machine causing artifacts or synchronization issues with the audiovideo timing. Most importantly, a video in the middle of transcoding or an untranscoded video cannot be uploaded.p  pAny coding suggestions for this would be great, but Im really looking for more of a understanding of how C works with code execution with having a external program called in the middle of the executed C code. p  pIm more of a RubyRails and Linux person and do not have much experience on C. I know enough to be dangerous, but just want to make sure that what Im looking to do is feasible.p

Therefore, I think, it is not feasible to just use an incrementing integer as primary key.p  pIn my application, I will be creating several tables like this for different measures and may later want to join them by uri1 and uri2, so that I get a result that contains from different tables all the values for a specific pair of uris.p  pI have found out something else I set up the connection in Java like thisp  precodeconn  DriverManager.getConnection  jdbcmysqllocalhostdbuseServerPrepStmtsfalseamprewriteBatchedStatementstrue,  user,pass codepre  pWhen I do not use rewriteBatchedStatementstrue, it seems to work fine.

Negative 5002 pI am seeing a weird situation. I have put a search bar in the navigation bar and have linked a UISearchDisplayController with the search bar. Now, the search display controller tends to hide the navigation bar when the user clicks on the search bar therefore, hiding the search bar also. In order to counter that, I subclassed UISearchDisplayController and implemented the following code p  precode voidsetActiveBOOLvisible animatedBOOLanimated    [super setActive visible animated animated]   [self.searchContentsController.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden NO animated NO]  codepre  pNow, this fixed the original problem. I am able to search and navigate to other controllers. p  pHowever, lets say that I do a search on view controller A and then click on a search result which then pushes view controller B on the navigation stack. Now, if I pop the view controller B and return back to A, then my navigation bar disappears. It looks like that the search display controller is active and so it hides the navigation bar. p  pIf I make the search display controller inactive and then push view controller B and then pop it, then the navigation bar appears.p  pSo, is there any way that my search display controller can remain active and the navigation bar does not disappear when I pop view controller B from navigation stack p  pAnd I am targeting iOS6p  pIt is a very long code so not sure what I should post here.p

Negative 5002 pI have a question concerning Excel 2010. I was just upgraded to Win7 and the Microsoft 2010 Office platform. We have an active embedded query within Excel to pull a time interval from Access, to assist in creating a particular chart. The data gathered from the ODBC connections is working properly in Access, because when we go back into the Access DB the Time data is in the correct format. It is when it is brought back into Excel 2010 that the time format is showing 1200 AM 0 for all intervals. The various searches in Google and such have turned up with nothing. When this is reran on the previous versions of Excel it is working correctly.p  pAny assistance would be greatly appreciated. p  pThanks...p

To get around this I havep  precodefunction       select.selectpicker style btn, menuStyle dropdown  codepre  pin the partial view too. This is not ideal, so is there a better way of keeping the selects styled to Bootstrap after an Ajax postback without having to repeat codep  pThe second problem is When a user clicks on the link with ideditname, the div with idfieldname slides out and the form fields inside the div with idfieldeditname slides in. This works great. However, when the save button is clicked I want the form fields to slide back in and the link to slide back out. I thought the Ajax option OnSuccessNameUpdated would do it but it seems like the Ajax postback is refreshing the Partial View making the fields abruptly disappear and the link reappear, as though the page had been refreshed. I know that Ajax is working as it should because the scroll position on the page is not lost.

Negative 5002 pIve been set a task to write some software to communicate from our embedded linux device to a server. The server that Im to communicate with uses a strict protocol, the protocol is very obscure and proprietary  I wouldnt like to name it on here as the information could be sensitive to the company I work for.p  pSo the data must be in either the form of 4 bit Nibbles N, 32 bit unsigned ints U, 32 bit signed ints S, 8 bit unsigned ints X and chars C.

So I need to send NNNNXXCCCC in that order to login.p  pThe data needs to be sent via UDP, and then listen for an acknowledgement on the same port.

Negative 5002 pIn Xcode 5, we can now hover over a UIImageView variable to get a Quick Look of the image.  If I want to see the image of an image view whose variable I dont have direct access to, but I have the hex address, is there a way to show it  i.e., If I know theres a UIImageView at code0x12193fb0code, doing codepo 0x12193fb0code in the debugger will print out the info about the object.  Is there a similar way to Quick Look by address  Using the Variables View next to the debugger isnt an option, since Im breaking the program manually, so its not in the context of the object that owns the image view.p

Negative 5002 pWhat I want, is a Window. That means a top bar to click and drag and hold a close button or whatever, and a scrollable content container below that that does not hide the top bar when you scroll.p  pI have two examples here stripped down from my original code to show my problem. The first div in the body is broken, because the scrollable content div expands vertically past the bounds of its parent. The second one works, but requires a fixed pixel height which I dont want. The second one shows how I want the first one to look.p  pWhat Ive triedp  ol liIf the overflowy is placed on the parent div, the parent container successfully contains all of the content, but I lose my top bar when the page is scrolled.li liIf I remove the padding and the header div, the content div fits perfectly, but I need those.li liIve tried overflowyauto and hidden as well as floatleftclearall from other questions.li liIve also tried using jquery ui to make the window resizable so I dont have to worry about static height on it, but as I resize it, the content div doesnt resize with the parent still, so even that doesnt work.li ol  pThe reason I want the parent div to be absolutely positioned is so that it appears like a window and exist outside the flow of the page. I eventually want to do a jQuery .draggable on it. This seems so simple, but I just dont see it.

Negative 5002 pMy CakePHP application unexpectedly updated all rows of a table, setting one column to the same value.  Using MySQL bin logs, I tracked down the culprit to the following queryp  precodeUPDATE database.table SET column  12345 WHERE 1  1 codepre  pI have not been able to figure out how my model operations could have resulted in that query being generated.  There are only a few pieces of code that update that column, and they are executed many thousands of times a day without issue.  p  pMy guess is the following code may be to blamep  precodethisgtMyModelgtid  id thisgtMyModelgtsaveFieldcolumn , value codepre  pIf a race condition occurs where the row the ID is set is deleted before saveField executes, could the offending query end up being generated  My tests resulted in a new row being created instead, but thats my best guess at the moment.p  pHas anyone encountered something like this with Cakep  pI am using CakePHP version 2.1.1p  pThis is reminiscent of a bug we encountered with an older version of Cake where a DELETE statement was generated with condition WHERE 1  1.

I was able to get the ListView to be based on the SQLite database by making a ContentProvider for the SQLite database which was suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11017646androidcursorloaderloadermanagersqliteherea.  Now my issue is that I want to update the SQLite database and have it reflected on the ListView.  I am using a loader and according to a hrefhttpwww.androiddesignpatterns.com201207understandingloadermanager.html relnofollowthisa if I implemented the loader right it will monitor the data.p  pI tried updating the SQLite database directly but, that didnt cause the ListView to update without closing and reopening.  My instinct from there is that I should implement the insert method in my contentProvider.  I did a very simple implementationp  precode    Override     public Uri insertUri uri, ContentValues contentValues          return ContentUris.withAppendedIduri, mCollectionDB.insertCollectioncontentValues  codepre  pUnfortunately, the result of this is my app crashes with a java.lang.NullPointerException.  This is especially confusing as using the exact same contentValues to make the .insertCollection call from my MainActivity works without issue.p  pThe issue Im really interested in is how to get my listView to update when I insert data into my SQLite database.  If inserting into the ContentProvider is irrelevant then please ignore that.  Im not really sure where I went wrong so Im not sure what other code may be useful, but Im happy to edit in more code if itll help.p

Negative 5002 pRecently updated a unity project from using the Prime31 social plugin, to the official facebook plugin on a Unity 4.3 project.p  pNoticed a couple of issues with it though regarding the post processor. Firstly It seems that the first time we build a project everything is fine, but successive building then causes the info.plist file to corrupt, an issue we currently deal with by deleting the plist before rebuilding as fortunately facebook sdk is the only thing that then makes changes to it outside of unity itself.p  pAnother issue is that every now and then Ill build and Ill get an error message about a file not found the main project file which is most definitely where it says it cant find it. Prior to that facebook scripts spit out a log message about Wrong file formatp  pHeres where the confusion comes in. That message is logged if the pbx file starts with a specific header and returns null I imagine this null return is what causes the error. but then in the Encode function for that class, it uses that header value to write the new file. Im confused as to why its writing a value that it will then in the future consider an invalid file.p  pany ideasp

So just doing a direct join gives me a cartesian product.  p  pSo I am thinking I could do two queries, first aggregating the total payments by store amp invoice for each and then do a join on those results because in the aggregate results, I would only have one record for each order store amp invoice.  But I dont know how to do this.  Ive tried several subqueries but cant seem the shake the cartesian product. Id like to be able to do this in one query as opposed to creating tables and joining on those as this will be ongoing.p  pThanks in advance for any help.p

This means that as soon as a closed message is clicked, any open message will be closed. The question now concerns the functionality of codeapp.MessageView.opencode. It could imho either use codejQuery.siblingscode to hide the message of all its siblings and show its ownp  precodeopen function      this.el         .addClassshowmessage         .siblings.showmessage         .removeClassshowmessage  codepre  pPersonally I think this solution quite elegant, I only dislike that it kind of needs to know that it has siblings. My other implementation would use a custom event that gets intercepted by the parent view codeapp.AppView.foocode that then calls codeapp.MessageView.closecode on every open messagep  precodeopen function      this.model.setmessageActive, true.triggermessageshow, this.model     this.el.addClassshowmessage  codepre  pThis feels a little more backbone to me, but seems a little overengineered. p  pI could event think of a third possibilty where the parent view simply keeps track of the last opened model itself and triggers any close event that is intercepted by the models view seems manageable but not very backbonelike to me  . Ive already covered quite some blog posts and questions here on SO, but came to no real satisfactory conclusion. Maybe someone can shed some light this specific question.p
Negative 5002 pIm creating a DirectX 11 game that renders complex meshes in 3D space.  Im using vertexindex buffersshaders and this all works fine.  However I now want to perform some basic overlay rendering  more specifically, I want to render wireframe boxes in 3D space to show the bounds of a particular area.  There would only ever be one or two boxes in view at any one time, and their vertices would change position each frame.p  pIve therefore been searching for simpler DX11 rendering methods but most articles I find still prepare a vertexindex buffer for very simple rendering.  I know that hardware is well optimised for processing vertex streams, but is the overhead of building and filling a vertex buffer every frame just to process 8 vertices really the most efficient methodp  pMy question is therefore, what is the most efficient method for performing this very simple rendering in DX11  Is there any more primitive method DrawLine, DrawLineListD3DXVECTOR3[], ... that would be a better solution  It could be less efficient pervertex than the standard method of passing vertex buffers because its only ever going to be used for a handful of vertices per frame.  p  pThanks in advancep  pRobp

I have a changelog setup of groovy files to run, however when I run dbmupdate and the database is already populated, the command errors out FROM JENKINS. If I run the same command from my local machine, dbmupdate just immediately finished because the database is already uptodate. p  pFrom what I read and how I understand it to work, dbmupdate should run any changesets that have not been run yet.

The vendor combobox is populated at startup.  The model combobox is filled with different data for each vendor.  Every time the user picks a different vendor, the model combobox must be updated with a different list.  p  pWhat should happenp  pWhen the method populateVendorAndModelComboBoxes is called, the first part of the program puts the vendor list in the vendor combobox.  Then a connection will be made between the currentTextChanged signal and the vendorChanged slot.  Then the vendorChanged function should be initially called to setup the Model combobox.  From then on, the vendorChanged function should be called whenever the user picks a new vendor.p  pWhat is happeningp  pWhen the connection is made between the currentTextChanged signal and the vendorChanged slot, the vendorChanged function is immediately called.  It should not immediately call the vendorChanged function.  This does not happen with any of my other signal  slot connections.  The vendorChanged function is executed with out error, then the execution point drops back to the vendorComboBox.currentTextChanged.connect.... statement and I immediately get an error TypeError argument 1 has unexpected type NoneType.p  pIf I comment out the statement that makes the connection, the program works without error.  The vendor combobox is filled with vendors and the model combobox is filled with models of the first vendor in the list.  That indicates that the vendorChanges code is working properly.p  pI have two questions.  Why does the connect statement cause the vendorChanged function to be immediately executed  What is the cause of the error messagep

Negative 5002 pIm trying to test a custom view using the Android testing framework. I copied the codeLinearLayoutTestcode a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformctsandroid4.4.2r2teststestswidgetsrcandroidwidgetctsLinearLayoutTest.java relnofollowcodea from Android CTS source as an example. This uses a codeLinearLayoutStubActivitycode which just inflates a layout.p  pI have a few issuesp  ul liWhen I create the codelinearlayoutlayout.xmlcode file in my codeandroidTestreslayoutcode folder, Android Studio cant even find the codexmlnsandroidcode URI. Not a big issue but indicates that something is not right. AS shows the appropriate highlighting for folders so I know AS is considering these as source folders.li liThe codeLinearLayoutStubActivitycode one sets content view to codeR.layout.linearlayoutlayoutcode but linearlayoutlayout cant be found.li liObviously the same is true of any reference to resources within the actual test code.li ul  pRunning the tests from command line gradle fails with the expected codecannot find symbolcode errors.p  pThere are a few questions related to testing custom views on SO and the appropriate way does seem to be inflating it within an Activity context but it seems like this is impossible without writing a separate app that just does the testing. I believe that is how the testing in the Android source would work too. One app just has dummy layouts and another does the actual testing. Is that the only way to do something like this p

Negative 5002 pIm looking for some ideas about how to implement some kind of contest.p  pSo our visitors have this option that after they enter some valid code they enter to some contest.

Also this way winners will be picker very quickly first couple days since there are more available.p  pSo i was thinking to do some kind of mysql rand on the prizes table, and if the result isnt a prize already took  associate it to our the code they entered on the previous stepmysql table.p  pBut ive the feeling this is going to happen right after launchday and then during the day other users will stand no chance since its going to have a lot of traffic, especially the first couple days where the first user will be winner NO matter what.... adn very likely our 2nd and 3rd since all prizes will be available by the time.p  pSo i was thinking to add some kind of date component to the rand or date since last winner.... here is where my mind starts thinking too much.p  pMaybe someone who already done something like this may have some better ideap  pThanks for any advice,p

Negative 5002 pThere are lots of online howtos for rsync, but after days of struggling, reading the man page repeatedly and hacking away at a excludefrom file, I need a hand. p  pI have created a custom local init script which loads the root filesystem into ram, and to support this environment I built a utility named ramsync which does a rsync between  in ram and  on the backing disk. This all went swimmingly when I just wanted to only exclude many paths and their contents. Ive been using this system for some time wo a hitch, but after reading more about rsync, I wanted to expand the utility to have an easily adjustabl conf file of patterns, to include some files, on the fly. so heres my example of where I ran into trouble. p  pInstalling software while running on ram, was as simple as doing the normal install, then calling the ramsync to copydown the changes on the disk. This is quiet a bit faster then doing all the unpackingtwiddling of an install on the disk directly, as you just write the final state down after all the file io is completed. difference of more than an hour doing a openstack compute node build p  pmy ramsyncs default excludes look likep  precodecat gt tmpexcludes ltlt EOF boot boot dev devpts dev media mnt mnt proc proc sys sys tmp tmp run run varcache varcache varlog varlog varrun varrun varlock varlock vartmp libmodulesvolatile.mounted etcapparmor.dcache ramsync etcmtab EOF codepre  pramsync is the mountpoint for the disk in ramp  pI used this list via the excludefrom tmpexcludes of rsync. Further reading into rsyncs man page led me to believe that the concept of excludeinclude was a bit misleading as excludefrom and includefrom both could include both includes and excludes using the  and  operaters, and includeexclude just implied the default if you didnt include an operator. My reading and what I thought was progress in understanding rsync filter patterns and parsing led me to remake this pattern file asp  precodecat gt tmpexcludes ltlt EOF  libmodulesvolatile.mounted  etcapparmor.dcache  etcmtab  varcache  varlock  varlog  varrun  vartmp  boot  dev  media  mnt  proc  sys  tmp  ramsync  run EOF codepre  pI then tried to apply some includes to this to get some of the files and directories in varlog but only the ones I specified. p  pAll that preamble to ask my questionp  pHow can I both exclude almost all of varlog EXCEPT for p  pvarlognova   directoryp  pvarlogvcosinstall.log filep  pI need this file and directory to be saved down.

Negative 5002 pWith WP8.1 for Universal Apps XAML a new property called OpticalMarginAlignment was introduced for the TextBlock control.

Negative 5002 pso Im trying to make a battleship game, and I implemented a 10x10 grid containing gifs of some pixelated water. Now, what Im trying to do is offset the grid one cell down and to the right so I can place the numbers and letters along the side and top like in a real battleship game. The problem is that when I try to offset it, it removes either the entire right side column of cells and reduces the window accordingly, and visa versa with the bottom. Heres my codep  pEDIT 3 I have replaced the gif so that it can be used by everyone, simply copy the code and run it.p  precodepublic class ButtonGrid   JFrame framenew JFrame creates frame     JLabel[][] grid names the grid of buttons      public ButtonGridint width, int length throws MalformedURLException          URL urlPic  new URLhttpi47.tinypic.com14wswi9.gif         ImageIcon urlPicture  new ImageIconurlPic              frame.setLayoutnew GridLayoutwidth,length set layout             gridnew JLabel[width][length] allocate the size of grid             forint y0 yltlength y                     forint x0 xltwidth x                             grid[x][y] new JLabelurlPicture creates new button                             frame.addgrid[x][y] adds button to grid                                                grid[1][1].setForegroundColor.red              frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE             frame.setSize270, 400             frame.pack sets appropriate size for frame             frame.setVisibletrue makes frame visible          public static void mainString[] args throws MalformedURLException             new ButtonGrid11,11makes new ButtonGrid with 2 parameters       codepre  pEDIT It seems that I may not have made this really clear. On a real battleship game, there is a row of numbers and a column of letters. The rest of the grid is simply water with the ships inside of it. With the code I have provided, the entire grid is water, and I want to offset to place a row of numbers and a column of letters just like in a real battleship board. If I try to place anything on top of the current grid, it doesnt change anything. I tried to change the foreground color and even changed the picture of one of the cells to something different, and the grid still remained the same a 11 x 11 grid of animated pixel water.p  pSecond EDIT I have rewritten my code to draw a grid on top and on the left of the window, but now I am getting a null pointer exception. I dont exactly know what is wrong with thisp  pEDIT FOUR Removed unneeded code.p

Negative 5002 pI am having some difficulties figuring out why this is happening. I am using owl graphic slide and when the mouse hovers over the last slide element the page wants to scroll off the page to the right At one point I thought I had narrowed it down to a padding issue created by owls translate3d css but have not been able to find that again. Ive tried shrinking the containers to confirm a padding problem in the css but I still get the same problem. Shutting off other jquery, and checking console for problems has  still left me scratching my head. I have opened the website for a preview so you all can see what is happening. a hrefhttpcypion.comtemplate.php relnofollowhttpcypion.comtemplate.phpa. use the slider and go to the last slide and touch it with the mouse. Any ideasp  pEDIT Chrome seems to be the only browser with this issue.p

Negative 5002 pI have a JavaScript code that I got from the site a hrefhttpwww.micahcarrick.comchangeimagewithjquery.html relnofollowhttpwww.micahcarrick.comchangeimagewithjquery.htmla    I only modified the name of the images as to use .png files I have. The issue is if I open this in a web browser locally, then when I click on one of thumbnails called django.gif I am directed to the actual image rather then the new image replacing the other. However, if I put this .html script on a Godaddy.com website and go to it with the same web browser it does work correctly just like the original site a hrefhttpwww.micahcarrick.comcodejqueryimageswapindex.html relnofollowhttpwww.micahcarrick.comcodejqueryimageswapindex.htmla .  I notice that at the site I got this code from the author mentions that The thumbnails are links to full size versions of the images. If a user does not have JavaScript, the links still go to the large image. Does this mean I dont have Java Script I can run other simple JavaScript codes locally. Why does this work when I put it on a site, but does not work when testing locally, even when using the exact same web browser Here is the codep  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN     httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt   lttitlegtExample Change Image with jQuerylttitlegt   ltstyle typetextcssgt     body  width 600px margin auto      imageWrap           width 640px          height 420px          background urlajaxloader.gif center center norepeat         ltstylegt   ltscript typetextjavascript      srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.6.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction          .thumbnail.liveclick, function              mainImage.hide             imageWrap.cssbackgroundimage, urlajaxloader.gif             var i  ltimg gt.attrsrc,this.href.loadfunction                  mainImage.attrsrc, i.attrsrc                 imageWrap.cssbackgroundimage, none                 mainImage.fadeIn                          return false                  ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt   lth1gtExample Change Image with jQuerylth1gt   ltpgt     Main image is replaced using jQuery when a thumbnail is clicked.

Negative 5002 pIve been assigned a piece of work to investigate and propose a fix for an intermittent and apparently nonreplicable bug which is causing web service calls to fail with the following errorp  precodeMessage does not conform to configured policy [ TimestampPolicyS AuthenticationTokenPolicyS ]  No Security Header found codepre  pThe application is the Spring based back end for an online public facing high traffic web site. The web services are accessed with a Axis2 1.4 client.p  pI think Ive managed to track the issue down to a possible concurrency issue, but it doesnt seem to be tied to load exactly, the failure statistics dont support it sometimes days with low load are worse than days with high load.p  pAnyway, all of client code for the web services is contained within a single class with a Repository annotation. Classes in the wider application that need access to this WebServiceClient class have it declared at class scope with Resource annotation where it is autowired in as required.p  pThe problem as I see it is that in the WebServiceClient the stubs are declared at class scope like sop  precodeprivate ValidationStub validationStub private CustInfoStub custInfoStub codepre  pand are initialised in method scope when the web service is calledp  precodethis.validationStub new ValidationStub this.url prepareStubthis.validationPort, username, password codepre  pwhere the prepareStub method creates the security header and adds it as followsp  precodestub.getServiceClient.addHeaderelement codepre  pI think if I move the stubs from class scope to method scope it will solve the issue, like sop  precodeValidationStub validationStub  new ValidationStubthis.url codepre  pHas anyone ran into a similar issue Im a bit concerned that making this change will have a performance impact.p

Depending on my situation, Id either want to target one specific ID from the array, or all entries in the array at once. I do understand that each entry into an array is given a unique index number, starting with 0. Therefore, codeonecode is index 0, and codetencode is index 9.p  pI also understand that I can use codeforcode loops with arrays, that will cycle through each entry. My issue is that I cant seem to get my function working when it is called from a click event on an codeinput typebuttoncode element.p  pHere are two examples of my code. One targets one specific entry, the other targets them all. Or at least, that is what it should be doing.

Ive simply omitted the HTML code to the first 10 elements.p  pThe majority of the 250 IDsclasses, are located on codeltoptiongtcode elements. The code.showcode and code.hidecode classes used in the code are not applied directly to the codeltoptiongtcode elements themselves, but to codeltselectgtcode elements that contain these options. Each codeltselectgtcode element has a unique ID.p  pIf I can just figure out how to do this with arrays, everything will be fine.p  pThanks.p

Negative 5002 pI have the following problem I have a matrix of, say 20K discrete distributions histograms and I need to calculate the KL divergence KLD between each of these pairs. The trivial way to do that is by using two for loops and calculating KLD between each two distributions via the standard KLD calculation. It takes time. Lots of time. I wonder of there is a some kind of matrixarray based calculation of the above. Surely I am not the first one who encounters this problem. Unfortunately I am new at python. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks A.p

Negative 5002 pSo I have managed to use a custom directive to upload images to my server, through Angular.js. I have also managed to implement the camera functionality from Cordova. Now I am trying to connect the two, but when sending images to the server, they get stored as null. I believe the problem lies in the fact that I was using an input field to get the image, and it was getting the full Object, and now I am getting just the image path after I take the picture and send it. My problem is, I dont really understand how I could convert the path to an Object, IF that is the problemp  pstrongindex.htmlstrongp  precodeltform classformhorizontal roleformgt     ltbutton classpicButton ngclickgetPhoto classbutton buttonblock buttonprimarygtTake Photoltbuttongt     ltimg ngsrclastPhoto stylemaxwidth 100gt ... ltformgt codepre  pstrongcontrollers.jsstrongp  precodescope.getPhoto  function      Camera.getPicture.thenfunctionimageURI          console.logimageURI         scope.lastPhoto  imageURI         scope.upload lt call to upload the pic     ,     functionerr          console.errerr     ,          quality 75,         targetWidth 320,         targetHeight 320,         saveToPhotoAlbum false        scope.upload  function      var url       var fd  new FormData      previously I had this     angular.forEachscope.files, functionfile         fd.appendimage,file           fd.appendimage, scope.lastPhoto      http.posturl, fd,           transformRequestangular.identity,         headersContentTypeundefined                   .successfunctiondata, status, headers         scope.imageURL  data.resourceuri set it to the response we get          .errorfunctiondata, status, headers        codepre  pWhen printing scope.lastPhoto I get the image path emfilevarmobileApplications..tmpfilename.jpgemp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pRequest Headersp  precodeWebKitFormBoundaryEzXidt71U741Mc45 ContentDisposition formdata nameimage  filevarmobileApplicationsC65C803033BF4BBBB2BB7ECEC86E87A7tmpcdvphoto015.jpg WebKitFormBoundaryEzXidt71U741Mc45 codepre  pShould this causing the problem Since I can see I am sending the path but not the image itself..p  pBefore changing, I was using a custom directive, and was using scope.files to append to my request in the upload functionp  precodeltinput typefile fileinputfiles multiple  onchangeangular.elementthis.scope.filesChangedthisuploadgt ltbutton ngclickuploadgtUploadltbuttongt codepre

Negative 5002 pOverview p  pI have shops with defined radius 20 miles. I have customers. If a customer is within 20 miles from a shop, the customer is assigned to this shop. If one customer is within 20 miles from more than 1 shop, the customer is assigned to the shop that the customer spend most money to.p  pThe above is implemented and working fine. But now I have new requirement, I need help with. The shops now have limit of maximum number of assigned customers. So my problem is when a customer can be assigned to two shops, and the customer is suppose to be assigned to the because of most money spend, but this shop already reached the maximum number of assigned customers.

Negative 5002 pI need to tune PID gains in a system which has a quite large delay. Its a common temperature controller, but the temperature probe is far away from the heater. Some further infop  ul lipthe response of the probe is delayed about 10 seconds from any change on the heaterpli lipthe temperature is sampled  1 Hz, with a resolution of 0.01 Cpli lipthe heater is controller in PWM with a period of 1 Hz, with a 10bit PWMpli lipthe goal is to maintain the oscillation below 0.05 Cpli ul  pCurrently Im using the controller as PI. I cant avoid oscillations. The higher the gain, the smaller and faster the oscillations. Still too high about 0.15 C. Reducing the P and I gains leads to very long and deep oscillations.p  pI think this is due to the delay. The settling time is not a problem, it may take all the time it needs.p  pIm puzzling over how get the system to work. Lets think to use only I. When the probe reaches the target value and the I output starts to decrease, the temperature will rise for some other time. I cannot use the derivative term because the variations are too slow and the dError is very close to zero if I set the dGain to a huge value there is too much noise.p  pAny ideap

When i try to write config patch for this section, this section is not built at run time.

I observed a difference here Domains section is under codeltSitecoregt,  ltmembershipgt and ltroleManager gtcode are in codeltsystem.webgtcode section. Is this the reason that these are not included in web.config can we write patches for those sections only under codeltsitecoregtcodep  pAny ideas are appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 5002 pI came across a project where we have variables in a data set such as customer ids, dates they purchased the products, type of products they purchased, and product price. I wanted to predict at what date the customer is likely to make a transaction and what product they are likely to purchase. Dates could be in days, weeks, or months. p  pFrom my understanding, I think Ill have to split the problem into different models. 1st model predicting the products that EACH customer will purchase. 2nd model predicting the date of the transaction that is likely to occur for EACH customer. Obviously for the first model, we should be using classification machine learning models. I am not sure which model should I be using for the 2nd model. It could be time series, but I have not predicted the dates for a model yet. I hope I am the right track. p  pMain questions are  BRp  ol liCan we predict the dates from any machine learning techniques in terms of days, weeks, or months li liCan we predict the dates and products that each customer is going to purchase or do we need to split the problem and perform separate models for itli ol  pSuggestions will be very much appreciatedp

Negative 5002 pIm working on a Xamarin.Forms project at the moment, which requires a custom layout for a cell.p  pIve written the WP and Droid layouts, but stuck on iOS. The layout is pretty simple p  ul liTwo columns, two rows. Rows are same height, first column is 96px wide and rest is taken by the secondli liThe first column is filled in by a number, spanning both rowsli liThe first row of the second column is filled by a titleli liThe second row of the second column is filled by a detail text, aligned left, and a date, aligned right.li liIf the detail text is too long, it is trunkated, date is always displayedli ul  pNow for this, I wrote a custom renderer, which uses native elements XamForms ViewCell is extremely slow, 6x slower than e.g. TextCell or ImageCell. But on iOS, the only platform Ive never really worked with, I ran into a problem.p  pIve created a class, inheriting from UITableViewCell, and added 4 labels to it titleLabel, detailLabel, dateLabel, and bigNumLabel latter being the first columns content.p  pI fill these labels, and add them to the Subviews, but when it gets to actually assigning them to an area, Im pretty much shot. Im using the following codep  p codepublic override void LayoutSubviews                      base.LayoutSubviews             bigNumLabel.Frame  new CoreGraphics.CGRect0, 0, 96, 96             titleLabel.Frame  new CoreGraphics.CGRect96, 12, 300, 38             detailLabel.Frame  new CoreGraphics.CGRect96, 62, 300, 38             dateLabel.Frame  new CoreGraphics.CGRect396, 62, 100, 38          codep  pNow, the only issue I have is, Im used to WPs and XamForms ubersimple relative layouts. On WP, I could make a grid, two columns, two rows, and align the data relatively  bigNumLabel in row0 column0, with rowspan2, titleLabel in row0 column1, aligned left, detailLabel in row1 column1, aligned left, and dateLabel in row1 column1 aligned right. On iOS, however, I have to specify down to a pixel level  how is it easier than WP then Why do people perfer this old system instead of a truly flexible layoutp  pBut that is not my question at the moment. Rather, Im asking, how to align these parts so that they dont overlap, and are not fixed at a given pixel  but rather as a flowp

Negative 5002 pHow can we Visualize data in an ObservableCollection or List which is set as ItemSource of ItemsControl We are using ItemsControl within a ScrollViewer to make a custom collections control, due to some technical reasonsDesign Constraints, we can not use ListView, or GridView controls which supports VirtualizingStackPanel and Data Virtualization through ISupportIncremental, so we must use ItemsControl within a ScrollViewer.  So how can our ScrollViewer control notify the bound observable collection that scrolling has come to an end and load more data into the ObservableCollection,  I found some information on strongRandom access data virtualizationstrong but not sure how would i implement that in my WinRT, C Custom Control project, and sample codes would be helpfulp
Negative 5002 pWondering if I could get some advice or possibly some code examples regarding an android app I am developing.

Negative 5002 pI have a file which I want to retrieve with a cffile action  read command.  However, I would like to give the user the option of only retrieving a small number of lines.  The file could be quite large, and might take a very long time to load.  Meanwhile the user may only need to know whether he wants to delete it, and a page or two may be quite enough.  Does ColdFusion offer any way to limit the output of this command  Or can anyone suggest another approach to this problemp

Negative 5002 pIm talking about LRU memory page replacement algorithm implement in C, NOT in Java or C. p  pAccording to the OS course a hrefhttplass.cs.umass.edushenoycourslyesfall08lecturesLec18notes.pdf relnofollownotesap  blockquote   pOK, so how do we actually implement a LRU Idea 1 mark everything we touch with a timestamp.   Whenever we need to evict a page, we select the oldest page leastrecently used. It turns out that this   simple idea is not so good. Why Because for every memory load, we would have to read contents of the   clock and perform a memory store So it is clear that keeping timestamps would make the computer at   least twice as slow. Ip blockquote  pMemory load and store operation should be very fast. strongIs it really necessary to get rid of these little tiny operationsstrong p  pIn the case of memory replacement, strongthe overhead of loading page from disk should be a lot more significant than memory operationsstrong. Why would actually care about memory store and load p  pIf what the notes said isnt correct, then what is the real problem with implementing LRU with timestamp p  pEDITp  pAs I dig deeper, the reason I can think of is like the following. These emmemory store and loadem operations happen when there is a page hit. In this case, we are not loading page from disks, so the comparison is not valid. p  pSince the hit rate is expected to be very high, so updating the data structure associated with LRU should be very frequent. Thats why we care about the operations repeated in the udpate process, e.g., memory load and store. p  pBut still, Im not convincing how significant the overhead is to do memory load and store. There should be some measurements around. Can someone point me to them Thanksp

Negative 5002 pI am doing a project about image processing, and I need to solve the following set of equations  p  precodeNxNz zx1,yzx,y 0   NyNz zx1,yzx,y 0   codepre  pand equations of the boundary bottom and right side of the image  p  precodeNxNz zx,yzx1,y 0   NyNz zx,yzx,y1 0   codepre  pwhere Nx,Ny,Nz are the surface normal vectors at the corresponding coordinates and are already determined.  Now the problem is that since x,y are the coordinates on an image, which typically has a size of say x300 and y200. So there are 300x20060000 unknowns. I rewrite the equations in the form of Mzb, where M has a size of 120,000x60000, and both z and b are vectors of length 60000. When I solve it using the function in python scipy.linalg.lstsq, I run into memory errors.br I notice that M is very sparse as it only has two nonzero entries of either 1 or 1 in each row. However, I dont know how I can utilize it to solve the problem. Any ideas how I can solve it more efficiently in matlab or pythonp  pIn python I find a library that has the a hrefhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocscipy0.15.1referencegeneratedscipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr.htmlscipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr relnofollowlsmra method as mentioned by someone in the comment. Other than using this algorithm to solve the equation Mxb, I want to know if I need to store M and B in sparse format as well. Now I just create a very large array with all entries zero in the beginning, then I use a  for loop to loop over each pixel and change the corresponding entries to 1 or 1. Then I apply lsmr to solve Mxb directly. Does it help if I construct the matrix M and b in any one of the a hrefhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocscipy0.15.1referencesparse.html relnofollowsparse formata Right now most of the time spent is in solving Mxb. Construct the array M,b and doing all previous tasks take negligible time compared to solving Mxb. p  pthanksp  pedit this is the python code I use to generate matrix M and b. They should be correct, but not sure if there are other better ways of rewriting the system of linear equations.  p  precodeeqno  0 for pix in rangetotalpix     row, col  y[pix], x[pix]      if indexarray[row,col] gt 0  confirm x,y is inside boundary          check xdirection         if indexarray[row,col1] gt 0  x1,y is inside boundary             M[eqno,pix]  1             M[eqno,pix1]  1             b[eqno,0]  normalarray[row,col,0]normalarray[row,col,2]             eqno  1           check ydirection         nextpix  indexarray[row1,col]         if nextpix gt 0             M[eqno , pix]  1             M[eqno , nextpix]  1             b[eqno,0]  normalarray[row,col,1]normalarray[row,col,2]             eqno  1 codepre

Negative 5002 pI am making a chat system, and I have the below database schema everything not related to the core problem has been removed.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdk326.png altDatabase schemap  pA thread represents a conversation between two participants. When a new thread is created persisted, two participants should be created one for the sender and one for the receiver a message is added to the thread, but this is not relevant in this case. So I have mapped the two database tables to two entities.p  precodeEntity Tablename  participant public class Participant      Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY     Column     private int id      ManyToOnefetch  FetchType.LAZY, targetEntity  Thread.class, optional  false     JoinColumnname  threadid     private Thread thread       Getters and setters   Entity Tablename  thread public class Thread      Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY     Column     private int id      OneToManyfetch  FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy  thread, targetEntity  Participant.class, cascade  CascadeType.ALL     private SetltParticipantgt participants  new HashSetltgt      ManyToOnefetch  FetchType.LAZY, targetEntity  Participant.class, cascade  CascadeType.ALL, optional  false     JoinColumnname  senderid     private Participant sender      ManyToOnefetch  FetchType.LAZY, targetEntity  Participant.class, cascade  CascadeType.ALL, optional  false     JoinColumnname  receiverid     private Participant receiver       Getters and setters  codepre  pFrom the codeThreadcode entity, the codeparticipantscode association should contain all participants in the thread, while the codesendercode and codereceivercode contain references to the sender and receiver, respectively, for convenience. Thus, only two participants should be persisted in the database. Here is the code that I wrote to persist a new threadp  precodeThread thread  new Thread  Participant sender  new Participant sender.setThreadthread  Participant receiver  new Participant receiver.setThreadthread  thread.setSubjectsubject thread.setSendersender thread.setReceiverreceiver  SetltParticipantgt participants  new HashSetltgt2 participants.addsender participants.addreceiver thread.setParticipantsparticipants  Thread saved  this.threadRepository.savethread codepre  pThis throws the below exception.p  blockquote   porg.hibernate.TransientPropertyValueException Notnull property   references a transient value  transient instance must be saved before   current operation  com.example.thread.entity.Participant.thread    com.example.thread.entity.Threadp blockquote  pI tried many variations of the codecascadecode attribute on both entities, but the same exception is thrown in all cases although with different transient properties. Logically speaking, the approach should not be problematic, as all that has to happen is that the codeThreadcode entity is persisted first in order for the participants to obtain the generated ID, before they should be persisted themselves.p  pDo I have a problem with my mapping, or what is the problem Thank youp

Negative 5002 pIm using angular, and in an angularUI modal window I want to show the Drop In form from Braintree to get a payment method.

Then, when I enter the credit card number and the expiration date and hit pay, the codeonPaymentMethodReceivedcode event is triggered once per setup execution That is, if the first time I call the modal it will trigger the event once, the second time it will trigger it twice, and so on. Like if each time I call setup, a new hook to the event is created. p  pAny idea on how to avoid this Is there a way to unbind the codeonPaymentMethodReceivedcode event handler I do need to call the setup several times since each time I call the modal, the clientToken may have changed. p  pThanks for any help or pointer to help.p

Negative 5002 pI currently have a codeContentProvidercode that manages access to a database, which has several tables linked through foreign keys.

There is also a table of sets rows in the audio table must have an associated row in the set table manytoone.p  pcodeON CASCADE DELETEcode is active on the tables, so when rows in the set table are deleted, the rows in the audio table that referenced the set are also deleted.p  pMy codeContentProvidercode also deletes the referenced file when a call to codedeletecode is made that targets the audio table.p  pThe database side, therefore, works well. However, if the rows in the audio table are deleted, the files remain.

Negative 5002 pThis is almost the same question as a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions3868127rdbmsmovefrequentlyupdatedcolumnsintoaseparatetableherea but I am seeking specific clarification about performance, not solving any errors.p  pConsider a database table containing a mediumtolarge number of attributes columns, most of which are static or infrequently updated.  The table is used in strongread operations extremely frequentlystrong.p  pIf two or three of the attributes columns strongarestrong updated frequently, is it advisable to split those off into a separate table for performance reasonsp  pOne reason I had understood that this would be a benefit is that the query cache for a table is erased when the table is updated. In my case, database is MySQL, table type is InnoDB rowlevel locking.p  pEdit One of the frequently updated columns is not part of the frequent reads, but it is updated immediately after maybe 25 of the reads.p  pAnother of the frequently updated columns is both part of some frequent reads and updated with each read, although I may batch the updates.p

It appears that any commands in the code.ebextensionscode folder run in the context of the host machine and not the docker container. Is that correctp  pIm fine with running a command to execute migrations inside of the docker container after startup, but how do I ensure that the migrations only run on a single instance Is there an environment variable or some other way I can tell what machine is the leader from within the docker containerp  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong I posted a hrefhttpsforums.aws.amazon.commessage.jspamessageID666973 relnofollowa question in the Amazon Elastic Beanstalk forums asking how to run commands from Docker host on the containera on the 6thAug15.

Negative 5002 pIm using Entity API, Form API and Entity Reference Autocomplete in Drupal. I have a relationship between two types, clubs and courses, each codeclubcode can have many codecoursescode so basically the table codecoursecode contains a column called codegoclidcode which references the codeclubcode id number like sop  precode hookschema  schema[course]  array      other fields... goclid gt array     description gt Reference to the club,     type gt int,     unsigned gt TRUE,     not null gt TRUE,   ,   ... a few lines later... foreign key gt array   relatedclub gt array  join alias     table gt club,     columns gt arraygoclid gt id,   , ,  etc.  codepre  pThen I include a field like so in the codecoursecode formp  precodeform[goclid]  array     title gt tReference to the club,     type gt entityreference,     eraentitytype gt club,     defaultvalue gt issetcoursegtgoclid  coursegtgoclid  ,     required gt FALSE,  codepre  pNow, the autocomplete gives suggestions only when I type an id number, and then populates the field value with the label name of the golf club.  What I want is exactly the opposite I want to get suggestions by typing the name of the club, and then when I choose one, the form field should be populated with the id number of that object.p  pWhy is Entity Reference Autocomplete behaving in an unexpected way What can I do to obtain the desired behaviourp

Negative 5002 pIm using a jQuery menu to display reports available from a list for more info, but the display names have special characters and such that make Spring choke if I try to pass them back as PathVariables. I was hoping I could set the menus value like I can do with a dropdown select menu to the simpler filename... or ideally to the ReportTemplate object itself with the displayName, fileName, inputs, etc. p  pCurrenly Im putting lists on the model, writing the names of each to the menu, then when one is selected I run .loadgetReportTemplateui.item.texttrying to grab that name, send it back to the controller, get the lists emagainem, find that report displayName that matches, get thst reportTemplate, then send emthatem to reportOptions to populate the div with all the details on it, then all that gets loaded into the original page. This eems like a backwards way to do it, even if it did work which it cant, because displayName special characters choke it up.p  pstrongReports.jspstrongp  precodemenu.menu              items  gt not.uiwidgetheader,         select  functionevent, ui                      .selected, this.removeClassselected             ui.item.addClassselected             reportOptions.hidedropreportOptions.load..reportsgetReportTemplateui.item.text             reportOptions.showdrop               codepre  pstrongReportsController.javastrongp  precodeRequestMappinggetReportTemplatejasperFileName public String getReportTemplateActiveUser UserInfoImpl user, ModelMap model, PathVariable String jasperFileName      SuppressWarningsuncheckedTODO Is this all the wrong way to do it Shoudl I get it again from rptmanager     ListltReportTemplategt reports  ListltReportTemplategt model.getreportTemplatesthis.getReportTemplatesuser     for ReportTemplate rpt  reports              if rpt.getJasperFileName  jasperFileName             model.putreportRequest, rptoverwrite previous reportrequest      otherwise, if not found...     return null  codepre  pstrongNotestrong Im figuring out the best way to escape the characters causing problems in my displayName when I pass it back, but this still feels like the wrong way to do the whole problem.

Negative 5002 pIn the paper Empirical analysis of detection cascades of boosted classifiers for rapid object detection, section 2.3, the authors talk about fast contrast stretching. I do not see in OpenCV or Matlab any reference to this preprocessing. Normally one has to insert variance normalized subwindows in the cascade classifier, but in the paper it is indicated that the image is normalized by an arbitrary constant which multiplies the standard deviation. I do not know if this constant c2 in the paper was actually taken into account for training the cascade feature thresholds and if not, how could i use this operation to avoid another more complicated contrast enhancement technique in the detection process. Any hint would be very useful.

Each sprite is just a white pixel 1x1  theres no need to even use textures for them. p  pAdding this much sprites to the scene directly at once is impossible or at least i think so.

Ideally, I would want to unprotect and open at the same time but Im not sure how to accomplish this.codeOpenFromStreamcode does have an overload where you can feed it a string as a password which I tried but no luck there. The documentation isnt great for these methods so Im not sure if I was even using them correctly.p

Negative 5002 pI run a reasonably popular blog on Wordpress and have  a fair number of comments forwarded to me by the mailserver currently sitting on my web server.  However, I am in the process of moving to a new server where I do not want to run a mailserver.

Negative 5002 pMy Android app has a simple loader NativeActivity with a very simple codeandroidmaincode which only loads a different shared object and passes control to itp  precodetypedef void Tandroidmain androidapp void androidmain androidapp state       void glib  dlopenlibmain.so, RTLDNOW     void fmain  dlsymglib, androidmain     Tandroidmain libmain  Tandroidmainfmain     libmainstate  codepre  pThis works well.. about half of the times. Other times it crashes since codedlopencode fails and return NULL with errno2 No such file.br Due to the strange inconsistency of this occurrence I suspected a timing issue and indeed, adding a codesleep1code before codedlopencode stopped it from happening. Something more robust than codesleep1code would be just trying it in a loopp  precodeint count  0 void glib  dlopensoName, RTLDNOW whileglib  NULL      schedyield     count     glib  dlopensoName, RTLDNOW  codepre  pThe count Im getting from this loop is usually something in the range of 1070 on my device. But this is a hackish ugly solution.p  pWhat is really going on here How come I can only load other shared objects only slightly after the NativeActivity starts Is there a better way to find when when its safe to load itp  pIt should be noted that I am also calling codeSystem.loadLibrarymaincode from my NativeActivitys codeonCreatecodep

Negative 5002 pstrongtldrstrong Im trying to map a codefirst model to an existing database where a certain hierarchy of objects has a mixed inheritance scheme. Some concrete classes use TPH and some use TPT. I cant seem to get the mapping correct.p  hr  pI have a hierarchy of objects which Im trying to map to an existing database. Some of the concrete classes contain additional properties, so they have their own table some of the concrete classes do not, so they live in the base table and rely on a discriminator column. To simplify things, Ive created a POC. The database structure is like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE Foos      Id INT IDENTITY NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,     FooType TINYINT NOT NULL   CREATE TABLE FooTpts      Id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY          FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES FoosId,     Value INT NOT NULL  codepre  pAnd the equivalent POCOs would bep  precodepublic abstract class Foo      public int Id  get set    public class FooTph  Foo   public class FooTpt  Foo      public int Value  get set   codepre  pSeems simple enough.

Negative 5002 pthanks for this commmunity, it has helped me alot already. This is the first question I have to post myself, and it is somewhat specific to my project.p  pI have started from MHartls great rails tutorial. There were models for Users and Microposts and I have added a Cars model, where each user can have a car referenced by the carid.p  pIn the console I can create a user and a micropost, and assign the user to the micropost by stating post.user  michael and then it would set the posts userid to michaels id. I am trying to do the same for cars, where i can set a users carid by stating michael.car  somecar but it gives an error even though the model associations LOOK exactly the same, and I have even remigrated the carid to the user model as reference. See belowp  precodeclass User lt ActiveRecordBase  hasmany microposts, dependent destroy  belongsto cars  class Micropost lt ActiveRecordBase    belongsto user    belongsto car  class Car lt ActiveRecordBase    hasmany microposts, dependent destroy    hasmany users    acceptsnestedattributesfor users    acceptsnestedattributesfor microposts codepre  pHere is my last migration for the caridp  precodeclass Addreferencecartousers lt ActiveRecordMigration  def change     addreference users, car      addforeignkey users, cars  end end codepre  pin synch with what I had done for the usermicropost connection.p  pI am kind of lost on where else to look for why this does not work, does anyone have any hintspointers on what I am missing herep
Negative 5002 pI was studying about fail fast and fail safe iterators and I had this question in mind. I am not sure if my understanding is correct. p  pVector is synchronized thread safe collection object in Java. So when I try to get the iterator of vector it is a fail fast iterators which means . . When I use this iterator on vector object and any changes made to the vector it will throw ConcurrentModificationExeption. But since vector is thread safe it should be provided with fail safe iterators.p  pWhy is not the case in Java with vector. Where as with concurrentHashMap it is provided with thread safe iterators.p
