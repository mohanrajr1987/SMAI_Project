Positive 76 pI am currently looking at different alternatives to improve the performance of a search operations for a existing web application. I am attempting to figure out what would be the available maximum improvement possible for the existing system with compression before looking at different alternatives.p  pIn the existing system a result set returned in response to a user search is formulated using internal as well as external data resources. The result set is made of of nested Java collection objects. I would like to compress and transfer objects and decompress them as and when required.

A Java object has a lot of additional information not needed. If you have millions of objects you have this overhead millions of times.pli lipIf possible write the objects to a database, datastore or file and use caching to keep frequently used objects in memory.pli lipIf size is important, you might like to have a simple serialization of your own. Using ObjectOutputStream is probably not the answer. This is because ObjectOutputStream has a significant overhead making small objects much larger.The stream format includes a lot of typerelated metadata. If you are serializing small objects, the mandatory metadata will make it hard for the compression algorithm to break even, even if you implement custom serialization methods.pli lipUsing DataOutputStream with minimal or no added type information will give a better result. For better compression, you may need to look at the properties of the data that you are compressing.Mixed data is not generally that compressible using a general purpose compression algorithms.pli lipUse DeflatorOutputStream and InflatorInputStream as these are simplerfastersmaller than the alternatives. The reason it is smaller is it just does the compression whereas the alternatives add file format extensions like CRC checks and headers.pli lipIt may not be a good thing to compress all your data. For instance a serialized empty array may be several dozen of bytes long as the name of the underlying class is in the serialized data stream. Also most compression algorithm are designed to remove redundancy from large data blocks. On small to medium Java objects youll probably have very little or no gain at all.pli lipJava ZIP also offers a alternative. Java supports ZipStream. All you need is to serialize your object into byte array and then zip it.pli lipUse ByteArrayOutputStream, DataStream, ZipOutputStream. But some argue that zip DEFLATE algorithm is quite old and the algorithm used in gzip, bzip2 or 7ziplzma are probably more efficient. you will get MUCH better compression using bzip, or tar.gz. Apache Compress is the easiest way to work with those formats, if youre willing to accept the extra JAR dependencies.pli ul

This way Fedora opened the File Roller, select the destination folder and start to compress. No alarms or warnings appeared. After some time appear a message saying that was not enough disk space. Ok, I wonder why it dont warn me before....but Ok, its a compress process, maybe its complicated to determine the size of the final compressed file....whatever..p  pBut now, it appears for me that my disk is full. The place I choose for destination is empty Ive already tried look for hidden files also. I was thinking about the File Roller compress my files in a temp folder and after that he copies to my destination folder. How the error happen, this temp files are lost somewhere filling my disk.p  pAnyone know how do I clean this filesp  pEdit Its more probable that this junk files really exists Or could be just the system that dont refreshed the file system If so, how do I recreate this index of my diskp  pThanks a lot. Im stuck at the moment in my work with this disk space problem....p

Positive 76 pI am in the middle of developing an app for android  ios and web. User can upload a video thats meant for a group. And members of the group should be able to see the video or download it like whatsapp does it. I dont mind compressing the video with little loss. Speed of upload and download is crucial. What are my best options I am thinking of using youtube APIs to do everything as it might make things much easier. And I hope I can make the video private while uploading using APIs.  But this means the data is with youtube server. I prefer that data sits on our server. What are my other options  Any library  SDK that works with both ios and android  I dont have a whole lot of time to develop this. Any help is greatly appreciated.p
Positive 76 pFirst, a small number of active users from a total of K users are set to respectively transmit a frame of convolutionallyencoded binary bits, optionally interleaved, then mapped following the Binary PhaseShift Keying BPSK constellation. Inactive users are set to transmit allzero frames, thus forming an augmented BPSK constellation 0, 1. All frames to be transmitted are then spread using bipolarvalued PseudoNoise PN spreading sequences before they go through their respective wireless channels modeled as i.i.d. Rayleigh distributed channels with an exponentiallydecaying power delay profile where the expected decay is known.

Positive 76 pstrongSummarystrong I need a PNG writer and for various reasons I had to make it from scratch. I dont need to compress the image data, so I implemented PNG using the nocompression deflate algorithm. Rendering fails for images requiring multiple deflate blocks, seemingly because it ignores block lengths.p  pstrongIssuestrong When I have a tiny image written with a single deflate block, the resulting image is exactly what it is supposed to be all pixels correct, no errors when checked with a hrefhttpgnuwin32.sourceforge.netpackagespngutils.htm relnofollowpngchecka. However, as soon as I use multiple deflate blocks the resulting image is wrong because deflate blocks are being read past their lengths though pngcheck still shows no errors. Looking at the raw data in a hex editor seems to show that everything is to spec according to a hrefhttpwww.libpng.orgpubpngspec1.2png1.2pdg.html relnofollowlibpnga, RFC 1950, and RFC 1951.p  pstrongExample Datastrong I generated a 3x1 RGBA image where the pixel colors are, from left to right, codefb,02,03,facode, code01,fc,03,facode, code01,02,fd,facode. I then wrote them to file with either an 8byte or 64byte maximum deflate block length.

In the 8byte block image, the length for the first block is 8 just as it should be. The 8 bytes after the length complement in italics above are indeed the values they are supposed to be, and the 9th byte equals 1 and starts the final block. However, that 1 is being interpreted as a color value the alpha for the second pixel instead of as the start of the next blockp  pPresumably there is something that Im missing about the structure of deflate blocks. Am I being dumb and making a mistake, or did I misunderstand the specsp

Positive 76 pI am confused about the interpretation of the minimum description length of an alphabet of two symbols.p  pTo be more concrete, suppose that we want to encode a binary string where 1s occur with probability 0.80 for instance, here is a string of length 40, with 32 1s and 8 0sp  p1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1p  pFollowing standard MDL analysis, we can encode this string using prefix codes like Huffmans and the code of encoding this string would be log0.8  32  log0.2  8, which is lower than duplicating the string without any encoding. p  pIntuitively, it is cheaper to encode this string than some string where 1s and 0s occur with equal probability. However, in practice, I dont see why this would be the case. At the very least, we need one bit to distinguish between 1s and 0s. I dont see how prefix codes could do better than just writing the binary string without encoding.p  pCan someone help me clarify this, pleasep

Positive 76 pI need to read several text files from our Siebel server and attach them to an email. However, some of these files may be too big to mail them. Compressing them would definitely solve the problem, given that they are plain text files.p  pWhich leads to my question is there any builtin business service  workflow  whatever in Siebel 7.8, which offers compressing functionality I dont care about the file format zip, tar.gz, 7z..., as long as I can extract the files whitout Siebel no .SAF format, please.p  pThere are 1.041 vanilla business services in our repository. One might think that, with such a huge number, there should be one to compress files, right I hope so... I still havent found it yet, though.p  pI know I could write a really simple Java class to perform the compression, and then consume it from Siebel as a Java BS... but Id rather avoid this option if there is an alternative.p

Positive 76 pI need to greatly reduce the filesize of a large set of jpg images created by a java program. I thought video should be best choice and in particular mp4. but, I dont know why a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32190433jcodecmp4compressisincreasingfilesizethe size of mp4 video with h.264 codec is bigger than the size of the image seta in the only implementation I found, so I made my own archive format that is basically the imageset merged together in 1 file and compressed with a hrefhttpsgithub.comxerialsnappyjava relnofollowSnappya, plus the info for split them again. so the question arep  ol liDoes anyone know a good compression video encoder for javali liDoes anyone know why in that implementation the file growth and avoid itli licurrently basing on test I found snappy is reducing size by 1520, i know that jpg is already a compressed format and miracles in further compressing cant be done but im trying, so if the previous 2 point fail, someone know how minimize the file size in other ways than videoli ol  pEDIT the jpg single images are already greatly compressed so i dont need a jpg algorithm.p

Positive 76 pI am curious about how a file compression program writes the compressed file size or the compressed checksum of the file in the file header i.e. at the beginning in the compressed file. It would be easy if the file is small so the file can be compressed in memory and then header calculated and written followed by the file data. But if the file is very large say a few GB then how will it prepend the file header in the beginning of the compressed file since the compressed file size will only become available after the whole file has been processedp  pDoes it copy the file compressed data to a new file after writing the header in the new filep

Positive 76 pI have the following problem. I am using WS2811 diodes, Arduino Due and node.js to my project. I want to stream video from a device connected to a node.js server and show it on array of diodes. Right now I am able to capture video from any device with browser and camera, change resolution of the video to this desired by me 15x10 and create String chain containing informations of all colors R,G,B of all diodes. I am sending it from node.js server to arduino though serial port with baud rate 115200. Unfortunately sending process it is too slow. I would like it to refresh the LED array at least 10 times per second. So I was wondering maybe to compress this string which I am sending to arduino, when it gets there decompress it, and set colors to diodes. Maybe you guys have some experience with similar project and advice me what to do.p  pFor handling diodes I am using adafruitneopixel library.p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 76 pTheres a lot of literature on collision detection, and Ive read at least a big enough portion of it to be fairly familiar with most techniques. However, theres something that has eluded me for a while, and I figured, since StackOverflow provides access to a large group of brilliant minds at once, Id ask here first before digging around in the bookshelf.p  pIn this day and age, more and more work is being delegated to GPU rather than CPU, and in a lot of cases this is a good thing. For example, there are geometry shaders to create new geometry, or slightly less new, but still quite fascinating vertex shaders to which you can through a bunch of vertexes at, and something elegant will come out of it. What I was considering though, as these primitives exists only on the graphics hardware, how would you perform reliable collision detection with these primitives Lets assume I have some kind of extremely simplified mesh which is displaced in a vertex shader I dont have a concrete problem, Im more playing with the idea, and I havent gotten very deep into geometry shaders yet.p  pWhat Ive considered so far is separate rendering passes from suitable angles with shading more or less turned off, and perhaps lower resolution mesh, rendering the inside with faces flipped inward of my second primitive along with the mesh I want to test against, and executing an occlusion query for the mesh. If the mesh is completely occluded thered be no intersection. This would of course require that my second primitive is convex.p  pSomehow I get the feeling that this kind of test will be extremely expensive as the number of primitives increase even if a large portion can be culled directly. Does anyone else have another idea or technique Im more familiar with opengl and cg than directx, but if you have some examples or so in directx, I guess Ill be able to figure out the opengl counterparts.p  pAll ideas are appreciated, so please brainstorm. p

Negative 76 pAs a programmer, I have bought wholeheartedly into the TDD philosophy and take the effort to make extensive unit tests for any nontrivial code I write. Sometimes this road can be painful behavioral changes causing cascading multiple unit test changes high amounts of scaffolding necessary, but on the whole I refuse to program without tests that I can run after every change, and my code is much less buggy as a result.p  pRecently, Ive been playing with Haskell, and its resident testing library, QuickCheck. In a fashion distinctly different from TDD, QuickCheck has an emphasis on testing invariants of the code, that is, certain properties that hold over all or substantive subsets of inputs. A quick example a stable sorting algorithm should give the same answer if we run it twice, should have increasing output, should be a permutation of the input, etc. Then, QuickCheck generates a variety of random data in order to test these invariants.p  pIt seems to me, at least for pure functions that is, functions without side effectsand if you do mocking correctly you can convert dirty functions into pure ones, that invariant testing could supplant unit testing as a strict superset of those capabilities. Each unit test consists of an input and an output in imperative programming languages, the output is not just the return of the function but also any changed state, but this can be encapsulated. One could conceivably created a random input generator that is good enough to cover all of the unit test inputs that you would have manually created and then some, because it would it would generate cases that you wouldnt have thought of if you find a bug in your program due to some boundary condition, you improve your random input generator so that it generates that case too.p  pThe challenge, then, is whether or not its possible to formulate useful invariants for every problem. Id say it is its a lot simpler once you have an answer to see if its correct than it is to calculate the answer in the first place. Thinking about invariants also helps clarify the specification of a complex algorithm much better than ad hoc test cases, which encourage a kind of casebycase thinking of the problem. You could use a previous version of your program as a model implementation, or a version of a program in another language. Etc. Eventually, you could cover all of your former testcases without having to explicitly code an input or an output.p  pHave I gone insane, or am I on to somethingp

The problem is that it seems to kill the performace  Ive done a simple measuring using codeCFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrentcode and the codeplaycode message seems to take somewhere from 9 to 30ms to finish.

Negative 76 pI have been reading up on multiple PHP frameworks, especially the Zend Framework but I am getting confused about the proper way to go forward.p  pZend Framework does not use ActiveRecords but instead uses the Table Data Gateway and Row Data Gateway pattern, and uses a DataMapper to map the contents of the Row Data Gateway to the model, because ActiveRecord breaks down when your models dont have a 11 mapping to your database tables. There is an a hrefhttpframework.zend.comdocsquickstartcreateamodelanddatabasetableexample of thisa in the Zend Quickstart guide.p  pTo me, their example looks very bloated with a ton of getters and setters all over the place. I came across various blog posts about Domain Driven Design arguing that using so many getters and setters is bad practice because it exposes all the inner model data to the outside, so it has no advantage over public attributes. a hrefhttpwww.javaworld.comjavaworldjw092003jw0905toolbox.htmlHere is one examplea.p  pMy question If you remove those getters and setters, how will you render your views At some point the data has to hit the view so you can actually show something to the user. Following the DDD advice seems to break the separation between M and V in MVC. Following the MVC and Zend example seems to break DDD and leaves me typing up a whole lot of getters, setters and DataMappers for all my models. Aside from being a lot of work it also seems to violate DRY.p  pI would really appreciate some links to good examples or more information about how it all fits together. Im trying to improve my achitecture and design skills here.p

Negative 76 pIm experiencing a mysterious to me error when sending emails through a SMTPserver from an ASP.NET web application. I get the famous error unable to relay for xxxyyy.zzz. Whats mysterious to me is that when I cut and paste the exact same code that sends the email into an usual .NET Windows Forms application, send the email with this application, it all works just fine. This made me think that perhaps the problem is that the ASP.NET application runs as NETWORK SERVICE while the Windows Forms application runs on a domain user account, but it turns out that I have another ASP.NET application sending email through the same SMTPserver running under NETWORK SERVER at the same IIS, and this application does not experience this problem. p  pIve further tried to send emails through the SMTPserver manually by telnet the SMTPserver on port 25 and running the SMTPprotocol manually, and it all works fine. The SMTPserver is not configured with any kind of authentication or SSL. p  pAnother mysterious fact is that the ASP.NET application can send emails from an address within the same domain to an email address within the same domain, but not to any address outside of the domain. But the Windows Forms application, that uses the exact same code, can send emails from any address to any address both within AND outside of the domain.p  pSo to summarizep  ul liThe ASP.NET application can send emails from addresses within the domain to addresses within the domain, but not to addresses outside of the domain.li liA Windows Forms application running the same code on the same computer can send emails from ANY address to ANY address.li liAnother ASP.NET application on the same IIS running under the same account NETWORK SERVICE can send emails using the same SMTPserver from ANY address to ANY address.li liThere is no authentication configured on the SMTPServer.li liBoth the ASP.NET application and the Windows Forms application utilizes the System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient class to send a System.Net.Mail.MailMessage.li ul  pThe code that sends the email massage isp  precodeprivate void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e                      MailMessage mesasge  new MailMessagetxtFrom.Text, txtTo.Text, Test mail, txtBody.Text             SmtpClient client  new SmtpClient             if string.IsNullOrEmptytxtUserName.Text  Is false since txtUserName.Text is empty                 client.Credentials  new System.Net.NetworkCredentialtxtUserName.Text, txtPassword.Text             client.EnableSsl  false             client.Host  txtServer.Text             client.Port  25             try                              client.Sendmesasge                          catch Exception ex                              txtResponse.Text  ex.Message                       codepre  pAs far as I can understand, this should be a matter of configuration rather than coding issues.

Negative 76 pI have a dynamic query which returns a DataTable. This DataTable will contain a varying number of columns depending on the selection used in the query. I want an efficient way of filtering the records in the DataTable.  p  pFor Examplebr The DataTable contains columns  A, B, C and D  p  pI need to query this data at several points in my program.br At some point I may need records where A10 and C40. At another point I may need records where Alt10 and D90 etc. etc. The selects are dynamic, I do not now what Columns or values are needed until the code is executing.  p  pI could simply use a DataTable Filter and build the selection string dynamically. I have no problem with this. However I was wondering if using LINQ would be more applicable. I am completely new to LINQ and would like to use it but dont know its capabilities. p  pAt present I am using a DataTable but in future this may change to a collection of Objectsp  pYours ideas please. p
Negative 76 pIn short, I am writing an Android application that I want to have pull data from a remote database. I was looking into .NET web services, but this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions297586howtocallwebservicewithandroidhttpstackoverflow.comquestions297586howtocallwebservicewithandroida question pointed me away from that direction.p  pIs REST as simple as writing some short PHP to handle something like a hrefhttpswww.example.comdata.phpemployeemichael relnofollowhttpswww.example.comdata.phpemployeemichaela and have it return relevant XML or JSON data That to me seems like what has been described to me by various sites and videos. Also, is this the best way to do this kind of operation over the internet for mobile devices, desktop applications, etcp
Negative 76 pWe use a custom urlrewiter on our .net sites and set a wildcard mapping to redirect any request to the .net isapi filter for processing.p  pThis works fine but we have noticed an issue with our custom 404 pages not working and iis handling the 404s instead.  We configure the custom errors in the web.config as followsp  precodeltcustomErrors modeOngt   lterror statusCode404 redirect404.aspxgt   lterror statusCode500 redirect500.htmgt ltcustomErrorsgt codepre  pI noticed that the custom errorpage is served if I request an page with an aspx extension www.mysite.commadeuppage.aspx but not an invalid directory www.mysite.commadeupdirectory.  I guess this is because IIS is passing aspx pages to the .NET enginbe for handling but I thought the wildcard mapping would pass directorys toop  pThis could be fixed by me configuring the custom error page in IIS but I would rather this be configured in the web.cofig if possible  Any ideasp

Negative 76 pLets say I have a mysql table, called codefoocode with a foreign key codeoptionidcode constrained to the codeoptioncode table.  When I create a codefoocode record, the user may or may not have selected an option, and no option is a viable selection.  What is the best way to differentiate between null i.e. the user hasnt made a selection yet and no option i.e. the user selected no optionp  pRight now, my plan is to insert a special record into the codeoptioncode table.  Lets say that winds up with an id of 227 this table already has a number of records at this point, so 1 isnt available.  I have no need to access this record at a database level, and it would act as nothing more than a placeholder that the foreign key in the codefoocode table can reference.p  pSo do I just hardcode 227 in my codebase when Im creating foo records where the user has selected no option  The hardcoded id seems sloppy, and leaves room for error as the code is maintained down the road, but Im not really sure of another approach.p

Negative 76 pI noticed that many times while developing for an iPhone 3G, BSD socket functions will simply fail.  I also noticed at the time, the 3G antenna wasnt even ON, nor was there WIFI Access to back up the network call So it seems ridiculous that it doesnt turn on to support the network request..  This information was verified with an app from Apple in the SDK called Connectivity Test, or something of the sort.p  pBasically if you load Safari or something, then quickly load up the App it would be fine.. Of course thats not ideal.  Apparently, to apple, gethostbyname or something of the sort is by no means a reason to turn on the Antenna.p  pI contacted Apple about this, and they said that the BSD functions do not switch the Antenna on, but calling all of the ObjectiveC CFNetwork functions do.  I want portable code, so is there a way to keep my existing BSD setup  I really dislike coding in ObjectiveC, so if anyone knows a work around, that would be awesome.p

Negative 76 pI am just starting with ASP.Net. I copied a excoworkers code from .Net 1.1 era and it has a codeResponse.Endcode in case of an error.

Negative 76 pI have a UINavigationController with a root view controller and then I push a UIViewController onto the navigation controllers stack.  When the user taps the backBarButtonItem Id like to be able to have an alert view pop up if there are certain conditions met and cancel the pop of the view controller.  For example, the user can make certain selections but some combination of them may be invalid so I want to notify them to make changes.p  pI know that I can empreventem the user from making an invalid combination or have an alert view pop up when the invalid combination is selected but Id rather not do that. The user may be changing selections and may be aware that a certain combination is invalid but Id rather let them select something that makes the combination invalid then go change something else and notify them if they havent made changes before trying to go to the previous screen. For example, if I prevent them from selecting something that makes an invalid combination then they may have to scroll up on a screen, change something, then scroll back down instead of making a selection then scrolling up and changing something.p  pUsing codeviewWillDisappearcode doesnt work because, although I can produce an alert view, I cannot figure out a way to prevent the pop from occurring. The alert view displays but the view controller still pops and they are back to the root view controller with the alert view displaying.p  pIs there a way to prevent the pop from occurring  If not, is this something worth filing a bug report about or is this unnecessary andor esotericp

Negative 76 pI am working on a program, which handles a lot of objects and data. As I would be able to inject manipulations by having some kind of API to my application. As the application itself does the management of the objects and such, I wonder how this can be implemented. For example, the Unity3D and Panda3D engines allow a variety of languages, such as ECMA or Python for scripting. I am not looking for a gaming scripting language to put in, but pointers on how to support various scripting languages. p  pFor the sake of argument, lets say my program has objects that are of the class Cube. A cube has class methods such as rotate, move, transform and properties like color, center, size. Now, I would like to give my user the possibility to use for example JavaScript to manipulate the object. My core program however is written in Ruby.p  ol liWould I have to write an entire package that will evaluate the user code and its syntax as implement an own version of JavaScript from scratch Or are there existing packages, skeletons, frameworks, gems, etc.li liHow would I implement security to give the scripting language only to the classes that are allowed to be manipulated for example, an attribute that marks the class as manipulable.li ol  pI have always wondered how Enterprise applications did this trick and Game engines too..., so thank you for the help and feedback.p
Negative 76 pI am caching objects that are being sent to my component in an asynchronous way. In other words, the order in which these objects arrive is unpredictable. To avoid any issues, I have included a version attribute to my objects which basically is a timestamp. The idea is that any object that arrives with a version thats older than the one that has already been cached, it can be discarded.p  pThe Element class of EHCache which wraps objects in an EHCache seems to facilitate this apart from a key and value, the constructor can take a longbased version. I cannot make this work in the way Id expect it to work though. The following code snippet demonstrates my problem Using EHCache 2.1.1p  precodepublic static void mainString[] args      final CacheManager manager  CacheManager.create     final Cache testCache  new Cachenew CacheConfigurationtest, 40     manager.addCachetestCache      final String key  key     final Element elNew  new Elementkey, NEW, 2L     testCache.putelNew     final Element elOld  new Elementkey, OLD, 1L     testCache.putelOld      System.out.printlnCache content     for Object k  testCache.getKeys          System.out.printlntestCache.getk       codepre  pId expect the code above to cause the cached value to be NEW, instead, OLD is printed. If you play a bit with the order in which elements are inserted, youll find that the last one that has been inserted is the one that will remain in cache. Versioning seems to be ignored.p  pAm I not using the versioningfeature properly, or is it perhaps not intended to be used for this purpose Can anyone recommend alternativesp

Negative 76 pI want to sync the Core Data on iPhone with MongoDB on Sinatra server.p  pWhen the iPhone gets a message from the Node.js chat server, the message contains the senders BSON ObjectId a string. For the iPhone to store this message, I find the user with that same Id in Core Data. I want to be able to do something like codeobjectWithIDcode. In other words, I want to set the NSManagedObjectIDs to be the same as the MongoDB BSON ObjectIds. The other thing I would check is if there are no users with the senders id in the managedObjectContext, I will fetch him from the persistentStore, and if hes not there, Ill create him. This is a lot to do just to maintain the relationship between Message and Sender. Maybe I should just store the sender attribute of the Message object as his BSON ObjectId as a string instead of as a User NSManagedObject.p  pWhat do you recommend Should I just use MongoDB on the iPhone too I just realized theres an ObjectiveC driver for it. But I was just starting to get the hang of Core Data, and it has cool things like undo support that I might want to use... Right now, Im just using it for simple fetching amp persistent storage, so I could replace it. But I plan to implement undo support in the future, just because I think thats good usability. I prefer the option to undo than having to answer a confirmation popup, e.g., I like how GMail lets you undo a send or undo a deletion of messages, etc.p  pThanksp  pMattp

Negative 76 pSuppose I have a 2D array like the followingp  precodeGACTG AGATA TCCGA codepre  pEach array element is taken from a small finite set in my case, DNA nucleotides  codeA, C, G, Tcode.  I would like to randomly shuffle this array somehow while preserving both row emandem column nucleotide frequencies.  Is this possible  Can it be done efficientlyp  pstrong[EDIT]strong By this I mean I want to produce a new matrix where each row has the same number of codeAcodes, codeCcodes, codeGcodes and codeTcodes as the corresponding row of the original matrix, and where each column has the same number of codeAcodes, codeCcodes, codeGcodes and codeTcodes as the corresponding column of the original matrix.  strongPermuting the rows or columns of the original matrix will not achieve this in general.strong  E.g. for the example above, the top row has 2 codeGcodes, and 1 each of codeAcode, codeCcode and codeTcode if this row was swapped with row 2, the top row in the resulting matrix would have 3 codeAcodes, 1 codeGcode and 1 codeTcode.p  pIts simple enough to preserve just column frequencies by shuffling a column at a time, and likewise for rows.  But doing this will in general alter the frequencies of the other kind.p  pstrongMy thoughts so farstrong  If its possible to pick 2 rows and 2 columns so that the 4 elements at the corners of this rectangle have the patternp  precodeXY YX codepre  pfor some pair of distinct elements codeXcode and codeYcode, then replacing these 4 elements withp  precodeYX XY codepre  pwill maintain both row and column frequencies.  In the example at the top, this can be done for at least rows 1 and 2 and columns 2 and 5 whose corners give the 2x2 matrix codeAGGAcode, and for rows 1 and 3 and columns 1 and 4 whose corners give codeGTTGcode.  Clearly this could be repeated a number of times to produce some level of randomisation.p  pGeneralising a bit, any subrectangle induced by a subset of rows and a subset of columns, in which the frequencies of all rows are the same and the frequencies of all columns are the same, can have both its rows and columns permuted to produce a valid complete rectangle.  Of these, only those subrectangles in which at least 1 element is changed are actually interesting.  Big questionsp  ol listrongAre all valid complete matrices reachable by a series of such subrectangle rearrangementsstrong  I suspect the answer is yes.li listrongAre all valid subrectangle rearrangements decomposable into a series of 2x2 swapsstrong  strong[EDIT]strong a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5086872isitpossibletoshufflea2dmatrixwhilepreservingrowandcolumnfrequencies50877865087786mhums counterexamplea shows that the answer is emnoem.

Also Im concerned that only 2x2 swaps are considered.p  pFinally, I would ideally like a solution that can be proven to select a matrix uniformly at random from the set of all matrices having identical row frequencies and column frequencies to the original.

I am coding sites on my laptop and in addition to Dropbox I would like to have a backup of everything that Ive done stored elsewhere.  This is when I learned about git.  I understand that it keeps track of all of the changes made and committed, but what happens to the actual files that Ive changed  What Im asking is probably best explained by an example.p  pI have set up a git repo on my laptop to manage all of the changes made to codeMySitecode and all of its files and folders codeindex.phpcode, codeimgcode, codecsscode, etc..  I have also created a codebarecode git repository on a flash drive.  I have codepushcodeed the original repo to that location.  I am able to use codegit logcode to successfully view the history, but when I access the flash drive I notice that the contents of codeMySitecode are not there or at least viewable.  What do you suggest that I do to be able to work from the flash drive and then later push those changes to the laptop while still being able to work from the laptop as I am used top

Negative 76 pI am writing a greasemonkey script. Recently i had this same problem twice and i have no idea why is this happening.p  precodefunction colli ..... var oPriorityMass  bynIDmassadderPrioritymy own document.getElementById function var aPriorities  [] if oPriorityMass      for var cEntry0 cEntry lt oPriorityMass.childNodes.length cEntry          var sCollNumber  oPriorityMass.childNodes[cEntry].getAttributecoll         if bynIDadder  sCollNumber  check.checked             aPriorities.pushparseIntsCollNumber       .....  codepre  pSo the mystery of this is, one day i had codeoPriorityMasscode named as codeoPririotycode. It was working fine, but the whole function was not yet complete and i started working on another functions for my script. These functions have no connection with each other. p  pFew days later i decided to go back to my function in the above example and finish it. I ran a test on it without modifying anything and got an error in the firefoxs 4 javascript error console saying that codeoPriority.chilNodes[cEntry] is undefinedcode. NOTE, few days back i have tested it exactly the same way and there was no such problem at all.p  pOk, so, i decided to rename codeoPrioritycode to codeoPriorityMasscode. Magically, problem got solved.p  pAt first i thought, maybe there was some conflict of 2 objects, with the same name being used in different functions, which somehow continued to live even outside of function scope. My script is currently over 6000 lines big, but i did a search and found out that codeoPrioritycode was not mentioned anywhere else but in this exact function.p  pCan somebody tell me, how and why is this happening I mentioned same thing happened twice now and they happened in different functions, but the same problem codenode.childNodes[c] is undefinedcode yet codenodecode is not null and codenode.childNodes.lengthcode show correct child count. What is going on How do i avoid such problemsp  pThank youp  pstrongEDITstrong The error given by error console is codeError uncaught exception TypeError oPriorityMass.childNodes[cEntry] is undefinedcode  p  pIn response to Brocks comment codeGMlogoPriorityMass.childNodes[cEntry]code returns codeundefinedcode as a message. So codenode.childNodes[c]code is the thing that is undefined in general. p  pMy script creates a div window. Later, the above function uses elements in this div. Elements do have unique IDs and i am 100 sure the original site dont know about them. My script has a startstop button to run one or the other function when i need to. I have been refreshing the page and running my script function now. I have noticed that sometimes but not always script will fail with the described error on the first run, however, if i run it again without refreshing the page it starts working.p  pThe page has a javascript that modifies it. It changes some of its element widths so it changes when the browser is resized. But i know it has no effect on my div as it is left unchanged when i resize browser.p  pstrongEDIT2strong p  precodefunction bynIDsID      return top.document.getElementByIdnssID  function nssText      return gsScriptName    sText  codepre  pns function just adds the script name in front of the ID. I use it when creating HTML element so my elements never have the same id as the web page. So bynID is simple function that saves some typing time when i need to get element by ID.p  pI have modified my codecollicode function to include check p  precodeif oPriorityMass      if oPriorityMass.childNodes[0]          GMlogRetrying         setTimeoutloadPage,2000         return          for var cEntry0 cEntry lt oPriorityMass.childNodes.length cEntry          var sCollNumber  oPriorityMass.childNodes[cEntry].getAttributecoll         if bynIDadder  sCollNumber  check.checked             aPriorities.pushparseIntsCollNumber       codepre  pThe codeloadPagecode function does 1 AJAX call, then i run few XPATH queries on it, but the actual contents are never appendedshown on the page, just kept inside codedocument.createElementdivcode, then this function calls codecollicode. So now, as i have modified my function, i checked the error console and saw that it may take up to 5 tries for it to start working correctly. 5 x 2seconds, thats 10 seconds.

WindowsFormsApplication1.CA.X cannot implement an interface member because it is not public.p  pI realize I can make the methods public or do an explicit implementation and omit the internal and public modifiers, but Im simply confused as to why it works with the two classes it works with and yet I seem to be unable to replicate it anywhere else.p  pButchering the code a bit because its confidential, this is one of the ones that actually works in my project.p  precodeinternal interface IScanner      void SetHardwareHardware hardware     void Start     void PauseScan     void ResumeScan     void Stop     bool InScan  get      event ScanCompleteHandler ScanComplete  codepre  pThen I have the classp  precodeinternal class MyScanner  IScanner      internal void SetHardwareHardware hardware             ...           internal void Start              ...           internal void Stop              ...           internal void PauseScan              ...           internal void ResumeScan              ...           internal bool InScan              get                      ...                    internal event ScanCompleteHandler ScanComplete  codepre  pTo make things even stranger, I created another internal class called Temp.

Negative 76 pI am working with someone elses code and trying to make some modifications.  So what Im needing to do is take the followingp  precodeRemoteFileDP remoteFile  new DPFactory.CreateRemoteFileDPconfigData codepre  pAnd change it so that remoteFile can equal what is in a string variable.  To further explain let me give some more of the codep  precodeConfigDP configData  new ConfigDP codepre  pSo the statement above is executed before the remoteFile statement and ConfigDP is has two classes above it abstract Config and then its base abstract ConfigBase.  DP is also the child of two abstract classes above it abstract RemoteFile and abstract RemoteFileBase.p  pFrom my understanding remoteFile is the result of data extracted from a database query, stored into a list or a Hashtable sorry just an intern so Im working through this.  p  pThe reason I need remoteFile to accept a string value is because there are MANY methods that utilize the information in remoteFile and I would like to avoid having to create a WHOLE BUNCH of overloaded methods that accept a string value instead of RemoteFileDP remoteFile.p  pSo if I can take a string value like p  precodestring locationDirectory codepre  pwhich is passed in from another method and then have something similar to the followingp  precodeRemoteFileDP remoteFile  locationDirectory codepre  pthen all other methods using remoteFile will not have to be overloaded or changed.  p  pSorry for all the detail but this is my first time posting so I hope I provided enough information.

The problem is that I dont want to modify the classes generated by L2S because they are automatically generated and any modifications will be lost later. I will be making changes so this and making changes to auto generated code is redundant.p  pBefore doing the L2S, I had the database built, and a bunch of entity classes all pre designed using inheritance which I had to delete because they caused conflicts with the L2S classes. The L2S autogenerated classes are far to meessy for me and I would like to be able to replace their properties, constructors, and add methods. Or at least rename or extend them somewhere neater where I can re implement my inheritance structure.p  pThe methodology I am using is simple. A set of classes for the UI. A set of Control classes to handle the business logic, and a set of Entity classes to interface with the DB. But the whole L2S automated class generation is getting in my way of this by replacing my entity classes.p  pAnyway, My first problem is I want to display the Job Title one field form the Job Details table in the list box for each record. When the selection is changed in the listbox, the relevant record will be accessed and will fill in a bunch of text boxes that will allow the user to edit that record.p  pAny help with this would be really appreicated.

Negative 76 pIm looking at adding Python support to my game engine project, with the intent of using it as a scripting language for much of the game logic and world building.

Ive already gone through the relevant documentation on the Python site, and Im fairly confident that I understand the basic requirements for embedding Python and communicating back and forth between Python and the core engine components.p  pIm going to embedding Python into the engine itself, rather than compiling the engine as a Python module, since one of my target platforms is the iPhone.p  pOne question I havent been able to answer myself is how to introduce structure to the C modules. For example, Id like to be able to do something along the lines ofp  precodefrom engine.scene import skyobject import engine.core.platforminfo codepre  pWould you just create a single engine module, and then add some sort of sub module for scene, core, etc Or should there be separate modules for each of the exposed components, i.e. defining the skyobject module with the name engine.scene.skyobject p  pAny insight on this is appreciated.p

Negative 76 pI imagined this would be supersimple, but it is eluding me so far.

Modifying the output strings i.e. including div tags only seems to break them, although my JS knowledge is not great enough to understand why a guess, is that the scripts seem to target a certain div class and inject the appropriate code.  Perhaps introducing new divs screws this upp  pI guess my question would have to be... what is the easiest way to implement a countdown to a specific date, which can be styled with CSS, although if you know of an existing plug in that does this, I will love you foreverp

Negative 76 pstrongThis is a designalgorithm question.strong Heres the outline of my scenariop  ul liI have a large table say, 5 mil. rows of data which Ill call strongCarsstrongli liThen I have an application, which performs a codeSELECT code on this strongCarsstrong table, taking all the data and packaging it into a single data file which is then uploaded somewhere.li liThis data file generated by my application represents a snapshot, what the table looked like at an instant in time.li liThe table strongCarsstrong, however, is updated sporadically by another process, regardless of whether the application is currently generating a package from the table or not. There currently is no synchronization.li ul  pstrongMy problemstrongp  pThis table strongCarsstrong is becoming too big to do a single codeSELECT code against. When my application retrieves all this data at once, it quickly overwhelms the memory capacity for my machine lets say, 2GB. Also, simply performing chained codeSELECTcodes with LIMIT or OFFSET fails the condition of synchronization the table is frequently updated and I cant have the data change between SELECT calls.p  pstrongWhat Im looking forstrongp  pA way to pull the entirety of this table into an application whose memory capacity is smaller than the data, assuming the data size could approach infinity. Particularly, how do I achieve a paginationsegmented effect for my SQL selects i.e. Make recurring calls with a page number to retrieve the next segment of data. The ideal solution allows for scalability in data size.p  pFor the sake of simplifying my scenario, we can assume that when given a segment of data, the application can processwrite it then free up the memory used before requesting the next segment.p  pAny suggestions you may be able to provide would be most helpful.

Negative 76 pFollowing on from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9201205simpleapplicationarchitectureadvicethisa question, I now have the following structurep  pWolfie.Core  Contains business logic amp entities,  also contains repository interfaces eg IUserRepository  Classes that need to access the repository are using constructor injection.p  pWolfie.Data  References Wolfie.Core and has a UserRepository implementing IUserRepositoryp  pSo Im happy with this so far.  Core doesnt know anything about data implementation and therefore isnt dependent on anything.p  pThe stumbling block I get to is in my Web layer.p  pMy Web project references my Core project. I can then new up a Core class, say User, but I have to pass a concrete implementation of IUserRepository into it.  So I need to reference my Data project in my Web project, which seems wrong.  It now also looks like Web is dependent upon Data, which it shouldnt be.p  pSo, how can I inject my Core User class with the Data class withouth directly referencing Datap  pLook forward to your help.p

Negative 76 pA friend of mine and I have been using Google Docs for a while but it seems to be in the process of not supporting her browser anymore so as a fun project I thought I would try to imitate its functionality myself.p  pSo far Ive built a working facsimile in Codeigniter PHP that works fine on my machine locally however, Im trying to figure out if it is the most effective approachsafest to unleash on other people. Bear in mind that this is not meant to be a public service just for use by mostly 2 people, maybe 34 at most.p  pEach page of the app has a chat room and a view for whatever the current document is these are refreshed independently. The chat room basically pulls from a .txt file which is updated every time the user submits a message the chat refereshes via a JQuery AJAX call twice per second. So far Im not bothering with trying to note when a user left the chat, though I assume that would take a separate poll.p  pThe document view also updates via AJAX, but calling a controller function to ping a document MySQL database instead this call happens once per second as well as any time a user updates the document.p  pClearly this is going to have to be on a hosting plan that can accomodate traffic from the regular Javascript calls, but that aside, is this an acceptable way to approach the problem Will it cause undue strain on the client side or on the server Is there a better way Im very very selftaught, and while Im able to make something that works, I would love to have some confirmation that Im not taking the wrong approach.p  pThanks Hopefully this question makes sense glad to elaborate if necessary.p
Negative 76 pA friend of mine posed a seemingly innocuous Scala language question last week that I didnt have a good answer to whether theres an easy way to declare a collection of things belonging to some common typeclass.  Of course theres no firstclass notion of typeclass in Scala, so we have to think of this in terms of traits and context bounds i.e. implicits.p  pConcretely, given some trait codeT[]code representing a typeclass, and types codeAcode, codeBcode and codeCcode, with corresponding implicits in scope codeT[A]code, codeT[B]code and codeT[C]code, we want to declare something like a codeList[T[a] forAll  type a ]code, into which we can throw instances of codeAcode, codeBcode and codeCcode with impunity.  This of course doesnt exist in Scala a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7213676forallinscalaquestion last yeara discusses this in more depth.p  pThe natural followup question is how does Haskell do it  Well, GHC in particular has a type system extension called a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orgghcdocslatesthtmlusersguideothertypeextensions.htmlimpredicativepolymorphismimpredicative polymorphisma, described in the a hrefhttpresearch.microsoft.comenusumpeoplesimonpjpapersboxyboxyicfp.pdfBoxy Typesa paper.  In brief, given a typeclass codeTcode one can legally construct a list code[forall a. T a gt a]code.  Given a declaration of this form, the compiler does some dictionarypassing magic that lets us retain the typeclass instances corresponding to the types of each value in the list at runtime.p  pThing is, dictionarypassing magic sounds a lot like vtables.  In an objectoriented language like Scala, subtyping is a much more simple, natural mechanism than the Boxy Types approach.  If our codeAcode, codeBcode and codeCcode all extend trait codeTcode, then we can simply declare codeList[T]code and be happy.  Likewise, as Miles notes in a comment below, if they all extend traits codeT1code, codeT2code and codeT3code then I can use codeList[T1 with T2 with T3]code as an equivalent to the impredicative Haskell code[forall a. T1 a, T2 a, T3 a gt a]code.p  pHowever, the main, wellknown disadvantage with subtyping compared to typeclasses is tight coupling my codeAcode, codeBcode and codeCcode types have to have their codeTcode behavior baked in.  Lets assume this is a major dealbreaker, and I emcantem use subtyping.  So the middle ground in Scala is pimpsHHHHHimplicit conversions given some codeA gt Tcode, codeB gt Tcode and codeC gt Tcode in implicit scope, I can again quite happily populate a codeList[T]code with my codeAcode, codeBcode and codeCcode values...p  p... Until we want codeList[T1 with T2 with T3]code.  At that point, even if we have implicit conversions codeA gt T1code, codeA gt T2code and codeA gt T3code, we cant put an codeAcode into the list.  We could restructure our implicit conversions to literally provide codeA gt T1 with T2 with T3code, but Ive never seen anybody do that before, and it seems like yet another form of tight coupling.p  pOkay, so my question finally is, I suppose, a combination of a couple questions that were previously asked here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7266596whyavoidsubtypingwhy avoid subtypinga and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3848492advantagesofsubtypingovertypeclassesadvantages of subtyping over typeclassesa ... is there some unifying theory that says impredicative polymorphism and subtype polymorphism are one and the same  Are implicit conversions somehow the secret lovechild of the two  And can somebody articulate a good, clean pattern for expressing multiple bounds as in the last example above in Scalap

I have lots of items which fit in a range of compartments and I want to minimise the number of cases I need to take.p  p.p  pI have a set of N items of expensive electronic equipment which I want to pack into specially designed protective boxes. These boxes each have many compartments which can each fit a single item some of which are designed specially to fit a particular item ie, a camera shaped hole and some of which are generic a rectangular hole. I know in advance that there are C different sizes of compartment and what sizes these are.p  pThese boxes come in L different layouts, each with at least one compartment. A layout might be two large rectangular compartments and 4 small circular compartments.p  pEach compartment size is present on at least one layout, but I have items which dont suit any compartment size. Each item fits at least one compartment and may fit into multiple different compartments for example, my DSLR camera might be a tight fit in a medium rectangle compartment, a loose fit in a large rectangle and a perfect fit in a DSLR camera compartment, but wont fit in a small circle. To this end Ive made a list of which compartments are suitable for each item. p  pThe items are moderately heterogeneous  for example there may be 50 items of one size and 20 items of another size.p  pEach box has two costs Volume and Dollars however D proportional to V. I need to minimise one or both of these costs whilst fitting ALL of my items into the boxes. Due to the layouts of the boxes, the optimal solution may contain unused compartments. If two solutions have equal volume, select the one with the most unused compartments. Because each compartment is present on at least one layout and each item fits in at least one compartment, there is always a solution which fits all items.p  pNumber of items lt2000, average case 150. Number of compartments lt 1000. Number of layouts lt 1000.p  pAny ideas on this one Ive looked a bit at Knapsack and Bin Packing algorithms and Im not sure theyre the way to go. Help much appreciated.p

Negative 76 pIm building a website that will allow people to create content and place comments on content.p  pFor things like form label, buttons, and other static content, I can use a code.resxcode file. Ive done it before and it works out OK.p  pNow Im at a crossroad where I dont know which path to take. Both sound equally good to me, but since this is going to be my first foray into such territory, Id rather ask about any pitfalls I may not be taking into consideration.p  pHere are two options I thought of implementing. Both would solve my problem of localizing and presenting user generated content to my users.p  pstrongOption Astrongp  hr  pI would create multiple copies of the entire MVC3 application and place each localization into its own IIS Application.p  precodefoobar.com es.foobar.com ru.foobar.com codepre  pAnd I would just need to change a web.config file, to use a different database for each localization. p  pI see some problems with this, for examplep  ul lipIf a user logs into codefoobar.comcode and he were to visit his localized version of the site, he would not be logged in, since they are two completely separate applications.pli lipNo unified moderation tools. I would have to go inside each application, log in, access the admin panel and moderate from there.pli lipDifficult to push changesupdates to all versions of the page. Id have to manually go into each IIS application folder and copy the published files for each localized version.pli ul  pstrongOption Bstrongp  hr  pI would create a single MVC3 application and on the backend database create multiple fields for each localization.p  pFor examplep  precodeCar  CarID Name esName ruName Make esMake ruMake ..and so on.. codepre  pI would then somehow dynamically choose what fields to display based on what localization is chosen. Although Im not even sure this is possible since visiting a subdomain would take me to a completely different IIS application, unless I can bind a subdomain to point to the actual domain on my IIS. p  precodefoobar.com es.foobar.com ru.foobar.com codepre  pThe problem I see with this approach is that each table would be gargantuan in size, not only in number of fields, but also in number of records. Im not sure if this would be a problem.p  hr  pI would appreciate some suggestions on how to implement localization for user generated content in an MVC3 application.p  pMeaning, a user visiting the Spanish version codees.foobar.comcode would see other spanish content and comments made by users, and emnotem other versions. I strongdo notstrong mean translating their content and presenting it to the end user.p

Negative 76 pThe scenario is as follows an encryption key should be stored temporarily, so that multiple instances of an application can access it sequentially. After use, the key should of course be removed from the system. However, this imposes a problem. I accept that the system is vulnerable as long as the key is stored, but I want the system to be secure before and after the key is stored.p  pSimply writing the key to a file and overwriting it afterwards will not work in all cases some filesystem write changes to different parts of the disk, instead of to the same location. In that case, the key can still be retrieved afterwards. I cannot rely on the user having fulldisk encryption.p  pThen the most logical option seems to use an other process that keeps the key in memory, but the operating system might write the memory to the disk at certain points, resulting in the same problem as described above.p  pEncrypting the key is possible, but this is not more secure. The whole point of storing the key temporarily, is that the user need not type it in for every run of the program. This means that the key used to encrypt the key must also be stored somewhere, or it must be based on known data. If the key is stored, then of course we now have the problem of securely storing emthisem key. If it is based on known data, that means the key can be generated again when necessary, so encryption has little use.p  pI know some operating systems offer APIs to protect data, but this usually relies on generating an encryption key based on the user account information. Even if this is sessionspecific, the data will not be secure until the session ends which can be long after the key should be erased.p  pIs there any solution to this problem at all that does not rely on special hardware, does not require fulldisk encryption, etc. If there is not, what is the best I can do in this casep  pstrongEdit for clarificationstrong The key need not be secure when it is stored in memory at this point, the user should guarantee that no physical access is possible, and that the system is free of viruses. After the key has been used, it should be erased from the system, such that afterwards anyone with physical access, or any program, can inspect all memory and disks, and not find a single usable trace of the key any more.p

Negative 76 pIve been reading Myers book and came across the item on returning by referencepointer vs by value. The point is, if our function for example is like thisp  precodeClassAamp AddSomethingClassA classA    ClassA tempClassA   ... do something on tempClassA   return tempClassA  codepre  pThis would not work because we are returning a reference to a object that was created on the stack and it is dead now that the function is done.p  pHe gives two solutionsp  ol liUsing a local static ClassA inside the function. This has its problems but atleast we can be sure that object exists.li lipReturn as an objectp  precodeClassA AddSomethingClassA classA    ClassA tempClassA   ... do something on tempClassA   return tempClassA  codepreli ol  pNow if Im to dop  precodeClassA obj1 ClassA obj2  AddSomethingobj1 codepre  pMy confusion now is, when executing this linep  ol liA copy of tempClassA is made and passed to the copy constructor of ClassA to initialize obj2 ORli litempClassA is passed itself to the copy constructor of ClassA, because copy constructor takes a reference.li ol  pSo basically, whats passed to the copy constructor is a reference to tempClassA which was created in stack inside the function or a reference to a copy of tempClassA.p  pAlso, another question I have is, I have read that if I get a reference of a function local variable, in that case the local variable will not be deleted. For example,p  precodeClassA amp classRef  AddSomethingobj1 codepre  pIn this case, if AddSomething is returning a reference, then classRef not be pointing to a deleted reference because the local variable will be retained. Have I understood this correctlyp

Negative 76 pIm working on a project where we have a preexisting codeDataSetcode. We dont do any persistence type stuff. It just acts as a holder for data we read in from DB2.p  pI need to add a new column to one of the tables. I can open the designer and see the codeDataTablecode... I could manually add the column of course, but I was wondering if theres a way to tell Visual Studio to go get the table schema from DB2 and build the codeDataTablecode for me Itd be pretty cool if that would also handle easily updating it with schema changes in the future.

Negative 76 pI have 5 buttons, aligned in the right side of the view. I have a method, that takes the frame of the sender the button, creates a UIImageView with that frame, removes sender from superview and add the imageView at that location, and it works EXCEPT that those constraints mess me up.p  pIt seems like when i remove one of the buttons, it changes the size of all the others, and i cant explain why.p  pI would love to simply just remove the autolayout feature, but i would like to make the app for both iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 screen sizes.p  pSo what do i do herep  pIN SHORT I have 5 buttons on a view, a method creates a UIImageView with the sender buttons frame, remove button and add img view at that location. Works, but after changing 1 button the size of all the other buttons change. How to prevent this i think it is because they are aligned to each other in pairs.p  pThanksp  p EDIT Images of my setup and the constraints, not sure which one is giving me problems but maybe the bottom one, since it is linked to the other buttons. i DONT want my buttons to change size if i programmatically remove one of them, and that is whats happening. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuluYO.png altSetupp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKt3HZ.png altConstraintsp

Negative 76 pI have an application that I inherited and would like to improve. One area that I can cut a lot of code is codeDrag and Dropcode handling. In that, the application handles drag and drop of same type of objects but the code for it repeated over with slight variations and a lot of event wiring code. What I want to achieve is the followingp  ol liThe component a codeUserControlcode must have a way to declare within the form types of items  it supports dragging andor droppingli liThe component must have a way to broadcast that it accepted a dragged itemli liOnce the dragging starts, all the items that can accept the item being dragged should be notified that they dragging has startedli liThe dragging could be started from a contained control of the codeUserControlcodeli ol  pThat way I can handle both moving and copying of objects within a common class and without decorating the host form with the same boilerplate code.p  pIs that possible to achieve in codeWinFormscode Any code that already exists for thatp

Negative 76 pWhat are your best practising when you subclass UIView Im trying to do a view for a viewcontroller entirely in code, using the new ios 6 autolayout. So Ive subclassed UIView and setup the basic constraints in initWithFrame should I do this in updateConstraints. The problem is that I have an UILabel with dynamic text and variable width so I have to setup preferredMaxLayoutWidth after the constraints have determined a frame, so I think layoutSubviews is the best place to do that, but doing that results in a NSInternalInconsistencyException Auto Layout still required after executing layoutSubviews. MyViews implementation of layoutSubviews needs to call super. RuntimeError Before you asks Im sure I have called super in every method I overridden. Any ideap

I want to do that, but I need it to open a directory filled with .idl files and print which file it is and the size of it using sizeof..p  pIve tried to do it with dirent.h and opening the directory, and placing the contents into entdname, and then looking for the sizeof the dname and such, but all that does is print the size of the pointer.. and I tried placing the files into an array, but doing sizeof only prints the size of the array. I want it to print the sizeof the actual file as if I was including them in the header file like the one i posted..p  pIs this possible at all Im so confused and I need to get this to work, but I need help.p  pPlease help.p  pEDIT p  pSo Ive done this with dirent.hp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltdirent.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltfstreamgt  using namespace std  int main int argc, char argv[]  char FileArr[20][256] DIR dir FILE fp int i  0 int k struct dirent ent  dir  opendir argv[1] if dir  NULL      while ent  readdir  dir    NULL          strcpy FileArr[i], entgtdname          fp  fopen FileArr[i], rw          cout ltlt FileArr[i] ltlt ,  ltlt sizeofFileArr[i] ltlt endl         fclosefp         i          closedir dir   return 0  codepre  pAnd this opened up the directory from the command line, and it placed the contents into entdname, and I copied those strings into an array and tried to find the size of all the contents in the array.

Negative 76 pIm writing a C program that parses input from STDIN into words, generates a number of sort processes specified by the numsorts variable, pipes the words in a roundrobin fashion to each of the sort processes, and sends the output of the sorts to STDOUT. p  pMy program works as desired and exits cleanly if the number of specified sort processes is 1, but the sort child processes dont die if the number of sort processes is greater than 1, and my program gets stuck waiting for them. The strangest part of this, to me, is that if I open up a separate terminal window and kill all of the children except 1, the last child immediately dies on its own and the program exits cleanly.p  pHeres my code for the parser the pipe file descriptors are stored in a 2dimensional arrayp  precodevoid RRParserint numsorts, int outPipe Round Robin parser     int i     char word[MAXWORDLEN]      Close read end of pipes     fori  0 i lt numsorts i         closePipeoutPipe[i][0]           fdopen all output pipes     FILE outputs[numsorts]     fori0 i lt numsorts i         outputs[i]  fdopenoutPipe[i][1], w         ifoutputs[i]  NULL             printfError could not create output stream.n           Distribute words to them     i  0     whilescanf[,]c,, word  EOF         strtoupperword         fputsword, outputs[i  numsorts] round robin         fputsn, outputs[i  numsorts] sort needs newline         i           Flush the streams     fori0 i lt numsorts i         iffcloseoutputs[i]  EOF             printfError closing stream.n       codepre  pHeres the code that generates the sort processes PukeAndExit just prints out the error message and exitsp  precodeint spawnSortsint numsorts, int inPipe     returns an array containing all the PIDs of the child processes     Spawn all the sort processes     pidt pid     int i      int processArray  int mallocsizeofint  numsorts     fori  0 i lt numsorts i          switchpid  fork             case 1 oops case                     PukeAndExitForking errorn             case 0 child case                 Bind stdin to read end of pipe                 closePipeinPipe[i][1] close write end of input pipe                 ifinPipe[i][0]  STDINFILENO Defensive check                     ifdup2inPipe[i][0], STDINFILENO  1                         PukeAndExitdup2 0                     closePipeinPipe[i][0] Close duplicate pipe                                  execlpsort, sort, char NULL                break             default parent case                 processArray[i]  pid                   return processArray  codepre  pAt the end of main, heres the code that waits for the sort processes to diep  precodefori0 iltnumsorts i wait for child processes to die.      waitNULL  codepre

Negative 76 pHi this is my first question so be gentle.p  pMy name is Darren Reay and relatively new to frontend development. Im currently creating a portfolio site to send out to potential employers. I want to show them that I am passionate about using clean code that is as semantic as possible. This has lead me to emailing potential employers for advice regarding whats important when doing a portfolio site. After receiving a few replies I realised I needed a coming soon page. This has led me to creating a coming soon page which shows the progress of the portfolio site which in turn shows how I work and how I handle a web project. p  pAs I will be citing all the information Ive received I want to add the information in list form but not quite sure how to correctly go about it.

My lib project was added as a reference into the app project using Framework and ReferencesAdd New Reference.li liI tried to build the application and got linker errors  this is OK, because I forgot to add libxml2.lib to my application via LinkerInputAdditional Dependencies.

Negative 76 pstrongSo this question is delving into security and encryption and the problem potentially hasnt been encountered by many. Answers may be theoretical. Let me outline the scenario...strongp  ol liA website frontend is driven via a backend API. The backend has an endpoint handling a generic registration form with codeusernamecode and codepasswordcode. Its using SSL.li liThe backend API handles registration via an async job queue. The queue emdoes notem return responses to the API server. Its a set and forget operation to queue up the registration.li liQueued jobs are picked up by workers. The workers take care of creating the user account. These workers need access to the plaintext user password so that they can trigger a thirdparty API registration call with the password. li ol  pstrongSo the real crux of the problem is the syncing of the password to the third party API while not revealing it to prying eyes. The queue poses the problem of not having direct access to the plaintext password from global POST data anymore, meaning it needs to be stored in some fashion in the queue.strong p  pThe queue can easily store the hashed password and copy it directly to the users table. This solution does not allow for syncing of the password with the third party API, however, as its already encrypted. I toyed with twoway encryption, but am wholeheartedly concerned with leaving the password prone to decryption by an attacker. p  pstrongCan anybody think of a secure way to handle this scenario of password syncingstrong p  pThe queue is a requirement and its assumed that this is readable by anyone with access to the server. The passwords dont necessarily have to be synced the password for the thirdparty API could be a derivation of the original so long as theres a secure means to decrypt via the logged in user without supplying their password. This is essentially to simulate Single SignOn with a third party API that does not support SSO.p

Negative 76 pIm starting to learn UML and have a question about Actor Generalizationp  pImagine Im writing a use case diagram for some kind of application for a College . Ive identified there are two Actors Student and Teacher.p  pNow, to keep it short, lets say the requirements are fairly simple and not really important to my questionp  ul liA student can search for a classli liA student can register for a classli liA student can submit a paperli liA student can pay his course feesli liA Teacher can grade a paperli liA student can contact a teacher for one of his classes email type message, but all managed within the systemli liA teacher can contact all students for one of his classes again all handled by the system.li ul  pAll jolly good.p  pWhere I get stuck is thisp  ul liA Student has a username and password and must login to use the systemli liA Teacher has a username and password and must login to use the systemli liA Student can reset his password via an online portalli liA Teacher can reset his password via on online portalli ul  pSo my question is this.. How best to handle the common use cases for the systemp  pOn one hand, I could see that both Student and Teacher are a specialized type of User, and the User actor is associated with the common use cases so A User has a username and password and must login, A user can reset his password via an online portal etc.p  pOn the other hand it seems kind of strange to have Teacher and Student have the same superactor correct term as they seem to be two very different users of the system. Should I not therefore keep with the two actors Student and Teacher, and simply make associations between Student to common use cases and Teacher to common use casesp  pIve tried both approaches. As I mentioned, the User generalization approach feels off due to the Teacher and Student being very different, but having several of the same use cases for different actors seems a little unoptimized or redundant, or just funny looking on paper.p  pIs there a right or wrong answer on this or is it just down to preferencep  pThanks in advancedp

I can paste the following code in the console once the page has been created, and all works fine.p  pHow can I force jquery to rescan the DOM so that it registers all of these dynamically created elements Or is there another technique to avoid this problemp  precodedocument.readyfunction       .prevButton.clickfunction       var r  this.attrtabGroup     var e  .navtabs[tabGroup  r  ] li.active.prev.finda[datatoggletab]     if e.length gt 0          e.click          return false prevent the page from jumping around   .nextButton.clickfunction       var r  this.attrtabGroup     var f  .navtabs[tabGroup  r  ] li.active.next.finda[datatoggletab]     if f.length gt 0          f.click          return false prevent the page from jumping around   codepre  pMany thanks for any tipsp
Negative 76 pIn Google Chrome, when viewing the developer tools, in the bottom right there is a Gear Icon that opens an additional Settings popup. One of the pages in the Settings popup is Overrides that contains User Agent and Device Metrics settings. I am trying to find the extensions API that is able to set those values programatically. Does such an API exist p  pIve looked the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.chrome.comextensionsapiindex.html relnofollowmain apisa, and the a hrefhttpdeveloper.chrome.comtrunkextensionsexperimental.html relnofollowexperimental apisa , but cant seem to find anything.p  pThe sample for devtools.panels in the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.chrome.comextensionssamples.html relnofollowcode samplesa doesnt seem to indicate how to explore the existing devpanels either.p  pSpecifically Im trying to build simple extension available from a context menu in a Browser Action.

Negative 76 pIve autoloaded a class, which is properly namespaced and PSR0. I put it in applibCI, and the class and its filename are the same DB.

Negative 76 pI just start learning hash table and while trying with stdmap I come up with this question when using separate chaining method to solve collision, can I use codestd priorityqueuecode instead of just list p  pFor example there is a big group of people and I have the information of their first names and ages, and what I want to get is sorted lists of people with same first name e.g. David base on their ages.p  pSo to do this I first use their first name as the key to put these people into the map, and then people with same name that cause the collision should be solved with stdpriorityqueue base on age. p  pIs this the right way to solve this problem  And I just realize that I dont really know the mystery behind codestdmapcode, is it using separate chaining or linear probing to solve collision I couldnt find the answer for that.p  pSimple code I have for the question I described that might help clarify it a bitp  precodeclass people   public peoplestring inName, int inAgefirstNameinName, ageinAge private  string firstName int age     int mainint argc, char  argv   string name int age  name  David age  25 people  aPersonname, age This is just an example, there are usually more than two attributes to deal with.   stdmap ltstring, peoplegt peopleList  peopleList[name]  aPerson  now how do I implement the priority queue for collision first names   codepre  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT since I need O1 search, I should use unordered map instead of map.p

Negative 76 pTDD best practices say that a fresh test should fail.

Refactor  test still passes.p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodebool ValidateCondition condition      return condition.EndDate gt condition.StartDate  codepre  pAfter step 3 I see that had I not refactored the condition, I could add a new test, which checks that method returns true if start date comes before end date. However, if I do the refactoring first, writing such test would just mean that it passes immediately. To me it looks like the test might make the code more robust.p  pWhy would writing such test would be a bad ideawouldnt be a good idea according to the TDDp  pEdit I am thinking now, perhaps writing codereturn truecode by default in the implementation might not be a good idea and I should throw a codeNotImplementedExceptioncode.

Negative 76 pThe application Im building is a Webapplication that gives the user the possibility to enter new contracts for the upcoming weeks. We use a webservice which returns a JSON file to my ASP.net. Because of the complexity of the component we are trying to build, we pass the JSON to jquery to build the layout. In ASP.net  MVC 4, we are planning to store a session with the JSON file. When the user is editing or adding new values we check if the value has changed in Jquery. p  pIf this value is changed we would like to make a call to ASP to update the session with the JSON. How should we approach this In our controller make an action like ExampleupdateSession In Ajax I guess this will be a POST method Right. But with I post Im afraid I will have to do a page refresh and I really do not want this.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThanks in advance.p  h2Edit  Exampleh2  pcurrently Im on the action controlleraction  contractsindex, what will the ajaxcall be then Post to contractsupdateJson What will the return value be of that actionmethod content  view  ...  p

Negative 76 pwere building a RESTAPI using Spring MVC 3.2, Jackson 1.9.12, Hibernate 4.2.2.p  pYesterday I needed to pass a small object graph to the API, which should get persisted in the database. It some kind of works and I emcouldem build workarounds for those problems, but I think there must be a nicer solution.p  pSo here is what we havep  ul liClass codeBillcodeli liClass codeContactcodeli liClass codeAddresscodeli liClass codeItemcodeli ul  pRelations arep  ul licodeBillcode has emtwoem codeOneToOnecode relations to codeContactcode. One called codesendercode, one called codereceivercode.li licodeBillcode has a codeManyToOnecode relation to codeItemcode, called codeitemcode.li licodeContactcode has a codeOneToOnecode relation to codeAddresscode, called codeaddresscode.li ul  pThis emmayem seem a bit dumb, but I left out some fields and other relations, to bring the problem to the pointp  h2First Problem  Simple case  Overriding database entriesh2  pLets ignore all those dependencies and relations and just take the plain codeBillcode class. If theres an incoming JSON request which doesnt contain an object id everything works as expected and SpringHibernate creates a emnewem entry in databasep  precode ...   createdAt20130529  codepre  pBut if I specify an id in the JSON request, SpringHibernate will update the row containing the given idp  precode ...   idc5a562d0c8ab1c428399080012345678   createdAt20130529  codepre  pIf I specify an id in the JSON request, but that id doesnt exist in database, it will create a new entry.p  pThe code I use is nothing special. Heres the controller actionp  precodeRequestMappingvalue  create, method  RequestMethod.POST ResponseStatusvalue  HttpStatus.CREATED public Bill createRequestBody Bill bill      bill  service.createBillbill     return bill  codepre  pAnd the service methodp  precodePreAuthorizeisAuthenticated Transactional public Bill createBillBill bill      bill  billDao.storebill     return bill  codepre  pAs you can see, Id like to use the codecreatecode path to strongcreatestrong new entries and not update already existing ones. As a workaround I emcouldem of course use codesetIdnullcode in the first line of the controller action, but strongis there any nicerbetter waystrongp  h2Second Problem  Another id thing  How to correctly design entitiesh2  pWe again have the object graph from abovep  precodebill ...   sender ...     address ...    ,   receiver ...     address ...    ,   item ...   codepre  pTheres a logical difference between codeContactcodeand codeAddresscode and codeItemcodep  ul liA codeContactcode and codeAddresscode consists of a bunch of emnewem data. Means The GUI will display a lot input fields, which the user has to fill in.li liAn codeItemcode emis alreadyem in the database, and I basically would just need its codeidcode, not the whole object. This means The GUI will display a dropdown list with all existing codeItemcodes and the user has to choose one of them.li ul  pNow of course Id like to use and reuse my entities, but my codeBillcode entity for example expects an codeItemcode object, not an codeitemidcode. As a workaround I could of course create another bean, which is nearly the same as the codeBillcode class, but instead of codeitemcode it contains an codeitemidcodep  precodethenewspecialbillforincomingjson ...   sender ...     address ...    ,   receiver ...     address ...    ,   itemid ...   codepre  pSo again, the same question strongIs there a nicerbetter waystrongp  pThank you guysp

Negative 76 pWell, thanks to a user user on this site, I was able to log some data from a JavaScript function into an html table. Now I have another question to ask. How can I run the function multiple times while the page is loading and log the output from that one function into the same html table Because my code as of now only runs and logs the output of the function once, and when I refresh the page I lose the numbers which were previously generated. I want to be able to run the function say 10 times and display that on the html table. Your help would be greatly appreciated.p  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltscript typetextjavascript languagejavascriptgt             R  10             theta  Math.random  2  Math.PI             r1  Math.random  R             r2  R  Math.random  100             ray  r1  Math.random  r2  r1             point  [rayMath.costheta, rayMath.sintheta]               var distance  functionx1, y1, rad, x2, y2                  return Math.sqrtMath.powy2  y1, 2  Math.powx2  x1, 2  rad                       ltscriptgt      ltdivgt             lttable border1gt                 ltthgtX Centerltthgt                 ltthgtY Centerltthgt                 ltthgtr1ltthgt                 ltthgtr2ltthgt                 ltthgtX Randomltthgt                 ltthgtY Randomltthgt                 ltthgtDistanceltthgt                 lttrgt                     lttdgtltinput typetext idx centergtlttdgt                     lttdgtltinput typetext idy centergtlttdgt                     lttdgtltinput typetext idr1gtlttdgt                     lttdgtltinput typetext idr2gtlttdgt                     lttdgtltinput typetext idx randomgtlttdgt                     lttdgtltinput typetext idy randomgtlttdgt                     lttdgtltinput typetext iddisplacementgtlttdgt                 lttrgt              lttablegt         ltscriptgt             document.getElementByIdx center.value  0             document.getElementByIdy center.value  0             document.getElementByIdr1.value  r1             document.getElementByIdr2.value  r2             document.getElementByIdx random.value  point[0]             document.getElementByIdy random.value  point[1]             document.getElementByIddisplacement.value  distance0,0,R,point[0], point[1]         ltscriptgt     ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 76 pI am in need of grabbing some stats from a 88k rows table.p  pThe rows are each representing a reference number, which are connected to a order in the system. One order can have multiple reference numbers.p  pNow I would like to archieve to find out some totales, how many claimed reference numbers are there, and how many cancelled reference numbers are there  and group and list the totales per Deal.p  pThis is what I have done OBS. Kohana Query Builder are used for the queries, but I think you can figure out what the real MySQL query look like. And you can answer in pure MySQL queryp  precode    refs  DBselectrefnumbers.cancelled, refnumbers.isclaimed, deals.price, deals.ID, refnumbers.orderid     gtfromrefnumbers     gtjoindealsgtondeals.ID, , refnumbers.dealid     gtexecute     gtasarray      totalcancelled  array     totalclaimed  array      foreachrefs as ref              isProduct  DBselectproductidgtfromorderschosenoptionsgtwhereorderid, , ref[orderid]gtexecutegtgetproductid, 0          ifisProduct gt 0                      price  DBselectpricegtfromdealsproductsgtwhereid, , isProduct             gtexecutegtgetprice, ref[price]          else             price  ref[price]                   ifref[cancelled]  1                      totalcancelled[ref[ID]]  price         else ifref[isclaimed]  1                      totalclaimed[ref[ID]]  price               codepre  pI believe that all this code can maybe be replaced by a query Maybe with some SUMdeals.price if cancelled  1 i dont know how to do this in pure mysql and the same to isclaimed.p  pThere is just one more problem which is that we can not trust the deals.price if the deal that the user have bought is a product deal and theres different prices inside the deal  then we need to grab the price from dealsproducts as you can see.p  pIs it possible to do it all in one query If not, how can this php code be optimizedp  pSince this code will take forever and probably time out even with a high timeout setting with these 88k rows, I seek for a solution like this.p  pThanksp

Negative 76 pEach data structure has its own time complexities.  The biggest one that jumps out at you is the hash table.  The average times for Insertion, Deletion and Searching are all O1.  But its really just constant time, since there can be multiple reps through each of these to find the right spot.  The real question is, can we do each of those operations in exactly one operation, if space wasnt an issuep  pRecently I was working on the radix sort, and figuring out how to speed it up as much as possible.  The one thing I settled on was doing a 2byte counting sort, thus you would only have to loop once through.  Then I got to thinking about the trie I used before, with integers where I traversed through by modding the number by 10 each time through.  This seemed to be faster than any other data structure that Ive tried, but wanted to make it faster.  What I tried today was treating the trie as a guaranteed 2level tree.  Each node with 216 65536 children.  That way I can reference each number like this rootlink[twoByte1]link[twoByte2].  Where twoByte1 is the first 16 bits, and 2 is he 2nd.  Problem is, this is a lot of memory.  Instead I decided to make an array of structures, with 216 bool uint8t values instead, and ran across the same issue.  To fix this, I made the following structure.p  precodestruct trie      unsigned int link[2048]  codepre  pI decided to use 2048 unsigned integers or signed, wasnt sure if there would be a difference instead.  That way I can treat each bit as the truefalse value during look up.  In order to reference each position, I would take the first 16 bytes, and reference the element he same way as before, but the 2nd I would divide by 32 to find out which element of the integer array to use, and mod the number again by 32 to find out which bit to look at.  The following is the code I used to reference itp  precodeuint8t getData int data, uint16tamp dir, uint16tamp pos, uint8tamp x      dir  data gtgt 0  amp 0xffff     pos  data gtgt 16 amp 0xffff     x     pos  32     return pos  32  codepre  pThe insert function was simply finding the spot and turning the bit on.  To do this, I would get the data from the function above, then OR the specific bit with 1.  Similarly with deletion, only I would invert the bit string, then AND it, to turn it off.  Then to search for that element, I would just return the specific bit.  Help with how to clear the bit was found here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions47981howdoyousetclearandtoggleasinglebitincHow do you set, clear and toggle a single bit in Ca   Below is the code for those three functions.p  precodevoid inserttrie root, int data      uint16t dir, pos     uint8t x, y  getDatadata, dir, pos, x     root[dir].link[x]  1 ltlt y  bool findtrie root, int data      uint16t dir, pos     uint8t x, y  getDatadata, dir, pos, x     return root[dir].link[x] amp 1 ltlt y  void removetrie root, int data      uint16t dir, pos     uint8t x, y  getDatadata, dir, pos, x     root[dir].link[x] amp 1 ltlt y  codepre  pFrom here it was as simple as initializing the array of structs.  The great thing is that with the number of elements coming in, the data structure will never grow any farther out.  Also, in the case of threading, since Im only turning the bits on during insertion, I dont think I would need to synchronize any of the threads.  Therefor it could be speed up with threading.  What are your thoughts on this, I did a test case here a hrefhttpideone.comMcwWTV relnofollowhttpideone.comMcwWTVa .  I ran a test on a Linux machine running on an i7, and was able to process 250 million integers per every 2.5 seconds.p

Negative 76 pThis a topic on Haskell discussed a lot e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5773070howaremutablearraysimplementedinhaskellmutablearrayimplementationa, but I am still not sure what is the best practice for the case requiring frequent modification and randomaccess of an arrayvector. p  pSay a vector of length 1,000,000. Operation on it involves accessing a small, e.g 1000 subset of it based on input, and modifying the values based on the input. Furthermore, such operation are repeated 2,000,000 times. The task itself can be implemented in pure data structure such as list as the following for example, though very inefficientp  precodetype Vect  [Int]  f  Vect gt [[Int]] gt Vect f x indsList  foldl g x indsList   g is just an example of randomaccess and modifications on the values. g  Vect gt [Int] gt Vect g x inds  map h  zip x [0..]     where h x, i  if i elem inds then x  i  1 else x  i codepre  pHashMap data structure e.g. IntMap could be used for efficient large amounts of randomaccesses, but arrayvector should do it too. More importantly, the large amount of modifications is still need to be addressed by a mutable structure to avoid memory replication. Is there a mutable, randomacesss arrayvector in Haskell indeed If STIO Monads used, does such controls affect performance in my settings p

Negative 76 pWhen I am in the .net world and using MVC a common pattern used when wanting to do cross cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, transaction management etc I would use DI paired with AOP to basically put attributes on my methods which required proxyingweaving.p  pSo it may look likep  precodepublic class SomeController     [Authenticate]    public ActionResult SomeAuthenticatedAction      public ActionResult NotAuthenticatedAction   codepre  pSo given the above when SomeAuthenticatedAction was called it would check the request for an authorization cookie do some logic around that and either bomb the user out with a 401 or something. It would know to do this because it has an attribute on it that at runtime it knows to hook into and proxy.p  pNow I am in javascript land and am looking at getting the same sort of functionality but doing it the best way for that platform. So I am wondering how I should go about doing this in nodejs, as there is no sort of attribute paradigm in javascript so without either ingraining the authentication into each codeapp. get,post etccode call which I dont like, or at the application entry point proxy each action I know needs to be authenticated, which is not ideal either.p  pSo is there a way for me to indicate that a method emshouldem have some cross cutting concern applied to it, without actually putting the logic in there So that way the web code doesnt know about the authentication mechanism, and the app entry point doesnt know about the specific method, it just knows it wants all methods which have some metadata with themp  pI hope this makes sense, as if you dont use AOP much you probably will think im talking in riddles, but doing this this way makes my code a lot easier to test and maintain and also allows me to reconfigure applications very quickly.p  pSo far I have found a hrefhttpsgithub.comcowboyjavascripthooker relnofollowHookera, which can do the proxying part of the puzzle although not quite sure how I would get the underlying request object in it, but I wouldnt see the proxying of an object in JS being too much of a pain, but I just need to find a way to identify the methods to intercept... any info would be great.p  p Edit p  pAfter reading up a bit more it may look like what I emshouldem be doing is using middleware layers to do what I need, as this would at least allow simpler code and the intentions of routes would be clearer. Will keep looking at come back once I find out more or a better answer appears.p

Negative 76 pI thought the proper way to sanitize incoming data from an HTML form embeforeem entering it into a mySQL database was to use coderealescapestringcode on it in the PHP script, like this p  precodenewsStoryHeadline  POST[newsStoryHeadline] newsStoryHeadline  mysqligtrealescapestringnewsStoryHeadline storyDate  POST[storyDate] storyDate  mysqligtrealescapestringstoryDate storySource  POST[storySource] storySource  mysqligtrealescapestringstorySource  etc. codepre  pAnd once thats done you could just insert the data to the DB like thisp  precodemysqligtqueryINSERT INTO NewsStoriesTable Headline, Date, DateAdded, Source, StoryCopy VALUES .newsStoryHeadline., .storyDate., .dateAdded., .storySource., .storyText. codepre  pSo I thought doing this would take care of cleaning up all the invisible junk characters that may be coming in with your submitted text.p  pHowever, I just pasted some text I copied from a webpage into my HTML form, clicked submit  which ran the above script and inserted that text into my DB  but when I read that text embackem from the DB, I discovered that this piece of text emdidem still have junk characters in it, such as codecode. br And those junk characters of course caused the PHP script I wrote that emretrievesem the information from the DB to crash.p  pSo what am I doing wrongp  pIs using coderealescapestringcode emnotem the way to go here  Or should I be using it in conjunction with something else OR, is there something I should be doing like more escaping when reading reading data back out from the the mySQL databasep  pI should mention that Im an ObjectiveC developer, not a PHPmySQL developer, but Ive unfortunately been given this task to do some DB stuff  hence my question...  thanksp

Negative 76 pI Wrote a simple recurrent neural network 7 neurons, each one is initially connected to all the neurons and trained it using a genetic algorithm to learn complicated, nonlinear functions like 11x2. As the training set, I used 20 values within the range [5,5] I tried to use more than 20 but the results were not changed dramatically.p  pThe network can learn this range pretty well, and when given examples of other points within this range, it can predict the value of the function. However, it can not extrapolate correctly and predicting the values of the function outside the range [5,5]. What are the reasons for that and what can I do to improve its extrapolation  abilitiesp  pThanksp

Negative 76 pId like to know why derby does not take into account property currentSchema defined on a given datasource WAS for current example p  pMy problem is quite the same that Nastya have in this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15735068omitschemainthederbyqueryOmit schema in the DERBY Querya But there is no answer to hisher last comment.p  pSo, i have an application working on different datasources same database but one schema per datasource.  I thought that Derby would use the property currentSchema defined on a datasource if i tell him to use this datasource, but all my named queries are executed on schema DEV database user nameinstead of the schema defined in my datasource property currentSchema. I know thats derby default behaviour when no schema is provided with the query and if no SET CURRENT SCHEMA statement executed before, but...p  blockquote   pIs there any existing solution or coming improvement into Derby to solve this use case    i do not consider this as an issue as Derby has been designed to use a schema per user i thinkp blockquote  pThanks in advance for any suggestion.p  pstrongPSstrong To understand why i need this i have written scripts to automatically configure derby datasources into developers workstation local websphere so that they can deploy  run their applications onto a local database instead of a common DB2 developement one. But i would avoid doing a SET CURRENT SCHEMA statement before every request in the application code just to solve this issue... performance impact on the other real environments And of course i cannot change local database to use something else than Derby p

Negative 76 pWorking on a multithreaded crossplatform python3.3 application I came across some weird behavior I was not expecting and am not sure is expected. The issue is on Windows 8 calling the codeinputcode method in one thread blocks other threads until it completes.

Negative 76 pIm currently in a deep learning process for a school project. After a month I perfectly understood the concept of css3 and html, including, but very limited, some basic javascript. I have read alot of tutorials and have found a new one which includes a demo which is truly fascinating to me. It uses a drop down menu list to trigger the page transition effects. Studying the code it starts to make sense to me. However, im starting to wonder how to to apply seperate individual buttons instead of creating list items as a trigger.p  pI have no clue where to start or which part of the code has to be changed. I would be happy for some feedback.p  pThe Demo a hrefhttptympanus.netDevelopmentPageTransitions relnofollowhttptympanus.netDevelopmentPageTransitionsap

I need to calculate the length of the line or the distance between the two points. I use the formula Math.sqrtx2x1emx2x1y2y1emy2y1 to calculate distance between two points and get a value like 250.82 or so. The resultant values is in pixels. How can I convert them to metric values or in the units of mm and cm  I find many pixel to cm calculators online but they give me wrong answer which doesnt match with the real distance between two points.

Negative 76 pThis is part of a series of questions about implementing a qualitative data type in Fortran.p  pstrongBackgroundstrong The topic relates to something called emloop analysis of complex systemsem which one might read about in, for example, Puccia, C. J. and Levins, R. 1986. emQualitative Modeling of Complex Systems An Introduction to Loop Analysis and Time Averagingem. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, or Levins, R. 1974. The qualitative analysis of partially specified systems. emAnnals of the New York Academy of Sciencesem, 231123138. While I could implement this technique using numerical matrix algebra as has been done elsewhere, I am interested in approaching the problem from a different direction. The nature of loop analysis is complex and costly I am not a CS person, but I think its something like a P difficulty calculation, and my long term aims are to create a set of libraries for various and sundry loop analysis problems that employ pruning optimizations based on properties of qualitative arithmetic. If this seems hopelessly misguided, please humor me and consider this an exercise in learning.p  pFor my purposes the QUALIT data type can have 4 values 1, 0, 1, and  sometimes represented as , 0, , and .

Take the following model as an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comF46Et.png altenter image description herep  pHere, I want to give the user the ability to delete codeemployeecodes maybe because theyve left the company, etc.. However, these employees are listed on projects. To change the codecreatoremployeeidcode on projects would make the data obviously incorrect, and to cascade delete the projects where that employee is listed is clearly a nono.p  pSo, Ive handled this in the past by adding a flagp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCKXt1.png altenter image description herep  pSo, when a user goes to delete an employee, I check if deleting that employee violates any foreign key constraints. If it doesnt, I delete the employee. If it does, I set the employee to active  0.p  pHowever, this entire process of checking, iffing, deleting or deactivating is really complicated and cumbersome to compensate for on the codelevel. Because an employee might not just be tied to projects, but to other entities as well, you have to write a check for each entity, determine if it makes sense to delete or deactivate, etc. Then you have to give the user a way to viewreactivate inactive records.p  pMy question is Are there any other approaches to handling this specific kind of problem Ive tried looking around the web, but this problem is difficult to find the wording for. Perhaps even just the right strongwordsstrong will help point me in the right direction. I hope this problem makes sense.p

Negative 76 pIm using Breeze in a single page application saving to an asp.net web api server. My app is using forms authentication and my Breeze controller is decorated with the Authorize attributep  precode[System.Web.Http.Authorize] [BreezeController] public class ReminderController  ApiController  ...  codepre  pIm seeing an issue where as soon as Breeze attempts to save, and embeforeem the request completes, the browser instantly pops up a usernamepassword authentication dialog. Im not entirely sure why this happens as the aspx cookie is not set to expire but I can replicate it by logging in to my app, deleting the cookie and then triggering a Breeze save. If I click cancel on the dialog, my server responds with a 401 which my client code handles. I want to ensure the auth dialog is never shown to the user. This happens in Chrome and IE currently but Im sure it didnt do this in older releases of Chrome stable.p  pThe request can be seen here, still listed as Pending while the dialog is displayedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAK6TJ.png altRequestp  pThanks p

Negative 76 pI have the following predicamentp  pa I have a designer who designs in photoshop and always uses 72dpi b I have developers who get his images and need them to be crisp and sharp for multiple android devices largersmaller in size, different dpis c I dont want to confuse the designer with points, dps, etc. I want him to continue using what he knows 72dpi canvas, all sizes to be specified in pixels p  pIve read many,many,many threads and links and tutorials and am confused.p  pHere is what I plan to do  a I plan to ask him to design screens using a 720px  1280px screen. This is the resolution of a Samsung S3p  pb I plan to ask him to specify all sizes of items inside reference screen, as well as their distance from phone boundaries in pixels too I dont want to confuse him p  pc What the developers plan to then do, is take his assets and his reference screens, look at the sizes, and convert to dps in the android layout by basically adding applicable multipliersp  pd What the designer also needs to do is resize images in his reference screen for ldpi, mdpi, xhdpi and xxhdpi, which my developers will move to the correct folders so they are picked up at runtime by Android depending on which devices they are testing onp  pe NOTE We plan to have the same layout for all sizes of phones  no different layouts, so assume that the design this person is creating will show well on all sizes p  pQuestions 1 The designer needs to know with this set up 72dpi PS screen,720x1280, when he is asked to resize images for different dpi buckets, what should he consider his reference screen as MDPI or XHDPI as he will have to scale his images accordingly when generating them for the developerp  p2 I want to keep this simple for him. I dont want him to get confused on dpis. So I plan to tell him that forget about dpis when creating your photoshop reference screens  just design for a 720x1280 screen  the usual 72dpi. Our developers will convert all distances to dps on their side. Any issues with thisp  p3 I also need to tell my developers how to convert his pixel distances to dps, so I need to tell him what they should treat this 720x1280 72dpi screen as. Is it MDPI or XHDPIp  pThanksp

Negative 76 pI have been searching high and low for anyone who might know why the following is happening and had no luck. I am really hoping someone here understands what is going on and can help because I am so lost.p  pHere is what is going on, we have multiple 2 directories for each developer on this project, a private and a public. I ran into a problem where I was on my private folder, well call it source and I did a git checkout b branchnamehere worked on everything I needed to work on, then did a commit and a push... git push origin branchnamehere so it is now on the main repo. I then went into my public folder, well call it pubsource and tried to pull it... git checkout branchnamehere but that popped an error saying stuff about not having tracking history and all that, so in a frenzy I just went into a terminal window and did this...p  precoderm rf pubsource cp R source pubsource codepre  pand that worked, now my pubsource had the correct files in it and I could show everyone things are working. Now the problem comes in, I go back into my source folder and do git checkout master, thinking everything was cool, it wasnt what happened was both source and pubsource changed to masterp  pSo i am super confused and now I cant change my source branch without ruining my pub directory. Ill run through the commands down here so you can see exactly what happened..p  precodessh ltltSERVER NAMEgtgt cd source that takes me to my working directory and git repo git checkout b ltltBRANCH NAMEgtgt Work on files and get things fixed git add A There were a lot of files and this is easier git commit m blah blah git push origin ltltBRANCH NAMEgtgt cd .. takes me back to my home dir rm rf pubsource Delete the pub directory cp R source pubsource now pub source has all the new files and is on the right branch cd source  back into working dir git checkout master codepre  pafter that git checkout master line, both source, and pubsource switch to master. Now anytime I do anything in source dealing with branches, i.e. git checkout ANOTHER BRANCH both source and pubsource change to the ANOTHER BRANCH. I really hope I am explaining this correctly, and I really really hope that someone can see what is going on and how I can get my source folder to be able to change branches without also changing my pubsource. Thank you in advance for any help you might have.p  pOn a side note I know that if I had done git checkout b lt origin I wouldve had tracking info and could have then done a pull in pub, but I didnt and now Im stuck. Please help. Thank youp

Then using the sample at a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetMultiAutoCompleteTextView.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetMultiAutoCompleteTextView.htmla I will bound my MultiAutoCompleteTextView to the adapter. At this point, I am not sure how to convert the adapter to match my needs i.e. search contacts by name or phone and to retrieve the numbers. So my call for help is this has anyone successfully done this and dont mind sharing their code Or Does anyone know how I can modify the linked adapter to give me phone numbers, which I can search by name or phone And third, will the adapter work with MultiAutoCompleteTextViewp  pstrongNotestrongp  pIn asking this question, I have made certain assumptions on how Google is implementing their MultiAutoCompleteTextView for emails.

But I am trying to convert the implementation to MultiAutoCompleteTextView but its not allowing for multiple entries.

I simply replaced codeAutoCompleteTextViewcode with codeMultiAutoCompleteTextViewcode, and I ignored the other answers codeonItemClickcode suggestion. Its working, kind of. Except, the data I get is not the nice formatted elements that you see in the gmail codeEditTextcode. So back to the original question how is Google doing it I dont want to spend time explaining how the gmail compose editText looks as the relevant reader can readily verify this. In their codeEditTextcode I can enter four contacts and then with random access click on one to delete it. I want to be able to do that. Howp

Negative 76 pI have just upgraded from MVC 4 to 5 and started using attribute routing. It works perfect and is easy to implement.p  pBut since the website has been up for a few months theres a number of links to the website, including from search engines. The old urls will not work so I need to redirect them permanently. Im not sure what the best way would be. I thought that if I created a route in the route.config, this would work as a backup for the routing attribute. But it seems to be only one that works first served.p  pExample..  Old url bank5 New url superbank5p  pThe attribute route looks like this p  precode[Routesuperbankid] codepre  pAnd the route.configp  precoderoutes.IgnoreRouteresource.axdpathInfo routes.LowercaseUrls  true  routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes  routes.MapRoute             BankDetails,             bankid,             new  controller  Home, action  bank , the action is still called bank, not superbank             new  id  d    codepre  pWith this code, only superbank5 will work, not bank5 If I put MapMvcAttributeRoutes beneath the MapRoute, neither of the urls will work and all urls in the project will be created and pointing to bank5.p  pAny ideas Should I use global.asax or IIS url rewritep

Negative 76 pIf I wanted to turn one of my old computers into a game server for my friends and I to play games together over just my friends and I, this wouldnt be some sort of server for everyone everywhere playing online games to use.

We have set up a system where, for each class that is copied across, we define an interface and then a class that implements the interface.p  pThis works great because the JSON that is copied across can be cast to the interface and then the properties can be assigned.

Ive already imported a gauge visualization, which looks at Spotfires API to get the data values, then writes them to an HTMLJavascript file including D3, and then loads the file in the embedded browser, which causes the gauge to move.p  pThe issue comes here In the scatterplot matrix in D3, you can make a box around the points and select them. I would like to reflect these changes in Spotfire, by looking at the slected values and then setting them as marked using Spotfires C API.p  pIs this possible Im finding it difficult to visualize how Javascript could change Cs content. The only way I can imagine would be if I invoked a function every X amount of time that parsed through the Javascript to check for any highlighted values by calling a setInterval which returned the selected values in D3 every X amount of time.p

Negative 76 pI apologize in advance if any part of my question seems really stupid. I am an undergraduate student. I dont have any experience in website development but the research I am doing this summer involves a lot of it so I have taught myself some stuff. p  pI have built a web application that functions like a survey. A person starts taking the survey, their ID is stored in the database and their responses are recorded an analyzed. The application that I built on my local computer is fully functional and now I am trying to get it online so it can be accessed by the public. So far I have created a series of .php files on my local computer and I am using WAMP server and I have a functional database all set up on PhpMyadmin. My web application with the .php files and database works. All files can be run successfully and the database is successfully being accessed and updated. p  pI am trying to get this online for free if possible. I am currently using a free trial of Amazon Web Services which is free for a couple months since the application is a survey it does not need to be online longer than that but it is really confusing me. Amazon Web services howto guides involve writing additional .NET files and creating a whole series of instances of virtual servers in the cloud. I have no idea what Im doing and there must be a simple way to put up a very basic web application written solely in php, javascript, html and CSS with a simple Mysqlite database on the backend. Any ideas I am really strapped for time so any help would be oh so greatly appreciate  p  pThank youp

Negative 76 pFor sake of example, imagine i was building a virtual machine. I have a byte array and a while loop, how do i know how many bytes to read from the byte array for the next instruction to interpret a intel 8086 like instructionp  pEDIT commented the cpu reads the opcode at the instruction pointer, with 8086 and CISC you have one byte and two byte instructions. How do i know if the next instruction is F or FFp  pEDIT Found a ansew myself in this peice of text on a hrefhttpwww.swansontec.comsintel.html relnofollowhttpwww.swansontec.comsintel.htmlap  blockquote   pThe operation code, or opcode, comes after any optional prefixes. The   opcode tells the processor which instruction to execute. In addition,   opcodes contain bit fields describing the size and type of operands to   expect. The NOT instruction, for example, has the opcode 1111011w. In   this opcode, the w bit determines whether the operand is a byte or a   word. The OR instruction has the opcode 000010dw. In this opcode, the   d bit determines which operands are the source and destination, and   the w bit determines the size again. Some instructions have several   different opcodes. For example, when OR is used with the accumulator   register AX or EAX and a constant, it has the special spacesaving   opcode 0000110w, which eliminates the need for a separate ModRM byte.   From a sizecoding perspective, memorizing exact opcode bits is not   necessary. Having a general idea of what type of opcodes are available   for a particular instruction is more important.p blockquote

Negative 76 pWe have a problem in our Windows 8.1 application WinRT that sometimes our saved file gets corrupt. The files have a correct file size, but the file only contains NULcharacters.

Besides that, also the log file gets corrupt also only NULcharacters. The whole file consists of NULcharacters.

Also given the name is valid 200 OK is returned instead of 403 FORBIDDEN making the user believe that he managed to change the salary as well, which was not the case.p  pI found a mailing list a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicdjangorestframeworkP1tuaWaWAIM relnofollowposta with quite a similar problem, though it hasnt been replied to.p

Negative 76 pI have 2 EC2 instances  one master and one worker. Master instance creates a job and pushes it to SQS and the worker thread listens to it.p  pMy issue is, I need the worker to be able to tell the master that the job was completed. I have been researching about it a bit and the only option that I was able to find was to create 2 SQS threads and use one for sending the jobs to the worker and the other one to send the completed status from the worker to the master.p  pIs there any other way I would be OK to use something other than SQS as well...p

Negative 76 pIn my script im deleting file paths in database firstly. If deleting paths is done. Im deleting files.p  pI realized that something wrong in my ftp panel. Some files are orphan. There is no path in database but i have files.p  pYou know that we can use try catch block for commit and roll back database queries. Is there any technique for files. For example well delete paths and we started to delete files. If there exists a problem during deleting files. We have to rollback Files and Paths.p
Negative 76 pIve been having issues with the Google Analytics GA API over the past several weeks. Our application regularly every 2h queries the GA API for visitor numbers from clients of ours.p  pHowever, sometimes the GA API suddenly returns only 0s for page metrics that previously provided data. This doesnt happen for all websites, only for a few, occasionally. The problem always starts around midnight GMT and persists for up to 24 hours. p  pIt definitely isnt a quota error, as we would have caught that. In fact, Googles API doesnt return any error at all, it just returns 0s for all requested metrics.p  pHas anyone experienced this issue before How can I solve this as its bit of a show stopper.p

It throws an exception if I try to simply alter the table to add a pre existing column. Is there an alter table add column if column doesnt exists type query or should I handle it through exception handlingp

I will describe the actions my program needs to take following the tablesp  precodeBookListings table...      userID VARCHAR50 NOT NULL     dateListed timestamp Default CURRENTTIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENTTIMESTAMP     isbn13 VARCHAR20 NOT NULL     price UNSIGNED TINYINT NOT NULL     email VARCHAR30 NOT NULL     phone VARCHAR20 NOT NULL     condition VARCHAR30 NOT NULL     latitude FLOAT9,7 NOT NULL     longitude FLOAT9,7 NOT NULL  ContactInfo table...     email VARCHAR30 NOT NULL    phone VARCHAR20 NOT NULL codepre  pKeep in mind ContactInfo table is not really of much importance. I am going to clear it every so often once I move the information off of the database to free up space. If this table is causing major efficiency problems, I could sacrifice it completely and I wouldnt really be bothered.p  pstrongBannedUsersstrong table...p  ul listronguserIDstrong emVARCHAR50em NOT NULLli listrongbanReasonstrong emVARCHAR50em NOT NULLli ul  pBannedUsers table is where I am going to keep track of bans. It will rarely be used but if for some reason I want to disable someone from using my program I can just put their userID in there. When my program starts, it checks the BannedUsers table to see if user is banned and if so it gives them the ban reason.p  pI am kind of confused where to place indexes I dont know much about them. I just hear that indexes speed up searches immensely. For my BannedUsers I think it is obvious to put index on userID column If so, what kind of indexp  pFor BookListings table it is more confusing to me where to place indexes. First I will explain all of the features of my program actions to be taken along with the query taken from my php scriptp  ol liI use the following query to enter a listing into my system. This is for when a user wants to sell a book, they list the book. So you can imagine this action will be done quite a bit...li ol  pp  precodeINSERT INTO Listings VALUES userID, NOW  INTERVAL 2 HOUR, isbn13, price, email, phone,          condition, latitude, longitude codepre  ol start2 liI use the following query when the user wants to buy search for a book listing within a certain distance from them. Just like the query to list a book, this action will also be used a lotli ol  pp  precodeSELECT     ,        6371  acos        cos  radiansuserLatitude         cos radians latitude          cos radians longitude   radiansuserLongitude         sin  radiansuserLatitude         sin radians latitude         AS distance FROM Listings WHERE isbn13isbn13 HAVING distance lt withinDistance ORDER BY price, dateListed codepre  pThe above query is to order by the price. The following query orders by the date insteadp  pp  precodeSELECT     ,        6371  acos        cos  radiansuserLatitude         cos radians latitude          cos radians longitude   radiansuserLongitude         sin  radiansuserLatitude         sin radians latitude         AS distance FROM Listings WHERE isbn13isbn13 HAVING distance lt withinDistance ORDER BY dateListed DESC codepre  ol start3 liThe following query is done right after listing a book. It is a way to collect user contact informationli ol  pp  precodeINSERT INTO ContactInfo VALUES email, phone codepre  ol start4 liThe following query is used at the beginning of the program to find out how many books are listed in the system just to keep a fun count of how many books the system has dealt with, not really that importantli ol  pp  precodeSELECT COUNT FROM ContactInfo codepre  ol start5 liThe following query is used to find all of the users books that they have listed in the system. It will be done quite often because they need to do it before they delete a listing they made. It is basically used to show them all of their listings, then they choose which one to deleteli ol  pp  precodeSELECT dateListed, isbn13, price  FROM Listings  WHERE userIDuserID  ORDER BY dateListed DESC codepre  ol start6 liHere is the query where they actually deleted the listingli ol  pp  precodeDELETE FROM Listings WHERE userIDuserID AND isbn13isbn13 codepre  pPlease help me make my design efficient. I am not so sure where to index because I am aware that with indexing means it makes updating and deleting harder.. which my program also needs to do. Initially I thought of indexing isbn13 the main thing that will be searched upon, but then realized that I will also be searching upon the latitude and longitude so I am not sure if those also have to be indexed... it is really confusing me. Please tell me anything I can do to improve the design and queries of my database.p

My ojective is that when the user clicks on cancel, I ignore ongoing user changes from the form but I update in my controller some of the fields of the same entity.p  pHere is my issue.

Negative 76 pAll code0code related code examples I have found are related to procedural code IE code inside codebegincodecodeendcode. What about continuous assignments and primitive instantiations The IEEE 1364 amp IEEE 1800 Verilog amp SystemVerilog respectively only give a one line description that I can find Quoting all version of IEEE 1364 under the section name emThe stratified event queueemp  blockquote   pAn explicit zero delay code0code requires that the process be suspended and added as an inactive event for the current time so that the process is resumed in the next simulation cycle in the current time.p blockquote  pI read documents and talked with a few engineers that have been working with Verilog long before the IEEE Std 13641995. In summary, the inactive region was failed solution to synchronizing flipflops with Verilogs indeterminate processing order. Later Verilog created nonblocking assignments codeltcode and resolved the synchronizing with indeterminate order. The inactive region was left in the scheduler to not break legacy code and a few obscure corner cases. Modern guidelines say to avoid the using code0code because it creates race conditions and may hinder simulation performance. The performance impact is a dont care for small designs. I run huge designs that with mixed RTL to transistor level modules. So even small performance gains add up and not having to debug a rouge race conditions are time savers.p  pIve ran test case removingadding code0code to Verilog primitives on large scale designs. Some simulators have notable changes others do not. It is difficult to tell who is doing a better job following the LRM or has a smarter optimizer.p  pAdding a percompile script to remove hard coded forms of code0code, is easy enough. The challenge is with parameterized delay.

I believe parameterized delay has been around longer then the inactive region. I havent found any documentation on recommendation or explanation for these conditions. My local network of VerilogSystemVerilog gurus are all unsure which region it should run in. Is there a detail we are all overlooking or is it a gray area in the language If it is a gray area, how do I determine which way it is implantedp  pAn accepted answer should include a citation to any version of IEEE1364 or IEEE1800.

Negative 76 pI have a script I am trying to run with grunt using the gruntshell plugin. This script prompts for input using coderead p enter foo barcode. When I run it, I get a cursor that correctly takes my input, but I dont see enter foo.p  pI tried modifying the gruntshell config to dump err, stderr, and stdout to the console, but they all come out empty once the command completes. The man page for read says about the p flag The prompt is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal., which seems like it may be my issue since node is calling the prompt, but the read command is executing in my terminal, and I am entering input in a terminal, so why wouldnt that workp  pSo, my question is, is there any way to prompt for user input from the gruntshell pluginp  pAlso, as a P.S., yes i know it would be very easy to just echo the prompt and deal with the input being below it, but dammit its the principle of the thing.p

So any suggestions beyond simply tweaking my computer will require a trip through the bureaucratic swamp.p  pOne possible positive related to this issue is that weve been informed that a number of us need to downgrade from Ultimate to Professional so if your suggestion is to reinstall Visual Studio, the upside is that Ill be doing that soon anyway.p  pThanks,br Dougp  pEDITbr Additional Info I deleted everything in this folderp  pCUsers ...AppDataLocalMicrosoftTeam Foundation5.0Cachep  p... but Im still seeing the error.p  pUPDATE 1242015br I did finally downgrade from Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate to VS2013 Professional, but Im still experiencing the same error.  Might there be a table in the TFS database that still has an entry for my old account that could be joining to my computer name ampor new account name when TFS goes to look up my account info when I check in my changes  I am getting desperate for an answerp  pAn addendum  when the sysadmins changed my account name they did not update my computer itself, so Im still using CUsersoldaccount.

Negative 76 pI noticed that one of my select dropdowns would occasionally not have the correct item selected from the Angular model. I traced it down to be what appears an issue with promises not fulfilling before Angular loads the form. After trying a large amount of different methods, I finally decided to do this nonsense to make it workp  precodeq.all[     scope.categories.promise,     scope.durations.promise,     scope.job.promise,     scope.jobStatuses.promise,     scope.recruiters.promise,     scope.states.promise ].thenfunction       window.setTimeoutfunction          scope.editJob               acceptsVisas scope.job.acceptsVisas,             categoryId scope.job.categoryID,             city scope.job.city,             contact scope.job.contactID,             description scope.job.details,             duration scope.job.durationID,             internalId scope.job.internalReqID,             postal scope.job.postal,             recruiter scope.job.recruiterID,             state scope.job.stateID,             status scope.job.jobStatusID,             title scope.job.title              , 10  codepre  pWithout the setTimeout, the select will occasionally not the wrong recruiter selected. Ive debugged it down to something inside AngularJS. Examining the model shows that the right fields are set before hand, and its not reliably reproducible, which leads me to the assumption that Angular is loading the form before the promise is finished, and then not selecting the right recruiter when it loads the recruiter data. Nothing is being set out of context, this is pretty much all the code aside from the queries being ran on the resources. I also updated the codewindows.setTimeoutcode to use codetimeoutcode, but the main point of needing to do it in the first place remains.p

Negative 76 pI was reading the a hrefhttpwww.jayway.com20140516asyncservlets relnofollowJayWay articlea about Async support on Servlet with Spring.p  pThe interesting part isp  blockquote   pIf your service is expected to receive large request or response bodies, especially if the clients write or read slowly, you would benefit from using the nonblocking IO feature introduced in Servlet 3.1, as mentioned earlier. On the ServletInputStream there is the method setReadListener where you can set a ReadListener.p blockquote  pI saw that you can do something with codeDeferredResultcode in terms of starting the servlet asynchronously but I cannot find information about anything related about codeReadListenercode and codeWriteListenercode.p  pOr at least, I expected something on that side because its kind on the border of my application, I just need to get the request and send a result.p

Negative 76 pIve been looking through various questions here and on wider Google searches but havent come across a suitable answer so Im reaching out with a hopefully new question.p  pIm looking for a tool which would give me the ability to convert discrete selections within a PDF document to HTMLText in the layout format of the source PDF. Ive tried a variety of bulkconversion programs but there are frequent errors in the conversion so Im looking more to select a given chunk of a PDF document and convert only that chunk to HTML or text while maintaining position important for indented text.

Negative 76 pMy repo has multiple projects in subfolders with same structure duplicated across multiple branches.p  pIm trying to set up a job that monitors all branches and triggers a job only when a change in a subdirectory Project1 is made. This way I can check if changes to Project1 work on release branches and any dev branches people might set up.p  pIn theory it seems the Git plugin does let me set this up, by specifying  in Branches to build and Project1. in Included Regions. I also use Poll SCM since that seems to be a prerequisite.p  pThis works fine as long as you make changes only to one branch. Once you make a change outside of the Project1 folder on another branch, Jenkins picks up a changes from any directory.p  pIs this a bug or am I trying to do something that is not supportedp

Negative 76 pI decided to create a very small MVC5 project which I do not wish to spend large amounts of time developing more complex architectures or custom membership providers for.p  pThis is my first experience using the universal provider. p  pI set up an Sql database, and wished to place a foreign key in a table with a field UserIdWhoEnteredDatap  pLooking at the autogenerated universal membership provider tables, the table AspNetUsers, the primary key Id is an nvarchar128 rather than a uniqueIdentifier data type, but has a very UID looking value 5cc5b92f1e5e4e36a8781f645316d182.p  pusing nvarchar as a primary key, and particularly with a length of 128 goes against much of what I understand about database design I am an amateur however. p  ul liWhy did microsoft go this route if UniqueIdentifier is not available in all supported databases, why have a length of 128 characters for a fixed length 36 character string why include the hyphensli liIs this going to have a major impact on performance of database queries, particularly joinsli liShould I therefore change the structure of the table to instead have a field UserstrongNamestrongWhoEnteredData If SQL joins, queries and updates will not run any faster, the only advantage of having the Id field would be its uniqueness  i.e. userName john deletes himself, another userName John registers. However, I dont believe the universal Membership Provider API has existing methods to delete a user anyway, and I wasnt planning on adding any such functionality to such a small project.li ul

Negative 76 pI need something to work like a callback for a Meteor helper, such that it runs every time the helper updatesreturns. I cant include it in the helper definition because a it would run before the helper returns, and b as far as I can tell that code only runs once. Similarly, the Template.foo.rendered callback seems to also only run once not when the helper updates, and not even after the helper returns the first time. So, is there any way to execute code after a Meteor helper returns The only thing I can think of right now is a timer, and that seems quite messy and wrong. Thanksp

Negative 76 pI have a basic game with a game screen that consists of some labelsbuttons with spaces that display numbers once entered, a help screen with just text to explain the game, and a stats screen that fetches game stats from the phone and displays them.p  pThese elements all have outlets and I have used autolayout to change the size of these elements based on which device is used.  But as a result, the text doesnt change size, so I change it with code, and I want to make sure my logic here is correct.p  pAll of the textlabels would load in their text at the undesired size, so I change that size in the viewDidLayoutSubviews method since everything is now laid out and I can then change the size of the text according to the size of the labels.  If I placed them in viewDidLoad or viewDidAppear there will be a short delay between the text as it appears and the change, which doesnt look good.p  pI change the size of the text that WILL be displayed in the spaces that will display entered numbers in the viewDidAppear method, because youre not seeing them until the user presses a button, so it has plenty of time to set the correct size before anything appears on screen.p  pI believe this logic makes sense, since its giving me what I want.  I also println which method is being called in each casetransition and it seems correct.  However I do see that viewDidLayoutSubviews is called every time anything on the screen changes.  Is this correctp  pAlso for some reason anytime I transition to the help screen, viewDidLoad is called.  I thought it calls once when the app loads up and thats it, but now it doesnt seem so  This doesnt happen for any other of my screens so Im a little confused about viewDidLoad, but I dont have any code in there anyways so Im not too worried about that.p

Negative 76 pI am a Master of science Electronics student and my final project is about Real time Sound Processing. I am going to implement Adaptive Filters in MATLAB.

Negative 76 pstrongHello everyone, Im currently stuck working on a school project described as suchstrongp  pYour program should read in the file  in.csv, and adjust the weights of the perceptron so that when given the inputs it was trained with, it provides the corresponding outputs. p  pIn reality, the error may never get to zero when training an ANN the goal is to hopefully make it smart enough to recognize most instances.  For this project start with an error of 5, or 0.05.  This would mean, for example, that the ANN correctly identified 95100 of the inputs, and 05100 were mistakenly classified.
