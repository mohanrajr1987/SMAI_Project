Positive 62752 pI have a WPF window that needs to react to codeSizeChangedcode events.

Positive 62752 pLets say you have a service API call. The callee is somewhat performance critical, so in order not to hold up the API call any longer than necessary, theres an codeSaveAsynccode method that is used. I cant codeawaitcode it, however, because that would hold up the API call just as long or perhaps even longer than the nonasync version.p  pThe reason Im asking is this If you strongdontstrong codeawaitcode the call, is there a chance the codeTaskcode object returned gets garbage collected And if so, would that interrupt the running taskp
Positive 62752 pI have a service that makes use of the Scala Async library. Im using this library primarily to time my database calls.

A pseudo code of what I have is as belowp  precodedef myDbMethod  async    val firstCall  awaitcall the db and get the result    val secondCall  awaitall the db and get the result    val thirdCall  awaitall the db and get the result   ...  codepre  pIn my Scala test unit test, I have p  precodeAwait.resultmyDbMethod, 10.seconds codepre  pI was just trying to debug myMethod by running my unit test which would return with a test success even before getting into the secondCall. I mean I had breakpoints in all the 3 calls to the database, but the IntelliJ debugger would just exit out as soon as it finishes the first call to the database. Why is this How can I test this behaviour using IntelliJ debuggerp
Positive 62752 pVisual Studio emits a warning for this code because this call is not awaited, execution of the current method continues before the call is completed.p  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args      FireAndForget  lt Warning CS4014      Do something else.   static async Task FireAndForget       Do something cannot throw.  codepre  pMy understanding is that it is OK not to wait for the task in this particular case because FireAndForget will never throw an exception.p  pInstead of disabling the warning with a pragma, I was considering changing the return type of FireAndForget from Task to void. That effectively silences the compiler.p  precodestatic async void FireAndForget  lt Task changed to void       Do something cannot throw.  codepre  pHowever, according to a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinejj991977.aspx relnofollowStephen Clearya, async void methods should be avoided so I am not quite sure what to do.p  pIs it OK to have a async void method if the method is not designed to be awaitable in the first place and if no exception will be thrownp

In the first call to codePrintTwoValuescode Im guessing that the return value from codeSomeClass.MyValuecode gets pushed onto the stack.  Then execution continues into codeGetValuecode which just starts the Task and exits.  Then codeDoWorkcode exits and schedules a continuation that will call codePrintTwoValuescode but when that continuation runs the value that had originally gotten pushed on the stack is somehow lost and reverted back to its default value.p  pWhile there are simple ways to workaround this problem, like storing the arguments in temporary variables before passing them to the codePrintTwoValuescode method, Im mostly just curious why this behavior is occurring.p  pNote  Im using Visual Studio 2013, Update 5.  Im building a console application that is targeting .NET Framework 4.5 and running on Windows 10 Enterprise.p

However, I recently had a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq32835391905884this situationa also happened to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq28675265905884othersa. In this instance, the nonblocking behaviour depends on the EF provider. Since the UI layer shouldnt really know or care about the DB provider implementation details, I suppose it makes sense to wrap all calls in Task.Run to ensure nonblocking bahaviour.

The method name ends in Async. async Taskltintgt AccessTheWebAsync        You need to add a reference to System.Net.Http to declare client.

Negative 62752 pJavas codeFile.renameTocode is problematic, especially on Windows, it seems. As the a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavase6docsapijavaioFile.htmlrenameTo28java.io.File29API documentationa says,p  blockquote   pMany aspects of the behavior of this   method are inherently   platformdependent The rename   operation might not be able to move a   file from one filesystem to another,   it might not be atomic, and it might   not succeed if a file with the   destination abstract pathname already   exists. The return value should always   be checked to make sure that the   rename operation was successful.p blockquote  pIn my case, as part of an upgrade procedure, I need to move rename a directory that may contain gigabytes of data lots of subdirectories and files of varying sizes. The move is always done within the same partitiondrive, so theres no real need to physically move all the files on disk.p  pThere emshouldntem be any file locks to the contents of the dir to be moved, but still, quite often, renameTo fails to do its job and returns false. Im just guessing that perhaps some file locks expire somewhat arbitrarily on Windows.p  pCurrently I have a fallback method that uses copying amp deleting, but this sucks because it may take stronga lotstrong of time, depending on the size of the folder. Im also considering simply documenting the fact that the user can move the folder manually to avoid waiting for hours, potentially. But the Right Way would obviously be something automatic and quick.p  pSo my question is, strongdo you know an alternative, reliable approach to do a quick moverename with Java on Windowsstrong, either with plain JDK or some external library. Or if you know an emeasyem way to detect and release any file locks for a given folder and emall of its contentsem possibly thousands of individual files, that would be fine too.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong In this particular case, it seems we got away using just coderenameTocode by taking a few more things into account see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1000183reliablefilerenametoalternativeonwindows10064891006489this answera.p
Negative 62752 pI have one table spread across two servers running MySql 4. I need to merge these into one server for our test environment.p  pThese tables literally have millions of records each, and the reason they are on two servers is because of how huge they are. Any altering and paging of the tables will give us too huge of a performance hit.p  pBecause they are on a production environment, it is impossible for me to alter them in any way on their existing servers.p  pThe issue is the primary key is a unique auto incrementing field, so there are intersections.p  pIve been trying to figure out how to use the mysqldump command to ignore certain fields, but the disablekeys merely alters the table, instead of getting rid of the keys completely.p  pAt this point its looking like Im going to need to modify the database structure to utilize a checksum or hash for the primary key as a combination of the two unique fields that actually should be unique...

Is this a good way to do it Theyd have to first  use an email client such as Outlook or iPhone email to accept the email  appointment request. And if they used Outlook to accept it, theyd have to  have their mobile phone synced to their Exchange server, etc.  Is there any  sample PB.NET code on doing this I know how to send out emails, but I would like help on sending an iCalendar email.p  pAny feedbacksuggestions such as a good websitetool to visitcheck on is  welcome. p

Negative 62752 pFor a database Im building, Ive decided to use natural numbers as the primary key. Im aware of the advantages that GUIDs allow, but looking at the data, the bulk of rows data were GUID keys.p  pI want to generate XML records from the database data, and one problem with natural numbers is that I dont want to expose my database keys to the outside world, and allow users to guess keys. I believe GUIDs solve this problem.p  pSo, I think the solution is to generate a sparse, unique iD derived from the natural ID hopefully it would be 2way, or just add an extra column in the database and store a guid or some other multibyte idp  pThe derived value is nicer because there is no storage penalty, but it would be easier to reverse and guess compared to a GUID.p  pIm buy curious as to what others on SO have done, and what insights they have.p

Negative 62752 pI think i have an UIImage that has a higher retain count than it should have and i am probably leaking memory. I use this image as a thumbnail, to set a custom background to a uibutton. So the uibutton is holding a reference to it and so do i. But instead of 2, the retainCount is 3. Do i have to create a custom UIImage derived class and override dealloc if I want to place a log message there and then change the class used from UIImage to my class, or is there an easier way.

Negative 62752 pI working on a ChineseJapanese learning web app where many tables are indexed by the characters the glyphs of those languages.p  pIm wondering if the integer codepoint value of the glyph would be better for performance than using a single utf8 character for primary key and indexesp  pUsing a single utf8 character would be very useful because I can see the unicode characters fine in the shell Im using, and this makes debugging the SQL queries of this app easier.p  pIn theory MySQL would treat a single utf8 character as a unique integer value similarly to a mediumint 3 bytes... but I suspect MySQL will handle the column as a string instead.p  pWould there be performance issues due to MySQL treating my single utf8 char as a stringp  pWould you recommend to stick to the integer codepoint for indexes and primary keys, and perhaps use CONVERT or other operator to get the utf8 character in resultsp
Negative 62752 pI suppose everyone runs into this problem once in a while you have two tables that have autonumber primary keys that need to be merged. There are many good reasons why autonumber primary keys are used in favour of say applicationgenerated keys, but merging with other tables must be one of the biggest drawbacks.p  pSome problems that arise are overlapping ids and out of sync foreign keys. I would like to hear your approach for tackling this. I always run into problems, so Im very curious if anybody has some sort of a general solution.p  pstrong EDIT strongp  pIn response to the answers suggesting to use guids or other nonnumeric keys, there are situations where in advance it just seems a better idea to use autonumber keys and you regret this later, or youre taking over someone elses project, or you get some legacy database that you have to work with. So Im really looking for a solution where you have no control over the database design anymore.p

This is a very useful feature if your website has a data or temp folder in the same site that isnt part of the source safe.

It still doesnt add the files into Visual SourceSafe thank goodness but it doesp  ol liShows the files in the IDE which is okay except...li liIt therefore searches them which can be very annoyingli liBut finally, it also UPLOADS them to the target web server when publishingli ol  pIts this latter one thats a pain as one of my temporary folder can contain thousands of small temporary files.p  pAnyway to make VS 2008 work the same way on W7 as it does on XPp  pCheers, Rob.p

Negative 62752 pYou can see the combination of software components Im using in the title of the question.  p  pI have a simple 10table database running on a Postgres server Win 7 Pro.  I have client apps python using psycopg to connect to Postgres who connect to the database at random intervals to conduct relatively light transactions.  Theres only one client app at a time doing any kind of heavy transaction, and those are typically lt 500ms.  The rest of them spend more time connecting than actually waiting for the database to execute the transaction.  The point is that the database is under light load, but the load is evenly split between reads and writes.p  pMy client apps run as serversservices themselves.  Ive found that it is pretty common for me to be able to 1 take the Postgres server completely down, and 2 ruin the database by killing the client app with a keyboard interrupt.p  pBy 1, I mean that the Postgres process on the server aborts and the service needs to be restarted.p  pBy 2, I mean that the database crashes again whenever a client tries to access the database after it has restarted and presumably finished recovery mode operations.  I need to delete the old databaseschema from the database server, then rebuild it each time to return it to a stable state.  After recovery mode, I have tried various combinations of Vacuums to see whether that improves stability the vacuums run, but the server will still go down quickly when clients try to access the database again.p  pI dont recall seeing the same effect when I kill the client app using a taskkill  only when using a keyboard interrupt to take the python process down.   It doesnt happen all the time, but frequently enough that its a major concern 25.p  pReally surprised that emanythingem on a client would actually be able to take down an enterprise class database.  Can anyone share tips on how to improve robustness, and hopefully help me to understand why this is happening in the first place  Thanks, Mp

Negative 62752 pIm using TouchJSON to parse the output of a JSON Rails API, but am having difficulties. The overall goal is to loop through the response, parse the JSON, create a codeRoundcode instance for each JSON object, and stick those codeRoundcode objects into an NSArray so I can load this into a codeUITableViewcode. So if theres a more straightforward way to do that than what Im about to show which currently is NOT working, btw please let me know.p  pThe Rails API is returning a collection that looks something like thisp  precode[         round  coursetitle Title A, result 8    ,         round  coursetitle Title B, result 4    ,   ... ] codepre  pIm also using ASIHTTPRequest and I can successfully get the response usingp  precodeNSString responseString  [request responseString] codepre  pBut from there, I cannot seem to get anywhere. Heres moreorless what TouchJSON suggestsp  precodeNSString jsonString  [request responseString]  [round..., ..., round...] NSData jsonData  [jsonString dataUsingEncodingNSUTF32BigEndianStringEncoding] NSDictionary dictionary  [[CJSONDeserializer deserializer] deserializeAsDictionaryjsonData errornil]   then I do this... NSLogJSON , dictionary  JSON null codepre  pI thought from there I would be able to loop through the dictionary and create the object mappings using my codeRoundcode class. But maybe thats the wrong approach altogether.p  pMy thoughts are that the JSON being returned from Rails is an array of JSON objects, so maybe thats why the JSON parser doesnt recognize it as valid JSON From this, I have two questionsp  p1 Should TouchJSON be able to accept an array of JSON objects like what my API is returningp  p2 Is it possible to cast the responseString to an NSArray so I can loop through each round and parse the JSON that way If I remove the first and last characters from the response string i.e. [ and ] the JSON parser will only grab the first round in the collection.p  p3 Am I going about this whole process correctlyp  pAny tipsadvice would be much appreciated.p

Negative 62752 pI have been working on a method to sync core data stored in an iPhone application between multiple devices, such as an iPad or a Mac. There are not many if any at all sync frameworks for use with Core Data on iOS. However, I have been thinking about the following conceptp  ol liA change is made to the local core data store, and the change is saved. a If the device is online, it tries to send the changeset to the server, including the device ID of the device which sent the changeset. b If the changeset does not reach the server, or if the device is not online, the app will add the change set to a queue to send when it does come online.li liThe server, sitting in the cloud, merges the specific change sets it receives with its master database.li liAfter a change set or a queue of change sets is merged on the cloud server, the server pushes all of those change sets to the other devices registered with the server using some sort of polling system. I thought to use Apples Push services, but apparently according to the comments this is not a workable system.li ol  pIs there anything fancy that I need to be thinking about I have looked at REST frameworks such as a hrefhttpiphoneonrails.comObjectiveResourcea, a hrefhttpcoreresource.orgCore Resourcea, and a hrefhttpsgithub.comlukeredpathRestfulCoreDataRestfulCoreDataa. Of course, these are all working with Ruby on Rails, which I am not tied to, but its a place to start. The main requirements I have for my solution arep  ol liAny changes should be sent in the background without pausing the main thread.li liIt should use as little bandwidth as possible.li ol  pI have thought about a number of the challengesp  ol liMaking sure that the object IDs for the different data stores on different devices are attached on the server. That is to say, I will have a table of object IDs and device IDs, which are tied via a reference to the object stored in the database. I will have a record DatabaseId [unique to this table], ObjectId [unique to the item in the whole database], Datafield1, Datafield2, the ObjectId field will reference another table, AllObjects ObjectId, DeviceId, DeviceObjectId. Then, when the device pushes up a change set, it will pass along the device Id and the objectId from the core data object in the local data store. Then my cloud server will check against the objectId and device Id in the AllObjects table, and find the record to change in the initial table.li liAll changes should be timestamped, so that they can be merged.li liThe device will have to poll the server, without using up too much battery.li liThe local devices will also need to update anything held in memory ifwhen changes are received from the server.li ol  pIs there anything else I am missing here What kinds of frameworks should I look at to make this possiblep

Negative 62752 pDelphi 2006s TImage doesnt quite support PNGs.  In order to have images with alpha transparency on my forms I have to load them at runtime.  I can load them at design time but they dont survive, I think because PNGs are not saved in the DFM file.  Im sure this is all hunkydory in the latest Delphi but I cant upgrade right at the moment.p  pAnyway, I was loading them at runtime withp  precodeImage1.Picture.Assign PngImageCollection1.Items [0].PNGImage  codepre  pThe PNGImageCollection component holds all my PNGs of various sizes these are created and loaded at designtime, and I assign them to the respective TImages in the FormCreate event.p  pThis has worked OK, until I had a problem where I was trying to reuse one of these images somewhere else after it had been used on a form.  I discovered that the act of assigning the TPicture had set it to an empty image as a result of the Assign.  This was happening in the routine TPicture.ForceType, which AFAICT checks the type of FGraphic, and if it is not the desired type, it frees FGraphic and creates a new instance of the requested type. p  pOK.  So after a bit of scratching around, I see that maybe I should really be doing thisp  precodeImage1.Picture.Bitmap.Assign PngImageCollection1.Items [0].PNGImage   codepre  pThis did the trick, in that the Assign did not clobber the image, but the image now shows with the semitransparent bits as opaque, i.e.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comm2wbS.png altTImage when assigned with Image1.Picture.Bitmap.Assignp  pinstead ofp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com83Dwm.png altTImage when assigned with Image1.Picture.Assignp  pHow can I get this image to display the alphatransparent bits properly and supplementary question Is Image1.Picture.Bitmap.Assign the correct way to do it.p  pHeres the code in a bit more detailp  pIn the code where I had the problem reusing a TImage, the sequence wasbr On form createp  precodeLogoImage.Picture.Assign PngImageCollection1.Items [0].PNGImage   codepre  pPNGIMage is a company logo, LogoImage1 is on the main form.p  pOn print report header  p  precodeprocedure PrintLogo Report  TBaseReport   var     X1, Y1, LogoHeightMM     Double   begin with Report do     begin     LogoHeightMM   CalcGraphicHeight LogoWidthMM, MainForm.LogoImage.Picture.Graphic      X1             PageWidth  MarginRight  LogoWidthMM      Y1             SectionBottom  LogoHeightMM      PrintBitmapRect X1, Y1, X1  LogoWidthMM, Y1  LogoHeightMM, MainForm.LogoImage.Picture.Bitmap      end  end  codepre  pThe first time the routine to print the logo is called it executes without error, but the LogoImage .Picture is left cleared after the call to PrintBitmapRect.  The next time the print header routine is called, the call to CalcGraphicHeight fails because the width and height of the image are zero.p  pChanging the Picture.Assign to a Picture.Bitmap.Assign fixes the RTE in the header print routine, but when I transplanted the same fix to other static images assigned from PNGs like the gears above I lost the aplha channel.  p

Id also very much like it to support smoothing.p  pWhat I know up to this pointp  ol liTTF uses bezier curves and splinesli liTTF categorizes its points as points defining lines, and points defining curve, the latter being either on the curve in question or our of it control pointsli liOne can make a polygon out of a curve contour where the curved parts are made of lines the size of a pixel.li liOne could use this polygon to render the filled contour and if one also uses the data as floats rather than ints, one could achieve font smoothing.li ol  pSo could you point me to a guide of some sort or somethingp  pThanks.p

Im using a StageWebView object to render web pages, embedded within the rest of my spark layouts.  Im trying to add a gesture event to the component that contains the StageWebView, but since the StageWebView object doesnt belong to the Flex stack it inherits from EventDispatcher, not UIComponent all of my events seem to be getting eaten.

Negative 62752 pIm running an HTML5 video on my page and Id like to make it resize edge to edge in ratio based on the browsers size.

In some browsers this means black bars, in Safari it means literally fullscreen independent of the browser window. I dont want either of these.p  pa hrefhttpvideojs.com relnofollowhttpvideojs.comap  pIdeally, it would function like Supersized does for images.

Negative 62752 pI understand that the proper structure for separationofconcerns in MVC is to have viewmodels for your structuring your views and separate datamodels for persisting in your chosen repository.  I started experimenting with MongoDB and Im starting to think that this may not apply when using a schemaless, NOSQL style database.  I wanted to present this scenario to the stackoverflow community and see what everyones thoughts are.  Im new to MVC, so this made sense to me, but maybe I am overlooking something...p  pHere is my example for this discussion When a user wants to edit their profile, they would go to the UserEdit view, which uses the UserEdit model below.  p  precodepublic class UserEditModel      public string Username              get  return Info.Username          set  Info.Username  value            [Required]     [MembershipPassword]     [DataTypeDataType.Password]     public string Password  get set       [DataTypeDataType.Password]     [DisplayNameConfirm Password]     [ComparePassword, ErrorMessage  The password and confirmation password do not match.]     public string ConfirmPassword  get set       [Required]     [Email]     public string Email  get set       public UserInfo Info  get set      public Dictionaryltstring, boolgt Roles  get set    public class UserInfo  IRepoData      [ScaffoldColumnfalse]     public Guid id  get set       [ScaffoldColumnfalse]     public DateTime Timestamp  get set       [Required]     [DisplayNameUsername]     [ScaffoldColumnfalse]     public string Username  get set       [Required]     [DisplayNameFirst Name]     public string FirstName  get set       [Required]     [DisplayNameLast Name]     public string LastName  get set       [ScaffoldColumnfalse]     public string Theme  get set       [ScaffoldColumnfalse]     public bool IsADUser  get set   codepre  pNotice that the UserEditModel class contains an instance of UserInfo that inherits from IRepoData  UserInfo is what gets saved to the database.  I have a generic repository class that accepts any object that inherits form IRepoData and saves it so I just call codeRepository.SavemyUserInfocode and itss done.  IRepoData defines the id MongoDB naming convention and a Timestamp, so the repository can upsert based on id and check for conflicts based on the Timestamp, and whatever other properties the object has just get saved to MongoDB.  The view, for the most part, just needs to use codeHtml.EditorForcode and we are good to go Basically, anything that just the view needs goes into the basemodel, anything that only the repository needs just gets the code[ScaffoldColumnfalse]code annotation, and everything else is common between the two. emBTW  the username, password, roles, and email get saved to .NET providers, so that is why they are not in the UserInfo object.emp  pThe strongbig advantagesstrong of this scenario are twofold...p  ol lipI can use strongless codestrong, which is therefore more easily understood, faster to develop, and more maintainable in my opinion.pli lipI can strongrefactorstrong in seconds... If I need to add a second email address, I just add it to the UserInfo object  it gets added to the view and saved to the repository just by adding one property to the object.  Because I am using MongoDB, I dont need to alter my db schema or mess with any existing data.pli ol  pGiven this setup, is there a need to make separate models for storing data  What do you all think the disadvantages of this approach are  I realize that the obvious answers are standards and separationofconcerns, but are there any real world examples can you think of that would demonstrate some of the headaches this would causep  pIts also worth noting that Im working on a team of two developers total, so its easy to look at the benefits and overlook bending some standards.  Do you think working on a smaller team makes a difference in that regardp

Negative 62752 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7265371howtoproperlygenerateexceptionsinphpdojowhenreturningjavascriptcode78694387869438Herea I have asked a question pertaining to exceptions raised when dynamically loading scripts via XMLHttpRequest in other words when executed via codeevalcodep  pIn a related question, I wanted to know whether loading scripts dynamically as such is considered bad practice to begin with. In my particular case I have an HTML Canvas element, and rather than load all possible shapes, I want to fetch them dynamically, without reloading the page, and execute them on return. The problem I am having there is that if the code associated with that shape is incorrect, the error message displayed is not very useful indicates location of codeevalcode statement, not incorrect statement. Is there another way to dynamically fetch code from the server and execute it, while better informing the location of the exception when it occurs. p

Negative 62752 pim struggling a bit with this subject since I come from the world of PHP where you dont have anything like Core Data as far as i know.p  pUntil today, when i needed a data model for saving data from the server , lets say i got some users from an API, i would create an NSObject class called MyAppUser , and on the .h file would have the properties for that data and synthesize it in the .m , and then just use that class for arranging my serverdata in nice neat objects.p  pI read a bit about Core Data , and it seems its mainly for actually storing the data in some sort of database, which isnt what i want. What i want is actually just have organized objects with data from my server returned to me. Could i do this with Core Data just have objects but without actually managing them and storing them p  pThank you and sorry if my question is a bit scattered br  Shai.p

Negative 62752 pI have developed a WCF service that has been working fine for a few weeks now.  I publish this service to IIS directly from the development server.  I have a dev test app that includes this WCF service as a Service Reference in its own project.p  pMy WCF class library also references another project within the Visual Studio solution, and many classes are in the referenced project that are used by the service and calling applications.p  pToday, after publishing some changes to the service I did not make ANY changes to the referenced project or its classes, three of about 20 of the classes in the referenced project are no longer in the service reference of my test app.  I cannot use them in code any longer, and they are no longer in the Reference.cs.  I double checked, the classes in question are still decorated with [DataContract] and the properties are all still decorated with [DataMember] in the service solution.p  pEverything is building in Visual Studio OK.. I have rebuilt and republished everything, the missing classes are set to compile, I have tried IIS resets, completely deleted the IIS site and did a clean republish, no avail.  I have tried deleting the service reference on the test app and getting a clean proxy every time as well.  Nothing is working.p  pI then tried making a dummy class in the referenced project and built it in.  Republished the service again, and even this dummy class does not appear in the Reference.cs.  I am at a complete loss as to why these classes are not included in the .dll for the referenced project after it is published as it is evident that everything is building OK in Visual Studio.p
Negative 62752 pAlright... so on my forms, I am setting all the fields to something like thisp  pcodenameformdata[name]code and codenameformdata[active]code.p  pOf course, that means whatever is entered in those fields should be stored in codePOST[formdata][name]code and codePOST[formdata][active]code.p  pI do my values that way because I pass the formdata to a couple of functions I have written which work as they should. Now lets say Im using this to edit an item or add a new item  the name will go through those functions as it should and the item will save with its name, but active will never save as it should. The entry field is a checkbox  if its checked, the value is 1.p  pIf I codeprintrPOST[formdata]code after entering Name and checking active, I get this codeArray  [name] gt Name [active] gt 1 code.p  pLooks fine, right But when I do the followingp  precodeif issetPOST[formdata][active] echo Error 1 if emptyPOST[formdata][active] echo Error 2 if POST[formdata][active]  1 echo Error 3 codepre  pThey all return errors I am baffled by this.

Negative 62752 pThis questions seems easy, but I am not able to understand the real work behind it. I know people will say, break down into 512 Megs chunks and sort them like using Merge Sort using Map reduce.p  pSo here is the actual question i have p  pSuppose i break the file into 512 Megs chunk and then send to different host machines to sort them. suppose these machines used the Merge Sort. Now say, i had 2000 machines each sorted 2000, 512 megs of chunk. Now when i merge them back, how does that work Wont the size keep on increasing again For example merging two 512 megs will make 1024Megs which is size of my RAM so how would this work Any machine cant merge a chunk of more than 512 megs chunk with another chunk because then size  1 GB.p  pHow at the end of merging will i ever be able to merge two 0.5 TB chunk with another 0.5 TB chunk.. Does the concept of Virtual Memory come into play herep  pI am here to clarify my basics and i hope i am asking this very important question correctly correctly. Also, who should do this mergeafter sorting My machine or few of those 2000 machines p

Negative 62752 pI have various database fields that are decrypted using the codetopythoncode method. The problem Im having is that every time I access the admin section codeadmin.ModelAdmincode list for this particular model, the page takes ages to load. I dont need the codetopythoncode method to decrypt fields on the list page, as the fields or the columns Im listing arent encrypted at all. When a user clicks on an item to edit it, the codetopythoncode method kicks in, which is fine, exactly as intended. However, how can I stop the codetopythoncode method trying to decrypt the objects while listing them, bearing in mind the list view shows only fields that are not encrypted Also, this is causing the filter to work really slowly. Again, the filtering is only done on nonencrypted fields so there shouldnt be a need for the codetopythoncode method to execute itself.p

Negative 62752 pI have a phonegap iOS app that i ported to webos on the touchpad the app works great except for the one iOS plugin that i used.  it basically saved the canvas data to the photo roll.  From my understanding of webos i will need to create a node.js service and write the data to a buffer and finally to the file system, there is an example for that in the forums.  however what i can not figure out is how to call all of this from my phonegap app.  I believe i will need to have the following in my index.html file.p  precode    ltscript srcoptPalmSDKCurrentshareframeworkenyo1.0frameworkenyo.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt  and something like     enyo.createkind Main.renderIntodocument.body     codepre  pmy guess i will also have to have all of the kind data in a js file.  but how do i do the little step from my apps js file to communicate with the service that is created.

Negative 62752 pIm trying to create a reuseable MonoTouch library that contains Views defined in a xib, and Controller code written in ObjectiveC.p  ul liI have created a static ObjectiveC library that contains the relevant controller code with all the outlets declared.br A static .a library obviously cant contain xibnib data if this is possible can someone please let me know, so I cant embed the xibsnibs in this library.li liI have created a MonoTouch Binding Project that defines the relevant wrapper classes.br This is where I would ideally also embed the xibsnibs, and have them included in the app bundle of any final project that links this dll.li ul  pNow looking at what a MonoTouch Library Project does with xibs  it compiles it to a nib using ibtool, and then embeds it as a resource in the resultant library dll using the res option of smcs.

Is this possible at all using a MonoTouch Binding Project p  pI havent tried it yet, but Im assuming I could get it working manually by combining what the Library project does with ibtool and smcs res and what the Binding Project does with btouch and smcs.

Negative 62752 pThis is what I am trying to accomplish I have a code that generates a paragraph tag and a div tag, depending on what button is clicked. If I generate a paragraph or a div, I can click either one to select, and click again to deselect. If I select the paragraph that is being generated the background color changes a textarea editor shows up, if i deselect, it hides. The same task applies to the div tag. The problem I have for example is that, if I select the p tag and then I try to select the div tag it just swipes textarea editors and I want to prevent that like this If the element is selected just show the textarea editor for that particular element until I deselect. Then I can select another element and on.p  pHere is a link if you want to check my project out so you can better understand, and edit if you wish to. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netRzvV597 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netRzvV597ap  pjQueryp  precodedocument.readyfunction   Test.onclick, .testp, function           editEl  this          editord.hide          editorp.show          editorp textarea.valeditEl.html  Test.onclick, .testd, function           editdiv  this          editorp.hide          editord.show          editord textarea.valeditdiv.html   editorp textarea.changefunction  editEl.htmleditorp textarea.val  editord textarea.changefunction  editdiv.htmleditord textarea.val  editorp textarea.changefunction  editEl.htmleditorp textarea.val  editord textarea.changefunction  editdiv.htmleditord textarea.val   var pid  1 addP.on     click function         var pr  ltp gt.attrclasstestp, idparagraph  pid.textThis is a paragraph   pid         var d  Test         var pclone  pr.clone         pclone.on             mouseenter function                     this.addClassinside             ,             mouseleave function                                              this.removeClassinside              ,                              pclone.appendTod pid       var divid  1 addDiv.on     click function              var div  ltdiv gt.attrclasstestd, iddiv  divid.textThis is a div   divid                var d  Test              var pclone  div.clone              pclone.on              mouseenter function                     this.addClassinside              ,              mouseleave function                                              this.removeClassinside               ,                              pclone.appendTod divid        var div   ltdiv classcustomD iddgtltdivgt var del  lta href classdelete iderasegtDeleteltagt  var flag  false Test.onclick, p, div, function      var cur  this.cssbackgroundcolor       ifcurrgb255, 255, 255             ifflagfalse                this.cssbackgroundcolor,FDD.addClasshelp insider.afterdiv                 flag  true                else        editorp.hide      editord.hide        this.cssbackgroundcolor,white.removeClasshelp insider       div.remove  flag  false              div.appenddel    .delete.onclick,function     this.parent.prev.remove     this.remove editorp.hide  flag  false      codepre  pThanksp

If I do this, I know that my unit test will fail because the expected value is 1052 and now the codeMarylandProductcode is returning something other than what is expected.p  pAm I just going about this the wrong way  Am I just missing the spirit of TDD Thanks for any help.p  pEDIT adding in other mocking frameworks that I have triedp  precode[TestMethod]     public void rhinoMockCalculateCostForMarylandProduct          assign         IProduct marylandProduct  MockRepository.GenerateMockltIProductgt         marylandProduct.Stubprice gt price.price.Return1000         marylandProduct.Stubtax gt tax.tax.Return0.07          const double EXPECTED  1052          act         double actual  marylandProduct.calculateCost          assert         Assert.AreEqualEXPECTED, actual           [TestMethod]     public void moqCalculateCostForMarylandProduct          assign         var marylandProduct  new MockltIProductgt         marylandProduct.Setupprice gt price.price.Returns1000         marylandProduct.Setuptax gt tax.tax.Returns0.07          const double EXPECTED  1052          act         double actual  MarylandProductmarylandProduct.Object.calculateCost          assert         Assert.AreEqualEXPECTED, actual      codepre  pI want to avoid putting duplicate code in the unit test and in the implementation of the class because if the code in the class changes then the unit test will still pass because it hasnt been changed.

Negative 62752 pLooking at the AvatarNode solution used by Facebook to provide HA for the HDFS Namenode, I dont understand the reason why NFS is used.  Whats confusing to me is that NFS has to replicate anyway in order to achieve HA.  The primary has to write to NFS and flush in order to have HA.  Why not simply open up a socket channel between the primary and the secondary and perform the same writes to the secondary Namenode.  It would be approximately the same amount of network traffic and would seem to have the same replication semantics.p  pSo the question is, why isnt this donep  pI suppose that one reason could be that NFS exists and so the problem may be perhaps simpler to implement.  But given the apparent simplicity of using raw socket channels between the primary and secondary writing the same information thats written to the stream interface i.e. a file to NFS, Im left scratching my head as to why this hasnt been done yet.p  pSurely there must be some good reason for opting to use NFS that Im missing in my armchair analysis.p

Negative 62752 pGuys I am going crazy over this and I know there are allot of contraints using javascript, but the site I am building only has html files. I can use php as well, but it needs to be a seperate file that can be referenced, but not included. The final extension needs to be .html p  pThat said I am making a photo of the day script to take a directory of images with image names that contain dates. for example todays image of the day is strong20120822.jpgstrong and there is a huge directory of images going until the end of the year.

Negative 62752 pI have a MasterDetail application for iPad. I am using storyboard. When the user selects a cell in codeMasterViewcontrollercode, data is displayed in another table codeUITableViewControllercode. When the user selects a cell in the second table, I want to display the related information in the codeDetailViewControllercode.

This is clearly adding columns. I know that  rank is    i.e. infinity and a is rank 2. I cant translate this into imagining why it adds columns, unfortunately. I am reading J for C Programmersp  pSo just for fun I didp  precode1 a 7 8 codepre  pSo now its adding rows. Clearly I changed the rank of  to 1, which is less then 2 the rank of a which means... I dont know. Why am I now adding rows by switching form infinity to 1 p  pWhat aboutp  precode0 a 2 3 2 3 2 3 codepre  pSo now we are just adding single cells with nothing so we get an array equal to the original a. Again I dont know why, although I can just about muddle through an argument to get here verb rank is less than a the noun rank, so we use this value, which is zero, so we add 0cells, ie. we add each cell in turn individually.p  pAnd once more for luckp  precode2 a 5 5 5 codepre  pAnd Im adding columns again. I dont know the mechanism which is choosing which rowscolumnscells get added as the verb rank is changed. Were adding columns but form my point of view, we could just as easily be adding rows.p  pI would like this explained if possible. As I said Im reading some literature but Im still finding it tough. p

Negative 62752 pI read a thoughtful a hrefhttpblog.thinkasync.com201004systemerrorsupportinc0xpart1.htmlseries of blog postsa about the new codeltsystemerrorgtcode header in C11.  It says that the header defines an codeerrorcodecode class that represents a specific error value returned by an operation such as a system call.  It says that the header defines a codesystemerrorcode class, which is an exception class inherits from coderuntimeexceptioncode and is used to wrap codeerrorcodescodes.p  pWhat I want to know is how to actually convert a system error from codeerrnocode into a codesystemerrorcode so I can throw it.  For example, the POSIX codeopencode function reports errors by returning 1 and setting codeerrnocode, so if I want to throw an exception how should I complete the code belowp  precodevoid x      fd  openfoo, ORDWR     if fd  1              throw  need some code here to make a stdsystemerror from errno        codepre  pI randomly triedp  precodeerrno  ENOENT throw stdsystemerror codepre  pbut the resulting exception returns no information when codewhatcode is called.p  pI know I could do codethrow errnocode but I want to do it the right way, using the new codeltsystemerrorgtcode header.p  pThere is a constructor for codesystemerrorcode that takes a single codeerrorcodecode as its argument, so if I can just convert codeerrnocode to codeerrorcodecode then the rest should be obvious.p  pThis seems like a really basic thing, so I dont know why I cant find a good tutorial on it.p  pI am using gcc 4.4.5 on an ARM processor, if that matters.p

The code for my class srcfinalprojectMyLinkLayer.clj looks like p  precodens finalproject.MyLinkLayer   genclass  defn init[s] print s defn send [dest data len] println data defn recv [trans] println trans defn status [] println I am a status defn command [cmd value] println str cmd  with value value codepre  pMy project.clj is p  precodedefproject finalproject 0.1.0SNAPSHOT   description A simulated MAC layer.   dependencies [[org.clojureclojure 1.4.0]                  [localclassFiles 1]]   aot [finalproject.MyLinkLayer] codepre  pThe class compiles lein compile fine into targetclassesfinalproject, but the methods dont show up.  I can load the class via jar using Maven in the top Java part of my project imports of the package work well enough.  I even checked the .class file with Eclipse, and the only methods generated are those from Object.  Any thoughts  Also, once I actually get to the stateful part of my Clojure class, does anyone have any ideas  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 62752 pIm using a MySQL database. I have two tables, Table 1 and Table 2. There is a composite primary key in Table 1.

However, this seems like a relational error in the database and I would like to have a clean, correctlyfunctioning DB. Is there a way to correct this minor problemp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I was using phpMyAdmin to implement my database and apparently there is no way of implementing composite foreign keys in phpMyAdmin. I was able to look at my incorrectlyimplemented foreign key viap  pcodeSHOW CREATE TABLE Table2codep  pwhere codeTable2code is the name of my second table with the composite foreign key.p  pThen I correctly added composite foreign key manually viap  pcodeALTER TABLE Table2 ADD CONSTRAINT myfkconstraintbr FOREIGN KEY menuid, categoryidbr REFERENCES Table1menuid, categoryidcodep  pwhere codemyfkconstraintcode is the name of the constraint being added.p  pstrongNotestrong Manually adding foreign key constraints this way does not allow you to use a dropdown menu when inserting new entries nor referring to the corrresponding table by clicking on the FK columns, as you would normally be able to in phpMyAdmin.p  pThanks codepstcode and codethedayofcondorcode, you are both correct because Im a smalldicked freak using phpMyAdmin.p

Iterablesgt auto chainIterablesampamp... iters     gt ChainObjectltIterables...gt      return  ...   codepre  pAnd the corresponding mainp  precodeint main      stdvectorltintgt vec   1, 2, 3, 4, 5      stdlistltintgt   li    6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13      for autoamp i chainvec, li               You can edit a range of iterables          as if there was only one of them.         i  5          stdcout ltlt i ltlt stdendl          return 0  codepre  pThat main worked fine. We dont care what there is in ChainObject for the problem, so lets see it. I tried to use template templates to ensure that the different collections used had the same codevaluetypecode and modified the function codechaincode the following wayp  precodetemplatelttypename T, templatelttypename...gt class... Iterablesgt auto chainIterablesltTgtampamp... iters     gt ChainObjectltT, Iterables...gt      return  ...   codepre  pI thought this would do the trick to ensure the codelistcode and codevectorcode from my previous main share a same type, but instead, I get the following error from GCC 4.7.1p  blockquote   pIn function int mainp      perror no matching function for call to chainstdvectoramp, stdlistampp      pnote candidates arep      pnote codeChainObjectltT, Iterables ...gt chainIterablesltTgtampamp ...

However, I really dont understand why my first version worked fine, and note the one using template templates.p

Negative 62752 pHere is my situationp  pI have multiple servers under a load balancer. My users are able to upload files to the server. These files need to modify and sent to another server. So to do that I decided to use Gearman to manage queues of the PHP scripts that will do the work.p  pHere is the problem. What happens if one server goes down... Then gearman executes the code to get a particular file but that file was on the server that went down. How can I setup gearman to wait for the server that went down to finally get the right file... Also it might happen that the servers might not go down but since gearman talks to the other servers it might execute the code on another machine looking for a file that is on another server.p  pHow can I get around this problem  Without having to isolate each gearman servers from each other. Because I will use it for other things that dont have the same restrains.p

Ive gotten my program working compressing and decompressing any text file with a pretty large number of characters e.g. the program source works flawlessly.

Negative 62752 pI need to automate the extraction of a products catalog, for which we are authorized distributors. The company is Ingram Micro and theyre huge, but they dont provide a simple way like a web service to query their catalog and stock, so weve been extracting it with LWPUserAgent so far, daily, for our online store database.p  pRecently, they changed their website, and theres something that I just cant detect preventing my Perl script from doing a succesful login. If I try directly on the browser, I login succesfully, but If I try submiting the form from Perl, I get the login page again like an unsuccessful login.p  pTheir site is made on AspNet and full of hidden form fields generated by ASP. At first, I was doing my own spider to get the login page, read all the hidden field values and include them in my POST login request along with the username and password, but now, after this problem, I started using WWWMechanize to do the requests and have that task automated correctly.p  pHowever, not WWWMechanize or LWPUserAgent are able to do a succesful login.p  pIve even tried looking at the exact HTTP conversation between the browser and the server, and including the same exact headers on my automated request with the correct POST content, and even doing that I get an unsuccesful login from Perl and a succesful login from the browser.p  pIm really desperate, I just cannot detect the problem and we are not able to run the store without this catalog update.p  pYou can see the login page here a hrefhttpswww.imstores.comingrammicromx relnofollowhttpswww.imstores.comingrammicromxap  pPlease, if someone has experience with a similar issue or someone can look at that page and detect what makes a browser different from a WWWMechanize request, please let me know.p  pThank you.p

Negative 62752 pI recently started learning about CUDA, and read about how blocks, threads and warps work. So I wrote a very simple program  it adds 2 to an array. The program works fine but then I wanted to see how different size of blocks and threads per block will affect my performance. My code is as followsp  precodedefine N 1000000 define threads 32  global void addTwo int in, int out       int tid    threadIdx.x  blockIdx.xthreads      if tid lt N            out[tid]  in[tid]2         codepre  pp  precodeint main void   int in[N], out[N] int devin, devout   cudaMalloc void ampdevin, N  sizeofint cudaMalloc void ampdevout, N  sizeofint cudaEventt start, stop cudaEventCreateampstart cudaEventCreateampstop cudaEventRecord start, 0 cudaMemcpydevin, in, Nsizeofint, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice  int blocks  Nthreads  1 addTwoltltltblocks, threadsgtgtgt  devin, devout  cudaMemcpyout, devout, Nsizeofint, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost  cudaEventRecordstop, 0 cudaEventSynchronizestop float time cudaEventElapsedTimeamptime, start, stop printf CUDA time 3.5f n, time1000 codepre  p...p  pSo, the code seems to work fine  the results are correct. However, when I run the program with N blocks of 1 thread each, I do as well or better than when I split the threads into warps. This boggles my mind one explanation I was giving myself is that the memory access takes so long the benefits of splitting work fade I would really appreaciate an insight into what Im doing wrong here.p

Negative 62752 pI have a problem with a Grails based application that is connected to MySQL where there is a process that updates a record as part of a larger transaction. This process also kicks off a 2nd thread via a Quartz job that will perform some additional changes. The Quartz job typically starts before the first thread commits the transaction therefore the job loops up to one minute checking for the record to change to the expected state. Oddly it works consistently in some environments, fails consistently in one and infrequently in yet another.p  pMy question has to do with how MySQL recognizes transaction commits between two concurrent connections. One would expect that when connection A performs the commit, that subsequent queries from connection B would recognize the committed change. In my case connection B will have made the same query one or more times before connection A has made the commit. It appears that mySQL is caching the query results for the connection. Oddly enough, while connection B is repeatedly querying and getting the old value, I can issue the same query via the mysql client and see the new value. Does anyone aware of a caching issue or concurrency issuesp  pFor the above observation I have the MySQL log enabled in order to see the individual update, commits and queries occurring.p  pThe various environments are using different versions of MySQL as shown below.

Negative 62752 pAccording to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary8ef0s5kh28vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowSecurity Enhancements in the CRTa and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms17575928vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowSecure Template Overloadsa, it is possible to disable warnings associated with functions deprecated due to safety issue using CRTSECURENOWARNINGS. It is also possible to replace some of the functions with their safer counterpart using CRTSECURECPPOVERLOADSTANDARDNAMES. However, does anybody know if both can be used simultaneously. That is, if I first specify CRTSECURECPPOVERLOADSTANDARDNAMES and then CRTSECURENOWARNINGS, will those functions that can be replaced be replaced and for remaining cases the warnings are suppressed. Im not sure how to test this, because if I add both, all warnings will effectively be suppressed, but I dont know if it is only due to the second flag.p

Negative 62752 pSo here is my situation First of all, all of my printing code is stored in a module, which is called when I click the print button. My problem is, my pages print fine the first time I print my document, but if I click print again, the pages start printing on top of one another. When I debug, e.hasmorepages will be set to false, but it loops around and runs the printpage event again a couple times... Im confused why it loops several times even though hasmorepages is definitely set to false The fact that usually prints right the first time but not the second time I click print makes the think something needs to be disposed. I know my page number variable is set to 1 before each print so it isnt that. The code I am using used to work until I moved it to its own module. p  pNote When I click print, i choose if I want a delivery recipt. if no, a store copy and customer copy are printed. If yes then Store, customer, and delivery copy are printed. Usually the Store and customer copy are printed on top of one another but the delivery copy is correct, so 2 pages are printed instead of 3.p  pHere is the basic outline of my modulep  precodeImports System.Drawing Imports System.Drawing.Printing  Module Receipt2 Public copy As Integer Dim row As Integer  Dim ItemsRowCount As Integer  Invoice.dgvInvoiceItems.RowCount Private Doc As New PrintDocument  Public Sub printInvoice      Try         copy  1          AddHandler Doc.PrintPage, AddressOf PrintPrintPage         Doc.Print         row  0         Doc.Dispose          copy  1      Catch ex As Exception         MessageBox.Showex.Message     End Try End Sub  Private Sub PrintPrintPageByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs       Try          RECEIPT ITEMS PRINTED HERE           print Storecustomer copy and sig line         If copy  1 Then             g.DrawStringStore Copy, New FontVerdana, 15, FontStyle.Italic, Brushes.DarkRed, 50, 1045               e.HasMorePages  True             copy  copy  1             row  0             Exit Sub         ElseIf copy  2 Then             g.DrawStringCustomer Copy, New FontVerdana, 15, FontStyle.Italic, Brushes.DarkRed, 50, 1045               If Invoice.boolDeliveryReceipt  True Then                 e.HasMorePages  True                 copy  copy  1                 row  0                 Exit Sub             End If          ElseIf copy  3 Then             g.DrawStringDelivery Copy, New FontVerdana, 15, FontStyle.Italic, Brushes.DarkRed, 50, 1045           End If           e.HasMorePages  False      Catch ex As Exception          MessageBox.Showex.Message      End Try End Sub End Module codepre  pThanks so much for taking the time to look this over Ive spent hours trying to track the problem down and just not having any luck.p

Ive read somewhere one of the issues could be using a 32 bits Java on a 64 bits system.p  pMy code below, also opensourced at a hrefhttpscode.google.compjake2t relnofollowhttpscode.google.compjake2tap  precode    private void renderSideBySide          glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, 0         glBindFramebufferEXTGLFRAMEBUFFEREXT, sbsFboId           Render side by side         glPushAttribGLALLATTRIBBITS         glPushMatrix          glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION         glLoadIdentity         gluOrtho2D0, width, 0, height         glMatrixMode GLMODELVIEW         glLoadIdentity           glViewport0,0,width,height           glClearColor0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f         glClear GLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT          glDisableGLDEPTHTEST         glDisableGLLIGHTING         glDisableGLBLEND         glDisableGLALPHATEST         glDisableGLCULLFACE          int shaderId  sbsShader.getId         glDisableGLTEXTURE2D          ARBShaderObjects.glUseProgramObjectARBshaderId          if postFboTextureLocation[0] lt 0              postFboTextureLocation[0]  ARBShaderObjects.glGetUniformLocationARBshaderId, leftTexture                  if postFboTextureLocation[1] lt 0              postFboTextureLocation[1]  ARBShaderObjects.glGetUniformLocationARBshaderId, rightTexture                  if postFboDepthTextureLocation[0] lt 0              postFboDepthTextureLocation[0]  ARBShaderObjects.glGetUniformLocationARBshaderId, leftDepthTexture                  if postFboDepthTextureLocation[1] lt 0              postFboDepthTextureLocation[1]  ARBShaderObjects.glGetUniformLocationARBshaderId, rightDepthTexture                    Load the images with the colors and the depth values         glActiveTextureGLTEXTURE0         glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, postFboTextureId[0]         ARBShaderObjects.glUniform1iARBpostFboTextureLocation[0], 0          glActiveTextureGLTEXTURE1         glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, postFboTextureId[1]         ARBShaderObjects.glUniform1iARBpostFboTextureLocation[1], 1          glActiveTextureGLTEXTURE2         glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, postFboDepthTexture[0]         ARBShaderObjects.glUniform1iARBpostFboDepthTextureLocation[0], 2          glActiveTextureGLTEXTURE3         glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, postFboDepthTexture[1]         ARBShaderObjects.glUniform1iARBpostFboDepthTextureLocation[1], 3           glBegin GLQUADS         glTexCoord2f0.0f, 0.0f         glVertex2i 0, 0         glTexCoord2f1.0f, 0.0f         glVertex2i width, 0         glTexCoord2f1.0f, 1.0f         glVertex2i width, height         glTexCoord2f0.0f, 1.0f         glVertex2i 0, height          glEnd                                                              ARBShaderObjects.glUseProgramObjectARB0           Rendering with warping         glPopMatrix         glPopAttrib          unbindFBO           public void drawPostFBOs          renderSideBySide          glPushAttribGLALLATTRIBBITS         glPushMatrix          glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION         glLoadIdentity         gluOrtho2D0, width, 0, height         glMatrixMode GLMODELVIEW         glLoadIdentity           glViewport0,0,width,height           glClearColor0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f         glClear GLCOLORBUFFERBIT          glDisableGLDEPTHTEST         glDisableGLLIGHTING         glDisableGLBLEND         glDisableGLALPHATEST         glDisableGLCULLFACE         glDisableGLTEXTURE2D          int shaderId  riftShader.getId          ARBShaderObjects.glUseProgramObjectARBshaderId          if sbsFboTextureLocation lt 0              sbsFboTextureLocation  ARBShaderObjects.glGetUniformLocationARBshaderId, tex                   glActiveTextureGLTEXTURE0         glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, sbsFboTextureId         ARBShaderObjects.glUniform1iARBsbsFboTextureLocation, 0           glBegin GLQUADS         glTexCoord2f0.0f, 0.0f         glVertex2i 0, 0         glTexCoord2f1.0f, 0.0f         glVertex2i width, 0         glTexCoord2f1.0f, 1.0f         glVertex2i width, height         glTexCoord2f0.0f, 1.0f         glVertex2i 0, height          glEnd                                                              ARBShaderObjects.glUseProgramObjectARB0           glPopMatrix         glPopAttrib      codepre

Negative 62752 pI have a existing code where the application generates different sql depend of lot of conditions and execute them via hibernate sessions createSQLQuery. In here the parameters are concat to the sql string which reside in the java class as normal string replacement. The problem here is now i need to prevent sql injections. So for that i have to use getNamedQuery and bind the parameters so hibernate will take care of special characters. But the problem is moving the string sqls to xml file is a overhead because conditionally generating sqls. So i decide to manually do the special character validation and append it to the string query and execute as it is now.  So then i check the source for PrepareStatement i found, it just throw a exception p  precodebyte[] arrayOfByte1  new byte[0] try     arrayOfByte1  CharsToBytesthis.OdbcApi.charSet, arrayOfChar     catch UnsupportedEncodingException localUnsupportedEncodingException   codepre  pHow can i do same kind of encoding in the java class as above for the parameters before concat them with the string query for eliminate sql injections Or is there any way i can still keep the string sql as it is an append parameters and use hibernate to execute the queryp

Negative 62752 pWhile reading the JavaScript documentation I came across a a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptGuideExpressionsandOperatorsLogicaloperators relnofollowsectiona that confused mep  pLogical operators are typically used with Boolean logical values when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the ampamp and  operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with nonBoolean values, they may return a nonBoolean value. The logical operators are described in the following table.p  precodeampamp Operator expr1 ampamp expr2 codepre  pLogical AND Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, ampamp returns true if both operands are true otherwise, returns false.p  precode Operator expr1  expr2 codepre  pLogical OR Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values,  returns true if either operand is true if both are false, returns false.p  pLets say you havep  precodevar a3  false ampamp true  codepre  pso taking into the consideration the rule for the and operator, the variable a3 should contain the value true since false cannot be converted to false. p

Negative 62752 pI have an iOS app that uses iAds and Admob as a secondary provider when there are no iAds to display.p  pI have an issue where the app is slowing downcrashing which looks like it is related to low memory on the device.p  pInitially, I thought it may be a memory leak but I believe I have tracked it down to data being stored in the Cache directory under Documents amp Data.  It appears that my app and many others that I use have this problem.  The data in this folder constantly increases in size and can cause problems when the device gets short on memory.  There are 2 folders created in the Caches folder 1 for Admob and another I assume for iAds.p  pThere are a couple of options I was considering to resolve this issue.p  ol lipDelete the cached data when it becomes too large.  This is fairly easy to do but not sure if I am allowed to do this under the terms and conditions of iAdsAdmob.pli lipLimit the size of the caches folder.  Is this possiblepli ol  pI have searched on Google, Admob etc but cannot find the answer to the correct way to resolve this issue.  I thought iOS dealt with cases where the memory got too low by automatically clearing out the cache folders but I dont think this is happening.  This is annoying for users as they have no way of removing the cached data without uninstalling their apps.p

Negative 62752 pIm working on a media server, where each video will have a little star next to it. A JQuery event handler is attached to the button, so that clicking the button will result in an AJAX POST request to the servers favorites page, sending along the unique id of the video to be favorited. Then, the JQuery will toggle the image if not favorited, a click will make the star glow, if favorited, a click will make the star transparent again. p  pIf the user is not logged in, they obviously cannot favorite videos. I want the user to be redirected to the login page when they click on the favorites button. However, the AJAX response means that a favorite button click from a nonauthenticated user WILL toggle the favorites button image, which should not happen.

Negative 62752 pI am working on a mobile game project using LibGDX that requires me to combine several sprites together and draw them into a FBO.  Basically, I am trying to draw groups of sprites to a texture at 1.0 alpha so I can draw those textures back to the FBO at a lower opacity and it will look like one big piece.  The problem I am having is that I need to make several of these and the textures can end up being quite large, and creating all of these textures and retaining all of them at once does not sound like an ideal solution at all.  p  pWhat I am trying to do instead is work with the textures one at a time from within the FBO itself, which I emthinkem sounds feasible, but I cannot quite figure out how to make that work either.  In order to combine the sprites onto a texture, like I described earlier, I believe I need to do that drawing in a separate FBO and get the texture from that.  I am not sure how efficient stoppingstarting FBOs is, but even just as a test I tried to stop the main FBO, draw to the temporary one that is used to make each of these textures, and then restart the main one and draw that created texture, but it didnt seem to work at all.  I assume it was because FBOs werent meant to be toggled back and forth quite like that, but I am unsure what else to try.p  pI hope my explanation wasnt too confusing with all the switching between FBOs and what not, but basically I am just looking for the best way to create multiple textures from within the app and then draw each of those textures individually to a FBO without having to retain all of those textures in memory at one time.p  pThis is a stripped down version of what I was trying to do. p  precodepublic static void processImage      mainFBO.begin     gl.glClearGL20.GLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GL20.GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT       draw in background textures     forint i  0 i lt numberOfLayers i             mainFBO.end             Texture tempTexture  processLayer             mainFBO.begin              draw tempTexture with desired settings           mainFBO.end      finalTexture  mainFBO.getColorBufferTexture   public static Texture processLayer      secondaryFBO.begin      Draw all sprites for the necessary layer     secondaryFBO.end      return secondaryFBO.getColorBufferTexture  codepre

I can do it by either defining SERVICEA and SERVICEB as dependencies of Foobar and delegate their creation to service container at constructing stage, injecting them from the outside using setters like setServiceA or setServiceB methods of Foobar, or passing the service container to Foobar to make it able to construct only services that are really needed at the moment.p  pThe first option doesnt seem right for me because it would create both SERVICEA and SERVICEB even if one of them wont be called. The second option is obviously wrong because it exposes the service infrastructure to the outer world. The third option is not good too since it makes the service depend on whole service container that makes code hard to test etc.p  pSo my question is, Is there a way to lazy load service dependenciesp

An approach that would generally work is to explicitly set Include.ALWAYS as the ObjectMappers default, instantiate an instance of the class reflectively, convert it to a map, and examine the keyset. However, classes can still override the ObjectMappers include behavior given annotations. p  pIs there a more elegant approach At the very least, is there a way to override class annotations using the object mapperp  pstrongEditstrongbr Just to clarify, these pojosjavabeansDTOs are designed for use with Jackson and are already rigged with annotations to result in specific serialization behavior.

Negative 62752 pWe have some modifications to Wordpresss .htaccess file which another app to run in the same directory see below.

Negative 62752 pI need a while loop in my Mule Flow to load data in chunks from a custom DAO I use an Expression Transformer to access the DAO until he does not provide any more items.

Negative 62752 pI have been using SQLite 3 for a small website. Recently, I have discovered SQLites full text search FTS capability and leveraged it for a simple search feature. However, a user inadvertently discovered that a hyphen  in the search string does the wrong thing. It seems to indicate that the token immediately following should be excluded. In fact, when I change the hyphen to a plus or a space, it does work.p  pstrongMy questions 1 Am I correct in this analysisstrong I read the a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgfts3.html relnofollowSQLite documentation regarding the FTS featurea and found no discussion about this. strong2 How should I mitigate thisstrong Manually replace hyphens before passing them to SQLitep  pA small, concrete example of what Im seeingp  precodesqlitegt CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ftstable USING fts4    ...gt  content TEXT   sqlitegt INSERT INTO ftstable VALUES Title F1 Race Game Boy sqlitegt INSERT INTO ftstable VALUES Title FZero SNES sqlitegt INSERT INTO ftstable VALUES Title F15 Strike Eagle II Genesis  sqlitegt SELECT  FROM ftstable Title F1 Race Game Boy Title FZero SNES Title F15 Strike Eagle II Genesis codepre  pemThis database is related to old video games, as you might have guessed.emp  pSo the website takes the search string from the user and plugs it into a SELECT statement using the MATCH operator.

Negative 62752 pI wanted to just write some thing silly a few days ago during evening and I thought I would watch elements animate on the simulator just to relax. But it turns out it has caused me a lot of headache for the past 2 days.p  pemstrongBackgroundemstrongp  pI thought I would draw a random letter on every pixels on a screen of 320 X 480.  I would have an array that is filled with 26 letters and make use of codearc4Random  26code to extract a random letter.  p  pFirstly I made use of codeUIGraphicsBeginImageInContextWithOptionscode and the add the image to the image view which gets added as my views subview.p  pemNo problem at all.em p  pBut then I realized, why wait Lets make a 2 for loops outer 480  inner 320 And once the first inner loop finishes, send that array in codedispatchasynccode and have it draw in codedrawRectcode and then when the next iteration finishes, send that to another codedispatchasynccode and so forth until both loop finishes.p  pMy pain began therefrom after...............p  pemstrongReasonemstrong p  pThe forloop is too tight and fast. So I ended up wrapping the 2 for loops within a codedispatchasynccode and within the inner for loop after I send the array containing 320 elements I put a codesleep1code.p  pBut then I realized It beats the purpose wanting to draw faster by making use of codesleep1code. In fact that takes even longer than not using codeGCDcode at all. Over 25 seconds.p  pSo, I went on trying to use codesemaphorecode and create one when only 3200 slots are available before sending the array within a codedispatchasynccode to codedrawRectcodep  pemstrongProblememstrong p  pRace condition. I would get unexpected array out of bounds errors. The errors are not consistent some times it happens later, sometimes sooner. I gather this has to do with not using codeCGDcode correctly.p  pemstrongSo my question isemstrongp  pI know by gut feeling that this can be finetuned and solved with codeGCDcode. But I just dont know how. I am at my wits end.p  pWhat I really want is to be able to update the screens drawing instead of waiting the whole thing gets drawn. Either showing a dot by a dot on the screen or chuck by chuck and not having to call codesetNeedsDisplaycode but, optimally, to call codesetNeedsDisplayinRectcode instead.p  pI thought I would dissect the parts of the drawing elements and send each to its own dispatchasync and each are responsible to drawing only its part and since the run concurrently, it would render the drawing very fast on the screen.p  pBut again, I am out of ideas and ended full of frustration. p  precodeforint y  0 y lt 480 y      forint x  0 x lt 320 x              get a random letter here and insert it into the array myArray          dispatchasyncmyQueue,              dispatchasyncdispatchasyncgetmainqueue,                    [self.myView processRowDrawingmyArray]                  [myArray removeAllObjects]     as mentioned I tried to put a sleep here because the loop is faster the the drawing    voidprocessRowDrawingNSMutableArrayarray      forx  0 x lt array.count x             cell here setNeedsDisplayInRect to draw a row       codepre  pAs for the semaphore version, I simply set a large number in create and signal to call code[self.myView processRowDrawingmyArray]code But since the drawing is slower than the for loop, it didnt help. p  pIs it possible to solve this in a nice and elegant way with codeGCDcode by partitioning the drawing part concurrently and send it to codedrawRectcode and have the parts get shown on the screen bit by bit rather than waiting for it as a whole p  pEither row by row or grid by grid and see them get drawn Again, I would like to use codeGCDcode here.p  pBeen losing sleep on this. Please advise. p  pP.S. I have already tried using codeCADisplayLinkcode.  p

Negative 62752 pI would like to execute a function every second. I used the codeAPSchedulercode and it works fine. However, theres a great performance penalty due to the fact that during each job I recreate the object which handles the connection to a server. I would like to create this connection object only once in the main thread and then pass it and reuse it when jobs are triggered. Problem is the connection object uses codeDCOMcode and I get codeunmarshallable objectcode error.p  pI also tested an infinite loop approach combined with a sleep function but I noticed time drifting in this case. However, I create the codeDCOMcode object only once and performance wise looks a lot better.p  pIs there a workaround the codeunmarshallable objectcode error and continue using codeAPSchedulercode Or, if this is not possible How do I get rid of the time drifting issue in the infinite loop approachp

Negative 62752 pI am using gemfire as my cache. The cache heap size is well above 100GB.

And the amount of memory it takes after all the data is in cache is about 60GB which is the same if I  were to use Java default serialization.li liI tried using a library called Kryo a hrefhttpsgithub.comEsotericSoftwarekryo relnofollowhttpsgithub.comEsotericSoftwarekryoa and that does helps a lot, but i still dont understand why gemfire serialization doesnt help me as i am serializing each attribute of the class individually so there shouldnt be any burden to write class headers and any other meta data.li ol  pAny help would be really appreciated.p

Negative 62752 pIm writing a program that calculates the time evolution of a two qubit density matrix that is a code4 x 4code matrix and I would like to apply certain functions to the density matrix at each time step. For example, a typical function would be codetracerho2code where coderhocode is the density matrix at a particular time.p  pIn Mathematica I can easily achieve this by creating a list of matrices and using codeMapcode to apply the  desired function to each matrix. In MATLAB, it seemed obvious to me to implement my time evolution function so that it returns a code4 x 4 x NSTEPScode array, but then the only way that came to my mind for applying the function to each 4 x 4 matrix was a codeforcode loop, likep  precodefor i  1sizerho,3    pi  realtracerho,,i2 end codepre  pSince Ive been taught to avoid codeforcode loops as much as possible in MATLAB, what is the MATLAB way or the most efficient way of doing such thingp

Negative 62752 pI have a UITableView with rows of dynamic heights, many of which contain UITextViews. When the user starts typing in one of the textviews, I have the cells grow to accommodate the size of the textview content using the beginendUpdates method. Using this method allows the cells to resize without losing keyboard focus on the textview, an important aspect of my app.p  pHowever, when I call beginendUpdates, it reloads the heights for every cell that I have, and I was wondering if there was any way to only recompute the height of a cell at a particular indexPath while the user is typing. I want to do this because my heights for the other cells are expensive to compute as they have dynamic content. I know I could write some height caching code, but I was wondering if there was any method to only recompute the height of a specific cell or set of cells in a UITableView without losing keyboard focus  reloading the data content of that rowp  pI am using ios8, but will take an ios78 solutions.p

Negative 62752 pI have a checklist of items, represented as a Java class.p  pE.g.p  precodepublic class CheckList      private boolean firstItem     private boolean secondItem     private boolean thirdItem      public boolean isFirstItem  return firstItem      public void setFirstItemboolean firstItem  this.firstItem  firstItem       public boolean isSecondItem  return secondItem      public void setSecondItemboolean secondItem  this.secondItem  secondItem       public boolean isThirdItem  return thirdItem      public void setThirdItemboolean thirdItem  this.thirdItem  thirdItem   codepre  pNow I want to calculate a score percentage of how many items in a checklist are checked. My nave way of doing that would be the following method.p  precodeprivate static final int NROFITEMS  3  public double getScore      double score  0     if firstItem  score  1      if secondItem  score  1      if thirdItem  score  1       return score  NROFITEMS  codepre  pThis is however somehow unpractical and seems to be weird especially if the checklist gets longer. Another approach could be to have a list of items which could be iterated over but this does mean cannot limit the items that easily and it also has it flaws.p  pWhat could be a good solution to represent a checklist with Java Thank you for your ideas.p

Negative 62752 pIm writing a program that is supposed to create a triangle and throw an exception if the triangle is not legal, meaning that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. The program consists of 4 classes the super class GeometricObject, a Triangle class, a Program6 class, and an IllegalTriangleException class. The program is supposed to read in data from a file that consists of the lengths for each side, the color, and whether its filled or not, perform calculations to determine the perimeter and area, and write the information to a file entitled prog6.out.

Negative 62752 pIm experimenting with smart pointers and experiencing a problem with the codeuniqueptrcode.

Negative 62752 pIm finally getting around to exploring traits in PHP. The first place I thought Id try it out is injection of config bits into classes. If Im using DIC, I might have code like this in any class that needs a config objectp  precodeprotected function SetConfigconfig      thisgtconfig  config   protected config codepre  pThis seems like a natural fit to traits to avoid having that boilerplate code all over the place, so I might create thisp  precodetrait Config      protected function SetConfigconfig          thisgtconfig  config           protected config  codepre  pand then use it like sop  precodeclass Foo      use Config      public function construct          can now use thisgtconfig       codepre  pThats great. Now lets say I want to create a second trait, say, for loggingp  precodetrait Logger      protected function SetLoggerlogger          thisgtlogger  logger           protected logger  codepre  pWhich I can use like thisp  precodeclass Foo      use Logger      public function construct          can now use thisgtlogger       codepre  pAlso great. Now the problem comes if those two traits want to use each other. It seems quite reasonable that a logger class would need to have a config object injected, which means doing thisp  precodetrait Logger      use Config      protected function SetLoggerlogger          thisgtlogger  logger           protected logger  codepre  pBut then things will break when another class uses both of these traitsp  precodeclass Foo      use Config, Logger      public function construct          want to use thisgtconfig and thisgtlogger       codepre  pThis, of course, doesnt work because the config bits are effectively duplicated in Foo.p  pI could just leave out the codeuse Configcode piece from the Logger trait, knowing that itll be there in the end. But this feels weird to me as it creates a sort of external dependency. What if I want to use the Logger someplace that didnt already have the config trait This solution also means I need to suffer my IDE PhpStorm 8 warning me about unknown methods, and not offering autocompletion. I realize I could fix these problems in turn by using method, but thats just putting lipstick on a pig, so to speak.p  pI could also alias the config bits in Logger, but thats also problematic.p  pAll of this has a bit of a smell to it, but I havent figured out yet whether thats because this is a new pattern for me or if it really is a stinky pattern. Either way, Im not sure the best way to make this approach actually work.p  pAny advice on the best way to solve this problem in traits Or is it better to avoid traits for DIC shortcuttingp
Negative 62752 pI have a C base class with a private stdmap, codequerymapcode that is filled with newd pointers on construction. In the destructor, I go through and delete all of the pointers to avoid memory leaks. Derived classes will be implementing a pure virtual function from the base class, and I want the implementations of this function to have readaccess to codequerymapcode but not write access as doing so will cause the destructor to segfault. Naturally I thought of making the pure virtual function const, but that locks out all member variables as well as nonconst member functions, when really I want to only make codequerymapcode const.

Negative 62752 pI believe that PopupBlockers block popups which do not originate from a users input.  So for example, when a user presses a button to open a new window, the new window is not blocked.  But if you put a setTimeout and tried to open a popup, the PopupBlocker would block it.p  pI have a situation where there is a parent page, and on that page is an IFrame from a different domain containing a JavaScript application.  On this application, there is a menu with a tweet button for example. p  pThe game, then dispatches a postMessage to the parent window. This does 2 things. It populates the tweet with the window.location.href which was denied in the iframe due to security errors so that the URL to this application can be tweeted. It also then calls window.open in a blank window. p  pBut in this case, I am being blocked by a Popupblocker.  Is there any way to somehow specify that this post message was in relation to a user input eventp  pOR Is there any alternative to allow this popup through I can develop the parent as I please to allow it, but cannot find a solution.p

Negative 62752 pI am trying to convert the algorithm as described a hrefhttpwww.it.uu.seeducoursehomepageprojektTDBht13project10Project10report.pdf relnofollowherea page 12 from pseudocode into working C code. The algorithm describes how a convex hull is transformed into a concave hull by breaking up edges that are considered too long into smaller edges. I understand the general idea that the authors propose, but have trouble converting this into working code. Please see below the code that I have got so far, including comments  at the start of each pseudocode line.

It looks like BigCount was compiled just to BigCount, or sth like that.p  pRebuilding the library turned to be tricky itself, and since Im only a little Junior yet, so my Team Lead did that part and I cant tell the details, which I didnt have time to dive deeper in. At least, its a direction you can use to solve the same problem.p

Negative 62752 pI have an Mvvmcross app that has a TableViewController in root. Each row opens a DetailViewController. And inside each one of it, you can edit it in a EditViewController.p  pSo I have a ViewModel for each view. Im dealing with two problems herep  p1  In DetailViewController i subscribe it to a database message. When i close it, i gotta dispose this subscribeToken. So i would need to call this when DetailViewController got destroyed. But cant call it when it disappears, because when I open editViewController it will send a message that DetailViewController gotta listen to.p  pSo I cannot dispose it in ViewDidDisappear method. But the other option would be in ViewDidUnload. But this method is only called in MemoryWarnings. So it is not disposing the token. That is not good .p  p2 The other problem is for each DetailsViewcontroller that i open, i have to save in Settings what is the current id. and then when I leave, i have to remove it from Settings. So the same problem here. If i remove it in ViewDidDisappear it will remove when im in EditViewController, and i cant, it gotta be set there. But then if i remove only in ViewDidUnload it will not be called, and this variable must be removed.p  pWhen should I call the OnDestroy method to both casesp  pIn Android im calling in OnDestroy. Where should i call it in iOSp  pThanks in regards,p

Negative 62752 pIm currently having a problem with angularJS or my understanding of it  I come from a C backgroundp  pIm working on a project which requires elements to be dynamically created cloned from the consequence of being dragged n dropped on page. Once these elements are dropped I want them to be able to be double clicked and a modal appear. Im giving them a custom directive openmodal and then running them through the angular compile service.p  pThis all works great...p  pHowever I need them to be able to access a service I have a service as a proxy to a list of objects, however after being run through the compile service they do not have access to the same objects. I am using the angular.injector methods to get the compile service for the current angular app so I cant see why its not using the same instance of the service a new instance of the service gets created when the element above is run through compile.p  pIm sure its a problem in my understanding of how itscopes work. However Ive found this very difficult to search for given that the word compile is also used when declaring a directive contains compile and link functions and theyre the links that appear most.p  pHere is a a hrefhttpplnkr.coedit2x4zgV7xysSp48bSLrIWppreview relnofollowplunka demonstrating my issue. If you click the Add number button a few times both directives will show the same number as they are using the same service, however after clicking Create Directive and clicking Click to show modal, the modal says the array length is 0.p  pIm pretty sure its something to do with the way I am creating the modal from javascript.p  precodefunction CreateModalDirective        var compileService  angular.injector[ng, numbersApp].getcompile       var scope  angular.elementdivForModal.scope       console.logscope       var element  ltdiv idtheModalContainer openmodal ngclickOpenMyModalgtClick to show the modalltdivgt       var linkFn  compileServiceelement       var content  linkFnscope       angular.element  divForModal.appendcontent      codepre  pThe FirstController and SecondController just demonstrate that they are using the same service, the randomId parameter on the ModalController just demonstrates that I am able to pass through a number to the controller.p  pIf however its not possible doing this from a pure JS function then I may have to look at restructuring in order to achieve this functionality  again pointers would be greatp  pThanks in advance p

Negative 62752 pIn ROBLOX Lua, Im writing a game that involves users creating and running Lua scripts. Obviously, I need to prevent the use of certain services and functions, such as the Kick function on the Player class, or anything related to DataStore or TeleportService.p  pSo far, Ive been successful at making a sandboxed environment by using setfenv to set a functions environment to a metatable, which is attached to a sandbox table. On index, if nothing is found in the sandbox table, it looks in the real environment like it normally would. This allows me to put fake functions in the sandbox table that will be used instead of their real counterparts.p  pHowever, lets say I sandboxed the ClearAllChildren function. Players could easily escape the sandbox by doing thisp  precodesomeObject.Parent.someObjectClearAllChildren codepre  pThis is because getting an instances Parent gives them the real version as opposed to the sandboxed version. This flaw can be pulled off many other ways, too.p  pSo I made an object wrapper. Calling wrapobj on an instance returns a fake version created with newproxytrue. The index of its metatable makes sure any child of the object or instance property such as Parent will return a wrapped version.p  pMy issue is likely with the way I have my wrapper set up. Attempting to call any method on an object inside the sandbox, like thisp  precodex  someObjectGetChildren codepre  pResults in the following errorp  precodeExpected  not . calling member function GetChildren codepre  pHeres the full code for my sandbox currentlyp  precodelocal ENV  getfenv  main environment   custom object wrapper function wrapobj     if pcallfunction return obj.IsA end then  hacky way to make sure its real         local realObj  obj         local fakeObj  newproxytrue         local meta  getmetatablefakeObj         meta[index]  function, key              TODO logic here to sandbox wrapped objects             return wraprealObj[key]  this is likely the source of method problem         end         meta[tostring]  function             return realObj.Name or realObj         end         meta[metatable]  Locked         return fakeObj     else         return obj     end end   sandbox table fake objectsfunctions local sandbox       game  wrapgame     Game  wrapGame     workspace  wrapworkspace     Workspace  wrapWorkspace     script  wrapscript     Instance           new  functiona, b             return wrapInstance.newa, b         end         sandboxed function function run     printscript.ParentGetChildren     printscript.Parent     script.ParentClearAllChildren end   setting up the function environment setfenvrun, setmetatablesandbox, index  ENV  run codepre  pHow can I fix thisp

Negative 62752 pKnowing very little about how to write and even call VBA functionssubs, I am pretty sure that my problem is fairly easy to address  I just dont know how to go about it.  p  pI want to copy different vertically summing formulas from a single column call it column L that appear in random rows to one or more other destination columns.  Rows from which to copy formulas would be identified by values in Column A if cell in A contains a substring which I am already doing with native Excel, and if present, the function is called.  The function tests the formula that is eligible to be copied from ColL to see if it contains another substring in this case, a plus  sign, or a SUM function but it would be nice to pass these as arguments.  p  pThe function would cause the formula to copy from the cells in L to apply to the destination cells, returning the result of the formula applied to the destination column same relative rows as source column.  If the plussign test of the formula string fails, the function would return an error so that the user would know to manually create the right formula for that cell.p  pInput arguments to the function might be a optional, separate strings to search formula for i.e.  OR SUM or other optional values and b relative difference between the destination column and source column.  The function would need to be called from withing a native Excel IF.  Are you out there Obi Wan  Thanks in advancep  pHeres an example.a hrefhttpwww.screencast.comt4vehPGaag relnofollowLINK Walts Budgeta Note that characters subaccounts and subsub accounts can be added during the year, so formulas cannot be created for the whole sheet at the beginning of the year in the Actuals columns of which there will be an indeterminate number.  p

Negative 62752 pOkay, this may sound like a stupid question, but this actually is a real life situation I gotta sort out.p  pThe company I work for is using a rather outdated online shop software PHP which is hosted on the companys server. Unfortunately, the source code is encrypted and the CMS does not allow me to add some PHP code either, so I guess Im stuck with JavaScript on this one.p  pLets say we have a huge sale start coming up and people start sharing links via YouTube, Twitter, and so on. Due to the software being made somewhere in the last century, some links still contain session IDs which will definitely be shared by some users. This, however, will result in multiple users placing orders on the same customer account or even worse, overwriting existing customer accounts with new customer data. p  pI know that this situation is far from ideal and that the software definitely needs and update, but this is not an option at the moment. I also know that Im not getting a 100 solution, so Im just gonna try to prevent people from accidentally wrecking some customer data.p  pThat being sad, I though about checking the URL for a Session ID and checking the value in document.referrer aswell. If the URL contains a Session ID and the referrer is some other server than ours, Ill just do a quick redirect to the main landing page.

Currently I am on NFC, I have studied a couple of tutorials and I start understanding a bit better how it works and how to read and write tags, what I can do now on the ones I bought. Most people want their app to start as soon as they are close to a tag but for learning purposes I would like to start the discovery only when I hit a button, in other words, I want to control the discovery.  I understand that in order to have the app starting immediately, we implement the filter  ACTIONNDEFDISCOVERED in the Manifest.xml I also read that filtering with intents works only if our app is not in foreground. If our app is running in the foreground, it wont be notified, so we have to use NFC Foreground dispatch.p  pWhat I cant figure out is how I can manipulate the filter and the foreground in order they only react to my click of a button.p  pMy other question is  Is it going to work for both Read and Write buttonsp  pCould somebody please help If you give me some code, please be so kind to explain it, I am really after learning and understanding p  pCheers.p

What I have now is run the same code on a master computer. Players send their data to this computer, and when the round is up, the master computer shares this data.p  pHowever, when the user with the master computer leaves, this becomes problematic. I was wondering if I could have this master computer run server side, at all times, and work with all clients at once.p

Many thanks for any help, this is the first question Ive asked so any guidance on where I may have gone wrong would also be appreciatedp  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetutf8gt lttitlegtTestlttitlegt  ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.10.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjqstickyanything.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjquery.waypoints.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ltscript srcmyWaypoints.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction           nav.stickThis        ltscriptgt  ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyle.cssgt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt  ltnav idmainNavgt     ltulgt         ltligt             lta hrefsection2gtSection 2ltagt         ltligt           ltligt             lta hrefsection3gtSection 3ltagt         ltligt           ltligt             lta hrefsection4gtSection 4ltagt         ltligt           ltligt             lta hrefsection5gtSection 5ltagt         ltligt           ltligt             lta hrefsection6gtSection 6ltagt         ltligt           ltligt             lta hrefpage2.htmlgtPage 2ltagt         ltligt     ltulgt ltnavgt   ltdiv idsection1gt      ltdiv classsectionHeadinggt         lth1gtThis is the introduction sectionlth1gt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classwrapgt         ltpgtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Negative 62752 pRecently I learned about REBASE utility and that Microsoft runs it on all OSsupplied modules before shipping Windows. As I understood, if relocating must be done by OS loader during app initialization, this not only impacts on startup time for my system, I dont see any visible penalties, but also impacts on system performance. I never did rebasing for DLLs before. Should I start to do it I understand, that if I should, it would be only DLLs that come with my executable, not the system DLLs.p  pFrom a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10114492whatsthereplacementforrebaseexethis posta I understood that REBASE is a deprecated utility.p  pAlso, if rebasing is still relevant, how can I measure the performance improvementp

So I am able to make different departments within my application such as Marketing and Finance. p  pThe problem is, I know what departments I need to make, and these will be created beforehand but I have made it like a CMS so an admin can edit departments etc.  With the departments created, I envision something like this a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comskHRf.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comskHRf.jpg altenter image description hereap  pSo a user can choose the department from a dropdown remember, this is after departments are created.  When they do this, the document dropdown should populate.p  pThis is my problem, how can I associate specific documents to a department  Each document requires different inputs, so I would imagine they need to be different tables  At the moment I have a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comrOEYN.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrOEYN.png altenter image description hereap  pBut this doesnt really solve my problem whereby I can state that the Marketing department has a Brief document and Overview document.p  pHow could I go about doing this seeing that I do not specifically have a table for each department  Would I need to create one for each departmentp  pThanksp

Negative 62752 pstrongBrief description on what Im trying to achievestrongp  pIm working on a analytics software built using Python, wxPython, and matplotlib. Im trying to implement a function where the program can plot the results after performing some analytical calculations. At the moment, the program freezes when the its performing the calculations and the calculation time takes up to 10 seconds depending on the amount of data so Im trying to use threading to create a nonblocking program to improve user experience. p  pstrongProblem Im gettingstrongp  pI keep getting this error  PyAssertionError C assertion hdcDst ampamp hdcSrc failed at ...... srcmswdc.cpp2559 in AlphaBltAlphaBltinvalid HDC p  pand googling hasnt really help with identifying the cause. p  pIll post the full traceback at the bottom of the post.p  pstrongHeres my codestrongp  precodeimport wx import time  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  from wx.lib.pubsub import Publisher as pub from threading import Thread  def plotgraphx,y,sleeptime     plt.plotx,y     Simulate long process using time.sleep     time.sleepsleep time     Send out a message once process is completed     pub.sendMessagePLOT,empty  class listener     def initself,name         self.name  name         Listens to message         pub.subscribeself.Plot,PLOT         pass      def Plotself,message         print self.name         plt.show         print printed   waiting  listenerBob  t1  Threadtargetplotgraph,args[1,2,3],[1,2,3],5 t1.start t2  Threadtargetplotgraph,args[1,2,3],[1,2,3],3 t2.start codepre  pBasically, the user will be clicking an icon on the GUI and that will trigger a function to perform some analytical calculation simulated by plotgraph here. At the moment, without using threads, plotgraph will block my entire program, so Im trying to use threads to perform the calculations to free up my GUI. p  pHowever when I tried to plot my GUI within the thread, i.e. have plt.show in plotgraph, the plot appears then disappears again. When I click the button on the GUI to spawn the thread a second time, I get the same error.p  pSo Ive tried to work around it by sending a message after the threads ended so that the plt.show will happen outside the thread but Im still getting the same error.p  pI cant seem to be able to find a similar error online, except for one thread posted in 2008. If anyone could help that would be awesomep  pstrongIn a nutshellstrong I need a way to implement sort of a callback function that allows me to perform the analytic calculation in a thread, then plot the graph once the calculations are completed to free up my GUI.

Negative 62752 pHi Im trying to understand how this handshake works and JWT. So I have something as web page where the some user can go and login itself. Then I create an JWT, so when I do request to the server I use this token to verify the user. I would like to create and websoket connection and use this token as well. so I did the server like thisp  precodevar server  app.listen3000, function     console.logServer listening on, 3000  require.websockets.connectserver codepre  pIn that file websockets.js I havep  precodevar    requirelodash var ws  requirews var url  requireurl var jwt  requirejwtsimple var config  require.config var clients  []  exports.connect  functionserver      var wss  new ws.Serverserverserver         wss.onconnection, functionws              var location  url.parsews.upgradeReq.url, true             var token  location.query.token              console.log ws.upgradeReq.headers               console.log New connection.              try                  var user  jwt.decode token, config.secret              catch err                  ws.close                           clients[token]  ws              ws.onmessage, functiondata, flags                   console.log ws.upgradeReq.headers                   console.log data                            ws.onclose, function                 .removeclients, token                 if user                      console.logUser disconnect  user.username                 else                     console.log Authentication failed.                                        codepre  pSo the problem is that, If I login in the broswer and I copy that token which is in the headers. I can connect to the server with different terminal using wscat. So I was trying to understand how that handshake works and can this help me to prevetn this. p  pSo my idea was to get this form the header codeMTMtMTQ0Mjk1OTI3NjY1NAcodep  precode connection Upgrade,   upgrade websocket,   host localhost3000,   secwebsocketversion 13,   secwebsocketkey MTMtMTQ0Mjk1OTI3NjY1NA,   secwebsocketextensions permessagedeflate clientmaxwindowbits  codepre  padd it against the client and in each call form the client to check if that value is the same, but not sure if that the right way. I cant understand it very well so if some one can explain that woudl be great, or what I can use to prevent this hijacking if I dont have ssl connection.p
